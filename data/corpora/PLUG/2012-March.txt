I'm fairly excited that you guys are jumping right into this. I've only
setup PXE boot installs for single OS, but here's a recent article on how
to do it for multiple OS'.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PXEInstallMultiDistro. Do we have a
Server box? If not, I have a Free Geek Dell box that we could use.

We have sufficient space in the PLUG cabinet to house a normal size
desktop box, and we can always borrow a keyboard, mouse and monitor for
those occasions when we need to use it. In other words, having a
dedicated server could become a standard Clinic feature.

I assume you want your Free Geek Dell box back. But if I understand
things correctly, a server need not have a lot of RAM, CPU horsepower,
or even disk space, as long as it has enough space to hold the distros.
I have a box of the Windows 98 era (HP D7316A) that I would be
delighted to donate. I obtained this box free as a discard found in
a rental house. It needs a network card, and it has only 96 MB RAM and a
9.6 GB hard drive, but that should be enough for DSL or Puppy, and I
wouldn't mind buying a second hard drive for it at Free Geek. I also
have some leftover network cards.

In fact, I think I am going to fire it up this afternoon and see if it
will run. There may be a serious reason it was discarded.

I plugged it in and it booted.

The good news is that the BIOS says it has 192 MB RAM and a 400 MHz
CPU. Also, it booted to XP Professional, so the original owner must
have upgraded the RAM and then the OS, since I know it shipped with
Windows 98.

The bad news is that I could not find out the size of the hard disk
because I could not get either a keyboard or a mouse to work. I tried a
couple USB mice and a couple PS2 mice and, while the BIOS said it
recognized the PS2 mice, neither would work. Also, neither of the USB
mice would work, although they lit up. I also tried two different old
keyboards and a brand new USB keyboard, and neither would work. I
couldn't do anything else without at least a mouse or a keyboard. 

Also, the CD drive seems to be stuck. The light comes on during boot.
And if I press the eject button the light comes on and I hear whirring
noises, but the tray does not come out. The people had small children,
so it probably has the remains of a popsicle inside. I have some
leftover CD drives, so maybe I will replace it if I can figure out what
is wrong with the input devices. It might make a decent Linux computer
if I can repair it.

it's a desktop PC with 4 GB RAM and it has more than 100GB HD and 3 NICs.
For the short term I don't mind bringing it to the PLUG clinics to see how
well the PXE installs work for folks. There really isn't any reason a
laptop with sufficient memory and HD space couldn't be used for this too.

I too considered the downside, but decided that the hassle of having to
carry a USB stick with my private key was trumped by the risks of
allowing password-based auth.

I've never heard of a single breakin occurring with private-key auth
that was due to true SSH protocol or encryption weakness.  Failures
in the human side of the process, however, have been known to happen.

I use a _very_ long passphrase (over 30 characters), that would be
meaningless to anybody else but has gotten to be pure muscle memory in
my fingers so I can type it very quickly.

Missed that one.  Seems to be limited to Debian's RNG, and affects
only the key generation process, not the protocol itself.

Huh, that's interesting. Although the bug that was created, ironically
enough by a erroneous bug fix, affects SSH Keys due to the entropy of the
seed being reduced to 15 bits the vulnerability is in the OpenSSL
libraries. Ouch!

One of the things I always find interesting about security vulnerabilities
is that no one ever talks about true risk. Just because there's a
vulnerability doesn't mean someone is going to come knocking on your door
to exploit it unless you have something of very high interest or value to a
potential cracker.

If I understand this correctly the "possible attempted break-in" messages
are mass script attacks attempting to exploit common usernames and keys
whereas with the RNG bug someone would have to intentionally and
specifically run an attack against the RNG to generate the correct key.
That is, I'm thinking this level of attack is not from a botnet script that
just throwing common usernames and passwords at every SSH open port on the
internet it can find.

You can also use a passphrase when generating your SHH pub/priv key pairs. An
SSH key passphrase is a secondary form of security that gives you a little
time when your keys are stolen.

Probably the quickest way would be to enclose $NEWIP and $OLDIP in 
double quotes.

    if [ "$NEWIP" != "$OLDIP" ];  then

OF course this will not fix the actual problem of why either of them are 
empty.

As far as the URL.  I get an error when I use the "http" version but get 
through when I use "https".  (That is after I accept the certificate.)

First thing I'd do is put quotes around the variables in the test:

    if [ "$NEWIP" != "$OLDIP" ]; then

This ensures that both variables are actually strings, which is
all the != operator understands.

Second thing would be to put some rudimentary error checking ahead
of the test, after $NEWIP is set:

    if [ -z "$NEWIP" ]; then
        echo "FATAL: curl did not return a new IP"
        exit 2
    fi

Third, run the script with the -x flag:

    $ bash -x ngetip.sh

This puts bash in xtrace mode, which makes debugging much easier.
It will let you see what is being returned for $NEWIP.  Once you
know that, you can set up your input filtering.  Or you could
simply add echo statements in strategic locations.  Whatever
works for you.

Hope this helps,

Rod,

   Dale suggests this, too, so I made the changes.

   I see an error getting newip (if one exists) only infrequently. The cron
job runs each 15 minutes and I saw this particular error only twice this
morning. Most common case is no error.

Thanks,

Rich

    Errors checking for the current IP address have happened only 4 or 5
times since the switch to DHCP. No way to predict when it happens. And, when
it does occur, the next check (in 15 minutes) works properly.

from what I understand, bash can handle an empty string, as long as it's
quoted.

this strongly suggests a problem at the other end, at whatismyip.com.
perhaps resulting from load related issues. there are a lot of people using
it in this way. I wonder if your dynamic IP host has any equivalent service
to offer you?

because you reported this, I went and checked my own script using
whatismyip.com - and it's broken too. this leads me to believe they have

the result I'm getting is:

<html><body><h1> HTTP/1.1 500 Server Error</h1></body></html>

your script uses this test:
if [ $NEWIP != $OLDIP ];

using the variable substitution, it will appear to bash like this:

if [ <html><body><h1> HTTP/1.1 500 Server Error</h1></body></html> !=
1.2.3.4 ];

where 1.2.3.4 is your supposed old IP address. This is, of course, far too
many arguments for an equivalency test.

Now that you have corrected the script to quote your variables, it will
look like this:

if [ "<html><body><h1> HTTP/1.1 500 Server Error</h1></body></html>" !=
"1.2.3.4" ];

which is indeed two singular strings, which can be compared. and since they
are not equivalent, the test will pass!

which means.....

    echo $OLDIP
>     echo $NEWIP
>     echo $NEWIP > "/home/rshepard/CURRENTIP"
>     echo $NEWIP >> "/home/rshepard/getiplog"
>     <curl commands removed.>
>


all of this will be executed! I assume that the <removed curl commands> are
what updates your dynamic DNS host. which means that when
whatismyip.comreturns an error, your script will attempt to update
your dynamic DNS host
with the error message as your new IP!

have fun with that.

update: right now, I am _consistently_ getting an error every second time I
make a request. every first time, I am getting a successful result.

I see they are using load balancing on this URL to handle the load. this
leads me to believe they have some servers out of service right now, while
others are working. now we just need to find some contact info for them so
we can inform them....

That looks useful and I was bored so I wrote it in python.  When I played
with it, I found the server would intermittently return text that loks like:

this right after assigning the value to NEWIP

wes,

   You are correct that the problem is at their end:

<html><body><h1> HTTP/1.1 500 Server Error</h1></body></html>
50.43.7.160

   Saw several of these starting at 11:30am. I'll move the query to 7 after
the quarter hours and see if that avoids the rush hour crowds.

   Doesn't appear to work that way. At least, not yet.

   I may yet bite the extra cost and switch ISPs to regain a static IP
address and avoid all this hassle.

I'm sure somebody can write this neater, but you could use something like this:

#!/usr/bin/env perl

use warnings;
use strict;
use LWP::Simple;

my $external_ip = "";

sub external_loc_func () {
	my @fields = "";
	my $location = "unknown";
	$external_ip = get 'http://www.hostip.info/';
	my @ext_ip_arr = split ('\n', $external_ip );
	foreach my $line ( @ext_ip_arr ) {
		if ( $line =~ /IP address:/ ) {
			@fields = split ( '\s+', $line );
			@fields = split ( /<?..>/, $fields[3] );
			$external_ip = $fields[1];
		}
	}
}
external_loc_func;
print "External IP: $external_ip\n";

You could just find a better site to get your IP; sdf.org/ip is
pretty good.  Or maybe whoever manages the PLUG site could add a
My IP page; it's just a server side include value IIRC.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1203031421270.14554@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I hope someone here is fluent in wicd 'cause I can't figure out the
solution to a problem.

   Context: new Sony Vaio laptop running Slackware-13.37/x86_64 with
wicd-1.7.0.

   When invoked with 'wicd-client -n' from the command line, up pops the wicd
network manager showing our local AP at 100% right on top. But, when the
'Connect' button is clicked the network is not immediately attached.
Instead, I keep getting the error that the pre-shared key (PSK) password is
incorrect. But, when I log into the WAP and check, the PSK password is just
what I set it to, and the same as I enter in the client laptop.

   What might I be doing incorrectly here? This is the last hurdle in the
race to get this new laptop fully up and running.

Thanks,

Rich

   Methings I've a protocol mis-match between the WAP and the laptop.

   On the Asus WL-520GC for Authentication Method I selected WPA2-Personal.
(Selecting Shared Key changes to WEP encryption.) WPA Encryption is set to
AES (the only choice), and I've entered the desired WPA Pre-Shared Key.

   On the Sony, wicd's GUI manager shows our network as WEP (not WPA), but
the Use Encryption checkbox is checked and the protocol is WPA 1/2
Pre-Shared Key. The PSK is the same string as on the WAP.

   If this is how it should be, I'm totally befuddled why I can't connect to
our network.

   Nope. I checked. According to Wikipedia, WPA2-personal is the same as WPA
1/2 Pre-shared Key. The article recommends a passphrase of 8-64 printable
ASCII chars; I had 8 and expanded them to 14. They match on the WAP and the
laptop.

   Does it matter if I set wicd for static IP address or DHCP?

   I'm completely out of ideas.

Hello all,

I imagine that there are quite a few (old) sysadmins, developers and 
Pythonistas lurking on this list who are also interested in this 
question.  I'm one of them, I suppose, and I couldn't help but want 
to add a point or two.

Rich--I think you have gotten quite a bit of help so far in this 
question (which you brought up a few weeks ago).

I will observe that you are encountering many of the problems 
inherent in working with and relying on networked services.  
Sometimes those ervices aren't available, sometimes the code on the 
other side is broken, sometimes the code on your side is broken.  I 
learned an amusingly relevant expression from a very experienced 
developer.  'My code inhabits a hostile universe.'

So, here are some tips that come to my mind as I read this thread.

  * if you are writing a file where it is important that the file 
    is either written completely or not present, consider using 
    filesystem atomicity to guarantee that the data in the file are 
    good; here is an example:

       set -e  # -- exit whole script if any command fails
       DATAFILE=my-critical-info
       URL=http://some.flaky.org/information 
       curl --silent --fail --output "${DATAFILE}.tmp" -- "${URL}" \
         && mv -v "${DATAFILE}.tmp" "${DATAFILE}"

       # -- if we made it here, $DATAFILE fetched $URL and wrote completely

    if you don't understand what filesystem atomicity is and/or what 
    it affords you, it is worth it

  * if you are reading a file that you know should have contents
    check it for non-zero size before reading; depends on how 
    paranoid you are

  * and, I'll pick on Dwight's solution (thank you for sharing your 
    example, Dwight)--there can be many sorts of strings which 
    contain four dots, so why not by a bit more assiduous and make
    Python do the work for you; let's assume that your data are 
    normally valid IPs, then use the old easier to ask for 
    forgiveness approach

    Instead of:

      if len(result.split('.')) == 4:

    Perhaps something like this (which assumes False, and/or 
    raises an error if something other than socket.error occurs):

      import socket
      def validate_ip(ipstr):
          ipstr = ipstr.strip()
          try:
              packed = socket.inet_pton(socket.AF_INET,ipstr)      # -- network order
              if ipstr == socket.inet_ntop(socket.AF_INET,packed): # -- back to str
                  return True
          except socket.error:
              return False
          return False

For those from the old school, you'll note that I used inet_pton() 
and inet_ntop() instead of the rather venerable inet_aton() and 
inet_ntoa().  Why, you might ask?  Well, according to the ancient 
rules of socket programming, the following is true (and ghastly, to 
my mind):

   >>> socket.inet_ntoa(socket.inet_aton('010.010.010.010'))
   '8.8.8.8'

Octal?  No thanks.  I'll specify the address family, thank you very 
much.

   Thank you, Mike. I'll look at your references. When I searched the Web I
found lots of ubuntu threads on fora but this laptop is running
Slackware-13.37/x86_64 and there is no network manager.

   Germane to the wicd-1.7.0 bug, I wonder why it bites here and not
elsewhere. I am running the same wicd version (from the same Slackware
subscription DVD) on my Dell laptop with no issues at all. But, when here in
the office that host is connected by a cat5 cable and I use the wireless
only when I'm elsewhere. And it works everywhere else.

   The older laptop that this Sony is replacing worked with either wicd or
network manager (it runs xubuntu-11.10) at coffee shopts and other places
but not here.

   This suggests to me that there's something related to how either wicd in
the laptop or the Asus WAP is configured that authentification fails. I can
see that wicd connects to the WAP but times out failing to accept the PSK.

   I suppose that I can try the wicd version from -13.1.

Regards,

Rich

results. I'll look now at the URLs you listed.

Subject: [PLUG] Clinic has a computer
Message-ID: <20120304110632.756e4737@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I had an old HP Pavilion that tenants abandoned when they moved. It had
192 MB RAM, a 400 MHz Celeron, a 9.3 GB hard disk, a floppy drive, and
originally shipped with Windows 98. It was missing the network card.
The tenants had upgraded to XP Professional.

It now has 384 MB RAM and a 200 GB hard disk ($20 from Free Geek), a
working Intel 10/100 NIC, and Lubuntu. The RAM, NIC, and a couple other
things were leftover parts I had around the house. There are two empty
PCI slots for other NICs or stuff that might be useful. I'd like to add
a USB 2.0 card, because it has two USB ports and I'm sure they're only
1.1.

It works great and boots incredibly fast, albeit a tad slow in
operation because of the ancient CPU. However, there is an issue with
the additional RAM. According to HP it can take up to 128 MB PC133
cards in each of its two RAM slots. It had a 128 and a 64, so I decided
to swap the 64 for a 128. However, all I had around the house was some
256 MB sticks. So I just stuck them in and booted it. The BIOS
recognized the RAM but gave an error message "upper memory limit
exceeded, E953." The original XP would not boot, nor could I get any
Linux OS to install on the new 200 GB hard disk. 

So I replaced one of my 256 MB sticks with the 128 MB stick. XP on the
original hard disk still wouldn't boot, but Lubuntu installed and works
fine on the new disk. Using top I find that Lubuntu is apparently using
all 384 MB, in spite of the BIOS error message. Nevertheless, I'm
trying to find out if there might be a BIOS update available. 

The BIOS is Phoenix 4.0 version 6.0.J. For Windows users there is a
free program that will get the required information and tell you if
there is an update. Absent this program, apparently I need the serial
number in order to find out if there are updates. Google told me to use
dmidecode, but all dmidecode tells me is "I see nothing." All I can
figure out is what the boot screen tells me:

Phoenix BIOS 4.0 Release 6.0.J  4/28/99
(C) 1999 by Hewlett-Packard, Inc., Rev. 1.12
Core version 4.06

Can anyone suggest alternatives to dmidecode for figuring out details
of the BIOS? Or does anyone know more about Phoenix BIOS updates?

Message-ID: <CAJeYwHdVq7dkQ8fdFNG1c1Kc6L3HMwrLhNOCwhPiV=kSro1SPA@mail.gmail.com>

My Toshiba Satellite A505-S6970 laptop running Ubuntu 10.04 recently
abruptly stopped running after I restarted it 3 times.  A subsequent
investigation revealed that the BIOS caught an overtemp condition and
powered off.

Unfortunately this caught the hard drive updating files and so the system
had to recover inodes upon boot up.

Question:

Is there an easy way to integrate the BIOS notification into the kernel?
How can I prod the kernel into coming down gently and not let the BIOS
hammer the computer into power off?

Just curious how others have successfully done this?

Thanks for your input!

I've been bitten on many occasions by the mute feature. After an 
installation I couldn't get sound, and then found that the default after 
the install was for the sound out to be muted. Doesn't make a lot of 
sense, but that's what it was.

My suggestion would be to run a system monitor program like GKrellM.
This little app has an extensive list of monitors, including
motherboard sensors.  You can set warning and alarm temperature
limits, each of which can trigger a command to run.  Set the High
Alarm limit to some temperature below the BIOS shutdown point, and
have it trigger a shutdown.  Set the High Warn limit to display a
warning that your machine is overheating, and it must SHUT DOWN NOW,
OR ELSE.  Or something like that.  :-)

I think the major desktop environments also have similar functions.
Though as I recall, Gnome's was a resource hog.  One advantage to
GKrellM is that it's really quite light.

Of course, you really should figure out why your laptop was
overheating.  Was something running the CPU full tilt, and causing the
temperature to spike?  Is there lint blocking the fan(s)?  Has the fan
stopped working?  In my experience, laptops don't overheat unless
something untoward has occured.

Anyway, I hope this helps.

Is there lint blocking the fan(s)?

Yes, a lot of it which was subsequently blown out with a propellant can 
of gasduster.  After that, the temperature dropped to a "mild" 62-63 C, 
but stayed steady day or night.

Thanks for the suggestion.  I will look into it.

Message-ID: <CAArUT0i1+yUYRTA4RN4sGy0FAdz15cFuepe=SA_VHhJEgS4f0A@mail.gmail.com>

I have just started with Comcast.  I am presently renting an Arris
TM402P for $7/mo.  I am looking to purchase my own modem.  Comcast
lists many compatible modems
(http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/mydev.php?tier=-1&h=0&d3=0&s=v&so=0&e=0&sc=536),
but it is clear that not all the listed units match what is needed.  I
assume that only units designated "Telephony" will be suitable, as I
am getting voice service through Comcast.  This restricts the choices
to Arris (23 units in the list, but if I lump NCS, IMS, and SIP
together, the count is 9.)

Questions:
What do the NCS , IMS and SIP designations mean?
What does the D3 column in the modem list mean?
None of these show support for IPV6.  Does this matter?
Any Linux-related issues with these units?  The Arris TM402 seems to
be working fine.

Thanks,
-Denis

Very interested in this. I was told that only the rented unit was compatibly with Comcast voice service. If this is not the case, I'd like to hear it. 

I need fax capability, and with the triple play, my cable service is actually more expensive without voice service.

These are all architecture, protocol and call signaling standards for the
delivery of voice network (PSTN) and ip multimedia services over cable
modems.

Some of the functionality this provides is that in theory you can take a
SIP phone and just plug it into the cable modem network as an endpoint.
Vonage uses SIP to provide voice over ip telephony services. The
PacketCable spce
adds SIP internetworking support for the development and delivery of
services such as instant messaging, IPTV, video telephony.

Note that most of these services can already be delivered via IP and the
Internet. Cable providers want their services to be the way people interact
with the Internet. It's their way of trying to get control of the end
customer. Which is why they've been fighting with VOIP providers and large
multimedia content delivery providers like youtube, netflix, google, et al.

IPv6 compatibility only matters if for one if you are employing IPv6 on
your computers or two if your service provider stops supporting IPv4. Most
service providers just started supporting IPv6 in the past couple of years.

My personal preference would be to use a SIP trunk provider and a SIP
softphone on my laptop and smart phone. I've played around with google
voice & pbexs.org over wifi on my android phone. It works okay for short
calls but I have a cell phone as backup.

The real benefit of rolling SIP into the cable modem specs is that the
network is able to provide end to end quality of service for telephony and
video. On the public internet, you can mark packets with QOS parameters but
no devices are obligated to honor those QOS settings. So the quality
fluctuates due to congestion, equipment failures, etc.

When I signed up for Comcast (moved to Beaverton from Austin, TX in
January), I scoured the web for a supplier of compatible modems,
but was unable to locate anybody that would sell me the Arris
TG852G.  I ended up just leasing one from Comcast.

A quick search turns up

http://stores.ownyourmodem.com/-strse-114/Arris-TG852g,-Arris-modem,/Detail.bok

but the breathless "get yours before they run out" hype makes me
wary.  These telephony-capable modems seem to be very hard
to find.  At $230 that's 33 months of lease fees, without
having to worry about finding a new one if it breaks.

I agree about the "breathless" comment.  But why 852?  I have the
slowest contract rate.  The 402 is rated up to the "Performance" speed
tier.  My use is residential.  If you need the 852, then waiting 'till
buying one makes sense.  I am looking lower down the performance
(price) ladder.

Best Buy is listed by Arris as their rep. for consumers.  They do not
seem to have any Arris products.  I did find a 402 used on line for
$25.  Having no way to test it I gave it a pass.

Subject: [PLUG] USB3 external drive - wicked fast!
Message-ID: <20120306063309.GA9000@gate.kl-ic.com>

I bought a 2TB Seagate USB3 external hard drive for $120
from Costco, as a backup drive for my wife's office.  I
also bought a $26 PCIe x1 USB3 dual port card from Plugable
via Amazon: http://plugable.com/products/pcie-usb3-sp/ 

The combination is wicked fast.  I hacked a little C program
to write a gigabyte of 512 byte buffers to a randomly named
file, rename it (to evade kernel caching), then read it back. 

On the internal SATA-2 drive, the program wrote at about
43 MB/s, and read back at 19 MB/s.  On the USB3 drive, it
wrote at 112 MB/s, and read back at 75 MB/s, about three
times faster.

Plugable is very Linux friendly (they provide FAQs and
tech support for users with Linux issues).  This card is
plug-and-play for 2.6.31 and newer kernels.  Of course,
you need a motherboard new enough to have PCIe slots.

I am also tempted to buy a Plugable $20 ExpressCard/34 
USB3 interface for my laptop (or talk John Jordan into
getting one for himself), and see how fast that operates.

Office Max has what appears to be the same 2TB drive (not
sure) for $110, on sale from the normal $170.  Also 4GB
USB flash drives for $6.

   Office Max sent me two discount cards: $10 off purchases of >=$20. I'll
use one to buy one of these drives. The other's available to anyone who
wants to save $10.

And I love encouragement, it helps me know my efforts are helping,
and it encourages others to provide hardware reports as well. 

Thanks!


BTW, I don't have the Seagate drive or the box handy, but the usb
id is 0bc2:50a5 Seagate RSS LLC,  and the iProduct is GoFlex Desk. 
( lsusb -v -v as root ). 

Some Seagate GoFlex drives are only USB 2.0, buyer beware.  

This drive works with both USB2 and USB3, and comes with a special
3 foot USB3 miniB (drive end) to A (computer end) cable that works
with both old and new standards.  There are five extra pins on the
USB3 A plug, not connected for USB2, adding two ultra high speed
signalling channels for USB3. 

The USB3 standard permits up to 16 foot cables, and PCH Cables in
Hillsboro (http://pchcables.com) has some 6 and 10 foot cables.
Pat also has some 15 foot A extenders, but those sound dubious
and error prone given the signal speeds involved.

Message-ID: <CAPGcbtCu-Mgsq1cC7WjBReb-AM7O9ip_Sdz+ei405PgLSYRvew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Some of you may remember me, I used to be pretty active in the group
years ago :)

I've been off in the Solaris world for the last few years but I'm
interested in working with Linux again more. I was thinking about
pursuing a certification and I wondered what recommendations people
have about that.

I passed the first LPI test years ago, I'm sure it's no longer valid.
But back in the day it seemed like LPI or Redhat certification were
the main choices.

I'd appreciate any feedback on this, but if all you have to say is
that certifications are worthless in general you can probably save
your breath :) Part of the idea is for me to dig back into Linux, and
I think it could be useful from that perspective, regardless of how it
might help with employment.


Thanks,

Rich

My feeling is that the redhat certification is pretty useless as an
educational experience.  I was made to take the "pre-qualification"
test (what they have online) for a job application (I wasn't
challenged by it) and there were bugs in 2 of the questions (one with
2 correct answers and one with an answer that was clearly included by
accident).  When I tried to report the bugs to RH they were
unable/unwilling to even direct my report to the right place, though
they were happy to call me for months to try to sell me on paying them
to take a test and get certified "for real".

Whether it's useful on a resume or not I couldn't say.  As an
occasional hiring manager, I'm far more interested in what you know
than what pieces of paper you have (or, what you got out of achieving
the certification *other than the piece of paper*).  I guess the
useful information I can say is go check out the test they have online
(https://www.redhat.com/wapps/assessment/tx/begin?asmt=sysadmin) and
see what you're missing (i learned that i hadn't used their new
partitioner, so i went and spun up a VM and did a few test installs
and then went back and aced the only part i hadn't the first time
through).

I don't know about certifications, so this a more general observation 
about a fundamental change that's coming down the pike.

There's been a lot of work done to retire the System V-style init 
scripts and runlevels. The main goals, as I understand them, are to 
increase startup parallelization (for speed) and to provide better 
ways of spelling out dependencies (to avoid the brittle nature of the 
S?? and K?? symlink naming structure).

So while the current versions of Debian and RHEL (and its derivatives 
like CentOS) still pack init scripts into /etc/init.d/, bleeding-edge 
distributions like Fedora are starting to use "systemd," one post-SysV 
implementation:

  * http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd

A project with similar goals is called Upstart, but my reading of the 
literature suggests that systemd has a greater likelihood of future 
success than Upstart.

It'll probably be a couple years before any of the distributions 
marketed at the entrerprise ship with systemd as the default init 
system, but I'd suggest gaining at least a reasonable level of 
familiarity with it during your Quest for Learning(TM).

Well, to be fair, upstart is already in use in ubuntu and has been for
over 5 years, so it's got pretty wide adoption (you can also still use
sysv scripts there but they are mostly deprecated).  However I agree
that systemd is the future.

init in RHEL6/CentOS6 is upstart too, FWIW:

[dyoung at dyoung ~]$ rpm -qf /sbin/init
upstart-0.6.5-10.el6.x86_64
[dyoung at dyoung ~]$ cat /etc/redhat-release
CentOS release 6.2 (Final)

My understanding is that it's more or less strictly in "legacy" SysV
compatibility usage though.

But yes, Paul's point is taken. Times change and systemd appears to be
the way forward. As long as "chkconfig" and "service" continue to work
(that's how I roll), it's all good.

   Not my week for hardware, it seems.

   I'm trying to read the Slackware-13.37/32-bit DVD using xcdroast (latest
release) so I can write it to a blank DVD. For some reason I've not figured
out, xcdroast does not see any disk in the CD/DVD optical drive.

   If anyone's seen this issue and overcome it, please pass me a pointer in
how to do this.

   Got it worked out: needed the correct file name.

Brian has been using native Linux Containers (aka LXC) to solve
a need for increased security and isolation while avoiding the
overhead of virtualization.  In this talk Brian will discuss:

* Where containers surpass virtualization
* What containers cannot do
* Why he selected LXC instead of OpenVZ or similar products
* Network configuration choices
* Setting up a Linux container
* A demonstration

After the main meeting a subcommittee will convene to study the
best application of containers (holding beer) at the Lucky Lab.

Subject: [PLUG] Firefox forgot what program to open a ZIP file with
Message-ID: <20120306210021.684d710f@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Firefox is forever forgetting what programs open what kinds of files.
Just now it has decided that .zip files should be opened in gedit. It
used to know that it was an archive, and I don't know what might have
caused it to suddenly decide to open .zip files in gedit. 

Now, if I was trying to open the .zip file in a file manager (Nautilus,
Thunar, Dolphin, etc.) I could use the drop-down and select "other,"
which would give me a list of installed programs, including Archive
Manager. But in Firefox the "other" option just lists all files in ~/.
The list of files in ~/ is not useful. I need the binary, which is
probably in /opt or some / folder. Unfortunately, the name of the
program in the applications launcher menu is "Archive Manager," which I
know is not the name of the binary. It's really difficult to search for
the binary when I have no idea what it is called.

I also tried Firefox Preferences, which lists ZIP archive. It is
currently set to "always ask," in spite of the fact that the download
popup window offers gedit as the default. There is a drop-down in the
Preferences dialog box, but it behaves the same way as the file download
popup window - that is, it just displays data files in ~/, not actual
installed programs.

I also tried about:config, but searching on "zip" didn't reveal
anything that looked useful. 

It appears that my only option is to download the file, open a file
manager, select the file, and specify to open with Archive Manager.
After unzipping it I have to go back to the file manager and delete
the .zip file. This is not only a waste of time, but will inevitably
lead to orphaned zip files that I forgot to delete.

Does anyone know how to tell Firefox what to open files with?

The only way to get around this annoyance (and yes, it's happened
to me, too), is to feed it the actual name for the program you
want.  If you're running Gnome, it's probably
/usr/bin/file-roller.  (That's what Gnome insists on calling
"Archive Manager" in the menus.  Can't be confusing the poor
lusers with actual program names, now can we?)  When Firefox pops
up that whutdoido? dialog box, click on browse, and type the
absolute path and filename into the address bar.  Then click Open,
and Firefox should be happy.  After that, FF should remember what
you did before, and will present that as the default option.

Hi Chris,

Thanks, I appreciate it.

I remember that the LPI test I took did make me refresh myself on some
things I'd forgotten. There was a big focus on text processing which wasn't
exactly my strong suit, I did actually learn a few things studying it.

I don't expect a certification is going to get me a job. I've been working
with Linux/Unix for 15 years, my job experience is going to mean much more.
But I figure it can't hurt, and I thought I might get a bit of a refresher.

I will check out that link.

Hey Paul :)

Yeah I remember you as well :) I hope you're doing well. I am going to try
to drop by a meeting sometime soonish.

Thanks a lot for the info on the init changes, that is definitely the kind
of thing I'm looking to get up to speed on. I'm planning to poke around and
the latest CentOS for starters.

you might consider taking a look at Fedora as well.  Systemd is standard there as of v15 or v16.

The Red Hat "pre-qual" tests bear very little resemblance to the actual
Red Hat exams. 

The questions on the "pre-qual" tests are multiple choice and fairly
simple for most Linux users with at least a little experience. (At the
moment, the pre-qual tests are 404'ed, so that might be changing.)

The questions on the actual Red Hat exams are lab-based, specifying what
you might configure on a "live system". While the NDA prohibits
describing specific tasks, the published objectives suggest that it's
done with SELinux enabled in enforcing (or permissive) mode. Big
difference.

Here's a list of what you might do on the first two Red Hat exams:

Hi

I would say the Certification plus the experience is a plus..  As others
have pointed out.  The test my highlight a weak area you have..

Good Luck

My resume is littered with mostly worthless certifications save a few.
Those few are the ones where I had to
configure and troubleshoot from the command line of fully functional
equipment in a lab. Nortel's version of a CCIE.

If you want book knowledge to get you through an interview than that's all
well, good and fine. But if you want really want to "dig back into
Linux" might I suggest the following:

Attend Linux Clinics and help other people solve problems. Participate in
online forums such as PLUG and help other people solve problems.

 Whenever I interviewed people for jobs I always asked them so tell me
about the most interesting hobby project you've done or tell me about your
home computer / network setup. To that end, there's a great site that I use
often that has hundreds of interesting tutorials for on the installation,
configuration and  administration of different OSs, virtual machines,
servers, apps and services. http://librenix.com/admin/

As someone's email signature on the PLUG list reads. "Be appropriate,
follow your curiosity".

Cheers,

Mike

Thanks for the name of the executable. 

Unfortunately, the popup window in Firefox doesn't have a place to type
a path and filename. All you can do is select "other," then navigate
to /usrbin/file-roller and select it. I did so, and it worked, but then
I repeated the action and Firefox went right back to wanting to open
the file in gedit. There was no "always use this program" button.

But knowing the name of the executable I was able to effect a permanent
cure by going into Edit > Preferences > Applications. I still had to
browse to /usr/bin/file-roller (no address bar to type in), but Firefox
now remembers what to use to open a .zip file.

The present problem is solved, but what will I do next time a program
wants to know what to open a file with and I don't know the name of the
executable? There was a recent discussion here about how dpkg / apt /
apttitude and other package managers do a lousy job of keeping track of
what is installed. I might suggest a simple text file to which every
package manager must add the name of package, the name of the executable
and its popular name; and remove same when the package is uninstalled.
I shouldn't have to wander all over the internet to find out what
programs are installed on my computer and how to launch them.

I've more or less relegated myself to mailing-list-only membership. 
There've been some great meeting topics of late, but my schedule and

CentOS 6 will give you a good view of current enterprise Linux. Fedora 
16 -- or if you're really brave, the alpha release of Fedora 17 -- 
will point you toward the future.

Fedora 16, in particular, has forced me to add systemd stuff to my 
shellcommand rules. If I push out, say, an updated version of 
/etc/smartd.conf to my hosts, I now need rules for Debian systems, Red 
Hat (and derivatives) using SysV, and Red Hat (and derivatives) using 
systemd:

   smartd_reload.debian::
     "/etc/init.d/smartmontools reload"

   smartd_reload.redhat.!systemd_s::
     "/etc/init.d/smartd reload"

   smartd_reload.redhat.systemd_s::
     "/bin/systemctl try-restart smartd.service"

If you've got hardware capable of it, another good avenue to 
investigate is KVM and native Linux virtualization. I use CentOS 6 
with KVM to host several Debian, CentOS, Fedora, and even Windows 
virtual machines.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1203070822130.26627@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have a 4.2G .iso to burn onto a 4.7G DVD. Reading the FAQ and xcdroast
manual section on writing to DVDs, I downloaded the most recent (2005)
cdrecord.prodvd (the changed name of the downloaded file when moved to
/usr/lib/xcdroast/bin/ with 755 perms and ownership of root.root).

   According to the xcdroast manual section, when I start the application I
should see a dialog box that acknowledges the presence of cdrecord.prodvd.
No such message box appears.

   Each time I select the .iso file to write, I get an error writing tracks message
in the dialog box. The log window does see cdrecord.prodvd, but cannot open
/dev/sg*.

   The progress output is:

   Once again, I found the solution myself after posting a request for help.
My apologies to the list.

   The solution was to re-scan for devices. This changed the SCSI bus for the
optical drive from 3.0.0 to 5.0.0, and it's happily lasering away as I
write.

Mea culpa!

Denis,
    It's never been a concern for me, but then I run OpenWRT in a very much
non-stock configuration.  Just like any other distro, it's not as secure as
it could be out of the box, but can be improved substantially with a little
effort.  There's some good tips on the open WRT wiki.

On this subject, the intended equipment (Ubiquity AirRouter) defaults
to "SOHO router" mode.   I cannot say I really understand the
difference between "router" and "SOHO router", but I have the
impression that I can use "router" mode to do what I want and it would
be more secure.  I will have one desktop wired to the router, the
router wired to a Comcast modem, and very occasionally a laptop
connected via wireless.  Is this impression re: security and function
correct?

Thanks,
-Denis

   Assign a WAP2 pass[word|phrase] to the WAP and the portable (network

My guess is that "SOHO router" implies NAT, while "router" does not.

Again, just a guess.

My perception is "SOHO router" is meant to designate a pathetic little
router you might use for a few people, distinct from big iron routers
meant for more enterprisey environments.

My "SOHO router" is doing IPv6, so NAT not necessarily involved ;-)

The presentation is from 2010.  I would expect that the vulnerability,
such as it was, has been mitigated by this point.  I know there have
been multiple dnsmasq changes since then, it's quite possible one of
them addressed this.

My skim/reading of the article implies that a remote attacker might be
able to get access to an otherwise LAN-only-enabled admin interface.
However, without the password, even that shouldn't help.  Set a
password. ;-) Also, it seemed to require older browsers to exploit.
My admin interface is ssh ;-).

The AirRouter's stock firmware requires a password for access to the
admin interface, and if you set your own password it won't be easily
guessable you should be fine.

Yeah, that's how Firefox is set up.  I suppose they expect the
user to go through the Preferences settings and make sure that all
the default executables are set to what that user wants.  A bit of
an annoyance, given the size of the file-types list that Firefox
has, but it seems to be the way Mozilla likes it.  Truth to tell,
I'm not sure how else they could handle it.

I think you want to look at the freedesktop.org site.  These folks
are trying to set up a scheme of specifying file-type to
executable relationships.  From what I've seen, there's a lot of
work to be done.  What they've got so far looks interesting.

As for finding out which package has what file in it, the package
manager should be able to tell you.  On the RedHat/RPM side of
things, "yum whatprovides \*/myfilename" will tell you what
package contains "myfilename".  There is also a "yum search ..."
form which can come in handy.  I'm sure that the Debian/dpkg side
has something similar.

Finally, I should apologize for the tone of my previous post.  The
sarcasm was intended for Gnome, not you.

But the congestion on the fiber is nothing compared to I5 so it's
really not much of an issue. 
And if you happen to have Megapath DSL your
traffic is going there anyway.

"ifconfig <dev>" will report the HWaddr (i.e., MAC address) for <dev>.

"ip link show dev <dev>" does the same thing, but calls the
address "link/ether".  (See the ip(8) man page.  It's complex.)

Or, if you're using NetworkManager, right-click on the info-tray icon
and select "Connection Information".  That will display info for
whatever interfaces are active.  If the device isn't active, select
"Edit Connections..." instead.  Select the device, click "Edit..." and
select the Wired tab on the edit window.  Viola!

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1203101050400.27252@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I think that I've identified the problem with the Sony Vaio not connecting
to my WAP, but I've no idea how to fix it.

   First, I changed the PSK password on the WAP to a five-digit hex number[1]
and rebooted the router after saving the change. Second, I changed the PSK
password in /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf to match. The edited
/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf has the actual password changed here:

# See /usr/doc/wpa_supplicant-0.7.3/wpa_supplicant.conf.sample
# for many more options that you can use in this file.

# This line enables the use of wpa_cli which is used by rc.wireless
# if possible (to check for successful association)
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
# By default, only root (group 0) may use wpa_cli
ctrl_interface_group=0
eapol_version=1
ap_scan=1
fast_reauth=1
#country=US

# WPA protected network, supply your own ESSID and WPAPSK here:
network={
   scan_ssid=0
   ssid="AESi"
   proto=WPA RSN
   key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
   pairwise=CCMP TKIP
   group=CCMP TKIP WEP104 WEP40
   psk=1a2b3c4d5e
   priority=10
}

# Plaintext connection (no WPA, no IEEE 802.1X),
# nice for hotel/airport types of WiFi network.
network={
   key_mgmt=NONE
   priority=0
}

   Third, I ran

wpa_supplicant -Dwext -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

and saw the following (password changed from reality):

[root at pachy /etc]# wpa_supplicant -Dwext -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
Line 22: Invalid PSK '1a2b3c4d5e'.
Line 22: failed to parse psk '1a2b3c4d5e'.
Line 24: WPA-PSK accepted for key management, but no PSK configured.
Line 24: failed to parse network block.
Failed to read or parse configuration '/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf'.

   What is wrong with the PSK that wpa_supplicant fails to parse it because
it consideres it invalid? This must be the problem regardless of what I have
as the PSK.

Thanks,

Rich

Russell,

   The .conf file had the "your ESSID here" in quotes, but not the PSK. I
assumed that was meaningful. Anyway, my Web searches found others with the
same problem, but putting the PSK in double quotes does not always solve the
problem. Here, when I quote the PSK I see a related, but different error:

root at pachy /etc]# wpa_supplicant -Dwext -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
ioctl[SIOCSIWSCAN]: Device or resource busy
Failed to initiate AP scan.

Authentication with 20:cf:30:88:cc:2b timed out.

   And this continues until I press ^C. I also tried 'killall -HUP
wpa_supplicant' and wicd-client but still cannot connect.

   My other portable has no problem connecting which makes this all the more
puzzling.

Thanks,

Rich

Ken,

   Sigh. I thought that was it because this new laptop does not have its MAC
address in the WAP access list. So, I took off the three addresses in there
and restarted the router. Still no joy. That's before trying wpa_supplicant
from the command line.

   None of this makes sense to me. The new Sony connects to wifi hot spots
elsewhere, but not here. My Dell connects wirelessly everywhere, including
here. Round and around I go ...

Thanks,

Rich

According to a co-worker who used to work at Sequent, he's certain they

When i was on the computing staff at Reed College in the early 90's, we 
had 2 of their 386-based MPP machines (donated), running Dynix. i 
believe those machines debuted before Intel started using x86 chips in 
their own MPP boxes.

I have been getting very frustrated trying to survey the model choices
of netbooks.  Asus has a comparison chart but it lacks the 1200
series.  If I try to do comparisons using their (very limiting) "pick
5", the resulting chart often has lots of missing data, and some
models cannot be entered.  Further, their cryptic model names/numbers
provide no clues.  I am sure that all this is on purpose, but I am not
sure what that purpose is.
<end rant>

I am looking for long  battery life, no heavy processing demands.
Have not decided between 10 " and 12".  I solicit opinions on typing
on the 10" vs the 12".  I have a low-end 9" that is just terrible to
type on. Can you knowledgeable folks help me narrow the choices?

I don't know whether it's current, or even accurate, but wikipedia

All of the State Universities in Oregon had Sequents. OSU had several, PSU,
UofO all had them. It seems that other schools got them as well.

We got some of the early National boxes and then had some upgrades to the
x86 boxes.

That ended up being a great training ground for Future Sequent Employees.
Many of my students ended up working at Sequent.

I know that I should remember what the OS was when we got these, but I
don't.

Thanks, Galen.  That is the best so far, but it seems to have some
holes, and limited info on the 12" units.  It lists the battery life
to be considerably shorter than Asus does.  Must be REAL data.

If you are looking at Netbooks, have you considered an ASUS  Transformer 
Prime?  Has a WiFi radio on board a very good display and has a keyboard 
accessory that makes it turn into a "netbook" look alike.  Add a 
Wireless USB device...

Just a thought.

I appreciate the suggestion, but I do not need a super camera, super
video, etc.  And a review dated 1/3/12 stated:
"XDA forum members collectively erupted in rage yesterday after it was
discoverd Asus locked down the Prime?s bootloader. Apparently 128 bit
encryption is employed to keep owners from accessing key components
and flashing new roms and kernels onto the tablet. The Prime is
effectively grounded. This move prevents owners from unlocking the
full potential of the tablet. Owners are at the complete mercy of Asus
for system updates and improvements (like the current GPS and WiFi
bugs). So much for Android being ?open?."

Not a good thing from a Linux user's perspective.

I believe this is old news. See below.  But if the device doesn't suit 
your needs then there is no point in pursuing it.

"It?s finally time, Eee Pad Transformer Prime owners: Asus has graced 
you with its promised bootloader unlock tool. If you don?t want to waste 
precious seconds reading, click this here link 
<http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&m=Eee+Pad+Transformer+Prime+TF201&p=20&s=16> 
to get to the download page. Select ?Android? in the OS pull-down menu, 
then click ?Utilities?, then click the download link under ?Unlock

work if you?ve updated your Transformer Prime to the official Ice Cream 
Sandwich ROM, and like all bootloader unlocks, it will wipe your 
personal information completely."

Lewis & Clark had one. It has 200 cavernous MB of storage that the CS 
students used for their FTP loot.

Historical milestones include the time someone lost their shoe in it and

Subject: [PLUG] Limoncelli on the Fear of Rebooting
Message-ID: <alpine.OSX.2.00.1203120836350.65322@springwater.galois.com>

Tom Limoncelli has a fine blog post on his fear of rebooting a server:

   http://everythingsysadmin.com/2012/03/fear-of-rebooting.html

"Every time I reboot a machine I fear it won't come back up."

His solution set is simple, but not easy:

  1. Reboot, change, reboot. (The first reboot is interesting.)
  2. Reduce the number of services on a machine.
  3. Better testing.
  4. Better automation.

I score pretty well with #2 and #4, not so well on #1 and #3. (I tend 
to outsource #3 to the package managers at CentOS and Debian, which 
may not be a terribly trustworthy approach.)

Subject: [PLUG] Is there a non-server way to benefit from include files for
	web sites?
Message-ID: <4F5E3C7D.7090903@comcast.net>

I'm working on a small HTML project to display the story of the 
Victorian house we restored about 20 years ago. I want to give a copy to 
a preservation group that's interested in it. The problem is that I am 
using php on my home Apache installation so I can use include. However, 
I won't be posting it on a php enabled server. Include is the only 
feature of php that I need for this project.

Is there some other tool I can use that gives me the advantages of include?

One alternative is to physically include the contents of those files in 
each file that calls them after I finish the project and change the 
references to xxx.html instead of xxx.php. That will be cumbersome, but 
doable. The way I provide the finished project to the preservation group 
can be via a cd or on my Comcast web site -- which doesn't support php.

Apache has an include
feature:
<!-- Set the title and slogan!! -->
<!--#set
var="title" value="OR Randonneurs" -->
<!--#set
var="slogan" value="Cycling Further in the Northwest"
-->
<!--#set var="pageID" value=" " -->
<!--#include virtual="/head.html" -->
<!--#include
virtual="/lnav.html" -->
<div
id="content">

wget also has
options to build a locally self contained version of a web site you crawl 

from the wget man page:? "Wget can be instructed to convert
the links in downloaded HTML files to the local files for offline
viewing."? As I recall it uses relative links so you'd be able to
forward the tree of goods to them to install on their site with minimal
effort.

You can play a trick with Javascript to do local includes I think.  Try the
techniques listed under Client Side includes on this page:

Yes. But that's a server.

That looks promising. I can use wget on localhost. I'll give that a try.

Yes, but
a standard Apache install with no external modules required.
Meaning they
may have it already and not know it.

I don't know if they have an in-house server. I want to supply them with 
something that doesn't require one.

It depends some on what your access needs are. If you don't need your
server to be able to accept SSH connections from the entire Internet,
you can at least cut them way down.

I have seen this script at work:

http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/

It allows you to block IPs that make failed SSH login attempts. There
are other scripts out there that do similar things.

Subject: [PLUG] Reminder utility
Message-ID: <20120313004852.40549c2f@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I don't know why I can't find this. I'm probably searching on the wrong
key words.

I want a tiny, simple GUI utility that will pop up a bubble on my Xfce
screen an hour before a doctor's appointment. I can do this with my
Android phone, but I don't sit in front of my phone all day.

The key word in the above is "simple." Cron is a thousand times more
program than I need or care to take the time to learn. I just want
something simple that will remind me of appointments.

I tried remind, calendar, and Xfce panel timer, but none will pop up a
reminder before a set time. The Datetime Xfce panel widget does not have
the functionality either. 

Any suggestions?

If you put the appointment in Google Calendar and keep Google Calendar
open on your desktop it will pop up and remind you. Plus if you have
your Google account associated with your phone it will remind you on
your phone also so you only have to keep the appointment in one place

This assumes you set the reminder type for the event to Pop-up and the
time to one hour.

then meet cron's little brother at, already installed and running on

Try using Yumex (instead of plain yum) to search for "calendar" or
"remind".  IMO, Yumex is easier to use for searching.  That said,
and given that I was looking for something like this myself, I did
a bit of searching and found a few items you might be interested
in.

* Osmo -- A "personal organizer" (fancy name for calendar
program).  This one may be what you're looking for.  Set the date
and time for a "task" and it will pop up a notification (with
optional beep) at the time you set.  You'll have to set the
"half-hour to go" notification yourself.  By default, it has a
fairly large calendar display.  However, you can hide it in the
info tray.

* Orage -- Calendar / Reminder program for Xfce.  Has a small
calendar (unlike Osmo), but is a bit more awkward to set up.
Unlike Osmo, you can tell it to sound the notification in
advance.

* TkRemind -- GUI front end for Remind.  Works reasonably well,
though the Tk GUI isn't as nice looking as the other two.  It has
plenty of functionality, though, and could easily serve your
purposes.  (For fun, I set up an "Appointment with Darth Vader.  Don't
be late." reminder.  Pops up every five minutes, and sounds an alarm
SF/X file that I have.)

Anyway, I hope this helps.

   On my Slackware systems 'apropos calendar' produces:

cal []               (1)  - displays a calendar
orage                (1)  - Calendar for the Xfce Desktop Environment
orage []             (1)  - Calendar for the Xfce Desktop Environment
zshcalsys []         (1)  - zsh calendar system

   I'm sure one of these can do reminders.

If I understand it correctly at will execute pretty much any command I 
could call from the terminal. Is there a command that will send a simple 
line via e-mail to someone other than myself? My wife wants a reminder 
to do something once a week, on Saturday. She runs XP so cron isn't an 
option for her. But it is for me. I'd like to put a command to send her 
a reminder e-mail on Fridays.

if you want it to repeat, just use cron. you can use the "mail" command to
do what you describe. I used to do this to send text messages to my phone
as reminders before I switched to google calendar.

this will do what you describe:

0 19 * * 5 echo "remember to do that thing tomorrow" | mail
wife at email.example

reply with any changes you need made and I will be happy to tune it for
you. else, you can view the man pages for crontab and mail.

I keep this as the first line of my crontab:

#min hour date month d-o-w(0-6 sun-sat)

the # makes it a comment, meaning cron will ignore it. the rest describes
what the first 5 fields of the cron entry are for.

Sounds simple enough. I haven't used cron for a few years but I remember 
it wasn't too hard to figure out.

Looks like there's a little more required in order to send an e-mail 
from the command line than just executing the command. To see what it 
would look like I tried the following:

rsteff at moonguide:~$ "This is a test" | mail -s "Testing" rsteff at comcast.net
Null message body; hope that's ok
Please install an MTA on this system if you want to use sendmail!
Can't send mail: sendmail process failed with error code 255
rsteff at moonguide:~$

What program(s) constitute(s) the MTA (I assume that means Mail Transfer 
Agent)? And if I install one, will that affect my normal e-mail activity 
in any way?

You are correct about the meaning of MTA. I would not be able to answer
your question about affecting your normal e-mail activity without
understanding your normal e-mail activity.

did you try mailx? whatever email system your distro comes with may have
some other way of submitting emails from the command line. If you can shed
some light on what that is, I will see if I can find any other helpful info.

Oops. Better, but still have to figure out what MTA to install.

Normal e-mail activity is with Thunderbird.

rsteff at moonguide:~$ echo "This is a test" | mailx -s "Testing"

Google tells me that Postfix is the default MTA for Ubuntu 10.04. It 
also mentions "Configuring Exim to serve as a lightweight, send-only 
SMTP server" as another option.

My question is whether this has any effect on my use of Thunderbird for 
the rest of my e-mail activity.

And the second question, is one of those two programs "preferred" over 
the other? Both of them are available through Synaptic and so, in 
theory, shouldn't be too hard to set up.

You might also look at SSMTP as an alternative to a full MTA since all you
want is outbound email.  It's very easy to configure and can authenticate
on your behalf against various SMTP servers (to include google, which I
use, and probably comcast - but you would need to test that to verify that
it will actually work in your case).

It's also available in the Ubuntu repositories.

Here are Ubuntu instructions for connecting Postfix to Gmail, that worked
for me, the last time I tried.  I believe this is what you would get
working so the mail command would work.

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GmailPostfixFetchmail#head-1486e0007b80d2c2bbbf7c731139a73ea3bb0570

I also believe that Thunderbird, or other POP interface access to gmail
will be unaffected by setting up Postfix.

Good Luck.

you should not have to set up either postfix nor exim just to send emails
out.

it should not. I can't imagine any way that it would, anyway.

I would prefer something more simplistic. I'm afraid I don't have any good
options for you off the top of my head. I hope someone else does.

On my system, I use a little util called "sendemail" which just
automatically forwards locally submitted stuff to my relay host. It doesn't
even stay running and listen on the network. I don't really remember how it
works beyond that.

Both of these would be overkill for your purposes and you will likely to
have your email blacklisted if you try sending from a residential address.
Indeed  I think Comcast will just block your traffic before it gets
anywhere, or at least divert port 22 traffic to their mail server.

You should look at SSMTP (Simple SMTP) which is designed explicitly for
the type of task you want. It's easy to set up and allows you to use
authenticating SMTP servers as a relay. ( I have it setup for a local
reminder script and it takes all of 6 lines of config  to relay out via
google from any network I plug into.)

Description: extremely simple MTA to get mail off the system to a mail hub
 A secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to your mail
 hub. It contains no suid-binaries or other dangerous things - no mail
spool to
 poke around in, and no daemons running in the background. Mail is simply
 forwarded to the configured mailhost. Extremely easy configuration.

 WARNING: the above is all it does; it does not receive mail, expand
aliases or
 manage a queue. That belongs on a mail hub with a system administrator.

Actually he does for the purpose of a command line
driven message thingy. mail, mailx and mutt all expect there to be a local
sendmail stand in. [ this assertion comes from a quick read of man pages and
Googling.? It would be great to be wrong. ]

Thunderbird and
the rest of the graphical crowd, developed in a different era, all have the
networking built in to use a remote MTA.

Paul's suggestion to use
ssmtp is great.
postfix can also be configured to do just that.

mutt, a great text email client that is a drop in replacement for mail
and mailx mentioned elsewhere can forward to a remote MTA - meaning your
ISP.

http://wiki.mutt.org/?MuttFaq/Sendmail


How do I configure Mutt to use a remote SMTP server to send mail?

 Mutt can't do so directly (read the MailConcept to understand why
this won't change). You must specify a local MTA to do it. The MTA must have a
sendmail compatible interface to be used with $sendmail. See LightSMTPagents for which to
use, configure, install. 

 Update: Recent versions (1.5.x) of Mutt has built-in SMTP support.   

 If the smtp option is enabled during the compilation, you just need to 
add the following lines in you ~/.muttrc or ~/.mutt/muttrc 

 
    set smtp_url="smtp://yourusername at smtp.example.com:587/"   
 set smtp_pass="yourpassword" 
If you omit the smtp_pass, Mutt will ask you to enter the password when
sending mails.

 For older versions of mutt without smtp capability, one simple alternative
is the sendmail.py script:

My search for a Netbook has been frustrating, and here is one
explanation: http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/why-the-linux-netbook-crashed-and-burned/9156

So what is a late-comer to do?  Has the long battery life, moderate

completely out of stock.  I have yet to explore the X10x series, but I
see the X101 with Meego has a puny 4 hour run time.  Useless.  Even
the 1200 series seem hard to find.

If the Vaughan-Nichols article is correct, the Atom may be disappearing.

Any suggestions for where to look and what to look for would be welcome.

CTL makes a Netbook that runs Ubuntu 11.10 out of the box and you could 
also buy a Dell Mini and just install your favorite Distro? I know 
Ubuntu runs fine on most of the mini's my fiancee and my best friend's 
wife both have mini's running Ubuntu.

Indeed it is. It was a simple install. I found examples with Google 
showing me what needed to be in the config file. I successfully sent 
myself a test message from the command line.

To use ssmtp from the command line requires the use of sudo. If I put 
the call in crontab does that mean that I don't have to use sudo?

I have been thinking about a Toshiba Thrive. It's an Android pad with
touchscreen. It does not need a phone account because it does not do
2G-3G-4G. Instead, it uses just plain WiFi for connectivity. But it's
not a netbook.

Richard,

You should continue to use mailx (or other tool) for the command.  ssmtp
will pick up the email and forward it on (if it's configured correctly).

something like:

echo "Don't forget the doctor's appointment" | mailx -s "Reminder"
user at domain

mailx will hand it to ssmtp and ssmtp just takes the message coming from
mailx and forwards it to the appropriate MTA that is configured (in
/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf) for delivery to the user(s).

mailx should NOT require root/sudo.  Neither should ssmtp (it's just
running as a background "service" (kinda) and takes what it receives from
mailx and forwards it to the MTA.  I hope that's clearer.

Paul,

Larry T has suggested a possibility of relocating it to the Lloyd
Center area. Evidently he has the possibility of a space there. Another
option is to bring a generator. I know Keith has a small Honda that
would be adequate for the few computers we need to run. A third option
is to cancel the Clinic altogether. And a fourth option is to move it
to the following Sunday.

I have no axes to grind here. Any of the options are fine with me,
although I would hope that completely canceling the Clinic could be
avoided. My personal vote would be either the generator or a different
location, with notices of the location on the door at Free Geek. There
are many who may be coming and who do not read our list regularly,
e.g., those who heard about it on Calagator and other venues.

I want and need a reasonable keypad.

I have recently found that Office Depot has some on-line: Asus
1016PT-BU27, 1016PT-BU37 and a 1215N-PU17.  The latter is larger for a
more comfortable keyboard, but the -BU27 has a very nice battery time
of 10+ hrs compared to the 1215 of 6 hours.  I will have to pay a
visit to try the 1016-sized keyboard.  I hope it will be adequate.  I
also hope they actually have the units and not just a website which
has not been updated.

-Denis

Dick,

   You can put the script in root's crontab. I don't use sudo, but try 'sudo
crontab -e' and see if that's root's crontab.

I know of at least one person that does not read the list, but I think was coming this month. I've told him that I will let him know if the clinic is moved.

I should have added that another argument in favor of not canceling is
that this is the week several people were planning on doing the net
installation demonstration.

I always use Yumex unless I need to install something that was not in
the repositories. I'm just a bad searcher.

I should have mentioned at the beginning that command line tools are
not suitable for me. I almost never have a terminal window open. I also
should have mentioned that browser based calendars are not what I want
either. I already have too many tabs open all the time.

Orage is the winner! I have it configured and working great. Not only
does it do exactly what I want (and nothing more), but I learned
something from it. I was trying to change the way it displayed the date
and it said I could use any strftime code to change the way it
displayed things. I had never heard of strftime before, but now I have
a web page bookmarked where all the possibilities are explained. Very
handy knowledge to have.

Thanks for the tips!

   It doesn't. I use a mailx script to mail individual copies of my
newsletter to recipients.

Okay. No sudo required from the command line for mailx or ssmtp. But 
something wrong with the address in mailx. I tried the -d option in 
mailx, which gives more information and got this:

rsteff at moonguide:~$ echo "This is a test." | mailx -d -s "Testing" 
rsteff at comcast.net
user = rsteff, homedir = /home/rsteff
Sendmail arguments: "send-mail" "-i" "--" "rsteff at comcast.net"


Nothing else happened. No error message, but no mail sent, either.

I tried verbose mode and got this:

rsteff at moonguide:~$ echo "This is a test." | mailx -v -s "Testing" 
rsteff at comcast.net

How do I tell mailx to just use rsteff at comcast.net, and not prefix it

You may want to check how you're formatting / connecting to comcast.  It
may be comcast is adding the rsteff on, in which case maybe you want to
drop the email address.

The other possibility is it's configured inside the ssmtp
(/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf).  It could also be there is some other mail MTA
running that ssmtp is forwarding the email to.

In short it looks like something is adding "rsteff@" onto the
rsteff at comcast you're passing into ssmtp.  (Maybe ~/.mailrc?)

Dick,

   I wonder if this is because you're sending mail from yourself to yourself.
Try sending to someone else; I'll accept your test message and let you know
if it doesn't arrive. :-)

This is weird.

Sending with ssmtp directly works. Could it be something with the 
configuration of ssmtp? Here's what I have:

rsteff at moonguide:~$ cat /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
#
# The following is based on instructions found at
#

Dropping the email address in the mailx command doesn't work.

is there any reason you need FromLineOverride to be enabled? I would try
with this set to no, or removed.

AFAIK, yum searches the Name and Summary fields for a match to the
keyword that you provide.  I'd bet you used "remind", which is
perfectly reasonable.  I got my selection by using "calendar",
which may not be so reasonable.  It's just that I know that
calendar programs are usually what provide that sort of
function.

Of course, it depends on description the developers wrote.
"Project FooBar(tm) keeps track of your schedule!  Yay!" is not
going to show up for either "calendar" or "remind", or
"appointment".  Though it probably would if "schedule" was the
search key.  Unfortunately, this boils down to guessing what the
description might be.  Not the best way of going about things, but
it's what we've got to work with.  (*grump*)

Heh, I'm just the opposite.  I *always* have a terminal window
open, usually with several tabs.  I'd be lost without a command
line in which to type incantations.  :-)  I agree with you about
the browser calendars, though.  Running a browser for something
simple like a calendar is massive overkill imho.

Hey, no problem.  Like I said in my earlier post, I was looking
for something along those lines myself.  Perhaps not surprisingly,
I chose Remind/TkRemind.  It works from both the GUI and the
command line, which I like.  Granted, the GUI isn't very pretty,
but it works, and it's easy to use.

Anyway, I was happy to help, and I'm glad you found what you
wanted.

No idea. That's what was in the example I copied.

Removed. It made no difference, so I'll leave it out.

Here's what the successful attempt looks like:

I would prefer changing the date to the next Sunday instead of changing
the location.  Public Transportation service is horrible on Sundays and
someone would need to verify complete ADA accessibility of a different
location (including bathrooms and ADA curb cuts and sidewalks from the bus
stop to the door of the different location).

off
electricity at freegeek. Thus, we'll need to shut down most of our servers.

Wednesday, March 14th, starting around 10:30pm and going till Thursday
morning
around 8am.

Sunday, March 18th, starting around 1:30pm and ending around 11pm.

Most all of our services will be down, other than the main website. Email
sent
during this time may be delayed a day or two. The actual downtime will
hopefully be shorter than what's listed above.

live well,
  vagrant

It seems very odd to me to have a UNIX(like) system without a functioning 
MTA installed... how do system messages, cron status mails, and the like, 
get sent?  Or do they simply not get sent at all?

If the approval to use comes thru by late tomorrow, The whole Lloyd area
has curb ramps.   The building is used by 2 with MDA (one scooter and one
motor wheelchair/lift transport)  and a couple of other handicapped people.
  There is a full ADA bathroom one floor up by elevator, and an ADA ramp
form the side walk to the floor where we will be meeting.

For the record...
I volunteer for the Oregon Star Party and we're have one of our four annual meetings
at the same time as the clinic.

I'll be available for the April net install demo.

Since I've volunteered and all...

I've never gotten system messages in the several years I've been running 
Ubuntu. I don't recall getting them when I ran SuSE or Red Hat 7, either.

It's been a long time since I did an install but if memory serves me 
correct sendmail is installed but not turned on.

FYI:

John is recovering from an eye operation, and I've got in-laws
visiting.  We are tied to Free Geek by more than electricity;
fast wired and wireless, workspace, keyboards and monitors,
accessability, tools, access to scrap bins for spare parts, etc. 

If somebody else wants to put together something this weekend,
go for it, but I suggest we give it a rest for March, and have
a double extra special Happy Tax Day clinic in April.

Keith

I have five HE tunnels, which means I have 5 x /48 worth of ipv6
space.

Most of them terminate in LA, but one of them even terminates in the UK,
so I can watch iPlay.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1203151721250.30945@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Well, having decided to quit fighting the wireless access from the Sony
Vaio, I ran a temporary cable from the office to the den until I get a
permanent cable through the walls and across the attic.

   Anyway, with the radio turned off (but this does not matter), and the
Ethernet cable plugged in, the system will not see eth0, only lo and wlan0.
Very strange.

   I delete /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules and reboot, but still
no joy. I've not seen this behavior before in any of the 4 Toshibas, 1 Sony
Vaio, 1 ThinkPad, and 1 Dell portable on which I've installed Red Hat or
Slackware. Makes no sense to me that the system will not see the interface.
'lspci' shows an Atheros Communications ethernet chip.

   Anyone have thoughts to share? If so, please do so.

Sigh,

Rich

I would try a few live CDs to see if any of them get it working out of
the box. Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora are usually the best at getting funny
hardware working. If it works with any of them, of course then the task
is to try to figure out how they did it.

That's the only suggestion my limited networking intellect can come up
with.

   Yes, it is. I booted the xubuntu-11.10 dvd and it kept disconnecting me
from the wired network, just like it did on the wireless attempts. Trying
'dmesg | grep eth' yields nothing.

   I suspect it's defective hardware since it won't connect wirelessly or via
Ethernet. Must have a warranty period longer than a month or two.

For what it is worth, I just donated about 35-40 feet of exterior coax
to Free Geek.  But if the later comments are any indication of your
problem, you may not need the coax.

Which Atheros ethernet chip?  Does lsmod show the correct driver for it?

This is a brand new laptop?  If so, the hardware way be too new for
the right drivers to be included in any distro yet.  If it is new, you
should try a bleeding edge live distro, like Sabayon, or Fedora.

Just before leaving for Seattle the other day my Ubunto desktop system said
there were updates. So I told it to download and install and promptly
forgot I had done so until I got home tonight. It was asking to reboot to
finish the updates.  Well it is dead now with a

[0,665225] Kernel Panic - not syncing: VFS Unable to mount root fs on

Is this fixable or will I need to scrap and reload?

Several months ago a grub update trashed things, but the clinic was a few
days away and I was able to get it fixed there.

Ouch.  Ouch, ouch, ouch.  The only thing I can suggest is that you
boot from a live-cd, and run fsck on your / partition.  If fsck
fixes it, well and good.  If not, it's restore-from-backups time.

Also, you should probably run fdisk or sfdisk on your drive and see if
the partition table is still okay.  The boot partition is still alive
-- you were able to get load the kernel and start it.  But one or more
of the other partition entries may be bad.  (I have no idea what your
disk layout is, so I'm just throwing out suggestions here.)

Hope this helps

This is actually a crappy way to ask for help, just so you know.

Since I know from long experience just how awesome Linux is for
applications of every variety, I immediately discount your obvious
ignorance and not want to help you.  I certainly feel no obligation to
prove to you how wrong you are.  The dominant feeling is dismissal.

Work on that.

It is unlikely, given only this information, that anyone will be able
to guess your problem.  What version of Ubuntu?

Kirk> Is this fixable or will I need to scrap and reload?

You might try interrupting the boot and examine the situation from the
GRUB prompt.  It sounds like it's pointing at the wrong filesystem.
The solution might be as simple as pointing it at the right one.

Sounds like you are misconfiguring grub, but that's just a wild guess.

Based on all the weird, unresolved problems you've had I would also suspect
this. Just about all the information
you have put forth regarding this problem defies logic. I know I would feel
a bit more sane knowing that there
is a good reason for all the odd behavior. :-)

Our choices are 1) cancel completely, 2) reschedule for the 25th. I
contacted Paul Munday at Free Geek and he says no problem with the 25th
(no conflicts), but he needs to tell people at tomorrow morning's
meeting. I told him to go ahead and do so.

Accordingly, I have decided to make an executive decision to move this
Sunday's Clinic to Sunday March 25. OK, PLUG has no executives, but
someone has to make a decision.

I have changed the Calagator announcement, but everyone please spread
the word. There will also be a sign on the door before this Sunday.

Someone else has responded with suggestion(s) to help ... my (OT) 2 
cents is to marvel at the number of people who (whether running MS, 
Linux, OSX, UNIX, or what have you) will apply patches/updates/upgrades, 
untested, to a critical machine/OS/application.  We all (including me) 
do it, but it still amazes me.

   I don't know that's the problem in this case. Speaking only from my own
experience with Slackware, patches are well tested before being set free in
the wild.

   What might have happened to the originator of this thread bit me when
upgrading a laptop running xubuntu from 10.04 to 11.10, with a stop at
11.04. The first distribution upgrade worked fine, but during the second
upgrade the screensaver was activated as stuff chruned away in the
background, and would not clear when requested to do so. Turns our there is
some bug in one of the distribution versions that causes the screensaver to
remain. The only solution was to shut down the machine. This meant a
brand-new installation from the 11.10 disk. Serious PITA.

Dale,

   The laptop was built last November and may be too new for the kernel
version shipped on the stock Slackware-13.37/x86_64 disk. This weekend I'll
build a custom kernel from kernel.org if Pat and crew don't have a newer
version in the -current directory.

   Results will be posted. Thanks to all of you who sent comments.

Should be fixable.

There are many questions particulars to how your system was set up for 
us to just say "do this."

Clinic is just nine days away.

And questions that don't assert that Plug members are collectively out 
of their minds for running critical systems on Linux may get more 
helpful responses in this forum.

At my workplace we are replacing most Solaris, HPUX, ... *nix with 
Linux boxes.

Mike,

   Try this reason on for size: the distribution was released in April 2011
with the 2.6.37.6 kernel, and the laptop was assembled and shipped November
2011. It is almost certain that the Atheros Comm. Ethernet chip is newer
than the driver in the kernel. That's what someone discovered on
linuxquestions.org with the same chip and an 'older' kernel. The laptop
shipped with some flavor of Windoze, as they all do. Ergo, it's quite
reasonable to assume the hardware works with a current driver.

   This weekend I'll build a 2.6.28 kernel using the SlackBuild script from
the 13.37 distribution, run 'mkinitrd', edit /etc/lilo.conf, and run
'/sbin/lilo' before rebooting. Heck, I might even try the 3.x kernel.

Hi

My monitor died yesterday..   An LG 21 or maybe 20 inch.  I will bring it
to the clinic next week end and try to figure out if it is fixable.  Its a
FLATRON w2061TO.  Or it looks like that.

Where can I find a good buy on a new/reconditioned monitor.

   Used to be that I could adjust the order of tabs in a firefox window. But,
with version 10.0.x this no longer works. When I drag a tab to a different

You are very right, but after a long day and a nasty drive home from
Seattle, blah, blah.. Anyway Sorry Everyone.

I will see what I can do over the weekend. The Base OS is ( was? ) Ubuntu
10.04.2 LTS. I have found the DVD and booted from it. I can mount the drive
and I can see and navigate through the folders etc.

I don't see a grub prompts as this is the only OS on that box.

More News later and thanks for all  the suggestions

I've not seen this behavior, sorry.  I'm running Firefox 10.0.1 on
Fedora 16, and I can move the tabs around with no trouble.  I do run
with the Tab Mix Plus add-on, but I don't think it affects shifting
the tabs around.

It would be hard to troubleshoot this without at the very least knowing
what Distro/Release you use... Firefox has not removed the ability to
drag tabs to different positions and is very unlikely to do so in the
future.

No problems on Ubuntu 12.04 Beta 1 with Firefox 11
and I checked a earlier version of FF and still not able to
reproduce.

You might try quitting FF, moving/renaming your settings directory
(typically ~/.mozilla), so fresh default settings are created at next
launch. Upgrading from 2.6.x to 10.x is a big jump, and i wouldn't be
surprised if the old settings didn't work seamlessly with a much newer
release.

   Probable reason: I replaced the slackware package with the direct mozilla
download. Just now I re-installed 2.6.36 and the tabs can once again be
moved. So, until I get the Sony networking issues resolved and can finish
building my new server, I'll live with the older version of firefox.

Ya' know, when I initially wrote my response, I typed "well, it's either
that or you have a seriously buggy driver."
Because my distro of choice is Debian, I don't think I've ever had a wifi
card on a laptop/netbook work out of the box.
Best of luck with getting it sorted out.

Mike,

   Thanks for the wish. :-) I'm confident a new kernel will solve the problem
as it apparently did solve the same Atheros Communications device issue on
ubuntu.

Your BIOS may be hiding the bootup messages that would show GRUB doing
its thing.  I don't have to reboot often enough to remember exactly
what it looks like.  Quick Boot, Silent Boot or something, turn those
off for diagnosis.

Yes, I have seen this recently. At the time I had about six windows
open, each with half a dozen tabs. Eventually I needed to restart the
computer (damn Fedora updates!), and when I launched Firefox I was able
to move tabs again.

   Happened here with one window, two or three tabs open. Removed the direct
firefox 10.0.1 installation and re-installed 2.6.36 and the problem goes
away. Shrug.

I have a few non computer friendly friends that I have set up with 
Ubuntu. My advice to them is never install updates. I've seen this type 
of problem with Ubuntu too many times on the list.

Or... grub's timeout value (/boot/grub/menu.1st on my utility box at 
work) could be set to 1 so it flashes by with small chance of being 
interrupted.

 I don't run Ubuntu for this and many other reasons. Is LTS and/or Ubuntu
Server (same thing?), a better option
for people running critical apps who don't want to get burned by auto
updates?

Also, I'm sure Kirk's comment about Linux was purely out of frustration.
But here's a good article on Linux's success and growth.

https://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs/158-jim-zemlin/554920-as-data-grows-so-grows-linux?goback=%2Egde_48682_member_101481441

Linux, if it's good enough to run the Mars Rover, it's good enough for me.

I was able to get to GRUB '1' time and picked the previous kernel which is
.38 vs .39 and the system booted correctly. Since then I can't get the
timing correct to get back into GRUB.  So 2 basic questions.

#1 What line to a I add/change/delete in the config file to make GRUB pause
for say 10 seconds?
#2 Do I just remove the 2 sections referencing the .39 and .39 Recovery
from the config file to get past this error for now?

Thanks

   I use lilo rather than grub, but I have a recollection of finding editable grub
files in /boot. There should be a grub configuration file there that you can
edit to your needs and not worry about making changes on the fly.

LTS is their "Long Term Support" version. 10.04 and 12.04 are LTS as far as I know. 10.10 and 11.10 are supposed to be more bleeding edge.

(see below) but to restate /boot/grub/menu.1st contains an entry for 
timeout
That's what needs to change.

Better to grok the file and make the .38 the default.

#1 My grub configuration is in /boot/grub/menu.lst.  Yours might be named
differently, but it should be similar and obvious.  Set the "timeout" value
to 10.

#2 You apparently have several stanzas for different boot options.  You'll
also have a "default" parameter, which identifies which stanza to use by
default.  The stanzas are counted starting at zero, so if you want the
first stanza enter 0, second stanza enter 1, etc.   You may also have a 
"fallback" parameter, which tells grub what to boot if it can't boot the
default (e.g. kernel not found).  If you choose to delete a stanza,
you may need to renumber your default and fallback values.  For
example, if your default is set to 4 and your fallback is set to 6 and 
you delete stanza 2, you need to change those values to 3 and 5
respectively.

So delete a stanza if you wish, or just change the default to be the 
one you want.

Good luck.

Subject: [PLUG] Backup of system on a Asus Netbook
Message-ID: <CAArUT0ghjqcP91O=NHAg_BUpRfBWYJ-D3CtNmKxpYRaqxUCF5A@mail.gmail.com>

I just purchased a use Netbook.  It has Win 7 (crippled).  Before wiping it
I would like to make a restore copy for the future.  The instructions are
listed below.  My question is what is a Memory card?  Is this different
than a USB stick?

Instructions:

Back up the recovery files
1. Repeat the step 1?2 in the previous section.
2. Connect a USB storage device to your Eee PC and click Backup in the
Recovery System dialog box to start the recovery files backup.
? The size of the connected USB storage device should be larger than 16GB.
? Memory cards are not supported for this function.
? A dialog box appears as a reminder if you have not connected the USB
storage device for system recovery backup to your Eee PC.

3. Select a desired USB storage device if more than one USB storage device
is connected to your Eee PC and click Continue.
4. All the data on the selected USB storage device will be cleared. Click
Continue to start the backup or click Back to backup your important data.
You will lose all your data on the selected USB storage device. Ensure to
back up your important data beforehand

5. The system backup starts and click OK when done.


Thanks,
-Denis

Memory card = SecureDigital (SD) most likely in this case, many
laptops/netbooks have a built in memory card reader.  These are the cards
usually used in digital cameras.
Physically it is different from a USB stick, but under the hood they are
both flash memory.
Basically they want you to use either an external USB hard drive, or a USB
flash drive for this operation.

So it sounds like you found your netbook- what model is it?

I have an older Acer A150, with an 8" screen, running Linux Mint, which my
wife uses currently.

That is what I finally concluded.  Now the question is, why do they say

She must have small fingers.  I have an old 9" that I cannot type on.  (It
also has a design flaw in that the battery is run down even with the

I think they are referring to an SD card.  The EEE's I'm familiar with
all have an SD card reader in the right side.

A few months ago there was discussion about the Plug email list archives
not being indexed by search engines.  My experience this morning shows
the problem was fixed.  I don't recall seeing an announcement that the
web admins had fixed it.

While I would totally agree with you about the process for production machines, I'm not sure its practical to extend that philosophy to home systems.  For home systems, I prefer simple/straightforward backups.

I need to have the tee command fflush(stdout) immediately, rather than

immediate results.

Or is it better to use the tail -f command instead in this case?

What have you used?

Agreed - I think we've beaten this to death and future

Subject: [PLUG] How to detect ppp address change remotely?
Message-ID: <4F65405D.4070305@qorvus.com>

Hello all,

We have several installations of embedded wireless routers (running 
slack on a 2.4 kernel) in which the gateway router_1 uses a Verizon 3G 
USB modem (ppp0) as its connection to the outside world, and one or more 
downstream router_2 have 5.8Ghz wireless links to router_1, and thus 
route traffic to the outside world through the same ppp0 3G connection.

Verizon has a habit of constantly changing the ppp0 IP address often 
sometime several time per hour. I would like to figure out a way that 
the downstream router_2 can be made aware of that ppp0 address change at 
router_1 within a minute or two of it happening. The obvious way seemed 
to be running a cronjob traceroute from the router_2 to a known outside 
IP, with a limit of two of three hops, and grepping the first public IP 
and looking for the change. However, for some reason that shows the 
Verizon gateway router on their tower as the first public IP rather that 
the locally assigned ppp0 public IP address. Any suggestions for how to 
determine that ppp0 IP using standard tools and pref. without writing 
e.g. inter-router communications scripts etc. would be welcome.

verizon_tower------------------[3G_modem(ppp0)]-[router_1]---------------[5.8Ghz_link]----------------[router_2]

Thanks,

Tom S.

Tom,

I'm a little confused. I'm not a routing guru by any means though :)

But there's a NIC in the gateway router? Why aren't the downstream routers
using that as their default gateway? And then it would handle the routing
to Verizon?

Message-ID: <CAEP779Ff23DbcGm07VuaX1Q9UXfPTR6ORsORfysrHGW99HgSjQ@mail.gmail.com>

First I live mostly in Windows and a set of IBM hardware called Power
Systems. I am a educated 'user' not an admin on any PC based OS so here
goes my story.

I was able to boot from the CD and then poke around on the hard disk. With
help from the list here I found the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg.  Never did
find the suggested menu.lst I believe someone mentioned. This files first
line is DO NOT EDIT this file. I made a backup and then edited away. There
are many groups starting with menuentry and ending with a }  . I removed
the 2 sets referring to the -39 kernel and saved the the file. The system
now boots. If I run update-grub it would read the folder with the boot
images and would put the -39 entries back in. So for now I I have deleted
all the files
from the /boot that had the -39 in the name then reran update-grub and all
is well or at least back to working.

Still having a problem finding the actual parm(s) to set so grub will pause
a few seconds on boot before starting the default. Maybe I will bring it to
the clinic next weekend.

Thanks for the help and for tolerating a grumpy user.

You're not confused - they are using the gateway router, and it is 
handling the routing to the internet. They need to know when the 
gateway's ppp0 IP address has changed for reasons unrelated to their 
routing of data, having to do with a somewhat wierd custom DDNS/IP 
camera/event-alert thingy. I didn't want to get into explaining all that 
wierdness tho :-)

router_2 could be able to run arp to find the ip address of router_1.
router_1 could run ifconfig to find out its own address

Neither arp not ip n show the ppp0 address on either router, probably 
because of the noarp option being selected (don't think I have control 
over that but will check).  Ifconfig does of course, but that only helps 
on the gateway router, not the downstream ones. And as mentioned before, 
traceroute just skips the local IP ppp0 ip address:

Hoku_R2:~# traceroute yahoo.com
traceroute to yahoo.com (98.139.183.24), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
  1  172.16.181.1 (172.16.181.1)  34.889 ms  1.059 ms  1.022 ms

ms  67.642 ms <---verizon tower gateway

At position 2 above I would expect to see the ppp0 address:

ppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol
           inet addr:72.10.xxx.xx  P-t-P:66.174.202.132  
Mask:255.255.255.255
           UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1

but no joy.

I believe the filename confusion is a result of difference between
GRUB1 and GRUB2. GRUB2 changed the configuration a bit.  The file you
changed is built automatically from other information.  The warning
you saw was as follows:

  #
  # DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
  #
  # It is automatically generated by grub-mkconfig using templates
  # from /etc/grub.d and settings from /etc/default/grub

Update-grub (or update-grub2) will (I think) look for available
kernels in /boot and build boot options out of them.

I wonder if you might have run out of disk space during an update?

Only have busybox on these devices. Unfortunately -T isn't supported, 
and tcptraceroute isn't installed.

traceroute: invalid option -- T
Options:
         -d      set SO_DEBUG options to socket
         -n      Print hop addresses numerically rather than symbolically
         -r      Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a 
host
         -v      Verbose output
         -m max_ttl      Set the max time-to-live (max number of hops)
         -p port#        Set the base UDP port number used in probes
                 (default is 33434)
         -q nqueries     Set the number of probes per ``ttl'' to nqueries
                 (default is 3)
         -s src_addr     Use the following IP address as the source address
         -t tos  Set the type-of-service in probe packets to the 
following value
                 (default 0)
         -w wait Set the time (in seconds) to wait for a response to a probe
                 (default 3 sec.).

Traceroute won't work because you want the outward facing address on the
gateway device, and traceroute will give you the inward facing
address.

This was discussed a month or so ago.  There are dynamic dns scripts
for asking an external service what your public ip addr looks like.
whatsmyip.org has an API for doing this, though they ask you to be
gentle.  Any machine you have with a publicly accessable interface
could do the same thing.  They'll see router_1's public ipaddr no
matter how often verizon changes it.

Hello,

 : Only have busybox on these devices. Unfortunately -T isn't 
 : supported, and tcptraceroute isn't installed.

Sounds like a very messy all around, but if you are trying to find 
the IP path, consider both your old friend traceroute and maybe the 
little-known 'record-route' IP option which can be returned by ping.

  # -- no name lookups, use the 'record route' option
  #
  ping -nR -- "$IP"

  # -- no name lookups, use ICMP, send 10 packets immediately
  #
  traceroute -nIN 10 -- "$IP"

Good luck,

-Martin

Nice idea but it seems that Verizon blocks the necessary icmp traffic 
for that to work. Looks like I may have to either use an external server 
such as Russell suggests, or write some scripts to grep the IP address 
out of ifconfig and send a message with that info over to the downstream 
routers. They have password-protected embedded web servers (can't 
control the passwords) but I can probably figure out how to stick the IP 
info into one of the server error pages. Not the end of the world.

Thanks,

Tom S.

I don't know where to configure this permanently, but you should be
able to turn off NOARP with
ifconfig ppp0 arp

I'm a little concerned that may piss off Verizon or have some funky 
side-effect on the ppp connection. Any way to have the arp flag work 
inward only?

Yes, I don't think my idea would help anyway, because router_2 is
seeing the internal side of router_1, not the ppp side. I think you
have to run something on router_2 that sends a message out when the IP
address changes. Probably there are some ifup scripts that run when
ppp0 changes that you could use to trigger the action.

   This seems to be a fad with telcos. Frontier Communications (who bought
Verizon's land-line business) changes my IP address almost every night. Last
night, 21 times, but I've seen as many as 38 changes between 11:00pm and
6:30am the following morning. Makes absolutely no sense to me.

   My solution probably won't work for you.

Does Router_1 have a resolvable DNS name such as:
ae-4-0-ar03.troutdale.or.bverton.comcast.net (68.85.243.253) ?

If so, a simple ping of the DNS name will return a the newly changed ip
address. Then compare that ip addr to the old ip addr and update router2
accordingly.

Also, do you have command line access of Router_1 ?

If so, you could run the command below in combination with a ping script.
So that you ping the existing ip addr at a specified interval, the ping
fails 3 times in a row you export the new ip addr and the update downstream
routers accordingly.

export VARIABLE=`ifconfig ppp0 | grep "inet addr" | awk '{ print $2 }'
| awk 'BEGIN { FS=":" } { print $2 }'`

   The journey has been completed. Built a 3.2.7 kernel with an initrd and
the system now has the correct atl1c module for the Atheros Communications

   I'm far from competent with /etc/sudoers syntax.

   I have a simple, one-line script in /home/<user>/shell-scripts/homenet.sh
that I want to have run with root privileges (because it copies
/etc/resolv.conf.home to /etc/resolv.conf).

   With this line in /etc/sudoers

%users = ALL=(root) NOPASSWD /home/<user>/shell-scripts/homenet.sh

the command, 'shell-scripts/homenet.sh', tells me permission is denied to
create the file. With no entry in /etc/sudoers but running the comand
following 'sudo ' I'm told that the user is not allowed to execute the
script as root on that host.

   Please educate me in the proper syntax for /etc/sudoers so a user can run
a shell script as root.

TIA,

Ken,

   Let me be very specific. In /home/pamela/shell-scripts is the file
homenet.sh. That file has one line: 'cp /etc/resolv.conf.home
/etc/resolv.conf'. What I want is to add a line to /home/pamela/.bash_logout
that runs the shell script. Or, more simply, put the one liner in her
~/.bash_logout.

   Copying the file in /etc requires root privileges and she does not have
root permissions.

   I assume that for the command to run in her ~/.bash_logout an entry in
/etc/sudoers must be made. However, despite how many times I read the sudo
man page and web pages with examples of the sudoers file I still don't grok
what that line in /etc/sudoers needs to be so a user can copy one file to
another in /etc.

Confused,

Rich

I doubt your busybox ping supports it, but ping -R yahoo.com  returns
the external ip address of the router where traceroute does not.  This
is ping from the iputils package where -R gets ping to return the
route it follows. This of course might not work on your ppp0
interface.

I hope I'm not confused...

If I understand your problem, and sudo, my solution would be to configure
sudo so that Pam could run only homenet.sh .

Pam would then type "sudo homenet.sh", and enter her password, and the
shell script could run as root.  If Pam entered sudo anything else, sudo
would give her an error.

Hope this helps..

How can I change the "tee" command so that it stops buffering and displays
the immediate results?

Or is this better done by the "tail -f" command?

I wish there was an option to tee so that the user could see things
happening right away, rather than wait for a 4K or some size buffer to fill
up, which might take hours, in some cases.

Any ideas?

Are you saying it's buffering what you see in your terminal, or what's
written to the file, or both?

I can't recall really seeing it buffer like that but maybe I'm just not
paying close enough attention. It's always seemed pretty real time to me.

Can you post an example of a command line where you'd see this happening?

Generally for things like moinitoring log output in real time, I'll use
tail -f and pipe that through other commands like grep if I need to.

I'll use tee for something like running a script, where I want to see
stdout but also have it captured to a file I can refer to later.

Hello,

 : How can I change the "tee" command so that it stops buffering and 
 : displays the immediate results?

Is something upstream of your tee command buffering?  Are you 
feeding your tee with the output of a grep?  Why do I ask?

Try this:

  { while : ; do date --rfc-822 && sleep 3 ; done ; } \
    | tee outfile

I do not see tee buffering anything.

If I stick an fgrep in there, I get some buffering (by grep):

  { while : ; do date --rfc-822 && sleep 3 ; done ; } \
    | fgrep 'Mar' \
    | tee outfile

What is writing to the input pipe of tee?  Is that program checking 
to see if it is connected to a terminal and behaving differently 
when not connected to a terminal?  Is this grep?  If it is grep, how 
about throwing the --line-buffered option?

  { while : ; do date --rfc-822 && sleep 3 ; done ; } \
    | fgrep --line-buffered 'Mar' \
    | tee outfile

 : Or is this better done by the "tail -f" command?

Depends on what you are trying to accomplish.  You don't show the 
command.  You explain what you expect to see, but given what you 
have said so far, we can only guess that you are calling the program 
tee and not getting the results you want.

 : I wish there was an option to tee so that the user could see 
 : things happening right away, rather than wait for a 4K or some 
 : size buffer to fill up, which might take hours, in some cases.

Ah, yes, precious old 4k PIPE_BUF.

  getconf -a  | fgrep PIPE_BUF
  PIPE_BUF                           4096
  _POSIX_PIPE_BUF                    4096

I'll ask again:  are you certain that tee is buffering?

I will admit to always having some bufferin with tea, though.  
Let's try T for a change of pace.

Have a good evening,

Okay, I confess that I didn't include enough information on the input into
"tee"

I will have to locate the specific sequence of commands, but as one reader
asked if the output was from a grep, it might have been.

Thanks for prodding me.

   This is correct. My question, not answered by my reading of the
sudo/sudoers man pages and Web searches, is what syntax is entered in
/etc/sudoers to allow her to do this. Every attempt of mine has produced an
error.

   More cleanly, I'd like that entry in /etc/sudoers to include NOPASSWD so
the single command, 'sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf.home /etc/resolv.conf' will
work within her ~/.bash_logout. This way, whenever she logs out at a coffee
shop the system is set for use here.

Rich,

I'm not much of an expert myself, but I believe you need to have a
colon at the end of the NOPASSWD tag.

%users = ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /home/<user>/shell-scripts/homenet.sh

I *think* that will do what you want.  I think.

Hope this helps,

   Hmm-m. Could be. I'll try this evening.

   What might also work is

   username hostname NOPASSWD: '/usr/bin/cp /etc/resolv.conf.home
/etc/resolv.conf'

   Again, more trial-and-error this evening.

Thanks, Dale,

If you're interested at all in security, I'd advise strongly against
trying to use SUID to achieve this.  There is a reason, of course,
that the kernel doesn't honor SUID directly on shell scripts. sudo is
a much safer approach, I think.

I recommend you move your homenet.sh script out of the user's home
directory.  After all, that would probably allow them to modify the
contents of the script, which defeats the whole purpose of restricted
root privileges.  It is also possible that sudo has a problem with
this and is trying to prevent you from configuring something
dangerously.  Try putting the script in /usr/local/sbin instead.

As for debugging your sudo config, have you looked at your system
logs to see if sudo is complaining about anything?  Are you using
visudo to edit the file?  I think it's best to use that instead of
editing it directly.

Tim,

   I've no concerns about the user modifying the script; she has
insufficient reason and knowledge to do so.

   What I would prefer is to put the cp command in her ~/.bash_logout file.

   From everything I've read (since I don't use sudo on the machines on which
I work), the only reason for the file saying to use visudo is to protect us
from ourselves. One can put 'Default editor=/usr/bin/<editor_name>' as the
first line in /etc/sudoers and happily use whatever editor you wish. I
initially needed to edit /etc/sudoers with a line found on a Web forum to
allow her to be able to shut down the machine (or reboot) when logging out
of Xfce4. I used joe for that edit; sudo is happy.

Thanks,

The goal of your changes seems really *odd*, to put it lightly.
Changing a system-wide DNS configuration when a single user logs out.
Is your intent to restore the DNS configuration when she is no longer
using the system?  Why not put it in the system shutdown scripts then?
Or better yet, in the system start up scripts (to be overwritten only
when DHCP client is used).  There are probably several other better
options than messing with .bash_logout. If we had a full understanding
what you're trying to accomplish, we might be able to help with that.

Yes, the idea is to prevent you from entering incorrect syntax or
making any number of other mistakes while editing the file.  Someone
else suggested you may have messed up the syntax, so maybe this would
help you.

BTW, if you have a preferred text-mode editor, you should add
something like this to your .bashrc:

export EDITOR=myfavoriteeditor


Then commands like visudo, vipw, svn commit, ... (list goes on) ...
will use that editor by default.

   Now you understand ... almost. I need to have the system-wide DNS
configuration set on that portable for use here. That's neither odd or
strange. I suppose that if one runs all one's LANs using dhcp it's difficult
to appreciate that other networks use static IP addresses.

   All coffee shop wireless access points run DHCP and either blank
/etc/resolv.conf or put in their own list of servers. The problem is that
here the LAN uses static IP addresses, not DHCP, and each host needs the
same /etc/resolv.conf file to access any internal or external host.

   The point of copying /etc/resolv.conf.home to the blank or external
content of /etc/resolv.conf is to allow connection to the local network and
the 'Net from here.

   According to the sudo man page, visudo does not honor the EDITOR or VISUAL
environments from .bash_profile or .bashrc. It needs to be set explicitly as
the first line of /etc/sudoers.

Works for me.  I use zile, which is hardly a popular editor.

Looking at my man page, it says it honors that environment variable if
the editor is in a predefined list.  Maybe Debian has a predefined
list based on installed editors.  Not sure.

It's not at all odd that you want to have this file restored when you
go to a statically assigned network.  What is odd is that you're
updating it automatically from an individual user's script files.

Under Debian and Ubuntu, one can accomplish this kind of update
through /etc/network/interfaces.  You can also use GUIs like wicd to
switch between DHCP network profiles and static network profiles.  Or
you could look into the suggestions I made about system start up/shut
down.  What scripts does your distro run when it enables an ethernet
interface?

All I'm saying is, give us the context and we may be able to suggest
things that both make more sense (from security and usability
prespective) and are less difficult to configure.

   'wicd-client -n' is used when connecting wirelessly with the wlan0
interface. Locally, plugging in the ethernet cable before booting the system
brings up eth0 automatically.

   Restoring the local /etc/resolv.conf from within ~/.bash_logout when
logging out from an external wireless session requires no user knowledge and
does not compromise security of that portable (or the LAN) in any way.
Simple is much better.

This really should be controlled through the networking system.
I recall you're using Slackware.  Does it have /etc/network/.../ifup.* 
scripts?

Presumably when she's at the coffee shop the connection to your home 
network is severed.
So there must be interface up and  down events.  Use those events to 
modify /etc/resolv.conf.

Ken,

   Perfect solution! Didn't occur to me.

   I can have the cp command in /etc/rc.d/rc.local and it will do the job.
Equivalent to doing the copy during logging out, but easier and doesn't
require sudoers editing.

Many thanks,

                                 Brian Martin

Brian has been using native Linux Containers (aka LXC) to solve
a need for increased security and isolation while avoiding the
overhead of virtualization.  In this talk Brian will discuss:

* Where containers surpass virtualization
* What containers cannot do
* Why he selected LXC instead of OpenVZ or similar products

As others have already said, the problem is very likely upstream of the
tee.  I don't think tee adds any additional buffering.

   While looking for an executable file I saw /usr/local/bin/grocery. It's a
binary and no string suggests to me what it does. Running it produces
equally cryptic output:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ grocery
Grocery

   Does anyone have knowledge of what this executable actually does, and can
explain the output? It apparently came here on Nov 8, 2010 and parked its
285K on the shelf.

   Back in 2010, yes. Trying to figure out what it did and whether it would
be of value. Still not sure of the first part, but the second part is 'no.'

Maybe something to do with "gecode"? The output shown here looks similar:

Subject: [PLUG] eee pc bios update
Message-ID: <CAArUT0i3uB7u=22fx8Xqyo8C7vuPWTVAmFbcokcdXTP7-f0_Bg@mail.gmail.com>

I want to perform a bios update on my newly acquired eee pc 1015PEM.  The
only way ASUS specifies is to use a program (AsusUpdate) provided with the
machine, running Windows 7 Starter.  I have not yet removed Win 7, so I can
use that program.  When I use that program to download the bios file, the
most recent version is 0801 10/7/2010. (This is through an FTP site.)
 ASUS's support web site lists a 1301 01/30/2012, and does not list the
0801 version at all.

I can transfer the 1301 version file to the netbook and use AsusUpdate to
update the bios.

i suspect that Asus has just not kept the ftp site up to date, but maybe
there is another explanation.  I do not want to brick the thing.

Once I get the Bios updated, I will scrap the Win 7 and install Ubuntu.

Recommendations?

try this syntax in sudoers file:

Dumb question but you did change permissions on the script to make it

Jen,

   No need: the cp command is in /etc/rc.d/rc.local. :-) Clean and easy.

   Yep. It was the syntax that cause me gas; sudoers complained.

Message-ID: <CAArUT0ihQx_Po0HBi5NX01Tx0Mvmnr=Y1NHoY7mE8Xs_2r3D+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Begin rant.

Wanting to make a live usb of 10.04 LTS, I went to the website (
http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download) and followed the
instructions.  It seemed very well laid out--step-by-step instructions.
 Then I got to a line where it said  "2. open the dash and ..."  WTF is the
dash?  Come to realize that it may be a new creation (name) introduced with
Unity.  How likely is it that I would have or even know of dash if I am
working on 10.04?

The real frustration is that I could not find a reasonable place to make a
comment.  I guess if a comment location were easily visible they would be
overloaded with stupid users ranting.

End rant.

That is the Debian version of the Bash shell, I believe.  You should
be able to simply open a terminal (shell) window and got with whatever
the instructions are.

Try the following:
* On the web:  <http://ubuntuforums.org/>
* On IRC:  #ubuntu on irc.freenode.net
* There is a local ubuntu mailing list as well, I believe.
* And, of course, there's the PLUG mailing list.  :-)

The #ubuntu channel seemed to be quite busy when I checked just now.

Anyway, I hope this helps.  If not, remember, it's worth every penny
you paid for it!  :-)

dash in this case is the Unity equivalent of System/administration, an
entry into a GUI which has Startup Disk Creator as a launch button.

Do not accuse me of that. The only thing I know about it is what I read in
the papers.

The web instructions for making a USB startup disk said at one point "open
dash and...", so I had to ask Dr. Google WTF is dash?  That is when I found
out that it is part of Unity.  That the document writers thought it was
appropriate to assume that someone looking to download 10.04LTS would know
what dash is was the reason for my rant.

What is the desktop you are using now?

Xfce on my Fedora laptop, Gnome 2.30 on Lucid desktop. 

I stuck with Fedora 14 on the laptop as long as I could, knowing that I
would not like Gnome 3 (tried it with live CDs). When I had to upgrade
to Fedora 16 I installed Xfce first and got it all configured the way I
wanted it. I still have Gnome 3 on Fedora 16, but I have yet to log in
to it. 

I have also seen Unity via live CD and I don't care much for it. In
another month Precise will be out to replace Lucid on the desktop. I'm
debating what to do. The desktop is used only for streaming radio,
playing videos, and as a backup to get on the net when I mess up the
laptop. It has no data and little in the way of programs and
configurations. I think I'm going to wipe it out and install Precise
Xubuntu. Or maybe I'll go to Mint, if I can find a recent LTS version
with an Xfce spin, since I need audio and video support. But Mint has
an ugly, stupid logo and I don't want to have to stare at puke green.
It's hard to choose these days, because I have to satisfy the highly
opinionated artist living inside me.

Some thoughts on the Unity/Gnome 3 change

I migrated to Ubuntu Linux about 6 years ago after being alienated by 
the total mess that Windows XP/Vista had become. The Gnome2 desktop was 
easy to master, not all that dissimilar from Windows. Then Ubuntu 
introduced Unity about the same time that Gnome3 superseded the old 
linear menus. I really disliked the new interface models at first and 
wondered why Linux developers just couldn't stick with the old tried and 
true.

A year of so later, my perspective has changed completely. I'm currently 
using Ubuntu 11.10 w/Gnome 3.2 and the Avant dock. After getting used to 
the change I'd never go back (although Ubuntu 11.10 offers the option of 
the "classic Gnome" desktop). The incredible flexibility of lenses 
combined with the traditional linear menus and launchers in Avant makes 
just about every task easier faster and more fun.

My advice to those who find Linux' general move away from the old 
Gnome/Windows menu model uncomfortable is to just slowly acclimatize 
oneself to them. The fully user-customizable Avant dock (AWN) is a great 
tool to ease that transition as it offers everything the old Gnome2 
menus did and more. Gnome2 fans can explore the new paradigm without 
being lashed to it for every task. I suspect most users will eventually 
find themselves more comfortable with Unity or Gnome3 and many will 
become happy fans.

It would really surprise me if you could not change the color, maybe even
the logo.

I do not doubt it, but if it were universally true, we would all be singing

#ubuntu is only for general ubuntu support if you needed instructions 
you could join there on freenode however if you wanted to provide 
feedback #ubuntu-doc would be the appropriate place for such.

12.04 will be the shipping LTS next month so all documentation is being
transitioned to reflect that Ubuntu uses Unity. You can complain all day 
long about Ubuntu using Unity but in the end anyone who is still
shipping Gnome 2.x is just behind on times since that project is EOL 
(End of Life).

Going forward you will have a choice of Gnome3/Unity/XFCE/KDE/Insert You 
Fave Here all which run fine on Ubuntu and we generally maintain
community variants of the most popular spins.

Ubuntu is just keeping up with times and times are moving forward 
instead of staying in 1990 :) We call it progress... You call it whatever :P

I think you miss my point.  In my rant I did not complain about the use of
Unity.  My complaint is that the exclusive use of the vocabulary of Unity
shuts out those who have yet to drink the Cool Aid.

The instructions are intended for those nubee's needing hand holding; the
set of instructions I refer to were for those generating the startup disk
from an Ubuntu install, in my case a LTS release, which does not have such
a thing as "dash".  Why should the LTS not be supported in the
documentation?  The "S" in LTS does stand for "support" IMO.  I feel that
the extra parenthetical phrase required to clarify the instructions is not
asking for 1990.

I have a usb stick ready to load ubuntu 11.10 onto a netbook.  Some
comments on the web indicate that the install only works with fat 16 format
on the stick.  That may be old information, but in case of trouble I would
like to know the format of the stick I have.  How do I determine if it is
16 or 32?  It is an msdos file system according to the info displayed in
the file browser gui.

The best GUI for figuring out how your disks are set up is
Palimpsest. Unfortunately, different distros label it variously in the
application menu, and some don't install it at all. If you can't find
it in the launch menu just launch it from the command line as
"palimpsest." If that doesn't work, then "sudo aptitude install
palimpsest," or equivalent if using other than debian package
management. 

Having said that, if you want to make a bootable USB stick, shouldn't
you be burning the ISO image to the stick rather than copying it to the
stick? Wait ... that's what that utility you needed and couldn't get to
because of "dash" and stuph was all about, right? You probably have
that figured out by now. Never mind.

Almost all USB sticks come from the factory formatted FAT32. I would
have said "all," except that my recent acquisition from Fry's was NTFS
(yes, really).

A flip of Kirk's recent rant.

Sometime around 1994 or 1995 I replaced the SCO Unix and Novell Netware
at home with a network of Linux machines. Used them to learn the back
end of all the fundamental services:  firewall, DNS, NTP, SMTP, SNMP ...
Then whenever a problem came up at work that required the skill I knew
more than my coworkers and got to have fun and make money. Bosses liked
this and so did I.

Today I received a call from HR.  The internal transfer I applied for?
We'd like to offer you the job.  

I'm getting to move on to intensely interesting work - fraud detection.
Skills and experience gained through Linux systems were a key factor
in getting the job.  Having a home lab of three physical machines was
a asset in the manager's eyes.  He especially liked the comment "When
learning I need a lab where I can break things."

A small part of the job will be managing an infrastructure of scores
of servers.  A big part will be analyzing traffic, malware samples,
and figuring out fraudsters new techniques so we can continue to block
their efforts.

It's all built on a foundation of skills acquired by running a network
of Linux boxes at home.

My story is quite similar:

As a freshman in college in 1994, I was fresh off an internship with a
SCO unix consulting agency; all of the employees had boats, worked
20-hour or less weeks, and billed fantastic amounts of money for doing
minimal amounts of work.  Banks were happy to pay.  It left an awful
taste in my mouth for what passed as "unix business" in the corporate
world (they wore ties, I had to wear a wig to cover my "interesting"
hairdo) and it left a copy of SCO in my pocket.

I got my first machine capable of running linux that fall.  And that's
all it ever ran (besides some emulated dos and macOS).  While I
pursued a degree in computer science, I consistently learned more
administering my machine and helping friends get linux installed (via
floppy, natch) than I did in my computer science classes.  I am fairly
certain nobody else in the intro-to-CS class had to patch a pascal
compiler written in C to get it to compile on their desktop =).  I got
a job as a work study in a department full of AIX machines and became
manager of their computing services and moved them to linux (including
some firsts on a campus with ~25,000 computers at the time - first
linux cluster, first department to switch entirely to ssh, first
spamassassin installation) during my 6 years on staff.

I always say I learned more on the job than I did in class.  That's
not strictly true--back then I read the kernel mailing list as
individual messages delivered to my mailbox and spent my spare time
hacking on source code I could see, rather than the dust-gathering
copy of SCO I would have had to guess about and purchase even the
tininest updates for.  What is definitely true is that I learned more
from linux than I did from class.  When I finally took the most
intense upper level classes, OS and Architecture, I sailed through
thanks to my familiarity with filesystems and cache/memory management
from years of watching conversations on lkml and reading patches that
people sent.  I learned more about things like the inside of a network
packet, DNS, and Sendmail from running the linux users' group on
campus than I did in the Networks class I later paid to take.

My career has spanned a lot of types of unix--I still consider IRIX to
be quite pleasant and better suited for the kinds of things it tended
to be used for (10 years ago) than linux.  Solaris has its advantages.
 But linux is why I stuck with the field, where I learned most of what
I know, and where I've had the most opportunities to do more than
overcharge for underwork due to knowledge obscurity.

Indeed.  That is what I did, using Startup Disk Creator.  But does that
mean that the question of the format on the usb stick is irrelevant? That
when it is made bootable the original format is gone?  (I am not being
sarcastic here--just ignorant.)

Denis,

   If you used an .iso file and put it on the flash drive (dd or cdrecord)
then the file system is ISO9660; read-only just like a CD-ROM or DVD.

This is very confusing to me.  When I insert the stick that the Startup
Disk Creator wrote, Ubuntu tells me that it is a 4.0 GB file system of type
msdos.  So I assumed that the .iso existed as a file (or folder) on the
stick, but the stick's file system was determined by the format.  What
Startup Disk Creator did was put on the stuff to make it bootable (in
addition to copying the .iso file).

Please correct my thinking.

Denis,

   My understanding is that live disks, bootable distributions, on optical
media (cdrom or dvd) are in iso-9660 format. That may not always be true.

   I had not known of Startup Disk Creator before your message and know
nothing about it. I use cdrecord (usually via xcdrecord, sometimes on the
command line) to write .iso files to removable media as a read-only file
system of type ISO-9660. If the tool you used does something different then
others will need to answer your questions.

   On the other hand, if you can stick the stick in and re-boot the machine
to the OS on the stick, what does the file system matter?

Although I have some CS studies and Linux/Unix admin work background, most
of my formal training and career has
been with Cisco & Nortel Network Engineering.

My first encounters with Unix was with the SUN network management boxes we
used for managing the Nortel Passport
multi-service switches which I later discovered ran on Wind River VXWorks
embedded RTOS.

I learned just enough about SunOS to navigate around in it and do what I
needed to do to get the net mgmt stations up and working.

It wasn't 'til a few years later that I started working with Linux based
network management and troubleshooting tools such as
nagios, ethereal, kismet and nmap that I really began to appreciate their
value to my work.

Since then I've always run Linux at home and have implored companies to
have Linux boxen connected to any network for performance testing, net
mgmt,
and troubleshooting. Although my current skill level as a Linux Admin is at
best at the intermediate level, being able to apply my understanding
of DNS, NTP, SMTP, Net Mgmt. and networking tools has made my work easier
and me more valuable.

I suspect that Creator wiped any existing filesystem and created an
entirely new filesystem.  It warned you about overwriting the contents
of the stick, correct?  It possibly created a new partition table too.
 After that, it probably installed grub or syslinux, copied the iso to
the filesystem, and configured grub or syslinux to boot the iso.

If you poke around in the mounted stick, you'll probably deduce what
Creator did.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux Containers - the MOVIE!
Message-ID: <001401cd0930$68d5ba90$3a812fb0$@martinconsulting.com>

Those of you that attended the PLUG Advanced Topics presentation on Linux
Containers earlier this week know that I wasn't able to give the promised
demo.  To satisfy that need I've recorded a video of the demonstration,
which you can find at http://youtu.be/N7GkNs2wQt4.   

I spent a huge amount of time figuring out how to record that demo.  I tried
the Istanbul and recordmydesktop apps before falling back to ffmpeg.  For
others that might want to create a similar demo, the incantation that works
for me is:

	ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1024x768 -r 30 -i :0.0 -f alsa -ac 2 -i hw:0,0
-sameq -async 4 -map 0,0 -map 1 ~/output.mpeg

The "-map" options are particularly important to keep the audio and video in
sync.  If any ffmpeg gurus can tell me how to improve this, particularly
regarding the audio quality, I'd love to hear about it.

Finally, I converted the mpeg file to AVI for purpose of uploading to
YouTube.  The AVI file looks fine on my PC, but is much poorer quality
(though still readable) when presented by YouTube.  If anyone has tips in
that regards, please pass them on.

Thanks, everyone.  It's Friday afternoon.  Better find some suitable
containers to empty this weekend.

Indeed. Here's a link to some information about creating a bootable
USB stick:

http://forum.mandriva.com/en/viewtopic.php?t=63493

Mandriva distributes a small installer image called all.img that can
be used to install it in just about every way you might imagine,
including over the internet, from a hard disk, and so on. The link
explains steps to create a bootable USB stick and load syslinux and
that all.img file.

I've used this method successfully to load the installer on a USB stick.

To online storage gurus:

I had a request from a mathematician to share some tables concerning some
geometric figures called triangles and tetrahedrons.  The files are almost
2 gigabytes in size.  I cannot enclose such in any email server that I am
aware of (as 1 chunk of data).  Does anyone know of free online storage
that will allow files of this size to be temporarily posted so that the
receiving person can obtain them?

Thanks for your help.

p.s. I did a quick Google search but most could not handle 2 gig file
chunks.

Dropbox allows files that large if you use the desktop application to
upload them.  Their free account gives you 2GB of storage. So if your
file is smaller than 2GB you should be ok. There are probably other
services that allow this also.

I am interested to know what is in the tables that they are 2 gig.
Triangles being fairly simple shapes, I am not sure what I could come
up with about them that would fill so much space.

Record the audio separately and mix them together with a tool like 
kdenlive.
You can also use this tool to do the format conversion for optimal 
results.

Can you use this utility on, say Fedora, to create a bootable USB stick
with, say, Ubuntu?

I ask because my Fedora 16 has such a utility, but if I try anything
other than a current Fedora ISO it pukes it up. It would be nice to
have a generic utility that would make a bootable USB stick of and on
any distro.

   Have you looked to see if xcdrom will see a USB flash drive as a target?

How about 54+ million of them, and they have a special requirement that 
they be primitive Heron triangles?  The 5,4,3 triangle works, because 
the sides are relatively prime to each other.  The 6,5,5 triangle also 
works.  But the 10,8,6 triangle won't work.  Neither do most triangles, 
like the 2,3,4 triangle, since the area of that triangle is not 
rational.  Heron triangles have rational area.

I have used the Ubuntu Startup Disk Creator with non-Ubuntu ISOs to
create bootable systems.  At least, I am pretty sure I have.  Last
time was probably 9 months ago.

Yes, it will happen, although you will have to settle for me with the
same old dehisced eyelids. No surgery yet.

As you may recall, the Linux Clinic suffered a power supply
failure on the regularly scheduled 3rd Sunday.  We had to
donate the Clinic to Free Geek for recycling.

Well, the Clinic is back from recycling, with a new power
supply, and ready to emit distros, advice, bad jokes, coffee,
and snacks to local Linux users.  As always, the clinic will
have wired and wireless internet, keyboards, screens, mice,
and self-styled experts eager to provide well-intended if
slightly bonkers advice.  We are trying to get the experts
recycled, too, but some miracles are beyond even Free Geek.

So bring your Linux machine and get that poorly documented
Linux app working (or at least nagged at).  Bring in your
Windoze desktop or laptop for a Service Pack Linux upgrade. 
Bring in your Mac and watch us learn the differences
between Darwin/BSD and Linux!

This circus returns to the Free Geek big top at 100pm on
Sunday, March 25, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland, three
blocks south of Hawthorne.  No, it ISN'T "Cirque du
Solaris", though we do hope the sun will be shining.

No, xcdroast will not see the USB stick. That is, not automatically. It
might be possible to add it manually. However, I tried /device/sdc1,
which is what mount thought it was, but it didn't work. 

The Fedora live USB creator fails with other than Fedora ISOs because
it does not have the hash string for other ISOs. Apparently they are
hard coded or something.

Linux vs Windows and others

My work and hobbies are a mixture of tech support, tech documentation, 
creative and political opinion writing. Though I started out in tech in 
the 80s' on a Unix System V at PCC Sylvania and my first internship and 
initial employment was in a Unix engineering environment, I migrated to 
Windows/386 for the GUI. For years I was a loyal adherent to NT 4.0 then 
Windows 2000, easily the most stable of their kind at that time. Unix at 
that time seemed so clumsy and overly complex for desktop work. It was 
only after XP and Vista started exhibiting video and driver issues and 
an unacceptable level of security vulnerability that I tried 
Linux/Ubuntu 7.10  'Gutsy Gibbon'.,

It too had a few driver issues (Nvidia) but Ubuntu seemed to be going in 
the opposite direction from Windows, i.e, improving. No more infernally 
intrusive MS anti-piracy routines that made system hardware upgrades a 
nightmare. Linux wasn't on a Microsoft-style crusade to make every piece 
of hardware I owned obsolete by refusing to supply drivers for legacy 
equipment. Two releases later, Intrepid Ibex just worked! Everything! 
All the time! Even my old Adaptec scsi card and the 10 year old HP 
scanner it fed.

Flash forward to 2012, after all the changes and moves to a new desktop 
interface paradigm, I can't even imagine going back to Microsoft. For 
the very very few devices that only offer a Windows app (mostly 
automotive tuning and diagnostic stuff for hotrodders) I've got Wine or 
emulators. No worries hackers will penetrate my online banking or 
investment accounts or peek at my personal data. No fighting with the 
Microsoft gestapo when I change drives or CPU. Unlimited interface 
customization with a plethora of desktop managers themes and apps.

Is Linux perfect? Nothing is. Does Linux meet the varied needs described 
above and then some? Beyond my wildest dreams. Would I use Linux if it 
cost $250 per 4-user license and Windows was free? Probably; it's that 
good.

Oh and one more thing. I've introduced a few newbie users to Linux who 
either balked at Windows' price or just didn't know anything about 
software. For such newbies I've pointed them at either Xubuntu (XFCE)  
Lubuntu (LXDE) or Mepis (KDE) because they seem the most similar to 
traditional Windows. Haven't had one complaint yet, even from senior 
citizens. Linux must be doing something right.

If all else fails, and assuming that your mathematician friend is
using a Unix-y system, you could use the old shar/unshar programs.
Shar divides the big file(s) into lots of little ones, suitable for
email.  Unshar takes the recieved sharchive files and splices them
back together again.  (Shades of Usenet!)  This really is a last
resort, though.  It's tedious, and given that you have over 2 Gig to
send, there will be a lot of little files, but it can work.

You can browse a variety of USB boot solutions at
http://www.pendrivelinux.com/
There are single and multi-boot solutions of many varieties including ones
that can be done from Windows (Horrors!) and Linux.
Most you feed ISOs and they build the solution (including formatting) for
you.

Bookmarked!

I note the above link has instructions for making a USB stick to boot
to DOS. Every once in a while someone here needs to do that in order to
flash a BIOS.

Yes, I've more or less pulled it together to give a talk on how to set up PXE for OS installs. 

And my laptop is ready to serve up a limited number of them - which we'll expand as part of the demo.

There is a small hub/switch and cat 5 avaiable...right?

If you're not Sean Ellefson you missed out on the fun.
Despite a lack of test platform to verify my install
Despite not reading the docs closely enough
It still worked, almost the first time[1]

Sean and I worked together to correct the nits.  He then dived into recreating the
environment in his portable test network. I honed the installation and presentation.
The clinic rumbled around us.

If there is interest I can give an actual talk.

[1] When I set up my server/laptop with a static IP and then hopped onto the Free Geek network
and ran dhclient to get an IP.  It also fetched an eth0 address for itself from itself. 
All the static addressing failed until that was resolved.

Subject: [PLUG] Asus 1015pem running Xfce
Message-ID: <CAArUT0iPViuLkvYhxYd7zNULBtNCadRUQe7aYGfeHiCM=DdS7w@mail.gmail.com>

I installed Ubuntu 11.10.  It comes with Unity.  After some exposure to
Unity (see wireless comments below) I decided that Unity with its huge
icons and slow behavior does not suit a minimalist machine.  I should try
Xfce.  So I downloaded the meta-package xfce4.  I really like it--fast and
does not fill up my small screen with stuff, but some of the function keys
do not do what is intended, the battery state is not available, the power
controls are absent, it does not suspend on closing the lid, and I suspect
there are other things I would find troubling if I continued.

My first question is would starting over with a clean install of Xubuntu
11.10 behave any better?  Is it possible that there is an interaction
between the gnome/unity stuff on the thing causing a problem?  I have done
some googling on xfce-ubuntu but have not found this problem exactly.  I
see in the package manager that xfce4 is listed as "Canonical does not
supply updates for xfce4" yet xubuntu comes from Canonical and xubuntu uses
xfce!  This is confusing.

With Unity, after some considerable effort following the wireless trouble
shooter I got the wireless to work.  I am not sure what fixed it since the
trouble shooting send me on a long path through various checks (lshw,
lsmod, iwconfig).  But it worked after rebooting.  The issue was that it
seemed to be using a driver (Ralink) for a 2800 card; it has a 3090 card.
 My hesitation with starting over with Xubuntu is having to go through all
the wireless hassles again.

Advice welcomed.

   Install the plugins. They're available at the xfce site (and, perhaps, via
Settings on the panel.)

   Nope. See above.

"Its a known bug. You can fix it by getting the package from 12.04 or by
downloading the source and compiling it."

How do I use 12.04 packages?

If you're not already a Dropbox user, keep in mind that *they* store
*your* password in such a way that People With Sufficient Motivation can
easily get to your files.

I recommend Wuala.com instead, where all the encryption happens
client-side, and your stuff in the cloud is always safe.  And yes, they
have 2GB for free as well.

It's also a lot more flexible... instead of a single ~/Dropbox folder,
you can have multiple folders all over your disk with multiple rules for
syncing or backup.

As a user of Android phones I look at Phandroid once a day to see
what's new. A couple weeks ago they announced a new app for Box and, if
you signed up by April 3? you got 50 GB storage for free. I did so, and
now have free storage more than ample for my needs. I can access it
from any computer, as well as from my phone.

I don't know about the file size limit, though. Nor do I know anything
about security. I have to log in with a password, although if I log in
from my phone the login is automatic.

Never mind.  I found the appropriate package which now seems to work.  I
can see the battery charge level and it seems to suspend when I close the
lid.

Another annoyance is that I cannot stop from dragging my fingers across the
touchpad and loosing my work in various mysterious ways.  I found out how
to shut it off while typing, which helps a lot.  I would like the function
key to shut it off, but that is not working, and it seems that it will
continue not to work.  Who knows what 12.04 may bring.

I was at the Clinic, but working on other matters, so I would like to

I had the same problem. I solved it by turning off the touchpad in the
BIOS. Of course, that made an external mouse a requirement, but a
regular mouse is vastly better than a touchpad anyway. Right now I am
using a $15 Dynex USB mouse from Best Buy. Its receiver stick is only
about a centimeter long, so I don't risk breaking it off so much.

I don't know if you got this sorted out at the clinic or not, but
the file to adjust for this is /etc/default/grub, specifically the
GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET and GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT settings. If you wish
to see the menu, comment those lines out and adjust the GRUB_TIMEOUT
setting to be how many seconds you wish it to show the menu before
booting into the default. For example, I routinely set my config like so

  #GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0
  #GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true
  GRUB_TIMEOUT=10

to get the menu displayed for 10 seconds before booting into the default
kernel.

Once you're done editing /etc/default/grub, you'll need to run
update-grub as root (e.g. via sudo) for configuration files in
/boot/grub to be regenerated.

The way the boot setup is supposed to work with grub2, you should
also be able to hold the Shift key down when booting to get the grub
menu to display when grub is configured to not show it by default.

You can find more information on the settings available in
/etc/default/grub at

  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#A.2BAC8-etc.2BAC8-default.2BAC8-grub_.28file.29

or by running

  info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'

May I suggest using Unetbootin (http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/), zap
your USB to FAT using fdisk as that for me seemed to work best and then
download your .iso and open up Unetbootin and burn the iso to the USB
stick, it will do all the work for you.  I have successfully used this for
Mint, Suse, Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu OS on a stick builds.  but if this
rant is more about lack of documentation then forgive me and please

I have never had reliably good luck installing XFCE LXDE or KDE on top 
of the basic Gnome or Unity Ubuntu. Going all the way back to at least 
Ubuntu 9.04  KDE in particular seems to corrupt something in Gnome fonts 
while its own fonts are clearly screwed up versus a Kubuntu Mint or 
Mepis KDE install. Try Xubuntu or Lubuntu. My favorite would be Lubuntu, 
specifying the LXDE shell versus the other choices at login.

Thanks Steve,
Nope didn't make it to the clinic and no I had not figured out just how
simple this part of the fix was. My grub cfg has been tweaked and tested.
Yea so next time this happens ( optimistic aren't I ) it should be much
easier to recover from.

The rant was about the documentation, but the thread has morphed into a
discussion of how to write a bootable usb stick, so your post fits in
nicely.  In my case I was not moving from one distribution to another
(remaining in Ubuntu), so for me the universality of Unetbootin that you
mention was not needed.  However, John may find it useful, as he is a
distribution explorer.

I just got around to installing Unetbootin. Cool little app! I didn't
actually use it to create a bootable USB stick yet, but it sure looked
capable of creating anything I might ever want. Thanks for the tip!

	large files
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHdSkNa07ZOX27vzhwm=ki15MASwezuQvr1A=qWe7YUzNA@mail.gmail.com>

Is the odd behavior of the "cp" command which I have observed normal?

I have a large partition (call it /large) set up which is about 3
terabytes in size.

When I copy a 24 gigabyte file in that partition to another file in
the same partition, I notice that system memory starts to get used up.
 In fact almost all of the 24.733 gigabytes of memory is eventually
used, with only 500 meg or less left for system use.

This has made normal tasks, like "ls" and "vim" practically unusable,
as very large delays now take place between the time that you type
something into the vim editor and when you see the cursor actually
move or the command execute.

Is this normal for "cp" ???

I am running Linux 2.6.32-39 on an Ubuntu 10.04 system which is very
nearly up to date, as far as software goes.

But I find this odd that "cp" would request 24 gigabytes+ of system
memory or does it want the same amount of memory as the file size?

How much memory does your system have?  If it's not being otherwise
used, it might grab that much for disk cache, but it will be reclaimed
when needed and shouldn't cause spilling to the swap partition.

How much swap is in use when this happens?  If it doesn't go up then
it's just normal disk caching using otherwise unused memory. If it
does go up then there may be a problem.

{How much memory does your system have?}

24.7 gigabytes and almost all but 88 megabytes has been grabbed.

{If it's not being otherwise used, it might grab that much for disk
cache, but it will be reclaimed
when needed and shouldn't cause spilling to the swap partition.}

Unfortunately now the normal rate of doing tasks, like listing a
directory or editing a file have all but stopped.

{How much swap is in use when this happens?}

92k so obviously almost no swap is involved.

{If it doesn't go up then it's just normal disk caching using
otherwise unused memory. If it
does go up then there may be a problem.}

Unfortunately grabbing almost all the system memory just to do a disk
cache for copying a 24 gig file has just about left the system
useless.

Should not the command at least leave about 1 gig of memory alone?  I
do confess to having a 16 processor system.

I have abandoned doing normal tasks for now, while these 24 gig files
copy, but this is a heads up for those who might try such large size
file copying.

This is very odd.  Can you try pausing the cp process temporarily (^Z)
to see if your system becomes more responsive?  If it does, then it
could be that it is really an I/O issue.

Are you connecting to this system remotely?  Are you copying to/from a
network drive?

There's a possibility that cp or a library it depends on has a memory
leak, but I would find this unusual.


An alternative way to copy large files would be to use dd.  I often

{ This is very odd.  Can you try pausing the cp process temporarily (^Z)
to see if your system becomes more responsive? }

I did so, and I was able to regain control and normal execution rate of my
commands almost instantly.

{ If it does, then it could be that it is really an I/O issue.}

Unfortunately I could NOT restart that job even though I knew the pid.

{ Are you connecting to this system remotely?  Are you copying to/from a
network drive? }

The drive is a SATA drive which plugs into the motherboard via a SATA
backplane.  This is an expensive Supermicro 7046GT-TRF motherboard.

{ There's a possibility that cp or a library it depends on has a memory
leak, but I would find this unusual.}

Unfortunately after killing the job and then killing the shell script that
was running the cp commands, "top" shows

top - 20:04:44 up  2:04,  4 users,  load average: 0.33, 1.75, 3.05
Mem:  24733672k total, 24447148k used,   286524k free,   314712k buffers

  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
--------------------------------------------------------------------

So there is no load on the system, but almost all the memory got taken away
and it is not being returned as one would expect.

I am not sure what to think, but for my motherboard and version of linux,
there definitely appears to be a problem with the "cp" executable.

However there are more important things to tackle than this, but it was so
odd that I decided to post about it.  Enough said.

Hmm, not even with 'fg' ?

And you were copying to and from locations on the same drive?  Or was
there another drive involved?

What filesystem(s) are mounted at these (source and destination)
locations?  (ext3? ext4? other?)

If cp and the associated shell are truly dead, then it sounds like
this could be a kernel bug.  Perhaps in a filesystem driver.  With
more information, we may be able to help you track down known bugs
associated with these.

This looks 100% normal.  Notice the "22884668k cached" entry.
This is memory allocated to disk caching but will be released
(WITHOUT writing it to the swapfile) as needed.  In effect it's
free memory, but the system knows it has disk blocks in it
(and which ones) so if you were to happen to read one of those
blocks again it wouldn't have to go a disk I/O.  For all other
intents and purposes, it's free memory.

It sounds from your description like the problem is I/O and
has nothing to do with memory.  If it were memory, the "swap
used" number would be MUCH larger.  No swapping is happening
on your system.

I was copying from the same drive to the same drive in the same

What filesystem(s) are mounted at these (source and destination)

The filesystems were ext3.

Someone else mentioned possible I/O problem.

What is a bit irritating in all this is that cp should NOT have
grabbed so much main memory and allocated it to disk cache.  It took
99.65% of the memory.  I would have expected it to throttle back and
only use 95% of the available memory, insteading of grabbing

Why?
What's lead you to that belief?
What else was the system doing?

It was caching the only significant activity on the system.

Jim is right, I missed what he pointed out about all memory being in
cache.

The use of memory in this case is not your performance issue.  The way
any modern operating system works is that it will use up as much
memory as possible in caching, since accessing disks is several orders
of magnitude slower than accessing memory.  After all, if you're not
using the memory for anything else, why not cache recently used disk
blocks for efficiency's sake?

The key thing to note here is that *if* you needed that memory for
something more important, like launching a new process, then the
kernel would immediately yield the cache to you for that purpose with
no performance penalty.


As for the I/O explanation, part of the reason your system became so
slow is that your hard drive's head is thrashing.  You are copying
data from one part of the disk to another, which means the disk has to
seek to one region of the disk, read the information, then seek to
another region to write it.  This back-and-forth seeking is a huge
performance killer.  Add on top of that the fact that you are trying
to use the system, causing additional processes to read/write other
regions of disk, so that just exacerbates the seek issue.  Modern
magnetic hard drives just do not do well with operation in parallel.
For more parallel performance, people either turn to RAID (each disk
is another channel for parallel operation) or SSD (no seek penalty).

HTH,

As I understand it, cp has no memory management capabilities. The memory management is handled at the kernel level.

as for other commands taking more time to run, this could be explained by
those commands waiting for access to the disk while the cp command is
taking up most of the IO capacity. this would not necessarily be a result
of too little memory available.

this problem could be compounded if your swap is set up on the same device
as /large.

this is not how the cache is supposed to work - the memory is not reserved
for the cache, it is just used until something else needs it. it is then
immediately freed for the new use, and allocated to that. ls or vim or
anything else will never notice a lack of available memory if it is taken
by disk cache.

in linux, individual applications (including cp) do not have a sense of how
much memory they have used or is remaining available on the system. this is
handled by the OS. they just request the memory they need until a request
is denied (or its need is completed). how the application handles the
denial is up to the app - it could crash, or it could work with what it
has, and then re-use what it has allocated. this ecosystem of handling
needs works pretty well overall.

If you are doing the "cp" as root, that takes priority over user
commands.  Try lowering the priority with "nice".  If the process
is already running, try using "renice".  As far as the kernel
knows, moving this big file is very urgent;  tell it otherwise.

There is also a command called "ionice", but I haven't used it. 
If you are moving files over the network, or you are copying a
big file onto an older-but-nearly-identical file, use the rsync
command with --bwlimit

Linux has lots of tweaks for moving big data and tuning systems.
However, it cannot guess what is important to you, and out of 
the box, it is tuned for getting big jobs done fast.

   I don't understand enough about networking to figure out the source of the

has name servers identified and both ping and traceroute fail when fed IP

   What might be the problem here, where there's an IP address issued by the

NealS,

   The gateway and netmask are set by the DHCP server when it assigns an IP
address to the host. I don't recall what they were. On the ethernet here
everything's on static IP addresses and works flawlessly.

has name servers identified and both ping and traceroute fail when fed IP
addresses, too.

   What might be the problem here, where there's an IP address issued by the
DHCP server in response to a dhcpcd request by wicd, nameservers are
assigned, but there's no ability to connect to a Web server or anywhere
else?

Thouroughly confused,

Rich

Rich,

The point of my question was to verify that a default gateway was set
properly on the WLAN. That is, the default WLAN gateway was set to a
valid address on the WLAN subnet. If it's not you won't be able to
access any IP (including DNS) that's not on the WLAN subnet.

I think eduncliffe is on the right track about something you're
running on firefox blocking the redirect to get logged in/fully
connected through the wireless provider.

NealS

Just a heads-up, NoCatAuth (which I believe FreeGeek is using)
typically won't let you use your own nameservers because all your
traffic (with specific exceptions) is blocked until you accept the
conditions.  In those cases, the network is expecting you to use its
DHCP supplied nameserver(s).  I'm going to guess (necessary since you
don't provide enough information) that your machine is not accepting
the DHCP provided nameserver(s), but using your own overrides (8.8.8.8
is one of google's public DNS servers).

I don't actually know how FreeGeek is configured.

Neal,

   I did see the gateway IP address in one of the files when I was at the
coffee shop.

   Interesting. Could be, I suppose. I can try links or lynx and see what
happens. I'll also bring my Dell (which works wirelessly and is also running
13.37/x86_64 and firefox 11.0).

   Probably tomorrow.

Thanks,

Rich

   At both Free Geek and the coffee shop this morning /etc/resolv.conf was
set by the local DHCP servers and showed the IP addresses for the two
nameservers they provided. I wrote that this was the case; the coffee shop
provided 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 that's why I used them. I am _not_ using the
default resolv.conf that's set up for ethernet on the LAN, but whatever
resolv.conf is set by the wifi servers at the two locales.

Subject: [PLUG] freewrl .deb dependency error
Message-ID: <4F7789D1.6000105@comcast.net>

Once in awhile I have some time to experiment. Today I'm trying to 
install freewrl on my Ubuntu 10.04 machine. I have a .deb file 
(freewrl_1.22.101_i386) which I got from:

http://download.tuxfamily.org/myosotis/freewrl/package/lenny/i386/

When I try to install it I get an error message:

Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libmozjsld (>= 1.9~b4)

Googling this provide plenty of information, none of which makes much 
sense to me.

Ultimately I'm trying to come up with a way to fool around with VRML and 
X3D. If someone has found a way to do that on Ubuntu I'd be pleased to 
hear about it.

Thanks.

> Rich - From your description of the behavior you're experiencing, I offer
the following explanation.

It seems you're having problems with wifi AP captive portals. The reason
you're having a problem with
that is that you need the *internal* DNS servers that the DHCP server hands
out to get name resolution
for the internal web server that provides the captive portal web page to
your browser for you to accept the terms
& conditions and be authorized on the wireless network before you can get
connectivity to the internet and your static DNS servers.

You *public* DNS servers cannot resolve the netbeans.com domain/url because
it has an *internal / private* ip address. It is unknown
on the public internet.

What I've done in the past to get around this, is to let the DHCP servers
overwrite my /etc/resolv.conf file. Once I get connected on the wlan and
have internet connectivity, I copy /etc/resolv.bak which has my preferred
public DNS servers over /etc/resolv.conf.
