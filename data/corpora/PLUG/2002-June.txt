Um, no it's not intended to replace the NIC.

Here's a nice example of it's usefulness I did in a previous life (old
timer) while administering a bunch of UNIX servers.

I connected the serial console port of each server to a terminal server,
which is accessible via a remote access server (dial-in, reverse telnet).
Then when my pager goes nuts while I'm at the beach (or a ball game or
whatever) because one of the servers crashed and needs a manual fsck or
something else requiring console access, I connect my PDA to my cell phone
or an analog line, dial in and fix the problem with minimal disruption to
the activity at hand.

Of course, you could also hang a modem directly on the serial port, but then
you would have to dial in even when you're in the office, or swap the modem
our for a VT100 terminal.

Either way, copious security measures are in order when hanging your servers
off of the public telephone network...

No, actually I'm talking about a full suspend-to-disk "Hibernate":

As much as I can join the ranks and diss Windows XP (and there are MANY,
many, reasons to do so, I'm sure we can all agree there)....one very
nice feature is a full hibernate to disk followed by a power off - the
batteries are not drained at all.  When the OS is powered back up, it
resumes where it left off.  This works very well - I only find I have
issues with media playback.  Lengthy DivX threads, etc. will keep going.


This is also nice when I want to leave everything as-is and then reboot
to RedHat 7.3 (dual boot).  Because GRUB is pulled up first, I can
select RH7.3, play around, then shutdown and reboot come back to GRUB,
where I then Select Windows XP and whammo - Windows resumes.

The laptop is a IBM A30 - P3 1ghz, though my fiance's p2-300 does it
well too.

Clearly, anyone who has ever lived as a dual-booting road warrior can
see the advantage of this ;)  I can shut my box down, pack it, travel to
my next appointment (class, in my case) and whammo - I'm back where I
left off.

It's also plain to see that if someone doesn't need to close all apps in
order to do this in Linux and boot to Win, it would be a lot easier to
use it more as a client.  As a result, I never really get around to
using Linux as a client as much as I'd like to.

I didn't mean to turn this into a pitch for developers to start a
project implement this, but I think the advantages for those who who see
Linux as a "movement" or a "cause" are obvious - breaking down barriers
to usage.  At home, I mostly use VNCserver to access my server box.
This works well, though it's a server, and not generally used as a
workstation - plus I don't like the idea of working as root too much for
obvious reasons (one of the inherrent limitations of vncserver).

I assume by "hibernate" that you mean "suspend" where the computer keeps
everything in ram but shuts down the screen, hard drive, CPU, etc., so
you can quickly power-up and pickup where you left off.  I have done
this successfully on my old laptop, but haven't used the feature with
the latest upgrades or gnome (I don't use this laptop much these days).
As far as what you need, it requires APM (advanced power management) be
compiled into the kernel or a kernel module.  There are also some
options to look at which are specific to some poorly behaved laptops
when you select the APM option.  Aside from the kernel option(s), you
need the program "apmd" which provides the interface to the power
management system and does things like reset the Linux time when the
system powers back up and other power management related stuff.  This
setup worked fine for me using fvwm and ice window managers (never tried
Gnome or KDE).

I'm working from memory of an older configuration, so there may be some
differences with the latest stuff, perhaps someone else on the list has
done this more recently.

Hmm. Where to start...? :-)

Many computers sit in special server rooms or remote locations and run
headless -- without a direct keyboard, monitor, and mouse connection
-- and don't run GUI software on the console. They're plain
command-line interface machines.

Console output isn't sent to a monitor, and input isn't received from
a keyboard; it's all done via a serial port. Sometimes that serial 
port is a modem into which you can dial, but most often these days the 
other end of the serial connection is what's known as a terminal 
server: a computer or appliance with a ton of serial ports.

Obviously, most administration on a server like this is done via 
ethernet. But what happens when you want to replumb the network 
interface, install a new kernel, or go into single-user mode? At that 
point, the ethernet interface will fail you.

So you log into the terminal server (not to be confused with the 
Windows product of the same name) and ask for a console session to the 
host in question. Then you can do any task that would typically 
require a direct keyboard/monitor connection.

Some x86 BIOS implementations even allow you to redirect BIOS-level
output to a serial port, or you can fake it with a product like PC 
Weasel (www.realweasel.com). That way, you can even configure your 
Adaptec card or re-do BIOS settings without being anywhere near the 
computer. I understand that Itanium-class machines have this 
capability natively.

Of course, Intel is a Johnny-come-lately to the server party. Suns, 
Alphas, and other architectures have been fully administerable via 
serial consoles for decades.

This provides remote managment.  Combined with a terminal server you can get 
direct console access from anywhere on your network.  

Also if you have a rack of 1U units replacing all the KVM cables with serial
cables eases the physical management of the boxes.  Small gain, but useful.

Yes, it's being modified heavily in 2.5.x.
It's currently a combo of ACPI and "software suspend" patches.
These have made a lot of progress in recent months, but are
still very much "development level" patches.
If you want to try them out, that's fine, of course;
just backup your important stuff first.
And you should provide feedback to the acpi-devel
mailing list (see acpi.sf.net).
Just don't expect it to be perfect yet.
There are lots of interrupt routing issues and lots
of buggy ACPI byte-code issues (in BIOS).
Power button doesn't work for some people, does for others, e.g.

Another iptables tip:

Consider adding two chains to your installation called log-accept and log-deny
like:

    iptables -N log-accept
    iptables -A log-accept -j LOG --log-prefix "FIREWALL-ID-ACCEPT: " --log-level 6
    iptables -A log-accept -j ACCEPT
    iptables -N log-deny
    iptables -A log-deny -j LOG --log-prefix "FIREWALL-ID-DENY: " --log-level 6
    iptables -A log-deny -j DROP

Followup with replacing all '-j ACCEPT' and '-j DENY' with '-j log-accept' and 
'-j log-deny'

Then  `grep ACCEPT: | <one of Paul's scripts | other usefule script>` and check 
for unexpected traffic from a misplaced or misformed rule.  Or `grep DENY | ...` 
to search for traffic inadvertently being dropped.

In a business setting this will also allow you to quickly and authoritatively 
determine if someone's Internet problem is firewall related.  Not that anyone
every blames the network for a machine configuration error or other problem. :)

It's nice that APC includes the signaling cable with the 500VA units 
now. I purchased one of these units a few years back and I had to make 
my own cable since APC wanted something like $40.00 for a signaling 
cable. I built two signaling cables with $0.99 worth of parts from a 
second-hand electronic parts store using the Linux UPS HOWTO. I also 
rolled my own monitoring software using the example "backupsd" 
monitoring daemon from the HOWTO as well. 

I did purchase a SmartUPS 700 last year for a system and it included 
both the cable and a PowerChute software CD that had a version for 
Linux among other supported operating systems.

Any of R. Schwartz's books would help a great deal....Learning Perl got me 
going a few years ago....If you're looking for specific things, a search on 
sourceforge.net for projects will give you a bunch of code to learn from.

Are you trying anything in particular? or just getting a base level of 
knowledge of perl down?

Also check out CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) cpan.org.  They have 
countless perl modules and a few scripts....

for CGI stuff, a good learning resource may be Matt's Script archive 
worldwidemart.com/scripts/  I wouldn't necessarily use the exact scripts from 
the site (personal conviction) but they may offer insight into any CGI stuff 
you may want to do....also....If Perl is correctly installed on your system, 
you should have a handy-dandy little program called 'perldoc' which is like a 
'man' system for Perl...say you wanted to learn about the IO::Socket module:
simply type perldoc IO::Socket.....(usually works as 'man IO::Socket' too but 
that wouldn't be a very Perl-ish way of doing things.  It also depends on 
your $MANPATH)

If I can help with any specific items....let me know...

Hope this helps

Matt's Script Archive is a good resource for those who want to find out 
what not to do.  Most of them are rather buggy and full of security 
holes.  http://www.perlmonks.org has good pointers with CGI and other stuff.

http://www.easystreet.com/~ovid/cgi_course is a good beginning for CGI.

I believe so, although I haven't tested it yet (I plan on trying the same
thing when I get back to work on Monday).

Add this line to your smb.conf:
add user script = /usr/sbin/useradd -s /bin/false %u

If the effort is worth it, you may want to try a
chemical rubber restorer called Fedron.  It expands
the rubber for a better grip.  Our copier repair guy
use to use it on our old copier rollers and it did
wonders (at least for a while).

Last resort, if you are ready to give up and toss the
printer - 

read somewhere about cleaning the rollers with WD40
and supposedly gave the rollers more grip

or

very lightly sanding the rollers with sand paper to
give the rollers better grip.

Showing my stubborn streak, I decided to give it one more try today.  I
figured out how to pull the entire pickup assembly out of the printer.
I then removed the 'D'-shaped rubber bands.  I sanded them with 220 grit
and then cleaned them with rubber conditioner.  When I reinstalled the
bands, I rotated them 180 degrees.  I figured the rotation might help
by putting rubber that wasn't quite as worn up at the initial pickup point.
After reassembling the printer, I was able to print a 40 page document
without problems.  No doubt it will fail again in the future, but at 
least I've kept it out of the waste stream for a little while longer.

For what it's worth, as far as I can tell "hibernate" works well for me
on my 2.4.18-6mdk kernel on my Sony Z505, it even picks up the
Fn-hibernate keypress.  As I use it *ALL* the time, is there some
drawback to what mandrake is doing vs. the latest/greatest dev kernel?

You misunderstand. I'll break it down for you.

Facts:

1. He did not say that he wants to learn Perl.

2. He did not say that Perl is a requirement.

3. He did not say that he is aware of alternatives.

4. He did say that he finds Perl difficult.

5. Python is often a viable alternative to Perl.

6. The web site for Python is http://www.python.org/

Opinions:

1. Python is easier to learn than Perl.

2. Short, informative posts are best.

Get it?

In my own experience, the following have been the most helpful:
the llama book
the camel book
the perl manpages
The Perl Cookbook (forget what animal is on that one)
looking at the structure of modules on CPAN
www.perlmonks.org
comp.lang.perl.* newsgroups

these are arranged in more-or-less chronological order; that is, I started
with the llama book, then moved on to the camel book, etc.  I think I'm
pretty familiar with the language now, and 90% of the time I'll use the
man pages for reference.

What is it you're trying to do?  Pick up a new language, maintain someone
else's existing code, fix a specific problem?  What other languages are
you familiar with?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206020900360.23525-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I've installed several libraries from tarballs because these libraries are
required by packages I've installed. Because the libraries were not
installed from a package, the rpm database is unaware of their existence and
reports that they are missing when I try to install a different application
that requires them. Is there a way to make the package database aware that
these libraries are installed?

  Seems to me that the only difference between the Update and Freshen
options is that the former will install a package if it's not already
present. Are there any other differences?

Thanks,

Rich

Only if they are installed via rpm.  For packages that are reluctant to 
install due to dependency issues, check out the 'force' and 'nodeps' 
options with rpm.  Alternatively to the 'compile tarball' route,  use some 
non-official rpm choices.

		www.freshrpms.net
		www.bero.org
		www.rpmfind.net
		
And www.freshmeat.net houses a significant number of software projects any 
more, many with links to pre-built rpm packages.  Then, of course, there 
is always getting down and dirty with generating your own rpms.  
www.rpm.org is a place to start.

I'd like to confirm a few things that I think are true:

1. The maximum file and volume sizes are the same for both
ext2 and ext3.

2. The 2 GB file size limit is a library limitation - not a limitation
of the file system or the kernel.

The Llama book - Learning Perl - commit a weekend to doing the whole book.  
Do every single exercise.  EVERY single one.  That was the foundation that
my Perl is built on.  

Check the PLUG archives for Paul Heinlein scripts.  Unlike what you'll find 
on CPAN they are small enough for you to grok the entire thing and learn from it.

Compare Matt's scripts (suggested elsewhere) with NMS (Not Matt's Scripts) both
sets have good levels of comments and the contrast of doing the same task as
implemented by two different programmers is more helpful than figuring out
what one person did.  

Magazine columns - because they tend to be very focused and explain the how of 
what they do.  Randal Schwartz posted a link to his stuff.

Port anything you have from a different language.  DOS batch files, Paul 
Heinlein's sh scripts, the AWK thing you wrote a year ago.  Porting something
you've done in a different language is very instructive and narrows the problem
set to just figuring out how to implement a solution in the new language.

  I have been using '--nodeps' once I check that the required libs are
present. I just wondered if there's a way of making the rpm db aware of a
non-rpm-installed library. You confirmed that the answer is, "no".

Hibernate using APM or ACPI?
APM often works if the BIOS isn't buggy.
But new notebooks (Toshiba, Fujitsu, Sony, Compaq, et al) use
ACPI only -- no APM provided.
Same is true about some newer desktop motherboards.
And development of ACPI sleep modes is still work-in-progress.

That's really not true. What you do is write a dummy package that
contains no files, just a bunch of Provides: lines. That's what I did
on my Solaris box to let rpm know what libraries came installed with
the system.

First, you create the .spec file. It'd look something like this:

#
# this is a virtual rpm; it doesn't contain any files, just a list
# of Provides taken from the base solaris os. See the very bottom
# of this .spec for the actual package info...
#

Summary: Manually installed libraries
Name: handbuilt
Version: 1.0
Release: 1
Copyright: GPL
Group: System Environment/Base
Packager: Rich Shepard <>
# these are just examples. season to taste
Provides: lib450.so.1
Provides: libC.so.3
Provides: libC.so.5
Provides: libCrun.so.1
Provides: libCstd.so.1
Provides: libFS.so
Provides: libFS.so.5
Provides: libICE.so
Provides: libICE.so.6

%description
This is a virtual RPM package.  It contains no actual files.  It uses
the `Provides' token from RPM 3.x and later to list many of the shared
libraries I've installed by hand on my system.

%prep
# nothing to do

%build
# nothing to do

%install
# nothing to do

%clean
# nothing to do

%files
# nothing here

#
# eof
#


Then "build" the rpm: "rpm -bb /path/to/foo.spec" -- and install it. 
>From that point forward, rpm is aware of the libraries you've listed 
in the various Provides: lines. Note that you don't need to provide a 
full path to the library, just its basename.

  Wow! What an extremely useful solution!

  This is why I'm not a SysAdmin. But, I'm sure greatful to those of you who

But, Yes, yes, yes, YES and YES.  The world needs examples of what not to do.
contrasting NMS work with MSA work is one path to seeing it.  

Excercise:  read one of Matt's scripts, perhaps formmail.  Figure out what you 
would do differently.  Then review the NMS version for more ideas and insight.

Considering that Matt says "don't use my stuff" and "here are links to the NMS
replacements for my stuff" you get plenty of advice about what path to follow.

Hello Folks,

We're inviting you to a party. Come join us and celebrate Free Software!

http://k12ltsp.org/software_freedom.html

If you're not in Portland then you'll find information on the page above for
hosting your own party. Help LUGs and schools connect in your area!

Schools here in Portland have enjoyed great support from our local Linux
user group PLUG. We wanted to get together with them and say thanks. We're
also hosting the event as an open house for other schools interested in
using Linux. Free software and refreshments for all!!!

The hours are from 10:00 am to 12:00 noon so you'll still have time to enjoy
other traditional July 4th holiday events.

Directions: http://www.riverdale.k12.or.us/direct.html

Keep up with news of other Software Freedom Day celebrations on
http://k12os.org

Paul,

I wish you, Eric and everybody else involved all the best
in your 2nd Freedom day.

I'd love to come out there to Portland for that event, but
I'll be in Bristol, England on the 4th, giving a tutorial
on LTSP for the UKUUG Linux conference.

I think that England is 8 or 9 hours ahead of you guys on
the west coast.  Maybe the timing will work out, and I can
be online with you guys for part of the event.

Thanks, and keep up the great work.

I've got a potential customer with semi-public winboxen.  It's difficult for me

Does anybody have experience with content filters? I could easily put a proxy

What I would do is run squid, 

here is the info you will need, 
http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/FAQ-10.html#ss10.4
http://list.cineca.it/cgi-bin/wa?S2=squid&q=porn+&s=&f=&a=&b=

You can set squid to block via regex /porn/ and host base.

By far squid is your best bet. 

I run squid for my home pc, since I had a dialup, way better speed :) 

cache of dns, web, images, 

You might want to set the porn log to dev null, if you want to skip out
of being the porn police, and getting people fired due to their porn.

To run squid, you need to make sure that there is only squid to the out
side world on your firewall. 

Else the porn seekers, will turn off the proxy settings, and go right to
the INTERNET.   

If you are talking about library, where the regex of /breast/ cancer
would cause issues, then I would have 2 squid caches running.

port 8080: Minor 0-18. with filtering. 
port 9090: No filtering. 

Then have the logon switch the settings in IE/ Netscape what ever. 


Your millage may vary. 

Good luck :)

Filtering is one of my other pet projects, which should come as no shock
considering the number of teenagers I have on my network ;-)

There are two excellent GPL web filters available, squidGuard
(www.squidguard.org) and Dan's Guardian (www.dansguardian.org). Both are
designed to work with the squid cache server that ships with all major
versions of Linux.

I've just started playing around with the latest version of Dan's Guardian,
it has a number of interesting features such as "stateful" inspection of
webpages (i.e. you can filter based on the content within a web page).

I've had squidGuard in heavy production use now for over a year. We're
providing filtering services for over 250,000 students in Oregon and
possibly as high as a million or more nationally/globally. 

SquidGuard is just as effective as the commercial software we used to use,
but it has a much lower "false positive" rate - it blocks fewer sites that
should not be blocked. One we got it tuned to our tastes, our users were
much happier with squidGuard.

The squid FAQ has a section on setting transparent proxying, so that all
web requests are automagically forced through the filter:

I've used Little Brother, the software formally known as Big Brother.  I
think it was since bought by Surf Control and they now call it Super Scout
or something.

Anyway, it worked fairly well.  It didn't catch everything it was supposed
to, but I think that's to be expected with this sort of product.  Porn sites
come and go so quickly that it's pretty hard to completely filter them
unless you go the route of only allowing certain sites.  It does provide
some very good information about who went (or tried to go) where.  You hang
it off of a hub between the users and the internet border router.  It
watches the traffic and logs (and optionally filters) all conversations.  I
liked that it's not actually in the data stream (traffic doesn't have to go
through it to get to the internet), so it's not a potential point of
failure.  You could configure a custom page to be returned to the browser
requesting an inappropriate page.  You can run on a number of platforms
including on a proxy server, on a Checkpoint FW-1, or stand alone on Windoz,
Solaris and Linux.

My only real beef with it was that it's database seemed to crash all the
time.  Of course I had it on a VERY busy link and pretty much ignored the
box until I wanted to run a report which was not very often.  The database
would get very big very fast and when I went to run a report, it would kind
of puke on itself.  Paying the box a little more attention may have gone a
long way towards resolving the db issue.  It just wasn't a high priority at
the time.  The company only used it for an excuse to fire someone when they
wanted to get rid of them for other reasons, but feared legal repercussions.
Or if my boss wanted some good blackmail material. ;)

I've heard of another product that somehow includes a "percentage of skin
tone colors" in it's filters.  I can't recall the name, but it might be
worth checking into if you don't want ANY porn getting through, but don't
want to otherwise restrict which sites users can visit.

It's been a while since I went through this stuff, but I believe that it
is a limitation (on 32 bit systems) of all pre-2.4 kernels, and requires
that libraries and many command line tools be updated as well.  In other
words, to use >2GB files, you need to be running a 2.4+ kernel, and
up-to-date libraries and command set.  When I first upgraded to the 2.4
kernel, the system would only sort-of handle 2GB+ file sizes because I
was using an old version of most of the system software with a 2.4
kernel (some programs had to be updated for the 2.4 kernel, but the rest
wasn't).  With this setup, some programs couldn't handle it, others could,
depending on if I was running an updated and/or relinked version of the
command.  I can't remember specifically, but I think I had problems with
cp, tar, and a few other commands.

Of course I could be senile, it's been over a year since I had any
problems with 2+ gig. files, so the details are a little vague in my
memory.

Unfortunately we don't have software freedom in our schools in
Australia, I offered to set up Linux servers using LTSP (for free) to my

Hello Andy,

Thanks for the reply, it is a pity that the Queensland Government have
taken this rather narrow path. As I said, Linux is used all over the
World with great success, I understand that your hands are tied which is
regrettable. Queensland, "The Smart State", I don't think so.

I wouldn't even bother looking at Matt's Script archive.  There's nothing

What is better for DB performance to have one big datafile for example

I found something else that may be helpful.  http://freshrpms.net/ has a lot
of packages in rpm format for different redhat versions that are hard to
find in rpms.  Personally, I have had very little luck compiling sources.
It takes a very long time to compile these and most of the time the build
fails and you have to try to determine what else is needed.

Open an xterm window, su to root, and type:

At the very least that *should* give you some more info (-v option) as

Make absolutely certain that there is NOTHING in that directory before 
you rmdir.  Also check to see if it's actually unmounted by using 
'mount' (no arguments) and looking for the sharepoint.

If everything looks okay, then yeah, go ahead.  However, leaving the 
directory won't do you any harm.  And the link is only established via 
smbmount.  The directory is made only as a point on which the mount 
command hangs the remote filestructure to.

Not a bad idea to check, but 'rmdir' will only remove 
empty directories in anycase. It's fairly safe.
For the reckless, use 'rm -rf'

Bill,

  I have this line in firewalls.ini:

/bin/ipchains -A input -p TCP -d ${OUTSIDE_IP} 80 -j DENY       #web (http)

  You'll want to make it ACCEPT on the end.

Alex,

  How about a definite "maybe"?

  If the tables are related, I strongly recommend normalizing the data and
putting the appropriate chunks in separate, but related tables. OTOH, if
it's all one, big flat file the answer probably depends on your disk speed
and filesystem structure. And, I wouldn't know in that case.

which I assume doesn't cause trouble because it comes after the others

I'm pretty sure it's not something on the web server,  because it works 
fine with a Windows firewall.

Could it be possible they are filtering YOU?
Can you reach their website/ping that host from the box you're trying to 
connect from?

tcpdump might help too :)

I'm not sure about the cause, but have you tried accessing the site with
a different client?  I had a problem with access from outside, the
customer was using CuteFTP, and my ftp server would refuse the
connection, but I had the costumer use the url

ftp://username at ftp.infotects.com

in a browser (not mentioning names), and it connected without errors
(this was not an anonymous login though).

I know this is probably describing more of a winblowz issue, but it may
be worth trying a different client, just for the information that might
give you.

Good Luck

Derek;

On neptune, what is your shell? Perhaps your shell is not listed on the
remote servers' /etc/shells file. This will cause the remote server to
close the connection immediately.

Try switching shells for this user and try the server again.

Richard,
In older databases it used to be one data file for the each table.
BerkleyDB, Gemini, ISAM, MyISAM and so on.
Modern DB datafiles have nothing to do with database structure and
tables.All databases and tables data is stored in datafile.
Oracle, PostgreSQL, InnoDB and so on. 
You can see datafile as a DB virtual filesystem. 
My question is related to DB optimization. 
What is better to have a couple of datafiles (virtual DB FS's) on the
same physical partition or just a one big datafile on the same
partition?

Thank you in advance for any thoughts and ideas.
Alex

I agree with John's diagnosis. This definitely looks like the remote is 
refusing you, not a problem on your end.

If another ftp client doesn't resolve the issue (ncftp is a good one), then 
you might check to make sure both machines are resolving the host name to 
the proper IP. I notice in the first (working) example, no IP is given in 
the welcome. In the second, it gives it's IP.

Lastly, a note to the system administrator might be in order, if no other 
resolution presents itself.

  Well, not to belabor the point, but (at least in postgres) one uses the
'create table' command for each table in a normalized database. They are
stored on disk as separate files, too. Used to be by name now it's by
number. Shrug.

  If all your tables (relations) are stored in a single, large disk file my
gut tells me that you're better off keeping that file in a single
filesystem. Unless you know how the tables are stored (which ones in which
files) and how frequently the two separate files will be accessed for an
operation, one file would be the way to go.

  I may not really understand your situation, Alex. In that case, please
excuse my impractical answers.

I like to use a serial port for a console on my lrp boxes.  It makes
them more like appliances.  Then I use a null modem to connect to an
interanl server, and minicom to emulate the terminal connection to the
router/firewall.  I've even had the lrp box reload the network from an
outside connection, and the connection was not dropped!  (Try that with
a Cisco!!)

I remembered I have another web site hosted from a different machine
hosted by the same colo.  It is actually in the same cabinet.  I sshed

to them.  I thought that was the case and all of you reinforced my

How do I make this machine stop remembering the size, shape & other 
properties of all the term windows I have opened in the past?  (Gnome 
on RH7.2, updated with up2date recently).
Some windows are big, some small, some take up the whole screen.  The 
term icon seems to remember the last 20 or so sessions' window 
attributes.  How do I make it stop?
Have unchecked "automatically remember window positions (& size & other 
attributes)" under Sawfish placement tab.  Poked around at the .gnome* 
files in my user directory, but nothing there looks relevant.

Thanks for any help.

I was trying to run Roger Wilco on a Winbox and couldn't get it to work when
I opened the port for it.

I had put a password in -the fill in the blank spot- when I configed
Floppyfw. After I added the password to the Roger Wilco parameters on the
Winbox, no problem.

I can only assume that it is on by default, and that the client mmachine
behind your firewall needs to pass it on to floppyfw.

hope this a help, but I'm only passing on my experience with opening a port.

cheers,

Hello Linux folkz,
Does somebody know if Linux kernel allows to perform non-buffered I/O on raw 
disk partitions?
In documentation on InnoDB tables it said:
By using a raw disk you can on some Unixes perform unbuffered I/O.
I assume that it should improve DB performance.
Thank you in advance for any thoughts or sources of information.

maybe, sun has run bench marks of both. 

See sun solars performance, red 911 car book. 

In some cases, sun found that data base improved with the normal file
system tweaked for database.  

A normal file system is a hell of a lot easier to deal with, I would
only go to raw partitions if I did not have to deal with the PAIN of
back ups. Or had a happy oracle tool, to grab the raw data. 

I have talk to many a oracle dba, and they have said the same. 


Do you have big DLT tape drive. 

It is far far easier to loose all of your data with raw partions. 

The free databases are no oracle / db2 as far as tool chain to back up
your data.

You are looking at, database shut down, dump the raw partitions. 

Wait a long time, hours , etc.

Sounds like a firewall issue. Try opening ftp without connecting and
specifying passive mode (then active mode if that doesn't work) to see if
the ftp server is just not making it back through a firewall.

ie:

$ ftp
ftp> passive
Passive mode on.
ftp> open www.mikeistan.com

I usta use one to tail a log file (generally the errors log for the web

This article might interest you:

Among the interesting quotes:

    For database creation, loading and indexing, Figure 3 shows that

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206040737130.7569-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I don't know if this annoyance is specific to majordomo or is common to
all MLM software. But, I'd sure like to know how to handle the problem.

  Majordomo tries to be very helpful by looking for words within the body of
the message that appear to be administrative requests sent to the list
rather than to the MLM. A nice feature, except ... when I try to send a
message to the list telling subscribers how they can have others subscribe
(or unsubscribe), any mention of the words "subscribe" or "unsubcribe"
(quoted or not) causes majordomo to send the message to me (as list owner)
rather than resending it to the list. A major PITA!

  Does anyone know how to use these two words within a message so that it
can be sent out as a regular e-mail?

TIA,

  No, but adding the '-9' flag to the kill request tells it to obey without
question. Works like a magic charm. :-)

FYI, After installing and reconfiguring multiple times, I've found OO
1.0 to be quite buggy while releases 641C and 641D have been near
flawless.  I use Redhat 7.3.

Maybe I need a luck charm, then. The process has gone 'DR', maybe it's no longer 
loading the system, right?

You can find out by running the `top' command:

  # top

Pay special attention to the `idle' number. Higher is better. 99.5 per
cent, for example, is very good.

I've got load averages running around 3 right now, when it's usually below 1, and 
according to top, only one process is running, top. 

Am I running processes that are hiding themselves from me?

Okay. Let's deploy the ``big guns.'' In your message you indicate that
it is a ``Samba mount'' that is causing df -h to hang. I can see that.
``df is trying to go out all the mount points but is not getting a good
connection from the remote host for some reason. This can also happen if
an NFS share is down.

First, change your current directory to / and unmount the samba share as
root:

  # umount /name/of/samba/mount/directory

If the umount reports the filesystem busy, you will have to unmount it
forcibly. The ``cleanest'' way to do this is to analyze the processes
using that mount, determine what they are doing, and kill them
appropriately. Second, one will inspect the mount's semaphores to make
sure it is not inappropriately using shared memory.

If you just want to unmount it, do the following. This will kill the
processes using the mount ``the hard way.''

  # fuser -km /name/of/samba/mount/directory

Now unmount the filesystem with the umount command above.

At this point I would recommend diagnosing why the remote share went
bad. Can you ping the server? Can you run `smbclient' against it?

Remount the Samba file system.

I'm giving up for now.  I just don't have the network skills to figure this 
out.  Other than the internal web server, it works fine. I think it probably 
has nothing to do with floppyfw, but with something about the network, which 
I don't know how to debug.  Thanks to all who helped.

Mike,

  The way I interpret the man page,
   PROCESS STATE CODES
       D   uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
       R   runnable (on run queue)

something is holding that process open. Is anything actively mounted via
samba, or is there an application working across that mount?

  I've now reached the limit of my knowledge.

Mike;

Based on this information I cannot fathom why `top' is showing only one
process. If you connecting remotely with a Windows box it is likely the
telnet client is not updating the screen information correctly.

I can see a few processes here that are causing a problem. Assuming the
processes are still the same, perform the following:

  # kill -9 22391

Also, I note that you have several smb daemons running. Restart them as
root:

  # /etc/init.d/smb restart

Mike;

As I look at this further, it appears that there is a copy process to
one of the mount points at process number 22563. I cannot see the entire
smbmount command line so I cannot be sure whether or not this process
has anything to do with smb.

If my previous post does not bring satisfactory results, please post the
following:

  # ps -eo pid,ppid,command


Thanks,

There are two ways to deal with this:

   1 - There should be a script file named "approve" in the bin directory
       wherever you installed majordomo.  You need to copy this to the
       system you read your email on, and when you receive the bounce
       message you can pipe the message through the approve command in
       order to get it delivered through majordomo.  NOTE: you first have
       to setup a file in your home directory with the password(s) for any
       lists you adminster for this to work.

   2 - You can embed a string which includes the list administrators
       password into the message before you send it in the first place.
       The positioning and format can be figured out from reading the
       script for the "approve" command.

I only use the first of these two methods, let the message bounce then
pipe it through "approve", otherwise it would be real easy to accidentally
send the list administrators password to the whole list.  To setup the
password file for #1, I believe the comments at the begining of "approve"
tell you everything you need to know.

NOTE: Some for mail programs such as pine, piping the message to approve
is trivial from within the mail program, for others it might be a real
pain: export the message to an external file, then in a separate window
pipe the message through the approve command.

I am looking for a source of various motherboard-type connectors that
I can use to wire up fans or LEDs (i.e., the female part to match to
motherboard's male parts).  Either one of those three pin fan headers
or the kind that you usually use to connect up the case switches/LEDs
to the motherboard.  Sorry, I don't know the techical terms for them.

I recall looking for these at Norvac years ago and coming up empty.

Thanks!

The last time I was at Fry's Electronic Jungle I saw the connectors you
are seeking. I am going that way today and can check for you if you

Maybe put the subscribe/unsubscribe info in a footer on all list

I believe a mate to the fan connector is the DigiKey part number WM2001.
Go to www.digikey.com and search for WM2001.  Note that you would also need
the contacts, part number WM2200.  To do it right, you would also need
a crimp tool for the contacts, but you can  get by with just a pair of
needle nose and a soldering iron.

I may have some extras lying around.  How many do you need?

  The unsubscribe info is there already. As we know from this (and other)
lists, it's often not noticed.

  I was asked by a couple of subscribers how others could sign on. They
apparently didn't recall what they did so I wanted to send a message to all
describing what to do. The 'approve' process will be investigated today!

Thanks,

Rich

Shannon,

  Thanks! Because my lists are not moderated, I completely forgot about
having defined approval passwords.

  I've put them in ~/.majordomo and will test to see if I can reply to the
bounce by putting APPROVE on the subject line with the original subject.

Subject: [PLUG] NIS/SMB Apache Authentication
Message-ID: <20020604225510.GA23171@subtend.net>

I'm trying to get select areas of a website to authenticate against NIS.

I installed the perl module Apache::AuthenNIS and tried the correct
syntax in an .htaccess file, but I keep getting this error message:

[Tue Jun  4 15:14:40 2002] [error] Can't locate object method
"get_basic_auth_pw" via package "Apache" at
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/Apache/AuthenNIS.pm line 11.


So, I tried switching gears and authenticating to a NT domain controller
using Apache:AuthenSmb.  Same error:

[Tue Jun  4 15:38:15 2002] [error] Can't locate object method
"get_basic_auth_pw" via package "Apache" at
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/Apache/AuthenSmb.pm line 12.


What is this get_basic_auth_pw and how can I get it kick started?  I
have a feeling I'm missing some basic package that alternative authen
modules require.

Apache and mod_perl were installed using RPM's.  The authen modules were
installed using the CPAN shell (perl -MCPAN -e shell).

Message-ID: <51C603B9AB4696408D7273AA133734AC1EAA0B@ljcms002.prod.vectorscm.com>

I recently installed grip to rip CD tracks into mp3's.  I then found that in
order to make that work, I had to install an encoder.  I found an rpm for
lame and installed it.  Now that works, but now when I try to go the other
way and burn an audio CD, it fails when the first track is in the middle of
recording.  Also, a CD player pops up and tries to play the first track.  I
ran setup and found a service called rawdevice is now running.  I notice
that if grip is running, it knows when an audio CD has been placed in the
drive and after a few seconds it has the name of the CD and all the song
titles.  Did grip add this service?  And is this interfering with writing
CD's?

  The past couple of days has seen a resurgence of e-mails infected with the
Microsoft Klez virus.  It doesn't affect us (except for the time to inform
the originating ISP of the problem with one of their customers), but it may
be bothering Microsoft shops where you folks work.

  It's curious that we had a hiatus of several weeks and now it's back

Any gcc gurus out there? I'm going around in circles on targeting specific 
CPUs. For example, optimize for k6 or i686 instead of i386. Is this a 
compiler option? make/config option? Do you need to wade through manufacturer 
specs and tailor your code itself?

links to docs welcome.

thanks much,
Carla

  From info gcc:

              i386 Options
              -m486 -mno-486 -msoft-float -mno-fp-ret-in-387
Could probably do -m686, too.

  Most of the time there's a configure option that's accessed by specifying
--target=ix86.

Ah, here's the rub. The optimization switches have changed slightly
between gcc 2.x and 3.x (the uniquely Red Hat 2.96 release is a 3.x in
disguise).

The -m486 option has been retired. The new way of doing things is, as 
Felix mentioned, -march=<whatever> or, to a lesser extent, 
-mcpu=<whatever>.

I haven't really looked to see what changes the recently released gcc 
3.1 introduced.

Hmm.  I guess my question was a little abstract.  I was remembering an
earlier problem (I wanted to build an external bank of LEDs).  Anyway,
the digikey.com was a good reference, which I appreciate.  

However, I guess my immediate problem is actually a different one: to
power a big 5-inch fan off of a 5V supply.  I had cobbled something
together years ago on a Pentium 133 box (it had a 4 gig SCSI drive
that ran hot) that I powered off on the the standard 4-pin drive power
connectors, but (I thought, cleverly) was also switchable using the
case turbo switch to select 5V or 12V (it is marked a 12V 5W fan).
Turned out it was noisy at 12V and did a fine job at 5V, so I left it
there about 99.9% of the time.

So, I guess my immediate need is to crimp on a 4-pin power connector
(the load side, with the male pins) to the two wires coming from the
fan.  I only need one "kit": two pins and a plastic terminal housing
for each botch job + 1! :-)

Kris,

My first cut is below, but after rereading you email, mod_perl does not seem
to be loading.  Check you http.conf file and make sure you can see the
libperl.so module in your /etc/httpd/modules (really /usr/lib/apache)
directory.

My first cut______________________________________

The password is available only through the Perl API with the help of the
get_basic_auth_pw() method. http://perl.apache.org/guide/security.html

The method can be found in the Mod Snake API
http://modsnake.sourceforge.net/mod_snake/doc/mod_snake_api/request-api.html

Example of its call is: http://www.perldoc.com/cpan/Apache.html

$r->get_basic_auth_pw
If the current request is protected by Basic authentication, this method
will return 0, otherwise -1. The second return value will be the decoded
password sent by the client.

   ($ret, $sent_pw) = $r->get_basic_auth_pw;

In fact this is where you can download the mod_perl module.

If you want to know if this is grip's doing and you are using rpms, you
could do something like
  rpm -q --whatprovides /etc/rc.d/init.d/rawdevices

It appears to belong to the initscripts rpm, rather than grip. Grip
doesn't look like it enables any services or does anything else nefarious

  rpm -ql grip

One of the school districts I work with had their mail server hammered by klez
today.  The admin there was sick and I took a vacation day... we both had to
come in for a little while to clean up the mess :-(

All it took was one user using Lookout (they're not a MS shop), with a bunch

It just so happens this has been an ongoing topic in AOLS 
(alt.os.linux.slackware)  :-)

http://hints.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/optimization.txt
http://hints.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/old/optimization2.txt

Those have some good info in 'em.  I see other folks answered your question 
pretty well, though.

One thing to be wary of... a K6 is *not* i686... it's but i586.  Pentium Pros 
through Pentium IVs, Celerons, I *think* VIA C3s (ick!), and AMD Athlons and 
Durons are all i686 compatable, but have specific optimizations available if 
you're using GCC 3.x.  Many distros are still with GCC 2.95.x, though, as it 
is still the official kernel compiler.

Hope this helps!  :-)

The new guy,
Rob

I don't know that we have any of those lying around.  I'd suggest buying
a 4 wire drive power extension cable and chopping off the unneeded end.

I had been resisting that option because I wasn't thinking of a
reliable way to "seal" the splice and I didn't want a hot 5V wire
bouncing around inside the box with electrical tape or something
gradually softening and falling off.  This caused me to latch on to
the connector kit option.  However, I now realize that I just need
some heat shrink tubing (which I do have somewhere) and a dab of
solder, and I _will_ have a reliable way to "seal" the splice.

Hey, I never claimed to be much of a hardware guy. :-)

  To follow up on Carla's question of yesterday, here's an observation. I'm
rebuilding the src.rpm for lyx-1.2.0 (released last Wednesday) and I see the
following two compiler directives scroll by: "-march=i386 -mcpu=i686". So,
there's apparently a difference betwixt the two.

Rich

P.S. Now I need to find the source of the error in the build.

Paul,

  I meant upgrade the entire distribution, but I see now that was not clear.
:-)

  However, there is a problem that many of us RH 6.2 users are having trying
to rebuild the lyx-1.2.0.src.rpm. Several folks reported libc++ library
incompatibilities, I just discovered a different error:

I am no programmer but a programmer asked me this.  It seems to me it
should just work.  What might be the problem?  I have no more details
now.

Thanks

##########
I have a couple .sh scripts that if I run out my shell (bash) runs fine,
but if I put on the cron (crontab) it loses its env vars (like
$SOMETHING), even calling su root -c myscript.sh on the crontab 

What should I do to make sure my .sh scripts has the env vars? (on bash
I actually call ". /etc/profile" to load them)

Things to try:

1. Make sure the shebang line calls bash explicitly (i.e.,
   #!/bin/bash rather than #!/bin/sh)

2. Add --login to the shebang line: #!/bin/bash --login

3. Specify an rcfile: #!/bin/bash --rcfile $HOME/.profile

Pointing your colleague at the INVOCATION section of the bash(1) man 
page might be worthwhile.

cron jobs run from a /bin/sh shell (unless otherwise declared with a #!
line) and a minimal environment.  `man cron' for the details.  The way to
fix the script is to either source the user's profile within the cron
script, or explicitly set the desired environment at the top of the script.

  Accoring to 'aporpos', there are no tools on my system to decode base64
encoded docs. It is (was?) a winWord .doc that someone tried attaching to a
message to a mailing list. But, it was too big and bounced to me.

  Other than raising the size limit of messages, is there something I can
use to rescue this message?

  Who's crontab is running? If it's root, then I suggest exporting the same
env vars from root's .bash_profile as from yours.

Guess what! Your environment variables aren't getting exported from the
shell process that is running your cron task!

For example, let's say you have `foo=/temp_file' in your script and you
call it from cron like so (the times are for illustration only, I don't
have cron's man page in front of me)

0 0 0 5 6 /usr/local/bin/my_cron_script

Under this scenario, cron reads your cron script and *forks another
process to run it!*

Change the cron line to this (note the period):

0 0 0 5 6 . /usr/local/bin/my_cron_script

This exports the variables it read in the parent process to the child
processes that will actually run your command.

Ugh. I tried to build LyX 1.2.0 on a Red Hat 7.3 system last week. No 
dice: there's no xforms library installed (and no rpm for one as far 
as I can tell) and the gnome libs aren't current enough to build the

Hmm. I hadn't looked into the XForms stuff before. It's not available 
in source format -- at least not now. Supposedly, the upcoming 1.0.0 
version will be released under an LGPL license.

That's too bad. I like LyX. Guess I'll just have to wait until it and 
its dependencies are libre.

On my system mimencode is part of the metamail rpm.
It's pretty standard, and you might have it installed already.

  It appears that ftp has decided to work again on host 'salmo'; at least,
from within mozilla. I'll check ncftp later today. Strange. Anyway, thank

though.)

  What is the safest way to upgrade gcc? I'm downloading a newer version now
as a .src.rpm and I'll rebuild it. Do I just do a 'rpm -Fvh gcc...' or is
there something else involved?

Description :
Metamail is a system for handling multimedia mail, using the mailcap
file.  Metamail reads the mailcap file, which tells Metamail what
helper program to call in order to handle a particular type of
non-text mail.  Note that metamail can also add multimedia support to
certain non-mail programs.

Metamail should be installed if you need to add multimedia support to
mail programs and some other programs, using the mailcap file.

I have only corresponded with two people that have machines running
Windows XP. In both instances they have not received my mail as I sent it.  
The first instance the recipient received a totally blank reply from me
(after I wrote quite a few paragraphs) which was written in Evolution. The
second instance happened this morning in attaching a .doc (from
OpenOffice1.0) in pine. I then attached the file again and cc'd myself at 
work and I received the attachment fine but the XP user didn't see any 
attachment.

Has anyone seen such things happen to them? Are there settings in XP's 
Outlook that disable/turn off attachments?

Thanks,

  Oh. I've no metamail installed. If I do install it, can I then access
mimencode separately for a file on disk? Well, guess I'll find out

Subject: [PLUG] bls-0.4
Message-ID: <FHEFJJAAILAPHOCOAGDGKEKPEGAA.john@johntelford.com>

Hello

The base Linux system (bls) distribution V0.4 is available on
http://bls.sf.net .

This base Linux system (bls) distribution is a tar ball image of a
configured, functional, running Linux system that's ready to load-and-go
onto a bare-metal box. Once loaded, configuring your networking
environment is about all that needs to be done.

Use bls as is or as a base for building Linux systems. The bls
distribution is network centric. Add or remove rpm packages to fit your
needs. Download the config file and compile a kernel the way you want
it.

Creating new Linux systems starts with downloading the bls tar ball
image and then installing it onto bare- metal boxes using tomsrtbt.

Selecting a set of runtime kernel parameters determines if the bls
distribution becomes a workstation, server, firewall, or router.

Systems built using the bls distribution may be run using a regular
console, a serial console, or totally headless. A Linux laptop running
minicom makes an excellent serial console for plugging into headless
routers and other Linux appliances created using bls.

Speaking of laptops, the bls distribution has the right stuff for
building Linux laptops from bare metal.

A ready to run Linux system is ready for use in about 10 minutes.

The base for bls distribution is the Red Hat 7.3 distribution:

Base Linux System release 4 - Mon Jun  3 14:04:00 PDT 2002
Red Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla)
Kernel 2.4.18-4custom-bls-i486-4 on an i586

I hope you enjoy using the bls distribution as much as I enjoy producing
it.

Thanks ...John

Yep.  As a matter of fact, when I use it to decode mail, I first save
the email to a file and then decode it with mimencode in a command line.

Hmm. Well I attached a .doc file so unless they are checking inside the
file they are denying all Word documents. That's smart(NOT!). Do you think
there is some inconsistency in the way OpenOffice saves the file as a .doc
that is causing this? Of course, my recipient didn't say he got a warning 
like mentioned in the article. I'm sending a native Word 2000 document 
from both Outlook Express and Evolution to find out which (or both) get 
there.

Stay tuned :-)

Not that it's actually helpful, but Outlook is known to have very broken
and non-standard attachment handling. I can point you to a large number
of evolution mailling list threads regarding this issue in a number of
contexts, including HTML mail, and encrypted mail (where it is REALLY
broken)

Why not send it as a .rtf instead?  Word will read them, and I don't 
believe macros can be embedded within.  Although I could be wrong on 
that last part.  :)

As another option, uudeview works well and can be found on freshmeat.

Also, openssl will decode base64 files as well:

	openssl enc -d -base64 < file.base64 > file.out

This is what I've doing for all the klez virii I've been getting. Alas,
nobody's sent me any interesting documents (no I *don't* need any more
web pages about irc eggdrops).

I know this is probably a stupid question, so go ahead and let me know how
uncultured I am, but...

If you have a source tar ball, is there an easy way to determine what
libraries it requires?  And what versions?

I just got my response that both documents came through. So my 
conclusion is that something in the OpenOffice conversion to a .doc throws 
up a flag. I also noticed that my 6 word native Word2000 document is 19Kb 
and my page and a half OpenOffice .doc is 17Kb. Obviously some major 
differences.

That solves the attachment issue. Who knows what happened to my reply 
that got chopped. I guess it is rtf's for me from now on.

Yes, thankfully.  Use a mirror, trust me.  I was at 98% when it must

and the web server kept giving me 404 errors and the ftp site, well,
just didn't work.  Things seem to be back to normal now, but sheesh.

Thanks for the info.  I suspected grip because grip and lame are the only
things I have installed in a while.  I seem to have a few services turned on
that I don't know why they are on.  I am not running Oracle or any other
database at the moment, so I don't see why rawdevices would be on.  I turned
it off.  The CD player that was start automatically is gtcd which is part of
a package called gnome-media.  I figured out how to turn this feature off,
but it made no difference.

Often the README or INSTALL file will tell you. Otherwise, go ahead
and run ./configure to see if it finds all the libraries and include
files it needs.

It sounds like the only thing to do then is send them Open Office files
(.sdw or whatever) and tell them they should install OO.  Or they could

I use .txt or .rtf almost exclusively. Occasionally, I'll use .html and

Subject: [PLUG] conditional redirect in shell script
Message-ID: <200206051917.g55JHOt28502@tinman.seitzassoc.com>

I want to conditionally redirect stdout to /dev/null in a shell script.
However, it appears that redirection occurs before variable expansion, 
which means my approach won't work.  What is the correct way to do this?

Here's what I currently have, but it doesn't work.  '> /dev/null' ends up
being passed to gs as an argument.

gsredirect='> /dev/null'

set -- $args
for i
do
    case "$i"
    in
	-v)
	    gsredirect=''; shift;;
	-o)
	    outfile=$2; shift; shift;;
	--)
	    shift; break;;
    esac
done

# Merge postscript files into temporary file.
/usr/bin/gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pswrite -dBATCH -sOutputFile=$tmpfile $* 
$gsredirect || {
    echo Ghostscript merge of postscript files failed. 1>&2
    myexit
}


thanks,

Ah... just when I was going to suggest doing something like...

    exec 3>&1 > /dev/null

to set up the redirect of stdout to /dev/null, and resetting it via...

    exec >&3 3>&-

You've got to eval it. Take a small example script:

#!/bin/bash
redir='> tmp.txt'
echo 'hello' $redir

Running that will produce unwanted output:

  hello > tmp.txt

Adding an eval statement makes things right:

#!/bin/bash
redir='> tmp.txt'
eval echo 'hello' $redir

Subject: [PLUG] CVS question
Message-ID: <20020605195453.GA29481@rauhaus.org>

We use rancid (http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/) to track configuration
changes to all our Cisco gear.

It saves all configs to a CVS repository via a cron job and mails any
diffs to our network engineering group.

Today, I needed to find out when a particular change was made to a
config. I'm pretty much CVS ignorant, is there a way to easily find out
in which revision a particular change first appeared?

Since the device in question didn't have a huge number of revisions, I
just did a bunch of "cvs co -r 1.x device-config" and grep'd for the
line until I narrowed it down to the revision in which it first
appeared, but I'd bet someone in plug-land knows the right way to do it.

Thanks,

Yep, I once used mutt within an organization that used Outbreak, and
everytime they sent me an attachment, I would have to save the message
in its own file, then run uudecode against it for *each* attachment.

I think cvs annotate is what you are looking for. Try
cvs annotate device-config | less

Subject: [PLUG] Trying to ID a spammer...
Message-ID: <3CFE7EE1.AECC9C5F@pcez.com>

I've been told that trying to identify spammers is a waste of
time.  Since losing my job at IBM, I have the time and wanted to
see what I could find about "inbox.org," who wants me to
refinance my house.

The spam is from rachel at inbox.org.  I suppose if you're going to
use phony names, "Rachel" is as good as any.  The offer is to
refi my house, has the usual opt-out info, and a disclaimer.

The disclaimer pronounces their right to spam me because they are
in compliance with some proposed legislation, but that if I am
not having any luck getting off their list I can contact the
"Abuse Control Center" in Canoga Park, CA.

The Center must have relocated, because a google search for the
phone# for the opt-out turned up something indicating the
so-called Abuse Control Center was in Irvine.

Trying to learn about inbox.org I ran;

$ whois "inbox.org"@whois.crsnic.net     ......which returned the
registrant as Anthony DiPierro, in Brewster, NY.

I ran a google search on DiPierro, found discussion threads he
contributed to a couple of years ago relating to C vs Perl stuff,
Free BSD vs Microsoft, and his email (anthony at inbox.org).
DiPierro at inbox.org appears to exist.  Looks like he registered
inbox.org through tucows.

I ran nslookup on inbox.org and found a matching IP address
(161.58.166.119), which I can ping.

But what now?  Is it possible that some spammer has cracked into
Anthony's machine and is using it as a base for their own
nefarious purposes, or is likly that Anthony is just a good old
New Jersey type trying to make a living by freeloading off the
Internet?

well, you could email Anthony...hopefully he knows what his mail server is

it doesn't look like an open relay.....here's a transcript:

It looks like anyone can signup with an @inbox.org account for $5/year.
There's even a link on the www.inbox.org site to report SPAM from @inbox
users.

I suppose I could open a hotmail account and email him.  Just the name of his
organization, INBOX, sounds like a spam outfit. We'll see.

  Now you know the ISP of the sender. Forward the spam -- with full headers
turned on -- to abuse at verio.net. My usual comment is:

  "Please take the appropriate actions to prevent this spammer from sending
more UCE via your servers.

Thank you,"

  Works very well.

  Ignore the "we're not spamming because some proposed legislation says what
we're doing is OK as long as we tell you how to opt out." That's nonsense.
The legislation died before it went to committee. Treat it as spam and
you'll find the ISPs are extremely helpful.

Send the email -- with full headers -- to abuse at inbox.com. You can hope
that company has a use policy that forbids spam.

Setup either a free account which gives you spam reporting privaleges or a
paying account ($30/year) which gives you preferred reporting, an email
account, and I believe a few other benefits. See http://spamcop.net/

You can setup an account just provding your email address and then you can
forward spam to a certain email address at spamcop -- with full headers --
and it will analyze the spam and determine the various abuse/postmaster
addresses to send it to.

If you wanted to devote your energy to the battle against spam, then
consider getting an account there and then sending every piece of spam you
get to spamcop.

Another good resource for anti-spam info is http://www.stopspam.org/

I have an idea for what I think would be an amusing science fiction story.
Perhaps you could be the super hero in it? :-)

In this story, this guy decides to devote his life to fighting spam. He is
kind of a cross between Case and Clint Eastwood. That is, he jacks in and
attacks the systems of spammers.

I wonder how often spammers send their stuff to skilled crackers, and then
pay the price. Surely even crackers get unwanted email from time to time.  To
crack into a spammer's box, wouldn't you have to, along the way, crack into
at least one ISP as well, to find files and logs and such leading back to the
spammer?  That would be impossibly difficult I would think.

I found this like to a vnunet article on lwn.net:

To paraphrase a quote from the article on lwn :)

"Unless you're root on the machine running silly email attachments,

  There are several individuals and companies (as well as willing ISPs) that
distribute spam for a price. They also don't take 'no' for an answer, even
when reported to their ISP.

  Now that I have postfix running here as our primary MX, I'm developing
lists of spammers: IP addresses and domain names. It's very satisfying to
peruse the maillog and see some of these turned back to the sender.

  One address, in Italy, sent over 500 spam messages a day to a user here;
they were all bounced back to the sender. This went on for several days
before they got tired and quit.

Which is pretty much a non-issue because who runs email as root anyway?

Even if there are a few doing so it seems that such a virus would not
transmit very effectively.

Is Linux pretty much immune from devastating virusus  by virtue of
the fact that it can do only so much damage in user space? Well, I guess
immune is too strong a word but highly resistant would be apprpriat?

If so this is an excellent selling point for Linux. That is, run Linux
throughout your company and worry much less about virii. In fact, sleep
well. :-)

so it's acceptable to you if the ELF can do "rm -rf" in your user space?....

  That's my understanding. There was one, proof-of-concept virus written,
but it was benign and done just to see if it could be done.

  Worms are a different matter. Remember Bob Morris Jr's famous Internet
Worm of the early 1980s?

Fair warning, if you check this out at work, there are some nude photos on

Very cool story.  Glad to hear they got what they deserved.  I noticed
that they have cell phone numbers for those evil-doers (to borrow a
phrase).  I do have free long distance.......

I think the main exposure for well maintained linux boxen is file access to
Samba shares from infected Windoze PCs.

-mcpu=i686 tells gcc to do instruction scheduling and
similar optimizations based on the assumption that the
target is an i686 chip.  If you run the resulting executable
on an i386, it may be a little slower than if you compiled
with -mcpu=i386, but it will still run.

-march=i686 tells gcc it can use machine instructions that
are only available on i686 chips, so the resulting
executable may not run on an i386 at all.

specifying -march also implies the corresponding -mcpu flag,
so "-march=i386 -mcpu=i686" means to use only i386
instructions, probably for maximum compatibility, but
optimize it for i686 chips, on the assumption that most
people out there have an i686.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206051822280.18022-100000@antares.mpcu.com>

I've been researching this for a little bit now and still don't have an 
answer yet.  I have an older phone switch that has a DB-25 connect 
originally designed for a serial printer.  From my reading of the manual 
for the phone switch (KSU), this service is called "SMDR" and all it did 
was record the transactions the KSU went thru in the course of answering 
phone calls.

Rather than using a serial printer, I'd like to capture the output via a 
serial connection to a linux host.  I know I can use a terminal program 
such as minicom or kermit.  But I'd like to know if the input to 
/dev/ttyS0 can be logged directly thru the use of a pipe to a service such 
as syslogd?

Thanks for any input PLUGgers can provide.

  Never mind. Errors in the .spec file. When I look at the directory
structure, I see that the info/ and man/ directores are up one level. That
is, under /usr/ and not under /usr/share/.

  Bit by bit I'm finding these errors and soon I'll actually have a build
run to completion -- without errors.

Well from an ISP's side I know we take spammer's very seriously.  I get about 
3-5 Abuse messages filtered down to me from Corporate every day.  Spam, SEC 
subenas, DCMA, RIAA, MPAA.  I get them all, my personal feeling about some of

This might not be Outlook or Evolution's fault.

Are you using Postfix? There is a bug that is fixed in the latest
version that causes attachments sent from 8-bit capable MTAs to 7-bit
MTAs to go haywire.

If you are using Postfix, you might want to see if that is the problem.

I would also look at the maillogs to see if there are any other
interesting weirdneses.

This is going to be interesting...

There is a meeting with the "US Cyber-Security Czar" in the same
building at the same time.

I am sure the security paranoid will make things difficult for those
wearing black trenchcoats and carrying lots of electronic equipment.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206052049580.15545-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  As I sit here waiting for gcc-2.95-110 to recompile, it occurs to me that
over the past several weeks I've rebuilt quite a few RH 7.3 src.rpms on my
6.2 system and used them to freshen the installed packages. "So", I says to
me, "how do I get a list of all the latest packages to compare with with I
have installed here?"

  If I go to ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/7.3/en/os/i386/SRPMS/, I can
get a list of all packages there, but I don't know how to redirect that list
to a file on my local system.

  Is it reasonable to finish the upgrade by rebuilding the packages I've yet
to upgrade, then install the latest 2.4.x kernel (which, I presume, includes
glibc-2.2) and have the equivalent of the most recent 7.3 system? My
understanding of up2date and the other RH upgrade tools is that they get the
.rpm rather than the src.rpm. So, should I upgrade the kernel first, then
just use the 7.3 rpms? Finally, how does one change the flag within the
system to indicate that the distribution is, for example, 7.3 and no longer
6.2 or 6.1 as 'salmo' reports.

  I don't have a set of 7.3 disks or ISOs so I'm thinking of doing the
upgrade piece-meal as I have time. A few packages each evening.

Thanks,

Rich

Some say therein lies the bigger issue - the cost of spam.  Although
each spam mail itself is small volume, en masse it accounts for a
sizeable chunk of bandwidth (which costs money). The time spent by
admins such as Sean costs money.  Notwithstanding, we all have family
and friends who are gullible enough to fall for spam-scam and lose money
- whether their trying to lose weight around their thighs or increase
the weight of their genetalia, etc.

My guess is that in the end we'll find that as strong legal penalties as
can feasibly be enacted for spammers and virus authors alike will help,
what else will it take that is constitutionally alowable?

Well from an ISP's side I know we take spammer's very seriously.  I get
about 
3-5 Abuse messages filtered down to me from Corporate every day.  Spam,
SEC 
subenas, DCMA, RIAA, MPAA.  I get them all, my personal feeling about
some of 
this is mixed but spam is tracked down with a vengance.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206052132330.17912-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I'm temporarily stymied. Before I can upgrade gcc-* I need to upgrade
libstdc++-*, but there are too many dependencies on the current version.

  Do I just install the new libraries so I have both on my system, similar
to installing a kernel package rather than upgrading the existing one?

Thanks,

I'd say the chances approach 0. Microsoft is not that stupid. The height

Ah yes: Rodona Garst. Slashdot mentioned this site a couple of years ago.
I believe she's on record as denying that she is or was a spammer.

There's some suspicion about whether this was the work of an actual cracker,
or an acquaintence of Ms Garst (i.e., a former coworker, a former lover, or
both).

IIRC, these photos are fairly tame, even measured against the photos in
Playboy, & frankly Ms Garst isn't all that attractive. In other words, if
you like this kind of stuff or if you don't like this kind of stuff, these
pictures aren't worth the effort to see.

Right. Documentation is all doing under /usr/share these days. Red Hat 
made the switch in a couple stages from 6.2 to 7.1.

It seem to me the 'right' way to build portable .spec files is to use 
the _infodir and _mandir variables for info and man pages

  %files
  %{_prefix}/bin/foo
  %doc %{_infodir}/foo*.info.gz
  %doc %{_mandir}/man1/foo.gz

rather than storing them relative to _prefix

  %files
  %{_prefix}/bin/foo
  %doc %{_prefix}/share/info/foo*.info.gz
  %doc %{_prefix}/share/man/man1/foo.gz

The same is true when running configure:

  CFLAGS="%{optflags}" \
  ./configure \
    --prefix=%{_prefix} \
    --infodir=%{_infodir} \
    --mandir=%{_mandir}

That way, it doesn't matter if you build for 5.x, 6.x, or 7.x -- all 
the documentation goes to the right spot.

Rich,

Here's a list of the packages included on the three downloadable Red 
Hat 7.3 .iso images:

The numbers in brackets indicate on which disk (1, 2, or 3) the

I did something similar using the "screen" utility and its file logging
option. That way I was able to  remotely connect to the screen process
and interact with the console, or just tail the log file.

I'm mostly interested in fundamentals of data organization and

Subject: [PLUG] Dual Boot Partitioning Suggestions Please
Message-ID: <3CFF8C3A.45380FD4@attbi.com>

I'm getting ready to take the Debian plunge. I have a 10GB drive for my
Thinkpad 390x (450 Mhz Celeron w/ 96MB RAM) on which I currently have
Red Hat 7.1 as installed from a set of K12LTSP CDs. I want to set up the
drive to dual boot Linux and Win98. My intention is to use this as a
learning experience. I've followed the discussions about RH vs Debian vs
Mandrake vs etc., and since I have successfully installed RH on 2
machines, I'd like to give Debian a try so I can determine for myself
which I like better.

So my questions are:

1) How many partitions and what size for each?

2) What order to install, i.e. Win98 first or Debian first?

3) I have a broadband connection. Is it practical to do an installation
   over the net, or should I download images and burn CD's? I have a CD
   burner on my other RH machine.

Thanks in advance.

I've had this conspiracy theory for a long time that many virii are written
by employees of companies that sell anti-virus software.  I would never
write a virus or anything else destructive, but if I worked at such a
company, it would occur to me that if someone came out with a really bad
virus and we immediately had the cure, it would be good for me and my
company.  Certainly, most people would be morally opposed to this, but
surely some would not be.

I think I first heard this theory in 1998 when Melissa hit and all three 
major virus companies had updated pattern files within 4.5 hours 
(TrendMicro won with a 3-hour response). 

Hmm.

Hmmm.  If it's just for trying stuff out, I'd do this with 10Gb:

1.  Wipe it totally clean.
2.  Create 1 partition for Win98.  (I'd guess 2GB, but that depends on how
much room you'll need there.)
3.  Format that partition (fat32 I guess... the installation will do it) and
install Win98.

Then you can get to work on the real system. :)

Take the remaining space (8 GB in this case) and divy it up... there's so
many ways to do it (separate /boot, /var, /usr/local, etc) but just for your
own laptop and messing around with I'd do:


swap 		based on mem.... I'd do 128MB or so
/		3GB
/home		the remainder (almost 5GB)


At this point you'd have a total of 4 simple partitions, all of which can be
"primary".  (Avoiding the whole logical partitions thing.)  You'd tell the
install to put your bootloader in the MBR, and it will be able to load
everything.  You should't really have to worry about the location of your
/boot anymore, either.


If you want a separate /var (not a terrible idea... apt will use a lot of
space in there just by itself) make /home a little smaller.  If you don't,
just pay attention to your disk usage, clean the apt-cache and logs once in
a while and don't let your root fill up. :)

Basically give yourself plenty of room for lots of programs and goodies,
plus a big enough storage spot (/home) that you never delete.  (Survives
from one linux install to the next.  So when you try out slack or gentoo,
your stuff stays with you... just wipe out root and install the new system
there.)  


> 2) What order to install, i.e. Win98 first or Debian first?


Win98 first, so it doesn't whine and complain about things it doesn't
understand.  (Or blow out your MBR... which it probably will.  Easier to
install grub or lilo and dual boot after it is already there anyway.)

Downloading would be no sweat.  In fact, I'd recommend it.  (Debian,
Progeny, Libranet, and so forth all did fine for me over cable.)  To get
started, you'd need either boot disks or a boot CD.  The official ones would
start you out on Potato (debian 2.2 aka stable) which is a tad dated.  The
"testing" branch is pretty up to date, and seems stable enough for anything
short of serious server duty.  There are "network installation boot CD's"
for the testing branch and they've worked good for me.  (Less hassle than
floppies for me.)

Find them here:

http://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/ 


Also, at one point in the installation you'll get to choose between certain
default configurations, or to go custom.  DO NOT CHOOSE CUSTOM.  It will put
you in dselect, which would be absolutely horrid if you don't know how to
use it.  Especially in comparison to the way "custom" installations in
Mandrake and RedHat work.  (Including the console installations.)  It'd be
easier to drop things you don't want and add things you didn't get by using
apt after you are done.  For now, at least.


Other tips:

The list of locations apt looks for installing/upgrading stuff is in
/etc/apt/sources.list.  Some lines might be commented out (security updates
in particular) by default.  Uncomment them.  (This will probably make more
sense to you once you actually see the file.)

Want something?  Run "apt-get update" to freshen up the lists.  "apt-get
install foo" to install foo.  "apt-get remove foo" to get rid of it.
"apt-get upgrade" to upgrade all of your programs to their latest
versions/patches.  There's lots more, but that is good to start.


Good luck!


Jeremy

Ho ho!  You will never get a definitive answer on this.  It really
depends on exactly what you will do with the machine.  If I was going to
use a setup like yours as a workstation, here is what I might do:

	/boot:  8MB (I've caught flack for allocating so little space
	before, but with a little maintenance, it serves me well.)
	/var:   2.4GB
	/usr:   3.5GB
	/home:  3.0GB
	/tmp:   300MB
	/:	600MB
	(swap):	240MB

	Total:  ~10GB

But this is *only* my opinion!  It is loosely based on what I do with my
workstations (development and general use).

> 
> 2) What order to install, i.e. Win98 first or Debian first?

It will be easier to install Win98 first--it overwrites the MBR whether
you like it or not.  Then you can install Linux and tell your boot
loader to boot both Windows and Linux.

It is very practical to do this!  What I do is get a minimal
installation working (less than an hour's download at 720kbps), then
install other packages as I need them.  This way I install only what I
need.

Tastes vary, but on a notebook I am inclined to just plop everything
in one:

  /dev/hda1 (windows crap, size as small as is comfortable)
  /dev/hda2 (swap partition, twice your memory size is a reasonable choice)
  /dev/hda3 (GNU/Linux, the rest)

I've always installed (or it was already installed) windows first.

I just did this on a new box and here's what I did.  I got a "net
install" image, around 30 meg, and burned it to a CD.  Then I can boot
off of that CD and load the necessary bootstrapping, then connected to
the debian archive and did the rest from the network.  That way, you
are only sucking down what you are actually going to use.  If you
can't boot from a CD-ROM, then you can download and copy floppy images
(the number can vary, depending on your needs)

Also, I've been switching all my machines over to grub.  I've found it
is more reliable and in a pinch I can boot off of a grub floppy and
still load kernel images off of the hard disk.

I misread the original post.  My recommendation assumes that you have
10GB to dedicate to Linux.  Adjust accordingly.

Subject: [PLUG] PLUG resume database project
Message-ID: <200206061646.g56GkbM07628@gate.daniloff.com>

Hello Linux folkz,
One of our PLUGers David and me started to work on PLUG resume
database project for unemployed folkz.

So far we have set up replicated MySQL database to store your resumes.
Pretty soon we are going to start developing resume search and output
interfaces. 

But there are still some questions regarding DB configuration.
Please see the description below and asked questions.
Thank you in advance for any thoughts or sources of information.

If somebody would like to participate in this project please call me
at: 
503-547-2204 during normal business hours. We'll plug you in.  

Data safety and redundancy problem is solved by replicating one
database on another (master - slave relationship).
The server simultaneously runs two MySQL databases on different RAID0 
partitions. 
Both databases provide output (select queries) to the users and client
API 
programs through the load balancing interface. 
But user input (insert and update queries) can be done only on master 
database. That propagates them to slave database with adjustable delay
time 
between slave-master reconnection. In case of one RAID0 failure,
remaining 
database becomes the master and continue to handle load until failed
RAID0 
drive is replaced and array is rebuilt. 
This approach eliminates nessesity in tape drive and periodical backup

procedures.

There are still some questions remain: 
What is better to use for data storage DB datafile on top of existing 
filesystem or raw device partition?  
InnoDB ACID compliant tables in MySQL can use both approaches.
But in case with raw device partition InnoDB can perform unbuffered
IO.
As it said on their web site http://www.innodb.com - using raw device 
partition should improve performance on some UNIXes. 
But what is about Linux?
If it's not true for Linux what filesystem is the best to home InnoDB 
datafile?
Does DB performs better when it has smaller or bigger DB datafile or
raw 
partition? 
What is more practical to assign one big e.g. 10GB datafile / raw
partition 
for DB or start with smaller 100M datafile / raw partition and add
additional 
datafile / raw partition when the first one becomes full?

If you have a better idea for safe data storage, 
integrity and operation, please let us know.

Alex

As a former AV employee, I can tell you there's no need 
for the AV companies to do so.  Most virus authors are 
writing viruses as some sort of recognition and send 
their viruses to the AV companies.  And plenty of script 
kiddies are out there using the virus kits available.
And if an AV company was found to fund a virus author, 
that would mean near instant death.  With the wild 
claims of how much money a virus can cost a company that 
gets infected and then being able to sue a company 
responsible, figure it out.
The Dual OS was probably a proof of concept from someone.
Melissa had a fix quickly since it wasn't a very subtle 
virus and easy to detect.

Thanks, that's reassuring.  I guess I just can't understand the motivation
that these people have to write destructive code.  I can understand the
juvinile delinquent script kiddies, but it doesn't seem like they would have
the skills or the deligence to write something this complex.  Personally, if
I was going to spend that much time and effort on writing code, I would want
to write something that would make me some money.  I don't think it would
look good on a resume to say that you were the main developer on the Melissa
Virus project...  

Anyway, I got flamed a while back for making a statement like what are the
parents of a 13-year-old doing while he is doing this type of stuff, so I'll
try to avoid that again.

This is way to small for a 2.4 kernel on Debian, Debian uses an initrd
file system during boot, and the kernel packages place the initrd file in
this directory, so between the kernel, map file, and initrd image, it uses
over five megabytes, which means you wouldn't have any room for installing
a new kernel.  In addition, the initrd file sizes vary considerably
depending on the processor architecture the package is built for.
If you want to have room for at least three kernels and not have to worry
about repartitioning in the near future, I would go with at least 30 Meg,
I currently configure all my new systems with 50 Meg for /boot (yeah I
know it seems ridiculous, but I sometimes keep more than half a dozen
kernels installed when I am doing development).

I am going to be converting Klamath Community College's email server from 
Eudora Worldmail on NT to sendmail on Linux, and was wondering what others 
use as a anti virus tool.  I'm planning on using procmail to thrash vbs, 
exe, bat, etc, but would also like to scan for viruses.  I've seen that 
TrendMicro and a few other companies have solutions, but they are really 
expensive.  What I really want is Symantecs security appliance, with 
Firewall, proxy, vpn, and anti virus in a box, but it is rather cost 
prohibitive for a small school such as KCC.  It is looking like the best 
solution is AMaViS with a scanning engine, and am looking at Symantec's 
command line scanner for Linux, cause its relatively cheap, and we use 
Symantec all over the place anyway.  Has anyone tried this? is there a 
better, low cost solution. (doesn't need to be free, but low cost).

I will also have a three disc set of Mandrake 8.2.  (Not recommended for
those with IDE-Zip drives.)

I do not need or want blanks in return.  (I am picky about media and I
buy them in spindles of 100.)

Exactly what process are you following to burn an audio CD?  And are you
burning from mp3, wav, or headerless pcm files?

Is rawdevice the thing that is loading the generic scsi and scsi emulation

That's just a guess off the top of my head.  I know diddly about Red
Hat.  Commercial software isn't my thing.

This is a simple cddb (likely freedb) lookup.  It's a single subprocess of
grip that is launched as soon as the CD id data is read.

As was made clear before, grip likely added no services.

My guess about virus writers is that they don't have access to real
programing tools, like a compiler or decent scripting langauges (name
your poison here). The first big wave of viruses was back in the late
1980s & early 90s when most computer users were limited to what came
installed with DOS: debug & assembler. It was far easier to write
a virus than, say, a word processor, so a lot of viruses were created
as learning exercises. And many fell into the hands of malicious folks.

Now that the Internet has made good quality compilers available for
the cost of a lengthy download, most would-be virus writers have moved
on to more interesting -- & rewarding -- projects. And it shows in that
where once there were hundreds of infective or boot viruses, now there
are only a few dozen VB viruses. In response to Scot's comment, there
are certain circles where saying you wrote the Melissa virus indeed
earns you cred; but these are very small circles, & aren't very supportive.

Sorry if I didn't provide enought information.  I'll try to fill in.

I am using a front end program called gtoaster.  I use mp3 files.  I believe
that gtoaster uses mpg123 to convert the files to wav and then uses cdrecord
to actually burn them.  I have an IDE Sony burner.  It is 8X but I usually
burn at 4X because I have made far fewer coasters that way.  I am using SCSI
emulation with ide-scsi and sg kernel modules as described in the CD Burning
Howto.

I think the whole rawdevices thing was a red herring.  I haven't installed
much lately and I checked my services to see what was running and found
that.  I don't know why that was being loaded, but I removed it and had no
change.  I suspected that because I am wondering how grip can tell that a CD
has been placed in the drive as soon as it closes.

Sorry, I'll try to do better.  Could it just be a bad mp3?  The mp3's were
encoded with lame and I can play them on a windows PC with mmplayer.  I have
made many audio CD's in the past, but this is the first time I have tried
with mp3's that I ripped myself.  I will try to make an audio CD with other
mp3's just to test this theory.  (I know I should have tried this already,
but I'm thick-headed!)  The only change I have made to my system was to
install grip and lame, so I thought that was related to my problem.

Message-ID: <PMOKXV2ULYGC83MHIHFCYUXUGA74CA.3cffca0a@mike>

I've just returned from a church rummage sale. Under a Lexmark inkjet for 
$3.00, I found an IBM P/N 53G9712, FRU P/N 66G3574. It looks like it's in 
fine shape, no smoothness from being handled a lot, no bent pins. There is no 
power supply, if it even needs one. I just can't stand it to see this kind of 
thing go to waste if there's anybody that needs it. If I don;t get a plugger 
to speak for it, It's going on eBay.

It's got a proprietary 3.25" plug on one side and fdd, video, kbd, mouse, 
parallel port, 9 pin serial port and two PCMCIA slots on the other side.

I'm guessing that it fits a Thinkpad 360, 750, 755, 760 or 720, but I'm not 
sure. I've got some warranty papers, a floppy that says it's a 720/720c 
PCMCIA driver disk.

I'm in it for $2.00. If you want it shipped (I live in Sandy) please pay for 
the shipping.

There's one on eBay right now:

As well as, this is grounds for immediate termination at every virus

(Symantec) and had close dealings with folks from another (McAfee). I've 
also worked cursorily with a couple others.

I admit it's an interesting theory, and possible, but for most folks, 
highly unlikely.

As for the response time... How fast can a kernel fix come out for linux? I 
think the record is just a couple of hours. Once the notification of a 
virus hits the media, figure the things been out for AT LEAST 8 hours. More 
likely, 24. By that time, the virus detection companies probably already 
have at least one sample. I know for a fact that Symantec and McAfee employ 
a team of developers that tear apart virii and figure them out. It doesn't 
take long, and once you've done a few, you get quick at it.

Debian, I would not do for a laptop. 

If you are going the debian route, I would go for the testing. 

Does Debian, do journaling file system , by default ??

Aka no more fsck :) 

Next drive I buy, I am going for xfs from SGI. 

I can fsck the driver , while I use it .

dhcpcd can also run scripts wheit it acquires, renews, or releases the
interface. Also, ifup can run local scripts, on Redhat /sbin/ifup-local,
after it configures the interface. You can reinitialize your firwall from
there. As far as ip address, you can use dhcpcd's info file or parse output
of ifconfig (which has an advantage that it works for all devices, static,
dhcp, or pump).

Probably 5 GB for each OS. Win98 should be installed
first, since it always overwrites the MBR. Linux
requires at least a root and swap partition; all
distributions I know set up the swap partition
automatically. (Whether it would be worthwhile to
further subdivide the Linux installation on a *laptop*
may be an arguable matter.)

Unless the network installation is fully automatic, it
would be better to burn CD's. If you ever need to
reinstall, the CD's would be advantageous.

I've tried Win4Lin lately and like it. On a laptop, if
this were an issue with me, I'd seriously consider
installing Linux alone and then running Windows in a
virtual console. (If you have any hardware that is
supported only by Windows, such as a scanner or
digital camera without Linux support, you need a
native Windows partition on at least one computer.)

Why not?  I've been using Debian on my laptops for six or seven years
without any Debian related problems (I have had some driver problems, but
that's a kernel issue, not Debian specific).

Yes, and keep in mind the purpose of the person asking the question.  They
specifically WANT to try out Debian on the laptop.  And have tried some
others.

Nothing wrong with taking it out for a spin.  I'm guessing he wants to
determine for himself what he prefers.  And will probably be trying others
in time as well, just to see what they are like.

Dunno whether Dick's ever installed Debian or not, but the install utility
asks if you'd like to partition a disk and if you'd like to make and
activate a swap partition.  It's "automatic" insofar as you don't need to
run mkswap yourself, but it's an optional part of the installation
procedure.

The network installation IS, in fact, fully automatic.  I've never burned
a Debian CD and wouldn't unless I was building a computer without a
network connection at all (and what's really the point of that?).

Well, he didn't say WHY he wanted the Windows partition.  We're probably
better off not poking our noses into Dick's business too much.  I mean, if
he was really explicit as to why he thought he needed Windows, we could
probably find a way around it entirely.

I want to rebuild one of my servers.  I host email on it and want to move 
the user accounts and directories onto another server.  Isd there a HowTo 
that lists the steps to do this using TAR?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206061730050.14083-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I received a bugzilla notice from Red Hat that ghostscript had a security
hole patched. So, I ftp'd the 6.2 upgrade packages that included a bunch of
VFlib stuff.

  Trying to freshen the installed ghostscript I learned that it needed the
VFlib packages and those, it turns out, need xtt-fonts, too. A bit of
checking revealed that the xtt-fonts and VFlib are all for Japanese Kanji
fonts. Because I can't read Japanese -- regardless of font -- I don't need
this support, but it appears that's not an option.

  Has anyone else run into this? When the RH ftp server is less busy I'll
see about grabbing a copy of -6.52 from the 7.3 updates and rebuild that.
Maybe then I can exclude CJK support.

Dennis is bringing a projector.  Thank Dennis very much.
That is good for tonight.  In the longer run, we need to
refine our system of getting projectors.

Subject: [PLUG] shell scripting problem
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0206061747010.17170-100000@lukem.com>

I have about 200 names in /etc/group that I want to remove.  They're all
under a generic "users" group.  I have a file that contains the names that I
want to remove, and I'm looking for a wizbangwowzerz *nix way to read in
all those names and delete them from the group file.  I'll also need to
delete the comma after each name.

I'm thinking something along these lines...

for name in `cat namefile`;do sed s/$name,// group;done

Obviously this won't work, but that's sort of where I'm thinking now...
pull each name and the following comma out of the group file and then
somehow magically rewrite the group file when I'm done.

Any suggestions?
Thanks,
~M

No HOWTO on this AFAIK, Lonnie (aside from `man tar' :). You'll want to keep
the same uids and gids when you create the users on the new box so that the
file permissions on the home dirs and mail spool will be correct. And then,
there's ftp space, too. Would it be possible to back up the old server and
restore it to the new one, using one of the many backup utilities
available...

this should do the trick, from the Book of TOR, chaper 19.17  
cd /home
tar cf = . | cat | (cd /mnt/root/home; tar xbf xbf 1 -)
cd /var/spool/mail
tar cf = . | cat | (cd /mnt/root/var/spool/mail; tar xbf xbf 1 -)

grab these files the /etc/
password, shadow* , group 

let yea files flow,

Make the script above executable.

Check out the password and shadow files in the /tmp directory to see

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206061818340.14383-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Reading the logrotate.conf man page, I see that instructions for rotating
logs for various and sundry processes are supposed to be included in the
file. No mention of /etc/logrotate.d/.

  My log files have not rotated since Feb. 17, 2002 despite having a time
specification of 'weekly' or 'daily'. They're all files in /etc/logrotate.d/
while /etc/logrotate.conf has general instructions, plus the instruction to
'include /etc/logrotate.d'.

  How do I go about debugging this lack of log rotations?

Thanks,

Rich

I am trying to connect to a local ISP without much success.  You will note my current email is msn.com.  It has no help for Linux - no surprise there.

I subscribed to arczip because they offered ppp connectivity.  So far, no luck connecting.  I have been through what I think are all of the diagnostics for PAP and CHAP.  Again, no luck. The connection is actually made to the server but then disconnects.  Depending on the layer that I am testing I either get errors that point to CHAP or errors that point to the modem.  I have an email in to Viking in case I need to upgrade the modem drivers.

The OS is Redhat Linux 7.2, the modem is an external 56k Viking modem.

Any ideas?  Changing ISPs is certainly an option if there is a cleaner ppp provider.

Thanks,

Pete

Rich,

Does /etc/crontab have the line...

    01 0 * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.daily

If so, does /etc/cron.daily/00-logwatch look correct?

I can't imagine how it does.

I mean, you're removing one name from the original group file each time
and writing out a new newgroup file for each name you remove.

So if your group file contained:
amy
bill
charlie
david

And namelist contained:
bill
david

for name in `cat namelist`; sed /$name/d group > newgroup; done

would yield a newgroup that read:
amy
charlie
david

after one iteration and after the second iteration:
amy
bill
charlie

You're better off copying group to group.old before you begin and adding a
`mv newgroup group` before the loop exits.

Hmm, wouldn't that overwrite newgroup each time through the loop?  What about this:

cp group group-temp1
cat namelist | while read name
do
  sed /$name/d group-temp1 > group-temp2
  mv -f group-temp2 group-temp1
done
mv -f group-temp1 group

Okay, I'm a novice, so feel free to rip that up. . . .

How about:

#!/bin/sh

namefile=$1

infile="/etc/group"
temp1="temp1"
temp2="output"

cp ${infile} ${temp1}

while read user;
do
	sed -e "s/${user},//" -e "s/[^^]${user}//" ${temp1} > ${temp2}
	cp ${temp2} ${temp1}
done < $namefile

sed -e "s/,$//" ${temp1} > ${temp2}
rm ${temp1}

exit 0


the script would be given an argument representing the names list file,
and would put the output into 'output'; e.g., 'script.sh namelist'.

Sandy,

# run-parts
01 * * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.hourly
02 4 * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.daily
22 4 * * 0 root run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
42 4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly

  Nope. It's 02 at 4 am.

  There is no file of that name. In that directory I have:

[rshepard at salmo /etc/cron.daily]$ ls
1postfix*        dailyscript*  makewhatis.cron*  tetex.cron*  tmpwatch*
check-packages*  logrotate*    slocate.cron*     tetex.cron.rpmorig*

  The 1postfix script gives me the daily summary of activities, but that's
cumulative across the entire logfile contents. That's the reason I want to
have the mail log rotate daily.

Thanks,

Rich

It's all going to depend what sort of logrotate configuration you have 
for your mail log. Most of the time I think things are configured to 
rotate a file once it exceeds it's maximum allowed size. If the file 
size isn't exceeded then it wouldn't be rotated. There is a "daily" 
directive that you can specify in the logrotate configuration for your 
mail log to cause the file to be rotated on a daily basis.

I agree, it doesn't make sense, but it does work.  Anyone care to explain

Here's your script. Change the variables accordingly:

#************************Cut Here******************************
#!/bin/bash

group_file=/tmp/group
output_file=/tmp/group.out
name_file=/tmp/names

cat $name_file | while read name
do
  sed -e s/:$name// -e s/,$name// -e s/,$name,/,/ -e /$name/d
$group_file > $output_file
done

#*********************End Script******************************

For things like this, my approach is to turn namefile
into a sed script and then apply that script.  Something
like this:

    for name in `cat namefile`; do
        echo "s/,$name,/,/"
        echo "s/:$name,/:/"
        echo "s/,$name\$//"
    done > sedscript

    sed -f sedscript group > newgroup

If you're feeling brave, you can write that so it doesn't
need any temporary files at all.

Oh, man... be VERY careful with pattern matches.

Look at this:

> Here's a test namelist:
[snip]
> m

You have a name that's just "m".  And so your sed pattern is just
"m".  Not ^m:, just m.

So you lose all these:

because they've all got m in them, somewhere (usually in the word
"daemon").

Tony,

  I had both weekly and a maximum size specified; just changed it to daily
for maillog. But, ... *all* my logs have been growing since 2/17/02, none
have apparently rotated even though in /etc/logrotate.d/ each is directed to
rotate weekly.

  This is why I'm trying to better understand what's going on. The proper
directives are there but they're not being followed. For example, yesterday
afternoon, I changed the /etc/logrotate.d/maillog from 'weekly' to 'daily'.
This morning's log still summarizes everything since I initiated postfix.
Something's not right.

Thanks,

Rich

Actually, that is the default. I changed mine because I've got some stuff I
want retired at midnight for correct daily/monthly accounting.

That may be a distro diff. I'm running RH7.2 on that particular box.

Does /var/log/cron show the cron job is firing? If so, you could sprinkle
some debugging echo's in the cron job to see WTF (can I say that?) is going
on.

I also have to wonder why not.  I have been happily using Debian
unstable on my laptop for two years.  They even have a mailing list
specifically for laptops.  See
http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe.

No.  Does testing or unstable even come with a 2.4 kernel?

Not sure about that.  I'm running ext3, and right now, when I boot, I
get a message saying "EXT3-fs warning: maximal mount count reached,
running e2fsck is recommended"

Debian unstable has been working like a charm on my Dell Latitude CPXj for a
very long time.  Everything works great even when plugged in the docking
station.

I agree that testing would be the best branch to try out for the first time
user.  You can get the 2.4 kernel and ext2, ext3, or reiserfs if you use the
bf2.4 boot floppies that can be found at the following url.
http://http.us.debian.org/dists/testing/main/disks-i386/current/images-1.44/bf2.4/
It is just my opinion but here is the advise that I usually give people
trying to install debian for the first time.  In the installer it is
probably best to accept the defaults for most things except for partitioning
(actually there aren't any defaults here you have to do it yourself).  To
get a fully functioning system with X say yes tasksel and select X window
system (something like that anyways), games (if you like them), C/C++
programming stuff.  Say no when asked if you want to run deselect.  The
install can be accomplished pretty quickly with a broadband connection,
probably an hour or less.

[Yeah, Mike, I'm being predictable... :-)]

I'd use perl, just because sed doesn't seem to me as clean about
differentiating words from substrings.

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

my $tmpoutput = '/tmp/group';
my @goners = ();

open( GONERS, "< /list/of/oldusers.txt" ) or die $!;
while (<GONERS>) {
  chomp;
  push @goners, $_;
}
close( GONERS ) or die $!;

open( TMPOUT, "> $tmpoutput" ) or die $!;

open( GROUP, "< /etc/group" );
while ( <GROUP> ) {
  foreach my $user ( @goners ) {
    # don't delete whole groups, only users
    next if /^$user:/;
    s/\b$user,?\b//;
  }
  s/,$//;
  print TMPOUT $_;
}
close( GROUP ) or die $!;

close( TMPOUT ) or die $!;

exit;

Sandy,

  Only the run-parts script is shown; e.g., 
root (06/07-07:01:01-19794) CMD (run-parts /etc/cron.hourly)
root (06/07-04:02:00-15337) CMD (run-parts /etc/cron.daily)
root (06/02-04:22:00-19995) CMD (run-parts /etc/cron.weekly)

  So, no logrotate anywhere in there.

  Hmmm-m-m-m. What magic debugging dust do I sprinkle in there?

Thanks,

Rich

  Over the past couple of days I've received several spam that were routed
through this domain. Unfortunately, they were also routed through aracnet's
mail server so my postfix filters didn't catch them. Do you want the domain
names of the originating spammers?

  This one got through because it was addressed to the list. But, I did some
searching last evening and traced the IP address block to a company that has
sub-IP address blocks rented to domains that appear suspiciously like spam
factories. I put every /24 address in /etc/postfix/badip so we'll see what
happens.

Here's your script. Change the variables accordingly:

You might try to force the logroll, there is a option under the logrotate man 
page.

I talked with Karl Hegbloom, who currently admins the PLUG list, and he 
tells me that you can post to the PLUG list without being subscribed. The 
reason is that he setup a news gateway, whereby people can participate in 
the PLUG list via NNTP. In order to do this he had to set things up so 
that people can post to the list from outside of the list.

As for dealing with spam, Karl tells me that he wants a volunteer who has 
experience working with spamassasin to set it up for PLUG.

Any volunteers please email karl at microsharp.com

there should be a line in /etc/cron.daily that says logrotate, This will

The problem is that they don't need to BE subbed to post to the list...

I tested this last week by posting to the list from home, where I'm not 
subscribed.  This needs to be fixed so we stop getting spammed.

I asked this very question of Karl Hegbloom, the list admin, and he told 
me it is because he recently setup a news gateway. That is, you can read 
and post to the list via. NNTP. Karl wants to use spamassassin to deal 
with spam.

I would like to know if anyone out there is actually using the PLUG list 
using a news reader? I bet almost everyone does this through email. If 
that is the case, I see no reason to continue the news gateway and hence 
no reason to continue allowing non-subscribers to post to this list.

Of course, I could be wrong and everyone and his brother might be 
accessing this through NNTP now. But to me it is one of those if it ain't 
broke why fix it? If an email list is working well, why add news access 
when many are not likely to use it?

Is it possible to allow reading through NNTP, but if someone wants to post
they can do it through email?
By the way anyone who wants to harvest the list for individual email
addresses only needs to subscribe and then go to the web page and download
the list. This feature needs to be shut off globally. Only 2 people have
shut it off for their own email address.

I talked with Karl Hegbloom, who currently admins the PLUG list, and he
tells me that you can post to the PLUG list without being subscribed. The
reason is that he setup a news gateway, whereby people can participate in
the PLUG list via NNTP. In order to do this he had to set things up so
that people can post to the list from outside of the list.

As for dealing with spam, Karl tells me that he wants a volunteer who has
experience working with spamassasin to set it up for PLUG.

Any volunteers please email karl at microsharp.com

Agreed! In fact, I just emailed Karl to ask him to shut if off globally 
for *each* list. I don't know what the heck he was thinking having that 
turned on.

Sean,

I'm not familiar with the "=" notation, but there's no need for the cat,
and this example only works if you're moving it to a local file system
or to one that's been NFS (or AFS or samba or whatever) mounted.

To move directories to a new host, you could do something like the
following:

cd /home
tar -cf - usera userb userc useretc | (ssh newhost "cd /home; tar -xvf -")

If you are using GNUtar at both ends, there are a bazillion options that
make this even nicer - the "-C directory" option will tar or untar
relative to "directory", so you could eliminate that "cd /home;" above.

Be sure the same user accounts and uids exist on the new machine before
you do this.

  I'm confused, Doug. /etc/cron.daily/ is a directory (as are the other
/etc/cron.*/). It contains:
cron.daily:
1postfix*        dailyscript*  makewhatis.cron*  tetex.cron*   tmpwatch*
check-packages*  logrotate*    slocate.cron*     tetex.cron.rpmorig*

  The run-parts daily script. /etc/cron.daily/dailyscript, has nothing about
logrotate in it.

  What do other RH installations have to rotate logs?

Thanks,

Rich

cron.daily ought to be a directory (at least on RH installs). What you have
there appears correct. Since `logrotate' is executable, it should be
triggered by run-parts (see /usr/bin/run-parts). What's in `logrotate'?
Hopefully...


[bigfish at kippered bigfish]$ cat /etc/cron.daily/logrotate
#!/bin/sh

/usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf

It shouldn't. The `run-parts' script runs any executable in the directory
given as an arg to the script. You can run it manually...

   /usr/bin/run-parts /etc/cron.daily

...or if you want to test just `logrotate', copy it to it's own directory
and pass that to `run-parts' as an arg. You can stick an `echo "I was here"'
before and after the `/usr/sbin/logrotate' to confirm that `run-parts' is
executing `logrotate'. If it is, then the problem is either with
`logrotate', or more likely, with what you've got in the .conf file.

Rich,

One other thought. Have you looked at root's email? You should be getting a
cron log (Subject: Cron <root@{HOSTNAME}> run-parts /etc/cron.daily) with
stdout and stderr of your cron jobs.

I think you're not understanding the mechanism of the /etc/cron.daily
(or .weekly, .monthly).  /etc/crontab has a line for each of these
directories that says "run-parts . . . /etc/cron.xxxxx"  each time this
command is run, all of the scripts in the corresponding directory are
executed.  Since you list a "logrotate" file in /etc/cron.daily, you
should look at the contents of that file to see what it is doing, or
possibly even manually execute the file to see if it will successfully
rotate your log files.

Sandy,

  Root's mail gets routed to me. Each day I get a copy of the run-parts
daily report. There's no sign that logrotate was invoked. The
dailyscript.conf calls for a review of logs, what packages changed and who
logged in. All of this was written for RH 4.1 and hasn't been updated or
copyright since 1997.

I've done this with Star Office(Writer) and it works 
well.  Though GIMP was the SW that I used to modify the 
images. (It worked better with the 6.0 Beta than the 5.2 
product.  I haven't looked at the release yet.)

Rich,

If you have the ImageMagick rpm installed you can use the convert command 
to annotate your pictures. Then just place them in your report document, 
or a blank page. This is probably not the easiest way to do it but I have 
found it a useful tool to remember. It can do all sorts of cool things 
with images.

Shannon,

  Very astute: I don't understand all that's going on here. :-)

  Your second suggestion may have identified the problem. I didn't see
anything wrong with the file (of course, as I don't know what I should
expect to see). So, I tried running it. Aha!

  The maillog script defines /var/log/maillog. There was another entry in
the syslog script that defined that file, too, and contained only a
post-rotate instruction. So, I moved that to the maillog script and removed
it from the syslog script. Then I learned that logrotate was trying to run
both named and named.rpmorig. Another log file name repeat. So, I've cleaned
that all up and logrotate ran manually.

  I'll know tomorrow morning if that was the problem. If so, there were no
error or warning messages to me to indictate any problem existed. Logrotate
just didn't run, I suppose.

  Thank you all very much. A follow up will be posted tomorrow.

Rich

Mark,

  Thanks very much. I occurred to me after I sent the message that I
*should* be able to do this in OpenOffice. It looks like I can. I suppose
that the strategy is to put all the images in one file and the text a
separate file. Then I can print the text on the laser printer (bond paper)
and the images on the color printer (glossy paper).

Keith,

  Convert to annotate? Wow! That's non-intuitive. What I want, though, are
captions, not annotations on the image itself.

Thanks,

Richard,

Have a look again at /etc/crontab.  There you will see that
cron fires up `run-parts' on each of cron.{daily,weekly,monthly,...}
at the appropriate time.  It's run-parts that does the important work
of running each of the scripts in the cron.{...} diretories.

Now edit $(which run-parts) and you will  see how it works.

Dean

  Thanks, Dean. Stepping back from the immediate problem allowed me to fit
all the pieces together.

  Is this all documented somewhere; e.g., in a system administration book or
something similar? I don't recall reading anything about the whole system of
logs and their rotation in all the books I've read.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0206071143540.18911-100000@lukem.com>

We currently have a system that is VERY EXPENSIVE (about $30k every other
year for licensing) that keeps a database of over a million scanned images
on an optical jukebox that are used for legal purposes by our company,
etc.  We'd like to explore using a home-grown solution to save money.  So
I've been asked to research this possibility.  There are about 1,500,000
images currently saved and there's a MS SQL 6.5 database that has info on
each image, such as an ID number, date, name, etc., and then a proprietary
Windows-only client program that accesses the database.

So here's my initial thought...  A web-based front-end that accesses a
MySQL database with the images stored on a large disk array.  I would like
a web-based front-end because about 30% of our company runs Linux on their
desktops, and they'll need access from time to time as well.  I'm leaning
towards MySQL simply because I'm the most familiar with it, but I'm not
sure how well it would handle 1.5 million records.  Has anyone had
experience with MySQL databases this large?  If MySQL is not the best
choice, then I'll gladly use whatever will do the best job.

Thank you for any feedback you might have.

The other thing to try is running the logrotate command manually with 
debug and verbose messaging enabled. I looked at my (non-RedHat) system 
and it has a little script called "logrotate" in /etc/cron.daily with 
the following command:

#!/bin/sh

/usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf

Make sure that your system's logrotate.conf file has an "include" 
directive that includes the /etc/logrotate.d directory. Should be 
something like:

include /etc/logrotate.d

In looking at the man page for "logrotate" a command of:

logrotate -dv /etc/logrotate.conf

will run "logrotate" in debug/verbose mode. I'm not sure if the file 
locations on my system are identical to a RedHat system but your setup 
sounds similar from reading your messages.

I don't want to get into holy war here, but based on everything I've read
about the implementation of MySQL, while it does fine for many things, it
still lacks full SQL support, and it has some holes in it's implementation
that will allow it to mess up your database while performing transactions.
Given the above, and the fact that PostgreSQL does provide a full SQL
implementation (which will probably make it easier to migrate to from
your old system) and correct handling for transactions, PostgreSQL is the
only free DB that I would use for commercial work.

I'm sure it's "somewhere" but I learned it the "hard way".  My logging
stopped working once (on a Solaris box) so I just started poking
around.  After seventeen or eighteen hours I had learned all about
syslog, log rotation, and a whole raft of other things which
eventually came in handy.

Search out every problem to it's foundation and refuse to apply
chewing-gum and bailing-wire solutions (unless there is simply no
other way) and you will learn a great deal.

Unfortunately my advice will cost you many hundreds of hours, will
mean that you can forget about taking family vacations, and will probably
lead to bankruptcy :-)

Well you might want to look at my post to the plug, in evolution I type
postgres, come back with all the treads. So spiffy. 

Our mail list should have a search !!!
https://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2002-May/003334.html


IMHO MySQL, is not the greatest database. 

It does not pass Mr Dodd ACID Test, only if you build with InnoDB.

Look into postgres, in some cases it was faster then MySql. 

MySQL has the habbit of not gracefully failing.

here read these links. 

http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/tim20000705.php3

MySQL VS Postgres by the TOR dude. 
http://www.webtechniques.com/archives/2001/09/jepson/



What I think it boils down to is MySQL rocks to snarf web logs, where
each item new entry into table.  Where MySQL is MS Access light. 80/20
rule, Where MySQL team only made fast what occurs 80% of the time, threw
out the rest. 

WOW  UNION is implemented in MySQL 4.0.0.
Wait , dev tree is only on 4.0.1. 

Postgres Rocks where you have many people playing with the same dataset
issuing updates. AKA 80 clients hitting the same row issuing updates.
Think of postgres as oracleGPL for the people. 


XFS. 

IMHO is the best journaling file system for linux. 

It has been design from the ground up to be a true journaling file
system. 

EXT3 is a hack, to ext2 to add journaling. 

JFS is not the JFS on AIX. 

It is from the source tree of Stale OS/2 JFS. So the development is not
the to the same level as the enterprise level as IBM AIX. 

http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/features.html

2^63 = 9 x 1018 = 9 exabytes.  or 9000 Terabytes I think :) 
That is alot of MP3. 

POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs)

The Linux XFS filesystem supports the ACL semantics and interfaces
described in the draft POSIX 1003.1e standard.

Maximum File Size

For Linux 2.4, the maximum accessible file offset is 16TB on 4K page
size and 64TB on 16K page size. As Linux moves to 64 bit on block
devices layer, file size limit will increase to 9 million terabytes (or
the system drive limits).



Hardware 

I would buy a new MPX Athlon with a dual 2, load up the ram. 

Buy a few Promise ATA 133 cards. 

For Best performance, no chaining the ide. aka 1 drive per each ide
cable.  

Loadup the ide, there is a new Wester Digital Driver with 2 or 4 megs of
cache. I think. 

Also I would do a nice raid 5. 

The hardware above is what I priced out for myself. 

was around 2,000 for 1/4 Terabyte. 


Also you want to see if the LVM, stuff works now. Aka not buggy.

Dean,

  You forgot to write that you prefer to work in TeX rather than LaTeX or
Lyx, code in assembler for each processor with which you need to work, and
insist on making your own water by smashing together two hydrogen atoms and
one oxygen atom, glass by glass.

  Note: the first I know is true; from what you wrote above, I assume the
rest.

There isn't a simpler regexp in emacs that will match that
exactly.  (This is emacs 20.7; I haven't looked at what
changes emacs 21 introduced yet.)

Hello,
We are using MySQL as a full blown production database in our company
for over two years. 
It has on average over 16,000,000 data rows per table and consists of
83 tables.
So far we have never experienced any problems with it. 
Recently we upgraded it to MySQL 4.0 Max to take a full advantage of
InnoDB tables which are ACID compliant and have foreign keys. 
The only one point we can't agree upon what to use for datafiles raw
partition or exsisting file system. 
 
Lets cut this crap off:

Nether your beloved PostgreSQL. 
When we tested it in our environment it was awfully slow, although,
reach in features most of which won't be used in normal operations
and can be easily substituted within API. 

> It does not pass Mr Dodd ACID Test, only if you build with InnoDB.

So what? Use MySQL with ACID compliant InnoDB tables. 

http://www.innodb.com/

It's always better to have a choice what table type (ISAM, MyISAM,
Gemini, BDB, InnoDB) use for your specific tasks,
than just stick with default table provided with PostgreSQL.

It has never been proven to be a true.

It's a rubbish.
Rather vice versa. PostgreSQL was failing in our test when it was
managed by persistently running FCGI API's emulating over 200
sumultaneous users.
MySQL was rock solid in the same test conditions.

Look at the dates of these publications first.
If somebody posted something on Internet it doesn't mean that

Don't go with WD they are crap. 
As a rule after three years WD fails unexpectably.
We had five of such occasions and we've lost a lot of data. 
Use IBM or Maxtor HD's but not WD,
especially for RAID applications.

Reliable but very sloooow on average about 4 MB/sec transfer rate on
the system with four ATA 100 HD's.

RAID0+1 configuration is good and reliable. About 33MB/sec 
Even better to use replication master slave on two independent RAID0
arrays on the same server. About 70MB/sec per RAID0 array.
This feature is natively supported in MySQL.

You're suggesting IBM drives because they are reliable?  Go googling for info 
on the IBM 75GXP...

I thought I read somewhere that IBM was getting out of the hard drive 
business, too.  Aparently consumers weren't the only ones to realize IBM 
drives are garbage.

I haven't heard such bad things about WD drives.  I would personally go with 
Seagate.  They seem to be of higher quality and performance.

  This is the base from which I've started. It's not working for me
(emacs-20.7-1). Doesn't work in 'joe', either, which uses emacs regex. Darn!

  Here, Dean, is the perfect way to spend a few hours on something that
should be a 30-second task. :-) I've almost 800 records in this file, and
each record can have from 1 to 5 telephone numbers. I don't want to pluck
them all out by hand, one-by-one.

  What could be simpler, eh? But, it's not working.

  Sigh. So much for getting this report out the door today. I'll have to
finish it tomorrow.

Whenever I get hung up using any given editor's regexen, I usually sent
whatever chunk I'm working on through an external filter whose syntax
I'm very familiar with (for me, usually Perl).

Maybe a quick look through emacs docs will tell you how to do that?

I only followed the thread casually, so don't know the exact details,
but if you'd restate exactly what you want, I know I could write a
script that would do it.

   However, ... I just discovered that I *could* do this in joe, but not
emacs! Before, I was putting the quotation marks in the search string,
surrounding the long string of digit categories (a la Felix's message), and
the attempts failed.

  This time, I tried without the quotation marks and it worked. So, why not
in emacs? Shrug. That's an exercise I'll work on during my next vacation.

  FWIW, I believe that you're all correct -- depending on which model drive.
I've used only WD (and one Maxtor) since my Seagate ST-225. Nary a problem.
But, ... I learned that some WD models were pigs and to avoid those. From
what I've read in the past, this is true for each manufacturer.

YMMV,

  All strings are within double quotes and fields are separated by commas.

  I used Esc-x replace-string, then entered the search string, pressed
[Enter] then entered either a space or nothing before pressing [Enter]
again. Emacs responded with "no occurrences found".

That'd be your problem right there.  You want M-x replace-regexp, not
replace-string. 

Rich, if you started out by telling us what you actually did, we could
converge on a solution much more rapidly.

I am happy to report that Accelerated Learning Center is going to be 
offering a Linux Networking course this July. I am definately going to 
sign up for this course. Ed Sawicki, the instructor, tells me that he 
needs at least 6 people to sign up for the course to go forward. For that 
reason he wants to schedule the course on the most convenient days 
possible. This course will be taught by Ed Sawicki, an experienced 
instructor who has worked in the computer industry since the early 1970s.

Here is the curriculum of the course: 
http://alcpress.com/training/courses/linuxnetworking.htm

ALC is offering this course at $320, which is significantly less than the 
$595 for which they usually offer it.

The course will either be three weekdays or three Saturdays.

1. Are there people on this list who would sign up for this course? 

2. If you are interested would you rather attend three weekdays or three 
Saturdays during July?

I will report back to ALC what I learn. I hope some other people join me 
in signing up for this course so it can go forward.

In addition, Ed Sawicki is also teaching a Linux OS course at PCC. This 
course will cover the basics of the Linux OS and Linux System 
Administration:

When I run Redhat 7.3 installer it only sees the CHS drive size of 8G
(1027 Cyl, not 1024 BTW).

I cannot seem to convince Redhat's boot process to look at the LBA data.

Oddly, the Vaio is the first Bios that listed the CHS (Cyl Head Sector)
differently then the LBA.

I tried

linux linear
linux lba
linux lba32
linux ide=lba
linux ide=lba32

Any ideas?  I have never had to care about LBA/CHS before......

I know *nothing* about redhat, but have you tried telling linux the
actual geometry.  I had to do this once years ago on a 486 when I
installed a 6 gig drive the BIOS writers had never dreamed was
possible.  There used to be a way to do this via boot options I
think.

That won't scale.
That's been proven to be O(N^2) and we need a solution that's O(NlogN).
There are, of course, various export limitations on that technology.
The syntax is idiosyncratic.
Trying to build a team behind that technology would be a staffing nightmare.
That can't be generalized to a cross-platform build.
Unfortunately, the license would contaminate our product.
If we go with that idea, we're going to have Don Marti camped out in the
front lobby with 300 angry software jihad supporters.
Our support infrastructure simply can't handle the volume that change would
involve.
I had one of the interns try that approach for another project, and it
scrambled the CEO's hard drive. So I think it's going to be a hard sell.
Yes, well, that's just not the way things work in the real world.
I like your idea. Why don't you write up a white paper and we'll review it
at the next staff meeting?
Unfortunately, we're an all-FORTH shop. Otherwise, it's a nice idea.
I think you need to stop taking this so personally. We need to think about
what's best for the project, not about our own little pet theories.
Oh, I played with that approach back as an undergrad. Got a D, too.
I was reading about that on BugTraq yesterday.
Yes, I believe that's the approach Windows NT is taking.
That's totally inefficient on modern hardware.
Well, yes, but it really reduces to the knapsack problem in that case. Do
you have some kind of heuristic, or are we dealing with an NP-complete case?
Have you LOOKED at the number of I/O requests that will create?
We can't afford the transaction overhead.
Yeah, or we could all just plink away on Amigas or something.
What? I don't speak your crazy moon-language.
Hmm. Didn't they just go bankrupt? It's OK, I guess -- there's some German
company who's picked up the existing service contracts.
No, no, no. We're really working on an N-TIER architecture, here.
No, no, no. It's fairly important that the database be in THIRD NORMAL FORM.
No, that would break object encapsulation.
I don't think that's altogether clear. Please write it up in UML for me.
I think there's a problem with your drive geometry.
Can you generate some USE CASES that would justify the change?
How is that going to impact the schedule?
RAM is cheap and all, but...
It would probably be best if we deferred that until version 2.0.
I like it, but it is too point-oh for my tastes.
If you make this change, I will fork the code.
Yes, well, unfortunately the economy is going away from anything remotely
like that. Our investors would kill us.
Jakob Nielsen wrote an interesting hit piece on that.
Yes, yes, we've all read DJB's RFCs on the subject.
This is all covered in Knuth, and we don't have time to go over it again.
This one is in the FAQ:
http://www.linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/#your_dumb_technology
I don't have time for this extropian nonsense.
Well, I guess we could start the QA cycles again from square one. That would
require a press release, though.
You used to program in Pascal, didn't you?
Why don't we make a generalized solution including both options, and let the
administrator decide with a config-file setting?
You've obviously ignored the various namespace issues.
I don't think you're considering the performance trade-offs.
What kind of benchmarks have you been running?
Let's table this for now, and we'll talk about it one-on-one off-line.
This really doesn't jibe with our core competency.
This sort of thing should really be outsourced.
I remember that IBM had a project to do that back in the 70s.
Um, hello? We're using VON NEUMANN MACHINES HERE.
We need this to fit on a single floppy.
Yes, but can this be embedded in a toaster, for example?
We need something that my mom can use.
Users won't want to click through that many layers of hierarchy.
The packaging costs will be prohibitive.
OK, but what about internationalization?
Look, would you just get off your Be obsession for FIVE MINUTES and talk
serious design with us?
That's a good idea -- you should do that on your home page.
Yeah, Linuxcare tried that with the Sourceror project.
Ho, man! Are they still AROUND? That's so cool. I thought that whole idea
was discredited years ago.
What you're not seeing is the difference between an 'is-a' and a 'has-a'
relationship.
There is no hope for the widow's son, Boaz.
Yes, but we're standardizing on XML.
That doesn't fit into the MVC model.
Well, that's great if you have an AI running the thing.
Well, they're going to do that with the next version of Perl, so we should
probably wait.
Well, they're going to do that with the next version of OS X, so we should
probably wait.
I heard that the only real application for that technology was child
pornography. How did you hear about it?

As a database administrator for a rather large company, I can understand the
concern about the licensing costs.  It is an ongoing battle with management.
They want it cheap, reliable and recoverable.  As the old saw goes, you can
have two out of three.

We too have legal documents.  We do NOT have the option of losing even one
record.  Never, never, never lose a record.  That rules out cheap.  We run
Oracle and SQL Server in various releases.  Moving to a shareware/freeware
database simply would not be allowed.

That said, other places I have worked would have let me do literally
anything I wanted.  However, decisions like this would have been a 'You bet
your job' decision.  As a computer professional my first obligation is to
protect the data of my company.  If MySql allows this to happen and saves
$30K go for it.  If there is even the remotest doubt that you could
completely recover (as in tested under all possible scenarios before going
production), then pay the $30K and pass the blame to the vendor if an
unrecoverable disaster occurs.

Management pays me good money, sends me to at least one conference a year
and a couple of classes without complaint because things just work all the
time every time.  It doesn't hurt to remind them once in awhile that some
new feature I learned saved them a bundle.

If you can't have proven reliability and recoverability - skip the move to
something new.

This is a touchy subject to some, my last post was a recap of what I
posted before, with some edits to incorporate some of Alex's opines. 

I was lazy did not add too much. 

I think we are getting into the area of VI VS Emacs holly war. 


I have no love for either MySql or Postgres. The trick is to know when
is the right choice for ether. 

Each database has their good points, but I was just trying to wrap up
what I said before, and others have said before. We are all enslave to
our past experiences with any product. If a product failed for us, and
was a nightmare to deal with. That Clouds our view on that product. 

Yes I know the links that I provided are dated, but the design
philosophy does not have major changes threw the years. 

Look at 
	Unix VS NT 
	BSD IP stack , vs Linux. 
        Linux SMP , vs BSD SMP. 
	Emacs , vs VI 

Postges VS MySQL
http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.mmlabx.ua.es/mysql-postgres.html&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dpostgres%2Bvs%2Bmysql%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D
Postges VS MySQL
http://www.webtechniques.com/archives/2001/09/jepson/

Hell I wished there was a lab that kept up to date performance numbers. 
I wish that Linux Lab would have 60 GB raid array , that would have up
to data base bench marks on Mysql vs Postgres. There is none so  that
leaves us with old data. 

But there is hope, 
OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPMENT LAB ANNOUNCES LINUX DATABASE TEST TOOL AVAILABLE
TO OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY
http://www.osdlab.org/osdlpress/2002_may_16_beaverton.html

Your best bet is to setup a testenv , and play around with things :) 
This is what the LinuxJournal did with Oracle, 
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5841

http://www.quest.com/benchmark_factory/

I would set up some win 98 boxes to pound on your linux box. 
And a NT/w2k/xp box to run the benchmark. 

Mysql, Postgres have MS ODBC drivers. 

You might want to setup some boxes, to pound your database. 

Your co-worker boxes, yes use the extra cycles.

I answered Alex question last month, here is the recap. 

 ReiserFS if memory severed rocked at itty bity files. 

Have you looked at the # of patches that come out for ReiserFS ?? 
http://www.namesys.com/download.html

These types of messages do not give me warm fuzzy, when it comes to my
data. 
----------------------------------------------------------
CAUTION
WARNING
1. Don't use linux kernel 2.4.16 or earlier for reiserfs operations, as
many of those releases contain critical bugs, some of the most serious
of which are not in reiserfs but affect reiserfs. 2.4.16, 2.4.9, and
2.4.3 are especially bad. The SuSE release of 2.4.16 is ok, it contains
some needed patches. 2.4.18 is the latest release at the time of
writing, and it said to be solid and reliable.
2. For linux kernel 2.5.6 or 2.5.7 you need an additional patch that
will allow the use of reiserfs: 01-revert_broken_alviro_cleanup.diff
----------------------------------------------------------


Here are some bonie runs , with ext2,ext3 jfs, xfs. 
 
http://oss.software.ibm.com/pipermail/jfs-discussion/2001-October/000687.html

RAID + LVM + Journaled File System + Oracle + TPC-C and AS3AP SQL
benchmarks. 
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5841

http://www.linuxjournal.com/modules/NS-articles/style/5841f3.jpg
Table 1. AS3AP Transaction Benchmark Results

ext2 345 289 474 1,108 254 0.205
ext3 230 127 221 578 252 0.208
Reiser 371 291 1,029 1,691 250 0.210
IBM JFS 350 282 462 1,094 253 0.207
RAW 396 290 442 1,128 196 0.369
 
http://www.linuxjournal.com/modules/NS-articles/style/5841f4.jpg

Table 2. TPC-C Transaction Benchmark Results

RAW X 2 396 240 263 899 2.753 0.050

So Alex, if you look at lj bechmark for Riserfs it comes in dead last
for TPC-C and AS3AP. 

EXT3 Kicked it ass, I just wished there was an xfs part of the
benchmark. 

EXT3 beat out raw file system too. 

Is this benchmark, use able for you ?? 

It is oracle, yes , but it does stress out a RDMS, so these should show
some light on other RDMS other then oracle, when it comes to file system
performance. 

EXT3 even beat out raw file system.

Subject: [PLUG] Ethereal problems
Message-ID: <1023500768.2947.15.camel@red>

For those of you that use Ethereal for troubleshooting network
protocols, be aware that it will sometimes decode the wrong
protocol. For example, the last time I started one of my DNS
servers (BIND8 on an old Red Hat 6.X box)) it chose an ephemeral
port of 1745 to use when sending recursive queries to other DNS
servers. Ethereal interprets these packets as the "MSproxy"
protocol instead of the DNS protocol.

These UDP packets use 1745 for the source port and 53 as the
destination port. It seems that Ethereal looks at the source
port first and if it finds a port relating to a protocol it
knows how to decode, it goes with that regardless of what the
destination port is. This is clearly the wrong thing to do
because 1745 is only a registered port but 53 is a well-known
port. A well-known port (1-1023) should always trump a registered
port (1024 an up). This is far more likely to be correct than the
reverse.

Me me! I was already thinking of asking Ed what it would take to do a course

Days don't matter, weekdays preferred. Ed is a very good teacher, as anyone 
who has attended a Biz Nix meeting knows.

Excellent! From the interest so far, I can tell that getting enough people 
interested for Ed and ALC to run the course will be no problem.

I am considering the RHCE training and certification, has anyone out

paper helped them?  I know this isn't the best time to ask, in the midst
of recession and layoffs, however with Linux starting to gain more

I got my RHCE last November (RH7.2). My employer paid for the one week
course and exam - otherwise I wouldn't have it. The training did help to
fill in a few holes, but it's mainly a refresher - don't expect to be able
to pass the exam if you have little prior experience with linux (Red Hat in
particular). It's more a validation of what you know than a learning
experience.

I think it was time well spent - and has helped me on the job. But I don't
know how much value it would have in terms of landing a new job. My employer
saw value in sending me and 5 of my cow-orkers in terms of marketing and
sales being able to hype the number of engineers that are certified (we're
all certifiable ;-).

My only problem is the course load I'm already taking.
But if I had free time, it would be filled with Ed's course.

The advantage of doing this with gimp is you can match the color and
gamma of the screen with your printout, so that even if you enhance the
image it will look right when printed.  The results are not
distinguishable from photographs (not by the layperson at least).  

You could easily paste your image onto a slightly larger canvas in gimp,
and use the outer white area to render whatever text and caption you

My previous employer went to NC and got his certification right after it was
released.  He was the first RHCE in Oregon. He did it mainly as a marketing
tool for the company.  According to him, you better have a pretty good
understanding of RedHat if you want to pass.  If you can find a company that
is looking for RHCE's, it is definately worth it.  But the MCSE overload has
soured the industry on certifications as a whole.

  Thank you, Kevin.

  I'm not doing art for art's sake, but illustrating technical reports that
will be read once -- if we're lucky -- then filed away somewhere, never
again to see the light of day. Such is bureaucracy. (Is 'bureaucracy' a
singular or a collective noun?)

  The OpenOffice solution works, too.

Sorry for the "urgent" but, well, it's urgent.

I need to use `rsh' as root to accomplish a task.

Aside: please --- no lectures on the security risks involved; I'm fully
                  aware of these.  To put your minds at rest: the task is
                  to be performed in a completely
                  closed env. and after it's done rsh will be removed
                  from the system.  

I've installed `in.rshd' on a mandrake 8.2 system (hostname == `medulla')
I need to do a sequence of root --> root remote command executions
like (as root on pons):

      rsh medulla cmd_1
      rsh medulla cmd_2 ...

In which data will flow between the machines.

I have put  a `.rhosts' file in the root dir. of medulla and
a lone `rsh medulla' gets me a root prompt so I know that the
basic communications ports are all working.

But when I do `rsh medulla cmd'  I get either:

"permission denied"  or "Connection refused" as elaborated below.

Here is my current /etc/xinetd.d/rsh file on medulla:

     # default: off
     # description: The rshd server is the server for the rcmd(3) routine and, \
     #	consequently, for the rsh(1) program.  The server provides \
     #	remote execution facilities with authentication based on \
     #	privileged port numbers from trusted hosts.
     service shell
     {
             socket_type		= stream
             wait			= no
             user			= root
             log_on_success		+= USERID
             log_on_failure 		+= USERID
             server			= /usr/sbin/in.rshd -h -L
             disable			= no
     }    


Note the `-h' flag on the server line.  Without it I get the
"permission denied" message on pons.   The `rshd' man page says
that without the flag I can't execute remote commands so this is expected.

When I add the flag I get the "Connection refused" message.
I don't see anything in /var/log/messages or /var/log/auth.log
which helps.

I suspect that PAM is somehow involved in this problem.

Here is my current /etc/pam.d/rsh file on medulla:


    #%PAM-1.0
    # For root login to succeed here with pam_securetty, "rsh" must be
    # listed in /etc/securetty.
    auth       required	/lib/security/pam_nologin.so
    auth       required	/lib/security/pam_securetty.so
    auth       required     /lib/security/pam_env.so
    auth       required     /lib/security/pam_rhosts_auth.so
    account    required	/lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth
    session    required	/lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth


As always, any help in getting this to work will be appreciated.
And, of course I'm in a huge hurry as I'm leaving on a business trip
and need to have this working before I go.

Here's a link that talks about how to setup rsh, including adding entries
to /etc/securetty (which may be all you need):

What bootloader? I had no difficulties getting LILO to work happily with
a 10GB drive in my ancient Gateway P166 laptop (under RH 7.0). I'm not
sure how it would behave now that they seemed to have switched to GRUB,
as I've since installed a BIOS overlay from IBM (necessary to get
Windoze to accept the drive). Contrary to popular expectation, I've had
no problems at all with the BIOS overlay.

Thanks Matt but this will not help.  (I tried it and it doesn't).

I'm not trying to login to medulla's root account.  I'm trying to
execute remote commands via `rsh'.  The advice on the web page
is for allowing root login via rlogin.   (rsh w/o commands == rlogin, by
the way.)

Since I have a `.rhosts' file in the root dir. of medulla, I can already
login w/o the additions to /etc/securetty and without a password---which
is what is required to execute remote commands.

So I'm still in the hole.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.
My flight time approaches.

Keep shooting.  Maybe next time you'll hit something.
I just tried putting `pons' in /etc/hosts.equiv.  Same response:
Also tried `+'.  No dice:


[root at pons /root]# rsh medulla /bin/ls
medulla: Connection refused
[root at pons /root]# 

Note that I already have an `.rhosts' in the /root directory of 
medulla which contains "pons" as its only entry.  This makes
a lone `rsh medulla'  instantly return a medulla root command prompt.

But `rsh medulla cmd' gives the above.  I even (without knowing
what I'm really doing) changed every line in `/etc/pam.d/rsh' from

#%PAM-1.0
# For root login to succeed here with pam_securetty, "rsh" must be
# listed in /etc/securetty.
auth       required	/lib/security/pam_nologin.so
auth       required	/lib/security/pam_securetty.so
auth       required     /lib/security/pam_env.so
auth       required     /lib/security/pam_rhosts_auth.so
account    required	/lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth
session    required	/lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth

to


#%PAM-1.0
# For root login to succeed here with pam_securetty, "rsh" must be
# listed in /etc/securetty.
auth       required	/lib/security/pam_permit.so
auth       required	/lib/security/pam_permit.so

auth       required     /lib/security/pam_permit.so
account    required	/lib/security/pam_permit.so
session    required	/lib/security/pam_permit.so


As I said, I'm shooting from  the hip here as well.  It didn't work.

I also tried doing `msec 0' on medulla (always restarting "xinetd", just
for fun) which basiclly changes the "security level"
of the machine to "Crackers Welcome".
Again no dice.

Nothing works.  Very frustrating.  I've now been here at work for 4
hours to accomplish a task that should have taken 45 minutes (and I
haven't even started on the task!!).

Linux: the ultimate love-hate relationship.

Nothing.

If I do `rsh medulla' so that I get logged in, this fact appears
in these files as, e.g.:

Jun  8 14:48:44 medulla xinetd[29262]: USERID: login OTHER :root
Jun  8 14:48:44 medulla xinetd[29170]: START: login pid=29262 from=pons.enet.sharplabs.com

OK, I just setup rsh from the RPM and got it working.  I enabled
/etc/xinetd.d/rsh, /etc/xinetd.d/rlogin, and /etc/xinetd.d/rexec.  I then created
/etc/hosts.equiv and /root/.rhosts and put in the computer name which is
defined in /etc/hosts.  Next, I added rsh, rlogin, and rexec

hosts involved.

Matt, would you mind sending me (in private e-mail) your phone number?

I'll call you as soon as I get it and maybe on the phone
we can get the thing to work.


Thanks,

I just got off the phone with Matt Alexander who successfully
helped me fix my tricky `rsh' problem.  Thanks a million Matt.

It turns out that the man page (for rshd) is wrong where it says:

     8.   Rshd then validates the user using ruserok(3),  which uses the file
          /etc/hosts.equiv and the .rhosts file found in the user's home di?
          rectory. The -l option prevents ruserok(3) from doing any validation
          based on the user's ``.rhosts'' file (unless the user is the supe?
          ruser and the -h option is used.) If the -h option is not used, su?
          peruser accounts may not be accessed via this service at all.

Note the double negative in the last sentence.

In fact supplying the -h flag seems to inhibit rshd from ever allowing
remote command execution (as root or otherwise).  Also Matt's original
comment regarding an entry in /etc/securetty is correct, thought you
only need an entry for `rsh'.  When I tried his suggestion I had the
-h flag on the daemon and so it appeared that his suggestion made no
difference.

Note that had I  not read the manual I never would have added the -h flag
and all would  have been well.

The fractured moral of this tale of a wasted Saturday is

        "Don't read the manual and everything will be OK".

I was thinking of lobbying Ed and ALC to offer some of the other courses

offering things like their DNS Bootcamp, Apache, Firewalls, etc., only in 
places like Denver and Chicago but not Portland. And I bet we could get a 
much better price locally.

Ed was enthusiastic about offering the Linux Networking course. I bet that 
he would offer another course or two this summer if there were sufficient 
interest.

Take a look at what they offer and let me know if you would sign up if 
something on this list were offered: http://alcpress.com/training/

If a number of people express interest then I will ask Ed if he will
consider scheduling the course.

Do we have some interest in any of the other courses?

I've never heard of ALC before and they don't seem to have much 
information on their website.
How much credability do they have? (I notice the site has some broken 
links, too)

Not to sound rude, but it seems these courses are rather bland and can 
be learned by reading a book.
How much hands-on experience are they providing?

We just had a discussion on the list about the Linux Networking course, 
and several people said that they are interested in taking the course. 
Considering that I sent the email on a Friday afternoon, it got a pretty 
decent response and I bet a few more will express interest next week.

Several people have told me that Ed Sawicki (who teaches many ALC courses) 
is an excellent teacher and excellent teachers are hard to find. People 
have told me that the ALC courses have been useful. That is good enough 
for me.

If you are not interested in the courses, why bother responding to this 
email? I want to get some people interested in taking a few courses this 
summer so the courses will run.

The courses involve some lecture, some demo, and some hands-on. I don't 
know the exact proportions of each.

As for books vs. courses, anything can be learned from a book. I got a 
Bachelor's degree. Could I have learned everything I learned in college 
through indepedent reading? Probably, but I am glad I went to college and 
would do it again no question. I like learning from an instructor. To many 
people it is useful to have a knowledgeable person guiding the learning 
process, answering questions, etc. Also, it can be fun.

If you are not interested in courses you are of course free to not 
participate...

I agree. I think that we should let David Mandel and Karl Hegbloom know
that we do not like the way the lists are configured right now:

1. Few people (if any) use the news gateway, so let's kill that and go
back to a configuration *not* allowing non-subscribers to send to the
lists. This needs to be changed for *each* list.

2. As it stands now, you can change your individual mailman config to be
invisible on the subscriber list. This is easy to do and I recommend that
anyone who values their privacy, take a minute and do so. That's in the
mean time. Soon, very soon, I would like the list config for *each* list
changed so the subscriber list is not available to anyone (subscriber or
not). Granted the format of the list is not very useful as is but a
determined spammer could use the lists.

Since we are a somewhat democratic organization, I think that more than I
should let karl at microsharp and dmandel at microsharp.com know our opinions on
this matter. I have done so but my opinion alone is not enough. Do others
agree with me that these lists should be tightened up?

Let's get on the stick and tighten up the list config.

Well, in places in like Boston, Denver, and Philadelphia the Linux
Networking course is $595. Here in Portland it is $325. I guess that is
because ALC is local but I am not sure if that is why or not. BTW, I
mis-reported the price of the Linux Networking course as $320 earlier when
it is actally $325.

As for the other courses, I can only extrapolate that we here in Portland
would get some kind of discount. How much would be up to Ed and ALC.
Considering that a text is included, I consider the $325 pretty
reasonable.

I might have created a wrong impression here. The only thing available
to subscribers that is a concern, is the subscriber list *not* any sort of
private config info.

For example, if you want to view the plug subscriber list you would get a
list with emails in this sort of format:

neil at pacifier.com

It is purposely formated that way to prevent spam harvesting,
nevertheless, I don't like having these lists available at all. It is
probably harmless to have the list available to subcribers especially in
this format but, as I said, a determined evildoer (spammer) could do some
evil with such lists.

Having not taken many computer classes before... are they all this (~$350?) 
expensive?

$1240 per term for tuition is more than enough to budget for learning at this 
time.

Well, this Linux Networking course is $325. I will ask Ed this week how
much the other ALC courses are when held in Portland.

I don't think $325 is expensive. I just looked at New Horizons Computer
Learning Center and they charge $1,595 for what I think is a week long
course. That is $319/day. ALC is charging $320 for a three day course.
That is about $108/day. In both cases that would be eight hour days. I
think ALC is offering a pretty decent price for this course here locally.

Ed says that they will most likely spread the days out so you have time to
absorb the material, study, practice what you learned, etc. So I think
this means that there would be three full day sessions spread out over
three weeks. You'd have a week between each session. Personally, I feel
pretty enthusiastic about this course and I really hope ALC offers more
courses as well.

Hey, if you are a full-time student then you certainly have your hands
full and you might as well focus your full energy on getting that done.

I'm hoping to avoid unnecessary pitfalls of setting up a small
network.

I have a DSL connection with a 2 Linux PCs, and will soon add a
Thinkpad and a printer. I'll need some kind of switch to link
everything up. Any ideas as to what they cost, what features I
need to keep an eye out for, as well as advices on who makes good
(bad!) switches? I'm guessing I'll probably see the best

Thanks,

Well, I don't know that much about them other than the fact that several
people have told me that ALC and Ed in particular do a good job of
teaching. As anyone who has taken courses knows, it is really hit or miss
on instructors.

In college, I'd say that about 40% of my instructors were terrible, 40%
were just mediocre, and another 20% were really good. I have not yet taken
a course from Ed but people tell me he is in the really good category.

It is an interesting question as to what makes an instructor bad. I have
had very, very, very knowledgeable instructors who were terrible. Why?
They were so focused on other things (e.g., research) that they did not
put much time into course preparation. They were really smart but had the
communication skills of a tree frog. They had some obscure or discredited
viewpoint they wanted to push at every opportunity. In some cases they
possesed all three of these charming traits.

The worst professor I ever had was for a history course. The course was
supposed to be about the Progressive Era of U.S. history but instead the
professor did nothing but push dime-store Marxism. We learned nothing at
all about the Progressive Era (~1879-1920).

What makes an instructor good? Usually they have some combination of good
subject knowledge, prepare thoroughly for each session, really enjoy
teaching, and have strong enthusiasm for the subject. Also, there are some
intangibles that make an instructor good. With some instructors it just
clicks.

Most will work a-okay.  Some have loud fans, some have no fans.  To me, 
quite is best.  Don't think they're available at Fry's, but the Intel 
InBusiness line of hubs and switches work fine and meet my dB criteria.

When I bought my 8-port switch it was cheaper than the 8-port hub.  You 
probably want a switch unless you have a good reason for having a hub. 
(Packet sniffing is better with a hub, but performance is generally better 
with a switch.)

As far as features go, unless you get into managed hubs/switches, they are 
all similiar.  I'd go for 8 ports at least, your setup will need 5 all 
ready.  10/100 gives you flexibility.  I have some hubs/switches that are 
soley one or the other and they sit unused.

I disagree.  I like the option of a news gateway and I think a few pieces
of spam for a few days or weeks until the filter is in place is a totally
reasonable price to pay for the availability of diverse list access
methods.

I think it's best to leave the configuration open and let users modify
their own configuration as they choose.

If the list is set to not provide user lists, then it will not provide
user lists regardless of the will of the individual subscribers.  Whereas,
if the list does provide user lists, it will only provide a list of users
that have chosen or failed to opt out of the list.

Clearly the current configuration is the most flexible.

I understand that it does a poor job of accomodating the lazy, but I don't
think that's the list admin's job.

Something like that would be good for your needs.

It isn't anything fancy (something with an OS), but it will serve you 
well - plus look at the price.
Unless I need something ASAP I try to save money by buying from ebay or 
"online" stores (ala pricewatch.com)

How many people actually use the news gateway? I bet almost nobody. It is
useful to have diverse list access methods if they are used but most
people just prefer either the regular list or the digest.

Why have the list open? What purpose does it serve? If you have a
compelling reason then I am willing to listen.

Most people, I think, assume that the list is closed by default. I assumed
that when I subsribed. I personally admin a majordomo list (for another
organization) and have the list closed and I think the users appreciate
that. Frankly, I was surprised to learn that the list was not closed.

I suppose in an ideal situation, you'd have mabey two separate security
classes, the first being a general overview of security concepts, an
intro to security for Linux / Unix, while the other class would be
"Advanved System Security" that went beyond basic security concepts,
delving into the nuts and bolts of recent attacks, the nuts and bolts of
how to prevent such attacks, wireless security issues, etc.

Elaborate? I'm too lazy to elaborate, aparently.

I started the thread to make a request to return to the "old" way. I just like 
the idea that those who posted here were a part of "us", not just anybody who 
could sneak through whatever filters.

Maybe using a newsreader is important. I don't know enough to decide, it was a 
request. I'm not the admin, I don't make decisions.

I've been real happy with an 8 port Linksys workgroup switch I got for 
my home network. The cost of the switch was less than $70.00. I paid 
way more for an 8 port 3Com 100BaseTX hub 4 years ago. The switch 
increased the throughput of my network quite a bit with the replacement 
of the hub with the switch. 

I have a gateway/firewall Linux system that does IP Masquearding so my 
switch isn't fancy. I know that Linksys has other routers that do DHCP 
and NAT for DSL or Cable modems so the connection can be shared among 
multiple systems.

Yes, the list was closed and I think we should have been informed of a 
policy change like that. And yes I agree with you that the list should go 
back to being closed.

On the other hand, I would not worry about it too much. To get the list 
you would have to subscribe and the list is not in a format that can 
easily be harvested and used by a spammer. The other thing is that as it 
stands now, you can change your own config to be invisible on the list. 
This is easy to do.

That said, I feel very strongly that either the list should be closed or 
the admin should have announced a change in policy. That way, people could 
have made the choice to be visible or not.

Stuart,
I would think that just getting a router with built-in print server
would be the easiest way to go. I myself use a 4 port 3COM DSL router
that has a built-in print server and it works very well. I did have
trouble getting it to run the way it was supposed to so I just have the
DSL modem hooked into as if it is another computer. I'm running 2 Linux
and a Win98 at my desk and 2 others in different parts of the house. All
can print to the Epson printer that I have hooked up to the router.
Saved me from having to have my computer on 24/7 just so that everyone
else could get online and print.


I'm hoping to avoid unnecessary pitfalls of setting up a small
network.

I have a DSL connection with a 2 Linux PCs, and will soon add a
Thinkpad and a printer. I'll need some kind of switch to link
everything up. Any ideas as to what they cost, what features I
need to keep an eye out for, as well as advices on who makes good
(bad!) switches? I'm guessing I'll probably see the best
selection at Fry's??

Thanks,

Stuart

For unmanaged switches/hubs the two big low-cost brands are Linksys and
NetGear.  I've used both quite a bit and have been very happy with NetGear
(formerly Bay Networks).

I have seen a number of strange failures on the Linksys (hubs that weren't
really hubs-- not all traffic was echoed to all ports, intermittent
failures, poor 100BaseT-to-10BaseT buffering, etc.)  The NetGear has been
much more consistent for some fairly heavy use.

I have heard good things on the Linksys from people I trust, so my
experiences might be somewhat unusual.

A good place to get and share opinions on hardware like this is

For a home network, you won't usually notice the difference between a hub 
and a switch, especially if you are just printing and sharing an Internet 
connection.  Therefore, if price is an issue, just go with a hub.  A switch 
-will- give you some increased reliability, especially if a NIC on your LAN 
happens to go bad and start spewing junk onto the wire.

Uh, Neil, how do you know what most people prefer?

I have used the news gateway.  It was handy when I was investigating
an intermittent failure in the chain of mail delivery by comparing
what was visible on the news server with what I had received in my
mailbox.

Also, it was suggested to someone (a longtime contributor) recently
who was leaving the immediate area and was going to be at the end of a
narrow phone wire and didn't want to subscribe to the mailing list
with its volume but wanted to check in from time to time.  A newsgroup
would allow him to select the messages to read.

I think the news gateway is valuable.

I bet that maybe one or two people use it regularly and a few more people 
have used it once or twice like you. I would be happy to be proven wrong 
on that point, that in fact many people use the news gateway.

But is something that benefits a very small number of people only slightly 
worth causing problems for several hundred other people? It deserves an 
informal cost/benefit analysis.

Frankly, I am tired of talking about this. I have expressed my opinion 
that the list config should be tightened up in a couple different ways, 
this being one of the ways. This one I don't think is as important as 
turning off 'who'.

I think it deserves a _real_ cost/benefit analysis.  Your "bets" don't
really get us any closer to that.

It doesn't matter how many people use it.

The real matter is whether or not (or how) we can prevent spam from coming
to the list, agreed?

So how about we get let Karl (or his delegate) get spamassassin running
and we can keep the news gateway.  I think we can all stand a spam or two
a day until we clear it up.  Hell, I'm sure each of us ignores that many
of the messages that are SUPPOSED to make it to the list each day.  (I,
for one, pretty much hit 'd' as soon as I see a line that begins "rpm -".)

Let's define some terms (since we've lost a bit in quotes out of context).  
By "leave the configuration open", I meant leaving the list configured
such that member addresses are available to other members by individual
member's choice.

What you're advocating is removing that choice and making all member
addresses unavailable.

Can you really not imagine a situation where a person would WANT their
subscribed address available to other subscribers?

> Most people, I think, assume that the list is closed by default.

Neil, you make the claim that "most people" think like you far too often
for it to hold any credibility whatsoever.

I don't mean this to be a personal attack or the start of a flame-fest,
but I find it odd that you're all for personal choice and freedom until
it's inconvenient (and then you're all for dictatorship, albeit sometimes
dictatorship of the majority).

Simply stating that you believe most people think this or that doesn't
mean anything.  Hopefully you can make your case without appealling to
false authority.

OK, so you were surprised.  Then, I assume, you went and removed your
address from the publicly available list.  So what's the problem?

If we make a global change, then NOBODY will have the option of making
their subscribed address public.  That would be a case of you imposing
your will and expectations on others.  So even if don't buy the argument
that some people might actually want to make their address available, you
should at least be able to see that your request is in conflict with your
own professed ideology.

I concur. When we start getting porn spam, the value of having the news
server is overruled I think. Who here is actually using the news server?
Maybe a compromise would be to have a read-only news gateway?

Last week, I attended the SANS institutes "Hacker Exploits, Techniques,
and Incident Handling" course here in Portland given by Ed Stoudis. It
was really excellent and I recommend it to anyone who has a chance to
attend. It covered both incident handling as well as exploits and had a
hands on portion that allowed us to try and crack into the 5 servers he
had available. ( I cracked all the Linux boxen and even got root on
one..Yay me!) I'm preparing an hour long presentation for work I'm
calling "Anatomy of a Network Attack". I'm going to show a sample attack
including a buffer overflow and some password cracking. I think it will
be really educational to people to demonstrate how easy it is to get
into a network as well as demonstrate the value of strong password as
well as applying regular patches. Would there be any interest from the
group in hearing my presentation at a PLUG meeting or in an advanced
topics meeting? I will probably be out of town for the July meeting, but
maybe August?

2 notes on this. Isn't RAID0 just striping? It provides no data
redundancy, just balances the data between the 2. If you are looking for
redundancy wouldn't RAID 1 be better? Point 2: RAID is not a replacement
for periodic backups. A corrupted database will replicate through all
the RAID drives and you will have no way to recover your data in this
event.

I think that as virus writers get more sophisticated and Linux becomes a
larger target, this will change. For example, suppose someone makes a
virus that contains a script that launches a buffer overflow, gets root,
then runs itself. I know from experience that many admins put off
applying patches for local exploits since "they need a local account to
run this anyway" Yes, it requires a non sophisticated user to run the
thing, but as more users migrate to Linux that aren't as technologically
savvy as we are, bad things could happen. Additionally, many viruses and
worms are polymorphic lately meaning that they cannot be detected by
virus scanners and network IDSs. Take the position that we are
inherently secure by using Linux at your folly. I'm of the opinion
lately that we are but one step ahead of the bad guys. They have way
more time, motivation, and coordination than we do and frankly, one
mistake and the balance of power can change rapidly.

I second that.  I took the SANS Institute class Perimeter Defense,
Firewalls and VPNs at the same confrence and it was excellent.  The
instructor was both knowledgable and experienced.  The course was full of
current, practical information and well worth the cost.  If you want vendor
neutral, timely security training with lots of Linux refrences, check out
www.sans.org.  This is for those who have money to spend.

The lowest cost Linux classes in Portland appear to be at www.freegeek.org
and at www.pcc.edu, Freegeek and Portland Community College.  Ed Sawicki
teaches Linux Installation and Configuration this Summer and in the Fall,
he is also teaching Linux Network Administration.  A class in Linux
Security is due Winter term, 2003.  Watch the PCC schedule for details.

Cheers,
Mike

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206090803290.28897-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Each Sunday, the cron daemon sends root a report with the results of
run-parts on cron.weekly. The only file in /etc/cron.weekly is
makewhatis.cron. There's nothing in that script that leads me to understand
the source of these error messages:

Read file error: ./cancel. No such file or directory
Read file error: ./slogin1.1 No such file or directory
Read file error: ./disable.8 No such file or directory
Read file error: ./reject.8 No such file or directory
Read file error: ./forms.5 No such file or directory

  Can someone please give me some insight into the source of these? Is
makewhatis trying to read non-existent files? These look almost like man
pages to me, but what's trying to read them?

  Time to tidy up all the little bugs that have hung around here far too
long.

Thanks,

Rich

I had a similar problem a few weeks ago.  However, I was only getting
the line about forms.5.  I reinstalled xforms from the rpm and haven't
had a compaint since.

My guess is that the others belong to other programs that need an
upgrade or reinstall.  Google is your friend :)

I agree. Wow. 

Like, we're not asking for a permanent change. Just a little tighter
security, until the proper measures can be put in place. 

Besides, I thought it *WAS* the sysadmins (or listadmins in this case)
job to ensure security where the list is concerned...

Sorry for the mess there, I was posting through the news gateway.  For
what it's worth, the headers in the spam (compared to mine) give the
appearance that the spam didn't even come through the gateway, making
its elimination or reconfiguration somewhat non-utilitarian.

How does one protect against buffer overflows, run Immunix? Or are there 
other ways? I mean unknown buffer overflows that might be exploited 
between the time that they are found and exploited and the time that they 
are fixed and a patch issued and given, as you mentioned, the fact that 
that not all system admins are good about keeping up with the patches.

I'm someone who likes to participate in the PLUG lists, but the volume is 
just getting to much hassle on my dial-up line.  Thus, I would like to 
start using the news server gateway, but I am also concerned about spam. 
 Personally, I think if there is some way to have the news gateway open and 
protected from spam, that would be a good thing.  Also, I hope the e-mail 
addresses are scrambled in some way so they can't be skimmed by spam-bots.

It seems to me that the news server. if it remains, should either be 
subscribers-only or should have e-mail addresses scrambled somehow.

I found at PC Heidens a D-Link firewall/switch.  I have been very happy with
it.  Works for my three computers and occasional Thinkpad.  It freed up my
Linux box so that it can be a workstation instead of a firewall.

http://www.dlink.com/products/broadband/di707/

I would not put any system on DSL/Internet without a firewall.  Especially
after all these security meetings lately.

The point is *not* the news gateway, the point is that the list admin 
opened the list to emails from non-subscribers to accomodate those who 
might want to use it. The spams are happening as a side-effect resulting 
from the fact that the list is now open to emails from non-subscribers.

All;

Please help me set my mind at ease on the Linux security thing. 

While it is true that Linux built with security in mind from the start
(file/group permissions, e.t.c.) an that (I believe) having the source
code open for peer review are good things, it is the human element of
the security picture that scares me the most:

    1) User receives an email from a cracker posing as a friend. The
sender instructs the user to save the attachment and run it... ``it's a
hoot, '' the cracker says in the message, ``you'll love it!''

    2) User saves attachment in his home directory and runs it.

    3) Script (or binary) performs the following:

       find / -name -exec rm -rf {} \; 2>/dev/null

    4) The script dutifully goes out and deletes every file that the
user has write privileges to including /tmp.

    5) The machine comes to a screeching halt (or at least it's
applications relying on /tmp do). The administrator is in a disarray of
what happened.

Let's suppose further that our hapless user is a member of group
``sales.'' Under this scenario, not only would the user's files be
deleted, but also the files and directories he has write permissions to
in the sales area, also.

``That can't happen,'' you might be saying, ``We will execute the
equivalent of the `file' command on each file as it passes through the
mail server.'' We will allow only documents through.

Okay, fine. The trouble is that email is not the only way to get a file
onto the system. Like so:

    1) The cracker social engineers the user name and password on the
system.

    2) The attacker launches a script that utilizes a known remote
exploit on the server.

    3) The script drops the executable in /tmp , su's to a known user
name (if it is not already working as that user), and runs the
equivalent to the `find' command above.

I've actually had a case like the one above. It exploited a hole in DNS.
It was incredible. It came in, dropped the source code in /tmp, and
compiled it's payload into a binary. The compiled code was designed to
go out to an irc channel and wait for it's author to type in a codeword.
Meanwhile, perhaps other thousands were listening there as well. 

The believe it was designed to destroy files.

It happened on my security officer's home machine. He sent it to me and
I analyzed it. It was written in C.

I'm worried.

RAID5 + Tape backup = good

Don't even think about IDE RAID because it is absolute crap :)

I think the point was that Karl broke the security for the regular lsit
so that people can post from the mail gateway. As it stands now the list
is wide open to everyone. In my opinion this is a dramatic change in
policy and it appears most of the list is for changing it back....or at
the very least those who want it as it is now aren't posting.

David announced at the beginning of the last meeting that the news gateway
would be closed . . . although he had not told Karl of this yet. (Karl
arrived at the meeting at some point after this.) To David's knowledge,
only Karl uses the news gateway.

Seeing how we still get a dribble of spam onto this list, either Dave has
not talked to Karl, or for one reason or another Karl hasn't gotten around
to acting on this.

Yes, you can apply kernel patches to prevent them in such a way as
Immunix does. Other prevention methods include keeping regular on your
patches and (my favorite) minimizing the use of all service that you
don't use.  For example, if you don't have the wu-ftp service running,
you can't exploit it. Also, don;t run services as root if you can help
it. To explain this one, an explanation of what a buffer overflow is
would be helpful. Basically, the developer does a poor job of checking
the size of a data field before he writes it to memory. This allows the
attacker to run a program that overwrites the return pointer in the
program to point to a line in memory that executes a command of the
attackers choice ( most often a shell). This gets run as the user that
started the program. So essentially if you start wu-ftp as root and
someone runs this program against it ...they have a root shell. From
there...you can guess what happens. The lesson here is to run things
with as little privilege as possible and then only when you need them.

I think this is related to man pages and the creation of a cache file 
for the "whatis" command. You might look at the makewhatis.cron file 
and see what command it is running.

These days IDE drives (7200rpm) are becoming seemingly as fast as SCSI 
drives, right?
It's all good until you want to start doing multiple reads and writes, 
this is where IDE's performance goes down.
SCSI supports multiple reads and writes (you can have 3 scsi drives on 
the same channel).
IDE isn't going to perform very well when the drives are sitting on the 
same channel...

In short, the more drives you add to an IDE RAID array, the worse it 
will perform when compared to scsi.

Correct me if i'm wrong anyone :)

Err...  any reasons for this belief?  I have a box with an Adaptec ATA

under $1000.

That's not what anybody's asking.

Neil was asking to have the list configured to provide no subscriber
lists, even to members because that's how he assumes a list operates.

This is a permanent change and nobody has suggested that it is a temporary
measure until something else is put in place.

It's the list admin's job to prevent spam from making it to the list.  On
that, we agree.  And the responsible thing to do here is to install
spamassassin and leave the news gateway in place.

As for the SECURITY issue (subscriber address availability), the list
already has a facility for those who choose to hide their address to do
so.  We don't need to make a global change to accomodate the few (even if
it's MOST, it's not all) who feel they need their address hidden.

Just to add to my comments some more, IDE drives "share" the channel 
they are on - SCSI drives do not need to do this.

I suspect the main reason you don't see linux viruses in the
wild is there aren't enough linux users, and Windows is too
easy a target in comparison.  If I were writing a
self-propagating linux virus, the hard part would be finding
other linux machines to infect.  It's easy to find another
Windows machine.  The Morris Worm spread quickly partly
because it targetted Suns and those were the most common
systems on the Internet at the time.

I've heard that DNS root exploits were the most common way
into linux/unix machines a year or so ago.  Dunno now.

I get the drift.

No.  Not at all.  The user loses his homedir and maybe some other stuff on
the system is lost, but I can't imagine a single service that would
screech to a halt due to this command.

Your example of /tmp is flawed because tmp has (or should have) the sticky
bit set so that only the user who created the file can mv or rm it,
regardless of other permissions.

Again, your friend the sticky bit could save you.

That's not why it can't happen.  And, of course, scripts can be
transmitted and executed all kinds of different ways.

Yeah, irc drones are pretty common.  You can bring your likelihood of
experiencing buffer overflow attacks and the like by running a non-x86
hardware architecture.  These kinds of attacks require the injection of
machine instructions into a process stack (usually through a public
network port).  If your machine doesn't run x86 instructions, the cracker
doesn't get his desired effect.  In some cases, the service will go down,
but no malicious code is run locally... and if you've got any kind of
service watchdog daemon, the blip might be no big deal.

I'm worried about two things:

Admins ignore user education (often they think of their users as "idiots"
or "lusers" and put poor effort into their training in order to maintain
their own feeling of superiority).  We know better than to do certain
things (like give our passwords to other people or run code we haven't
inspected or had inspected), there's no reason why your mom an dad and
brother can't learn the same simple precautions.

Diversity of architecture is poor (being divided mostly between Windows
and Linux on x86 with *BSD on x86 and Solaris on Ultrasparc coming up
behind in distant third and fourth).  A large computer network is a lot
like an ecosystem: destructive organisms have the most drastic effects
where diversity is low.

I hardly think that we can extrapolate a "most of the list is for" from a
sample that comes to something like a 4-3 split of seven subscribers on a
list with hundreds of members.

Okay, so what you mean is it's performance won't measure up to SCSI if you
use both channels of the controller(s) for your raid array -- there are
only two channels on an IDE controller.  So if you are looking for
redundancy rather than performance it should be fine, and if you want IDE
raid with high performance all you need to do is install more controllers
and only use the first channel of each controller, or alternatively buy
an IDE raid controller which implements it in hardware and will (most
likely - though it should be verified) use independent channels for each
drive.

Is this correct, or did I miss something?

Yes.

I still believe, backed by my personal experience, that IDE isn't very 
reliable.
IDE can, and will, break under heavy loads. RAID or no RAID.

IDE had its own place in the PC.
In this case, you do get what you pay for.

Here's a stupid question for you which I hope doesn't offend you...With 
some or all of the traffic not being broadcast to all ports are you 
sure that a hub was being used? The fundamental difference between a 
hub and switch is that a switch routes packets directly between systems 
and doesn't send packets to all ports unlike a hub. 

I'm not sure I've seen any of those little blue and black boxes from 
Linksys which weren't either a switch or a router. I've not used one of 
their DSL/Cable routers and so I don't know if they are a switch or a 
hub.

Re-read his second post on the subject. He specifically says that
getting a list of subscribers, when you are a subscriber, is ok.

Re-read the thread. Multiple people have made the suggestion that
TEMPORARILY this be changed, until such time as proper spam handling
capabilities are working. I've read it, obviously, you missed it.

And until that is done, denying posting unless you subscribe would be an
excellent alternative. It's an easy config change. If spamassassin can
be installed instead, and in a like timeframe, fine. No word one way or
another has been forthcoming from the list admin. It's the list admins
job to ensure the smooth operation of the list. The list being spammed
on a daily basis is not smooth operation. It's annoying behavior that is
easily remedied.

It should DEFAULT to the higher security. Sort of like your favorite
distribution should default to having services turned off. If folks want
their addresses out there, then they should opt-in to that option.

Ah, but this is not true. The archives of the list are a prime example
of what spammers crawl the web looking for. If you do a search for your
email address, the first hit is here:

http://plug.skylab.org/200104/msg00781.html

I realize that's the old archive and granted, the new archive shows
everyones address as the list address. This is probably why the list is
being spammed in the first place.

Really?  Because I keep reading posts that say "Close the news

Fine.  Then we agree, there.  The goal is simply to prevent spam, not to
make people feel like they're in some exclusive club.  So we can open the
list and leave the news gateway, so long as a reasonably successful spam
filter is in place.

Well, I would say that having a public list that rejects posts by
non-members is annoying behavior that is easily remedied.

Well, I don't personally believe that it's a security issue.  This is,
after all, a public and publicly archived list.  If it were not, we could
use the mailing list software's ability to turn off subscriber lists
entirely.

Making your own address unavailable is, in my opinion, a special need that
a person can and should meet for themselves (by configuring their personal
preferences).

A distribution (if you choose to let someone else package your software at
all) should default to having no services installed at all (except those
vital to the running of the system like kmod, of course... but would we
really call that a "service"?  I guess so, in a manner of speaking).

I don't see the difference in such a trivial matter.  The software isn't
built for an opt-in, so we use the only option-producing feature that IS
available within the software (the opt-out).

I dislike the current behaviour of munging the From: line in the
archive: 

  a) it is pointless unless you also munge each email going through
     the list because of private archives; and

  b) it interferes unacceptably with the ability to mail people

How about keeping the news server feed alive
for those who need it (such as our member who
has moved out of the area) and then restrict
access to the news feed for the group so that
only certain ip-addresses can access posting
usenet to the group. Assuming, of course, that
this type of access control is possible.

That's just it. If it's a "private" archive, how can it be different?
Each email going through the list IS munged. If I do a reply to all, it
still only comes up with one address to send to, the list.

>      privately.

I don't see how. The senders address IS in the mail that you receive
from the list. It's just not available from the web page, which I
personally consider to be a good thing.

OK, on ME re-reading his post, he does say that he doesn't want these
lists available at all. This I'm not inclined to agree with. 

I *DO* however, feel that names should NOT be included by default. Being
listed in the list of subscribers should be opt-in, not opt-out. 

> Really?  Because I keep reading posts that say "Close the news

Yes, and several that I've read have said it's a good thing, but only
subscribers should be able to post. They went on to say that it should
be temporarily shut down until spamassassin or some such is set up. 

However, I *DO* feel that you should subscribe to the list to be able to
post. This list should not accept posts from just anyone. That's asking
for spam, and even spamassassin isn't perfect. I get two or three per
week that don't trip spamassassins filtering. There's got to be a better
way than having the list be completely open.

Actually, I disagree with having a completely open list. There must be a
better alternative.

There are thousands (millions?) of mailing lists that require
subscribing to post. I find this to be highly effective when it comes to
making sure you keep an excellent signal to noise ratio. Of course, this
list has been deteriorating lately, but I digress.

That's MY information, and NO WHERE does it say that my information will
be available publicly. There should be a notice posted monthly, or it
should default to off. Other options are unacceptable.

That's like saying, "Bank of America will sell your information, unless
you send us a certified notice to have us remove you from our list." The
option should be with the user to choose to distribute, not to choose to
not distribute.

Exactly, and choosing to distribute someone elses information, without
their prior consent, is exactly the same thing, in my book anyway.
Subscribing to a mailing list is not the same as giving someone else
permission to distribute those email addresses. We're going so far
(address munging, etc.) to hide the addresses, then we distribute a
list? That's exactly the opposite direction. Why munge the posters
address in the list, if the list is available for download?

See my bank analogy above.

Is it even necessary to allow non-members to post to the mailing list
in order to enable subscribers to post through the newsgroup?

I happen to like the idea of making the list subscriber only (for a
number of reasons, the most important being spam, but the "please CC me
as I'm not subscribed" gets on my nerves occasionally as well).  But the
reason I actually wrote this email was to correct the above paragraph:
BofA (and in fact, any bank/financial institution) can (as of a short
while ago) and probably do, sell your information and you DO have to
send them written notice if you don't want them to be able to do so.

I don't see anything inherently wrong with the current Linux security
model.  How would you go about deciding when a user should and should not
be allowed to delete their own files?  It's been pointed out that we as
sysadmins need to educate users to not run email attachments.  I think
that's the best we can do.  If a user runs an email attachment that
deletes all their files, then hopefully they'll learn a good lesson.
Cooper's paranoia stemmed from the fact that he wasn't aware of the sticky
bit that is almost always set on the /tmp directory, which several others
have already corrected him on.

What's so stupid about reading root's email while logged in as root?

Tony,

  makewhatis -w

  It does look like man pages, but I'm not sure from where they are being
called.

root's email shouldn't go to a "root" mailbox. It should be redirected,
either to a special (unprivileged) account, or it should go to the
sysadmins regular email account.

Which is what I do.  All root messages are redirected to me.  This is
convenient since I don't have to login as root to get the messages (log
messages are sent to a remote logging server anyway, so there's not much
mail for root), but I still don't see what's so insecure about having a
root mailbox.  Maybe there's some glaringly obvious security hole I'm
overlooking right now...

Here's where our distros start to diverge. Under SuSE Linix there is not 
man page for "makewhatis" and in looking at my system "makewhatis" is a 
Bourne shell script that doesn't even support a "-w" argument. Perhaps 
some with a RedHat installation will be able to help you here.

As best as I can tell it looks like "makewhatis" goes through all of the 
man page files on a system and builds a cache file from those files. 
The usual format for a man page files is <command>.<section-number>. 
You might look at the appropriate man directory for the files that are 
causing the errors.

On my system the man pages reside in /usr/share/man/manX where X is the 
section number. At one time I thought that /usr/man/manX was the place 
where man files reside and I've seen this on non-Linux systems. On 
extra stuff that is installed locally into /usr/local the man pages 
reside in /usr/local/man.

HTH,

Tony

You don't even need a virus to get step 3 to occur. I'm man enough to 
admit to the fact that I accidently "rm -rf'ed" my home directory off 
of a system at work one time. Thankfully we had a great SA that had our 
server setup to take nightly backups of our home directories so I 
didn't lose anything. 

As a longtime user of Unix it took me 16 years before I ever made that 
sort of Unix mistake. I'm not sure I'll ever live that "uh oh" down. 
Our SA ribbed me about it for a while although he said it's not the 
first time he's seen someone do that.

Hanging my head in shame,

Tony

Hit 'v' while in less, and that will start vi, or whatever the
environment variable VISUAL or EDITOR is set to.  Just found this out
from the man page.  Cool!

I use both of these quite often, and am most curious about the answer. 
However, I am wondering why you want to do this.

Hi, 
Let me give you some numbers for Iwil Side Raid 100 
dual channel controller which I've got during system I/O scaling and testing.
Assume, that each HD is connected to its own channel on the raid controller.
Each hard drive is 40GB IBM 7.2K RPM with 2MB buffer.
Each HD's  own speed is 34.78 MB/sec
System bus I/O speed is 250.98 MB/sec

RAID0 implementation of two HD's gives in average 70.33 MB/sec data transfer 
rate at chunk size 4 kb and 68.82 MB/sec at chunk size 32 kb. Bus I/O 250.98 
MB/sec.

RAID0 of four HD's on two raid controllers gives 84.21 MB/sec at chunk size 4 
kb, 82.05 MB/sec at chunk size 8 kb, 81.01 MB/sec at chunk size 16 kb,
75.29 MB/sec at chunk size 32 kb and 70.33 MB/sec at chunk size 64 kb. Bus 
I/O 250.98 MB/sec.

RAID1 of two HD's gives just 8.65 MB/sec at chunk size 32 kb and 6.35 at 
chunk size 4 kb. Bus I/O 206.45 MB/sec.

RAID1 of four HD's on two raid controllers gives just 4.56 MB/sec at chunk 
size 32 kb and 3.91 MB/sec at chunk size 4 kb. Bus I/O 206.45 MB/sec.

RAID5 of four HDs on two raid controllers gives only 6.48 MB/sec at chunk 
size 128 kb. Bus I/O 134.74 MB/sec.

RAID0+1 gives 70.33 MB/sec at chunk size 4 kb and 69.57 MB/sec at chunk size 
32 kb on each independent RAID0. 
RAID1 of two RAID0's gives 36.57 MB/sec at chunk size 4 kb and 34.59 MB/sec 
at chunk size 32 kb. Bus I/O 250.98 MB/sec.

RAID1+0 gives 4.76 MB/sec at chunk size 32 kb on each independent RAID1.
RAID0 of two RAID1's gives 16.98 MB/sec at chunk size 4 kb. Bus I/O 193.94 
MB/sec.

You can conclude by yourself what solution is the best in here.
That is why I'm running simultaneously two MySQL DB's as master - slave 
replication schema. 
Each one of them is writing to its own data partition on independent RAID0.
If one RAID0 goes fishing the remaining DB becomes a master until failed 
RAID0 is back in business again.

I think that since less is a reader type utility someone might suddenly 
have the urge to edit and hence want VI.

I was cleaning up some subdirectories within my home directory. Somehow 
my fingers got crossed up and I pressed "." rather than entering the 
subdirectory name and then hit the <return> key. There was no going 
back from there.

I tend to alias "rm" to "rm -i" now so I can't make this mistake again. 
It's just one of those things that happens. I've certainly seen people 
nuke an entire subdirectory by accident over the years and nuking a 
home directory isn't much different. If you're cleaning up a directory 
within your home directory and if you're one level up boom! your home 
directory is gone instead of the subdirectory. 

I think the best way to avoid this is to always specify the directory by 
name that you want to remove. Don't use "*" or "." as that can nuke 
your current working directory which might be your home directory.

Since we're on the discussion of 'rm -rf'. I'll add my command that you don't

tar cf - / | (cd /disk2; tar xvpf - )

Anyone guess what this does incorrectly?

Opps I pressed "*" not "."...See I can't type sometimes...:) I took out 
all of the subdirectories within my home directory but left all of my 
.xxxx (dot) files intact so it didn't really remove my home directory 
per se. With all of my working directories gone it really just as bad a 
taking out the entire directory. Now it is possible to take out your 
home directory completely if you do an "rm -rf <user> from /home.

Sometimes these kinds of errors are due to dangling symlinks trying to be
indexed as files.  In other words, if you search your man paths for these
files are all of them symbolic links which point to nothing?

This is the wrong thing to do.  It trains you into thinking
that typing "rm" is safe, and if you go to some environment
other than your own, it's likely that there won't be that
alias, so you're more likely to get screwed.

A better thing to do is either get in the habit of typing
"rm -i" all the time, or make an alias that _isn't_ called
"rm" and use that instead of "rm".

A guy I knew in college did this as well;  He meant to type:

rm -rf *~

But by typing hastily, he accidentaly bounced on the space bar:

rm -rf * ~

And got:

rm: ~ not found.

He was reportedly confused for a few seconds, then nearly barfed.

A check of "alias rm" tells me if "rm" is aliased or not. All I can say 
is a mistake like this really sticks with me and I plan on never 
repeating it. I am not trained into thinking that "rm" is always 
aliased to "rm -i". Before doing any large directory cleanups I check 
what "rm" I am using and I make sure I specify the directory names and 
don't use any wildcard characters. 

That's what works for me but what I do may not work for anyone else.

If someone is using bash or tcsh with auto completions it gives a person 
a bigger gun to shoot their toes off with...I've seen people nuke 
directories because they were in a hurry and the auto completion wasn't 
what they were expecting but they had already pressed the <return> key 
before they realized it. :O

7200 is slow, scsi does 15,000 rpm. So it is twice as fast. 

Fujitsu's Silent Strike: The MAM3184MP With Ultra160 and 15,000 rpm 
http://www4.tomshardware.com/storage/02q2/020415/index.html

I believe that Seagate had 15,000 drive out 2 years ago, too. 

Old oracle dba I know love allot of small drives.

maybe, it is a function of the ide controller. 

the best performing ide raid card have one control per drive, the card
are FULL Length cards.  

here are a set of reviews, 2/2002 
 http://www.xbitlabs.com/storage/raid-roundup/

IDE raid does not scale well, in short it is a hack.
By scale I mean there are only so many drives before your case is a sea
of ide cables. IDE need a set length before it dies.

I have yet to see a 64 bit @ 66 Mhz controller for IDE raid. 

This is where the scsi cards are. 

How fast is Raid 5, is directly based on how fast the controller do the
raid checksum. 

While I worked for IBM doing Intel Xeon processors control flow dumps to
a 4~16 gig ram array. We made magic device that sat between the Intel
processor and the mother board. We did software raid 5. It was way
faster, then the slow little power pc based raid control that we bench
marked. Keep in mind that the box  for software Raid 5 were  2 way PIII,
4 way ppro and pIII xeons. Software Raid code uses the Katmi
instructions from MMx 2 I believe.   

If you look at the SCSI solution, is fading away at the high end as
people move to fiber channel. To increase the range of their cables,
then use scsi/160  at the drive.

Just saw in CompUSA's ad today that there is an SMC 8-port 10/100 
switch, and one more Gigabit Ethernet port for a total of 9 ports for 
$99 after rebates.  Plus they had an SMC 10/100/1000 NIC for $49 after 
rebates.

Off the topic, they had a 802.11b wireless router/AP for $99 and a 
PCMCIA 802.llb NIC for I think $79.  And the 802.11A AP was under $200!

Well, here's a little test to see if non-members can post to PLUG via email.

Subject: [PLUG] Thread Filtering, news gateway..
Message-ID: <1023684048.1528.3287.camel@obelisk.spek.org>

Hello,
  Does anybody know how to filter out a thread by mailbox in Evolution? 
Besides adding yet another filter to my already HUGE (and slow) filter
chain?  Or should I just start using my news reader to read the list?
(as it has this feature)  

  I ask because the email generated by people talking about spam far
exceeds the email that actually IS spam.

I know that I would try

tar cf - /| ( cd /disk2 && tar xvpf -)

Which should prevent you from trying to overwrite your files if you 
fat-finger the directory.  What else am I missing?

The _archive_ currently munges the From: address.  That is in addition
to the "Reply-To: munging (also harmful) that occurs for normal
message propagation.  For example, your message in the archive says
something like: "From: Russ Johnson <plug at lists.pdxlinux.org>", rather
than: "From: Russ Johnson <russj at dimstar.net>".  Anyone subscribed to
the list will get your "real" email address.  The only protection from
that is to not post to the list.

Also, private archives can become public.  If the current practice of
"From" munging persists, I'll consider publishing my own private
archive without the munging.

Munging introduces entropy into the data which makes future data
archeology (such as to create a future archive) more difficult.  As
someone who does data archeology for a living, it is something that I
find immensely annoying.

Suppose you are researching something posted a year ago.  If you want
to ask the person privately what they meant or how things turned out
or whatever, you can't, because you don't readily have a way to do
that.  You'd have to post to the mailing list (which they might not
still even be subscribed to) to try to reach them, which is wasteful.

Basically, it imposes an unnecessary cost of complexity and
obstruction for an illusory benefit.

That is a good idea: perhaps an alias something like rmi could be 'rm -i'.

I will accept the first statement but not the second. Work is the problem. Porn
at work is a serious issue. Its only serious because I can be fired, nothing
political, social, or religious implied.  Everything is logged on the network
and if we get something tagged, we have to notify IT, a pop up, a misspelt web
page request, a spam. It's not even worth the effort to use the Internet at
work. If you don't catch it and report it, then it is assumed you guilty of
attempting to view porn at work. I have the same issue with the colorful
language that is posted. No one was been terminated or reprimanded for colorful
language, but the accusation of viewing porn has ended a couple of employee's
jobs and been the topic of conservation at a few uncomfortable meetings between
employees and managers. The environment is down sizing. Trying to separate
employees from the herd is the normal managerial policy to accomplish this
goal. Why tolerate it? I need to leave on my terms not theirs. 

Why the list at work? We have a few Linux boxes and it is the one company perk
that makes day better.	

Thank you
Russell

Are you always that diligent with everything?  I know I'm
not.  Since you did slip up once before, it seems plausible
you may slip up again.  And it sounds to me like all the
steps you're going through is a lot more work than just
typing "rm -i" all the time.  I have periodic backups for
the big mistakes, and I type "rm -i" when I'm feeling unsure
of my competence.

Really, I'm arguing this because it annoys me to no end when
I sit down in front of someone else's shell and type "rm"
and get "rm -i" instead.  "unalias rm" is often the second
or third command I type.

And there's no rm option that will undo the -i option.
"rm -i -f" is not the same as just "rm".

OK - there should be a way to do this:

I have a bunch of files in directory 'A' and copies of MOST of these files in 
directory 'B.'

What is a command which would remove files in 'A' with the same names as the 
ones which appear in 'B' (so I am only deleting the extra copies?)

The files which are to remain in 'A' are all ones which do not appear in 'B.'

  I can recount how I *almost* did this last week. I'm a touch typist -- and
a fast one, too -- when I went to type 'rm *~' and my finger brushed the
[Enter] key on the way to the shift key (for ~). Fortunately, after
accidentally wiping out my dot files last year, I take the extra keystroke
of confirming all deletes before they happen.

Just for fun, the following also works:

  find /directory/you/wish/deleted -ok rm -rf {} \;

It will ask you before deleting each file and directory.

Correction:

It will ask you before deleting each file and directory.

I do.
Linux and Unix securities trust is based on what a user is allowed to
do.
Much of what is running on my machine I have no idea what it is doing or
supposed to do.  In the networked world we live in now we really need
privileges that can be set that limit what an executable is allowed to
do no matter who is running it. We could prohibit some executables from
doing anything but display to the screen and allow others to write and
read
from the disk but not modify any files it did not create. Trust needs to
be the intersection of what a user is allowed to do and what an
executable
is allowed to do.

Some mailers are capable of running an attached executable if you open
the
mail. It would run with root privileges.

This is a question for those of you with multiple linux machines on the 
same network.

What method do you use to keep users/groups/logins/passwords/everything 
else synchronized?  Or do you?

I'm trying to get yp working on my 2 (+2 soon) linux machines, but I'm 
not sure if it's the right solution.  I'll have a firewall, web/email 
server, and 2 additional machines for futzing around with soon, and I'd 
like to keep my environment relatively sane between them all.

Any ideas?

It also trains you to use 'rm -f' by force of habit, which effectively
negates the usefulness of the alias.

Another idea is to make use of a 'trash' directory in conjunction with
a simple shell script and a separate cron job. The following is crude,
but it works:

	#!/bin/bash
	# mv files specified to the designated "trashcan" directory.
	
	# location of the "trashcan"
	trash=~/trash
	
	if [ $1 = '-v' ]; then
	    errs=yes
	    shift
	fi
	
	for file in "$@" 
	do
	    if [ -d $file ]; then
		type=directory
	    elif [ -f $file ]; then
		type=file
	    else
		type=unknown
	    fi
	
	    if [ $errs ]; then
		mv $file $trash
	    else    
	        mv $file $trash 2> /dev/null
	    fi
	
	    if [ $? == 0 ]; then
		echo "$file : $type trashed"
	    else
	        echo "$file : $type could not be trashed"
	    fi
	done


Then have cron run 'tmpwatch' every day, and have it delete any files
unaccessed in more than N days.

So, do this:

Connect to your home machine via ssh, and view your email through the 
encrypted ssh pipe. Keeps the prying eyes out.

Use Opera with "Refuse pop-up windows". If you run a proxy at home, you can 
forward those requests through the ssh pipe too, but this would be slow.

Just a thought. I've never worked in an environment that was this (insert 
favorite word here) about network traffic.

Richard,

  On the three workstation, two portable network I have here, I use
/etc/hosts rather than anything more complicated. Machines don't change and
it's just easier to copy the same files to each box than try to install and
maintain another dynamic protocol for a static situation.

Trust me...if you blow away your home directory and potentially lose a

the schedule may slide a whole month makes you that diligent. Again the 
only thing that saved my butt was our excellent SA that setup our

Neil> What is data archeology? 

For me, it is about discovering (as in cases where the data are under
documented) and preserving semantics.  

When I began collecting old PLUG mailing list traffic, I discovered
that the skylab archive at the time only went back a few years.
Luckily, their archives were available in an unmunged form (i.e., an
mbox format with messages as they were received from the list).  I
have been able to collect contributions from other people in a similar
form (i.e., the full messages with all headers).  I can merge these
together and with some minimal munging (actually, just removing the
local delivery headers, the parts that were unique to delivery to a
particular subscriber) I can reproduce with good accuracy the common
parts of the message.  This approximates, close to perfection, the
messages as they passed through the mailing list host.  The result is
something that can be used for the next would-be archivist.

In (part of) my job, I am typically trying to preserve data sets from
scientific studies where data preservation wasn't their top priority.
Collecting and analyzing data, and then writing a report or paper was
their priority.  However, the funders usually have an interest in
maximizing the value available from the considerable investment they
dumped into the data collection and so for _them_ preservation _is_ a
priority.  As a result, I get a bunch of stuff in a box (disks and
reports, hopefully with a contact who still remembers what they did)
and I try to sort it out, describe and organize it coherently, and
preserve it such that it can be used again.

Neil> How is it diff from data mining?

I don't know, since I don't do "data mining".  My sense is that "data
mining" is more of a statistical inferential operation.  You are
trying to extract probabilistic meaning from a blob of data.

Agreed. But I'm not waiting for it. The next message out of my stack will 
be to unsubscribe from this list. There are others out there. When I hear 
that this mess has been cleaned up, I'll consider resubscribing. But for 
now, the noise ratio is just too high. [OT] discussions be damned -- it 
never bothered me to hit the "D" key on whatever I didn't want to read, 
but getting SPAM through the list is just too much.

  I know that I can replace file suffixes with a loop that renames files one
by one as the variable is incremented. If I want to change one character in
a series of file names, can I do this all in one fell swoop with a loop?

  Specifically, I have a bunch of digital images files named, for example,
0606_*.jpg, and I want to change them all to be 0605_*,jpg. Will it work to
run

for i in $i; exec 'mv 0606i 0605i'; done

?

  I don't want to blow away files or spend the rest of today working it all
out, so I'm asking.

Thanks,

Hello Linux folkz,

Could somebody please point me to the journaling FS on Linux which
could handle large file sizes without performance suffering.

Thank you.

I've heard SGI's XFS is well suited to dealing with very large files.

If you're using a recent distribution (or one with a util-linux version
of util-linux-2.11n-12 or higher -- that's from an RH7.3 box YMMV)
you can simply use the rename command.

rename 0606 0605 0606_*.jpg 

will do what you want.

Russell's approach is more elegant, and in the long run probably more
useful. When I am faced with doing something hazardous, I usually create
a copy in a separate directory somewhere and test the action on the
copy.

And if you grok perl regexp's and want to take it a step beyond, check out
rename.pl:

http://www.sial.org/code/perl/scripts/rename.pl.html

That's what I use to rename the .jpg's from my Olympus D490Z to yyyymmddnnn
format from it's crufty kluge...

    Pmddnnnn.jpg

...where "P" is a literal, and the single digit month uses "a" for October,
"b" for November and "c" for December - and the year is not noted.

The rename.pl script I referenced has a `-p' switch for that purpose.

I have done this, for a similar exercise
(saving this as a file, and chmod +x'ing it
-----------
#!/bin/bash
  FILES="`ls *.jpg.jpg`"
  for i in $FILES
   do
      x=`echo "$i" | sed 's/\.jpg\.jpg$/\.jpg/g;'`
      mv "$i" "$x"
   done
echo "process complete"

You can probably see how to alter it to make your stuff
happy.  But Jeme and Paul's solution are probably better.

As the title says... How does 'ls' determine file type for purposes of
color-coding it's listings? The man and info pages don't seem to give
any clue.

My question stems from my desire to have files of, say, *.tiff displayed
the same as those of *.tif (truncated file-type extensions are one of
my pet peeves). Currently, the image files with short extensions are
colored some garish pink, while the "proper" extensions are not colored
at all. Argh.

Seriously broken for whitespace-containing filenames.  Bah!

Here's a safe version of that:

perl -e 'chdir "/directoryb" or die; unlink map "/directorya/$_", <*>'

No problem with whitespace now.

There is a utility called dircolors.  This associates extensions and
permissions with various colors.  The output on my system is:

WAY2FONKY$ dircolors 
LS_COLORS='no=00:fi=00:di=01;34:ln=01;36:pi=40;33:so=01;35:do=01;35:bd=40;33;01:cd=40;33;01:or=40;31;01:ex=01;32:*.tar=01;31:*.tgz=01;31:*.arj=01;31:*.taz=01;31:*.lzh=01;31:*.zip=01;31:*.z=01;31:*.Z=01;31:*.gz=01;31:*.bz2=01;31:*.deb=01;31:*.rpm=01;31:*.jar=01;31:*.jpg=01;35:*.jpeg=01;35:*.png=01;35:*.gif=01;35:*.bmp=01;35:*.pbm=01;35:*.pgm=01;35:*.ppm=01;35:*.tga=01;35:*.xbm=01;35:*.xpm=01;35:*.tif=01;35:*.tiff=01;35:*.mpg=01;35:*.mpeg=01;35:*.avi=01;35:*.fli=01;35:*.gl=01;35:*.dl=01;35:*.xcf=01;35:*.xwd=01;35:*.ogg=01;35:*.mp3=01;35:';
export LS_COLORS

According to the man page, you can specify a file that contains this
information, and it will use that instead of its own database.

Do an `echo $LS_COLORS' and you'll see what its default settings are.
Capture that and you can twiddle it to your heart's desire.

Two guesses? They're both good but not the right answer. Here it is:

The original was:

tar cf - / | (cd /disk2; tar xvpf - )

What would happen here is that tar is extracting absolute pathnames,
in effect overwriting every file on the system. When it gets to the 
system files, ones that you need while the system is running, 
it overwrites them. A crash in the making.

The correct command would be:

cd /
tar cf - . | (cd /disk2; tar xvpf -)

But even that may put you in a circular loop because disk2 is mounted.
It'd probably be best to specify the files specifically instead of everything.
Something like:

cd /
tar cf - var etc home | (cd /disk2; tar xvpf -)

would be better.

I need to create some PDFs of 11x17 pages, but my initial attempts to
make the PDFs show that all of them are cropped at 8x11.  I've looked
at the docs, and they don't mention anything about size limitations or

I do not believe that it is even necessary to open up the mailing list
to non-member posts in order to enable members to post through the
newsgroup. The current Mailman setting is basically a mis-
configuration, AFAICT.

A Mailman list can be configured to receive posts from members only
and to verify members by checking the From: header. Both SMTP and NNTP
have a From: header, so using this policy, Mailman should use the NNTP
From: header to verify members who post through the news group. So if
you post to the newsgroup using a From: field that is a member's email
address, then the post will be sent to the mailing list as well.

This policy would have prevented the recent SPAM while allowing list
members to post through the news gateway.

A tighter policy would use the unixfrom envelope instead of the From
header for authorization. It looks like for Usenet posts, the Mailman
gate_news script sets the unixfrom header to the list administrator's
email address. As long as the list administrator can post to the list,
then all Usenet posts would be sent to the mailing list using this
policy. However, this policy might cause grief for people who
regularly post from different computers.

Would you communicate this to karl at microsharp.com and
david at microsharp.com?

They need to be told of this mis-configuration because proper
configuration solves one of the list problem we have been going back and
forth about! Ug.

I've created PDFs of up to 36x36 inches.

It would help if you explained your process for creating PDFs.

However, I believe the intent of the list operator was to enable people to 
read and post to the list, through the news server, without receiving the 
messages via email at all.

I would think there would be software out there that would gate messages in 
this manner, without the need to open the list to abuse. i.e., all messages 
in a newsgroup are gated to a mailing list, and vice versa. Unfortunately, 
spam gets injected into news servers as well, so then you can't let the 
newsgroup be propagated through the news servers of the world. And you have 
to require people to log into the news server to post and/or receive.

I think you're right in the sense that messages coming through the news
gateway should very well carry the original From: header and if that's a
list member, it should accept the post.

This is easily tested.

And if a person wanted to use the news gateway, they could simply
subscribe and select the "no mail" option.

However, I still think that a spam filter is the best solution.

> The current Mailman setting is basically a mis- configuration, AFAICT.

That's a judgment call I'm not prepared to make.

Mailman allows subscribers to set a "no mail" flag.  See my immediately

[snip]

If you are creating the postscript files from Latex and ave the `dvi'
file then might I suggest dvipdf or dvipdfm. 

I have used neither of them with 11x17 but the man page for dvipdfm (I
have found dvipdfm to produce higher-quality output and supports more
PDF features) indicate that you can use it with the -p switch to specify
paper size. It is available at CTAN's sight, www.ctan.org.

Hopefully someone will be able to answer the root of your question. If
you are creating PDF's from Latex files, though, this may be the answer.

Well since ps2pdf* all use ghostscript, you can check out that man page,
and from a cursory glance it looks like you should be able to pass
-sPAPERSIZE=11x17 to ps2pdf and have it work.

Ah, I am beginning to see the light. 

I believe you are both right, post-only membership is the crux of the
problem and the 'no mail' option is the correct solution.

You can select 'no mail' by accessing the "Edit Options" feature at
https://lists.pdxlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/plug.

Subject: [PLUG] What PLUG needs
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0206101606050.1837-100000@localhost.localdomain>

Okay, I am going to go out on a limb here and suggest that PLUG needs to 
re-organized a bit in order to be more effective. I think that this 
discussion is on-topic but I ask that if this discussion ranges beyond the 
very focused discussion on PLUG then please let's move it to plug-talk.

1. Officer elections.

I believe that PLUG needs officer elections for a number of different 
posts. One of the monthly meetings should be completely devoted to this 
election. We should probably determine the posts ahead of time.


2. Better list admin.

The list needs a small cadre of list admins who spend some time thinking 
about list config *and* some sort of moderation is needed. Not moderation 
before a post makes it to the list but I would say more along the lines of 
a polite reminder and then actually moving threads to plug-talk if they 
range too far off topic.

I like an active list but even I think the list noise is a bit too much 
now. Of course, I have contributed to this noise -- as have many others -- 
but I think it is important for us to get this under control if we are 
going to retain members. We don't want people unsubscribing because of 
list noise. That is stupid.

I am sure we could easily get together a half-dozen informal moderators 
who would be willing to help nudge the list back on topic.

3. A better Web site.

Unfortunately, there is not much of a Web site to speak of right now. 
There were plans for build a custom back-end, etc., but those 
plans seem to be going nowhere right now. What we need is a core of 
practical developers/designers/content people/admin people to put something 
together. To get something good up there relatively efficiently.

I am willing to do my part and write content but that is all I am 
interested in doing (actually, that will take quite a bit of time). I have 
written some already but we need a better site.

Do we have a designer or two out there willing to put together a nice 
site? Someone to setup Zope or something like that? We need to just move 
forward on something in this area. Please join plug-web and state your 
interest in making something happen.

4. More speakers and substantive meetings.

We have had some good speakers no question about it but I think a lot more 
could be done in this area. My feeling is that this is related to 1 above. 
If we can get a core of officers then I think more can happen in these 
areas.

I disagree that PLUG needs "official" officers.  David does a fine job
of coordinating things.  The danger of the kind of bureaucracy you are
suggesting is that someone gets into a position of "authority" and
then for whatever reason (e.g. "burnout", "distractions", "malice",
etc.)  becomes an "obstruction".  No authority, no obstruction, people
with the energy just "do".

What do you mean by "more could be done"?  Are you referring to your
"big-name" speakers idea?  You need to do a better job of motivating
this idea.  _Why_ is it a good idea?  _How_ will it advance _which_
goals?

We've had a series of outstanding speakers and presentations recently.
It is hard to see how we could be "doing better".  Maybe you didn't
see them.

At the risk of sending a simple "me too" post, I have to say that I agree
wholeheartedly with Russell on this one.

We don't need some hierarchical power structure to tell us how to share
our thoughts and experiences in the GNU/Linux/Unix community and
workplace.

The speakers in the past six months have been EXCELLENT (Ward's talk was
probably one of the high points of my year) and people organize events
when they are passionate and can make it happen.  I can't imagine how the
consolidation of power into the hands of the few would improve things.

And really, as long as the list isn't discussing the list, the volume and
signal/noise ratio stays totally reasonable.

That is not up to me to decide. That would be for the officers and the 
members of PLUG.

Yes, and David could stand for election and be elected. He could then ask 
what the group wants to see happen and coordinate making it happen. This 
is *not* in any way denigrating his leadership.

I think we need leadership that is directly accountable to the members. 
One year terms to reduce the possibility of burnout. And, if someone is 
getting tired, they simply say so and call early elections. No shame in 
saying look I am tired of this. If an officer still wants to continue in 
one year then he or she says so and stands for election again.

Again, the goals are not up to me. I am merely suggesting that there is no 
process in place for any sort of goals.

As for my big speakers idea, yes, that could possibly be one of the goals. 
If we had officers then yes we could recruit more officers.

And I said yes we have had good speakers. I was not in any way denigrating 
the speakers.

Well, there have recently been discussions of politics and even a thread 
on swearing and whether or not swearing is good or not. Some people even 
posted one sentence top posts about this.

This is the last I am going to say about this in defense of the idea 
(unless anyone wants clarification of the idea or if we want to move 
forward mainly because I don't want to argue and take up a lot of list 
space. If people like the idea let's do it; if not then forget it.

But clearly you think that PLUG is not effective ENOUGH.  You want it to
be MORE effective.  Is it not possible that we are optimally effective at
meeting our shared mandate?

> Yes, and David could stand for election and be elected. He could then
> ask what the group wants to see happen and coordinate making it

You misunderstand.  David just organizes things because he has the time
and wants to do it.  If I called Dave and said, "Dave, I'd really like to
make particular arrangements for such and such meeting."  I think Dave
would say "Go for it."

Dave is de facto organizer, but I don't think anyone thinks he has some
power derived from the membership.  Such power simply does not exist in
this organization.

> I think we need leadership that is directly accountable to the
> members.

Accountability is only an issue if there is an abuse of power.  Without
power, there is no abuse.

And how do you propose a group such as ours carry out this
"accountability"?  Do we start banning people from meetings or
posting?  Do we take away their beer privileges?

While there is no power to abuse or corrupt, there is also no power to
punish or intimidate.  Accountability is a meaningless term in a
non-hierarchical organization of people.

Nobody's giving paychecks.  Nobody pulls the strings.

> Again, the goals are not up to me. I am merely suggesting that there
> is no process in place for any sort of goals.

Yes, there is.  If I have a goal, I say, "Hey, who wants to meet this
goal?" and folks join or not.

Look at the resume database project for a recent example.

> If we had officers then yes we could recruit more officers.

Isn't that like raising funds to fund fundraising?

> And I said yes we have had good speakers. I was not in any way
> denigrating the speakers.

You're implying that, as an organization, we're not effective.  You want
to increase this ephemeral "effectiveness" but are also trying to say that
everyone's doing a good job.  So what's the deal?  Why impose power where
none is needed?

I agree with Russell's disagreement. (Is "disagreement" a word? :-)

I don't see much benefit. It's one thing to reach consensus on
appointing people to take care of some tasks. If we've been lax in
that regard, then we all need to step up more -- but I seriously doubt 
that electing officers is going to help us function better.

Better, perhaps, would be an agreed-upon list of who's doing what so 
we know who, if anyone, has responsibilities in a given area. The 
current list as I know it is

* Meetings: Dave
* Clinics: Paul, Dan, Eric
* Mailing list: the fine folks at Micro Sharp
* Advanced topics: Zot

The only standing responsibility to which I can't attach a name is

* Web site

To my way of thinking, this arrangement is fine. The official-task 
folks have two responsibilities as far as I'm concerned:

1. Take care of the duties for which they volunteered.
2. Let us know when they can no longer do #1.

I guess you weren't at the last PLUG meeting, where I set out the future
plans for the Web Site, Neil. What will be done is as follows:

As Interim Web Page Development Leader, I will be updating parts of what's
currently there to fix state links & so forth. I will also be adding a
page to help announce the topic of every meeting, & will be building an
archive of links to prior meeting topics. My principal stumbling block at
this point (& why all of this happen for the last meeting) is that I'm
having some issues with ssh.

Dave Mandel has a brief history of PLUG that we need to add to the
Web page.

Currently, Wil Cooley has rebuilt the web site in PHP format. Writing
static PHP content is quite simple: I learned how to do it in less than
half an hour.

What we have is not the wonderful site people talked about creating six
months ago, but it exists & gets the job done.

NOW, if you don't like what's there, or you want to help in creating
content, my advice is very simple: Do it. Write the content, create a
new page template, rewrite the web site in Zope, roll-your-own Perl
scripts, or VisualBasic. But do the work & offer the content.

I can add the content if you send it to me. If you need an account, contact
either Karl Hegbloom or Wil Cooley. (Karl has told me that if a person
proves him or her a trustworthy & capable person, he has no qualms about
giving the root password to drizzle.)

What sunk the web page earlier this year, I believe, was the fact people
got into a cycle of talking about what to do, & never got around to
creating anything concrete. This is not unique to PLUG: Alan Cox noted
that this has happened in the past, & how he feels it should be fought --
see his article ``Cathedrals, Bazaars and the Town Council" on Slashdot,
http://slashdot.org/features/98/10/13/1423253.shtml

As Interim Web Page Development Leader, I give everyone permission to
contribute what they feel the web page needs. PLUG has a lot of capable
folks in the group, some of whom don't believe they are capable of
contributing. Let's get some new stuff up on the web site, & start asking
the PLUG membership for their feedback. Should the unimaginable happen,
& we have too much activity & people are getting in each others' way,
then we'll have a meeting & sort things out.

But let's stop saying we should do something, & simply DO IT. As my
high school wrestling coach used to say, even doing the wrong thing
is better than sitting around doing nothing.

(If you agree with this, don't send a follow-up to the list saying
something like ``M3 T00". Write content. And if you can't think of what
to do, I have some ideas. Ideas that a few folks threw out after last
Thursday's meeting included a wikiwiki page & a database for trading
computer books. If you think these are good ideas, get an account on
drizzle & start setting them up.)

But what would you _like_ them to be more effective at?  You must have

change for the sake of change.  Show us why officers are necessary

Neil, maybe David doesn't _want_ to become the servant of the group.
Maybe he likes doing what he is doing, sees that it is effective and
contributes towards his goals and is satisfied with that.

We _have_ leadership (or not) that is accountable.  Someone has an
idea and either people agree and help or they don't and don't.  I
think it works pretty well and pretty organically, with not a lot of
overhead.  Unless you can come up with some desireable goal that can't
be accomplished with the organic leadership we have now, then I don't
see why we should change.

Did you mean to say "speakers" there?  Do you have any evidence that

speakers?

That's fine as that plan was pie-in-the-sky anyway.

Look, it was an idea. Forget about it, okay? If people don't like my idea 
fine but I am already tired of talking about it. I apologize for bringing 
it up.

And my idea obviously is not flying so I am now dropping it. :-)

If people were now somewhat enthusiastic about my idea then I would want 
to talk about it more. It is not happening.

I'm willing to take a crack at setting up a WikiWiki using MoinMoin,
unless someone has good reasons to select another WikiClone. I'm assuming
drizzle has mod_python. I've thought a Wiki would be a great way to make a
"living" FAQ to which people could cross-post as another way to archive
the really good nuggets that are sent to the list.
Eric H. can vouch for my lack of malice. Eric? Eric? (The silence is
deafening...) :-) Don't have Karl's address, though. Can someone forward
this to him or send me his address off-list? Thanks,

Anthony:

I'm never one to get offended by "stupid" questions meant to clarify
things.  Your question was completely legitimate.

Yes, the linksys hubs in question were marketted as hubs, but behaved
strangely.  The uplink port echoed to every other port, but the non-uplink
ports only echoed unicast traffic to the uplink port.  Multicasts and
broadcasts went to all ports.  Strange, eh?

I wish I could remember the model of these.  They didn't all do it
either-- I suspect that they might have used some strange internal chipset
for one production run that was flawed.

This was pre-blue and black when they were white.  ;-)

I've found the NetGear equipment to be far more consistent.  (Consistency
is worth the extra 15% to me...)

Maybe that behavior is a "feature" intended to discourage peer to peer
networking at the access layer.  ;)

There is one good point to adopting a more formal structure: Dave Mandel
has mentioned that there are several benefits if PLUG incorporated as
a non-profit organization. We could collect dues, donations, & grants to
bring in speakers from outside the Portland area, buy needed equipment
(e.g., it would be nice to know we had a projector for each meeting),
be able to rent space for functions (PSU may not always want grant space
to our unofficial organization), sponsor conferences or attendence at
conferences, & perhaps pass on grants or scholarships to further interest
in Linux & UNIX. Another benefit is that as a formal organization we could
negotiate group discounts or benefits for all members (e.g. some of us
are self-employed & may benefit from a group medical plan). A third
benefit would allow PLUG to affiliate or enter into mutually beneficial
agreements with other professional organizations like the IEEE, the ACM,
or even the Software Association of Oregon.

None of these, admittedly, are sufficient reasons to incorporate tomorrow
or even this year, but I suspect there are some benefits here that all
of us could appreciate on one level or another, & thus are worth talking
about -- or at least thinking about. I invite everyone to at least think
about this.

Some ideas:

1. Augment the content that is already there --
   * Add to the FAQ
   * Add to the collection of Linux resources
   * Add to the collection of Open Source in the NW links

2. New content --
   * Periodically people ask questions about the best computer stores
     in town, specialty electronics stores, used computer stores, &
     computer repair shops. We could use a list of these that is kept
     up to date.
   * An idea I had -- but have not been able to develop -- is a list of
     resources for the Linux enthusiast who has installed Linux
     successfully on her/his system, has some skill with the command
     line & a text editor, but now wonders ``What's next?" This
     could be a collection of URLs, books or periodicals that help plumb
     the mysteries of X, printing under Linux, databases, & so on.
     Or it could be a Howto.

3. Magazine-like content --
   * Howtos, descriptions of how you started as an innocent with a given
     computer application & learned how to master it.
   * Articles on Linux in the NW. One fact about Linux, *BSD & the other
     Unices is that we have an underappreciated concentration of talent
     here in Portland: we need to publicize this talent, & record its
     history here. Otherwise, people will mistakenly believe that all
     important computer developments take place in Silicon Valley, the
     North Carolina research triangle, the Boston/New York/Washington DC
     sprawl -- & nowhere else.

I know this last catagory sounds an awful like what Computer Bits,
Linux Gazette, & the other publications might publish to a larger audience.
My point for suggesting these topics is to encourage everyone to cast our
nets wide & see what we catch, & learn which items we have caught are
worth keeping. And if a disappointed author leaves our humble website to
contribute for one of these other venues, I feel we have still done our job
by creating one more Linux-savvy journalist. And we all know we can never
have too many of these.

Lastly, look over the last 6 to 12 months of the PLUG mailing list.
I feel that there are many ideas there. If nothing else, a weekly digest
or review like the ones done for the Linux Kernel mailing list would be
quite useful -- & allow people to enjoy the wheat without dealing with
either the chaff or the flamewars of the PLUG list.

Well, since one person has expressed a bit of interest in this idea, I am
going to jump back in. Part of the process of having formal officers and
so on would be to incorporate as a non-profit. I know from a few private
conversations that there are others who are very interested in this as
well.

We would have a budget so we can pay the cost of a big name speaker or
two. When I researched speakers, I found that many of them do cost some
money if they are from out of town. Again, this is in *not* suggesting
that we don't have good speakers now because clearly we do get
outstanding speakers now, I am just suggesting it might be interesting to
broaden the pool a bit.

With a budget we could do other things as well, though we would of course
be very conservative in how we spent the money. My first instinct is to
suggest that the yearly dues would be low: something like $15 per year.
And I am guessing that we would get some grants from companies and
organizations for special purposes -- companies and foundations might
contribute to a speaker's fund or a K-12 project fund (very important) or
possibly a technology budget to buy things like a projector.

A partial officer list might look something like this:

President - run meetings, arrange speakers, coordinate PLUG
Vice-president - assist President and stand-in in President's absense.
Secretary - meeting minutes, etc
PLUG for Education Coordinator - Coordinate the various K-12 projects.
Fundraiser and Grant Coordinator - Solicit donations and write and submit
grant proposals to companies and foundations.
Webmaster - Web site coordinator.
Events Coordinator - Organizes clinics, etc.
Outreach Coordinator - Public relations about PLUG to the press.

These people would largely have coordination roles and several of these
roles, as has been pointed out, have de facto occupants. For example,
David Mandel now de facto holds the President's position; Eric Harrison
I believe is now de facto PLUG for Education Coordinator position.

In some cases it may be obvious who should hold a given position but we
should still hold elections and validate these assumptions through a
reasonable electoral process.

Just to  be clear, this is not about power trips for the officers. They
would be coordinators. This would in no way hinder other's freedom.

So, we would have officers, a budget, and a more activist stance in the
community and play a stronger role in education, private industry, and
government in Oregon.

We can continue as we are and have the status quo, which is pretty
good, or we can incorporate, have officers, and really make some progress.
Maybe PLUG could even become the model of what a LUG can achieve in a city
and state. Maybe we could be the catalyst that is needed to really move
Linux forward the various sectors.

I have heard that we are a remarkably large and active group -- much
larger, for example, than the Seattle LUG. Portland has a strong and
committed LUG community. Let's do something exciting with it.

To which I'd add...

4. Bring the current and future content into compliance with w3c standards.

I know the content is paramount, but I think it's also important to show
that PLUG values web standards and sets a good example. The more
non-compliant content we put up, the harder it will be to regroup.

Paraphrasing a few posts here to cut down on the bandwidth. 

New design suggestions have been done.....

Why not put them up on the server in a test directory, not connected to 
the main site, send the URLs to the list so the members can take a 
look to see whats been proposed.

Content like howto's etc.

There is a great site called Linux Step-by Step, that is just that how 
to's written by list members. It started as just on the Caldera Distros 
but has expanded to include all distros. They welcome additions by 
pretty much anyone. So why not augment that site and link to it or 
mirror it? Its done by a really great group of folks from all over the world.

http://linux-sxs.org/stepbystep.html

I would be glad to work on page layout and design but can't until after 
July as I am kinda busy on another project that is consuming all my 
time.

Speaking as the president of a non-profit trying to re-establish 501c3
status, there are certain aspects of non-profits you should be aware of.
(see more details at http://www.filinginoregon.com/bic/nonprofit.htm)

There are two types of non-profits that apply here:

1. Mutual benefit.
2. Public benefit. (IRS code 501c3)

If you want donors to give tax deductible grants to the organization , you
need 501c3 status.
In order to get 501c3 status, you have to have very explicit by-laws that
include:
You can't force people to join, in order to benefit from the organization,
which means collecting dues is a voluntary thing.

What I'm getting at, is unless you anticipate significant grants, the
overhead isn't worth all the effort.

I'm only at work one or two days a week now, and am very busy.  I do not
have very much time to spend on the PLUG mailing lists.

Is anyone using the news gateway?  Will anyone mind much if it goes
offline, at least until someday when a subscribers only posting can be
configured for it?

If that is not really in use, I can close the list so you don't have to
delete the small amount of "SPAM" that finds its way to the list.

Another option (perhaps more interesting) is to install spamassasin and
test that.  That's a project worth trying, but it will take several
hours or perhaps several days to get working.  I'm not going to spend
free time on it, since I don't have any.  Would someone like to research
that option please?  The list is managed with GNU Mailman, and the mail
is run by "exim".

Gotcha.

Print Postscript file from multi-million dollar CAD software.

Examine postscript with ghostview and confirm that it's 11x17

Read ps2pdf manpage, ps2pdf13 manpage, ps2pdfwr manpage, none of
which have any really useful information about options to those
programs.

Look at ghostscript.com, ditto about the information.

ps2pdf file.{ps,pdf}

acroread file.pdf

PDF file is cropped to 8.5x11.

It does.  Although I have to admit that I'm confused why the switch
is needed.  The page size is in the postscript file.  Maybe I should
submit a bug/feature report.

Colin,

  What size print do you get from the pdf file? I wonder if acroread crops
it for viewing, but would print it at the original size.

You know, I never tried that (and can't easily, since I overwrote the
file once I learned about the -sPAPERSIZE switch).  When I opened the
file, at the bottom of the viewer it says 8.5x11, so I assumed that
there wasn't any more information.  Maybe I'm a victim of WYSIWIG?

This is because of your floppy entry in /etc/fstab. Check out the line
in /etc/fstab that talks about /dev/fd0. Pay special attention to the
options in the last column (users, noauto, e.t.c). You will likely be
able to simply copy the floppy line and modify it to your needs for the
Samba share. Change /dev/f0, for example to
/dev/your_drive_partition_to_mount and the mount destination directory,
for example.

Further information, from the `mount' man page...


       ``Only  the  user that mounted a filesystem can unmount it
again....If  any  user should  be able to unmount, then use users
instead of user in the fstab line.  The owner option  is  similar  to 
the user  option,  with  the restriction that the user must be the owner
of the special file. This may be useful e.g. for /dev/fd  if a login
script makes the console user owner of this device.''

Yes, people are using the news gateway to post to the PLUG list.

Are you sure that closing the list will block list members from
posting through the news gateway? From my reading of the Mailman
gate_news and Message.py source, it looks like it should just work.

Maybe you could try closing the 'mmlist' test list and I will see
whether I can still post to it through the news gateway.

Ugg, I really don't want a separate mount point for every samba share I
mount.  Most of the time, I mount for one or two files to be copied,
then umount, and mount another share on the same mount point,I usually
only mount one or two regularly, but those aren't the ones I need to
umount regularly.  I don't see a way to pass the user option through the
mount command, but it seems like that is what needs to happen.  How do
the GUI tools do it, some trick with suid?

Derek;

I'm working on a project right now, but here's a few thoughts that come
to mind:

1) You can pass options to the mount command, like so:

   mount -o users -o noauto /dev/device_mounting_from
/destination_directory

2) You can put this is a script and run it from the command line.

3) Red Hat used to have a graphical mount tool. I assume other
distributions do, too. Red Hat aficionados can help you here if you have
Red Hat. Some restrictions may apply, see your dealer for details.

You may want to search for ``mount'' or ``mount tool'' on
www.freshmeat.net.

4) We're modest, too.

I will follow up with this if you don't get satisfactory results.

You don't need to have a separate mount point for each samba share, unless 
you want to mount them all at once.

if you use the mount command like this:

mount -t smbfs -o username=user,password=pass /machine/share /dir/to/mount/on

I tried the command:

smbmount //winbox/"My Documents" /home/derek/mnt -o username=derek -o
user

which mounted, but won't umount unless I'm root.  If I swap the order of
the options, the mount will fail.  If I place the -o user right after
the smbmount, I get an incorrect usage error; which does not list "user"
as a valid option.

If I issue the command:

mount -t smbfs -o user //winbox/"My Documents" /home/derek/mnt

I get the "you must be root" error.

I use debian unstable, and can't get any of the GUI tools to work, my
thinking is that if I can get it to work from command line, I have a
much better shot at getting the GUI to work (not that I need to, once
the command line is working).

That turned out to be a great idea!  I didn't find a program, but I did
find a link to a How-To that I hadn't seen before, and it mentioned the
command smbumount (now that I see it, duh).  So:

smbumount /home/derek/mnt 

did the trick!!

Life with SMB is looking much less complicated now.

Thanks

Derek

I couldn't get this command to run as a user.  The machine name also
needs // in front if it to be recognized as a remote machine.

I'm with you until right here.  He's probably right and that's very cool.

> Whoever invents that will make a lot of money."

Now, if he thinks that a well-paid programmer makes "a lot of money", then
I'd say he's right.  But if by "a lot of money" he means "more than is
usually commensurate for his profession", I'd say he's dead wrong.

I see one of two likely scenarios at this critical stage in human
social development:

1.  The "industry" that privatizes thoughts and ideas will be crippled or
disabled by the time such a thing is created.  The person who initially
creates this software (assuming it can be implemented wholly in software)
will have no more ability to use this success to create personal wealth
than dozens of other highly skilled programmers.  The software will be
(rightly) unredeemable in trade, but his originality and skill (assuming
the creation wasn't an admitted fluke) will still be tradeable and,
therefore, economically valuable.

2.  The existing trend of great economic power translating to great
political and legal power will continue and very little information will
be considered "public".  The person who initially creates said software
(again with the assumption that it's just software) will be a student
working under a corporate grant or a contractually-bound employee of a
private corporation and the fruits of his labor will belong to the
corporate entity and not to himself.  The corporate owners will take this
"property" and use it to accrue heaping piles of cash... but the person
who created it will be no more rewarded than any other skilled programmer.

Anyway, those are the two most likely scenarios in my book.

Cassandra speaks.

Now come to think of it, your DNS server may not have updated with the
IP address for that domain.

This one points to the same page:

Or this one...

This might also be helpful:

It's free (odd license, tho) and links in with a number of UNIX/linux
scanners (like F-Prot, which I've previously plugged here...)

I haven't used it, but it looked promising for your purpose.  I generally
prefer draconian enforcement of resident scanner installation rather than
relying on E-mail filters which are slow and do little but alert you to an

I can only imagine how horribly things like my sneakemail address mess up
data archeology.  Unfortunately, the free ranging spammers have forced me
to take such measures to protect my "real" E-mail address.

I've been at this same address for many years.  Given how much spam I get
just from people accidently or ignorantly posting my private E-mail in
messages or forwarded E-mails to Usenet, I shudder to think how bad it
would be if I didn't guard it so closely.

Fortunately for the archeologists, I've been signing my messages the same
way for years.  ;->

Richard:

NIS (aka yp) is the de facto standard for such things in the UNIX
environment.  If you want something a bit harder to implement but with
more potential for compatibility then something like an LDAP server might
be more appropriate.  (This also makes it simpler to have NT/UNIX/Other
with the same username and passwords and a single point for updates.)

NIS can have issues on widely distributed networks, whereas LDAP usually
doesn't.  Just don't use LDAP for a general-purpose database.  Its feeble
backup and recovery methods will make that a disaster waiting to happen.

This is when that NetApp with the automatic 5-minute-old snapshots of your
home directory really pays for itself.

It's just a matter of time before a commonly-used linux filesystem
supports something like that.  (If there's one that does already, please

Then you know that if some idiot tarred up /dev/kmem inside the file
you just downloaded from www.hosemysystem.com, your lack of wisdom in
untarring it as root won't be immediately fatal.

I usually install it and then link it in as "gtar" so that the real system
tar is available for broken scripts that require the original.

I think the LVM (Linux Volume Manager?) stuff supports some form of

I have the beta of crossover, works great , installed office 97 under it
too:) 

Have you had better luck with Netscape or Mozilla ??

I do not use opera, sorry, but under mozilla and netscape it works
great, the trick is to have the dir for the plugins setup correct, 
also the error log  seem to /tmp/crosscover*. 

read the log, for me %95 it is I have an old socket file laying around ,
a quick rm then happiness returns :)

Nice job Cooper.  Good information.  Being fairly new to Linux, I learned a
few things.

Here are a few things I caught.  I didn't really check for spelling,
grammatical or technical accuracy errors as I figured others would be better
suited.

I hope you don't take offence at my suggestions.  I tend to be fairly anal
and critical when proof reading.  There were a few things that I thought
were not explained as clearly as they could have been and some, what I would
call, "scattery" paragraphs.   Being sort of a stylistic thing, I didn't
point those out but I can if you want me to.

Ok, here goes:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The first 2 figures were not really tied in very well.  No references to
them, or descriptions, etc.  As a reader, I found myself wondering why they
were there and what I was supposed to glean from them.  Particularly the one
with the VPN links.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In Section - 4.1.2 NFS
...NFS provides transparent access to remote servers on the network; NFS
shares look to the user the same as a local directory.

Consider revising this sentence to something like:  To the user, NFS shares
look the same as a local directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In Section - 4.2.2 Advanced E?mail Services
Advanced E?mail communications include online scheduling, group distribution
lists, and online scheduling.

Online scheduling appears twice.  FYI, I don't know Exim, but Sendmail also
supports group distribution nicely.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In section - 4.3 Web Server
This is in contrast to Microsoft IIE?s 22 per cent.

That should be Microsoft IIS.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In Section - 4.4 Print Server
Linux and Unix in general make excellent print servers; often handling
correctly
large print jobs (such as Power Point Presentations) to printers with
limited
memory. The Linux printing system is robust and performs well even with
several users connected to the system.

I'm not sure who your target audience is, but if you're trying to sell them
on Linux, I would really consider reworking this whole paragraph.  It's very
weak.  "often handling correctly large print jobs"...  What does it do with
them the rest of the time?  How does it compare to a NT or Novel based print
server?  Does it handle large print jobs going to printers with less memory
better than some other print server?  "...performs well even with several
users connected to the system."  I would hope a print server would perform
well with more that a few users connected.  Isn't that what print servers
are supposed to do?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In Section - 4.4.1 CUPS
Finally, CUPS is backwards comparable and supports both the BSD and
System V style print commands.

I think you mean CUPS is backward compatible...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In Section - 4.5.1 Oracle
Oracle has included support for their database line since Oracle 8i in July
1998.

I'm pretty sure Oracle supported their database line long before 8i.  Do you
mean they included Linux support...?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In Section - 5 Linux On The Desktop
Figure 5.3.3 is significant not only because it illustrates
Linux?s desktop functionality, but also because the system was actually
running
on a different system than the one from which screen image was captured.

The figure I think you are referring to (on page 17 in the PDF) is labeled
"figure 3"
not figure 5.3.3.  You might consider comparing the X11 architecture picture
you paint with Citrix or MS Terminal Server for the benefit of those more
familiar with that technology.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In Section - 5.1.2 OpenOffice
There are some tools absent from OpenOffice that you will find in
StarOffice.
One of these is lack of support for databases.

I would remove "lack of" from the last sentence.  If one interprets these
two sentences literally, it would mean that StarOffice lacks database
support.  I think you actually meant the opposite.  It's sort of a double
negative thing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Also in Section - 5.1.2 OpenOffice
See Figure 5.3.3 for and example of what OpenOffice looks like on the
desktop.

Is this the same figure referenced above?  If so, change to figure 3 or
change the label of the figure to 5.3.3.  The former would be more
appropriate as there is no figure 5.3.2 and so on.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In Section - 5.2.1 Mozilla
See Figure 5.3.3 for an image of the Mozilla browser on the desktop.

Same "figure 3" deal here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In Section - 5.2.2 Ximian Evolution
Ximian Evolution can function as a Microsoft 2000 client
with the purchase of the optional add?in, Ximian Connector. See Figure 5.3.3
for an image of Ximian Evolution?s summary screen on the Linux desktop.

What is a Microsoft 2000 client?  Do you mean a Microsoft Exchange 2000
client?
Also, same "figure 3" deal here.

The TLD ``.name" is not widely accepted. I'm guessing this is a domain

If you can expound a little on it I'd like to hear the gory details.

I'll guess it's some kind of subdomain unlike the common garden variety, in
that it is alternative, do you mean like Nirvana/Tool is alternative to
commercial bubblegum variety rock music?

Yeah, it does work under Mozilla, but not Opera.  Not sure why.

I now protect directories I never want to `rm -f *' by accident with this
simple trick...

    cd /dir/you/care/about
    touch '-i'

When the wild card is expanded, it treats the file `-i' as a switch :) No
more accidental `rm -f globfor *'.

NetApps rock the house. They're worth every of the several dollars you 
spend on them.

The Logical Volume Manager for Linux (LVM) reportedly has snapshot
capabilities. See part 7 of the LVM HOWTO, "Making snapshots for
consistent backups":

  http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO-7.html

There used to be a project called SnapFS. The author tried to emulate 
NetApp functionality in a free fs, but it looks as if the effort has 
died completely.

I forgot! I moved the DNS on this one recently to handle the load once I
publish. I will publish it up to metasource later this afternoon. 

The other two (three if your DNS resolves the .name domain) should still

Thanks for the replies.

I guess I was working towards the correct solution all along and just 
didn't realize it.  ;)  Now all I've got to do is reconfigure all of my 
machines (a project I've been neglecting) and I'll be set.

Thanks!

Hello fellow Linux people.

I am try to setup my modem so I can dial in and use myself as an ISP when I 
am out on the road. my problem is I cant test it effectively, only one 
phone line and if I am off site then I cant adjust my setting until I get back.

Is there anybody out there willing to help by dialing in and testing my

I suspect some of my problems to be;
authentication
routing to the Internet

From announce at Xpostit.com  Wed Jun 12 12:28:26 2002

Subject: [PLUG] Hi Candidate !  Our Resume Distribution Program adv.
Message-ID: <MDBrhPvFPOwsMJu4ayc00008382@toon.fws.net>

Dear Candidate,

Your email address was forwarded to us by a member of our network.  If you are 
still looking for a better job opportunity, then please read this email.  You 
have NOT been placed on a mailing list and you will not hear from us again.  
If you don't want this email, simply ignore it and accept our apologies.

I'm contacting you because your profile fits what many of our recruiters, from 
our association of over 10,587 recruiters, want to see.  Because of your background, 
we can help you in your job search, as we have helped many others in your field 
before.

Does the following describe your situation?
* You posted a resume on the Internet but haven't received enough good leads.
* You would like to uncover the hidden job market and access the best local or 
national jobs.
* You want to find more good recruiters that are targeted to your profession 
and industry.
* You have exhausted your networking channels and need a larger and newer network.
* You are concerned about confidentiality and protecting your identity.

If so, we can help.  XpostIt.com is a small, tightly-focused resource for proactive 
job seekers.  We have the largest database of top recruiters that have asked 
us to send them job seekers targeted to their interests.  We connect you to the 
right recruiters, en masse, the same day you enroll.  This "in their face" approach 
works because it's hard to get noticed on the Internet any other way.  

Mass Career Marketing
XPostit.com intelligently connects you to the recruiters across the country matching 
your profession, industry, and location preferences to theirs.  You can pick 
how many recruiters will see your resume.  On average, each job seeker's profile 
gets distributed to over 1,100 targeted recruiter connections.  Imagine the opportunities 
that are uncovered by our clients!

Are you lost in the crowd?
Did you know that there are over 20 million resumes, in hundreds of databanks, 
on the Internet?  And, over 2 million new resumes added each month!  "Waiting 
to be found" has never worked and, with the Internet, it especially does not. 
Of course, some recruiters will find you on the Internet (just as I have), but 
not the hundreds of targeted recruiters as with XPostit.com.

Our service helps you find the hidden opportunities even in your own back yard. 
We can also be used to uncover national and international opportunities too, 
if you are interested in them.

Our Database
Our recruiter database covers everything from the most specialized professional 
recruiters to professional generalists, independent professionals to international 
organizations.  We have extensive representation in most every industry and job 
function across the country.  Many recruiters are not posting jobs to find candidates. 
They are relying on their internal database, referrals, and our leads.  Our recruiters 
have profiled themselves in our system and have asked to receive our targeted 
job seekers.  We are exclusively 100% opt-in.  This ensures that they will read 
your resume because they are looking for what we send them.  We have worked very 
hard to develop this asset.  We believe it's the best!

Our Job Seekers
If you earn between $40,000 and $300,000 per year then our service is designed 
to determine which recruiters are right for you.   

So, if you are looking to find more opportunities, even in your own city, signup 
now for your membership and get connected to the recruiters looking for you. 
With prices as low as $49, you may select a service that meets your needs and 
fits your budget!  Nothing is as effective, at any price.

Best wishes in your career,
http://www.XPostit.com
Cross post it and harness the power of the 'net!

It's not necessarily the news gateway.  The list IS wide-open to anyone 
who sends a message to plug at pdxlinux.org, regardless if they're 
subscribed or not.

I've confirmed this, Sandy Herring has confirmed this, what more do we 
have to do to fix the hole?

I think we have to wait until Karl or an adequately empowered designee
gets some time to do it.

I asked Karl (the list manager) about this last week and he told me that
the list is open to non-subscribers because of the news gateway. That is,
is is necessary for the list to be open to non-subscribers in order to
accomodate teh non-subscribers who wish to use the news gateway.

In other words, the spam is a side-effect of opening the list to
non-subscribers in order to accomodate those who use the news gateway.

So the solution is to either figure out how to make the news gateway
workable without keeping the list open to non-subscribers or close down
the news gateway and close the list to non-subsribers.

This is the problem. If you have a solution or suggestion send it to
karl at microsharp.com and dmandel at microsharp.com

However, I don't think it is useful to just comment on each individual
spam with a one line top post. If you have a solution or opinion send it
to the list admin, otherwise, please just have some patience. In a
non-profit volunteer organization things rarely happen fast. The endless
back and forth about *each* individual spam is far worse than the spam
itself.

According to others in the list, it's possible to subscribe, choose the "No 
Mail" option, and then be able to post as normal to the closed list.

It seems to me that this would be the best option. Make the list closed, 
and have instructions posted (on the website, in a monthly posting to the 
list, etc) that include these details.

Please tell karl at microsharp.com and dmandel at microsharp.com.

I am not sure if they monitor the list so would see that solution (which
has been posted here at least once). I believe that they need to be told
directly of the solution and then we need to be patient and tolerate a few
more spams. This is especially true since Karl says he does not have time
to deal with the list.

Times of transition means that this may happen even slower -- it may be
the next list manager(s) who does it.

The key is that it will happen but it may take a little while. I think we
should ignore the next few spams and not bring it up again unless nothing
happens over the next week or two.

Oops... somehow my final comment got munged. I had deleted that last
sentence once I realized we're using v2 of `mailman', and wanted to add
simply that this problem can be solved - noting the guide also details
"Spam-specific posting filters".

Message-ID: <20020612214828.GB13987@geekfest.net>

Just did a quick test with wilco and texno (Wil Cooley and AJ Lavin) on
the plug-mmtest list.

Wilco disabled posting from non-members, AJ sent a couple of messages
via the news gateway AND via SMTP, and we got a few people from the IRC
channel to send messages from non-subscribed addresses.

The following mail was what was sent back to me when I posted from
home...which is where I'm posting to THIS list right now (and I
shouldn't be able to).

After a little more tweaking, the main list should be set up the same
way.

Ugh, I should have sent sooner, but I just plum forgot.  Many of you use
Perl, but if you feel such announcements are inappropriate, please let me
know.

Tonight, Todd Caine will be giving a presentation on POE (Perl Object
Environment).  From an introduction on perl.com
(http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/01/poe.html)

    POE is a framework for building Perl programs that lends
    itself naturally to tasks which involve reacting to
    external data, such as network communications or user
    interfaces. Programs written in POE are completely non-
    linear; you set up a bunch of small subroutines and
    define how they all call each other, and POE will
    automatically switch between them while it's handling
    your program's input and output.

Place:          Onsite! Technology, Inc.
Address:        333 SE 3rd, Portland, OR
Date and Time:  2002-06-12 at 7:00 PM

There will be a social meeting at the Rose and Raindrop
(http://nwbrewpage.com/orpubs/RoseRain.html) at 6:00 PM. The address is 532
S.E. Grand and it's about 3 blocks from the Onsite! Technology offices.

Just as a recommendation, Todd is an old friend of mine and former
coworker.  Very smart and well-informed.  Nice guy, too.

Never had a formal class from the guy, but we've taught each other a thing
or two over the years.

For a definition of the Turing Test wherein the baseline human is dumbed
down so far that a real person response approximates a phone tree menu.

Knowing MS, it's possible: just another routine redefinition of a commonly
accepted standard to fit their needs.

IMHO, the headers are all forged, with the exception of salmo's, which
gives as "subdimension.com" an IP number belonging to a telco in Brazil.
Also, if my memory serves me corectly, spam was not yet a problem in the
year 0102, as given in the timestamps of all four remaining headers. I may
be wrong, but I think this came from the spammer's SMTP client direct to
salmo. Were these the only received headers?

David,

  Yes, the only missing lines are "Reply to: " and "To: ".

  My understanding is that the domain names are easily spoofed in the HELO
and FROM lines, but that the IP addresses were accurate. Why would a spammer
forge a series of "Received: " lines when sending directly?

Thanks,

Rich

did you run ~/crossover/bin/pluginsetup ??

you need to have the plugin paths setup correct, make sure it works with
netscape 4.x. 


I believe that the interface has plugins have changed from ns 4.x to
mozilla/netscape 6.x.



When I get some time, I will see if I can get crossover to work with

  Still seems to me to be more effort than most spammers would invest. They
always spoof the originating domain name, but I'm surprised they'd spend the
time to come up with a bunch of phony hops. Heck, with that much effort they
might as well have a real job.

Because the software they use to spam does it for them automatically.

There are some pretty evil programs designed for Marketing.

But I am being redundant.

Rsync can be tunneled in ssh.

Something like

rsync -avz -e ssh username at foo.com:/dir/to/sync/to/ /dir/to/sync/from

If you use RSA keys w/ no passphrase, you can have this be automated, ie
no logging in. I'll let someone else debate the relative security of this
kind of setup.

Subject: [PLUG] New Install won't let me Telnet, FTP, or http
Message-ID: <002701c21298$07bdbf80$021ea8c0@nisse>

I've searched various archives, but I have not found the reason for my problem.  I am running a "server" in the closet as a firewall to my DSL account.  Previously, I was running an earlier version of Mandrake.  With that installation, telnet, ftp, and apache all were accessable from the inside by default (I didn't have to do anything or know anything to make it work!).  Since I updated to Mandrake 7.2 none of these services respond at all, even from an xterm on the machine itself (response to telnet is "telnet: unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused").  I am guessing that later versions of mandrake have become more paranoid so thay don't come with everything turned on like they used to.  That doesn't help the bumblers like me.


Some points:

I am running static IP's on the inside (eth1) with the server and two other machines (running DHCP to the DSL side (eth0)).  I can ping from the inside to the server, and through to the outside.  In fact all the ipchains stuff is working great as far as my internet access is concerned.

There is no guest account on the machine (would it be needed for these services?).


I read through http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds6-1/linuxsec.html  to try and check a few things, during which I collected the following information:

hosts.allow has a single entry for my subnet (ALL: 192.18.30.0/255.255.255.0).  hosts.disallow has a single entry of ALL:ALL.


I have HUP'ed xinetd a few times.  When I did it to inetd, it came back saying "inetd: no process killed"

I am assuming that xinetd is running rather than inetd.  However, etc/inetd.conf does exsist and includes:
ftp    stream tcp  nowait root   /usr/sbin/tcpd       in.ftpd -l -a
telnet stream tcp  nowait root   /usr/sbin/tcpd       in.telnetd



/etc/xinetd.conf is small enough to include in its entirety:
defaults
{
   instancees          =60
   log_type              = SYSLOG authpriv
   log_on_success  = HOST PID
   log_on_failure      = HOST RECORD
}
includedir  /etc/xinetd.d


In looking at /etc/xinetd.d this directory includes the following files:
wu-ftpd
time-udp
time
swat
rsh
rlogin
rexec
linuxconf-web
ipop3
imap
echo-udp
echo
daytime-udp
daytime
chargen-udp
chargen


/etc/services has almost every port open, especially the ones associated with ftp, telnet and http.

There is no /etc/rc.inet2 file

tcpd exists in /usr/sbin 



My head hurts and I hope someone can catch what is probably a simple ommission so I can get some rest.  Thanks for any help or direction you can provide.

Thanks,
Brian.

xinetd:

Karl,

    Please take care of this if at all possible.  Sandy is right.  We are
getting too much SPAM.  We need to restrict posting to members only
and we need to do this on all PLUG lists, ie. PLUG, PLUG-WEB, PLUG-TALK,
etc.  If you can figure out a way to authenticate news postings do so.
Otherwise, make the NEWs gateway read only.  I would help you with this,
but I can't for a week or so and I think this needs to be done sooner
than that.

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.42.0206122323570.25089-100000@well.com>

Hello:

I have been playing around with this for a while and I
still don't like the results.

I need to be able to take a pdf file, read it into something
where I can add stuff to it; write it out to a file (I don't
care what kind of file, as long as it can be printed); and then
print the file.

The pdf file that I am working with is an employment application.
It has blanks for name, employers, etc. They expect me to print
it, write by hand the information, and then send it in. I am
hopeing to figure out a way to read the file into something that
would allow me to enter my information in the blanks and then
print/mail the results in via snail mail.

I tried exporting the file to .ps (via the acroread utility);
reading the file into ghostscript to convert it into .pgm and
then reading that into xpaint. I seem to lose some detail
in the file and the tiny prints gets garbled up.

I tried to read in the file using gimp, but gimp is very
hard to work with.

I tried using xfig, but xfig does not seem to have any
capability to read in either jpg,pgm,tiff,ps, or any
other file except its own format. (Please tell me that
I am missing something obvious.

I currently have only linux (no windows whatsoever).
If there is some sort of solution that I have missed,
I would love to know about it.

As I am still looking for work, I don't want to shell out
the $100 for the commercial software that is used to make
the pdf files.

For any of those who are familiar, the pdf files are for
the OHSU employment application.

Thanks for any help

Mark Allyn

You might trry this-
I take them into a graphics program (Corel Draw) and place text over the blanks 
and then print. Works like a charm, and I don't have to edit their stupid files.

ALC is one of Ed Sawicki's projects.  Actually, it is his major thing.
Altho I've never taken any of Ed's classes, I've worked with Ed quite
a bit.  He is good and gives good classes.  I've talked with numerous
ALC students and most all of them give the classes high marks no
matter who taught the class they took.

Thus, ALC (or any other training program) may not be right for everyone,
but is right for many people.  ALC is a quality act.

Private computer instruction is expensive.
I haven't looked at prices in a while, but it seems to me that
places like New Horizons charge about $250 per day for their
low level classes and about $500 per day for their high level
classes.  I believe Ed's classes are much cheaper.

Actually, the price of this sort of education is a real problem.
Ed is offering one alternative that lowers this cost a good deal.
People like Free Geek are trying a different approach.
And I suppose I've been trying still other approaches.

Public colleges have often have larger classes than those in private
computer workshops.  They are also tax supported, so naturally they
charge lower tuitions.

More importantly, the type of education you get in college is very
different from what you get in computer workshops.  College education
should educate students in the arts and sciences and give them skills
that will last their entire lives.  Computer workshops are designed to
intensive instruction in some specialized field which may only be
useful for a short period of time.  In other words, you learn
triangle trigonometry in college and you learn to operate a card punch
in a computer workshop.

Yes, indeed there seems to be an interest in this.
Would you be interested in giving this at the general PLUG meeting?
You said you might now be able to do the July meeting.
Actually, we are going to need to move the July meeting to the
second Thursday of the month - July 11, 2002.
Could you give the talk then?
If not, how about September?  August is booked.

Subject: [PLUG] Motherboard sound
Message-ID: <3.0.5.32.20020613003605.00793860@mail.inetarena.com>

My old Linux box is down, so I'm building a new one.  My question arises
from the fact that I will be changing from an old motherboard to a new one.

Since I'm buying parts for a Linux (RH7.3) system, compatibility is my
prime concern.  My new box will be based on a Athlon XP 1800+ CPU and DDR
RAM.  The good folks at Pacific Solutions told me that the most common
Linux motherboard issue is sound drivers.

I am not a gamer and have been quite happy with my simple Ensoniq PCI128
sound card (SB-compatible) for about seven years.  It was supported by Red
Hat 5.2.

Should I get a motherboard without built-in sound (or with built-in sound
disabled) and use a simple sound card with known support for Linux?  Is the
driver problem due to the built-in sound, or is it due to the fact that the
most current Linux distros may not support the most current sound technology?

Thanks for your help.

Currently scheduled PLUG Speakers

   July 2002 - We need someone.
       The first Thursday is on July 4, 2002.
       I'm working with PSU to change this to July 11, 2002.

   Don Baccus <dhogaza at pacifier.com> of OpenACS is scheduled for
       Aug 1, 2002


After that things get vague

    Omer Hickman <the_lord_of_chaos at techie.com>
        Omer has volunteered to speak using PHP and mySQL to build
        web pages.  We still need to schedule him.

    Michael Hall <mph at puddingbowl.org> formerly of LinuxToday
        I have talked to him about speaking, and I think we could
        schedule him sometime.  I just haven't done it yet.

    Dan Frye
        He has been mentioned as a potential speaker.
        I may see him next week.  If I do, I will mention this
        possibility to him.

    Cooper Stevenson <Cooper.Stevenson at wahchang.com>
        Cooper has volunteered to fill in anytime we need.
        He has a great talk on LVM that we should probably schedule
        at some point.

    Zot O'Connor <zot at whiteknighthackers.com>
        Zot has also volunteered to fill in anytime we need.

    Doug Davis <mindglow at dsl-only.net>
        "Anatomy of a Network Attack"
        Doug will get back to us.
        We will probably schedule him for September 2002
        unless he wants July 2002.

    Ok, have I missed anyone?  If so, let me know.  Speakers are always
welcome.  And next, could people let me know when they would like to
be scheduled.

Well, it doesn't really work in NS4 either.  I get a strange error msg
about process being "truncated" and xanim error.  Out of my range of
knowledge, but I think you might be on to something.

I'm going to go out on a speculative limb here and suggest that perhaps
the problem is that many on-board sound solutions use short-run
proprietary chipsets (or single-chip solutions, more likely) that aren't
common enough for the community to develop useful drivers OR are designed
to run with significant software emulation under MS Windows.

A 2.4 kernel supports a staggering variety of sound devices, to my eye,
and if you include those supported by the ALSA project, you get nearly
every major device, current and antiquated.

I would suggest taking the extra few minutes to double-check the chipset
on the board against the supported lists (directly supported by the
kernel, its OSS modules, or ALSA) and just avoid anything that isn't
there.  If you have or can acquire a cheap sound card that is supported
and you're not an audiophile, then go ahead and get a board without sound
and use the cheap card.  I can't recommend the third option of disabling
the onboard sound in order to use an off-board sound card because I've had
terrible experiences disabling on-board features with some motherboards.  
It's not a sure-fire problem, but I just try to avoid the situation
entirely if I can.

If someone can loan me a fast hard drive (7200rpm or better, greater than
500MB), I can probably prepare a talk that would walk y'all through
building a complete GNU/Linux system from source.

I know there was some interest in that in the past.

I'm not making a promise, but I'd like to take a few hours and try to work
up a useful presentation.  Unfortunately, I don't have any spare hardware
at the moment to use as a demo.

Oh, and if I DO give this presentation (either in July or September or
later), I'll need someone to help haul my machine to the meeting and back.

Just trying to lay all of the risks out up front.

Oh yeah, I also spit when I talk and smell bad.

Subject: [PLUG] rdist
Message-ID: <6012481.1023955494083.JavaMail.root@monkey>

Some versions of rdist allow you to tunnel it over ssh, thereby making it
secure.

I usually use rsync (http://rsync.samba.org) instead since it has a huge
set of features including ssh tunnelling, compression, auto-bandwidth
throttling, auto-resume, and differential-only sending.  Overkill for an
/etc/passwd file, perhaps, but useful in other places.

Whatever solution you come up with, be sure it's immune to the zero-length
passwd file problem (i.e. transfer clobbers your file with nothing or with
garbage.)  It really sucks to have your only means of login destroyed.  I
encourage you to leave a back door someplace if you can, and test that it
works if the passwd file is dorked up.

Heh, I remember sending that OHSU application monstrosity several months
ago.  Never heard back.  Not even a "thanks for sending us that brick of
paper" message.  I figure it was their loss.  ;-)

You might try editing the raw PostScript file.  Not the prettiest way to
go about things, but it's definately in the UNIX spirit.  I'm sure some
poor fool has built a lisp PS-mode for Xemacs...

I recall seeing a Perl module that parses PostScript.  I have not tried it
though.  My motivation to save my DMV fill-in PDFs in a permanent form
gave out before I actually put it to use.

In any case I would avoid converting it to an image format.  It will not
look good when printed when compared to the crisp text of the original
PDF.

My experience has been that built-in sound tends to be done using whatever
sound chipset was the cheapest available the week the board was
designed.  As if that isn't bad enough, often they can't be disabled (or
even when they are, they aren't *fully* disabled.)

For linux, I would definately go brand-name modular and save yourself some
pain.  Unless you like pain.

Oh, wait.  You're a UNIX/PC hacker.  Of course you like pain.  ;-)

I just tried to convert a PDF document to PostScript (using pdf2ps)
(http://www.indianconsulate-sf.org/visa/visaform.pdf).  I don't know
anything about PostScript--I expected to find the text of the document
in there.  Did I do something wrong?

Based on my limited experience, I have to second this.  I have an Asus
A7V, with a built-in sound card that the AC97 chipset (?).  I never was
able to get this to work (not that I tried that hard--I already had an
Ensoniq 1371).  Fortunately, I was able to disable the build-in sound
card.  I have always wanted to learn more about Linux device drivers and
the kernel, but I have other priorities :-(

Paul,

I just yesterday bought an Amptron K7-830XLM with an Athlon XP 1900+ for
my workstation upgrade from Pacific Solutions. I'm running RH7.3 and I
just reran sndconfig and the onboard sound was detected. Since I was
upgrading I just dropped my old NIC in and I suspect the onboard LAN could
be configured as well.

I first tried the K7-841XLM and I could not get the onboard video to work, 
nor would it acccept a PCI video card (I tried two RH supported ones).

Both of these boards allow you to turn off the onboard audio in the BIOS 
if you'd like to keep your old audio card.

Keith

$10 says that wu-ftpd has a line
	disable	=	yes

change that to 'no' and restart xinetd

Looks like you'll have to create a telnet file like D. Cooper Stevenson 
said.  As far as http, at least in RedHat, it is not under control of 
xinetd, but rather started seperately in the runlevel dirs (/etc/rc.d/)

Either that, or install the telnet-server RPM, which adds that file, and 
some others. Then, change the "disabled =" line.

For a console app to change these things, try "ntsysv". Works in Redhat and 
Mandrake, others too.

The chkconfig utility that ships with Red Hat can be used to manage 
xinetd services, too:

  # list what chkconfig can manage
  /sbin/chkconfig --list

  # tweak /etc/xinetd.d/telnet to turn on telnet server and HUP xinetd 
  # to activate it
  /sbin/chkconfig telnet on

  # check syslog to make sure we got what we wanted
  tail -n 40 /var/log/messages

At that point, you can edit /etc/xinetd.d/telnet to add, say, 
host-based exclusions using "only_from" or "no_access" directives. The 
xinetd.conf(5) man page is helpful in that regard.

It's not obvious, but you click the 'Picture' tool, create a box on the 
canvas and a dialog box will come up giving you all sorts of options to 
import a graphics file.

BTW, xfig's built-in help is fantastic.

Subject: [PLUG] Apache.pm failed to load
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0206131119190.13485-100000@lukem.com>

I'm attempting to rebuild a webserver and I've copied over everything from
the old server that I thought was relavant.  When I try to start
Stronghold, I get this error in my stronghold-error_log:

Apache.pm failed to load!.

I've searched around on the 'net and haven't found anything that works for
me.  I've tried adding "PerlModule Apache" to the httpd.conf, but it
didn't make any difference.  The old webserver had Perl 5.00503 and 5.6.0,
as well as a site_perl directory, and I've copied all of those over.

Any suggestions on how to get this to work?
Thanks,
~M

This is probably it, any host not in your subnet (Do you have exclusive
control of the whole subnet?) including your internal subnet (I assume
it is a non-routable set of addresses) will be denied access by your
hosts.disallow.  To open everything (not recommended, but easy) comment
out the entry in the host.disallow, and change the host.allow to

ALL: ALL

The man page for hosts_access (at least that is what it is called on my
debian box) will give much more useful information.

RH7.2 with ypbind running.  For some reason, none of the workstations
need the "+:::::" entry in /etc/passwd for NIS logins to work.

No suprise that adding "+user:::::/bin/bash" to override my shell on
one workstation doesn't work.  What do you have to do to tell the system
to look at those plus entries?

Searched on google and found this page:

http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/guide/troubleshooting/_Apache_pm_failed_to_load_.html

Which may help.

What you have is a mod_perl setup that is failing.  I have never used
stronghold so I can't tell you for sure, but it sounds as if you either
need to install mod_perl, reinstall mod_perl, disable in the httpd.conf
(or whatever stronghold uses), or enable it.  Of course, its all your
choice depending on what your needs are.

Hope that helps.

Most on-board sound chipsets rely heavily on the CPU for doing most of
the grunt work that dedicated sound cards take care of, your PCI128
probably has more features and better sound quality than most on-board
solutions.  If you are capable of compiling your own kernel, being able
to disable the sound chipset is not really important (if the kernel
doesn't look for it, it doesn't get used).  The only drawback may be
that the IRQ won't be free to be used by something else.

Beware of the volatile mix of the VIA southbridge, on-board sound and
the Phoenix BIOS.  This combination has many problems and doesn't work
well under an OS that automatically detects hardware, even if it is
disabled in the BIOS, it is still detected, but broken.

My advice is to hold out for a board without sound.  You're going to end
up adding a sound card anyway.

Good Luck

glibc 2.x (for a reason I've never bothered to research) needs special 
syntax in nsswitch.conf. Try

passwd: compat
shadow: compat
group: compat

passwd_compat: nis
group_compat: nis
shadow_compat: nis

So far I've had good luck with sound chipsets on Motherboards.
Something like 3 for 3.  Laptops are another story...

If you are interested in "premium" sound then you don't want an
on-board chipset anyway.

I think it's best to go with a PCI sound card of some sort.

I'll split a room with you.
Did you plan on driving to LV from Portland?
I could provide the car, if you want to drive (we can split the gas cost).

Feel free to contact me privately if you want

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0206131539300.31896-100000@shaft.bitmine.net>

Yo.

In this environment, I'm building a kind of internal workgroup server.  
For various reasons (not open to debate), I'm using some old hardware and
have to use a binary distribution.  I chose Debian GNU/Linux (also not
open to debate), but because of past problems and the desire to use a
modern kernel, I chose the "testing" branch, codenamed Woody.

The system build went rather smoothly and everything appears to be up to
date.  I installed all of the important services and everything seems to
be working (ssh, cvs, bind, etc.), but then I decided that I'd like to
have a web server on this host as well.  For various reasons (of course,
not open to debate), I decided that Apache was the way to go.

However, when I suggested to the package manager that I should install one
of the several available Apache packages, the package manager told me that
it must back-rev Perl to an unacceptable degree (from 5.6.1 to 5.005).

Does anyone have Perl 5.6.1 and Apache running on a Woody system without
building either from source?

I'm certainly not opposed to building from source, but the system is dog
slow for such things and I was hoping to be able to rely on Debian package
managers to handle upgrades in the future.

Any help is appreciated.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206131431580.32406-100000@ns1.billmercer.com>

Pluggers--I've got a system that has a partition with that -other- 
operating system on it that I want to get rid of.  What I would like to do 
is

1. Nuke the ntfs partitions and make 4 ext2 partitions
2. Move the contents of my existing /tmp and /var directories to two of 
the partitions, then mount the new partitions as /tmp and /var
3. Mount another partition off my home directory for more space, leaving 
the last partition to plug in whereever I need space in the future.

I know or can figure out how to play with mtab/fstab to get partitions 
mounted where I need them, and I guess I can use linux's fdisk to get rid 
of the ntfs partitions, but I'm a little confused about how I go about 
reformatting them and getting them ready.  And once I have them formatted, 
would I just mount them at an arbitrary location to copy my current /var 
and /tmp directories over, then remove the current /var and 
/tmp directories?  And do I need to go into single user mode to do this 
kind of fooling around, so nothing important is trying to write to 
nonexistant files while the transition is taking place?  

Also, I currently have 3 primary and one extended partitions--two primary 
ntfs and one primary ext3 partitions plus an extended partition which is 
entirely occupied by my swap part at hda5:

hda1 boot partition 	ntfs
hda2   			ntfs
hda3			Extended		
hda4			Linux	
hda5			Linux swap (in hda3 extended partition)

Am I gonna run into any 
hassles 
because of he number of primary partitions?  I don't give a rat's tookus 
about remaining compatable 
with DOS's fdisk, but how many primary partitions can Linux's fdisk/mount 
deal with?

Another question--I have been booting linux off a floppy while 
doing the 
dual-boot thing--how do I rewrite the boot sector (or whatever needs to be

That sounds weird, maybe you need to check your sources.list and verify
the entries.  I have several woody boxes running the combination you are
wanting.  dpkg shows me this
ii  perl           5.6.1-7
ii  apache         1.3.24-3

Here is the sources.list on that box.

deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ woody main
deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ woody main
deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US woody/non-US main

I upgraded a server yesterday from Potato to Woody, and it is now running
the Woody Perl package 5.6.1-7 and Apache 1.3.24-3.  I didn't do anything
special, no building from source, etc., just a plain:

   apt-get dist-upgrade

Are you sure you have the latest version of testing?  I keep a full
mirror of Debian for x86, so the copy of testing I used for the upgrade
would have been current as of early Wednesday morning.

In that case, you can borrow a 4 gig.  It is an old Seagate Barracuda
(7200 RPM).  I paid about a kilo-buck for it in 1995, I think it was.
I'll want it back when you are through.  Too many fond memories to let
it go for good, besides it keeps me warm in the winter.

I'm just preserving this so we all keep the goals in sight when we give
advice.

If that wasn't just a typo or if you're already quite familiar with the
stock fdisk, ignore the rest of this paragraph.  I think you'll probably
have better luck with cfdisk than fdisk.  It's got a nicer interface
(full-screen, kinda like MS fdisk) for someone who wants to see what
they're doing as they do it.  Plain fdisk is really for scripts and piping
around variable output... a straight command-line utility.

And I'm sure you can be trusted with your own fstab.  Don't touch mtab,
though, that's all auto-generated.

GNU tar can be run with appropriate switches to preserve symlinks and
permissions.  I'm the sort of person that always has to look 'em up,
though, so let Paul or somebody rattle them off the top of his big ol'
noggin.

Eh... I wouldn't unless it was a production machine (with external users
that rely on constant uptime).  Just stop the obvious services, don't be
running X and try to be as atomic as possible when swapping the new /var
for the old one.

<edit fstab to reflect new mountpoint at /var for /dev/whatever, but
don't actually mount it>
<command to copy contents of var to new location>
rm -rf /var && mount /var

The end.

Well, according to the man page, fdisk numbers primary partitions as 1-4
and starts numbering extended partitions at 5.

But that's not reflected in what I see in your email.  Is that right?

Depends on which bootloader you're using.  If it's lilo, edit
/etc/lilo.conf so that one of the sections reads boot=<your boot device>
and run lilo as root.

Realize that lilo can be configured with its boot block on a particular
partition or in the MBR of the disk.  If you want lilo to install in the
MBR, you've got to give the raw device for the disk (/dev/hda instead of
/dev/hda[0-9]).


Anyway, that's how I'd do things on a home network.

Nuking is easy, making 4 partitions from 2 is more difficult, especially
with the extended partition being used by your swap.

You don't need to remove the contents of the current directories in
order to mount the new partitions (kind of nice for testing purposes),
that disk space will not be available to the root file system though.
 
 And do I need to go into single user mode to do this

Single user mode is a very good idea for this type of operation.

I would create a new swap partition (what is that command for creating a
swap file system mkswap?)from the free space left after the ntfs nuke,
change your fstab to mount the new swap partition, reboot, then nuke the
extended partition.  You'll then have something like:

hda1		swap
hda4		linux

and a bunch of free space to cut up into however many pieces you want.
This can be either 2 more primaries, or one more primary and an extended
with more partitions in it.

4, but one needs to be extended if you have more than 4 partitions.  I
personally like cfdisk better than fdisk, though I've had times when
cfdisk could delete a partition but fdisk (linux version, not DOS) was
able to.

This depends on your boot loader, please supply more information about
what program you will be using to control the boot.

Excellent.  Well, to abuse the public mailing list with more of our
personal chatter (damn this reply-to munging, I'm too lazy to go back and
figure out your real address and paste it in manually, but not too lazy to
type three lines bitching about it), I'll need to know how I can take
posession of said beast.

My bicycle should be repaired tomorrow (if I don't fall asleep as soon as
I get home), so picking it up in the greater metro area shouldn't be much
of an issue.

I should know by midweek next if I'll be able to present on 11 July.

Duh... dpkg is confusing me.  What was teh command line that yielded this

This is identical to my sources.list except s/woody/testing/ and
s/stable/testing/ on the last line.

I did have an issue at install where the wrong sources.list was installed,
but I put in the right data and ran apt-get dist-upgrade.  I don't believe
anything was even installed while those sources were active.  but the
data's in my database.  How can I purge the apt cache and download a fresh
list without harming the db of installed software?

I meant to say that cfdisk could _not_ delete a partition, but fdisk

Well it actually gives a little more data than I posted, but I did it
with this command.

dpkg -l | grep 'perl\|apache' | grep ^ii

I'm sure that some of the wizards on this list can do it better.  ;)

This may sound stupid, but you did run apt-get update? Nevermind... it
is. :)

What packages were you trying to install? Maybe you hit a package that's
there but is not updated yet. How did you do the update? 

Here is some info I got from apt the bot on OpenProjects #debian

potato->woody

apt> it has been said that potato->woody is edit /etc/apt/sources.list,
changing all non-local mentions of "potato" or "stable" (except
security.debian.org) to "woody" (examples: ask me about "woody
sources.list"). Then "apt-get update", "apt-get install apt-utils
debconf dpkg" and "apt-get dist-upgrade", et voila! Also, ask me about
"woody install warnings".

woody install warnings

<apt> woody install warnings is, like, ask me about "install xf4" if
your startx is missing, or ask about "libdb3 problem" if you're getting
libdb.so.3 errors, or try "apt-get install perl perl-5.6-base libperl5.6
debconf apt-utils" for miscellaneous perl issues, or "apt-get install
man-db" if man disappears, or until woody's released,
/etc/apt/sources.list must say "woody" and not "stable", so check that.

HTH,

Jeff

Well, here's something, anyway:
alexandria:~# dpkg -l perl apache perl-base
Desired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold
| Status=Not/Installed/Config-files/Unpacked/Failed-config/Half-installed
|/ Err?=(none)/Hold/Reinst-required/X=both-problems
(Status,Err: uppercase=bad)
||/ Name           Version        Description
+++-==============-==============-============================================
pn  perl           <none>         (no description available)
pn  apache         <none>         (no description available)
ii  perl-base      5.6.1-7        The Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister.

When I check the version of the perl package available (using dselect... I
can't get apt-cache to give me the info I want on that package), it says
5.005.  So clearly, the problem here is that the perl packages are showing
old versions and perl-base doesn't seem to provide perl (even though it
clearly does).

Oddly enough, on another system that was installed exactly the same way
(same floppies and everything), I don't have this problem (I just checked:

jeme at barrel:~$ dpkg -l perl|grep ^ii
ii  perl           5.6.1-7        Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report

So that's fine).

So it was something during the installation... like that brief moment
where I had the wrong sources.list, but didn't actually install anything
(though I may have run an update or something to modify the cache without
updating the packages themselves).

OK, I've done this a dozen times and I just did it again.

No dice.  Same thing.

Right.  See the output in my previous message.

This just appears to delete downloaded packages, no?  Does it actually
clean out the package database?

It doesn't appear to do so.

Just so's y'all know, the working system and broke-ass system both use the
same sources.list (OK, not the same file, but files with identical
contents).

Jeme and other helpful souls--I probably made the partition table for 
this puppy with W2k's fdisk (it's been a while).  What I've done so far is 
to juggle swap partitions to where my current swap partition is in the 
same physical location on the disk but is now a primary partition (I 
actually didn't plan to do it that way, but I found after making a 
new swap partition and turning it on I had my disk sliced up in a bad way, 
with non-contiguous free space that I couldn't put in an extended partition, so 
I juggled things around with a minimum of good planning until I had a 
usable setup).

I now have

(output from fdisk -l)

A mess I know, but workable.  All I have mounted right now is 
hda4 
with hda1 as the working swap space.  Now, what do I do to get my new 
linux partitions (hda5-8) formatted as ext2?  I know this sounds ignorant, 
but I am a bit puzzled.  Also, what is the preferred method for copying 
whole directories, since I wanna get the entire current contents of /var 
and /tmp into hda6&7, and presumably permissions and symlinks gotta stay 
absolutely the same?

I understand that once I have the formatting and copying done, I can 
update /etc/fstab and 
rm -rf /tmp && mount /tmp
or do i need 
rm -rf /tmp && mkdir /tmp && mount /tmp 
to make the directory where I'm a-gonna mount the new partition?

Many thanks,

Again, for the purpose of consistent, on-topic followups, I'll recap.

/dev/hda4 is mounted as /, /dev/hda1 is swap.  /dev/hda5-8 are new and
contain nothing useful.

What's /dev/hda2 again?

> Now, what do I do to get my new linux partitions (hda5-8) formatted as

Most basically?

mkfs -t ext2 /dev/hda5

If, for some reason, you don't have a mkfs script, you can do
mkfs.ext2 /dev/hda5
or
mke2fs /dev/hda5
and that should work.

Ignorance is ok.  At least you CAN learn.  There are many less fortunate
than yourself.

mount /dev/hda5 /mnt
tar clpsvC /tmp .|tar xlpsv /mnt

Should that do it?

I haven't tested that.  Don't trust me.

Heh.  Caught me there.  Yeah, you'll have to mkdir the damned thing first.

But as was pointed out earlier, you don't have to blow away the contents
before mounting something on top.  mount will just make the new mountpoint
and ignore any other pointers to data in /tmp that isn't at the new
mountpoint.  Does that make sense?

So you can have something like this:
Host:/$ ls /tmp
foo
bar
Host:/$ mount /dev/hdb2 /tmp
Host:/$ ls /tmp
baz
Host:/$ umount /tmp
Host:/$ ls /tmp
foo
bar

Dig?

So you can do the rm after you know everything works.

Well, I'm worried about the database being screwed.

Is it possible to just blow away the db without blowing away the list of
installed packages?

Subject: [PLUG] Reply from Sen. Wyden on S. 2048
Message-ID: <3D096582.415BD03@attbi.com>

Several weeks back we had a thread on the "Consumer Broadband and
digital Television Promotion Act (S. 2048)" in which a number of us
talked about contacting our elected national representatives. I sent the
same information to Senators Smith and Wyden and to Representative
Hooley. In each case, I sent my comments via the e-mail interface on the
respective legislator's web page. I received a snail mail reply from
each, although spaced a good bit apart. First came a letter from Senator
Smith, then one from Representative Hooley. Today I heard from Senator
Wyden.

In the cases of both Senator Smith and Representative Hooley, I received
polite, non-commital replys. Senator Smith's reply was pretty much a
form letter that simply acknowledged receipt of my comments.
Representative Hooley's reply restated my concerns, but was otherwise
non-coommital. Today's letter from Senator Wyden was better thought-out.
In 4 paragraphs, the letter not only restates my concerns, but also
states Senator Wyden's position. Here are the last two paragraphs of his
letter to me:

  The issue of digital content protection has raised significant
  questions about our copyright regime as we struggle to determine
  whether and how existing intellectual property laws can adapt to the
  changing environment in this digital age. It seems clear to me that
  the distribution of media over the Internet is an exciting development
  that we cannot and should not try to block. Like you, I am wary of
  having government dictate specific technology standards, because there
  is a risk of locking in an inflexible, one-size-fits-all approach. I

Subject: [PLUG] Editing PDF files
Message-ID: <233535696.1024027012141.JavaMail.root@monkey>

PostScript is its own stack-based formatting language, (Reverse Polish
Notation on HP calculators is also stack-based, to give you the feel for
it.)  Most of the stuff at the beginning of auto-generated PostScript is
meaningless headers, definitions that are never used, and a bunch of other
junk.

It *is* its own language, so unless you think it would be "neat" to learn
it, you're probably better off just getting the Adobe software.

Some handy links for more information:

Sorry.  Let me restate in terms that (hopefully) make sense in places
outside my own head:

How can I just blow away the list of available packages without losing the
list of installed packages?

I assume that regenerating the list of available packages (from only the
sources in my current sources.list) will solve my problem.

Both the "clean" and "update" commands to apt-get have failed.

clean only cleans out the repository of fetched packages, it has nothing
to do with the database.

update just updates the index of available packages

given what I remember from your previous postings, I would try running the
following set of commands in sequence:

   apt-get check
   apt-get update
   apt-get dist-upgrade

after doing this, if you wish to use deselect, after you start deselect,
first select "Access" and verify that it is configured to use "apt", next
run "Update" from within dselect, then go ahead and do your selections or
examine the configuration.

I *think* that "apt-get update" is effectively just downloading the
contents of some files on the source site to a file called
/var/lib/dpkg/available.  The "list of installed packages" is stored
in the "^Status:" field of /var/lib/dpkg/status.  If you've got a
"working" system to compare, you might try "diff"ing these files
between systems.

I don't think "dpkg -i foo" can damage your system.  If installed
packages rely on something that "dpkg -i" would mutate away, dpkg
should let you know about it.

So far, I have still struck out, even with all the good suggestions.
However, the "/sbin/chkconfig telnet on" resulted in a log entry that might
be the clue I need.  One of the lines resulting from "tail -n 40
/var/log/messages" reads as follows:

(date) (host name) xinetd[26042] service telnet missing attribute server

Does this give me a direction to look?

Thanks for all help so far,

Well, I'd say it's a good indicator of something going wrong.  The
server attribute in /etc/xinetd.conf tells xinetd what program to
execute to invoke that particular service.  Open up xinetd.conf with the
editor of your choice, and search for "service telnet"...see what the
entry for it looks like =)

Sounds to me like you don't have the telnet server rpm installed. What
does rpm -qa | grep telnet show you? Ive got to ask though...is there a
real need for you to use telnet and ftp? A better alternative would be
to use a secure alternative like ssh and sftp. Telnet and ftp send all
their info in clear text and shouldn't be used if you control the box (
which it sounds like you do) This is even more true if you offer these
services over the internet. Once the ssh suite is set up, it is
functionally the same as the insecure alternatives.

My experience was nearly identical, including the position paragraph

Hello Linux folkz,

Could somebody experienced in SQL DB answer this question.
Assume that all tables in DB have the same number of columns e.g.10.
What is better for DB performance to have few of bigger/longer tables 
or lot of smaller/shorter tables?
Thanks in advance for any responses.

Just in case anyone has followed this issue with any kind of interest:

I've determined that dselect is the problem. As
apt-get install perl apache
did the right thing with the latest available versions of each.

Now, to purge dselect.

Microsoft accidentally distributes virus

By Robert Lemos
Staff Writer, CNET News.com

update Microsoft accidentally sent the virulent Nimda worm to South Korean 
developers when it distributed Korean-language versions of Visual Studio .Net 
that carried the virus, the company acknowledged Friday.

Microsoft's flagship developer tools picked up the digital pest when a 
third-party company translated the program into Korean, said Christopher 
Flores, lead product manager for Visual Studio .Net. Flores stressed that no 
other foreign-language versions of the program were found to carry the worm, 
and he said the worm had not actually executed on any developers' systems. ...

You can use the ip address of the RH box, like http://192.168.10.10 if you want, 
it doesn't need a name, unless you want one. You must use the htp:// on the IP 
address for it to access by IP. You can enter the ip in hosts.conf on your 
winboxen so they don't need DNS.

  Well, that's OK. The only Korean export appears to be spam in any case.

  Can we now say that the Nimda virus is Microsoft certified and officially

you can do it with Gimp and save it as any format you want, or use the 
following:

xwd -root -out filename
# generates an X window dump

import -window root root.jpeg

The simplest method would be to make up a name for your webserver and put
it and the server's IP address in the hosts file on your Windoze boxes.
So, for example, your hosts file could contain:

myhappyfunserver	192.168.1.100

Then you can browse to http://myhappyfunserver to access your files.

To set a key to a execute a command when pressed, is window manager dependant.
You will need to post the window manager you're using.

Hello Matt,
I can't seam to find a file on my win box named host.conf or just
host.
This is a win2000 so is it in a different directory than windows like
it is on a win98 box. Or do I just create it in the windows directory

The file is called "hosts" and it's in some obscure location like
C:\winnt\system32\drivers\etc on Win2K, if I remember correctly.

Use the Windows search utility to find it on your Win98 box.

You did not say what Dist/ver or Desktop you are running.  I am running RH7.2 
with Gnome.  I just went through the menu [ Applets > Utility > 
ScreenShooter] to add the screenshooter applet to my panel.  It creates two 
icons in a box on your panel.  The left will give you cross-hairs to select 
any part of the screen and the one on the right will just select the whole 
screen.  It saves your selection to your home directory with a date/time 
stamp as a jpeg file.  There are other settings you can tweak, including 
adding a border, if you right click on the applet.  Hope that helps.

If they do,  I would sure hope they address the BASICS like this stuff:

The answer, as with most database performance questions, is "it depends".

If you are doing a lot of full table reads then the single larger table is
going to perform better.  If the accesses are indexed and fairly
randomized then the shorter tables can perform better.

The best answer is to try both and measure the performance given your
database software, your data access patterns, on your server.

Some databases provide the ability to simulate and/or test different
configurations.  (i.e. Oracle "EXPLAIN PLAN" and related commands.)

I usually use the Gimp with the single-window capture on about a 3 second
delay.  Start the timer, highlight the window you want and magically it
appears in the Gimp when the timer expires.

I always save screenshots as PNG files or a similar non-lossily compressed
format.  JPEG blurs the nice sharp edges of your screenshot and makes it
look like crap and will actually have a larger image size than the PNG
file for images with large areas of the same color.  (JPEG is better for
images with lots of tonal transitions and areas of varying color--
i.e. photographs.)

  Several ways: the GIMP, xv and others discussed on the list several months
ago. I prefer the GIMP, but all work equally well.

  Yes, there are many textbooks out on database design and structure.

  An (old) book that I found very useful is McFadden & Hoffer's "Database
Management", Third Ed. (1991). I'm sure the more current books are even
better.

  Unfortunately, this is the wrong question. The focus of this thread
appears to be optimizing disk reads (and, perhaps, writes) to the physical
file structure on disk. Every database book I've read, and all the
discussions in which I've been involved in the past couple of decades, focus
on optimizing the logical structure of the database; i.e., normalizing to
third or fourth Normal Form, and when to violate those rules.

  Physical -- hardware -- access will vary with the components installed.
Performance tuning is almost always a function of database logical structure
because that determines how data are accessed or written. Most folks select
the dbms backend based on features they require or want and allow that
backend to control the writing and reading of data on and off the hard
drives. The dbms programmer can then focus on the system schema and writing
the most efficient SQL statements to query the data and maintain as many of
Cobb's 12 rules for data integrity as are implemented in the software.

I have the following chunk of rules in my firewall:

I also have a summary of my logs emailed to me daily. I've been getting 
so many hits on port 1433 (some SQL server exploit thingy), that it's 
getting hard to ready the summary emails. I'd like to keep denying port 
1433, but NOT log it.

What's the proper way to do this?

I usually do PDF --(pdf2ps)--> PS --(pstoedit)--> SK or AI, then use Sketch to import and then place text and when done take it to PS or PDF again. Of course SK or AI could be SVG or FIG or whatnot and you use sodipodi or xfig or whatnot--and there's a whole diversity of whatnot. 

The quality varies in the pstoedit portion of the game seems to depend on which backend it is and how complicated the .ps is.

The main goal is to avoid rasterizing it, which even in the above chain is sometimes tricky depending on what fonts the PDF uses... under some conditions Ghostscript rasterizes certain characters for fonts it doesn't deal well with.

Doesn't the xfig picture import even from a .ps/.eps rasterize it?

Well, xwd is the canonical and traditional way to take screenshots.

But since everyone's spouting off about what they actually use, I'll share
mine, too.

I use an epplet (enlightenment applet) called E-Screenshot.  It does root
and child window shots with various fancy settings.

You must have picked the wrong DBMS, because it didn't maintain the
integrity of the man's name.  It is "Codd", not "Cobb".  So much for
ACIDity!  ;-)

I have a strange problem. I've got a Redhat 7.3 box plugged directly
into a DMZ port on a Cisco PIX. Everything is fine until I reboot the
Redhat box, then it refuses to bring up eth0 because it detects
another host using the assigned address, even though it is the only
box in the DMZ at this point. If I unplug the cable while booting,
then plug it back in, it works fine. This happened at quitting time
on Friday, and it's not a production server yet, so I let it go for
now. I'll put a sniffer on it to see whats going on Monday, but it
seems like the box is detecting a response from the PIX when
initializing the interface. Has anybody run into this before? Is
there a way to force an interface to come up with a certain IP
address, even if another host on the subnet is already using it?
The DMZ gateway is 172.16.1.65, the server is
172.16.1.66/255.255.255.224

Insert a line like the following into your firewall script before the
rules which log the packets:

  ipchains -A input  -i $EXTERNAL_INTERFACE -dport 1433 -j DENY

alternatively, you can probably configure whichever log reporting program
you are using (which sends you the email) to ignore the port 1433
messages.  Unless it is literally overloading your hard drive, I would be
inclined to not muck with the firewall, and just filter what is emailed to
you, otherwise you will be regularly tinkering with the firewall script as
each new exploit is introduced, and the more often you tinker with it, the
greater the chance of a mistake which leaves you open to attack.

Unplug the new server and try pinging 172.16.1.66 from another box within
your DMZ.  If you get a response, then you've either got another server
with the same IP address or you've inadvertently assigned .66 to your DMZ
interface.  I've worked a lot with the Cisco PIX, so let me know if you
need any help configuring your rules between the inside, outside, dmz, and
any other interfaces you might have.

Frick...  sorry...  I just reread your post and you said the RH box was
the only box in the DMZ.  Do a "write mem" and then "show config" and see
if you've got 172.16.1.66 assigned anywhere.  You can try pinging the .66
address from the PIX as well (make sure to specify which interface to
ping on).  Also, your "inside" interface should be at a higher security
level than your "dmz" interface, so you could try pinging 172.16.1.66 from
a computer on the inside, assuming you've configured your PIX properly for
the DMZ.
If you'd like, you could give me access to your PIX and I'll poke around
and let you know if I find anything unusual.  :-)

Me too!  If you don't want to install Gimp or ImageMagick, you can try
scrot.  Nice and light yet fairly complete.  I believe it uses imlib. 
Plus I like the attitude:  bug reports are mailed to

I hope this isn't too OT, but I figure you folks might know.  Is there a
way to exclude certain directories from a CVS checkout?  The local
.cvsignore files only work for local stuff, not directories in the
repository.  (For example, how do I check out the root without getting
CVSROOT along with the rest?)

Blow me off if this is too irrelevant.  Thanks,

  Any suggestions what might cause this loss of date and time? I keep the

CMOS clocks have a back-up battery.  Yours is having trouble.  I have
had this problem once on a motherboard.  They were using a weird
battery size so it was a pain to find a new one.

If you are lucky it may just be the connection to the battery,
i.e. the clip has lost some of its spring or some other mechanical
problem.

Is the littlebitty battery (for the cmos/bios/whatever) on its way out? 
I don't know if the modern laptops use the removable button batteries 
like the pcs of old... just an idea...
My desktop pc is doing it, too..changing to some really odd date and 
time...right now i'm just too lazy to remove the case cover and hunt for 
a little battery to be replaced...I just go in the cmos/bios (I'm too 
tired to care what it really is right about now) and update it.

  Thanks, Brian. I wondered if that was the problem. Now to dig out the

A little warning, some systems don't have a battery as such, it is built
into the chip that provides the real-time clock and is supposed to last
ten years, though sometimes they don't.  If this is the case, you may not
be able to do anything other than send the unit in for repair, in which
case I hope it is still under warranty.

Any thoughts on programming for a 64-bit cpu like the Itanium, other than it 
sounds like a speech impediment? Are there practical reasons? Kylix is 
strictly IA32, and may someday support 64-bit cpus. Then again, maybe not. 
gcc of course has IA64 and Alpha support. I'm wondering does it really matter 
in these days of distributed computing and low-cost clusters and SMP, why 
complicate things by introducing yet another complication? Just string a herd 
a them IA32s together.

Thanks,
Carla

Yep. We run into this at FREE GEEK all the time, especially on low end 
pentiums. Look first for a silver colored "button" battery. If you find 
it (and it's not soldered on), you're in luck. If you can't find one, 
look for a rectangular boxy dark grey square that may of may no be 
marked "ODIN" or "DALLAS". Example at:

http://dbserv.maxim-ic.com/images/timekeeping.jpg

Sometimes these can be replaced. Often not. (I saw one Sparc with a 
Lithium button battery soldered on as a hardware kludge.)

There may also be a jumper on the board that lets you hook up to another 
battery.

Shannon,

  I have not had a CMOS battery die in any of the previous laptops I had so
I didn't think of checking for a battery. Thought the CMOS might run off the
main battery, I guess.

  Anyway, there's nothing in the Toshiba literature that came with the unit
that says anything about a battery. They have all sorts of stuff for
Microsofties, but nothing more technical than "don't use it in the bathtub".
Anyway, a google search turned up a place selling replacement CMOS batteries
for $20 + shipping. I'll call them Monday. Only one place, too! I may buy a
main battery replacemnt, too, because the system will be 3 years old the end
of this month. Not in warranty, I'm sure. :-)

  Best portable I've owned: light, small, does everything I ask of it.

Thanks,

Rich

  According to the one web site I found, the battery is a green rectangle
with a waist and a pigtail with a plug on the end. I'll open up the one
manhole cover where I installed the additional RAM and see if that's where
the battery is hidden. I'll also ask the vendor when I call to order the
replacement.

  To put the K12linux and FreeGeek projects in perspective, here's some
information from the July Linux Journal that showed up today [1]:

	The government of Extremadura, a rural area called the poorest in
Spain, burned 80,000 cds with Debian linux so the discs could be distributed
as newspaper inserts.

	There are 670 schools in Extremadura.

	There are 32 technology centers in Extremadura.

	The expected annual savings to the Extremaduran community is $7
million.

	The number of government offices and schools expected in the

     You're welcome. Always glad to help top off answering machine

     Seriously though, it wasn't us when we went south. I have no idea
who it was. IF it was myself personally, I wouldn't be drunk as
drinking in teh car, even if you're the passenger, can get the driver
into trouble as if he / she was the drinker. That'd ruin everyone's
trip down.

     Yeah, we'd have no problems with you joining the caravan. If you
have a car and a FRS or MURS radio, as we pass we can radio you (we'd
know relatively accurately what time we'd be passing by out of
Seattle) and you'd pull onto the freeway and meet up with us, or meet
at a gas station off of the freeway and top off the tanks.
     If you have no wheels and we have an extra seat (only way to know
for sure is to call you on a cell phone before leaving or radio as we
get within range as there's last minute cancellations) we could meet
at a gas station or something and you'd hop in.
     Either way, best to have a FRS or hacked 2 meter ham radio to do
MURS so that we can radio if you're serious about it.

     I may have one, but odds are I'll only have a 12v adapter for my

Aah Yes I had forgotten about those parts.

Dallas Semi makes them.  That could be a big problem as a laptop is
very likely to use them to save on space.

Carla -

There's an excellent paper on this topic, entitled "The myths and
realities of 64-bit computing" [1].

To summarize, the purpose of 64-bit computing is to provide a
64-bit address space, so you can use more than 4 GB of memory. A
64-bit processor will not by itself provide any increase in performance;
in fact, the performance of your program will be hurt slightly because
your pointers must occupy twice as much space in the cache, reducing the
hit ratio.

The ability to perform single instruction arithmetic on gigantic numbers
can also be useful, in some rare applications. Usually however, 64 bit
data operands are disabled in favor of 32-bit, again to free up the cache.

I guess I have some general questions:

1) Should I have already registered or is it not too late to take care of
those things (if it's done at all)?

2) How much should one anticipate spending for the conference and lodging
(food I can figure for myself based on days travelling, etc.)?

3) Exactly what days would the caravan require one to be out of town?

Thanks.

That was a very carefully constructed kludge!  I bought a replacement
RTC module.  After installing it, I discovered (by searching the net)
that the clock silicon had been revised slightly, such that the 
firmware in my Sparcstation 2 didn't like it.  Thus I decided to hack
in a new battery instead.

ST Microelectronics is another major manufacturer of battery-backed RTC
modules.  You can buy their parts from Mouser (www.mouser.com).

You could put a global cvsignore file (not '.cvsignore') in your CVSROOT
directory, containing the pattern CVSROOT.

(Not that I've tried this, it just seems like it ought to work.)
The cvs.info file entry on cvsignore may contain helpful information.

Thanks, David, but I think that file works on client-side files, as with
the local ones.  And anyway, I don't want to make it impossible to check
out any such directory, just to supress it on some clients.  CVSROOT was
just an example.  I'm actually thinking of other things I've checked in.

I'm guessing it's not possible.

Shouldn't be a problem unless you have a default deny everything firewall
policy; I would still go to the site I gvae the link for;  because you can
get a listing of all the tcp/udp ports involved in the game.

Have you even tried yet? And if you have I assume it failed to connect to
servers?

Normally, you define modules in (CVSROOT/modules) that list which dir/s are 
aliased to a given name.

(can't remember if you have to create this file the first time or not.)  See 
the docs at cvshome.org.

Here are a few things I saw.  If there is anything here that I seem
wrong about, I probably am (I suck at writing. ;)).  

All in all, great job!  Things like this could be extremely useful tools
for advocates. ;)


---------------------------------------------------

First: you might want to add a footnote near the beginning explaining
that when you say "Linux" you are really refering to the whole system
(including end user apps) which is sometimes (and "more accuratly")
called "GNU/Linux".  Just say you are calling it Linux for the sake of
brevity.

---------------------------------------------------
Section 2 (Linux TCO):
"...cost is more than offset bye Microsoft's ..."
'bye' s/b 'by'.

Also, below table 1 you say: "Reduced Downtime - Linux reduces cost
through higher reliability."  We all know this is true, but it would be
nice if you had a footnote here pointing doubting readers to a study.
(Sorry I don't have any links to suggest though.)

--------------------------------------------------
Section 4.2 (Email Server):
"This catagory is largely comprised of E-mail and calendar sharing."
Here you mention "calendar sharing", but below in 4.2.2 you mention
"online scheduling".  I now assume those are the same thing(?) but at
first I was confused that "calendar sharing" didn't appear in 4.2.2.   

--------------------------------------------------
Section 4.3 (Web Server):
"Modules such as server-side scripting is installed with a minimum of
hassle." Perhaps this should be "Modules such as server-side scripting
may be installed with a minimum of hassle."
(change "is" to "may be".)

--------------------------------------------------
Section 5 (Linux on the Desktop):
At the bottom of the first paragraph you say, "In fact, entire windowing
systems can be exported from the server".  This is a little confusing I
think.  I think that what is meant is that the system (server, client,
network) can be set up in such a way that all of the applications and
the desktop environment itself is actually running on the server but
just being displayed on the client; but by using the term "entire
windowing system" I am not sure what that means.  Perhaps a better term
would be "entire graphical environment"?

--------------------------------------------------
Section 5.1.1 (StarOffice):
"uses XML file formats so that it's documents can be read across
multiple operating systems"

shouldn't that "it's" be "its"?  

--------------------------------------------------
Section 5.1.2 (OpenOffice):
"...OpenOffice shares many of the features of StarOffice, including
cross-platform document handling including Microsoft Office."
The use of "including" twice is a bit confusing, and maybe "Microsoft
Office" should say "Microsoft Office files".  

So perhaps:
"...OpenOffice shares many of the features of StarOffice, including
cross-platform document handling and the ability to read Microsoft
Office files."

--------------------------------------------------
Section 5.2.1 (Mozilla):
"Mozilla was written from scratch shortly after Netscape released the
source code for its browser."

But Mozilla has at least some code from Netscape Navigator - I believe
that it is only the page rendering engine that was re-written.  Also,
under 5.2 (Internet Apps) it says "Several full-featured Web
browsers..."; maybe the Mozilla sentance should read:

"Mozilla is one of the web browsers available for Linux ^15.5. It is
based on the Netscape Navigator code, although part of its core program
was rewritten in order to fix problems that Netscape was unable to. 
Mozilla features..."

15.5: Mozilla is also available for the Windows and Apple platforms. See
www.mozilla.org.

--------------------------------------------------
Section 5.2.2 (Evolution):

"...ability to run the application remotely..." This seems to be covered
in the first paragraph of Section 5 - maybe you should say "remember
that there is...ability to run the application remotely..." or something
to that effect?

--------------------------------------------------
Section 5.3.1 (CodeWeavers):
"CodeWeavers is an application that allows you..."
might more truthfully read:
"The CodeWeavers company offers applications which allow you..."

then later,
"Other CodeWeavers crossover applications include QuickTime, ShockWave,
Windows Media Player, and others."
could say:
"CodeWeavers also offers Crossover Plugin, supporting applications such
as QuickTime, ShockWave, Windows Media Player, and others."

--------------------------------------------------
Section 5.3.2 (VMWare):

" VMWare is a hardware emulator for the x86 based PC hardware. After you
install VMWare on your computer, clicking VMWare's icon will open a
window showing the memory count of the virtual machine. In effect,
VMWare emulates your computers' hardware. It is a platform to install an
operating system. It is like having a computer inside of a computer."

1) redundancy: "VMWare is a hardware emulator" and "VMWare emulates your
computers' hardware" (+ "computers'" s/b "computer's" maybe?)

2) In the second sentance, "window showing the memory count...": I'm not
sure what this means... maybe it should say "window showing another
Operating System running"?

3) "It is a platform to install an [OS]"... not sure exactly what is
meant here either. Maybe this is combined with the "window showing
memory count" so we have "A window opens, showing the 'computer' booting
up.  At this point, you can install another operating system on the
virtual computer"? Oh.  Judging from the following paragraph, I think
this is what is meant.  Maybe it'll all make more sense after #1 is
fixed. ;)

--------------------------------------------------
Section 6 (Open Source Advantage):

(3rd paragraph):
"It is not necessary under some circumstances to release your in-house
modifications to the rest of the world. You may find this useful if your
business climate is highly competitive. The Gnu Protection Liscence
(GPL)   (the governing license of most Open Source  code) states that
modifications made to applications covered under the GPL need to be
re-distributed only if that company distributes the code. "

"Gnu Protection License" s/b "GNU General Public License". 
Last sentance could be: "...modifications made to applications covered
under the GPL need to be re-distributed only if the modified application
is distributed."

--------------------------------------------------

One more... if you need 64 bit int support you will pay a heavy
performance cost on a x86 cpu.  SMP does not equal 32 x 2 = 64 bit
support (the amount of shared data needed is prohibitive).

Not really true.  For execution there is no reason why the memory
access needs to be limited to the data bus width.  I could easily make
my memory accesses take place on a 128 bit bus and fetch only 16, 32,
64, etc, at a time.  In theory the design might be a little ugly since
I now need to do 128 bit math for the program counter but it could be
done.  A 64 bit wide instruction set is pretty much a waste.

  Steve> 2) Single-threaded performance (SMP is great for

 Single threaded performance definitely benefits from moving the 64
 bit chunks around.  An interesting class of programs are the math
 intensive, or CAD oriented programs.  Heavy duty math programs are
 almost ALWAYS very parellizable (is that a word ?).  They typically
 do a lot of matrix math.

The future is in parallelization.  For math applications there is no
doubt in my mind that people should be focusing on lots of little
processes working together - and to a large extent they are - hence
all the hoopla about clusters.

As for the "lay person" bigger and better CPU's are already a dead
end.  Who the hell needs a 1.8GHz P4 for word processing, or instant
messaging ?  Even BillG is starting to have trouble generating enough
code bloat to slow down modern processors.  The only reason I've ever
upgraded my system was to crunch FP faster.  As far as usability and
day-to-day use I could get by with a K2-233.  The boost in HD
performance has really made the difference for everyday use.

More performance for the 3D graphics world still has lots of life left
in it.  Visualization is very BW and computationally expensive.
Again, graphics are also very parallelizable.

Bottom line is that Intel and AMD need to put out bigger and better
chips strictly for profit margins, and they desperately need to make
people think that they need them - but they don't.

Subject: [PLUG] Samba as a print only server
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206170009340.24730-100000@antares.mpcu.com>

I've been asked to setup what is essentailly an end of life pc (P133) as a 
print server with one locally laserjet on lp0.  Its been awhile since I've 
touched samba and the changes, well, are dramatic.  A phenomenal amount of 
functionality has been added.  In going thru "Samba-HOWTO-Collection" pdf, 
the focus seems to be integrating into  MS-Windows Domain structure.  In 
my case, there is a PDC (NT 4) but as this host only will be doing print 
serving I don't see a need to configure for "normal" user authentication.  
The are no restrictions as to who can print using this network resource.

My question stems from the changes that the docs are saying to do to 
/etc/pam.d/ with respect to supporting winbind.  The doc says make changes 
to /etc/pam.d/* .  In peoples experience, is this really necessary?  Seem 
overkill to me.  Is winbind even the right path to persue?  

/etc/pam.d/* has 66 items.  Egad.





One tangential question.  Is there such a thing as a "loopback" for an AT 
keyboard plug?  This would allow a socket 7 motherboard to boot without 
whining about a missing keyboard?

I wonder how much $ we could get in donations?  It could definitely be
worth it if we ended up with some money. ;)  


It seems to me that PLUG does a great job of supporting PLUG (current
Linux/Unix users).  What PLUG doesn't seem to do as good a job of is
converting lots of M$ users to Linux (please forgive me if I'm wrong).

Two benefits I see of having an "official" organization:

1) $$*.  With this, we can buy hardware (including projector) and
(possibly) speakers from afar; with those two things might come more
people to meetings.  From this, we have more $.  And eventually, with
more $$ we can also do a variaty of advocacy (we can do it now, but not
certain types).  We could help schools buy huge Xeon systems so they
could convert old labs to K12LTSP Linux Labs.  We could buy Linux or
Linux-related books to put in both public libraries and school
libraries.  We could buy ads in the paper, or cool posters (placed in
college campuses or any other place lots of possible converts hang
out).  We could buy flags for rallys and protests ... (ok, you get the
picture.) ;)     

2) (better?) Public relations.  Currently, we all know (or can figure
out) who to go to if we want to talk w/ the "main guy" begind the group
or the server or ...  But the media doesn't.  If KGW wanted to do a
Linux-related story, they might have better luck getting our perspective
if there were an "official" PR person listed on the website or
something.  If PLUG decides it has issues with current bills, we could
have the "PLUG President" call up the senator and say "I represent PLUG
which has 1000 members and we don't like House Bill 10032".  This is
also more possible if we have "official members" (or a count of how many
there are on the PLUG website).  


So it seems to that if we care about advancing the state of Linux
related things and increasing the number of people using it then having
plug be an "official" .ORG would be helpful.  If we can do these things
without bothering with "official" .ORG hassles (and we want to do these
things) then thats fine w/ me. :)
 

*: Eventually, after everyone in portland is member and we have lots of
$$, we can pay our unemployed members to write us some nifty software.

As a member of LUGOD up to a week ago (new job here in PDX), I can
say that we definitely benefitted from our 501c7 status (though IIRC the
treasurer had to deal with some interesting tax issues).

LUGOD would typically make decent scratch from donations, both at meetings
and through various other outlets (I was a member of the LERT project,
where we'd accept donations for coming out to a person's house to fix a
Linux problem that couldn't wait until the next install-fest).
Donations from businesses also helped a lot (demo computer from VA
Linux/Software/Whatever Larry's calling it this week, books from
O'Reilly, etc).  Having something to present to businesses seems to help
loosen the purse strings.

In my opinion, LUGOD does benefit from its organization, but what it
also benefits from is the dedication of individuals like Pete Salzman,
Bill Kendrick, Henry House and several other individuals whom I know I
should mention but don't have the space...  They throw a lot of their
free time into the LUG.  That, and the small college town of Davis has
its advantages, as its usually easier to meet in a central location that
is convenient for all involved (no freeway traffic to battle for most of
us, though there were a few individuals who came from the Bay Area and
parts of Sacramento for meetings).

Anyway, sorry for a rant as my first formal post to the list.  Hope to
meet some of you in RL at the next meeting!

Subject: [PLUG] Converting MS SQL to MySQL?
References: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0206161929250.25327-100000@lukem.com>

I believe there is a wizard in MS SQL to both dump data into text files and
automatically generate your db creation scripts. In MS SQL enterprise
manager,
you right click on the db you wish to use. In 'All Tasks' you'll see two
options: generate SQL scripts and Export data. It should be fairly easy then
to import data and structure into MySQL

Even though most of us are happy with the current speakers, bringing in
"big" speakers has the advantage that it might bring in the Press too.

Also, are there any PLUG members here who are too young for beer and
would like to go hang out somewhere where we could just have root beer
and talk?

Thanks,

Mark, Peter - Check over on www.col-ed.org for the grants currently
available.

I was looking last year for just such grants and there were two rather large
ones that had just closed for bidding,  but it may be that there are some
new ones open.

You ideas make sense to me.

The bigger the better, speakers are very important to the overall sound
quality.  Especially if all your amps go to 11,  like mine.

The message:

  "forward /var/spool/mail/.forward: Group writable directory"

Showed up in the log of my mail server this morning. I've never
seen this before. Can anyone enlighten me as to what this might
mean. There is no such file there now. /var/spool/mail is owned
by the user "mail" and has, itself group write permissions. So,
I suppose this could be a temporary file created by either root
of mail. I'm just trying to understand if this is anything to
worry about.

This is RedHat 7.2 / Sendmail

I have tried, and it fails to connect.  I do need to check my firewall.
I got lucky and my VPN works through my router, but not much else.  I'll
check that link you sent to figure out my firewall policy.

Thanks for your help!

Shouldn't be a problem unless you have a default deny everything
firewall policy; I would still go to the site I gvae the link for;
because you can get a listing of all the tcp/udp ports involved in the
game.

Have you even tried yet? And if you have I assume it failed to connect

Lord knows we could cobble a group of "revenge of the nerds" quality

<snips>

LOL!  And now I'm actually wondering if that's really as insanely far
fetched as it sounds.


I think I'd be suprised if there WEREN'T enough musicians (of varying
degrees, of course) on this list with enough equipment between them to do
exactly that, if they were of a mind too.  Hell, I'd do it.  Sounds like
fun!

OT - All of a sudden I'm actually curious how many there are, and what
they're into.  That's pretty OT, and something for PLUG-Talk.  But it's
weird... most of the people I know do both computers AND music.  Maybe it's
just me, but almost everyone I've played with in YEARS have been IT types...
and not the paper-mill sorts, either.

So... any volunteers for the PLUG band? :P

  Here is a typical session as seen in /var/log/messages. Ignore the date

and here:	Mar 26 04:42:39 lemna chat[870]: send (<passwd-removed>^M)

  Does anyone here have insight into what might be happening?

  Alternatively, what can I do to try to generate more information that
might yield a reason for the lack of connection?

TIA,

Never had a problem with the default setup you describe. It should
'Just Work' (c). Got any firewall rules in place? Make sure they
allow UDP port 7777 through.

If you want to host a game, you need to modify your NAT to forward
UDP ports 7777 through 7799 back to your workstation. This will allow
you to serve about 20 connections, extend the top of the range if you
need more.

Message-ID: <20020617113916.A29911@sharky.dyndns.org>

Has anyone ever had problems using ssh to connect from Linux to Solaris (that is, OPENSSH to Solaris SSH?).

I have a ~/.ssh (which is NFS mounted on both Solaris and Linux) which has:
id_dsa (private key encrypted with DSA - I'm pretty sure both SSH's support this)
id_dsa.pub
authorized_keys (which is "cp id_dsa.pub authorized_keys")
known_hosts

Does anyone know if the Solaris SSH server expects diferent files?

Thanks,

~Peter

Okay, Ed Sawicki and the Accelerated Learning Center (ALC) have now 
scheduled the Linux Networking Course. So far,  Carla Schroder and I have 
committed to taking the course (and several others have expressed 
interest). We need a total of six people to sign up for it to be viable 
for ALC to run the course. I really hope that at least four more people 
sign up for the course!

Dates: Three Thursdays in July - 11th, 18th, and 25th.

Time: 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM

Place: Novell's Portland office. You can find directions and a map here:
http://www.panug.org/meetings/index.htm#direct

Course Outline: 
http://www.alcpress.com/training/courses/linuxnetworking.htm

Text: ALC gives a textbook to each student.

Cost: $325

How to register: Call ALC's office at 503-635-6370

I consider this course an experiment of sorts. ALC runs these courses all 
over the country (charging $595) but was reluctant to run the course in 
Portland because of concerns about enrollment. I had to lobby a bit to 
persuade them to run the course in Portland.

If this course is a success in terms of enrollment, then it is much more 
likely that ALC will regularly run Linux Networking here in Portland. In 
addition, it is more likely that ALC will run Apache Bootcamp, DNS 
bootcamp, Linux System Administration, etc. Since Portland is home to ALC 
we will likely get fairly substantial discounts on the cost of each course.

I've never taken a course from Ed but I have heard from several people 
that he is an excellent instructor. I look forward to this course. It will 
be a lot of fun.

Hey, all.

Once again, I find myself in a position where binary distributions with
their wizards and configurators befuddle me.

Can someone give me the very high level overview on what needs to be done
to build a new installation of Debian "testing" on a second drive (in a
system with another installation of Debian "testing" on the primary
disk) using a filesystem supported only in 2.4?

I can't get the bf2.4 boot floppies to work, but I figure that since I
have a running system, I don't need to do boot tricks to run the install
scripts.

Thanks for any input.

J.

Until the very recently released version 9, Solaris never shipped with 
ssh or sshd. Admins always had to build/install them by hand (or via a 
package from a source like sunfreeware.com).

So chances are the sshd in question doesn't do protocol 2.

What does 'ssh -V' report on the Solaris machine?

ssh: SSH Secure Shell 2.4.0 (non-commercial version) on sparc-sun-solaris2.7

I'm not sure if that is the version from ssh.com.  It might be.

I'll be there for sure. It's a good price, and Ed is a great teacher.

Compare even the un-discounted cost of the course to New Horizons and other 
big outfits- they be much more expensive.

I believe you are correct.  Personally, I've seen anonmolous behaviour 
when going between openssh and SSH.  We choose the openssh route for all 
linux and solaris hosts.  Just checked with www.sunfreeware.com and they 
have packages for Solaris 2.7 and 8.  I'd recommend using them.

Thanks.  Maybe I'll try to convince our sysadmin to do that. ;)

I'm not positive, but this doesn't seem necessary, since you will be
setting it up as a guest account that doesn't require authentication.

This I know more about, you will need to change the BIOS setting to
ignore keyboard errors (or all but disk errors).  Linux doesn't really
care if there is a keyboard present or not, it just states that
something is wrong, but continues booting.

I didn't know that Solaris had their own implementation of SSH. I always 
use the openssh distributed from www.sunfreeware.com. In that regard, they 
are identical as far as what files each explect, assuming a similar build 
configuration.

I'm certainly not a gimp whiz (I suck actually), and if there is a better 
tool for this, I'd love to know.

Trying to create an 11x17 canvas and paste several jpeg photos onto the 
canvas so I can print then cut out the "prints" with scissors.  Want to be 
able to rotate/size the images to fit as many as possible on a sheet

I start with the correct size canvas, but when I paste an image, gimp tries 
to make it fill the canvas.  When I try to resize (shrink) the image, the 
canvas also shrinks.

Briefly looked at ImageMagick, but it didn't seemed geared toward this kind 
of thing.

Of course, I just figured it out.

Open each image seperately, scale, copy, paste into to big one.  Cool.

Could be someone's not sarting the ppp daemon.  Does you ISP
automatically start a ppp connection?  Do you need to issue the command?

   In this day and age of MS Windows I don't think this should be
happening so you should check your /etc/ppp/options file to insure noauth
is in there.  Strange as it seems I've seen the same error when it was an
authority issue.
   Also depending on how your connection was configured, redhatppp, 
Linuxconf, etc. you might need a noipdefault in the file also.

Message-ID: <20020617145613.C21077@dalsemi.com>

I don't know how often y'all read Slashdot, but this is pretty interesting:

http://slashdot.org/articles/02/06/17/1651231.shtml?tid=103

Basically, the policies of a county in Arizona prevent it from doing
business with people or companies convicted of violating county, state
or federal law.

So while the penalty phase is ongoing (and of questionable value), why
not press the issue and see if we can use our own laws to get our duly
elected government to deal Linux/BSD a hand in the game?

Sun didn't ship its own port of OpenSSH until Solaris 9, which I'm now 
running at home:

  [heinlein at irvine heinlein]$ uname -a
  SunOS irvine 5.9 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Blade-100
  [heinlein at irvine heinlein]$ ssh -V
  SSH Version Sun_SSH_1.0, protocol versions 1.5/2.0.

It's definitely OpenSSH:

  [heinlein at irvine heinlein]$ strings /usr/lib/ssh/sshd | grep BSD   
  @(#)$OpenBSD: sshd.c, v 1.132 2000/10/13 18:34:46 markus Exp $
  ... 44 more entries deleted ...

The rcs info indicates that Sun ported the version current as of early 
2001, but it's not immediately clear to me what they did or didn't 
patch since that time.

  I'm wondering if there's something in the phone itself that's

Can you login via a shell dialup?  That's where I would start.  Once that
is working, I would try starting up ppp manually from the shell prompt.

Hmmm.  Wasn't aware that ibiblio.org did that.  sunfreeware has been 
fairly consistent for our needs.  Beyond that, we generate our own package 
add files when we need to.

Aye.  there is a remote exploit using protocol 1.  I consistently see

Bummer, since the kernel isn't even initialized at that point, it can do
nothing to help.  If a BIOS upgrade is out, then the only option is to
leave an old keyboard plugged.

galen,

  Using minicom, I can dial in (using the same phone number) and the ppp
connection is apparently started automatically. All I/we see on the screen
is gibberish. The assumption is that Aracnet's trying to establish a ppp
connection with minicom.

  Is there a different approach? I'm always open to learning more.

Thanks,

I seem to remember hearing/seeing something about creating a jumpered or 
shunted keyboard plug.  I'll look around.  Any electronic wizards out 
there?

I recommend reviewing the ppp howto.  In particular, Chapter 17 is relevant
for your situation.  http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/PPP-HOWTO/manual.html
Failing that, you might consider asking tech support at aracnet to
temporarily set your account for shell access.  In that mode ppp will not
automatically start on the remote end.  This assumes aracnet will allow
a shell user to manually start ppp.

BTW, I'm operating from memory on this.  It's been about 3 years since I
did this myself.

I've had this issue before.  There are devices out there called ghosts
that "fake" a keyboard but they are hard to find.  Blackbox sells serial
mouse ghosts at the moment.  If you find a keyboard one please let us

Try setting the "record /var/tmp/some_file_name" option in your ppp
options file, this will allow you to record the entire session at the byte
level with timing and everything, then try connecting again with ppp.
Once your session has failed, use the pppdump command (I think it gives
the most useful display with the -p option) to display/interpret the file.

NOTE: with regard to the LCP timeout, LCP is a low level protocol used for
managing the PPP link, the timeout indicates that when your side made a
request to your ISP's side of the link, it didn't get any response.

Have you tried wvdial? I use it on all my boxes and it works great --
takes all the brainwork out of dial-up. It seems to be included with
Red Hat, so you probably have it on a CD somewhere. I can't see the
point in setting up PPP by hand unless you've got a special situation.
It looks like your is a special situation, but I'd try the lazy way,
anyhow. :-)

LOL!  And now I'm actually wondering if that's really as insanely far
fetched as it sounds.


I think I'd be suprised if there WEREN'T enough musicians (of varying
degrees, of course) on this list with enough equipment between them to
do
exactly that, if they were of a mind too.  Hell, I'd do it.  Sounds like
fun!

OT - All of a sudden I'm actually curious how many there are, and what
they're into.  That's pretty OT, and something for PLUG-Talk.  But it's
weird... most of the people I know do both computers AND music.  Maybe
it's
just me, but almost everyone I've played with in YEARS have been IT
types...
and not the paper-mill sorts, either.

So... any volunteers for the PLUG band? :P

Well I'm a country/country rock/rock guy that plays guitar and sings.

Thanks all-
I found that the telnet module (client-side) is all that was installed.
Apparently, my previous installation used the older telnet module that
performed both client and server services.  The new installation only
installed the telnet module.

After I installed the telnet server RPM I found that it still didn't work.
It wrote a config file called "telnet.conf.newRPM" (or something like that)
rather than replacing the old telnet.conf (apparently both the client and
server modules share the config file).  Once I did some deleting / renaming,
so it would use the new conf file, then it started to work.

Thanks again,
Brian.

Yes, Unreal (not Tournament) is a pain, but that's not what he was asking

Subject: [PLUG] weird NFS behavior
Message-ID: <20020617213911.A30263@sharky.dyndns.org>

Has anyone seen this before (and been able to fix it?):

kernel: nfs: task 25171 can't get a request slot
kernel: nfs: task 25172 can't get a request slot
kernel: nfs: task 25173 can't get a request slot
...

I'm on a Redhat 7.3 (kernel 2.4.18-3) machine, mounting /home over NFS from
a Solaris 7 server (not sure how to tell nfs version?).

It seems like something new (this problems) in the latest Linux kernels
but I'm not sure.

Thanks,

~Peter

The FAQ at nfs.sourceforge.net mentions this, though I don't know if
the answer applies to your situation.

Thanks.  There were a couple things on the FAQ it could've been.  Either
lots of collisions (quite likely) or soft mounting (works ok for
solaris/solaris but not linux/solaris).

Message-ID: <1024373959.15236.16.camel@alexlinux.qwest.net>

I have a spare machine just sitting around and I was wondering how hard
it is to dual boot several different Linux distros. I am currently dual
booting Mandrake (I know, "newbie") and 98se (for games only). That was
easy but I haven't found much of anything regarding getting various
versions of Linux on the same box. Any pointers or websites I might have
overlooked would be appreciated.

I'm in a one man group.  [subtend].  I play goa/psytrance electronic
music.  I've got a bunch of synths and drum machines.  I also have a
pair of Mackie SRM450's if PLUG needs them for a speaker (person).

Wow.  Your music (what I've heard so far) is awesome. ;)  I've always
wanted cool music to play when I start/stop my computer... maybe we
could do some music for a Linux "audio boot".  Actually, I wonder if
that would be useful to blind people? (They could tell their computer is
ready when the music stops or dies down.)

Unfortunatly, I can't say I do much more than pound out stuff on the
piano (which only occationally sounds good, and almost always only to
me). ;)

Once you have spare room it shouldn't be to hard.  Usually Lilo or Grub
is installed in the MBR of your hard drive.  If you wanted to add
another distro, just tell it to place its boot program  in the beginning
of the partition you installed that distro in (e.g. hda5 or something)
and then tell mandrake's lilo.conf or grub.conf to boot Debian (for
example) from /dev/hda5.

i'm tired, so if that didn't make sense or isn't enough info to help ya,
email me again and I'll see if i can dig up some links.

Probably not as much from people on this list since they've presumably
already got linux working?  
But I bet middle schools - college students would be interested (well,
the technically inclined or poor at least).  Gamers if they want to run
servers.  Maybe go down to Salem and try to help some politicians
install it on their PCs.  Seriously. ;)

Hmmmm....Lots of possibilities...

Are you interested in running different Linux Kernel Versions?
Or running different Mandrake Versions?
Or running different Distributions?

As for Kernel Versions, LILO and GRUB offer the ability to boot under
different kernel versions easily.

Different Drake Versions:  Sorry not a 'Drake fan.

Different Distributions:  
		Keep the Home partition the same across all distributions.
		Use the same swap and tmp space.
	
Partitioning examples:
		
			hdx1	swap
			hdx2	tmp
			hdx3	home
			hdx5	root (RedHat)
			hdx6	root (Drake)
			hdx7	root (Debian)

Jeff,
	I would like to run several different distributions (i.e.
Mandrake, Redhat, Debian, Slackware, etc.) I assume that it would end up
not just different distributions but also different kernel versions as
well. I am just interested in playing around with the various Linux
versions to see if I like one better or worse than MDL and to explore
the GUI's as well. I have in the past used RedHat and Lycoris (hated it,
sorry to anyone who uses it) and basically would like to tinker and
learn about the other distributions without having to reload everytime I
wanted to try a new one.
	Not sure if this is making sense as it's late and I wrote this right
before I went to bed.

Isn't there a group called the Blue Group (Linux newbies)? If you hold an 
install fest, then you might want to promote to that group as well.

Also, PLUG currently holds Saturday clinics which include install 
instruction. You might want to join up with them and hold your workshop in 
conjunction with their monthly Saturday clinics. The clinics are normally 
on the third Saturday of the month at clinics Riverdale Elementary School. 
Here is a web site:

Mike,

Sounds like you have a user with $MAIL set to /var/spool/mail rather than
/var/spool/mail/$USER - either that or $USER is null for some user.

Chris Wright from wirex will talk on:Linux Security Modules (LSM).


Meeting is at 7:00 pm at It's a Beautiful Pizza on Belmont

Directions:

         East on Belmont to Zupan's Grocery, then find a place to
         park other than Zupan's lot. Pizza is two doors east of
         Zupan's, on the North side of the street. (They may be on
         the south side of the street; they are moving, but have
         promised that there will be space for us to meet in.)

[They are more likely to be on the south side now]

         BUS: #15    http://www.tri-met.org/schedule/r015.htm
Belmont
                     10 frequency (east/west) 3:30 to 6:30.
                     15 frequency (east/west) 6:30 to 9:00.
                     30 frequency (east/west) 9:00 to 12:00.

         BUS: #75    http://www.tri-met.org/schedule/r075.htm
39th
                     ?? frequency (north/south) <5 blocks east>

If you cross the Morrison Bridge Eastbound, you land on
         Belmont, continue straight about 30 blocks. Parking is
         at a premium for those who drive. The place will be on
         your left just past Zupan's. The 'sign' is a yellow
         banner hanging from the wall above the awning, and pretty
         hard to read at nite.

         Belmont is one block south of Morrison, 5 blocks south of
         Stark, 10 blocks south of Burnside; and 6 blocks north of
         Hawthorne.

Take a look at http://lsm.immunix.org if you aren't familiar with the
project.  I'm preparing for a couple presentations in Ottawa next week,
so your input will certainly help ;-)

See you tomorrow,

Thanks to all of you who so politely pointed out that the date was in the
subject line :-)  I was a victim of being old and set in my ways :-) I've
been reading email with full headers turned on for something like 14
years, and it didn't use to be a problem because the headers were very
short and simple.  These days, the headers are so long that I generally
can't find the subject line even if I do look for it, so I just start
reading the message.  To prevent this from happening again in the future,
I finally took the time to figure out how to turn the full header display
off, so now I will have to find some new way to embarrass myself :-)

According to those who have been able to get it already, Slackware RC3 as of
6-16-02 is 8.1, release.  :-)

ftp.eunet.be has ISOs dated the 15th, but if you check the changelogs, there
were mainly just some RAID issues worked out there.

ftp.slackware.at/data has been reported to be a very fast mirror... one guy
is reporting 300KB/sec off it.

Slackware, for those who don't know... it the 'oldest commercial linux
distro' ... if you're used to RedHat or Mandrake, it is a bit different.
More of a do-it-yourself-so-you-know-it-is-right kinda distro.  The main
selling point for me was the lack of RPMs (although you can install some
RPMs... not recommended) and the BSD-style init.

I've been running 8.1 Beta 2 on an old laptop since it was released.  It's
been working wonderfully, I only found a few small problems which Pat worked
out before I was even able to report them to him.

Thanks to Dhruva and Ali for pointing out that 'ls' gets its
colorization info from the environment variable "LS_COLORS". The
'dircolors' utility handily creates a revised LS_COLORS if fed a custom
config file.

I opted to modify my LS_COLORS variable via /etc/profile. I didn't bother
to dig around and see if 'dircolors' itself is called upon by some rc
script at system startup.

One thing I did learn (the long, frustrating way), is that starting a
new xterm does *not* count as an entirely new login (which seems to be
necessary in order for any changes made to your BASH config files to
take effect). Argh. :-P

Your .bash_profile is read once, when you first login.  Your .bashrc,
however, is run with each new terminal you startup.  If you want to load
changes you've made to .bash_profile without logging out, just type this:

. .bash_profile

I seem to recall the ' -ls ' arg for xterm will force a read of .profile 
for that new instance of xterm.

I had 2 of the same type of hard drives doing this. When my main hard
drive was doing this I freaked and ended up buying a new hard drive...
but the problem seemed to still sit on the 2nd hard drive. 

I just replaced my motherboard/cpu/ram this weekend... and noticed that
it is still having issues with the mounted hard drive.
I'm in the process of trying to copy over the important files (basically
5000 mp3s) from the hard drive to my new one...and perhaps I'll format
it.

What would cause 2 hard drives to do this at the same time?

purposes of security.  But this database, Sybase SQL Anywhere 7, doesn't
seem to have any options for changing the user when run as a daemon. 
Apparently Sybase is confident in the security of their products.

Anyway, I started writing an init script to use the su command with the
"-c" option--the only way I can find to do this.  But su can be tricky,
and I quickly found it impracticable to stuff everything into the string
following "-c".  For one thing, su tweaks the path, so I would have to
wedge "export PATH=$PATH;" in there to get around that.  And then there
is the command(s) itself, which may contain quotes, so I have embedded
quotes to wrestle with.  Oh, and if I want the $USER variable to be
right, I need to add the "-" option, which fubars the rest of my
environment.

Thus, my solution was to create a script that takes the standard init
commands (start|stop|restart, etc.) and call that from my runlevel
script, in this general form:

	su - $RUN_USER -c "$RUN_SCRIPT start"

This allowed all of the environment logic to go in the other script, yet
it still seems redundant to have to create a separate script in order
just to su to a daemon user at boot time.  So I'm just wondering if
anyone has a more elegant solution on hand.


Also and by the way, what's an easy way to find files matching a given
date or time?  The best I can do is something like this:

	find /starting/path -printf "%p - %c\n" | grep "Jun 12 20:53"

Thanks once more,

On my system it seems .bash_profile is read with each terminal window I
open, but maybe that constitutes a login.  .bashrc, on the other hand,
is reread for each shell I start, even within an existing terminal.  One
interesting thing to note is, .bashrc is NOT read automatically when I
first open a terminal, though it is read for child shells.  I have to
explicitly read it in .bash_profile to get my aliases in a new terminal.
 Thought that was kinda strange.

Check out:

I provide the orbital.us mirror myself.

A word of caution however, the slackware.at mirror was reporting bad 
checksums on the iso, not sure if it is still an issue.
My mirror was synced up (via rsync) with the main site.

Not sure what speeds you'll get from it... currently pushing around 6mbit/s

Writing wrapper scripts has long been part of Unix administration.  
Lots of third-party apps get invoked that way simply because, as you
discovered, managing all those environment variables is very 
difficult.

If you don't want to do the full init script thing, you might look at 
sudo to see if it meets your needs, but it's likely you'll end up with 
a wrapper regardless :-(

Thanks John, that's great!  :-)

I just downloaded and installed Jurgen's (ftp.eunet.be) 6-15 -current ISO.  I 
literally finished installing it at the same time Pat made his announcement.

The only changes, luckily, weren't thinks that had any effect on me, IIRC.

Or perhaps (and this is a little further out there, but hey, you've gotta 
consider everything =P), the ATA controller on the motherboard you replaced 
was going bad, wrote data to the drives in an, ah, *interesting* (read: wrong 
=P) fashion, and now the new motherboard is having problems with the drives 
because it can't figure out how the data was written to the drive?  *shrug*

Hi All,

I would like to be able to use a cron type job to verify the
availability of a list of video content, sort of like a ping test for a
list of url's.

I've searched the web, and looked long and hard at the lynx man page,
but I'm not sure where to begin.  I guess that I just need a tool that
will give a "yes" or "no" depending on whether or not it could find the
file on a streaming server.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

wget.

wget -S --spider -i url.list

This'll go through the list of URLs in the file url.list and return the
HTTP responses for each URL in turn.

You've gotta parse those responses, though.

Oh, a streaming server?  Is it just http?  If it's any of that
mms: garbage, wget won't do it.

Well, ultimately there is mms: garbage at the other end, but I may be
able to get away with just checking the connection to the http://*.asx
file.

I didn't know wget had those capabilities, thanks for the info.

Hi All,

I've got another problem that I need ideas for.  I would like to be able
to have a php script (or program -- I'm not sure what to call it) run as
a cron job.  From what I can tell, the interpreter has to be run through
the web server, which means that I need to be able to call a .php file
from a command line browser, then have it die when the php script has
finished doing the voodoo that it needs to do.  Calling the .php file is
not a big problem, lynx does it well enough from a shell script, but
convincing it to die at the appropriate time is more problematic.

I'm sure this is possible, this is linux after all. I think what I need
is to be able to grab the PID, stuff it in a variable, then kill that
process.  I can't figure out how to grab the PID though.

Are there other ways to get this job done?

TIA

Sure, install the cgi version of php, that makes an executable php that you
can use in a script with #!/bin/php just like a regular shell script.

There also is a php shell... look around for it.

This package conflicts with php4-sablot, which I really shouldn't get
rid of.  That would have done the job though.

I can't seem to find one, do you happen to know what it is called?

Why can't they be run on the command line?

Try:

php <script name>

and they should run.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0206191822060.10369-100000@lukem.com>

I'm trying to configure a box so people can scp files to it, but can't
actually ssh in.  I created a script named scpsh with this in it:

#!/bin/sh
#
exec /usr/bin/scp -t $HOME


Then I added scpsh to /etc/shells and made it their shell in /etc/passwd.
So now users can use scp to copy files over just fine, but when they try
to ssh, it sits there until they hit a key, at which point they get:

scp: protocol error: unexpected <newline>
Connection to 1.2.3.4 closed.


Is this the best way to handle this?  Is there a better way that anyone
knows of?
Thanks,

Since we're sharing... :)



I'm part of a 2+ man group that has always seemed to be missing a piece or
two for years. :)


I've got a full Pearl drum kit with both Zilgiawhozitspelled and Sabian
cymbals, Gibraltar hardware and DB pedal, etc, etc.  It's untuned and needs
a drummer to set it up.  Even better, to stay and play it for a while.  (I'm
no drummer.)  In the meantime, I sometimes use various midi tools, Trommler,
and VSPace related tools for percussion.  I lay down a guitar track
sometimes, but I'm not great at that, either.  My guit dude does the real
stuff.

I need a new bass amp setup... got a Peavy megabass and a 18+2x10 cabinet.
Plenty of power and sounds OK, but I'd prefer a little better quality.

I've got 4 basses of various types and string counts at the moment.  I
think.  I'd have to check to remember what I've sold/traded and what I was
just thinking about doing that with.  Of course there are various
knick-knacks that go with them.

I have an 8 channel Allen & Heath mixer that is very nice, but not really
what I need (more than 2 busses) that I'd like to pass on.  I also have a 16
channel (I think?) Soundcraft that I usually use.  (Has 4 busses.)

My recording equipment is crap.  But does a fair job considering what it is.
:)  A tascam 414. :P

I'd put this in a link instead, but I haven't maintained a web page for some
time.  Need to get back to it.


> gear info at:
> http://www.subtend.net/music.html
> 


I'm on both BeSonic and IUMA... look for SourTrout.  I don't remember which
has more, or which has what.

Warning... a lot of the recordings were only semi complete as far as
composing parts goes, years old, and of a "hanging out in a garage loft with
beer" level of seriousness as far as keeping things tight goes. :)  With the
most unbelieveably hokey recording setup you could imagine.  (Back before
the mixers.  Think radio shack mikes and Y-cables!)  We've been slacking for
way too long and need to redo them better, and get the new stuff organized.
Right after we find a drummer. ?

Warning 2... my guit dude refers to some of it as "clown rock", so take that
how you will. :)

Could a "user" include someone like apache, squid, named, and so on? 
I checked all the regular users (root + every one with a login)
and their $MAIL variables are all set to /var/spool/mail/$USER

(this machine only has four users, including root)

We get these at work a lot between Linux and Solaris.  Means the NFS client
cannot get a connection to the Sun NFS server.  The server is busy doing

Take a look at functions in the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory (RedHat).  There

Subject: [PLUG] up2date && apache
Message-ID: <20020620051840.A15319@kippered.herring.org>

A heads-up on the RH up2date on Apache. I loaded the update last night. No
.rpmnew files were created, and `rpm -q apache' showed the apache had been
upgraded to apache-1.3.22-6, so I went to bed thinking all was well. This
morning, I wasn't able to connect to www.herring.org, and discovered httpd
was dead (although the PID was valid). I restarted httpd and it came up
fine. Here's what I found in /etc/httpd/error_log:

[Thu Jun 20 00:01:22 2002] [warn] child process 10952 did not exit, sending another SIGHUP
[Thu Jun 20 00:01:22 2002] [notice] SIGHUP received.  Attempting to restart
Syntax error on line 36 of /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /etc/httpd/modules/mod_log_config.so into server: /etc/httpd/modules/mod_log_config.so: undefined symbol: ap_escape_logitem
[Thu Jun 20 04:38:59 2002] [notice] Apache/1.3.22 (Unix)  (Red-Hat/Linux) mod_ssl/2.8.5 OpenSSL/0.9.6b DAV/1.0.2 PHP/4.0.6 mod_perl/1.26 configured -- resuming
normal operations

The last line was written after the `service httpd restart' I did when I got
up this morning. After the restart, the config file is fine...

[root at kippered conf]# service httpd configtest
Syntax OK

I'd suggest restarting httpd after doing an up2date for the apache bug fix
before cron.daily triggers syslogd.

I've run into similar problems with some services.  Typically I shut the 
service down, do the update, then start the service.  Some RPMs just don't 
handle this well but it could be an issue with updating a running service 
instead of a RPM construction.
   Best case(?) was I had named crash (stopped responding) on me after an 
update.

If you are using gdm, I think there are some automatic login settings.  you

He heard there oft the flying sound
Of feet as light as linden-leaves,
Of music welling underground,
In hidden hollows quavering.
Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves,
And one by one with sighing sound
Whispering fell the beechen leaves
In the wintry woodland wavering.

He sought her ever, wandering far
Where leaves of years were thickly strewn,
By light of moon and ray of star
In frosty heavens shivering.
Her mantle glinted in the moon,
As on a hill-top high and far
She danced, and at her feet was strewn
A mist of silver quivering.

When winter passed, she came again,
And her song released the sudden spring,
Like rising lark, and falling rain,
And melting water bubbling.
He saw the elven-flowers spring
About her feet, and healed again
He longed by her to dance and sing
Upon the grass untroubling.

Yes, that is what is wrong.  If you installed from a recent CD image, 
the installer may have been set up so that it wrote lines for "stable" 
into the "/etc/apt/sources.list" file, since that will be correct upon 
release.  But, Woody has not been released yet, and thus is symlinked as 
"testing" rather than "stable" still.  It's just one of those 
transitional things.

Here's what I would do...  Copy in the attached "/etc/apt/sources.list" 
AND "/etc/apt/preferences" (taken from drizzle.pdxlinux.org), then run 
"# apt-get update".  That will add both "testing" and "unstable" to your 
sources list, and the "man apt_preferences" will tell it that "testing" 
is default, but allow install of "unstable" versions iff you specify 
"--target-release unstable" on the "apt-get" command line.  This also 
works from inside "aptitude" -- it will auto select only the default 
release, but you may hand select from the other release(s) if you like. 
  Note that this can theoreticly give you a downgrade path; I've never 
tested that myself.

At the package archive server, "stable" is currently a symlink to 
"potato", "testing" is currently a symlink to "woody", and "unstable" is 
currently a symlink to "sid".  That will change after the release -- 
"stable" will be a symlink to "woody", etc.  So, if you want "woody" and 
  "sid", not "testing" and "unstable", then be sure to edit that 
"sources.list", s/testing/woody/g and s/unstable/sid/g.  The 
"preferences" is already set up for either "woody" or "testing" to be at 
default priority.

Have you ever used "aptitude"?  If not, I strongly suggest "# apt-get 
install aptitude", and try it out.  It's a LOT BETTER than "dselect". 
No other package management user interface can match it!

RTFM, Folks.  If you are not sure what manuals there are, try "dpkg 
--list <PKG> | grep '/man/'" to see a list of them.  Also check the 
"/usr/share/doc/PKGNAME" directory, plus run "aptitude search 
PKGBASENAME" to see if there are additional "-doc" packages available.

Also see "# apt-get" with no arguments for a breif help message.

Don't -- "dpkg" is what actually manages that data; the other tools read 
from it.

I think all you need to do is adjust your "/etc/apt/sources.list", 
perhaps "/etc/apt/preferences" (man apt_preferences), run "apt-get 
update", and it will have done what you want here.

My recommendation is to quit using "dselect" (unless you really do 
prefer it...) and use "aptitude" instead.  Try it!  You'll like it.

What concept do I need to read up on to understand how to set up a Linux
machine so that it will run a kiosk application? The problem I'm trying
to figure out is how to have the machine automatically log in as a
limited ability user after a power up and start the kiosk application
when no one is around.

After you edit "/etc/apt/sources.list", you must run "apt-get update" to 
cause Apt to download the "Packages.gz" and "Sources.gz" files from the 
archive server.  After it downloads them, it automaticly rebuilds it's 
binary cache from that ascii rfc822 format package meta data.

You don't have to purge anything -- just fix up "sources.list" and run 
"apt-get update", THEN install packages.  If you are using "testing" or 
"unstable", you must run "apt-get update" quite often, since Debian is a 
very dynamic moving target.

Ok, there's one, and Mike's vote for sure counts.  So, what we need to 
do is figure out how to make the news interface "closed" -- open to 
subscribers only.  I think it's supposed to support authenticated 
access, so we should look into that.  Anyone want to spend some time on 
this task?  I'm WAY too busy right now.

That would be cool, but no. This would be for an unattended museum

Thanks for the link, but this doesn't look like it is what we need.  It
looks like this is used to create a CLI using php and your web server,
giving you the ability to run commands from your browser.  A great idea
in its own right, but seems like a security risk on a public server.

It looks like I need to convince the powers that be to upgrade php to
version 4.3 or better.

Back on 6/12 I posted...


It is possible to use nnrpaccess to authenticate...

# Set these variables if you need to authenticate to your NNTP server for
# Usenet posting or reading.  If no authentication is necessary, specify None
# for both variables.
NNTP_USERNAME = None
NNTP_PASSWORD = None

...by including the appropriate info in ~mailman/Mailman/mm_cfg.py.


You could then dole that information out to those who want access via NNTP
(like Randal S.).

However, as I've previously noted, the SPAM we've seen so far hasn't been
inserted via NNTP, it's been SMTP. The list needs to be subscriber only to
prevent that. I also pointed out that it's also possible to require list
membership in general, but waive the requirement on a per user basis in the
General Posting Filters section...

Addresses of members accepted for       This settings can be used to designate
posting to this list without implicit   posting privileges to persons who are
approval requirement.                   not subscribers to the list. It may
                                        also be used to specify persons who
                                        are exclusively allowed to post.
                                        Please see the chart below for
                                        explanation.

Ok. That's getting closer. I ran locate on rc.local and got:

  /etc/rc.d/rc.local
  /etc/rc.local 
  /usr/share/man/ja/man5/rc.local.5.gz

I looked at the rc.local files and can probably figure out what's going
on there if I spend some time with it (will do that later).

Does the /usr/share/man/ja/man5/rc.local.5.gz mean that there is a man
page? I tried man rc, man rc.local, and man ja but find that there is
"No manual entry for rc," or any of the others. There is a man entry for
local, but it only has a list of builtin commands, including local.
Running less on /usr/share/man/ja/man5/rc.local.5.gz results in:

soelim:<standard input>:1: can't open `man5/rc.boot.5': No such file or
directory

Well my understanding with rc.local is it works similar to how autoexec.bat
did in the old DOS days.  Anything that is put on a line in that file will
get executed after all the other services have been started on the system.

I use the one under /etc/rc.d/rc.local to make additions to.  This is on a
RedHat 6.2 system with a 2.2.x kernel.  I don't know if other distros are
different, Debian doesn't seem to have that structure.

Ok. That's getting closer. I ran locate on rc.local and got:

  /etc/rc.d/rc.local

Hello,

I'm curious as to what other local technical (unixey or otherwise) groups
people are a member of. I know about all the plug-* lists but what
are some others that people enjoy?

Well, I'm a member of the Boulder (Colorado) Linux Users Group.  Of
course this is not local--but then, neither am I (Denver).

If anyone is curious, I heard about this group during the M$ shakedown
of your local school districts.  I joined to see what you folks did
about it, and haven't been able to tear myself away since.

I also subscribe to the Specialized Systems Consultant (SSC) 
"linux-list". I've seen some people call it the Seattle Linux List but 
you don't have to be in the Seattle area to subscribe to the list and I 
see posts from people in other countries on the list as well. If you 
don't know what company SSC is, it's the one that publishes the "Linux 
Journal" magazine. The list of mailing lists they run can be found 
through this URL:

The website design was going into preliminary discussion about 6-8 
months ago, and has been worked on by a number of individuals since.  A 
slash/postnuke news gateway was brought up at one point, but dismissed 
as too much for what we needed.

webpage development, join the plug-web list.

Ben's explanation is correct. Check the comments in rc.local...

#!/bin/sh
#
# This script will be executed *after* all the other init scripts.
# You can put your own initialization stuff in here if you don't
# want to do the full Sys V style init stuff.


There's no `man' or `info' page - but it really doesn't need one. Also, note
that...

[bigfish at kippered bigfish]$ ls -l /etc/rc.d/rc.local /etc/rc.local
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          220 Jul 10  2001 /etc/rc.d/rc.local
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           13 Feb 20 19:57 /etc/rc.local -> rc.d/rc.local

.../etc/rc.local is a symlink to /etc/rc.d/rc.local.

p.s.    I don't have /usr/share/man/ja/man5/rc.local.5.gz on my system

It is just slashcode.  Anybody can do it.

I like Postnuke myself though.  More features a easier to admin.

Postnuke.com  Takes 5 minutes to install it.

So, plug.org is in Provo, UT. hrmmm... plug.net is for sale. I wonder how
much DomainCollection.com wants.

plug.us is registered by Global DNS Services in the Netherlands - that
hardly seems fair *harrumph*

I've had pretty good luck so far with "EVMS".  You would need a fresh 
hard drive to start with, and lots of know how to get it installed, 
since the current installers do not support it.  What I did was make a 
500 Mb "/" partition, a 1Gb swap, and the rest of the drive a Linux LVM 
type partition, to use for EVMS.  I installed a minimal Debian "woody" 
system in "/", then hand built a patched kernel (by using the Debian 
"kernel-package" system, "kernel-source-2.4.18" and "kernel-patch-evms") 
on another box to install there, then used "apt-get" to install the EVMS 
toolset on it.  I then logged into it from my X terminal via "ssh -X", 
and ran the "evmsgui" program.  I used that to make logical volumes in 
the big partition, made filesystems on them (XFS), mounted them (on 
"/mnt/tmp"), copied stuff on (tar -C /usr/ -cf - | tar -C /mnt/tmp -x) 
then moved aside the old "/usr", created a new mount point there, then 
mounted the new copy there.  Don't forget to adjust the "/etc/fstab" 
before a reboot!

The Handspring Treo is one such beast. It worked pretty well for my 
former CEO, once he got issues surrounding wireless ISP support ironed 
out. The interface was semi-tricky to navigate, but altogether the 
Treo is pretty neat.

I believe Wil Cooley and AJ Lavin have fixed this after a few tests.  I 
could be wrong - a message posted to the list from a non-subscribed 
address would verify that it wasn't working as I thought.

There are a number of options available, some of which are now getting
viable.
The Handspring Treo 270 is the one I have my eye on.

This is a test to see if the PLUG list is now a subsrciber only list
again.

Ok, does the news gateway still work?  It would be alright to set up 
authenticated access to the nntp server, and to keep the subscriber 
lists in sync somehow.  If that requires hacking "mailman", then we 
should first off "apt-get source" a copy and check it into CVS to work 
with.  I wonder how well the "cvs-buildpackage" scripts work nowadays? 
We can install them on drizzle and try them out.  The general idea is to 
start with known installable and working sources, fix them in a 
diff-able and maintainable way, use "debian/rules binary" to create an 
installable package, and install that.  Then, use "aptitude hold 
mailman" to put it on hold, to prevent an auto-upgrade that would 
replace our modified version.

Ideally, our patch can be sent off to the Mailman maintainers.

I know they fixed it for the plug-mmtest list, and I believe that they 
sent Karl an email outlining the procedure.  I'll get with them and make 
sure.

This is what I did with the "uw-imapd-ssl" that is installed on 
"drizzle".  I did not, at the time, know how to get "/etc/c-client.cf" 
to work ("I accept the responsibility"), so I patched the sources to 
make the default user mailbox directory be "~/Mail" rather than "~", 
which I found annoying, especially on a box that I also log into and 
actually use my home directory there for things other than email mbox files.

I had this exact same problem when I tried to install but it was on disk2.
 The problem was solved when I reburned the CD.  I chalked it up to a poor
CD.  I had downloaded the ISO's and burned them.  I like you was able to
read on a windows box the CD but the install didnt' work so I just
reburned the CD2 and it installed fine.

Ok, somebody please correct me if I am wrong, but the way that I understand how the man pages are laid out is that they are under /usr/share/man/<locale>/man<page number>/

so the location there is the Japanese (?) man pages since they are under /usr/share/man/ja/

your English man pages (or at least US) would be under /usr/share/man/us or maybe just /usr/share/man<page>

hope that is right :)

Or the textbook reading.  I carry a book everywhere I go, often reading 
while I walk.  Public transit is great for that -- hands free to turn 
pages and somebody else does the driving.

If I read one book a month I'm doing better than most people.  If I read 
two, even better.

Abraham (and whoever else),

There are a number of products that have tried to do just such a thing. By
and large these products fail primarily because you either get a gizzy that
is a bit bigger than a comfy cell phone, and a bit smaller than a comfy PDA.
It's one of the first gen of crossbreeding devices, and opinions on it are
varied. For the most part people are content to carry two devices to get the
full functionality out of each of them. Even now, items such as the Treo and
a few other PhoneDAs are making some sort of sacrifice, and the trick is to
find something that makes the sacrifice that you're willing to make.

To actually get started on shopping, you want to consider plans. Without
getting into a dreadful amount of detail, not all phones work on all
networks, so you need to think about what sort of cellular plan you need,
and how important coverage/pricing/airtime is vs. the device you really
want. Also, you said it was a department meeting...how many people are in
your department? That might be leverage for a corporate rate plan or some
sort of discount on the units themselves. (I worked in a company where the
rate plan was offered to every employee to help get the better deal, but
only certain people had their bill paid by the company. It was such a good
rate plan there was no upgrade until about two weeks ago. I had the same
plan for over 3 years!)

Treo is good, I have a lot of faith in Handspring and I think they might
have figured it out. From what little I've played with a Treo, it seems that
they get it and seemed to do it right. You may be able to find the Kyocera
palm phone on a discount, it was a first generation device. Samsung, I
believe, (but can't confirm since the mobile section of the site doesn't
work for me) makes a phone that has the same PhoneDA functionality. Verizon
is now selling a Thera from Audiovox, which appears to be a pocketpc phone.
Nokia just came out with one that looks pretty slick:
http://www.nokiausa.com/communicator/features/1,4983,,00.html
And there's a PocketPC Phone Edition on the Voicestream site now:
http://www.voicestream.com/pocketpc/default.asp

You also need to consider what you want from the combo: some Nokia phones
(and others, I'm guessing) offer scheduling and address books. Do you want
more? I ask because of pricing. To get the combo, you're pretty much going
to be paying the price of two devices.

Well! I hope I haven't overwhelmed anyone with all this info or bored
anybody. I hope this answers your question, Abraham. It felt kinda good to
flex my brain, and even better to answer a question on PLUG! So many of them
fly waaaaaaay over my head.

Hope this helps,
-Kelly

My experience (FWIW) is that a little care is required here. Although
rc.local executes last, "last" means that all the commands in the
previous scripts have been *initiated*.  Whether they have been
*completed* or not, is dependent on the specific command. For example,
when rc.local starts executing, there may be daemons in the process
of initializing themselves, but not completely up and running yet.

Just something to thing about.

A lot of people have had problems with homegrown RH 7.3 cds. I had a stubborn 
Disk2, and what's really irritating is there is no option to try another 
disk- the whole installation has to start over. I've always used CDRWs, 
because I test a lot of distros & don't care to have bales of CDRs cluttering 
up the joint. I made RH 7.3 finally install by burning Disk2 to a TDK CDR. I 
don't know if it's some funkiness with the ISO, maybe RH is using finicky 
bits, or if CDRWs are getting crappier.

It's actually already installed on "drizzle" (aka "lists") but not set
up and configured to protect the lists yet.

Mike,

It's extremely unlikely that apache, squid, et al. would be sending email.
Here are some things to investigate...


Do any of your users have a .forward file?

        If so, what are the permissions on the user's home directory?

        I'll wager this is where your problem is. See...
        http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/procmail/qs/#setPermissions

Failing that...

You don't have a user with /var/spool/mail for a home directory, do you?!

Have you checked to make sure that $USER is getting set correctly for each
of the 4 users on your system?

What are the permissions on /var, /var/spool and /var/spool/mail?

What MTA are you using?

    If it's sendmail, what is ForwardPath set to in sendmail.cf?


Hope that helps,
Sandy

Actually, there's a "check disk" option in the RH 7.3 setup. When the first screen comes up, you can choose that, and then it will do MD5s on each disk prior to installation. That way you can be sure of having good media.

I thought I made it clear that this had already been done multiple times.

Sorry if that wasn't properly expressed.

I find that if I use apt-get install <packagename>, I get the latest
versin of the package, but dselect lists "stable" versions of all the
packages that aren't installed.

It's very odd.

I've seen the idea tossed around, but I haven't seen a rebuttal yet:

What is preventing the news gateway from properly working when the list is
set to subscriber-only?

Doesn't the news gateway read the From: header of news posts and check
them against the subscriber list?

Then, if someone wants to use the news gateway primarily, they can simply
check the "no mail" option within mailman.

Someone please post to the list (or me personally, I suppose, but I'll
likely just restate it to the list) why this wouldn't work.

Thanks.

I still think the group could go through one last name change:

Portland Unix-GNU/Linux Users Group

This gets us more in line with proper nomenclature (for PR purposes, of
course WE all know what the GNU system is and why it is an inherent part
of this organization, but the rest of the world could use the
clarification and edification) and meets all the requirements to get
Stallman to talk to the group specifically.  (I'm semi-involved in a
project that might include Stallman coming to speak in town anyway, but he
wouldn't be coming to PLUG.)

And we get the cooler and more likely unique acronym PUGLUG.

And puglug.org is ours (well, mine until the group wants it).

You should look at the init and login processes.

Init doesn't have to call login at all.  You could do something else
entirely.

Or, if you want an X app, you could use gdm or xdm from an init script and
auto-login as a particular user with a .xsession that runs your kiosk
application as the root window and disables X-specific key bindings.

Message-ID: <3D12A26B.916DB567@yahoo.com>

Hey guys

There's an exploit for apache that could get ugly
here fairly soon... it was announced earlier this
week and now somebody's saying that they've had a
kit for it for several months.

http://online.securityfocus.com/news/493

The bottom line is: if you're running a version of
apache lower than 1.3.24 or 2.0.36, you might have
a problem.  If you're running apache on windows,
then you've got something to worry about.

Here's the deal from the apache people:

You have to run "update" from within deselect as well as from apt-get if
you are using both of them.  I don't know why this is, but it has bit me
on more than one occasion.

Right.  I knew that.  Glad to help.

But, again, also look at XSession scripts related to X display managers.

They could probably hold a more direct key without mucking about in the
lower level init and login stuff.

(However, you'll find that changing the behavior of init is just a matter
of modifying your /etc/inittab.  It's even kind of straightforward.)

Now THAT is interesting.

I'll give that a try when I get into the office later.  It's on a private
network behind a HAT box through which there is no way to initiate
connections from outside.

You might try dselect update  and see if that changes the versions that
dselect show.

Well, I have done the md5 and it checked out fine on the third cd.
In fact, I burned yet another copy of the cd and it still failed.
It is really frustrating and as Carla stated you have to restart
the install.  In fact, last night it died with just one package left
to install when prompting for the third cd.  I am using the TDK cdrs.

Actually, there's a "check disk" option in the RH 7.3 setup. When the first
screen comes up, you can choose that, and then it will do MD5s on each disk
prior to installation. That way you can be sure of having good media.

Like I mentioned earlier, Wil and AJ figured this out on the plug-mmtest 
list (try it out, subscribe to mmtest, then post a message to it from a 
non-subscribed address, or use the news gateway).  I *believe* that they 
were going to 'fix' the main list in the same manner.  However, most of 
this was coordinated via the irc channel, and they've both been 
conspicuously absent there just recently.

I'm looking into the options they've set right now.

There's a configuration option that needs to be set.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux Networking course update
Message-ID: <Pine.BSO.4.33.0206210907090.9544-100000@shell.pacifier.com>

I talked to Ed, of ALC, and he tells me 5 people have now signed up for
Linux Networking. That means that the course is definately going to go forward
(enough people signed up). Excellent!

If anyone else is interested here is the info:

------

Okay, Ed Sawicki and the Accelerated Learning Center (ALC) have now
scheduled the Linux Networking Course. So far,  Carla Schroder and I have
committed to taking the course (and several others have expressed
interest). We need a total of six people to sign up for it to be viable
for ALC to run the course. I really hope that at least four more people
sign up for the course!

Dates: Three Thursdays in July - 11th, 18th, and 25th.

Time: 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM

Place: Novell's Portland office. You can find directions and a map here:
http://www.panug.org/meetings/index.htm#direct

Course Outline:
http://www.alcpress.com/training/courses/linuxnetworking.htm

Text: ALC gives a textbook to each student.

Cost: $325

How to register: Call ALC's office at 503-635-6370

I consider this course an experiment of sorts. ALC runs these courses all
over the country (charging $595) but was reluctant to run the course in
Portland because of concerns about enrollment. I had to lobby a bit to
persuade them to run the course in Portland.

If this course is a success in terms of enrollment, then it is much more
likely that ALC will regularly run Linux Networking here in Portland. In
addition, it is more likely that ALC will run Apache Bootcamp, DNS
bootcamp, Linux System Administration, etc. Since Portland is home to ALC
we will likely get fairly substantial discounts on the cost of each
course.

I've never taken a course from Ed but I have heard from several people
that he is an excellent instructor. I look forward to this course. It will
be a lot of fun.

With cell phones, the excuse of the day is, "There was no signal..." Meaning you tried to call, but the signal strength wasn't strong enough where you were. This happens to me (HONEST!) in downtown Portland occasionally. Usually in the center of concrete buildings...

Your problem might be the CDROM drive on the computer, many drives,
particularly those which are 4+ years old have have problems reading
recordable media.

cdr's that Ben brought over the other day...  Oh, wait it did.  ;)

Of course, I'm sure it's more dependant on the drive maker and the 
quality standards they use in mfg than it is the CDR's.

That's a good notion- thing is, I've burned and installed dozens of Linuxes 
from ISO- Red hat, Mandrake, Debian, Slackware- and only RH 7.3 has had this 
particular trouble.  My CDROM drives are all less than two years old. I have 
an old HP CDRW and a new Liteon 24x10x40 which I adore, hasn't made a coaster 
yet. 

Quite a few users are reporting this same trouble, it seems to be specific to 
RH 7.3.

Don't really want to be redundant, but I too think that it is a burning problem.  I haven't installed RedHat, but I had this problem with Mandrake.  When I burned the CDs at 8x some of them worked fine and others didn't.  However, when I burned the images at 1x (only takes about 75 minutes :) all of my CDs seemed to work fine.  Now I only burn ISOs at 1 speed (unless I am in a hurry and don't care about coasters).  So take it for what it is worth, but I would try again burning them at 1x (unless, of course, you burned them at 1x in the first place).

It's important to remember that the specs for CDR and CDRW are not the
same as for standard CDs, so older CDROM drives that were not spec'd for
reading CDR/CDRW while they may work, are working at or beyond their
specifications.  It also makes a difference what hardware was used for
writing the disks, all three of my old CDROM drives have trouble reading
anything written on first or second generation HP CD writers, though two
of them generally work if the disk was written using some other hardware,
but even then they are often rather slow with lots of retrys.  Only one of
these was a somewhat cheap drive, but they are all old (four to seven
years).

can upload (checking for php,php3, phtml, pl...etc) i want them to be able
to upload anything..but i dont want those files to be ran on that folder.

so if someone went to /files/runscript.php  it would run... right now.. is
there a directive that will tell apache to not run a file like it would
normally? perhaps it would just display it as the file code, correct?
I'm sure that there is some simple directive that I just need to add to my
httpd.conf file, correct?

If you want everything to be treated as a text file, you can tell 
Apache that:

  <Location /files>
    ForceType text/plain
  </Location>

Or, if you only need to stop CGI and PHP execution, you could be a bit 
more selective:

  <Location /files>
    AddType  text/plain .php
    Options  -ExecCGI -Includes
  </Location>

Hi-

I'm trying to set up a firewall.  I've just been following the IPMasq Howto for the most part, and do have a basic firewall set up.  However, I want something a little bit more secure.  Folks inside my LAN will be able to open VNC sessions and have SSH access (including X11 forwarding) to the server... I don't want them to be able to (for instance) open up a SOCKS proxy on a high port which folks could tunnel through to get inside the LAN.

I don't want to mess with connections originating from inside the LAN... but I don't want anybody to be able to set up a LISTENING service which people could access from the Internet... unless I, root, say they can.

Any suggestions as to an iptables-based firewall configuration program or script or something?  :-)

I'm running Slackware 8.1... and usually do these kinds of things by hand... but I'm just having a heck of a time understanding the different commands and rules you use to get a firewall going.

You may have a shorter learning curve with TCP Wrappers than with iptables
or ipchains. Just edit /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny and restart
xinetd. See `man 5 hosts_access' and `man host_options'. You can easily
allow outbound traffic and limit inbound connections.

What I just recently did, I bought the new OpenBSD 3.1 release originaly as a secondary DNS box.
But later on, I setup packet forwarding and packet filtering.
Its working just awesome, far better then any other firewall Ive used. The rules are a little different then IPTables, but pretty easy to pick up.
The main openbsd networking FAQ is here: http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq6.html#PF
And I also found this usefull: http://real.ath.cx/BSDinstall.html

Only drawback, theres no public CD images of OpenBSD 3.1, but you can find 3.0 on planetmirror.com

I'm using Putty to connect to a Redhat 7.2 box.  Whenever I try to use vi, I
appear to be put into vi emulation mode.  In other words, I lose all of the
nifty features that put the "IMproved" in vim.

Here's what I know (given that I am a newbie to both vim and Linux):

1.  I'm using the bash shell

2.  When I type "vi", I get the screen stating that it is
    "VIM - Vi IMproved".

3.  I try setting ":syntax on" and I get a message saying
    "Sorry, this command is not implemented".

4.  All I have in my .vimrc (for now):

    set ts=4
    set autoindent

What can I do to debug this further?

Thanks Sandy  :-)

I'm actually using inetd... but I have set up some very basic fules with
hosts.allow and hosts.deny.  I could be missing something totally here...
but I don't think tcpwrappers will keep users logged on via VNC on the
internal network from opening up servers which are open to the external
network (the Internet)... will they?

The basic iptables rules I set up from the IPMasq FAQ, in addition to my
tcpwrappers setup should keep inetd-started servers well behaved... but my
concern is what those logged on via VNC might accidentally do.  My Linux
networking understanding isn't that great... but I seem to recall users are
able to open up and listen to high port numbers (over 1024, was it?).  I
want to disable that, except specific ports I say are ok... for instance, I
want to allow a friend to open a tightvnc connection after he logs in with
SSH.

Thanks for the input and directions... I'm off to do more reading... getting
Squid-Cache and SquidGuard up and running at the time.  :-)

TCP Wrappers won't prevent anyone from setting up an insecure listening
service, it only applies to programs specifically coded to support it, or
those programs which have been "wrapped" by it through running it within
the wrapper script (usually done from within inetd or one of it's
variants).  Any program without TCP wrappers support, or launched from
outside the wrapper is completely unprotected.

Setting up a firewall to meet the above requirements can be a little
complicated, since you are trying to protect it from both internal
mistakes/abuse and external attacks, generally, the simplest approach is
to not let the users do anything "through" the firewall, and instead setup
a proxy server for them to use and configure your firewall to block
everything but the proxy.  Then as new services are needed, add different
proxies and/or open up the firewall for just the desired service,
preferably with limiting the use of the service to as few internal
computers as is practical.

Unfortunately, since I have always done my firewalls by hand, I don't know
how good any of the firewall programs are.  I have heard some good things
about bastille, but have no first hand knowledge.  One little warning,
from the configuration programs/scripts I have seen in the past, I think
in most cases, you really need to take the time to understand firewalls to
use these scripts safely and effectively, otherwise most of them will
allow you to configure a firewall which is wide open.

Brian,

Thanks, but I already tried that.  Says "command not found".  Our admin
assures me that we don't actually have vi on the box and vi is, in fact,
vim.  Since it identifies itself as vim and all of its documentation is for
vim, I assume that this is, in fact, the case.  Typing "man vi":

  VIM(1)
  ...blah, blah, blah...

Since it's behaving like vi, I assume that this is why it's using
vi-emulation mode.

Cheers,
Curtis

Having set up several router/firewall systems I'd suggest going with
dedicated router/firewall hardware.  Then (hopefully) regardless of the
status of security updates on any of the computers you're pretty darn sure
your network is protected.
   Where I worked before we had a hard time convincing the customers to
spend the money to keep their systems up to date and I saw several get
broken into even through dial up lines.  Of course the bill to recover was 
a touch more than the updating would have been.

Heck I just put an Asante router/firewall on my home network.  I went for
the FriendlyNet FR3004C with a serial port that I'm using right now with a
56K modem until I sort out a broadband solution. 8-( About 600 feet to far 
for DSL.)

Try "vi -N";  This run vim non-compatible mode. Vi 
compatible mode which doesn't do syntax. You may need to 
muck about with your .vimrc

You currently have the vim-minimal package installed which provides
stock vi support. Your admin needs to install the vim-enhanced package
which includes support for stuff like :syntax on.

Which, actually, is the approach I've taken with my home LAN. I've got an
SMC Barricade (SMC7004AWBR). I've also written some TCP Wrappers on my web
server to regulate who gets in (e.g., sshd) for ports I've opened up.

Okay, we have proved to ALC that we can get together enough people to run
a Linux Networking course! I think they will be more more willing to run
something like Apache or DNS bootcamp. I believe they are two days (8:30 -
4:30) long.

How many out there would be interested in taking Apache or DNS bootcamp?
Which of those two would you prefer? How about August?

If several of you express interest (as with the Linux Networking) I will
lobby ALC to run one of those courses this summer.

What if we don't think that's the one? :)

I actually happen to use MacOS / OSX for all my 'standard' computing needs
at home... with FreeBSD, Irix, and Solaris intermingled for all my other
machines. I think I have a Win2K box somewhere, but I never use it. At work,
I have a huge amount of linux servers setup and running (as well as Win2K,
WinXP, FreeBSD and Solaris). Basically, I have a very diverse experience
with different operating systems.

I happen to somewhat agree with David Coursey. For those who are not
computer literate (i.e. most windows only users I have met) getting an Xfree
desktop system working is close to impossible. I don't personally think it's
that great of a challenge, but I'm a system administrator. Most of these
people want to sit down and go. They don't want to know anything except what
button to click to "make it work".

In these situations, based on my experiences with XP, I would have to say
OSX is the best choice of the three for an easy and usable desktop with the
least amount of effort.

Whee!

Kaile

	Heh.

	As far as i'm concerned, Apple did it right with MacOS X.  I voted
for it because i've used it extensively for all sorts of development and
it's _nice_.  A big reason I was able to do different kinds of development
(gtk apps, web stuff, mod_perl, HTML::Mason, etc.) was the ultra-awesome
app from sourceforge called Fink.  After I installed it I tried "fink
install enlightentment"  as sort of a test to see how quickly it would
break.  It installed X and everything that I needed to run elightenment.
On top of that, I could choose to have X apps on the Aqua desktop or set a
hotkey to switch from X to Aqua.  So Lopster, Galeon, Evolution running on
one side.  Hit <cmd>-<opt>-A to switch back to Aqua for Photoshop, Flash,
etc.  IMO, that's about ten different kinds of cool.

If it had been a poll about what I trust more for a server I would have
voted Linux.  For the desktop though MacOS X has won me over.

For some reason when I reboot my server all the network settings do not 
get activated.  I have had this server up for a few months and 
re-booted it by pulling the plug by accedent. I'm running Mandrake 8.1 and 
I have manually set up my routing and set network devices from the command line.

I have waded through a few network init files but can not find where I 
should enter network information.  I've been using the O'Reilly Network 
book as a guide and the examples that they use do not work on my system.

Is Mandrake goofy or am I (the answer may be both)?

I do not have root access to the list server. In any case, changing
the policy of the PLUG lists is the list administrator's
responsibility.

The only change that Wilco made was to the MailMan test list,
"plug-mmtest". He just converted it to a closed list. As previously
documented, this has the effect of:

1. allowing subscribers only to post to plug-mmtest via email. Posts
from non-subscribers are held for moderator approval.

2. forwarding to the plug-mmtest mailing list of plug.mmtest newsgroup
posts that have a From: header equal to a list subscriber's address.

3. dis-allowing posts to the plug-mmtest mailing list From
non-subscribed email addresses.

Anyone can verify this policy by posting to plug-mmtest.

That is one vote for DNS bootcamp. If we can get a few more votes for DNS
then you will be well on your way to ruling the world. What would you do
with such power?

Happy Birthday! I will raise my glass in celebration, just as I raised my

No, they don't.  However, one user (me) has a fairly elaborate
.procmail (primarily for spam control)

Well, yes. The user "mail":

% grep mail /etc/passwd
mail:x:8:12:mail:/var/spool/mail:/sbin/nologin

Also, /var/spool/mail is owned by the group mail and is group
writable (see below) - Is that anything out of the ordinary?

> Have you checked to make sure that $USER is getting set correctly for each

It is

> What are the permissions on /var, /var/spool and /var/spool/mail?

%ls -ld /var /var/spool /var/spool/mail
drwxr-xr-x   26 root     root         4096 Mar 18 18:14 /var

drwxrwxr-x    2 root     mail         4096 Jun 21 19:39 /var/spool/mail

/var/spool/mail itself is writeable by the group mail. Is this
unusual? AFAIK it came that way default in the Red Hat install

% grep mail /etc/group
mail:x:12:mail

Sendmail it is... To be honest, I can't figure out what $z and
$w are. This does appear to match the "example" in the sendmail
documentation. I once had a copy of the whole documentation on
the sendmail config file, but I can't find it at the moment.

# Forward file search path
O ForwardPath=$z/.forward.$w:$z/.forward

I have a different form of functions on my LFS system (pun intended). 
Could you send me your file, or maybe post the relevant code?

I agree that would be an improvement.  He sounds like a lunkhead.

I don't know... I mean, have you USED MacOSX  It's really freakin' nice.

If I had to use commercial software, I'd use MacOSX over anything else
(including Red Hat Linux).

That's also correct. Excerpted from...

    $w The hostname of this site. This is the root name of this host 

    $z The home directory of the recipient.

I'm plum outta ideas on your problem, Mike. Any sendmail gurus wanna take an
at bat on this? You may try turning off your procmail recipes for a day or
two and see if the problem still exists.

Subject: [PLUG] Network failure, different kernels of the same revision.
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0206212143210.619-100000@shaft.bitmine.net>

I have a Dell PowerEdge 4400 dual Xeon 800 with a pile of RAM.

It has an onboard eepro100 and a PCI rtl8139.

I installed with the Debian 3.0 bf2.4 CD.  I built the system running the
kernel from that release.

I realized that this was a single-proc kernel and figured I should
definitely go SMP on this little thing.

So, first I downloaded the kernel-source-2.4.18 package and configured and
built the kernel using make-kpkg.  That seemed to work smoothly.  Then I
did a dpkg -i to install my new kernel.

Odd thing is, when I rebooted the system, the network was unavailable.  I
double-checked that the drivers had picked up the two interfaces and that
the scripts had configured them properly.  Sure thing... there they
were.  I checked the physical connections and the routing table.  All
good.  No different than before.

Yet, I get no connectivity out.

Then I back-reved to the bf2.4 kernel (which wasn't a backrev at all
because it's still a 2.4.18 kernel) and everything worked again.

So then I tried apt-get install kernel-image-2.4.18-686-smp.  The install
went fine and I set up the initrd thingie in lilo and we were all ready to
go.

Rebooted to find I was in the same situation as my custom kernel:  Network
devices are present and configured, the routes are accurate, but I have no
network connectivity.

Again, back to bf2.4 kernel and everything works.

I'm at the end of my rope.  What am I forgetting?

Thanks.

I bought an old Pentium 75 (for $50) and using a floppy based 
firewall. It's done using a distro from the linux router project 
(http://www.linuxrouter.org) or more specifically from
http://lrp.steinkuehler.net/.

It took a while to configure (a couple of days the first time, 
minutes each other time), and I've had to download new images 
every time they change my access (new provider, provider 
upgraded to new dhcp software, etc).  But I've been pretty
happy. I just wished I hadn't thrown my old 486 because it 
could've been used for the same thing.

Subject: [PLUG] rpm question
Message-ID: <20020622045454.6E13E10E055@pons.enet.sharplabs.com>

How do I get a .rpm package to build from a .src.rpm
using a particular "arhitechture".

Currently, every time I build a package it gets put in the
/usr/src/RPM/RPMS/i586 directory.  More annoying is that the %optflags
macro is getting set with (among other things) `-march=i586' and
`-mcpu=pentiumpro'

I would like `-march=athlon-mp' to be set instead.
I've defined a line:

optflags: athlon -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -march=athlon-mp -ffast-math -fno-strength-reduce

in /etc/rpmrc

but I can't get the build to ever see this.

What I am missing?


Dean

P.S. I'm running rpm-4.0.3-10mdk

Well, actually this has only happened twice since I converted over
to Linux (from FreeBSD) in January. (Although I'm not discounting
the possibility that some weird bug in my procmail config could
be the problem)

Sandy, I do appreciate your help on this. I'm going to assume
that it's nothing serious. But if anyone has any idea what it
might be, please speak up!

This is what I've heard from many and the few looks I've had impressed 
me.  On the other hand, I've been doing Unix for 20 years and am quite 
comfortable with tweaking Linux installs (or just side stepping wierd 
bits).  Fairly recently I switched all the systems in my household to 
Linux.  For my wife, it wasn't too bad once I set up the system for her, 
but there were still some rough points.  Mainly areas where I thought it 
was obvious, but my wife needed a bit more direction.
Linux is usable for the desktop, but it's not quite ready for out of the 
box desktop for the average user without some handholding.

Well, I've spent the day dinkin' around with this derned thing.  I must
say... I'm getting a little bit scared.  A few things have actually made
sense!  =O

I'm using the script from the IPMasq Howto document... 'Hard Firewall' ...
I've been able to modify it so I can open ports at will, but cannot close
them without running the whole script again.  To open the ports, I just run:

iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 -p tcp --dport <port> -j ACCEPT

...but had to disable logging (removed all references to drop-and-log-it)...
so am not totally sure what that does to me security-wise.  Just testing
from the laptop it seemed to have no effect but to disable logging.

I cut out all the useless comments in the interests of bandwidth saving.  I
appreciate all the links people have provided... but after looking through
them all, I think doing it myself is better, at least for me.  :-)

What do you guys think?  Will it be relatively secure from people logged on
to the server opening up servers to the Internet?  I'm still looking in to
how I might log any attack attempts, if I ever see any... if it's impossible
to do with what I have here, please hollar.  <g>  (the drop-and-log-it
things have all been commented out.  If I uncomment them, I get logging but
cannot open ports manually after the scrtipt has been run)

Yes, it's very nice.  It's also closed software and hardware- no thanks.

I don't think this is a problem.  Since an incoming connection
wouldn't know how to tell the firewall how to translate to a
particular internal IP number, inbound connections aren't possible to
machines inside unless you specifically map an external port to an
internal address/port.

Your iptables would look something like this:

  IPTABLES=/sbin/iptables
  EXTERNAL_IF=eth0

  $IPTABLES -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $EXTERNAL_IF -j MASQUERADE

and if you wanted to do a specific mapping, add something like this:

  $IPTABLES -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $EXTERNAL_IF -p tcp --dport $EXTERNAL_PORT -j DNAT --to $INTERNAL_IP:22

which would map connections to the firewall on tcp port $EXTERNAL_PORT
to an internal box at $INTERNAL_IP address on its normal secure shell port.

So, as far as I know, your internal users can open LISTENING ports all
day long, but no one outside will be able to get to them unless the
firewall tells them how (with an $IPTABLES command like the second one).

If I am wrong on that, please tell me!  ;-)

Just go to kernel.org and get the linux tarball and compile it:  

  cd /src
  tar xzvf /src_archive/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.18.tar.gz
  cd linux
  make xconfig (or whatever)

Tried this, too.  Still same effect.  I only get actual use of the network
when I use the bf2.4 kernel.  Every other kernel, when configured to the
best of my ability (which should be quite good at this point), gives me
the network devices that are configurable with ifconfig and addressable
with route, but simply do not pass packets.

I can't figure it out.

Link lights on both ends.  Blinky lights on either network interface, but
not on the remote end.

100% packet loss.  As though the network is unreachable, it just sits and
waits until I kill the ping, then reports that it got no responses.

I can ping the address associated with each of the interfaces.

Guh... I dunno.

I'm still wondering what's so special about the kernel that works.

gcc version 2.95.4 20011002 (Debian prerelease)

Oh, golly.  I knew it would be something simple.

I'll try that first thing in the morning.

You know what's so special about the kernel that works?  It has the driver
for one interface in the kernel and loads the other as a module, whereas
the other kernels have them both compiled in... and probably load them in
reverse order.

Damn.  I'll bet that's it.  It's something simple and I didn't try
swapping the cables.

Getting ID chips is one thing, but it is typical for our culture to

Whatever.  The world gets stranger every year.

See '--target' in the rpm man page. The syntax changed a bit somewhere 
in the 4.0.x release series. Depending on how 4.0.3 behaves, it's 
either

  rpm --rebuild --target=athlon whatever.src.rpm

or

  rpm --rebuild --target athlon whatever.src.rpm

Hi ho,

Me again, with a subtle bash befuddlement.  I want to allow a variable
to control how a command's output is redirected, so I figure I'll just
append the variable to the command, right?  If the variable is empty, no
problem; and if it contains ">& /dev/null", it should redirect all the
output into the Great Unknown, right?  Alas, it is not so.

I'm working with bash 2.05a, for your info, and I'm inside a function in
a script file, where I have this line:

	$COMMAND $* ${COMMAND_SUFFIX}

$COMMAND contains the path to apachectl, $* contains simply "start", and
$COMMAND_SUFFIX is defined thus:

	COMMAND_SUFFIX='>& /dev/null'

And the unexpected result is that apachectl spews out it's "usage:"
message twice in a row, apparently once for ">&" and once for
"/dev/null".  If, on the other hand, I substitute the presumably
equivalent line:

	$COMMAND $* >& /dev/null

then the command executes silently, as desired.  So I'm missing some
subtlety of variable expansion, because I'm at a complete loss with this
one.  What's going on here, and more importantly, is there a clean way
around this problem?  All I can think to do is to split $COMMAND_SUFFIX
into multiple variables.

What do you fellows make of this?

Got any juicy feedback on Intel's Linux compiler? I'm looking at version 6. 
gcc compatibility, compile/executable speed, flexibility, useful libs- 
anything at all. Is it worthy? If the cost did not matter, would you choose 
it over gcc? A developer working strictly on IA32/64 might find it to be the 
better tool for the job, as gcc is like one of those eleventy-nine thousand 
piece Sears toolkits. It's nice to have all those pieces, even though you'll 
never use them.

Intel makes much of optimizing for their instruction sets- how big a deal is 
this in the real world? One example: gcc supports pretty much all IA 
instruction sets, except SIMD, which Intel thinks is pretty important. 

thankee kindly,
Carla

Has anyone on the list ever used the MCVE (Mainstreet Credit Verification

been giving me fits.  The guy from mainstreet who's been helping me has been
great, but he doesn't know Perl very well and their API documentations is
rather poor (to put it politely).

I get "noarch" packages built by doing:

I am using 4.0.4.  Version 4.0.2 used to take "--target=noarch".
YMMV.

Hi Rich,

I don't know if you use PHP, perhaps you can help me with a poser. My PHP
works fine, but I want to change the config value 'expose_php' from On to
Off. I went into /usr/local/lib/php/php.ini and changed it. Then I restarted
my httpd daemon. I'm running PHP as an Apache module, so a restart is
supposed to cause it to reread php.ini.

However, the value doesn't change when I run phpinfo(). Do you or one of the
other wizards you know have any suggestions for what I need to do?

Jason,

Your're right. It is because metacharacters are parsed before variable
expansion. Eval is a valid way to handle this, but only if you are quite
certain of the possible values of your variables. Eval on a var containing
"`rm -rf /`" could be devasting. Man bash and search for terms like
metacharacters, operators, pipelines, expansion, and eval.

Kelly,

  The convenience of carrying only one device, and having all phone numbers
instantly available for dialing, makes the slight size difference quite
tolerable.

  I've been using the Kyocera QPC-6035 (on Verizon Wireless) since last
December and I wouldn't consider going back to carrying two separate
devices. Yes, there are a couple of firmware bugs they're working on, and
I've still not figure out why I can't hold the ppp connection to my ISP from
my notebook using the Kyocera as a wireless modem, but all these issues will
be resolved in time.

  If you've sat there and entered a bunch of phone numbers and names, by
hand, into your cell phone, you'll appreciate sycing the unit to jpilot (or
whatever you use) and being able to call anyone in your addressbook,
regardless of which number you want to call.

  Yes, it's bleeding edge technology, but extremely useful and better than
the former method of carrying both. I'd almost always have the cell phone
with me, but not the Palm. Now I do.

  The cell phones I've used, including the Kyocera combo, all come with a
power button. The phone's never on when I'm eating, meeting with people or
just don't want to be disturbed. It's for my convenience, after all.

That would be preferable, but there are no windows systems around here,
none of the addresses it bounced from I've ever sent mail to, etc.
The big thing that makes me somewhat unsure is the subject line.  The
headers from the original bounced message follows, with the first few lines
of the body.

Dave,

  A couple of things.

  First, write to abuse at uu.net and tell them of the problem; that's where
the message originated:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ whois 63.49.204.158 at whois.arin.net
[whois.arin.net]
UUNET Technologies, Inc. (NETBLK-NETBLK-UUNET97DU)
   3060 Williams Drive, Suite 601
   Fairfax, va 22031
   US

   Netname: NETBLK-UUNET97DU
   Netblock: 63.0.0.0 - 63.63.255.255
   Maintainer: UUDA

   Coordinator:
      UUNET, Technical Support  (OA12-ARIN)  help at uu.net
      800-900-0241

  Second, just because you've never sent someone an e-mail message doesn't
mean that your address isn't all over the 'Net. I get Klez virus messages
from folks I've never heard of. There are also a host of spam factories that
send my crap, er, UCE, claiming that I've 'opted in' to be spammed. They
share lists, by the way.

  I'd forward the message, with full headers of course, to uu.net with a
polite note asking them to take the appropriate actions to prevent you from
being spoofed by their customer in the future.

It also depends on how you've configured php at compile time (if you
compiled it yourself).  A phpinfo() will tell you where the active
php.ini file is located if you don't remember or it's in an odd
location.

One other source for harvesting email addresses is browser cache. If your
email address is in a mailto: tag, then that may have been the conduit.

I got lot's of nimda crap by virtue of my webbed domain.

Bill,

In your httpd.conf file, you'll want to add something like

  php_flag expose_php on

If you're running a virtual-host setup, you can turn php boolean stuff 
on and off on a per-host basis. See section 3.2 of the online 
configuration document:

  http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.php

[snip] 

If by that you mean automatically making your 2nd hard drive available at boot, look to /etc/fstab. 

Your computer looks to /etc/fstab to determine what mounts where at boot time.

Message-ID: <GJELJBAKILGBFNJHBMKGIEOHCEAA.CurtisE@CurtisE.net>

Greetings,

I just installed OpenSSH on a RH6.2 box.  I can connect to it with a SSH
client, but can't login.  I get "Permission denied, please try again."  I'm
trying to use the password method of authentication and yes, I've tried many
times and I know I'm using the correct password.  I have even created
another test account with a much more simple password, just in case there is
some issue with special characters or some such nonsense.  The RH box is
using a shadow password file.

Any ideas?  Here is my sshd_config file:

Cooper gave the quick and dirty answer, here, but I'm going to give you a
little more information because, if I'm reading you correctly, you could
use it.  If I confuse you, pretend I was trying to confuse you and making
things up and try to forget everything I wrote, then ask someone else.

lilo.conf is the configuration file for Lilo, the boot loader.  This
utility is used to choose a boot record for loading an operating system at
boot time.  Even DOS has a boot loader, it's just a really simple-minded
and arrogant one that assumes you couldn't possibly have another operating
system or would dream of deviating from the prescribed system
configuration, so it isn't configurable at all.

If you have access to all the operating systems you have installed and
each can be booted with relatively little pain and don't intend to move
any of the drives the main installation of those operating systems, you
don't have to touch lilo.conf.

It sounds like you have a second drive attached to your system already and
are manually mounting a partition from it when you need access, but want
it mounted automatically at boot time.

There is, as you probably guessed, a configuration file that defines which
disk partitions are mounted where in your filesystem.  The configuration
file is called fstab (on GNU/Linux systems) and it's usually located in
/etc.  It's often just parsed by a script that calls mount from the
(usually read-only) filesystem the kernel set up at boot time (based on
options in the boot loader).

If you want the straight-up shiznit on this file, you can probably just
run the following command: man fstab

If you don't care for that sort of thing and want to read my rambling, it
follows.

The standard /etc/fstab is a tab-delimited file of single-row records that
contain the following information in the following order:
<file system>	<mount point>	<type>	<options>	<dump><pass>

The "file system" is usually the device name where the filesystem to be
mounted resides.  This might be /dev/cdrom, /dev/md2, /dev/sda4,
/dev/hdc1, and so on.  It could also be a special keyword for a virtual
filesystem generated by another process or the kernel.  This might be proc
or devfs.

The "mount point" is the place where the root of the mounted filesystem
will join the rest of the filesystem.  Remember that in unix, drives are
fairly transparent to the user and the filesystem (and tools that access
it) doesn't really care how many drives of what type make up its
structure.  So if you want the path to the stuff on that particular disk
to be /usr/local, then that's your mount point.  Remember to make sure
that the mount point is on a filesystem that's already mounted.  That
means both makinig sure that the filesystem containing /usr is defined
previously in fstab and that local exists in that filesystem as a
directory.

"type" is the filesystem type.  That could be ext2, ext3, reiserfs, msdos,
vfat, or whatever.  It's how the partition was formatted.

The "options" vary from type to type and mount script to mount script.  
Probably you want "defaults".  One of the defaults is to automount at boot
time.  Overriding this option requires the "noauto" option.  That's most
often used for removable media that may not be present at boot time, but
has a specific, pre-defined mount point when it is present.

The "dump" field contains a 1 or a 0 to determine whether the filesystem
should be dumped by the dump(8) command.  0 will probably do.  Don't worry
about it.

"pass" is used by fsck at boot time to see when that particular filesystem
should be fscked.  The root filesystem (mounted at /) should be set to 1,
but that's the only hard, fast rule.  Other filesystems on the same
physical disk as the root should have sequential numbers, but filesystems
on different disks can have the same number because the fscks can happen
at the same time.  You probably shouldn't give any filesystem a pass
number of 1 other than the root partition, though, regardless of physical
location... just as a good practice.

Anyway, that's lots of information you don't need.

If any of it's wrong, somebody should tell me because that would mean I am
a big dummy who claims to know things he doesn't really know.

Can we see the output of a verbose session attempt?

Use your usual command line, but with the -v flag first.  Paste us the
output (with any sensitive information modified, of course).

And while I know diddly about Red Hat, I think I know that 6.2 is kind of
old and I wonder if the OpenSSH package you installed uses SSH v1 while
many servers are configured to respond only to v2 connections favorably.

This could also be a PAM configuration issue, so if you use PAM, you might
want to share that information as well.

Politely unhelpful,
J.

Rich, I fully appreciate the entry process, having to redo my phone more
than once when they went gunnysack on me. I know of what you speak. To quote
a public figure, I feel your pain. (:

I recognize that there are a faction like you out there, but an awful lot of
people out there aren't. In my pre-unemployed SIG days, I was working in an
area where wireless was being watched very closely. During this time there
was a survey done of people who carry such devices, and most said they'd
rather carry two great ones than one that was just ok. Even non-geeks saw
that the tech just wasn't there at the time. I think the Treo and the new
(very pretty) Nokia might be changing that. I'd be thrilled if they did. Now
if I could just convince Handspring to put out the Treo in translucent
colors and make it the teensiest bit curvier....<cough>macuser<cough>...

I also agree with you on the power button of your phone. I have a silent
ring option, which allows me to see who called without having to deal with
the phone, and if I do happen to have it on and it rings, I have two
choices: answer and ignore. Caller ID makes the decision very easy. Plus
even when my phone does ring, it's always on vibrate so I don't bother other
people.

I once overheard a call in a public restroom. That was the point at which I
realized not everyone can draw a line quite as clearly as I can.

I'm still excited that someone asked a question on the list that I had an
answer for! It's the little things, really...

No, this is dangerous.  If $* should expand to something with whitespace,
then you get two or more parameters where you had one before.

eval \$COMMAND \$* $COMMAND_SUFFIX

please.

Change that to:

    eval \$COMMAND \$* ${COMMAND_SUFFIX}

And all will be well.  Redirection operators are noticed before
variable substitution, so you can't *interpolate* one without backing
up a level with eval.

Good explanation Jeme. I'm going to quote it in FREE GEEK's computer

A couple of minor additions / corrections:

Just for clarification, lilo is not the only boot loader you can use 
with linux. Another boot loader that is being used by several distros is 
called grub. The main configuration file you'd look for in grub is 
called menu.lst.

/etc/fstab is actually whitespace delimited. Tabs or spaces work equally 
well.

  Yes, this is easy to track. My web site lists "info at ..." so all spam

This would be my guess.  Did you use --with-pam when you ran the configure
script?  After compiling and installing, copy contrib/sshd.pam.generic to
/etc/pam.d/sshd.

Supposed to, but doesn't seem to. Make sure you issue a STOP and then a START to the apache server. RESTART just doesn't seem to work right for all cases.

Well, I don't think I implied that there was only one boot loader in the
world.  I was just pointing out that lilo.conf has pretty much nothing to
do with mounting disks.

	Can anyone think of a reason why a module wont build automatically

	The module loads fine with a test script.  It just refuses to
build via CPAN.  Any ideas?  Below my sig is the full cut and paste from
the xterm in case I left something vital out.  It's pretty big so I
apologise in advance if it makes your eyes bleed or your machine to
execute instruction HCF.

	This doesn't just happen with Term::ReadKey by the way.  I just
used it as an example because it has no module dependencies that I haven't
already met.

	Also, the machine is running Debian 3.0 x86, kernel 2.4.18-bf2.4, 
gcc 2.95.4 20011002, GNU make 3.79.1, and perl 5.6.1.

Hi Pluggers -

I have a simple (but vital) question: Can I reinstall Windows 98 without
overwriting my other partitions using the win98 cd?

Specifically, I have a small vfat partition on my linux system, on which
Windows 98 is installed. I want to wipe the slate clean and
reinstall Windows 98, but I'm worried I'll overwrite my linux partitions
by doing so.

Anyway, if someone could give me the thumbs up for this I'd appreciate it.
I'm fairly certain the answer is 'yes' but I want to make sure...

Thanks,

Tyler

As long as you don't do any fdisk-ing... The DOS format command should
only  make sense of a FAT16/FAT32 partition. The one gotcha might be Win98
stomping your bootloader. Heck, why would you want to use another OS,
anyways? ;-)
You might want to study up on your bootloader of choice and make a boot
floppy. Here's how to do it w/ GRUB.

Win98 does not always play well with others.

When I do this I create and test a linux boot disk, then record my
partition table info, and finally change the partition type on all the
linux partitions to something wierd.

This usually keeps Win98 from screwing things up.

You may also want to format the Win98 partition prior to the install so if
it asks about formatting during install you'll know something is wrong.

You shouldn't have any problems..My brother's computer has a 20M linux 
partition and a 10M Win partition...we installed Winderz AFTER Linux was 
already there....it didn't even see the linux partition...however, as 
always, YMMV, sold as-is, No warranty expressed, written or implied...

Simple, but vital, but also off-topic.

Or shall we say that this list is for discussion of computing related
issues regardless of operating system, distribution licensing, and
hardware platform?

I think we'd definitely need a name change, in that case.

Do either of these support directory navigation too?  I think xxdiff
requires a commandline, "xxdiff <dir1> <dir2>", incantation.  I have
dozens of directories to compare, and was hoping for some navigation.

Most of the two panel filemanagers have the UI I'm looking for, but they
lack the ability to compare the contents of each directory, showing which
files are missing in which directory, which are different, which are
same, etc.

Thanks,

I recommend you report through them as I think it carries more weight if 
abuse at various addresses receive complaints from spamcop.

It used to munge headers but I think it has evolved into a good service.

Not at all off topic when it involves the OS co-existing with any number of Unix systems that are also proprietary and restricted license-wise. 

I'd say (and previous discussions have said as much) that it could even go so far as to include HOW to install Win98 on a seperate partition without destroying the aforementioned Linux partition.

No.

Also, I was wrong about mgdiff. It compares individual files only, not
directories.

But it doesn't matter which operating systems are on the other partitions
(unix, unix-like or otherwise), so how is it relevant to this list?

I'm cc:ing plug-talk.  Further discussion should be there.

I don't understand what you are doing, so this may be a waste of your time and
I apologize if I lead you to a dead end.  

Worker is a two panel file manager, much like Gentoo, xtree from dos, and, I
think, midnight commander. On the third button panel there are a number for
diff buttons and one that is labeled dir-diff.	The way it works, I think,  is
you open a directory in the left panel and select all the files; in the right
panel, select another directory and select all the files there .  Click on the
clockbar to get to the third button panel and then click on the dir_diff
button. A xterm pops up and I believe a diff of the two is generated. If this
is saved or if you have to copy the output to a buffer, I don't know. 

There isn't anything on the Worker web site that explains what these buttons do
so the only way for you to know will be to install it and see if it works.
There are three buttons configured for diffs. Looking at the button commands in
the button configuration mode will probably tell you if this will work for you
if you don't want to run the command blindly. The variables passed to the diff
command are worker specific or I would post them here. Sorry again for not
knowing enough to tell you for sure, this what you are looking for.

I suggested Worker before and someone replied they were not able to compile it
on their box.  I didn't have a problem on a SuSE 8.0 install. When I came cross
it it was 2.4, it is now at 2.5., both compiled fine for me. There is a link
off of the Worker web site to a list of rpms at rpmfind. I included that link
below the Worker home page. 

http://www.boomerangsworld.de/worker/woverview.php3
http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=worker&submit=Search+...

Thank you
Russell

I think the sshd_config file is configured to accept either v1 or v2.  I
also get the same result when trying to authenticate using the ssh client to
connect to the ssh server on the same box.  I would hope that would rule out
a version or compatibility issue.


Here is the verbose output from an authentication attempt:
(I didn't modify anything, because it's just a box I'm using to educate
myself on Linux, it's behind a firewall and does not resolve in the outside

Jeme and Matt may be onto something with PAM.  I did not use the
"--with-pam" option with the configure script.  I don't really know what PAM
is, but I noticed I do have a pam.d in /etc.  So I blew away SSH and
reconfigured with the "--with-pam" option and copied
contrib/sshd.pam.generic to /etc/pam.d/sshd.  Then I had some other issues
many of which I resolved by reconfiguring with the "--with-ipv4-default"
option also.  I've also reverted to the stock sshd_config file with the
exception of the "PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt yes" line which I uncommented
and changed to yes.

Now I cannot connect, but at least I'm getting some clues as to why.  I'm
not sure what to make of the clues though.  Here's what I get when I run
sshd in diagnostic mode:

Here is what I get on the client side when attempting to connect in verbose

Notice the "Read from socket failed: Broken pipe" message in the second to

The messages log just gripes about the same mmap issue:
"Jun 24 01:39:33 elvis sshd[32261]: fatal: mmap(65536): Invalid argument"

So, it would appear (to my untrained eyes) that this mmap issue is the
source of my current problem.  Does this ring any bells with you folks.
This is well above my level of Linux knowledge.

The only thing I can think of at this point is so go back to OpenSSH version
3.2.3p1 which is the version I originally used.  The one I have now is from
a fresh download and it looks like it's a newer version (3.3).  Perhaps 3.3
has some sort of memory bug...

I would sure appreciate any additional ideas.

Thanks,
CurtisE

  Replace the defaults with what you want. Use 'ro' for read only.

Subject: [PLUG] SPAM and the PLUG list
Message-ID: <3D1742F4.4020403@sun.com>

Everyone:

The spam issue has become a rather sore point for many of us on the 
list.  Karl recently gave me admin access to the configuration 
parameters, and I believe I can shut it down once and for all.

However, this change will require those of you who use the news gateway 
to slightly modify the way you use the list.

First of all, you'll have to be subscribed to the list, as the change 
will make it 'subscribers-only'.  You can then use the 'no mail' option 
to not get mail in your inbox.  Just make sure that your From: headers 
include a subscribed address.

That *should* fix it once and for all.  I won't institute the change 
until about mid-week, allowing everyone on the news gateway to get 
subscribed and configured properly.

If, after the change (or before), things don't seem to be working as 
planned, please shoot me (and the other list admins) an email at:

listmaster at lists.pdxlinux.org

And let us know your subscribed email address, wether you use the news 
gateway, and anything else that you thing might be of use.

Thanks,

-Richard

When you build via CPAN, you're building as root, right? Try doing 
this at the cpan prompt:

cpan> ! foreach my $k ( keys %ENV ) { print qq($k -> $ENV{"$k"}\n) }

Then do the same in environment in which you successfully built the 
module by hand. Are there any differences?

Next, look at <perl root>/<perl vers>/CPAN/Config.pm (on my Red Hat 
system, it's /usr/lib/perl5/5.6.1/CPAN/Config.pm). Are the paths 
supplied to the various executables like make, gzip, etc. correct?

As I mentioned in my prior mail "SPAM and the PLUG list", this is 
exactly what will happen when I change it over.  Early Friday I did not 
know just exactly what Wil did to the mmtest list to make it work as he 
did.  Late Friday I had this information, but was unable to institute a 
change due to my taking a trip over the weekend.

As soon as everyone is switched over (hopefully) I'll make the list 
subscriber-only and we can enjoy our spam-free list again.

No, you can't. You must make a Linux boot disk before
doing this, or you won't be a Linux user any more
after you are done. [You won't overwrite the Linux
partition itself, but you will overwrite the MBR.] In
this sense the question is not off-topic; the list
doesn't include many former Linux users.

Last Sunday's Oregonian had a piece in the Forum section about how all
of the high tech gadgets & technology was ruining our current quality
of life (e.g., cell phones, pagers, & email made it possible for work to
follow employees home; people who grew up with computers were
``increasingly unable" to understand how things worked). I'd like to
note that Rich's brief comment is an eloquent refutation of the
article's thesis.

Technology is man's servant; but like any servant, if the master is
lazy or complaisant, it can turn the tables & become the master.

[successful install log snipped]

IIRC, I had an error message similar to this one when I tried to use CPAN
to add some modules about a year ago. At the time I had perl 5.00503
which was very old. When I compiled & installed version 5.6.0, the
problem went away.

Apparently, if your version of perl is too far behind the current rev,
CPAN won't play nice with it.

Cell phones in particular hurt the quality of life. There are few things
more annoying than hearing someone's cell phone ring and then them talking
on it in a restaurant, theatre, etc. It hurts the relaxing atmosphere in a
restaurant.

I have even seen/heard people talking on their cells while they climb a
mountain or hike in a beautiful trail. It drags down the experience to
hear embeciles talking on their cells.

Whatever happened to basic courtesy and being aware of the effects of
actions on others?

Also, of course, we have all seen morons talking and driving. Often they
swerve without realizing it because they think they can do both but it is
an illusion.

I have had lots more problems with people eating and drinking while
driving.  Had the fun experience of helping two different people at different
time out of a crash because they spilled there drink or was trying to get
some fries.  Unfortunately I still drink, eat and drive.

My all time favorite is see some one putting on makeup and driving.  That
more then talking on a cell phone should be illegal!

And people don't really take it seriously if you mention it to them.

I've got a solution that works for me, of course.  I just strike up a
little conversation with the offender when they get off the phone.  I
share details I overheard from their telephone conversation.

"So, you close the deal on Tuesday?  I mean, the house on Alameda, of
course."

"What?"

"You're buying that house on Alameda.  So you're going to be out closing
that deal on Tuesday afternoon, you and your wife?"

"That was a private telephone call."

"No, it wasn't.  Everyone on the bus heard it.  If you want a PRIVATE
telephone call, use a telephone booth or your home phone."

As if driving weren't deadly enough...

After the eval pass, it's now:

and so it's as if you typed that, instead of what you started with.
Except that redirects in $COMMAND_SUFFIX are now active.

All you would have to do, is subscribe to the list, check the 'no mail' 
option in the configuration, and then continue posting via NNTP as usual.

Note that if the email address in your From: line does *not* match the 
subscribed address, your messages will be held for moderation.  After 
they get put in the moderation queue, we can send them to the list, 
reject them, or whatnot.  Since the administrators will be notified in 
this way, we can alert the poster and help them fix the misconfiguration.

It is. 

It's called "Driving while encumbered" and covers anytime the officer believes you to be doing too many "other" things while driving. My first wife was given a ticket for this while driving home from work one day. All she had was a small glass of pepsi, with a lid even. 

The problem isn't what laws are on the books, it's that the laws are not enforced. 

Everyone agrees that talking on the phone (without a hands free kit) should be illegal. What most don't know is that there is a law already covering it, they just don't use it. Sorta like those folks that smoke under 18. It's illegal, but they don't enforce it.

I am trying to route one network to another, but I am having troubles in
doing so.

Here is my scenerio...

machine A is my firewall router. 192.168.0.1
machine B is my desktop. eth0 192.168.0.10, eth1 192.168.1.1
machine C is a new computer. eth0 192.168.1.2

Machine A to B connect fine, as does B to C. Machine B will not route
traffic from C to A. Can someone help me in figuring this out?

Actually, I just posted, so it's working.

And I'm unsure of why we need to shut down the NNTP posting alternative,
since the SPAM has always been injected via SMTP.

If I have to subscribe to each mailing list, I'm probably just going
to leave instead.  Buh bye.

Ok, I found out that Machine B is actually sending to machine A. eth0 on
my firewall is recieving the packets but seem to be dropping them. I
guess I will start playing with the firewall. Should my firewall have a
route for the x.x.1.0 network?

The change won't shut down the NNTP posting, it will simply restrict it 
to subscribers-only.  Meaning you have to be subscribed to the list, 
even though you don't have to actually get mail FROM the list.  You can 
still post, just as long as you are subscribed.

That's up to you, but the alternative is the SPAM we've been seeing, and 
IMHO it's getting worse as of late.  Adverts for ZOO pr0n?  I think 
closing down the list to allow ONLY those people who are actually 
subscribed TO the list to post is the way to do it.

Again, you don't have to actually get mail in your inbox if you're 
subscribed to the list.  Hell, if there is anyone else *besides* Randal 
who uses the gateway, I can set you all up without you even having to 
lift a finger.  Just let me know who you are, and I'll do the necessary 
key-punching/mouse-clicking.

The reason is that the SPAM was being injected from non-subscribed
addresses.  Since the people who were using the NNTP gateway were not
subscribed in the general case, the list wasn't closed to members
only, as it had been previous to the gateway.

Randal> If I have to subscribe to each mailing list, I'm probably just
Randal> going to leave instead.  Buh bye.

Well, you don't _have_ to subscribe to read _or_ post.  The only
impact will be when posting messages to one of the "unsubscribed"
newsgroups, your message will be queued for inspection by the list
administrators.  They will presumably then approve your message for
the list.

Via SMTP, I can totally agree.

But why stop the NNTP gateway if that wasn't the source of the problem?

I really don't think spammers are running around connecting to random
NNTP ports just to push spam.  Really.  I don't.  Prove me wrong.

Thanks to Paul Heinlein and others
who all suggested using the --target commandline switch.

Unfortunately this is too easy. -:)

What I was after was how to modify (or suppliment) the appropriate
config rpm config/macro files so that I would simply do rpm --rebuild
and be done.

Besides, I also want to adjust some default switches in the
`optflags' macro for the athlon.  Using `--target athlon' only gets me
the default.

I guess what I'm after is a better understanding of where to go and
what to change so my athlon system behaves the way I want _by
default_.  I know people on this list have mucked  around with
personalised ~/.rpmrc files, or system-wide /etc/rpm/macros and /etc/rpmrc
files.

Please show me the way :-)

I'm not - that's the way the configuration works.  Either way, when a 
message is posted, by SMTP or NNTP, it goes through checks.  One of 
these checks is to determine if the poster is subscribed to the list. 
Right now, the subscribed check is OFF.

> But didn't that come in via the SMTP portal?


Yes it did.  If I turn ON the above check, however, it will restrict 
BOTH SMTP and NNTP postings to 'subscribers-only'.

If there's something I'm missing on the configuration side of Mailman, 
someone PLEASE let me know.  But from what I can tell from mucking 
around and checking out every single admin option I can find, the only 
way to keep spammers away is to make the list subscriber-only, and that 
includes the NNTP gateway as well.  There *might* be a conf file 
somewhere that will allow the bypassing of subscriber checks for 
messages from the NNTP gateway, but it's not obvious on the admin pages.

OK, this is how I understand the situation and the changes being made.

Randal said:
>I missed something though.  I thought the SPAM was injected via
>the SMTP portal.  Why are you hacking the NNTP portal?

It was being injected via SMTP because the list was open to all posters, not just subscribers only.  Originally (at least when I joined) the list was subscribers only.  Then the list changed servers.  During this change, Karl thought that it would be nice to have the NNTP portal to the list (which it obviously has been for some).  However, Karl thought that in order to allow posting from NNTP, he needed to change the mailing list from being subscriber-only, to wide open.  This is when the spam started coming in via SMTP, because mail was being allowed from anyone.  The change that is being enforced is to switch the mailing list back to a subscribers only list which will eliminate the spam since it comes from unsubscribed addresses.  The only caveat to this is that in order to keep the posting via NNTP, one now needs to subscribe to the list and when posting via NNTP make sure that his/her From: header is correct.  So, the NNTP portal will still be functional, and with the "no mail" option of mailman, you won't have to get the list via SMTP.  If you have another solution of how to solve the problem, I'm sure Richard and Karl would be open to suggestions.

The SPAM was injected via SMTP from an unsubscribed address.

All you have to do to make things work exactly as they have been working
for you is subscribe to the list and check the "no mail" option.

It's pretty simple and you can go back to doing things as you've been
doing them.

And there will be less SPAM because the list will be open to subscribers
only.

> But didn't that come in via the SMTP portal?

It came from an unsubscribed address.  We're closing the list to
unsubscribed addresses on all portals.

It's important to remember that you don't have to receive mail as a result
of subscription.  There is a "no mail" option.

> But why stop the NNTP gateway if that wasn't the source of the
> problem?

Nobody's stopping the NNTP gateway.  We're just adding a check to see that
the NNTP poster's FROM: address matches the address of a subscribed list
member.

One way to do this would be for the non-subscriber bounces to go
through some kind of procmail like thing that looked for NNTP gateway
signatures and then auto-approved those.

	Yep.  That was it.  I had configured CPAN before I did a bunch of
apt-gets.  Per your suggestion, I blew it away and reconfigured.  Not
quite sure what was different (I should have saved it and diff'ed
hehe) but it works now.  Thanks for your help!

What specific entry (or entries) in the /usr/lib/rpm config files
determines that, by default, my machine builds for i586?

This is a Mandrake 8.2 system (running on an athlon-mp).
For various reasons Mandrake's default build env. is always i586.
I'm supposing they get this behaviour via something in these config
files.

I've grepped the files for i586 and found several entries.
The most relevant thing I can find is the section:

#==============================================================================
# ---- config.guess platform macros.
#	Macro(s) similar to the tokens used by configure.
#
%_build			%{_host}
%_build_alias		%{_host_alias}
%_build_cpu		%{_host_cpu}
%_build_vendor		%{_host_vendor}
%_build_os		%{_host_os}
%_host			i586-mandrake-linux-gnu
%_host_alias		i586-mandrake-linux-gnu
%_host_cpu		i586
%_host_vendor		mandrake
%_host_os		linux-gnu
%_target		%{_host}
%_target_alias		%{_host_alias}
%_target_cpu		%{_host_cpu}
%_target_vendor		%{_host_vendor}
%_target_os		%{_host_os}


in  /usr/lib/rpm/macros. 

Note that %_target takes its value from  %_host.

But when I put

%_host			athlon-mandrake-linux-gnu
%_host_alias		athlon-mandrake-linux-gnu
%_host_cpu		athlon

in a separate /etc/rpm/macros file, it makes no difference,
so  I'm missing something.

Yeah, you were on the right track with your earlier message.  Your
firewall needs to know where to send packets destined for 192.168.1.x.
It isn't a directly connected network, so it doesn't know what to do.
It tries ARP'ing but nothing replies.  Tell the firewall to route such
packets via your internal gateway machine, whatever that is, .10 I
guess.  You'll have to figure out the proper syntax for that in your
firewall.

Is machine B acting as just a router, or is it trying to do NAT as well?
If it is just a router, you will need to change the netmask on your
firewall to include both subnets --> 255.255.0.0.  As it stands now, all
packets from 192.186.1.0 are in a totally separate subnet from the
subnet that the firewall is using. In other words, any address from
192.168.1.0 is not in the range of address that the firewall is willing
to work with, so it drops them.

You probably need to specify the gateway of eth1 as the ip address of
eth0, not just to speed things up, but to clear up any possible
confusion in the routing.

Ok, I understand what you are saying. I couldn't figure why arp was
shouting, but now I know. .10 is my internal gateway.

I would recommend using Woody with the bf2.4 boot floppies.

Get yerself a 2.4 kernel right off the bat.

BTW, another solution is to turn on proxy ARP on your internal
gateway.  That will cause the it to answer ARP requests for the .1.x
addresses.  This can be useful if you are not controlling the upstream
router (your firewall, but it could also be a DSL gateway at your
ISP).  I have had to do this in the past.

If I can get a list of people who are not subscribed and post *only* via 
the NNTP server, I can also simply add them to the whitelist file.  As 
far as I know at the moment however, Randal is the only person on that list.

Do any of you know any companies that would be interested in sponsoring
(if that is the right word) OSU to build a linux lab for students?

I am told there are 2 main things preventing a linux lab, currently.

1.  Support is already at their breaking point as far as workload is
concerned.  And they would have to drop support for an OS inorder to add a
new one.

2.  Political reasons such as HP donates (non-linux) computers to OSU
since HP has a campus here is Corvallis.

I believe that if OSU was getting donations from somewhere else that the
support might find that they have more time to spend with their families
if they switch from HP-UX to linux.  I've been trying to create a proposal
to give to OSU, but I know I will need to make it appear as a donation if
I want to get real results.

Anyone know how to help?

Thanks,
Jason

You might try to get in contact with HP, since they seem to be doing things with linux/open source.

they even have linux workstations and desktops:

Potato with Linux 2.4 or woody with 2.4 should work fine.

Woody has much more features, while Potato is very mature.

My experience is that woody is great for the Desktop.
Potato is great for the server...that is until woody get's released.

you can not ping from a 192.168.x.x network to a 192.168.n.x network like 
you can with a public IP block, or telnet and HTTP.

In that case, you are wrong.  You just can't address them _across_ a
public network, where "public network" is defined as the routers that
don't route those addresses.  ;-)

On your private network, you can route anything you want in just about
any way you want.

That's correct.  As long as it's a private net, you can use any addresses you want and nobody is going to know or care.  The 192.168.x.x and 10.x.x.x address ranges are just historical conventions.

Since nobody has yet answered my questions I thought I'd answer them
myself.

With a lot of trial-and-error and several hours spent tracing things I
discovered the answer to my own questions.  Basically the
architecture that rpm keys off of is the one given by `uname -m'.

In addition, in /usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc there is the line:

buildarchtranslate: i686: i586

which says that if `uname -m' returns i686 then translate that to i586.

So, until I rebuild the mandrake kernel as an "athlon" kernel I have
defined  /etc/rpmrc to be:

optflags: athlon -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -march=athlon-mp -ffast-math -fno-strength-reduce
buildarchtranslate: i686: athlon

Note that the newest gcc-3.1.1 has the -march-athlon-mp switch.
Since I'm running athlon-mp processors I thought I'd  take
advantage of this---which started me down this primrose path.

Actually, it's part of the spec for internetworking generally.  See
RFC1918.

The actual reserved private blocks (that all public networks should
specifically drop) are:
10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16

If you are going to use address space outside of those ranges for private
networks that have an intenet gateway of some kind, expect strange things
to happen.  I know of one state agency where the network administrator was
a lunkhead and used a block that was not designated as private for a
network that was behind a NAT firewall and ended up making it impossible
for the folks in his department to reach a good chunk of their analogous
federal agency.  See, he'd coincidentally chosen their public address
space to use as his private address space.

Anyway, when we say that this addresses are "unroutable", we're really
saying that they're not globally routable.  There's nothing about the
implementation of TCP/IP that makes these addresses unusable.  We've
simply made a gentleman's agreement to not use that space in public and to
either drop those packets or ignore those advertised routes on our public
networks.

Personally, I think you shouldn't even leave this up to your ISP.  You
should be dropping packets that source to the designated private blocks at
your network ingress point (and translating them or dropping them at your
egress point).

I finally got ssh working.  It turns out that Jeme and Matt were on the
right track with PAM.  Unfortunately I had already disposed of the tarball,
so I had to download again and ended up getting v3.3 as opposed to v3.2.3.
v3.3 enables by default the "UsePrivilegeSeparation" option whereas 3.2.3
did not.  Apparently having UsePrivilegeSeparation on RedHat Linux 6.2 with
kernel 2.2.? results in
the mmap error messages I was getting after rerunning configure with the
"--with-pam" option on v3.3.

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=openssh-unix-dev&m=102495678309336&w=2

Anyway, I ended up going back v3.2.3 for the time being and adding the
"--with-pam" which fixed the original problem.  I'll upgrade when they patch
this issue.

Many thanks to Jeme and Matt for pointing me in the right direction.

If you want to use openssh 3.3 and the privilege seperation option
(which, according to Theo De Raadt, you do) with a linux 2.2 kernel,
then you need to apply the attached patch from Solar Designer, the
maintainer of the Openwall linux distribution. If you don't apply the
patch, you get the quoted mmap error when running openssh 3.3 on a 2.2
kernel.

The privilege seperation option is a nice piece of work.

Unfortunately, that's not the way Mailman works.  There is only ONE 
place to select wether the list is open OR subscribe-only.  AFAIK, there 
isn't an option to allow anonymous news gateway posts AND make the 
regular email list subscriber only.

I'm sure someone with more programming skill than I could hack it up to 
make it perform that way, however I've only a smattering of perl, and 
Mailman is coded in Python.  Perhaps I'll submit a request to the 
developers, asking if this is possible for this and/or future revisions 
of Mailman.

Subject: [PLUG] smbmount via ssh tunneling
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206250825470.24485-100000@glenfiddich.cse.ogi.edu>

One of my ongoing tasks at work is to test and implement technologies 
that enhance our staff's ability to collaborate with remote 
researchers.

Getting remote users access to our local filesystems is one area 
that's proven sticky in the past. NFS is a hassle because its 
authorization model is host-based rather than user-based, and we're 
not in a position to trust remote networks or, worse, remote 
workstations that receive dynamic IP addresses from untrusted ISPs. A 
VPN solution isn't currently in place, and won't be for some time.

SMB/CIFS, on the other hand, provides user-level authentication, so I 
spent some time yesterday getting SMB traffic tunneled via SSH.

Here's a names-have-been-changed overview of the relevant parts of our 
network infrastructure:

* loginhost -- A Linux box that provides general login and education
               services to our faculty and staff; if you've got an
               account on our network, you can login to this host. 
               Most user authentication is done against an NIS map.

* smbhost   -- A NetworkAppliance filer that provides NFS exports and 
               SMB/CIFS shares; all local home and projects 
               directories are stored here. It authenticates NFS 
               requests against NIS and SMB/CIFS requests against our
               NT domain server.

I was successfully able to mount '//smbhost/sharepoint' from my Linux 
box at home, tunneling traffic via ssh.

At first, I tried things strictly by Hoyle, using the default
netbios-ssn port (139/tcp):

1. In one xterm, I established the tunnel to smbhost via loginhost. I 
   had to do this as root on my Linux box because only root can
   redirect ports 0 - 1023:

   ssh -C -L 139:smbhost:139 me at loginhost.work.domain

2. In a second xterm, I mounted the drive. Again, I had to do this as 
   root (but see below):

   smbmount '//localhost/sharepoint' /mnt/tmp \
     -o username=ntusername/NTDOM

   I was prompted for my NT password, and then

Success! Everything worked as planned. I was able to read, write, and
even execute stuff out of that directory.

Next, I tried to do the same procedure in such a way that didn't 
require root access. Note that this method requires making two 
binaries suid root on Linux systems:

  chmod u+s /usr/bin/smbmnt
  chmod u+s /usr/bin/smbumount

1. In one xterm, establish the tunnel, but use a non-standard port:

   ssh -C -L 5566:smbhost:139 me at loginhost.work.domain

2. Mount the drive using the port= option:

   smbmount '//localhost/sharepoint' ~/mnt \
     -o username=ntusername/NTDOM,port=5566

Success!

One oddity is that the all smb-mounted files and directories show up
in the local filesystem as owned by the mounting user. For example,
when I mounted 'sharepoint,' all the files in that directory appeared
to be owned by user 'heinlein.' I wasn't able to do anything in
directories to which I wouldn't ordinarily have write access (e.g., I
tried to create a file in an off-limits directory, but couldn't), but
I was able to create stuff in directories I own. So a local directory
listing was confusing, but access was allowed or denied appropriately.

I have some lingering question concerning the encryption of lack
thereof on SMB traffic. The SMB packets between loginhost and smbhost
has been reverted to its native state by loginhost's sshd.

* Does anybody know if any of that SMB traffic is encrypted?
* What parts?
* Is that configurable? How?

Thanks.

There are no traces of wu-ftp on the server at all. I've checked xinetd for 
entries related to it, and can't find any. I can't find annything called execv 
either.

How do I stop this from trying to start??

I need postfix to accept email for multiple domains.

there is a mx record for each domain that points to 'server.dynu.com'

in my main.cf file i have

mydomain2 = server2.com
mydomain3 =server3.com

then I also have:
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost, $mydomain, $mydomain,
        mail.$mydomain, www.$mydomain, ftp.$mydomain, $mydomain2,
        $mydomain3

this has worked for me in the past
http://plug.skylab.org/200109/msg01667.html

but, I just did this again and its still bouncing back any emails to
user at mydomain2.com

any thoughts? or pointers? or a better way to handle this?

Just to get things clear ... does the follow grep return absolutely 
nothing?

  grep ftpd /etc/xinetd.conf /etc/xinetd.d/*

Thanks Russell,

I was going to try this, but my search function is fubared in my mailer, 
and I don't have a complete set of archives.  :)

I added these to the 'can post' list.  Well - the ones that are 
obviously good, anyway.  Unfortunately, in doing so I also had to 
immediately make the list subscriber-only.

If anyone has any problems posting to the list, please let me know about it.

Hey - I just got my hands on a Twoooooo eeeeighty ssssix commpuuuuter.
This is a coal-fired unit with a real stuffing box and authentic fiber 
packing for the pistons. Lots of pretty brass and Bakelite inside, and the 
double-acting, triple-expansion engine still works. The rectifier for the 
power supply is a pair of 5Y3 vacuum tubes.

(No seriously, I wonder if I can still get the 80287 math co-porcessor for 
it! Thanks Dave, this is GREAT!) 

Question 1: What Linux distro will run on it? Yggdrasil?

Question 2: Does anyone have a DOS 2.0, 3.11, or 3.2 floppy disk (yes, this 
means 5 1/4" dia.) hanging around?

You must stop and restart xinetd.

Xinetd is running as a daemon.  When the configs change the service must be restarted to properly parse the new configs...

This line shows ofter removing wu-ftp from my RH 7.0 box.

Jun 24 05:36:31 www xinetd[29254]: execv( /usr/sbin/in.ftpd ) failed: No such 
file or directory (errno = 2)

There are no traces of wu-ftp on the server at all. I've checked xinetd for 
entries related to it, and can't find any. I can't find annything called execv 
either.

How do I stop this from trying to start??

Follow-up questions:

* Is there an ftpd entry in /etc/inetd.conf?

* Have you HUP-ed xinetd in a while? I'm wondering if there's some 
  kruft in the running daemon that's been excised from the filesystem.

* Failing all else, do you get anything by doing

  grep -r 'in.ftpd' /etc

I'm sure I should know what HUPping is, but I'm in the dark on it. 

I've started and stopped xinetd with xinetd --stop and xinetd --stop (I think it 
worked)

Does that sound like a solution? I'll know tomorrow for sure ;-)

I ran grep -r 'in.ftpd' /etc and got a response from webmin.

killall -HUP xinetd

This will cause xinetd to restart.

When running CVS 1.11 on RH 7.2, when I issue a 'cvs up' command, my
permissions get changed.

Before:

After

  -rw-r--r--    1 cpoe     cvs           225 Jun 25 09:03 test_all.pl

I need to chmod them back to use these tests, but my coworkers do not
experience a permission change.  Any ideas?

One of the things that Linus did right way back when, was to refuse to
support the 80286 chip. For a number of technical reasons (most of which I
forget) it was more work than it was worth. The solution used to be Minix.
Don't know if that's still true.

Unix operating systems have a standard system call signal() that 
allows the kernel or a user to communicate with a running process.

The user-space utility kill (see 'man kill') and the shell built-in
function of the same name (see 'help kill') are used to send signals,
the most common of which is TERM (aka SIGTERM, signal number 15), so
the following commands are all equivalent ways of stopping a process
with PID 1453:

  # using shell function
  kill            1453
  kill -s SIGTERM 1453
  kill -s TERM    1453
  kill -s 15      1453
  kill -SIGTERM   1453
  kill -TERM      1453
  kill -15        1453
  # using system utility
  /bin/kill            1453
  /bin/kill -s SIGTERM 1453
  /bin/kill -s TERM    1453
  /bin/kill -s 15      1453
  /bin/kill -TERM      1453
  /bin/kill -SIGTERM   1453
  /bin/kill -15        1453

Do 'kill -l' to see a list of all the signals available on your 
system. (And do '/bin/kill -l' to see the difference between your 
shell's kill function and the system utility.)

Applications can be configured to "catch" most signals and then do
special things. Apps are often setup to reread their configuration
files when sent SIGHUP. To get xinetd to re-read its configuration 
file(s), you'd do

  kill -HUP <pid of xinetd>

which often amounts to any of the following

  kill -HUP $(cat /var/run/xinetd.pid)
  kill -HUP $(pidof xinetd)
  /etc/init.d/xinetd reload

xinetd is pretty good about logging what it's doing, so take a peek at 
/var/log/messages after you've HUP-ed it to see what it says.

Subject: [PLUG] postfix question

I need postfix to accept email for multiple domains.

there is a mx record for each domain that points to 'server.dynu.com'

in my main.cf file i have

mydomain2 = server2.com
mydomain3 =server3.com

then I also have:
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost, $mydomain, $mydomain,
        mail.$mydomain, www.$mydomain, ftp.$mydomain, $mydomain2,
        $mydomain3

this has worked for me in the past
http://plug.skylab.org/200109/msg01667.html

but, I just did this again and its still bouncing back any emails to
user at mydomain2.com

any thoughts? or pointers? or a better way to handle this?

As a side note, I used to use "-1" instead of "-HUP" until one fateful day
while admining systems for an ISP that shall remain unnamed.  So I was
typing away and all of a sudden I lose my connection to the server.
"Hmm...  that's odd."  Panic then ensues with another administrator
combing through the server to see if we were hacked.  I just happened to
be going through my history file to see if there was anything I had done
that may have brought the box down.  Yep, leaving that dash off before the
1 is a bad thing.  So from that point on, I decided to not use the numeric
signals, and only use HUP, etc.

Almost certainly the MMU.

Probably the solution is to put two shiny nickels together and buy
yourself a 386.

I don't have access to the server right now, but it seems like I have to
modify 2 things for the virtual hosts to work correctly, mydestination
is one, look near the end of the config file for the other.

`SIGHUP' does something else with xinetd.  Why they didn't

                      arbitrarily  picked  servers will be killed
                      to satisfy  the  limit;  this  will  happen
                      after any servers are terminated because of
                      failing the remote location or access  time
                      checks.   Also,  if  the INTERCEPT flag was

Steve,

Thanks for posting this patch as I've been banging my head against the 
wall as I have a SuSE 6.4 system with a 2.2.20 kernel I've been trying 
to get OpenSSH 3.3 running on. 

Tony

  Does xinetd work differently than inetd? I've the latter on my highly
patched RH 6.2 systems and I've used /etc/rc.d/init.d/inetd stop and ...
start rather than a SIGHUP.

Doh! Thanks for the correction. It's a good thing there's no "lemon 
law" concerning advice offered on PLUG :-)

Apache uses USR2 to "gracefully" reread httpd.conf, allowing each
httpd child to finish its current work before dying, while HUP forces
a reread Right Now, killing all existing children regardless of their
status -- so maybe the xinetd developers were taking their cue from
the Apache folks. Who knows?

Ok, got that working..
Now I am curious if I can use a smtp server remotely to relay email. I'm
sure this is possible.. and probably just needs me to turn something on.
Right now I am using my companies mail server for my outgoing email... for
my personal email address which is a different email service. I want to do
all my outgoing mail through my personal server which is located elsewhere.
How can I can I allow a few IP addresses to use the server to send mail
(relay)?

Sending a stop and then a start isn't the same thing as sending a HUP
signal.

One actually stops the service's processes and restarts them whereas the
other simply triggers an chunk of code internal to the process.

You have a couple of options, one is ip based, only certain machines are
allowed to relay, the other is user authentication.  The latter one uses
machine accounts and passwords to verify authentication, the advantage
is that any user with an account on the machine is able to relay from
where ever, but it cannot be used by anyone else as a relay.  The
disadvantage of the latter one is that the users email client must
support authentication of smtp.  Most modern mailers do.

I don't remember specifics, but I do remember that I was surprised at
how easy it was to implement (I've configured server both ways).

i've dug around the main.cf file and didn't come across anything like this

  I'm running floppyfw here with logging sent to my main workstation/server.
All I've ever seen in /var/log/messages are denied ssh attempts. Am I
looking in the wrong log file to see port probes or are they not noted and
logged by floppyfw?

Thanks,

Rich

And to further muddy the waters, ip networking devices don't inherently
care about RFC-1918 networks (192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/8, and 10.0.0.0/8),
unless we make them care via access lists, filtering, etc.

Duh, sorry, I see this was already hashed over. I need to wait until I'm
_all_ caught up on my email after a week and a half in the middle of the
Pacific.

Anyhow, I'm at the Cisco Networkers conference right now, and I'm pretty
dissappointed to see that all the IBM workstations for public use are
running Winders rather than one of our more useful operating systems.

Well, I'm sure you brought your Linux install CDs with you, right?  It

I'm starting to see some port 22 probes. Maybe in connection with the 
OpenSSH vulnerability that's been mentioned lately? 

It seems like a pretty big deal as I received an email from SuSE's 
Security mailing list and they ranked it a severity 9 out of 10 so it's 
quite severe. They were recommending disabling SSH or block external 
access to SSH until details of the vulnerability were published.

Only 66 Don? You can have some of mine, I've plenty to pass around.

It appears the smtp activity was due to lyris (used by two other lists to
which I'm subbed) getting its knickers in a twist about my MX (which is done
by aracnet) and fell back to my A record (I'm not running a mail server).

My firewall is h/w (SMC Barricade). That's where the logs are from.

Ok another technical question.
Who'll be the first to give me a correct answer.
Step right up ... :-)


I've built a new 2.4.18-20mdk kernel using `-march=athlon-mp'
in the compilation lines.  But when the kernel is all built, installed
and booted, `uname -m' still returns "i686" instead of "athlon".

I've looked through the kernel source and various makefiles and I've
searched the output of the build (all 44665 lines) but can't find
where this is set w/in the kernel.  Can anyone point me in the right
direction.

Yea SuSE's response was pretty quick and they've already released RPMs 
for OpenSSH 3.3p1. Heck they've even gone so far as to support SuSE 6.4 
even through they technically stopped supporting it as of June 17th. 
Apparently RPMs for SuSE 6.4 will be coming a bit later.

Subject: [PLUG] Deciphering ethereal capture
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206251648280.2390-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I'm trying to find out why ncftp (and ftp) have stopped working properly.
To this end I installed ethereal and captured the packets as I used ncftp to
log into an ftp server down in Salem. Now I need help in interpreting the
output.

  The file contains some packets from CUPS (the printing system) even though
the printers are turned off and nothing's in the print queue. Then I see the
connection being made (via Aracnet, too) and I'm logged in anonymously.
However, as soon as I type 'ls' the system freezes. After a short time I
killed the process with ctrl-q.

  Is someone willing to translate the file results for me and teach me how
to interpret what ethereal captures? I printed the output to a text file so
it's in English but still meaningless to me.

TIA,

Rich

The last time you asked this question, I replied:

   Rich>   Since you asked, the gzipped dump.log is attached (it's 73.2K
   Rich> naked). I cannot interpret it, but someone more guru than I can,
   Rich> I'm sure.

   That wasn't an optimal format for analysis.  Try:

     tcpdump -i eth0  -s 1500 -w /tmp/dump.log

   instead.  Or even:

     tcpdump host ftp.sscgis.state.or.us -s 1500 -w /tmp/dump.log

   That'll provide something that can be loaded into ethereal and
   analyzed.

Notice that the second tcpdump command restricts what it listens for
to the host involved.  Why don't you collect a session and plunk the
collected file (/tmp/dump.log) somewhere people can get to and post a
URL and maybe some bored/interested person will take a look for you.

Run it from as far upstream as you can get (i.e., on your firewall if
possible).

Russell,

  I ran the ftp session after starting ethereal. Will running tcpdump first,
then loading that into ethereal provide different results than ethereal
provides directly? I'm trying to understand, not denying what you wrote
before.

  The last time I used tcpdump with a raw output. Now I've installed
ethereal and let it capture the packets directly. There are some CUPS udp
entries at the beginning and end of the file with the tcp packets for the
ftp session taking up the rest of the data; as far as I can tell.

  I put the file on my web site (since I don't run a ftp server here). It's
probably not visible on the site, but the URL is:

	http://www.appl-ecosys.com/publications/ftp-trace.report.gz

It's 8.8K in size.

Thanks,

To slightly clarify those muddy waters, the private networks listed above
are incorrect.  The reserved private netblocks are:
192.168.0.0/16
172.16.0.0/12
10.0.0.0/8

(Of course, 172.16.0.0/8 doesn't make any sense, so maybe this post was
just clarifying the obvious.)

Thanks.

Another internal network block is:
169.254.0.0/16  

This is used for "link-local" addressing.  You'll see it creep into
systems (especially Windows) when an interface is configured for 
DHCP, but no DHCP server is available.

Other netblocks I won't accept packets from:
0.0.0.0/8
240.0.0.0/4

The latter is probably just paranoia -- but if anyone was ever
to send a packet with such as a source address, it's bogus.

It is something that ethereal can load.  Ethereal can capture stuff
too, but more importantly, ethereal is a packet exploration tool.
When you give us already decoded stuff (like the ftp-trace.report
file), we can't use the exploration features, which makes analysis
harder and probably not worthwhile.

  Oh. OK. I'll run the tcpdump and put that on the web site in place of the
existing file.

Russell,

  Done. The file, dump.log, is at
              http://www.appl-ecosys.com/publications/dump.log

It's a binary file.

  Where do I start reading to get more familiar with tracing packets and
interpreting the ethereal output? The TCP/IP book?

Thanks,

The one I downloaded with wget from that URL wasn't a binary.  It
looked like this:

When I do:

/tmp/dump looks different.  Like a binary.

Uh, by running ethereal and poking around?  It helps to have a basic
understanding of TCP/IP.  There is a man page.  There is a website
(ethereal.com)

apt-get install xserver-xfree86

I've found that I often forget to install the X server.  It's not strictly
a requirement for any of the X packages.

Oh, you might also want to append the name of your favorite window manager
to that.

i.e., apt-get install xserver-xfree86 enligtenment eterm

or whatever.

Oh, and I have no idea what rpm -qa does, but if I had to infer from
context, I think you're looking for

dpkg -l

Remember that strict dependencies are handled by apt, but sometimes things
are not stricly dependencies, but quite nice to have in conjunction with
one another (like an xserver with enlightenment or an xterm with your
xserver).

If you want a particular utility but don't know what package it's in, try
apt-cache search utilityname

That'll often get you there.

dpkg -l <-- will list what you have install or have removed
dpkg -L <package name> <-- will list all files installed by the package 
including path

apt-cache search <search word> will show you packages where that word appears 
in the (I'm not exactly sure what, but you can usually find what your looking 
for)

dpkg -S </path/to/file/and/filename> <-- will tell you what package installed 
what file

My favorite trick with this is 
dpkg -S $(which <package name>) 

for example

planck:~# dpkg -S $(which ncftp3)
ncftp: /usr/bin/ncftp3

Message-ID: <970107911.1025067833755.JavaMail.root@monkey>

The symptoms describe almost perfectly a case of trying to run a
non-passive FTP through a firewall.  As soon as FTP tries to open up the
data port from the server back to your computer (after the initial control
connection) it hangs.  The "ls" command triggers it.

Make sure that your ~/.ncftp/prefs file is set up for passive mode only.

Nope, it wasn't Sean. Aracnet handles MX for herring.org. For some reason,
the IP didn't reverse lookup for me when I tried it before sending off the
email to Q7's upstream. I'm subscribed to a couple of lists hosted at Q7 and
powered by Lyris. It appears Lyris failed to deliver to the MX record
(Aracnet glitch?) and fell back to delivery to the A record (and I have port
25 blocked since I don't run a mail server).

Many Thanks for thorough answers, but as I was poking around I got an error 
from ext3 about a filename of the wrong length for something or other. I 
think I may have a failing hard disk-groan.  As I was trying to reinstall -an 
old habit from Windows-- I found it couldn't do things like initiate the swap 
partition.

(I'm lousy at trimming posts, so sorry...)

Thanks, Russell, for the tip on worker.  I tried it, but didn't install it
correctly, so I didn't see the diff buttons on the third "page".  I found
that by selecting a directory in each pane, and then hitting the "diff
other" button gave me `diff` output of both directories.  I knew diff 
could do this, but needed a "visual" method to get this under control.

The output is mostly useful--it says "Only in <directory x>: filename",
so you can see what files only exist in one directory and what files
only exist in the other directory.  This is a step closer, but I'm
still looking for something "fancy".  I got used to a nice tool (there
are several actually) under Windows, but can't find anythink like it
so far for Linux.

For now, I have been using gentoo with a custom button I specified to
call xxdiff on the directories of each pane.  This works okay, and I
suppose I could do the same in worker, but a tight, integrated solution
would be best.

Oh well, thanks to all for your suggestions.  I can get by on the
cobblestone approach I'm using so far.

Steve,

  I understand this. Both ncftp and ftp are set in passive mode, and they
worked just fine for a couple of years. This is a behavior new within the
past couple of months. That's what's so puzzling.

Lame Question Alert!  Is there a good tutorial/instrcution on setting up

with what I found.  Much about installing and enabling imap (which happens 
pretty much automagically with most distributions) but very little about 
how to admin and use it.  I'm specifically interested in what it takes to 
use pine on a local machinme to access the folders (pines) on a remote 
computer.  Well heck is it even possible?

Any suggestions?

Two problems, one email:

apparently never made it to the list (I didn't follow-up yesterday because
my email always seems to take a long time hitting the list).  Trying again
this morning and crossing my fingers.

Second problem:

When running CVS 1.11 on RH 7.2, when I issue a 'cvs up' command, my
permissions get changed.

Before:

  -rwxr-xr-x    1 cpoe     cvs          3041 Jun 17 13:00 test_all.pl

After

  -rw-r--r--    1 cpoe     cvs           225 Jun 25 09:03 test_all.pl

I need to chmod them back to use these tests, but my coworkers do not
experience a permission change.  Any ideas?

Yeah, it's possible. It's not even that hard.

What you'll need to do is define a new folder collection. From the 
main pine menu, go to Setup (s) and then to collectionLists (l). 
Choose Add (a) to get to the appropriate menu:

Nickname  :   <-- an arbitrary string like 'home' or 'work'
Server    :   <-- full server name. see help for, e.g., ssl support
Path      :   <-- typically, in relation to $HOME, e.g., mail/
View      :   <-- for limiting folders to be viewed

For integrating SSL support into pine, I've written a howto:

For a more thorough administrative document, O'Reilly has a good book, 
"Managing IMAP":

The trace I am looking at shows ncftp requesting something called
extended passive mode, not "regular" passive mode.  EPSV is described
in rfc2428, and wants to set up a data pipe like a regular non-passive
mode FTP except the listening port is opened on the server side rather
than the client side in a regular non-passive mode FTP.  The client
gets the "229 Entering Extended Passive Mode" and gets a port number
to connect to, tries to connect sends a SYN to port 50447 but never
hears back.  So, either the server is broken for extended passive mode
or there is something on Rich's firewall preventing the connection.

Rich, try a _real_ passive mode, not this _extended_ passive mode.

Just so you know (in case you don't), you won't have to download or find any
files before running apt-get.

I believe for a plain rpm command (such as you gave) that you would need to
download the file or locate it on CD, then run rpm -i filename or something
like that.  (It's been a long time since I did rpm.)  "dpkg" would be the
direct equivalent of the plain rpm command. (As stated by others. I don't
remember what -qa does either.)

Apt-get is a bit more then that... it'll fetch, unpack, install, and
configure it for you (occasionally asking for a little input) as long as you
know the package name.  (Based on the name of the program, not necessarily
version numbers or particular filenames.)  It's closer to Mandrake update
and the Red Hat network in functionality, as far as I can tell.  (Having
never used them.)

There is at least one local ISP to remain nameless that uses 10. net
addresses for some of their core routers.  This makes traceroutes that
transit their network ... Interesting.

Message-ID: <Pine.GHP.4.44.0206261209450.18934-100000@il.ENGR.ORST.EDU>


I was wondering if anyone knows of a mail client that will play nice with
pine.  The current setup is that I use pine at school for IMAP.  I use
procmail and I filter many things into folders and I don't want to lose
any mail.  At home I use a modem.  What I have been doing in the past is
to dial in, then use ssh to connect to the schools server and use pine
from there, meaning that I have to be connected while I write my emails.
What I would like to be able to do is to dial in, synchronize my email at
home, disconnect and read and reply to email at my leisure.  Then
re-synchronize when I'm done.  And when I'm on campus I would still like to
be able to use pine like I always have.

I tried recently to use RMAIL in emacs but I felt violated after it copied
my entire inbox to a file called ~/RMAIL, because the next time I used
pine the mail from my inbox was gone.  And also it screwed up a mime
attachment that I hadn't had a chance to open yet.

So the things I would need:
	1. Deals with my mail offline
	2. It doesn't ruin my inbox
	3. It can find the mail folders that pine uses, on my school
	   account (synchornizes with them)
	4. Compatible with pine
	5. Makes me a better person :)

Any ideas people?  And if this is too far off from a linux topic I
apologize.

Thanks,
Jason

Just a reminder folks.

This Saturday, FREE GEEK is having its first block party / GEEK FAIR. 
This is a "free as in beer" event, but there will be plenty of 
opportunities to make a contribution to the cause.

Events include:

* Music of many styles, all day long.

* Raffle of a AMD 550 Mhz Debian (Woody) system with 7 GB HD, 16 MB 
Voodoo 3 Video Card, DVD player, 17" monitor, etc. ($1.00/ticket).

* Square dancing.

* Silent auction of many items (including t-shirts autographed by 
Richard Stallman).

* Sidewalk sale of many items, including laptops, firewalls, 
sparcstations, a car, and other old and weird stuff.

* PLUG and other organizations will have booths.

This goes from 12:00 noon until 8:00 pm, and FREE GEEK *will* be open 
for receiving donations of used computer equipment.

This is part of an ongoing campaign to raise enough money to expand into 
new classroom facilities and better recycling and receiving facilities.

This is a rain or shine event. Much will take place outside, but there 
will be tents as well as inside activities.

I *think* Gnus has native support for IMAP.  I've never used the IMAP
stuff though.  RMAIL is ancient.  I used VM, another Emacs email
client for a while before I discovered Gnus.  One nice thing about
Gnus is that it integrates USENET and email into one consistent
client.  MIME attachments work fine.

http://banyan.dlut.edu.cn/news/102701/0128.html

and this looks like it made it to the RedHat 7.3 oem kernel (2.4.18-3).

[The drive will boot a dos disk, swapped drive and cable, seek-at-boot works]

Has anyone made this work?

How can I verify that floppy support was indeed compiled into the kernel?

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

Thanks, a misunderstanding on my part.  I thought maybe it had to be a 
special site for network installing.  I'm trying debian.tod.net right now and 
it seems to be working. I was going to try u chicago next.

What server are you using? 

Here is mine. Works fine for me. I also use http.us instead of ftp.us.
It seems to run more smoothly for me.

deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free
deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US stable/non-US main contrib
non-free
deb http://security.debian.org stable/updates main contrib non-free

There is a list of mirrors on the Debian site.

Install postgres, create a database user, create a database under that
user, create a table with the appropriate fields (and a key field).

Do a google search for "practical postgresql" and follow the link to the
O'Reilly book.  The whole thing appears to be online.

Perl DBI.

There are Perl database drivers for both postgresql and csv text files.  
That's right, you can run sql commands against a csv, with perl.  Really
neat.  So just SELECT the data out of one table, in one database (in this
case, a csv file) and INSERT it into another (in this case, the postgres
table).

That's the thumbnail.  Gives you a starting point.  Any deeper gets you
contract rate.  (I'm kidding.)

Heh... how about I read the subject line before I reply?

Anyway, it pretty much all applies except for the book online and the fact
that MySQL isn't a real RDBMS.

If you're using ftp.us.debian.org, then it's probably not the
server... it's probably your network config.

ALT+F2 to get to a console and do an ifconfig -a and route -n and all that
to see if you're really on the net.

Russell,

  That's how ncftp is set. From ~/.ncftp/prefs_v3:

# NcFTP 3 preferences file
# This file is loaded and overwritten each time NcFTP is run.
#
connect-timeout=20
control-timeout=135
logsize=10240
one-time-messages-seen=
pager=/usr/bin/less
passive=on			# This has been set this way for a looong time.
progress-meter=2 (statbar)

  Apparently ncftp is requesting the extended passive mode all by itself.

Thanks,

Rich

If you are into GUI mail clients, Mozilla's mail compenent will do most of 
this (not sure about #5). ;-)

Edit, Mail and Newsgroups Account Settings, Offline & Disk Space. Check 
the "Make the messages in my Inbox available when I am working offline"

I use Mozilla Mail in conjunction w/ pine and haven't had any quirkiness.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206261459040.13608-100000@antares.mpcu.com>

I'll be setting remote console access to a linux host via dial-in modem.  
PPP is not necessary, just a login session for shell account.  I've been 
reading the 'Remote-Serial-Console-HOWTO' as well as the mgettey 
documentation and examples found in 'info mgetty'.

I'd like to ask any list members for any gotchas that they remember when 
they were setting this up.  Issues with inittab?  mgetty.config?

One thing I haven't seen yet is how does mgetty know to tell the modem to 
go off hook and answer the incoming call.  Does this need to be an "AT" 
command sent to the modem when mgetty initializes?

Any info gratefully accepted.

It's pretty straight forward when you do it regularly and about 15 times 
:-)  but from memory (and for a Cyclades multi-port board) the default 
setup is correct.  The only thing to add is the inittab entries.

Here is one of mine for the Cyclades board.

	A0:2345:respawn:/sbin/mgetty -D ttyC0 115200 vt102

Yours will probably be the same except you'll use whatever device your 
modem is connected to instead of ttyC0.

mgetty uses (I'm pretty sure) the default settings for Hayes compatible so 
if you're using something a little-bit-different you will need to make 
entries in /etc/mgetty+sendfax/mgetty.config - which is well commented.  
Otherwise it works automagically.

One downside I discovered when running multiple modems (you're not but it 
is interesting) is mgetty puts the log files in /var/log.  When you have 
20 plus modems and logrotate leaves several weeks worth of OLD logs it can 
get kind of messy in /var/log.  I ended up creating an mg directory and 
sym-linking into that directory.  I should have modified the source code 
(I never found a switch to change the log file directory/name) to place it 
where I wanted but there were others involved that would have freaked when 
they couldn't find the log files where they thought they should have been.


Best,
Rod

  A seg fault occurs when a process tries to write beyond a memory boundary.
It's not a Good Thing.

  I don't recall if there's anything on the OO mail list about this because
my issues are not with the installation. However, you can subscribe to the
users mail list (users at openoffice.org) from their web site. You should also
be able to send a message to users-request at openoffice.org with the word,
'subscribe', in the body of the message.

  Lot's of activity on that list; primarily Microserfs, but some linux
issues, too.

I'm sorry for the previous posting.
My fingers were faster than my brain.

Anyway, I'm arranging a PLUG meeting for July, but it will be
unusual as the first Thursday is on the Fourth of July and I
wasn't able to get a room at PSU for the second Thursday of the
month.

Thus, the July PLUG meeting will be:

                       7:00 PM July 11, 2002
                               at
                       It's a Beautiful Pizza
                         3342 SE Belmont
                         Portland, Oregon

I'm still arranging things with a likely speaker.
I will make an "official" announcement once that is done.

Sorry for the inconsistancies.  However, don't blame me.
Blame Thomas Jefferson.

                                          Sincerely,

Hello Folks,

Just a reminder here that Riverdale School will be hosting a little
party on the 4th. We're just trying to say thanks to PLUG and have some
fun with the software we use. Call it an Open Source show & tell if you
like...

We'll have the Riverdale Lab open from 10:00 to 12:00 noon on the 4th.
The goal is simply to play with software and have fun. It's in the
morning so you can have some Linux fun and still do other traditional
4th of July stuff.

This won't be a clinic but you can still bring software to play with.
We'll provide a few dual Xeon servers for you to play with. Anyone have
some favorite network games?

http://k12ltsp.org/software_freedom.html

Directions:  http://www.riverdale.k12.or.us/direct.html

Using Mozilla to click on a song, it will play for ~20 seconds.   After many 
experiments, I'm wondering if apache is stopping the flow somehow.

twiddling with httpd.conf, I now have

KeepAlive On
KeepAliveTimeout 0

No difference.  (Yes, I restarted the server).  Apparently, I'm barking up 
the wrong tree.  Nothing relevent in the error_log either.

Same behavior using netscape locally on the server as over the net.  Any 
thought?

Part I:

Where do you need to start? If you already have a MySQL user set up, you
can create a database by running the mysql monitor and typing:

mysql> create database mycustomerdb;

If it worked you'll get a response like:

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.06 sec)

Quit the mysql monitor and create a file called customers.sql (or
something) with the following contents:

create table customers
( customerid int unsigned not null auto_increment primary key,
  name char(30) not null,
  address char(40) not null,
  city char(20) not null,
  email char(20) not null
);

Replace the field names above with the ones appropriate for your
comma-delimited data, noting the lack of a comma after the last field.
Leave off the not null part for any field you don't have data for in
your existing file, or any field you won't want to require when you make
additions later on.

Then, assuming you have a user named customerdbuser, and that you've
assigned a password to that user, start the mysql monitor with the
following:

>mysql -u customerdbuser mycustomerdb -p < customers.sql

Then, follow Greg Robillard's directions to load your db.

Cc'ing the mailing list to communicate ultimate resolution.

Not really.  ncftp doesn't do old-fashioned passive mode, apparently,
it does "enhanced passive mode".  Some ftp servers, apparently, have
broken enhanced passive mode support.  Another possibility is that the
network administrators at the server end have firewalled off
connections to the ports where enhanced passive mode servers listen
for data connections.  Your /usr/bin/ftp (probably from the Berkeley
netkit) does old fashioned passive mode and therefore works in that
mode.  And despite what you claimed earlier, /usr/bin/ftp is _not_
doing passive mode by default.  You have to turn it on manually.  I
suspect that your breakage occurred either when you upgraded ncftp
(which got rid of the old passive mode, apparently) or when the server
was upgraded or otherwise modified or perhaps filtered.

BTW, standard ftp _can_ work through an IP_MASQ'd firewall, the
firewall just has to support it.  I've got a 2.4.x kernel doing just
that right now.

So, either: a) ditch ncftp; b) fix it to do regular passive mode; c)
fix your firewall to do normal ftp; or d) just haul out /usr/bin/ftp
when ncftp doesn't work.  I suppose e) would be to complain to the
server's administrators and tell them what is happening.  If you do,
be sure to cite "enhanced passive mode".

  Thanks very much, Russell. I'll contact the author of ncftp about the

My first recommendations is Pacific Solutions on Powell, they will charge you 
a reasonable rate (at least to me) and only do what you ask.

I recently had hardware issues, and I asked them to identify whether it was 
the motherboard, memory, video, since I don't have any testing equipment 
laying around.

$32.00 later they announced it was a bad motherboard, I sent it back to the 
vendor and got it replaced.

It was $32.00 well spent.

My situation exactly, not that I'd know what to do with it if I had it.  But 
the mere thought of trying to figure out where the fault is by trial and 
error makes me tired.  I'll give them a try.

All;

Thanks to all of you who responded to my SQL question. I am warming up to it. Somehting that struck me was the idea that you could create a database definition with a text file; that's great!

It tells me that SQL databases are designed (at least in part) to be open and configurable. This level of control is what attracted me to Linux in the first place several years ago.

Just to follow up on this a little further, it does look like it is a
server side firewall issue.  Our friend "tcptraceroute" tells the
tale.  Try to open a port 21 (ftp) and get this:

Notice the packet never makes it past hop 17 when it is destined for
port 50447.

Also note that I haven't investigated the ncftp situation thoroughly.
The documentation on their website still refers to the old passive
mode, but their new v3.1.3 brags about firewall support (which smells
like EPSV to me).  What version do you have?  The packet capture
clearly showed it using extended passive mode.  I am taking your word
for there being just one knob to turn "passive" off or on.

Just wanted to confirm that I see the same problem here.  

ncftp version		mode		results
3.0.0			active		works
3.0.0			passive		works
3.0.3			active		works
3.0.3			ext passive	hangs

Note that 3.0.0 is running on a rh 6.2 box, and 3.0.3 is on a rh 7.2 box.
Each machine is behind its own floppyfw firewall.  The two firewalls
are similarly configured.

Looking at the hang, I see the server respond to the extended passive
request, but it never responds to the connection setup on the second
port.

Thanks for the heads-up.

I recently brought up Debian 'testing' on an old DEC AlphaStation 200
4/166 that I got from work. It's got a DEC TGA frame buffer that
doesn't work with any monitors I have at home. So I thought that I'd
try installing Debian via the serial port.

With the exception of one large hiccup, everything went really well:

* unplug keyboard so SRM console gets automatically redirected to the 
  first serial port

* plug into the back of the Alpha the three necessary cables: power,
  ethernet (LAN that's masqueraded out through my cable modem), and 
  serial console (null-modem RS-232 connection to ttyS1 on the back of
  my x86 Linux box)

* download and dd two Debian 'testing' installation floppy images for 
  Alpha

* launch 'console' (part of the conserver package) on x86 box and get 
  ready for Alpha spew

* power up Alpha and watch SRM messages via serial console

* boot from the floppy disks and do a base-system installation over
  the Internet via squid running on my x86 box. Very slick. I've only 
  got a 1GB hard drive in the Alpha, and the base installation took 
  only a little more than 100MB.

The only hiccup -- and it fairly major -- was that the configuration 
stuff (based in slang? curses?) didn't always handle keyboard input 
from a serial console with much grace. For the most part, it didn't 
matter.

It did, however, add unreadable characters to my initial root
password, leaving me with a working system -- but I couldn't login to 
it.

I had to boot again from the installation floppies, exit to a shell, 
mount the hard drive's / partition manually, and copy a known good 
crypt()ed password into /etc/passwd.

Once I was able to login as root, I deleted the crypt()ed password
from /etc/passwd and ran /usr/bin/passwd again to get a decent MD5
root password installed into /etc/shadow.

If you can pass parameters to the kernel, there is a much easier way of
doing this, simply pass in "init=/bin/sh" and remember to 1)remount your
/ partition read/write and 2)remount your / partition read-only when
you're finished.

I'll try that sometime. I did try passing 's' to the kernel to boot 
into single-user mode, but I was still prompted for the password.

I've had some trouble with the open office installer lately as well. I'm helping a
non-profit with their computer. I basicly demanded that they use linux as a
condition of my helping them. They also got some free hardware from freegeek with
same strings(my strings, not freegeeks). These are friends of mine so it's
friendly coercion. Anyway The open office 1.0 installer will not work. I've used
open office 1.0 on other computers before with out problems. I'm thinking it has
something to do with the fact that it's an amd k6. I recall going to great lengths
to assure these people that they would have a great office program and be able to
use and create .doc files. This is not turning out to be true. Sun no longer has
star office 5.2 available for download. I'm wondering if anyone has the 5.2
installer lieing around. If you do and feel like helping us out please email me
off list. I've got dsl and could set up an ftp account to make a simple transfer.
Thanks.

	Bright Light, good beer, same good food as before (assuming you like

I still haven't been able to figure out how to get postfix to allow a remote
user to use the server to send email through. How does it allow internal
machines behind it (its also a dhcp server...) to send email through it...
is there somewhere that I am not seeing in the main.cf file to allow
specific IPs to use the server to send email through?

I don't need any special authentication... I think the 'from:' email address
domain would be enough. I looked on a few FAQ sites and just got confused...
any advice or pointers would be appreciated.

Yes, seriously difficult.  Maybe a nice wireless microphone/pa system
would work.

Message-ID: <001901c21e10$c5fe90e0$0b00a8c0@mshome.net>

Hello PLUG members.

My name is Mike Harris, and I am a newbie to Linux.  I am desperate to get
away from MS as soon as I can.  Linux is so different and new, I would like
to ask if anyone would care to mentor me a bit.  I would prefer a quick
method of communication, like phone, chat, in person, whatever.  I have been
playing around with Mandrake, and I do like it.  I currently have a few
computers in my home, recently got satellite high speed internet, and still
have dial up just in case.  My sat is two way.  I would like to set up my
Linux box to use the satellite and then act as the server for my other
machines.  I have the Linux box working with KDE and Gnome, know a little
about getting around in the console or shell.  I can not tell if my network
card is installed or not.  See, really am a newbie.  I bought a Linksys
network card which actually has the Tulipc file on the floppy, but that is
as far as I have gotten.  Don't know what to do next.

I should also say I am a dentist at the federal prison in Sheridan, but
PCing  is my joy.  I am currently taking the Linux System Admin class at
PCC, distant learning, to help me figure all of this out.

Anyone interested?  I would pay for the phone calls or any other agreed upon
expenses.

Do I sound desperate enough,

Mike

Do we want to give this place a try for ALT or should we scout someplace
new?

I've had good luck with recent meetings at the Mississippi (Mississippi
Pizza, maybe?).  They have a big back room that's almost never in use
('cept when there's live music).  I haven't talked to anyone about regular
meetings, though.  It's also not quite as centrally located as some other
places.  I do believe the #4 bus goes right out front, though.

Other than that, I can't think of many places off-hand.  But hopefully it
won't be an issue.

Your looking at having postfix relay email. That's in a file called relay-domains
usually. Make it if it doesn't exist in the postfix config dir. Something like
this in that file:
localhost
192.168.0.2
192.168.0.3

Then mention that file in the trust and relay control section of main.cf. I'm no
postfix expert so I hope someone else answers this more compleatly, but that might
help if no one does.

Looking in /var/log/mail.log or mail.err might give you some hints as to 
WHY postfix isn't allowing your mail through.

Checking these errors, and then looking said errors up on the faq at 
postfix.com/docs.html would probably get you out of the woods quite a 
bit faster.  :)

The first thing I do is always, ALWAYS check my mail log files.  If I'm 
not getting mail, or not able to send, or whatever, just about every 
single time there was something in the log file that tipped me off to 
the problem.

Hi.
I'm having a problem when Macintosh OutLook Express
(*cough*) senbd messages with an attachment.  Some
clients, not all of the ones on the network.  Basically,
the conversation goes like:

>client: (telnet mailserver port 25)
<server: 220 mail.domain.com ESMTP Sendmail
8.12.4/8.12.4; (date)
>client: ehlo [10.10.10.91]
<server: 250 Hello, (username)@(FQDN), pleased to meet
you. 
>client: mail from:macdude at domain.com
<server: 250 2.1.0 macdude at domain.com...Sender OK
>client: rcpt to:mailadmin at domain.com
<server: 250 2.1.0 mailadmin at domain.com... Recipient OK
>client: DATA
<server: 354 Enter mail, end with "." on a line by itself 
>client: ...
<server: ... 

.... at this point, the connection times out.  This
problem is reproducable for these four macs. However, I
can send attachments with the same client, the same
attachment, and everything, from another mac in the
building, and no error.

And to confound things, if I use port 26 and a fake SMTP
server, (fakesmtpd.pl), the problem is the same, but if I
make the macintosh send out via my desktop computer
(using PostFix), it goes great. (IE, same server,
different server software= same problem. Different
server, different server software, no problem.)

I'm logging these errors in /var/log/maillog:

 timeout waiting for input from {FQDN} during message
collect

Any suggestions would be helpful.

Not with _your_ firewall as configured, I don't think.  That's what
dump2.log was telling us when you used /usr/bin/ftp.  /usr/bin/ftp
didn't work until you explicitly turned passive mode on.

Don't be confused: passive mode and extended passive mode work
completely differently.  It was a mistake on the part of ncftp to not
distinguish between them more clearly.

Does it only happen with attachments?  Any attachments, or do they need
to bigger than about 1 Meg (size of all attachments)?  This is a known
Outlook problem, but I've only seen it on the M$ OS.  BTW, it might go
away, ie. fix itself after a while.

Attachments under 100K were reported by the user as being
problematic. I tested with 18K attachments with the same
result. However, my Linux box sends 4MB attachments Just
Fine, and other mac flavors around the building have no
problem.  Thanks for suggesting it :)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206271650220.7933-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  When I look on the linux-on-laptops web site I find both a
Portege-on-laptops mail list and a general mail list. Can anyone suggest
other sources of help?

  After paying Northwest Computer Support to replace the CMOS battery I find
that the date/time still doesn't hold. Also, last evening, while I was using
the notebook under battery power, I received a 'warning' that there was only
49% of power (1:24) left. After seeing this a couple of times, about 5
minutes later I got a warning that there was only 2% (5 minutes) of power
left. This suggests to me that the main battery is worn out after three
years.

  Before spending more money, I want to find out what might need to be done.
Ergo, the mail lists. If folks here have other resource suggestions, please
pass them on to me.

Thanks,

Rich

Can you send without the attachment(s)?  As far as I can tell, there is
no rhyme or reason as to what causes it to not work, except that
attachments are involved and it is an Outlook specific problem.

I ran into a similar problem while working for a small ISP (VERY small) 
but in the opposite direction.  Customers would complain about not being 
able to get their mail.  I'd look at it and find huge attachments - 
graphics, and sometimes cute programs.  I'd go to a non-MS system (Linux) 
and have them down in no time at all.
   Best thing we could determine is it was (and there was some supporting 
evidence) was the MS TCP/IP stack.  Point being check on the TCP/IP stuff 
on the MACs.  Is it the same on the ones that work and the one that 
don't?

Also I didn't read this as carefully as I should have so I not sure if you 
might be having a cabling problem also.  Are the working and non-working 
systems on the same hub/segment?  Ran into a network that had a HUB with 
bad ports.   Same kind of erratic problems.


Best,
Rod

Aye, it's the same OS, and the same version of TCP-IP.
And they can send OK without the attachments; but any
attachment causes them to stop sending in the middle of
the message.

Unfortunately it worked "great" with the old mac mail
software.

Ah.  Now we know why we like non-MS stuff!

Not positive, but I believe it works in similar fashion.  (You just copy it
to a "plugins" directory.)  Substitute konqueror for netscape in the given
path in the instructions, and you should be on the right track.

Though there appears to be some issues with using them together... it's one
of the FAQs here:

http://www.konqueror.org/faq.html#flash 


You could also run mozilla or galeon in KDE (or anything else) just fine, if
you like.  (Or if a particular page crashes konq and you need to see it.)
Plugins install the same way, and I don't know of any problems like that.

Thank goodness for spamassassin, eh?

I'm surprised you even responded.  My spamassassin-marked mail goes
straight into the bit bucket.

I have plans to build an auto-responder which does a hash of the body,
sends a reply basically saying "send the EXACT" message again with this
"special" (hash) value in the subject line and it will get through.  Then
any message with a correct hash in the subject will bypass spamassassin.

... but I have lots of plans for things I don't have time to build.  ;-)

Any recommendations ?

Possibly.  We really don't want another (computer) box, but more of an
appliance.  The thing I found which seems close to what I want is what
SnapGear makes.

I forgot something that's probably important - it's got to work with
the pix 506 we already have installed.

I'm still getting these lines in my logs, even after restarting xinetd:

Jun 27 09:36:42 www xinetd[32481]: execv( /usr/sbin/in.ftpd ) failed: No such 
file or directory (errno = 2)

The RPM is gone, there are no references to it in /etc/xinetd.d. What is this 
execv? I can't find it.

While I don't have any clue as to why you are still getting the errors, I can tell you what execv is.

execv is a C function that creates a new process.  For more information, man 3 exec

That is the reason that you can't find it.

Well, I might suggest the brute-force method for finding it.

# cd /etc
# grep -rl in.ftpd *

that will print out the filename of any file that has that string in it
in /etc

if there are no references found, then 
# /etc/init.d/xinetd stop
# /etc/init.d/xinetd start
*might* fix it.
(rather that restart, which might just HUP xinetd, I'm not sure)

If in.ftpd is refered to somewhere, obviously, you should fix that
reference.

I don't see how these could have anything to do with it.

I'm pretty sure I've stopped and started it, but I'll do that right now.

Thanks. I'll know more when the log gets mailed to me in the morning.

What it sounds like is someone is coming in on port 21 to that computer, and xinetd is trying to spawn the in.ftpd process to accept the connection. 

Does the file /etc/xinetd.d/ftp exist? If so, what does it contain?

Try this Progeny Graphical Installer (PGI) ISO:

http://people.pdxlinux.org/~karlheg/woody-beta-20020619-i386.iso

It's the one I downloaded from progeny, and tested yesterday.  It worked
very well.  I think you'll find it much easier to get a Debian system
installed with this.  It does hardware autodetect, apt, and the whole
nine yards.

This is a net install CD -- You must have Internet access to get it to
work.  It will fit on a mini CD.  If you plan to install more than one
machine, I suggest pulling the packages through a local Squid proxy so
they are only downloaded from the Internet one time.

Note that there still may be problems with the installer asking for
"stable" when what you want is "woody".  When I used it, I specified the
release using the boot command line documented on one of the installer's
boot loader screens.  I asked it for "woody" explicitly.  It should also
work for "sid" (aka "unstable").

$ gdb ./setup

... after it finally prompts, type "run", then when it crashes, type
"where".  Now you can debug it and send them a patch... ;-)

Or, just type "apt-get install openoffice ttf-openoffice".  That's what
I did.  It worked the first time.

I don't doubt that I've got people poking at the FTP port, I had so many hackers 
at it I closed it. I didn't use it enough to keep the port open. Here's what's in 
the xinetd.d directory:

[root at www xinetd.d]# ls
chargen      daytime      echo      linuxconf-web  time
chargen-udp  daytime-udp  echo-udp  rsync          time-udp

What's the difference between the openoffice and ttf-openoffice packages?

ttf-openoffice is just a collection of truetype fonts.  They're the default
fonts for open office.

  I have experience with Northwest Computer Support on SW Nimbus in B'ton.
They're competent and have done well on the two portables I've brought in.
(The second one is still a work in progress, and they're being very
cooperative as we work to find the cause of the problem.) FWIW, it's a 27
mile trip each way for me.

Thanks!

Not having problems myself, but I've been messing around/trying out lots of
debian isos (potato, woody, minimal installs, netinstalls, etc) and will now
add this to my list.

So this is a woody netinstall, with the Progeny installer?  (Ran that
myself, once upon a time.)  Sounds good.  Where on their site did it come
from?  I'm poking around there and not finding it to be obvious.

I'm also wondering how minimal of a setup it'll do by default, without
selecting anything in tasksel or going into dselect.  (I like as blank a
slate as possible, then adding with apt.)  I ran one (LordSutch mini-ISO)
last night that I didn't like so much... I didn't choose anything all but it
still insisted on installing X and a whole bunch of other things I didn't
want.

I suppose I'll see, huh. :)

Message-ID: <20020628120231.A43253@cogit8.org>

I don't think I can do this, but I thought I'd ask anyway...

I've got a virtual set up in Postfix with 4 emails on the RHS.  The
email comes in, and gets sent out to those 4 people (only 1 of which
lives on the same server as Postfix).

It's just an email for me and 3 other friends to use.  Is there any
way to add a Reply-to header so that when each of the 4 people reply
to a message that was sent to this virtual, it automatically sets up
the reply address to go back to the virtual email?

It seems like just adding that header when the email goes out again.
Sounds simple, but seems like it might be hard to do for just that
virtual.

Thanks,
Rob

Thanks Karl.  I installed a new mother board and got my system partially 
installed (bf2.4 woody).  I did encounter some weirdness with dselect, but it 
seems to be working now. I've almost got X working. I wanted ver 4 but got 3 
and I can't get mouse working but at least apt-get  works. What an 
unbelievable program. 

Stay tuned to this list for my questions.

BTW, is Jeme giving his talk(on non package based systems) on July 11?

Subject: [PLUG] Rsync Mini-Mini HOWTO
Message-ID: <20020628121815.A811@coopie.coopnkass.com>

All;

Just for fun, I thought I'd share with you a super mini HOWTO on rsync. I just did this so I thought I'd pass it along. I hope that you find it useful.

Here's the scenario:

Factor 1: My wife is a graphic designer. This means that she has a ton of drive space. I am an admin that can do more with less. This means I have striped SCSI drives that ``get it on,'' but because they are striped, if I lose one, I lose the entire /home filesystem. 

Factor 2: The last time I backed up my computer with the tape drive I smoked my little 180 Watt power supply in my mini-PC. Besides, with drives so cheap, it's definitely easier just to mirror my data on another drive.

Factor 3: I don't want a big hassle but I can't afford to loose important information, either. I want it to be automatic.

Here it goes:

1. Go to a web page that outlines the process so that I don't waste time, life's to short:

  http://sunsite.dk/info/guides/rsync/rsync-mirroring.html 

2. Install rsync. I use Slack-ware. This was simple. Compiling from source does not seem all that difficult, the wifey's machine already had it.

3. Create /etc/rsyncd.conf with the following:


    motd file = /etc/motd
    max connections = 25
    syslog facility = local3

    [cstevens]
        comment = cooper's home directory
        path = /home/cstevens
        read only = no
        list = yes
        hosts allow = 192.168.0.0/24 
        auth users = cstevens
        secrets file = /etc/rsyncd.secrets

4. Create a /etc/rsyncd.secrets file with the following (username:password) *MKE SURE THE FILE IS READABLE ONLY BY ROOT*

    cstevens:password_here

5. Add the following entry to /etc/services (Not a busy sight so no need for daemon mode):

    rsync 873/tcp

6. Tell kitty that she doesn't need to be on the monitor.

7. Add the following entry to /etc/inetd.conf:

    rsync  stream  tcp  nowait   root   /usr/bin/rsync rsyncd --daemon

8. Add the following to /etc/syslog.conf

   local3.info             /var/adm/rsync.log

9. send a -HUP to inetd

   # ps -ef | grep inetd | grep -v grep

   root        86     1  0 10:48 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/inetd

   # kill -HUP 86

10. Test it:

    # rsync localhost::

    cstevens

11. On the client, try it:

    bash-2.05$ rsync -a coopie:/home/cstevens /home

12. Watch Gkrellm's eth0 monitor go nuts.

13. Add the following entry to cstevens's crontab:

   00 23 * * * rsync -a coopie:/home/cstevens /home

There you go! It's that easy. Faster if the cat cooperates.

This request almost sounds like you want linux running your car engine.

I may be way off the mark here, but why would you expressly want Linux
if you want something that is plug and play?

I'm guessing that you want something that has a GUI interface that is
web accessable.


If you drop the requirement that it must run Linux then there are
many...many different possible solutions.
Some that run xBSD, ePOS, CBOS and even Win(Insert two characters). 
Rather than concentrating on the OS it is running, consideration should
be stressed on user impact, and functionality.  For example, how many
passwords should users have to remember?

This is where most "DIY" solutions can pay off in spades.  Having the
capability to authenticate against almost any service is about as easy
as it can get for users.  Imagine reducing your password load to just
one.

There are many different typs of "DIY" vpn solutions.  Some that simply
boot off a cd-rom, load the configuration specific stuff from a floppy
and you are off to the races.  All web enabled, and easy for everyone to
use. The OS is completely on the CD-ROM in READ-ONLY.  Any issues can be
solved with a simple restart.  And the requirement for a hard drive can
go away.


Other than that, I'd suggest praying to the great Google God and search
for simple VPN Solutions.

I have Konqueror using the plugins from my Netscape directory. This 
seems to work pretty well and Flash works fine with Konqueror. I just 
can't seem to get the flash plugin to work with Mozilla. I've tried 
installing it into Mozilla's plugin directory and Mozilla hangs up 
tight when I start it up I have to use the "kill" command it to get it 
to exit.

Even Netscape 4.79 seems to lockup tight with version 5 of flash 
sometimes so I use Konqueror for flash stuff. I also can't seem to get 
any JVM to work with Konqueror since I upgraded to KDE 3.0 and so for 
web stuff that needs Java I use Mozilla.

I should have mentioned that I got my mother board at Pacific Solutions and I 
am really happy with them. I had a little trouble with it, took it in and 
they found the problem (me). God help you if you have problems with laptops. 
Expensive and half the time they can't fix it.

There is an mp3 streaming module for apache.  I think you need to
install that to make it work.  It probably sends the file using chunked
encoding.

I think stuff like this (which is very good, BTW) should be on the PLUG
website, a MINI-HOW-TO page.  This is not the first good one to be
posted, and a nice easy reference would be a good thing.  I would also
like to have some sort of development scheme (to easily incorporate
improvements), nothing elaborate, as these are just MINI.  The main goal
would be to let people get their feet wet with open-source development,
no big projects though, we have SourceForge for that.

Good idea or bad idea?

Subject: [PLUG] ProFTPd error.
Message-ID: <1025296001.23603.21.camel@reepicheep.craigelachie.org>

We have an ProFTPd server running. It works very well for 99 out of 100
customers. Unfortunately, one of our biggest customers has their
connections rejected and we don't know why.

We're not seeing any indications of failure on our end but they get the
following...


======================================
Connected to . 220 ProFTPD 1.2.4 Server (ftp.2rentrak.com)
[208.26.192.25]
User (:(none)): 
331 Password required for xxxx.

230 User xxxx logged in.

ftp> ftp> get /OUT/internal_xref_20020618.xml.gz
Not connected. ftp> get /OUT/internal_20020618.xml.gz
quit

----------------------------------------------------

I attempted to manually issue the FTP commands; the command prompt
screen info follows:

----------------------------------------------------
U:\rentrak_dir>ftp ftp.2rentrak.com
Connected to .
220 ProFTPD 1.2.4 Server (ftp.2rentrak.com) [208.26.192.25]

ftp> bin
200 Type set to I.
ftp> get /OUT/internal_xref_20020618.xml.gz
Connection closed by remote host.
ftp> quit

----------------------------------------------------

I also receive "Connection closed by remote host" when I log in and
issue the "ls" or "dir" commands.
=======================================

We cannot duplicate this problem anywhere, and we believe it is a
problem at our customer, however, it did work at one time, and now it
doesn't.

Any suggestions will be gratefully received.

Get rid of Xfree-3 and get 4.  The packages are there, you just chose the
wrong one at some point.  Fix that and your problems will be more easily
solved.

Waiting.

I don't think so.

I mean, if it's an emergency, I could... but life has really nailed me
down these past two weeks.

Oh and this week I stepped on my glasses and my motherboard caught fire.

By the way, what's a good quality, inexpensive dual PIII motherboard with
a 133mhz fsb and takes 512MB DIMMs?

Tim;

I looked carefully at the FTP session you posted below. I can see that
control commands (port 21 tcp/udp) work fine. Data commands (port 20
tcp/udp) do not. 

You log in and run commands fine, but when it comes down to actual data
transfers (get), it disconnects.

Excerpt from /etc/services:

    ftp-data        20/tcp          # File Transfer [Default Data]
    ftp-data        20/udp          # File Transfer [Default Data]
    ftp             21/tcp          # File Transfer [Control]
    ftp             21/udp          # File Transfer [Control]


Check that you have ports 20 AND 21 open on both sides.

Yup, based on your info, the port should be closed. 

What do you see in /var/log/messages when you restart xinetd? 

What do you see with the command, "netstat -an | grep 21"?

I just diagnosed a problem with Rich Shepard's attempts to ftp from a
state GIS site (see traffic from earlier this week).  The quickest
answer would come from capturing and analysing a tcpdump of the
session.  Do you know what ftp client they are using?

Are you interested in a refurb'd VP6?  I have one waiting out at PC
Heidens for me.  It was under warranty, but I've already replaced it
and have nothing to put it in any more.  You'd actually be doing me a
favor to make sure it works.

Unfortunately they are on an NT box, there's no chance of us getting an
account there, and both the processes they use to grab data from us
result in the same error.

I'm checking on the port thing now though.

You can run the tcpdump from your side too.  The issue that Rich had
related to extended passive mode used by ncftp (and possibly other
clients too).  The traffic in the packet dump would unambiguously show
what was being asked for and received.  Just need to adjust the <host>
in the tcpdump command I gave to match the client IP address.

Well, it was the VP6 that started smoking last night.

It's odd, actually.  I'll tell my motherboard woes and see if this makes
sense to anyone.

I had a dual Celeron 500 system on an A-Bit BP6 with two 15GB drives.  I
had Winders on one drive so I could play Counterstrike at a friend's LAN
party and my usual workstation install on the other drive.  I experienced
intermittent lock-ups, mostly when I was running Netscape or GQView.  
Eventually, I found a web page that showed me that there was a
manufacturing defect on the BP6 where an improperly sized resistor or
capacitor (I forget which) was placed in a crucial position between the
CPUs and when you were loading both CPUs to a point, the thing would
commit some random error.  OK, so I read a how-to on replacing the tiny
component with an appropriately sized one.  My soldering skills are not
what they should be and I fried the board.  Big deal.  I knew the risks.

So I used the Celerons for other projects and picked up a new VP6, a
couple of PIIIs and a gig of RAM.  When I rebuilt the new system, I
ditched the Winders partition and just used the two disks for my
workstation GNU/Linux system.  Therefore, this machine had never run
Winders or Counterstrike.  Well, it ran like a dream.  In time, I moved
the two 15GB disks to my fileserver where they reside in a RAID mirror
housing /home for my network and I put a 40GB disk in the workstation.  It
continued to run like a dream.  Then someone gave me a 6GB disk because I
told them that I didn't play Counterstrike anymore because I didn't run
Winders.  This person REALLY wanted me to play Counterstrike.  So I put in
the 6GB drive and played Counterstrike a few times.  Immediately, I
started getting lock-ups and X crashes when I was booting the GNU/Linux
system.  I took off the 6GB drive (from the secondary controller) and put
on a second 40GB drive I'd acquired in the mean time.  I formatted it
Reiser and used it as /usr/local/public for lopster shares.  Still the
lock-ups continued.

I had no idea what was causing this mess.  I thought it MIGHT be the VP6
and BP6 had similar manufacturing problems.  This whole mess with the
lock-ups on the VP6 started about halfway through Russell Senior's tales
of his VP6 trouble.  I laughed at first, thinking, "My VP6 has been rock
solid for over a year!"  Then all this schnikey came down and I stopped
laughing.

I also theorized that it MIGHT be possible (though I know almost nothing
about hardware) that some kind of anti-SMP register was getting set by
booting the dual proc box into Win98 and my system was going nuts when the
dual CPU load reached some critical level.

I don't know anything.

So last night I pulled out the CPUs and cleaned the thing out with some
canned air and reseated everything (and drained the power supply and all
that) in a half-assed attempt to restore things to their factory state.  I
got everything reseated and hit the power switch.  Power came up, but no
post... no video.  I wait.

Power down, check the connections, see that the CPUs are mounted and
nothing is amiss.  Power on again.  Nothing.  Funny
smell.  SMOKE!  SPARKS!  OH SHIT!  PULL THE CORD!!!

Weeping.  Sorrow.

It doesn't help that I stepped on my spectacles two days earlier and just
found out my unemployment benefits expire next week.

So I'm poor and without the finer things.

I found last week that I had good need for doing some packet analysis
here, too.

Where can I get the best information on how to do this correctly?

Russell, want to do a minicourse, PLUG or ALT talk on the topic?

I'm sure many of us would like to hear about the finer points of TCP/IP
packet analysis.

I don't know about "correctly".  My advice is crank up ethereal and
start poking around.  It is _way_ handy.  Plain-old tcpdump default
output tells you _that_ packets are going back and forth and a little
bit about _what_ is going back and forth, and that is useful.  The
nice thing about ethereal is that it: a) tells you _everything_ that
is going back and forth (i.e., it captures and reports the whole
packet, payload and all); and b) it gives you a nice little packet
decoder interface that lets you expand just the part you want to look
at.  It knows about a lot of different protocols too, not just TCP,
but SMB for example, and a bunch of others, and can help decode them
for you.

Jeme> Russell, want to do a minicourse, PLUG or ALT talk on the topic?

I am no expert, in fact I only saw ethereal work for the first time a
year ago looking over Eric Harrison's shoulder at a PLUG clinic.  He
was debugging (or trying to) some kind of LDAP problem.  Before that I
was just a tcpdump default-output kind of guy.

Jeme> I'm sure many of us would like to hear about the finer points of

The FTP command dialog is all in ASCII.  Ethereal just helps you pull
that out of the packets.  Just knowing a little about the FTP protocol
was enough to diagnose Rich's problem.

This is fairly typical of a firewall that is not properly configured to
allow the type of ftp connection being used.  The problem can be with the
configuration of a firewall at either end of the link (or both ends).  I
don't see anything here indicating if you are using passive or active ftp
for the link, but you could try setting it both ways to see if either one
works, though of course for either to work, the firewalls at both ends
must be configured to specifically allow that mode of ftp to operate.
Passive and active ftp independently require special rules in the
firewall to allow them to work, so the firewalls must be configured
specifically for each protocol used.

Shannon has the problem nailed dead-on.

They are using a braindead FTP client that does not allow passive FTP. (NT
default)

... and ...

They are behind a firewall which does not allow *incoming* (to
them) connections on port 20.

Solution:

Ask them to use an FTP client that supports passive FTP.

This almost sounds like a recurring problem at my old job, where a tech
that no longer worked there had assemble a BUNCH of machines with an
extra stand off mounted to the backplane of the case, but the
motherboard had no corresponding screw hole.  If it didn't short
immediately, it would run until something minor, like plugging something
into the motherboard, would start to cause very strange problems.  I saw
lots of these machines come back, some of them had fire damage, all had
hosed motherboards.  Smoke and sparks means something shorted, make sure
it is not part of the mounting system before you put in a new
motherboard.

Thanks Steve and Shannon, I'm also pretty sure that this is what's been
happening, but I needed some backup before I go to my boss and have him
explain to a *very* large company why their admins are messing things
up.

Abit has had some quality problems with regards to the capacitors used
in their CPU supplies.  It's possible that your board may fall in this
catagory.  Does it look like one or more electrolytic caps have failed?
If so, it may be possible to repair the board.  I managed to repair
my KA7 which had no less than a dozen caps die.

Ahhh, the memories.

I dealt with this by applying a nice set of locking pliers to the
offending standoff and prying it out.

It only took me 2 months of this to realize that they unscrewed.  Whoops.

My expereience has been that companies having this problem often are glad
that someone has come up with the solution for them-- if it's properly
presented.  (I.e. telling them they have a braindead FTP client is
probably not the best place to start.  ;-)

You can bet you're not the only FTP site out there causing them problems
since they put that rule in their firewall.  ;-)

  It's fine if the stand-off is nylon. The metal ones ... well, the "tech"

Subject: [PLUG] ESP Package Manager
Message-ID: <1340840986.1025309315590.JavaMail.root@monkey>

Has anyone here used the Open Source ESP Package Manager?  (http://www.easysw.com/epm/) It inteprets a simple template describing the files to be packaged and translates it into one or more different package formats (RPM, Solaris PKG, Debian dpkg, AIX installp, HP-UX swinstall, etc. etc.)

It looks like it might be a real handy way to package GNU software for installation on these different OSes, allowing me to build everything myself (with custom paths) rather than relying on binary distribution sites.  ;-)

Anyone here used it?  Any major gotchas to watch out for?

Thanks,

I'm a little overloaded to take this on fully at the moment, but I can help
with bits and pieces at a time. :)

1.  Open a console/shell as a regular user

2.  Run "su".  (Temporarily makes you another user.  If you don't tell it
another username, it will assume you mean root.  You'll have to give it the
password, of course.)

3.  Run "ifconfig".  If it can see your card (and the driver is loaded) you
will see an entry that begins with "eth0".  (The first ethernet card.  The
second one would be eth1, and so on.)

4.  You might be able to turn the card on and off by running "ifup eth0" or
"ifdown eth0".  I haven't run Mandrake in a long time however, so it might
be slightly different.  If the card is not configured, these won't really do
anything anyway.

5.  If you don't see any of this anywhere, I think Mandrake has a graphical
network configuration utility.  It should be in your menus somewhere.

My guess is that you won't have to worry about that.  Tulip is pretty
common, and a driver is probably already in there.

<snips>


To use this machine as a network server/gateway you will either need to 

a.  Get a little linksys or netgear router/switch/firewall that does it the
easy way instead(less flexible, tho)
 OR
b.  Turn your linux box into one yourself.

I'm assuming you're wanting to do (b), which means you'll need two network
cards in the machine.  (It isn't a bad idea to have two different types...
tho it can still be done with two of the same.)

You will be setting it up as a gateway router, and probably a NAT firewall.
You'll probably need some help.  I'd work on getting it so you can use it
all by itself on your sat connection first... once that is working start
looking into this more advanced stuff.  (One bite at a time, and it
shouldn't be too much to swallow. :)

Mouse: Maybe check to see if gpm is running, and that /dev/mouse is a

Then cross your fingers, since apparently ncftp currently has an "enhanced
passive" (or whatever) mode, instead of passive, and still might not work.
:)

(The client in question on the other thread was ncftp, too.)

Did anyone ever find out what the deal was with the lack of a pure passive
mode setting in ncftp?

I've had that problem with this part of the install.

For some reason, after the reboot and the base system is installed, it
defaults to stable.  I just edit the sources list by hand when it asks to
choose a server and punch in a testing tree.

Change to testing, run apt-get update, then dist-upgrade.  Then you have
to pick through the packages by hand.

Annoying, but they're beta floppies.

Boy am I glad to hear that.  I was just about ready to give up on D.  
Well, it's doing its thing now. I still find deselect a  little confusing. I 
thought I was telling it, "OK, I accept your recommendations for resolving 
the conflicts, now let me install.", but it wouldn't accept them for some 
reason.  Next time, I'll try flowers or  candy.

In the mean time, while waiting to get X going, I'm surfing with lynx. I may 
never go back.

I mean, the workaround is REALLY easy, but if you don't know about it, you

Walk through everything and see if it says anything about unmeetable
dependencies.  Sometimes a package has a dependency which cannot be met by
any available package.  This situation usually only lasts for a day or
two.

Ah, so! I vaguely remember that.  I assume it's a replacement for dselect. 
I've been playing with it for an hour. We friends now.  By going back and 
forth between selection and looking at what it proposed to do when it 
installed I think I can get it to do what I want.  My problems began because 
the perl-modules package got corrupted and interrupted the smooth flow of 
installation. I got rid of it by apt-get clean.

Not sure what you mean? With a burner you should be able to read, write,
and rewrite. Plus with a regular cd-rom that supports reading CDRWs you
should be able to read them as long as they're burned properly.

the fair.  I will be there.  Unfortunately, I haven't 
asked anyone to help me with this.  So, I'm asking now.
I could use a few people to sit with me for an hour or so;
so if you happen to be at the Geek Fair, ....

  No. I sent an email to Mike Gleason last Thursday but have not yet seen a
reply from him. I plan on following up this weekend.

Subject: [PLUG] CD-RW on Linux
In-Reply-To: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206290317090.21621-100000@Computer>
References: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206290317090.21621-100000@Computer>

It's not a matter of "will Linux do it". It's a matter of "will my CD-ROM do it".

Once the CD-RW is burned, there's not really a format difference between CD-ROM, CD-R and CD-RW. The difference is in the media used to hold the format. 

If the disk works in other computers, but it doesn't work in your Linux box, then I suspect the CD-ROM in your Linux box. 

Otherwise, I'd think it's something to do with how the CD-RW was created. There are some really wild ideas out there about how these things can work, and many of them don't seem follow any normal standards. (Thank you Window XP.)

If you haven't been down there yet, the folks at Free Geek are throwing
quite a party. There's an ice cream vendor, a mime (who will beg for
your ice cream), music, and lots more. They've closed off the street at
their block and have tents set up. Stop by and say hi to David Mandrel,
manning the PLUG table. Buy a tin foil hat from the Linux Fund folks.
Check out the cheap stuff from the Free Geek store.

No, but calling him a mandrill would be like calling him an ape.  Baboons

No reason to objectify the fellow, he's a whole person.

Actually, they _are_ monkeys.  According to, for example:

  <http://www.piopio.school.nz/primates.htm>

baboons and mandrills fall into the Family Cercopithecidae and
Subfamily Cercopithecinae, along with macaques, Savanna monkeys, Green
monkeys, ad nauseum.  All of the apes I know of fall into the Family
Pongidae (chimps, gorillas, and orangutan) or the Family Hylobatidae
(gibbons).  

Not that I know anything about this, just remembered that baboons are
monkeys and went looking for confirmation.

Nope, no connect to http://www.openoffice.org, or http://openoffice.org.

Looks like they're off-line. The name resolves to 64.125.133.202, but no

Message-ID: <3d1e77d2.2d16.0@pcez.com>

Now that I have a job again, I am going to buy a new Thinkpad and dual-boot it
with RH Linux. 

Wanted to check with the Linux community to see what pitfalls this newbie needs
to be mindful of regarding Linux on laptops and dual-booting. I've installed
RH & Mandrake on my 2 home systems with no glitches.

But the Thinkpad -- and I'm not certain which model yet -- it's got all these
optional components and things like the "Ultrabay."  I wonder if installing
Linux is going to be painful as a result.

Their budget machine runs an Intel Celeron -- is there any downside to that
as far as Linux goes?  Does any particular distro have an advantage over the
others in terms of running on Thinkpads?

I'm be using the system for business stuff.

Thanks!

Why does it do that, and is there a way to make it easier to trust the link for the

I am assuming it is due to being a "non-trusted" cert.
Companies like Thawte, Verisign, InstantSSL, etc pay a lot of money to 
have their companies put into the "trusted" list within a browser.

Technically, there is NO difference in the certs other than the above.

 The way it works if you want the big guys to sign your certificate for "web
security" they want you to pay a few thousand dollars. If you have your own
certificate then you can sign that certificate. The traffic is still
encrypted and is just as safe as if the big guys signed the certificate.
 Of course, most web security is a joke since many of these web sites
let that secure data they receive sit on their HD unencrypted and that
is why you always hear about stolen credit cards from web sites in the news.

 I don't think you have to worry about people stealing your email address
from the plug mail list since we already have it when you sent this email.

;)
YMMV

Hey Stuart.

I'm running two Thinkpads (a 570E and a T20) dual-booted using Lilo on
the T20 and Grub on the 570E.  Both worked fine out of the box though
the Savage IX in the T20s on up seem to need XFree86 4.1+ to work right.

The sound chips in them are CS46xx.  I think Alan Cox has support in the
latest 2.2.x kernel but I use 2.4.18, which has the drivers.  ALSA also
works well with these chips.

The latest models also appear to use the Intel EtherExpress Pro 100.  I
think the ones with 802.11b look pretty tasty, but haven't used one.
But the Prism based cards (Orinoco, etc) work great with both so far.

There's a binary only driver for their modems out there.  It's a Lucent
something or other.  Works fine, dialed up several times with it without
problems.

Open/StarOffice has one issue: you need to set an environment variable
(SAL_DO_NOT_USE_INVERT50="true") before you can run it or the installer
(something to do with the X server).  If you don't, the framebuffer
locks up and only a cold reboot will let you use it again.  Took me
forever to find that little gem (but it's in the O/SOffice README.  Go
figure).

As for the windows side, you can fdisk the drive into two or more
partitions and install Windows again with IBM's recovery disk without a
hitch.  Drivers and apps restored, none the wiser.  Lilo and Grub both
get you into Windows fine.

Hope this brain dump helps a little in the decision.  Drop a line if you
need something specific clarified.

Actually, if you think about Dave's role in PLUG, the 2nd definition in

I have RH 7.1 installed on a Thinkpad 390X, which has a 450 MHz Celeron.
Works fine, as far as I've used it; it's not my primary machine.

	Ok.  Now that Jeme and I have moved all of the stuff that I want
to keep out of the apartment, here is a list of the hardware that's
left.  If no one wants it it will be donated to portland waste managment
as I will no longer have the use of a truck after tonight.

9 HP Vectra workstations.  Most have no hard drive.  They make really good
floppyfw boxes.  I'm actually using one for my firewall.  Ok, that's not
exactly true.  Now that i'm on Jemes network (god help me) I dont need
one.

Two mac quadra 605's.  I _think_ netbsd will run on them.  I'm not sure
though.

One stock mac monitor. 14"

1 486 dx with an unknown ammount of ram and drive space.  Currently loaded
with NetBSD 1.4.

3 mac IIx machines again with unknown ammounts of disk and ram.

1 14" Mag monitor.  I used it for a portable head for servers.  It's a
little fuzzy.

Lots of older scsi cards, i think the video capture card (not sure which
chipset) is around here.  There's a voodoo 1 card for a pci mac here as
well.

This is all stuff that I used to use and I would really like to see it go
to a good home.  I just flat refuse to move it all again.

Leave a message at 236-3930 if you want to check the stuff out.  Deadline
is Sunday night.

I run RH 7.3 on a 600E and the only thing that was even a little tricky
was getting the sound working. Other than that, everything pretty much
just works. I am still having a little trouble suspending to disk, but
that is mostly for lack of a real try on my part. I have also heard of
modem issues with the mwave modems IBM uses, but I haven't tried making
it work and there is documentation out there on the issue. 

As for the Ultrabay, I use it with a cd drive, floppy drive, and second
battery; all with no problems.

I use http://www.linux-laptop.net quite a bit if I get in trouble
anywhere, there is some great documentation there. It is nice that there
is plenty of documentation out there on running linux on thinkpads.

Good luck.

They're the corporate bulk order machines.

These, in particular, of vintage 1994 or so.  P75-100, I think.

It's just a desktop PC.  Vectra is what HP called their desktops for a

Actually, I'm pretty sure the Pavillions are the home models and the
Vectras are still the corporate boxes.

*nod*

I've got a small-footprint Vectra on my desk at work. It's a basic
putty-colored box, approx. 13" (w) x 16" (d) x 4" (h).  
Performance-wise, it's indistinguishable from all the other x86 boxes
put out by Dell, etc.

Its prime virtue is that it's really, really quiet. Man, I love not
being able to hear my PC.

I hear that, with the merger, the Vectra is being phased out in favor 
of the Compaq Evo.

The only complication with Ultrabay in my case is that I had to
disable Red Hat's kudzu hardware detection during boot up. It
wanted to go through the whole remove-this-add-that scenario
every  time I booted with a different Ultrabay device.

If anyone can get the 9 vectras to FREE GEEK, we'd love them. It looks 
like version 2 of the FreekBox will first go out on the Vectras.

We have about 80 or so of them (of varying CPU speeds) ready for 
evaluation in our storage. This makes them nice for mass rebuilding, and 
when we can solve the rail problem (need to put CD ROMs in practically 
all of them), we'll probably be testing them, cleaning them, loading 
them with a woody based FreekBox distro and giving them out to our members.

Nine more would be great.


By the way, we'd take all the stuff (need to collect $10 per monitor) 
and all would either be reused or recycled.

A few thousand dollars?! Geotrust has them for $50...
It's typically around $100/year

Appearntly Intel and MS are cooking up a really really bad thing for the
GPL.

Anyone know of any legal loopholes for this?

Or, perhaps more usefully: strace -f -o /tmp/strace-oo-setup setup

Then look at the resulting log in /tmp/strace-oo-setup, the name of
which is, of course, completely arbitrary.

I sit corrected.  Good catch.  Having not seen any Vectras in many moons,
and having seen many Pavilions (in retail outlets), I assumed HP changed the
model name of their desktops.  It did not occur to me that one is their
commercial line and one is their residential line.

It's been many cycles since I worked someplace that used HP desktops, other
than the Kyak Workstations - even that's been a couple of years now.  Come
to think of it, the last time I worked much with Vectra PCs was about the
time of the P75-P90 - the same vintage as the ones Clint is getting rid of.
