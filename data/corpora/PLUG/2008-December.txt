I can tell you from experience that OSU does expire the repositories
eventually. I believe the OP mentioned that the purpose for creating the
local repository was for longevity, which OSU does not provide.

Subject: [PLUG] Bulk Downloads With wget
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0812010626570.24093@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   According to the wget man page it's use is primarily to download web pages
or entire sites. I've used it more for downloading single files from a web
page. What I want to do now is download all files with a specified
extension from a site (specifically, all the upgrade patches to
Slackware-12.0)

   I've read the wget man page and tried some example syntax without the
results I want. All I get is the Atlanta response "404 Not Found". Examples
of what I've tried:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ wget --no-glob http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware-12.0/patches/packages/*.tgz
--06:33:43--

   What syntax should I use? Or, is there a better tool than wget for this
task?

what is "the Atlanta response" ? Is that a reference to something I'm not
familiar with?

Unfortunately, wget only supports the use of wildcards over ftp, not http. I
believe OSU's OSL does make things available via ftp, so you should be able
to do that.

ftp://slackware.osuosl.org/pub/slackware/slackware-12.0/patches/packages/

I don't know why this doesn't work, but it doesn't work for me either. I've
never gotten multiple-file fetching to work over http. I have always found
some other workaround first, like using ftp, or creating lists of what I
want to get, and getting them 1 at a time via a shell loop. This is a bit
more advanced though, so I would suggest you take the easy ftp out while you
have the chance :)

Some may advocate curl, but I am not particularly familiar with that tool.
It may be worth a glance at the man page to see if it will do what you want.
I'm sure it might come in handy some day either way.

   I thought so, too. Sigh. Nope:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ ncftpget ftp://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware-12.0/patches/packages/*.tgz
ncftpget: Could not change directory: server said: Failed to change directory.

   I'll look at curl, wes.

Assuming that's a cut and paste, the path is incorrect.

I tried it with wget, and verified the path.

Michael,

   Aha! I had tried '-r -l1 -A', but that did not work. Perhaps restricting
the recursion to one level was the problem.

   Your syntax is working very well. Thank you very much for the wget lesson!

   That's what was missing. If I remember to put in that directory I can use
ncftpget.

   As it turned out, using wget grabbed every file in every directory when I
wanted only those in the 12.0 patches directory.

   Your information is valuable, Russ. Thank you.

The mirror at Portland State, fedora.cat.pdx.edu (rsync, ftp, http),
does not seem to expire anything that is not expired on the master server.

For older Fedora stuff the master server is archives.fedoraproject.org.
(http, rsync). I've not found a local mirror for this one.

If you want to go way back in time to the pre-Fedora Red Hat releases
they can be found on archive.download.redhat.com. (http, ftp)

For the defunct fedoralegacy project there's a mirror on UofO's server,
limestone.uoregon.edu (http, ftp, rsync). Fedora Legacy had post-EOL
updates for Red Hat 8.0 through Fedora Core 6.

I've never used the logging directive to named.conf, but i have used
the 'trace' command to rndc to log queries, responses, and everything
else under the sun:

rndc trace
find /var -name named.run

i've not experimented with getting trace output to syslogd--i
basically never want that (and my logserver is overloaded enough
anyway).

Message-ID: <b11ea23c0812011238j581ac652s98ecdea74121c141@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Portland,

(I am working in Portland today, so you are the LUG list of choice :) )

When I cut and paste text from Word into vi, I get gremlin characters,
especially with quotes; the single quote gives me a "circumflex-a"
like in "region?s" which should be "region's".

How can I substitute all of these with 's///g'?  I can't figure out
how to ctrl-v it or anything.  Googling "circumflex a vi" just gives
me a bunch of junk.

I am using putty to shell into a Linux machine, if that matters.

Grrr.

Thanks!

This works in vim...

Position the cursor on the offending character and do:

:ascii

to find out its decimal/hex/octal values. Use the decimal value as
follows...

:%s/[<C-V>decimal_value]/replacement_value/g

...where <C-V> is a Ctrl-V. In the example you provided, ...

:%s/[<C-V>146]/'/g

I've not tested this with vanilla vi.

It gets worse, 

Office 2007 just introduced all new foreign characters and defaults
on install to replace text while typing.

We have had no end to bad characters in documents from customers lately.

Sounds like a codepage problem. 

Windows defaults to 8859-X, where X reflects the country. MacOSX
defaults to UTF-16. All Linux machines in my experience default to
UTF-8. 

If your Linux box has OpenOffice.org, KOffice, or Abiword, I recommend
opening (not pasting) in one them as an alternate step. In my
experience their Word import filters are clever enough to recognize the
codepage of the original document and adjust it as necessary. 

I'd also try just pasting into one of the word processor programs, but
use Paste Special (usually Ctrl-Shift-v instead of just Ctrl-v). 

I know zero about vi, but if it has a paste special option, that would
be my first attempt, using the word processor programs as
intermediaries only if necessary.

Others have explained the issue. I would like to suggest one other
workaround: paste into notepad on your windows machine first, then copy
again and paste into vi. This should remove any "special" formatting or
characters in the copied block.

I'm thinking of getting a bluetooth keyboard (and mouse, ideally).
Anybody using one with Linux and *very* happy with it?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0812011533370.24093@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   In versions of Slackware through 12.0 the psmouse module was blacklisted
and not loaded, yet the ps/2 protocol was used in /etc/X11/xorg.conf and the
trackpad worked when X was running.

   Now that I've upgraded to 12.1 I no longer have a cursor that moves in X.
The module, psmouse, is no longer automatically blacklisted. I've futzed
(i.e., trial-and-error) with /etc/modprobe.d/psmouse and the xorg.conf file
but cannot get the cursor to move. No one's responded to my post on
linuxquestions.org (although quite a few have looked at it, tut-tutted, and
moved on).

   If anyone has an idea how to get the mouse working again, please share it
with me.

Thanks,

Rich

Is this a device issue, or a protocol issue?  If the former, you can
test more easily than restarting X by catting the device (as root) and
wiggling the mouse.  You should see a bunch of garbage show up on
screen.

If the latter, then I'd suggest trying ImPS/2. That's been the "just
works" mouse driver on all my machines since.... 2000?

eg:

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Configured Mouse"
        Driver          "mouse"
        Option          "CorePointer"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/input/mice"
        Option          "Protocol"              "ImPS/2"
        Option          "Emulate3Buttons"       "true"
EndSection

Here's the section for my touchpad, just in case that helps:

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Synaptics Touchpad"
        Driver          "synaptics"
        Option          "SendCoreEvents"        "true"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/psaux"
        Option          "Protocol"              "auto-dev"
        Option          "HorizScrollDelta"      "0"

Rogan,

   Well, that certainly trashes the console display. :-) After the garbage
displayed as I moved my hand across the screen, the text was no longer
readable.

   I think it's protocol. The touchpad (and USB mouse) work on the console,
but not when X is running. Here are the appropriate sections of xorg.conf:

Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier "Mouse0"
    Driver "mouse"
    Option "Protocol" "IMPS/2"
    Option "Device" "/dev/psaux"
    Option "Emulate3Buttons"
    Option "Emulate3Timeout" "50"
    Option "AlwaysCore"
    Option "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier "USBMouse0"
    Driver "mouse"
    Option "Protocol" "IMPS/2"
    Option "Device" "/dev/input/mice"
    Option "AlwaysCore"
    Option "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
    Option "Emulate3Buttons"
    Option "Emulate3Timeout" "50"
    #Option "Buttons" "5"
EndSection

Thanks,

Rich

Yes and no.

I have a bluetooth mouse (Razer) and I love it. I use it with my laptop
(Hardy, x86_64). However, about two or three times a week it just quits
working randomly. I have never figured out the trigger. There is
nothing in any log files that I can find. Luckily the laptop is a
Thinkpad which has both a touchpad and a trackpoint. I disabled the
touchpad in the BIOS, but I left the trackpoint working because it is
not really annoying. So when the mouse quits I can just open a terminal
and reconnect -  "sudo hidd --connect 00:0F:F6:6C:6C:DB." Having to
reconnect is worth it because the USB mice I used to use all require a
receiver sticking out of the laptop.

I tried the Intrepid live CD and noted that the bluetooth GUI is
changed. Maybe the code underneath is also. I'm hoping that after I
upgrade my laptop to Intrepid the random disconnects will disappear.
But that has to wait until finals are over.

I have never tried a bluetooth keyboard, but I have read a number of
posts about them on the Ubuntu forums and elsewhere. The big problem is
that they don't work until the OS is loaded. Therefore, you can't use
them if you need to deal with the BIOS, or even edit your Grub boot
options on the fly.

Maybe you've already done this, but look again in your xorg.conf file.
I discovered after upgrading my desktop to Intrepid that the mouse and
keyboard had been moved to HAL and all the entries in the xorg.conf
file had been #-ed out. If yours are now #-ed out you'll have to
configure the mouse elsewhere (but I can't remember where it was).

John,

   No, they're not commented out, but I can always give that a try. The
README files tell me to build a new xorg.conf but provide no guidance on
what to include/exclude.

   IIRC, someone here works for HP's printer group (or did, at any rate).
Perhaps I can get a solution to the non-printing issue that cropped up in
the upgrade on the server/workstation to Slackware-12.0.

   Installed are hplip-1.7.4a-i486-2 and cups-1.3.9-i486-1_slack12.0. The
printer is my venerable, super reliable, HP LaserJet 5 with duplexer and a
JetDirect card so it's a network node. This printer is the default in
/etc/cups/printers.conf. For very strange reasons (never explained to me),
the regular LJ5 is not explicitly supported although variations of it are.

   Since the upgrade, nothing goes to the printer. The jobs appear to be
stuck in /var/spool/cups.

   Any and all suggestions are solicitied.

   Here's more information: running 'lpstat -p -d' shows me

printer laser5_duplex disabled since Mon 01 Dec 2008 11:08:05 AM PST -
         /usr/lib/cups/backend/socket failed

   I just tried another definition (laser5_single) and this caused the socket
to fail, too.

   What do I do to fix a failed socket?

I see this occasionally with my HP printers.  Try this:
   /usr/sbin/cupsenable laser5_duplex

Given that your situation is somewhat different(upgrade v. normal 
operation), no guarantees as to whether this will help.

Galen,

   As root I ran this command and was told 'forbidden.' cupsenable is a link
to accept in the same directory, but I was forbidden to run that as root,
too.

   Permissions on accept are 755 and it's owned by root:root.

   Any insight on why root cannot run that command?

Thanks,

Rich

   Well, the plot thickens (or sickens, depending on one's point of view).
There are three definitions of the LJ5 in /etc/cups/printers.conf: laser5
(generic), laser5_single (simplex printing), and the default laser5_duplex.
Trying to print with either of the latter two fails; lpstat shows a failed
socket.

   _However_, if I print using -Plaser5 (the generic definition), it works!
It works both from the command line ('lpr -P laser5 -l <filename>.ps') and
from within xpdf if I change the printer definition.

   Here's the current /etc/cups/printers.conf (after I hand edited it to
change the stopped state to idle and removed the messages:

# Printer configuration file for CUPS v1.2.11

   This time, while lpstat shows a failed socket the printers.conf file has
not been altered.

   Can anyone enlighten me on what seems to be inexplicable?

   Regardless of enlightenment, I fixed this issue by a very round-about way.

   Since Apple took over CUPS from EasySoftware Products (who apparently
floated to the surface on their back), the web-based admin page is rather
difficult to access. Trying http://localhost:631 doesn't work for me. But,
opening one of the doc pages and using that to navigate to
http://localhost:631/admin does work.

   Under 'manage printers' I cancelled all stuck jobs for laser5_duplex and
laser5_single. Then I used the page button to start each printer and printed
a test page. Starting the printer from the BUI removed the failed socket
message.

   A final test printed a page from within xpdf. It worked.

   So, this makes two down (both with the -11.0 to -12.0 upgrade on my
server/workstation) and one to go (the stuck cursor on my notebook running
-12.1).

   Great insight and ideas on how to fix xorg.conf or otherwise get the
touchpad or external mouse to work on the notebook continues to be
encouraged.

Thanks all!

Rich

Apostrophes are weird though. Word uses a slanted -> ? <- version, and 
this doesn't cross over well onto a *nix system. I end up having to 
search/replace them before pasting.

OK, one other thing just occurred to me, although it is unlikely to be
the source of your problem, but it's a straw to grasp anyway.

After I upgraded my Hardy desktop computer to Intrepid the mouse and
keyboard both failed completely. Nada. After much futzing around, by
sheer coincidence, I discovered that I was running kernel 2.6.24-19.
That's the Hardy kernel. Yeah, the update had hopelessly hosed Grub and
I was booting to Intrepid all right, but with the Hardy kernel. Running
all the Intrepid drivers and stuff on the Hardy kernel is not a good
plan. 

So just to eliminate the possibility, do a "uname -a" to verify that
your kernel is what you think it is.

As for rebuilding xorg.config, there is a command (can't remember it,
but it has "phigh" in it) that will do that automagically for you.
Theoretically, anyway.

I am having difficulty finding the updates to Fedora 9 as there
must be at least 100 or more.

23 4 */2 * * /usr/bin/rsync -avrt  
rsync://fedora.cat.pdx.edu/fedora-enchilada/linux/updates/9/i386/  
--exclude=debug /var/www/html/yum/Fedora/updates/9/i386

is in my crontab, but this doesn't give them to me.

For Fedora 10, I'm downloading tons of updates which seems weird.  Fedora
10 just came out, how many updates are there for it???

I created a base repository using my Fedora 9 DVD and createrepo and it works.
Same for Fedora 10.

The Fedora repository got hacked?  What is the likelihood that this
Fedora 9 system I'm on now has been compromised?

My goal is to update a local yum updates repository via rsync for CentOS 5.2,
Fedora 9, and Fedora 10.

I think you'll find yourself spending a lot of time chasing  
dependencies if you try to mix RPMs from CentOS 5.2, Fedora 9 and  
Fedora 10 on one system. I'd recommend choosing *one* of the three,  
depending on the mission of the system, and sticking with it and not  
mixing in software from other sources without a compelling reason to  
do so.

What do they do when you paste them into Notepad? In my experience, the
"smart" quotes are automagically converted into normal ones.

Depending on where you originally ran this command, in order to retrieve it,
you might try something like pulling up a command prompt, press CTRL-R, and
type "phigh" into it and see if it comes up with anything.

Or, run the "history" command and grep for phigh:

$history | grep -i phigh

In my experience they never have. I just did a quick test which 
confirmed it. My preferred text editor in Windows is TextPad and the 
same thing occurs there. The opening and closing quote marks are the 
same and must be replaced.

Your first problem:
http://fedora.cat.pdx.edu/fedora-enchilada/linux/updates/9/i386/

404 Not Found
________________________________
nginx/0.6.32

You might want to change your URL.  The updates are here:
http://fedora.cat.pdx.edu/linux/updates/9/i386.newkey/

and the Everything repo is here:
http://fedora.cat.pdx.edu/linux/releases/9/Everything/i386/os/Packages/

For one thing the Fedora system did have a compromise, but it was not
totally "hacked".  No packages were effected, but as a precautionary
measure they created new signing keys for all packages for Fedora 8
and 9.
This did not affect Fedora 10 (new keys were already in place before release).
All updates for Fedora 9 should pull from the [arch].newkey repos.

Details here:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Enabling_new_signing_key

This has been all over the Fedora mailing lists, and on the website
for some time now.
Main intrusion announcement:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2008-August/msg00012.html

Also, +1 on not mixing repos for different versions of the same OS,
let alone different OSes.
Pick a version and stick with it.

John,

   Running 2.6.24.5-smp. The only other kernel available is 2.6.18.6 and
that's not what I booted.

   The keyboard works just fine in X (in a virtual console). It's the mouse
protocols or similar that are no longer working correctly.

   Tools such as xorgconfig may not produce useful results, depending on the
ecentricities of the hardware installed.

I've always had pretty good luck getting a system on the air with

# X -configure

which makes "~root/xorg.conf.new" from looking at the hardware and
software. If it had trouble, there will be copious information in
"/var/log/Xorg.0.log". The only things I've had to change in the result
file are that sometimes it can't find the mouse and it usually does not
create a "Modes" line to define the screen sizes.

I did have some laptop touchpad problems recently that might be relevant
here. I am now running openSUSE 11.1 RC1 (2.6.27) on the laptop, but
this also happened with 11.0 (2.6.25). I installed WindowMaker and
brought it up. It worked fine, but when I switched back to Gnome, it
would boot up, see the touchpad for a while, and then the pointer would
freeze wherever it happened to be. The openSUSE "sax2" X configuration
utility would find it and generate a new Xorg.conf correctly, but once I
went back to the desktop, it would freeze again.

There were some messages in Xorg.log.0 saying that it had disabled the
touchpad, although no reason was given. It turned out that if I just did
"X -configure" and used that file, it treated the touchpad as "an
ordinary mouse" and it started working again, so that's how I ran
things. I'm a bit short of troubleshooting time right now, but I plan to
go back to it late next week.

Speaking of openSUSE 11.1, the release is December 18th. I ended up
loading openSUSE 11.1 RC1 on my AMD64 box over the holiday -- I finally
gave up on Gentoo, in particular trying to get a working Gnome 2.24
desktop. I've been running openSUSE on the laptop since 11.0 was released.

   Hoo-boy! I totally overlooked looking at the log since X loaded OK.

   What it tells me is this:

(II) LoadModule: "psmouse"
(WW) Warning, couldn't open module psmouse
(II) UnloadModule: "psmouse"
(EE) Failed to load module "psmouse" (module does not exist, 0)
(II) LoadModule: "mouse"
(II) Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input//mouse_drv.so
(II) Module mouse: vendor="X.Org Foundation"
 	compiled for 1.4.0.90, module version = 1.3.0
 	Module class: X.Org XInput Driver
 	ABI class: X.Org XInput driver, version 2.0

   However, when I run 'lsmod | grep psmouse' I see the module present.

   Does the double slash in the above path mean anything significant?

   So, the log tells me that psmouse is not loaded, but lsmod tells me that
it is. What do I do now, Wes?

Many thanks,

Rich

The double slash shouldn't matter. Do you have psmouse set up in Xorg.conf ?
Sounds like maybe a kernel conflict like Jason mentioned.

Hmm

Ed,

   Wow! Almost there. The results told me that the pointer was detected at
/dev/input/mice, with "auto" as the protocol.

   When I tried to start X using /root/xorg.conf.new the X cursor showed up
and moved with the touchpad, but Xfce did not come up.

   So, now I can replace the options in /etc/X11/xorg.conf or in
/etc/modprobe.d/psmouse and see if those make a difference.

   Much grasses for the key to the solution. What a great lesson you taught
me.

Rich

   Ta-da! Copying /root/xorg.conf.new to /etc/X11/xorg.conf (and making
/etc/modprobe.d/psmouse match the protocol and device options) fixed the
problem. I am truly grateful that you pointed me to a solution that was
totally unknown to me. I've used xorgconf, but it just did not do the trick.

   A microbrew is owed to you by me.

I am currently playing with an ALIX Single Board Computer that will
become my firewall.   A box like this (or as simple as a Linux
reprogrammable router or access point) can be set up to drive an
outbound VPN from the client's LAN to your own site, bypassing the
clien'ts firewall and the ISP's blocked ports.  All the client
would have to do is power the box and plug it into their network. 
The box would reach out to you and provide a tunnel to reach all the
machines on the client's LAN, without reprogramming their firewall.

If the box was two-port, it could sit in between the client's
network and the firewall, and watch traffic as well.  

The ALIX box with trimmings is about $180, and is perhaps overkill
for this task.  You can probably find new WRT54GL access points
for $50, and used ones cheaper.  There are a few dozen models of
wireless access point that can run OpenWRT Linux, and perhaps some
cheaper hardware without the radio (see the openwrt.org site).

I thought about making bootable USB thumb drives that would do this,
but those would depend too much on the hardware they are plugged into.

Message-ID: <6b2e08160812021023k6be5a09ey8e695c555842cd89@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

I have an in depth problem statement that I'll go into below but let me
describe my overall goal in case there's a better way of going about it.

I have a home server that I want to leave on but I need it to spin down disk
and fans when not in use.  This is a system that some days will get a four
hour block of use, while some weekends it will get no use at all.

I've been chasing a combination of shutdown with no activity (as configured
from the ubuntu gui) and wake on lan (wol) using a magic packet.  An end
state where I wake it up with a magic packet when I need to use it and then
it sleeps when it has 20 minutes (or whatever) of inactivity would be great.

So far I can get it to wake on lan from a powered off state if I do the
following:

a) use ethtool to turn on wake on lan 'ethtool -s eth0 wol g'
b) shutdown from the command line 'sudo shutdown -h now'
c) send a magic packet from another machine on the network

If I shutdown from the GUI or sleep from the GUI I cannot wol.

If I sleep using 'acpitool -s' it goes into a sleep that I can wol from, but
when it does come back my video is garbled and the system is unresponsive.

I have tried enabling entries in /proc/acpi/wakeup but it didn't seem to
make a difference so I abondonded that path.

Here is my speculation about what's going on but please take it with a grain
of salt.

I know that sleep and resume scripts match up a set of things to turn
off/store away on the way out with a set of things to turn on/enable/restore
on the way back.  I think that the shutdown and sleep scripts from the GUI
are disabling my network interface and so wol is not finding purchase.  I've
found a shutdown method that does not shut down the nic which is why I can
wol later in that case.  I've found a sleep script that also does not
disable the nic, but at the same time it does not leave the system in a
state of sanity that the resume scripts can rebuild into a working session.

Does anyone have hints, help or other info? Thanks in advance!

I (sadly) have no answers for you, but let me applaud your post: the 
desired outcome, the roadblocks (as you see them), and your 
troubleshooting steps to date were all clearly stated. You must've 
worked in tech support! :-)

I don't remember if I asked this here before, but ...

We're looking for an open source help/request handling web application I 
can deploy to replace the old home-brew system we had in place. My user 
base is IGNORANT of technology, so anything with as many fields as Bugzilla 
will send them screaming (not to mention have them put in bad/wrong info). 
But I do want the ability to comment on tickets and see the trail, reassign 
tickets to other folks, have it send email, et al.

Looking for something potentially I can also add different non-IT help 
queues, such as "HR Requests" and other department-centric requests.

MySQL back end, running on Apache is ideal. Ideas?

I'd like to set up an OpenVPN server for a network with about 5 clients.
Can someone please direct me to some newbie-friendly documentation on this
system?

My preferred Windows text editor (aside from Vim) is notepad++. It
handles the conversion without trouble. So does plain ol' notepad.

It's really not necessary to take this extra step, though - reference my
earlier follow-up on how to do this directly in vim. One more
interesting point - I just tested this with /bin/vi (not vim), and the
paste into vi translates the "smart" quote into a normal one, obviating
the need for further remedies.

it's fairly straight forward.  I the openssl key setup can be
confusing.  I can provide a copy of a working server and client
configuration files if you like.

RT has its foibles like anything else, but in the realm of OSS ticketing
systems its the top of a very shabby group. Stuff like bugzilla and trac are
geared toward software development and use a bunch of jargon that can be
very confusing to end users. RT's function of replying to emails
automatically updating tickets is probably the biggest selling point imo.

Oh thanks.

I will go on a short rant now:

My experience in phrasing questions comes purely from other mailing lists...
the perl list in the late 90s, XML and XSL lists in the early 00's, jquery
lists a year and a half ago... In each case the absolute best and brightest
with the technology swamped with endless waves of newcomers asking the same
questions as the last wave.  It was probably the 10th time I heard someone
saying "XML has a bug where ampersands don't work right"
that I realized "wow these self organizing groups have a weak spot but it's
not anything to do with the technology, there are ciritcal social skills
that carry over fine from one technology to another" of course not that
eloquently.

Then reading ESR's "how to ask a question" paper made perfect sense and gave
me vocab for it (and also something resonably impersonal but also slightly
obnoxious to forward on to egregious cases):

http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

All in all I learned two things:
 - don't go into tech support
 - if you want a smart answer, ask your dumb question as smart as you can

Subject: [PLUG] kernel OOPS -- debugging suggestions?
Message-ID: <c834ec80812021714s12e5e3c6wdd4c59a06b8da0ec@mail.gmail.com>

When I got home and woke up my laptop (a Thinkpad T42p running Debian
unstable,  2.6.26-1-686 smp kernel, but uniproc machine) I found the
stuff below spammed to all my open terminals (gnome-terminals, running
under Enlightenment DR17).  I've never had any logs show up in a
user-space terminal on this install in the past, and poking around in
the logs, I don't see what differentiated these messages from the rest
of the content in the logs.  These messages are not the most recent
entries in kern.log or syslog, which seem to be the only places the
messages were written, although I didn't do an exhaustive search.

Spammy stuff in question is below the line.

This has me a tad concerned, since I've also noticed a decrease in
general stability of this machine over the last 3-4 months.  (I seem
to reboot ~2+ times per week now, when it used to run for months on
end.)

Does anyone have suggestions? (This machine is probably nearing the
end of it's life -- a sad thing indeed -- but I'd like to prolong
things as much as is reasonable.)

Well, it's an extra step in Windows or an extra step in vim either way. 
I'm comfortable in vi, but remembering all the different search and 
replace varieties in vi/m is not easy for me at least.

First off, StringTokenizer has been largely obviated by
String.split(...).  It's generally easier to use split than the
tokenizer.  However, *neither* of those is sufficiently complex to
properly tokenize c++.

The general approach is to use a Lexer which encompasses some sort of
tokenizer that will break the input into tokens according to the
tokenization rules of the language you are parsing, and does some
syntactic analysis of the code.  Any book on compilers that's worth
it's salt will go into great detail about how to build a Lexer, and
the wikipedia page on Lexical analysis is not a shabby place to start.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis

You *might* be able to hack something together with Java's
*Stream*Tokenizer (note the difference from *string* tokenizer), and
it might even work for the cases you need to address.

Subject: [PLUG] BerkeleyTIP Great progress VOIP November - Dec 6 = Improve
	VOIP
Message-ID: <1228305867.13559.1288014345@webmail.messagingengine.com>

We made GREAT progress with the November 1 meeting! :)  I really can't
believe how happy I am about it, & how far we advanced.

We went from in September having no online attendees,
to in October having 1 person remote on IRC, to in
November having 7 people around the US all in a VOIP conference!  It was
_fantastic_!  I was very impressed.  

I'm especially impressed with our online members, who basically took the
info I had in the VOIP data page, & found a conference #, set up a
conference, & got logged in, all while I was taking a short break!  :)

Besides two of us on VOIP in Berkeley, we had Oakland, San Fran, San
Jose, Washington state, & North Carolina.  Plus we had at least two
other person on IRC who didn't have time to get on VOIP.

It was so very enjoyable talking & listening to the guy in North
Carolina - he had a _very_ strong southern accent, & I _rarely_ get to
talk with someone with that accent.  It was so fun knowing I was
listening to someone who was _unmistakeably_ _not_ from the BayArea!

We had a UCB student join us on IRC from one of the dorms - he'd seen
the announcement I sent on the UCB SciPy list.

This is all doubly exciting, because I _still_ didn't even get the
announcements out until less than 24 hours before hand. Think how many
more people might see the announcement in time to join us if I get it
out 1 or two weeks ahead of time!

Good progress is me getting _this_ announcement out about 3 weeks
before the meeting to the BTIP groups.  My goal is to get announcements
to the "outside" mailing lists both this coming weekend (2 weeks) & the
following weekend (1 week ahead).  This will allow many more people to
schedule the December 6 meeting into their schedules.  :)

===================
December 6 Progress Opportunities:

Some things I might be doing:
Getting announcements out for the first (or first advanced) time to
Debian, GNU, FreeBSD, KDE, & maybe Ubuntu, Ekiga & Asterisk & 10
California LUG lists.

Based on discussion that we didn't have a way to see a list of who was
in the VOIP conference room, like in an IRC client, that is a possible
target for the December Programming party.  Maybe we can make some web
ap that can do that?  Or, some Python program which is like a IRC client
for VOIP conference rooms?  Perhaps we can modify the Ekiga sw?

Also, I'll try to notify the Ekiga & Asterisk people about this, in case
they'd like to help out.

Discussion might be about K-Ubuntu 8.10.

There's a new video from Christine Peterson about Open Source
Environment Sensing.  If you know of any new FSW videos, please email me
or the list so I can put them on the BTIPG video page.

Any comments or questions?      Hope to see you in person in Berkeley,
or VOIP conference with you all on Sat Dec 6.  :)

Subject: [PLUG] browser dinosaur cries for help!
Message-ID: <86k5ahpavj.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I am a habitual user of Mozilla's original product, what is now called
SeaMonkey.  It is packaged by Debian as something (for trademark
reasons) called IceApe.  It is the old browser/email/composer/
chatzilla application suite, although for all practical purposes I am
only using the browser component.  I use it because it always worked,
and because everytime I tried Firefox I discovered that Firefox (at
least in its base configuration) lacked the features I had come to
expect, and was unable to easily discover how to replicate them by
using the myriad plugins.  For a long while now (gee, Firefox was
first released in 2002, so like 6 years) I've been able to blithely
carry on about my business.  However, increasingly websites are
breaking on SeaMonkey, while operating on Firefox.  Convincing people
to fix their websites for my increasingly fossilized browser may prove
unfruitful, and anyway, untimely.

So in order to join the 21st century, I am looking for help in
replicating what I see as the useful features of SeaMonkey in modern
Firefox, presumably by finding suitable plugins adrift amongst the sea
of those available.  The Useful Features(tm) are all found in the
SeaMonkey Tools menu:

  Cookie Manager
    Block cookies from this site
    Use default cookie permissions
    Allow session cookies from this site
    Allow cookies from this site
    Manage stored cookies
  Image Manager
    Block images from this site
    Use default permissions
    Allow images from this site
    Manage image permissions
  Popup Manager
    Allow popups from this site
    Manage popups
  Password Manager
    Logout
    Manage passwords

I kinda want all of those conveniently available, not too many clicks
away.  Suggestions?

I've been using IceWeasel (the Debian version of Firefox) which seems 
fine.  I think it has most of what you are looking for.

Well ... up until last week I had both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of
both Firefox and Seamonkey happily co-existing on my machine, and as far
as I know, the only thing Seamonkey *didn't* do was RSS feeds. But
you're right -- I don't think Seamonkey is being *enhanced*, just
maintained.

Maybe you don't get this with IceWeasel, but the standard Firefox has a
place in the Tools menu where you can go "shopping" for plug-ins. By the
way -- you can run the standard branded Firefox on Debian, and you can
build it from source. You just can't re-distribute it. IceWeasel is a
Debian religious gimmick. What does Debian call Thunderbird? IceChicken?
Wait ... I remember ... IceDove. BAH!

Do not all great movements degrade into a racket?

This is what Debian policies try to prevent, and have done well so far.
The Debian folks merely try to preserve what is core to open source:
the ability to freely distribute software without restriction.

It is unfortunate the Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation do not
have similar policies.  They have already started down the path to a
racket.

I don't think seamonkey is so very far out of date.  This whole
browser incompatibility thing has gotten out of hand.  Perhaps the
real answer is to go after these makers of incompatible websites.  But
the internet is a social experiment, which means anything goes.

I for one plan on phasing out HTML in favor of flash.  Not that I am
in love with Adobe, but I am tired of HTML, and HTML is just plain
tired.  Now that we have flex, there's a lot a linux guy can do
without ever opening a flash IDE.  If I weren't in cahoots with a
flash guru, I'd be looking for another plugin, perhaps java.  The open
source world needs a browser plugin for delivering rich media!  I
dream of one that is a lisp image, with lisp code streaming between
server and client.

I know that this has little to do with your post, and in particular
your feature set.  Sorry.

Gentoo has BonEcho, which is a non-branded firefox.  It seems to be
firefox in all but name.  Is this a similar concept to the debian Ice*
packages?

First, a disclaimer - I have long used Firefox, and it is currently
running on Hardy x86_64. So I have 64-bit Firefox, and over the years I
may have added stuff. I don't remember well, because after age 40 stuff
falls out of my head a lot.

Having said that, all of the above seem to be available in Edit >
Preferences. I'm guessing that stuff in there is in the default
installation. Stuff I have added seems to be available under the Tools
menu. If you do need to add something go to Tools > Add-Ons. That opens
a popup window where you can go directly to Firefox's plugin site where
there are so many optional things that it will take a month to scope
them all out. Luckily they have a search button.

Message-ID: <4a0b36aa0812030959w5975e893je6a283c9c593fe0a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am on Ubuntu and when trying to run network-admin or the network manager,
I kept getting seg fault.
I then tried running it via strace, and I got an error saying HAL is not
able to start or not able to
find org.freedesktop.hal.  I tried to update that and it is saying that my
HAL is updated.

Can someone tell me how I can resolve this issue?

thanks

ah... thanks!  I should have been googling for those oops messages
initially... yesterday was a _long_ day, and then getting an oops when
I came home was just depressing.

No solution for the oops listed on the forum, but it certainly
supports the theory that it's ATI-driver related.

Yeah, and away I run screaming again.  In SeaMonkey I can get by-site
specificity with one click and a little mouse dancing.  With Firefox
(out of the box) I have tedious numbers of mouse clicks and a new
window (that then has to be closed) just to get to the *general*
settings, another button leading me to an exceptions window (that then
has to be closed).  That is terrible.  You see, I keep assuming that
someone has made a plugin that puts that kind of sane control back
into a dropdown or something where it's convenient.  And I keep not
finding it.

Am I *really* the only one that misses that?

OpenVPN is in some ways very simple to run, but the concepts it 
expects the local administrator to have mastered -- especially network 
topology and SSL public-key infrastructure -- are difficult to 
encapsulate in a brief HOWTO. Indeed, the OpenVPN HOWTO runs 15,000+ 
words and contains 24 subhead links:

   http://www.openvpn.net/index.php/documentation/howto.html

The easy-rsa scripts that ship with OpenVPN are a good start for 
certificate generation and maintenance, but they're not really a 
substitute for a general understanding of public key infrastructures.

If you're asking for something more specific, I'll try to help, but 
your original request is so broad that it's difficult to know what 
obstacles you're trying to overcome.

You also might want to take a look at a canned system, like Zerina for 
IPCop and Smoothwall, and dissect what it does under the hood.

Yeah ... interestingly enough, though, openSUSE recently changed their
license. They now only put re-distributable software on their release
media. The discussion, if you're interested, is here:

Message-ID: <20081203210301.ess736a2o0wswo40@web.robinson-west.com>

I'm still trying to get a limited C++ to Java translator written in Java.
Lexical analysis seems to be what I need to do.  Does java support using
regular expressions?  I found about StringTokenizer.  Some cases I've thought
of which I might ignore are the following:

int a, b, c;

cout << "foo" << "blah" << ...;

There's no direct conversion for #include <iostream> etcetera...

What about namespaces and using directives???  My sample code won't use them.

I'm going to assume that I won't run into: cin.get or cout.setwidth...  too
complicated.

I might be missing something that should be ignored because I'm used to my
own style of coding.


How should I be dissecting the lines of code into tokens?

As they both use the same rendering engine, I don't why you encounter 
this. I use Seamonkey exclusively and have other browsers installed for 
compatibility testing. I've personally yet to see a site works in a 
default FF that doesn't work in the suite.

SM 2.0 will have Gecko 1.9.1 in it which is what FF3.1 is being built 
with. Development is active, just slow because they're recoding a lot 
for 2.0.

Bugzilla can be customized quite easily.  You can remove a lot of the 
extra field in the templates.  Took me about 1/2 day to figure out how 
to change the templates to get rid of the extra fields.  Bugzilla is 
open source, too.  It is just a bunch of perl scripts.

This is the hardest part of OpenVPN for me.  If the keying
scripts don't work right (and I could not get them to work
for the topologies I wanted, where some machines are both
clients and servers) then the user must learn more than they
might want to about the underlying processes.  What bothers
me most is that I don't know enough to be confident that I
have done key creation correctly and created secure links.

Part of what makes this hard is that we normally think about
moving information, not about restricting it, and the whole
VPN/SSL process is about protecting information from unwanted
release.  In the real world, there are resourceful psychopaths
that want to hurt me for sport, and we design encrypted VPN
tunnels to hide from them.  That is quite unpleasant and
depressing to think about.

Software designers use surprisingly little design automation
- a Software CAD tool that designs and deploys certificate
and keying systems for arbitrary topologies would be an
obvious tool that would hide the complexity of this process
from overworked or part-time sysadmins.  A pretty good
"beta" version of such a tool would be a decent master's
project for a CS student, and might lead to a great job.

I am changing my firewall from an old laptop to an ALIX single
board computer running OpenWRT, and rebuilding my OpenVPN tunnels
around that.  I will probably be generating new certificates and
keys for all the machines that talk to the firewall because of 
that, so this is an opportunity for me to do OpenVPN "right".

Suggested solution - an OpenVPN BOF meeting

It might be useful to arrange a meeting of people with similar
OpenVPN needs and learn to do this together.  I've got Verizon
FIOS connectivity, an offsite server, and other bits and pieces
here at my Beaverton home office that we could use as a meeting
place.  Before I shut down my old system, other folks can look
at config files and log files with me, and see how I've got it
working now.  Perhaps we set up two nearby meeting places, and
create tunnels between them (I might talk my neighbor into it). 
Or somebody else can design some test systems that run across
my internal network.  Or even do it with a couple of VMWare
instances.   Sadly, I don't have the skill to make one of
these internal setups for experimentation and demonstration,
or the time to organize yet another meeting.  

If somebody else volunteers to arrange a time and gather people
and hector them into reading (if not understanding) the OpenVPN
documentation, perhaps we can set something up.  If smart guys
like Paul want to stop by and help, that would be most welcome.

The flow in Bugzilla is more or less what I want. I just expected it to be 
more work to trim than was worth it. Can you share your template changes?

I can point you at a couple off the top of my head I have encountered

SeaMonkey, succeeded first time with Firefox.  Also, DD-WRT (micro

works with Firefox, not with SeaMonkey.  There are others.

Yahoo instant messaging is by now probably the most popular protocol used for that purpose. Yet when I recently attempted to use it on Linux and BSD, I had to change scs.msg.yahoo.com to 66.163.181.173 in order to make it connect. Kopete and Pidgin wouldn't resolve it, though they worked fine on the other IM services. Anyhow, I hope the dotted-quad doesn't change, or that I can find out what the new one is if it does.

Another way to think about it is that life is full of data and 
communications that aren't meant for the public record. Some 
relationships demand more privacy than others, but the slice of my 
life that I want to open to all of humanity is fairly small. Most 
relationships assume some level of privacy.

Relationships conducted via digital media are no different. A VPN 
tunnel is one way to install confidence of all involved in the 
relationship that the expected privacy level will be maintained.

At our office, all of us from the CEO on down work in cubicles. No one 
has a private office. I don't take it as an insult -- or as a sign of 
paranoia -- when some colleagues go to a meeting room for a private 
discussion. They have things to do that don't involve me, and four 
walls and a door are a reasonable tool to ensure privacy.

When my wife and I need to discuss a point of parenting on which we're 
not in full agreement, we do the same sort of thing: go on a walk or 
retire to our bedroom. While the artifacts of that discussion will be 
made plain to our daughters, the discussion itself is more private.

To my mind, a VPN is no different. It's a method -- not much different 
than a conference room or a whispered conversation -- to instill 
confidence among people who need to communicate privately.

Can security be an artifact of paranoia or a symbol that someone has 
no trust in their surroundings? Sure. Need it be? No.

A BOF or a non-Wednesday advanced topics meeting would be cool. I'd be 
happy to help out or even make a presentation.

Subject: [PLUG] serial port virtualization on kvm?
Message-ID: <86hc5jlnoe.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


We have some old DOS software that wants to talk to a real 16550-like
RS232 serial interface in order to program and retrieve data from some
instrumentation.  Problem is, a new laptop doesn't have one of those
anymore.  We've tried the USB-serial converter and the virtual COMM
port, but the old software doesn't want to talk to it.  Does anyone
know if kvm or qemu (or similar) can sufficiently pretend to have a
real hardware serial port to fool the old software?

Thanks!

We use digiport serial devices.  We mainly use them for Unix boxes and  
switches, but it may work for your needs as well.

I am a fan of Roundup: http://roundup.sourceforge.net/  It's pretty
simple by default (it also has the benefit of being able to be run
stand-alone in kind of a demo mode).

As others mentioned, there is also RT, and we use it PSU, but it's only
so likeable: It has very particular dependencies on dozens of Perl
modules, which always drives me up the wall.

It means there is some corruption in the file system. Run 'fsck

Given tonight's agriculture discussion, some of you may find this NY 
Times Magazine article by Michael Pollan of interest.  Michael Pollan 
is the author of "The Omnivore's Dilemma" and "The Botany of Desire", 
among others.  His latest book is "In Defense of Food".  Since this is 
really off topic, I've attempted to send followups to plug-talk.

Hi all,

There was a question at the meeting about GIS software which I would 
love to see discussed on the list.

What open source GIS software is good for casual or one-time users?

Thanks,
Eric

I found it, and ran the command. It then told me to reboot. After restarting
I get a Grub erroe 15 and then it hangs. May have to reinstall Mint.

Eric,

   What do you want to do? Are you working with raster or vector data? Do you
want to draw pretty maps or do spatial analyses heavy with spatial
statistics and map algebra?

   I'm inclined to suggest that there is _no_ GIS software suitable for
casual or one-time use, just as there is no statistical software for such a
use. If you don't understand what's going on and how to use it appropriately
you end up mis-using it and not getting valid results.

   If the need is simple, I can refer you to a colleague of mine whose
exclusive business is developing GIS applications for clients. He could
probably do a one-off analysis more cost effectively than you could.

When Caleb Phillips and I were working on our Unwire PDX Watch report
(the volunteer MetroFi-testing project we did), we used QGIS, and
relied heavily on the friendly people on the associated irc channel
for help.  It has hooks into GRASS.  We weren't doing much analysis,
we mostly just wanted to plot dots (or radii) on top of orthoimagery
to generate maps.  I think the most analytical thing we did with it is
to compute the union of areas within 500 and 1000 feet of a SkyPilot.

Grub Error 15 means it cannot find the files it needs to boot.

I haven't been reading this thread so I may be repeating.

When your computer starts up hit Esc in order to bring up the Grub boot
menu. You should see at least two boot options. Usually there will be a
kernel option and then the same kernel option listed as "Recovery
mode." If you see more than one set, try the lower one. Having upgraded
my laptop numerous times my menu list displays this:

Ubuntu 8.04.1, kernel 2.6.24-21-generic
Ubuntu 8.04.1, kernel 2.6.24-21-generic (recovery mode)
Ubuntu 8.04.1, kernel 2.6.24-19-generic
Ubuntu 8.04.1, kernel 2.6.24-19-generic (recovery mode)
Ubuntu 8.04.1, kernel 2.6.24-18-generic
Ubuntu 8.04.1, kernel 2.6.24-18-generic (recovery mode)
Ubuntu 8.04.1, kernel 2.6.24-16-generic
Ubuntu 8.04.1, kernel 2.6.24-16-generic (recovery mode)
Ubuntu 8.04.1, memtest86+

So if something is wrong with the 2.6.4-21 kernel I can try its
recovery mode, or one of the older kernels below it.

Hopefully you can get one of the kernels in your list to boot. If so
you can then fix whatever is wrong with your current kernel.

hitting Esc does nothing.

The other thing I haven't been able to do is use a live cd to copy the files
to a usb stick. it sees the hdd but all it shows is lost and found and some
other icons all with locks on them.

If I could at least copy her files I can reinstall Mint. But I would like to
solve the Grub problem if possible.

Depending on your uses, you could use SSH as a VPN.  I ran across this
article today, but looks like a fantastic option I may be trying in the near
future:

I went through this a couple of years ago linking residences in Oregon
and California.  Both are running LEAF routers, so I followed the docs
at leaf.sf.net.  LEAF hasn't modified openvpn, merely packaged it, so
the docs should apply wherever you get the package.  They walk you
through the process of creating keys in a pretty step-by-step fashion,
IIRC.

The connection's been great, BTW.  The only hiccup stems from having
dynamic IP addresses.  If an ip address changes and ez-ipupdate fails
for some reason I have to go run it manually.  With that done the vpn
connection comes right back up.

If your bootloader is Grub, then hitting Esc will bring up the Grub
boot menu. If it does not, you are not hitting Esc at the right moment.
You need to hit it right after the BIOS stuff finishes and before the
OS boot screen starts.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0812061739370.5899@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Back from my trip, I upgraded my main server/workstation from
Slackware-12.0 to -12.1 just now. It boots and X starts, but the cursor
doesn't move ... just what happened on the notebook last week.

   Following Ed's Most Excellent Advice, I ran 'X -configure' as root and
then tested it with 'X -configure /root/xorg.conf.new'. No cursor mouvement
with the trackball.

   Next I modified /etc/modprobe.d/psmouse so the options are the same as on
the notebook: protocol=auto and device=/dev/input/mice. Still no joy.

   Looking at /var/log/Xorg.0.log I see that there are no errors reported.
Probably because X fires up just fine. It's only the trackball cursor that's
not playing nice.

   You folks certainly came up with the notebook solution so I hope that you
can help me now. Ideas, please.

Is the track ball a USB device?  Do you have an optical mouse you can
try?  The reason I ask is because the optical mouse will give you an
obvious sort of feedback if it's running (a red light), which means
the usb-hid kernel module is loaded.  lsmod doesn't show any such
driver on my machine, but I believe I built it into the kernel.

I am trying to get HTB going for some of that QoS action on my gentoo
firewall/router.  So I went ahead and tried to install htbinit:

root at ns:~# emerge -v htbinit

[ebuild  N    ] net-misc/htbinit-0.8.5-r1  USE="esfq ipv6" 0 kB

I am using a vanilla kernel, not the gentoo-patched one.

I grepped .config for SCH and HTB.  Nothing.  I've done a bunch of
kernel builds in the last month, and I don't remember seeing any QoS
stuff in menuconfig.  (I do remember seeing stuff in the old 2.4
kernels.)

Do I need some 3rd party kernel patch or something?  I couldn't find
anything on the htbinit sourceforge page.

Never mind (for now).  I found the QoS section of the kernel config.
There's an option specifically for HTB.

Carlos,

   No. It plugs into the DIN mouse hole socket on the rear of the
motherboard.

   Bingo! Even though gpm was running, for some reason the psmouse module was
not loaded. I just loaded it and ... now the cursor works in both console
mode and X Window System.

   This brings up an issue that I'll continue on a new thread.

   Thanks very much. I totally forgot to see if the mouse module was loaded
because I assumed it must be.

   No, I won't. The loadkey and xmodmap commands not working seem to be
related to the psmouse module. Now they work.

I've had my G1 for a few weeks now. Adding a bit to the mention of the lack  
of a way to close applications -- there can be at most six apps open at any  
one time, and when you open a seventh, the least recent one gets closed. I  
haven't had much of a problem with this, but then, I don't use very  
intensive applications.

Google provides a terminal app, but it doesn't really get you much of  
anywhere, as getting root on Android version RC30 and later is (currently)  
not possible. My favourite application so far is the SSH client, ConnectBot  
(http://code.google.com/p/connectbot/). Also, I love having a physical  
QWERTY keyboard on my phone, versus silly on-screen keyboards.

Android is pretty nice, and I can see it going places. The second Android  
phone was announced by an Australian manufacturer last week, I think, for  
US $192.

Subject: [PLUG] "brief" ifconfig?
Message-ID: <20081207084159.GB16789@gate.kl-ic.com>


Does anyone know of a brief version of ifconfig? 
The no arguments behavior, returning network interface status. 
Text, I want to be able to run it from a console. 

As is, an ifconfig on my firewall and vpn termination machine
generates 8 to 10 lines of info per interface, and with 13 real
or virtual interfaces.  That is more than will fit in one screen.

If there is no such program, I will write a Perl wrapper for
ifconfig: one line per interface, with only the most important
information.  It will probably look like:

# ifcb

ifc         encap       HWaddr            inet        rx+tx bytes   errors
--------- - ----- ----------------- --------------- --------------- ------
br-lan    U Enet  00:04:76:11:D3:68    192.168.02.1        15976691      0
br-dmz    U Enet  00:00:86:05:33:4E  91.122.042.131       501921704      4

eth2      U Enet  00:00:86:05:32:3F    192.168.03.1      2422497553    127

tun1      D Unsp  none                 172.231.36.1               0      0
tun2      U Unsp  none                 172.231.06.1        11601166      0
tun3      U Unsp  none                 172.231.28.1      2318814934      0

(74 char wide, no ipv6 for now)

I would probably also add a -l option to make it loop and redraw,
like "top", so I can watch data moving between interfaces.

That will probably take a few hours to write and debug, but it will
make controlling the network easier.  It will be even easier if 
somebody has already done it.

The closest solution of which I'm aware uses /sbin/ip:

   ip -s link

but it still reports six lines per interface, not just one.

While that is not the output I want, it looks easier to parse
into a summary.  If 'ip' is on most systems, I will use it as a
starting point rather than ifconfig.  Thanks for the suggestion!

Oops.  Doesn't give the ip address.

You could let someone else parse it?

You can give "-oneline" param to tell ip report in oneline per interface:

  ip -s -oneline link

However, it just reports everything in one line, it's very long,

Keith is adviced to parse this report.

The 'list" option is interesting - but AFAICS, all it provides
is interface name, mac address, and IP address.  Not the spec,
the byte count, or the error count.  Still, it is the right
idea, and more portable than my cargo cult Perl.


I went ahead and wrote "ifbr" major kludge version 0.1, without
any option processing yet.  It turns out that the platform that
I want to run it on doesn't have Perl (!!).  On the other hand,
I would rather run the command on a different host anyway, so I
will run ifconfig on the target host with ssh, then pipe the
output into this program running on a more powerful machine
that DOES have Perl.   A problem becomes an improvement.

So, one of the options on V0.2 will be specifying the target
host, and others will include version number, help, loop
count and timing.

The Perl isn't that long, so I appended it.  Only tested on
two machines so far.  Note that the byte counts are large, 
so I used bigint .  However, bigints don't work right with
printf "%d", so I used printf "%s" for them;  kludgy but
functional.  Please don't read this so-called code less
than an hour after eating, thanks!

Later versions will be at http://www.keithl.com/ifbr  . 
I could have called it merely "ifb", but the acronym
needs a letter for "retarded".

"ip addr" is another.  Be aware that interfaces can have multiple
ipv4/ipv6 addresses as well.  Another possibility is
/sys/class/net/<iface>/* which has lots of information.

Works fine for me with whatever Firefox is installed by default on my
Hardy x86_64 laptop. Also works fine with Firefox on my Intrepid x86_64
desktop. I just played one video, though.

Subject: [PLUG] Compare folders?
Message-ID: <20081207171852.b2ae592b.johnxj@comcast.net>

For some reason the cp command has let me down, at least when performed
with Nautilus.

I have a laptop where the /home folder contains 14.1 GB consisting of
65,247 items. Using Nautilus I dragged the entire thing to a folder on
my desktop. I have done this many times in the past without problem.
But this time after the copying finished I discovered that the folder
on the desktop contains only 43,650 items, consisting of 7.8 GB. WTF?

So to troubleshoot what is happening I need to figure out which files
from the laptop did not make it to the desktop. Hopefully, then I can
see a pattern which will shed light on what went wrong. I could compare
the folders manually, that is, if I don't mind spending the rest of my
life on the project. 

There must be a simple file compare utility that will work across two
computers connected by NFS. Any suggestions?

Or, better yet, if you just want the problem fixed, use rsync to make
a mirror copy of a directory tree:

rsync -av --delete folder1/ folder2/

Notice the trailing slashes.  These are vitally important in rsync.
You want to copy the contents of folder1 into folder2.  Always use
rsync like this to avoid disaster, especially when using the --delete
switch.  When not specifying --delete, you can get away with copying
folder1 itself to a destination (i.e. leaving off one or both trailing
slashes) without causing major data wiping.

Or, if you don't want to bother with a network mount, use rsync over
ssh:

rsync -e ssh -av --delete folder1/ user at desthost:folder2/

or if the source folder is on the remote host, and the destination is
local:

rsync -e ssh -av --delete user at sourcehost:folder1/ folder2/

I have not tried rsync in over two years. That is because it is far too
complicated for me. I cannot get the syntax correct. Plus it locked up
at random times. Luckily I never lost anything, but I had numerous
close calls. Yes, I know there are front ends for it and scripts
galore, but I don't understand the scripts either. I don't even
understand what the instructions mean. 

However, "copy" is a concept I can handle. I think a backup system I
can understand is better than a backup system I do not understand.

However, I want to steer this discussion far away from whether my
backup strategies are elegant, suitable, correct, or whatever. All I
want to do is get to the bottom of why Nautilus failed to copy a third
of the files. There were no error messages. The progress bar
continuously showed it copying files. The number of files remaining
continually decreased. The time remaining continually decreased until
it got to 0. The MB/sec indicator adjusted occasionally. The progress
bar progressed to the end. 

Thanks muy mucho for the  "diff -r -s" command. It gave me a list of
files that didn't make it. The bad news is that there is no pattern
that I can see. Some are hidden files, but a lot of hidden files and
folders did make it. Some are OOo documents, some are PDF files, some
are log files - in the list of files that didn't make it there is an
example for just about every kind of file on the computer. Also, some
are tiny, some are large, yet files of all sizes made it.

The laptop (source) has 79 GB free and the desktop (destination) has 45
GB free. The total of ~/ on the laptop is only 14.1 GB.

Still scratching my head.

Well, I just discovered that it did not copy the file used by
Virtualbox to hold my Windows 2000 virtual machine. That file is around
7 GB. So that accounts for the vast majority of the missing "files."

However, the question remains why it did not copy the Virtualbox file.
And also why there were about 50 other normal, smaller files it did not
copy.

Making some progress, but still shaking head.

OK, I finally found out what the problem was.

It did copy the Virtualbox folder, including the Windows 2000 vdi file
(6.3 GB). In fact, it reliably copied everything. 

The problem is in Nautilus' Properties utility. When you right click on
a folder and select Properties it gives you the details about the
folder, including the total size. It reported 7.3 GB when, in fact, the
folder contained 14.1 GB. And the reason is that the Properties utility
does not count hidden files. Dumb, eh?

Meantime, while struggling to figure this all out, I discovered
Flyback. Flyback is a python based front end for rsync. It lacks a few
niceties - no progress bar, no final statistics. Also, there seems to
have been no development for the past year. But it runs faster than
copying with Nautilus. And you can exclude folders and file types by
pattern matching. You can do the latter in rsync too, if you can get it
to actually work.

So next is to upgrade to Intrepid. Y'all cross your fingers. :)

Wayne,

   To throw another log on this fire, I had issues with flash-10 on my
Slackware-11.0 host, regardless of firefox version. Turned out to be the
glibc version. As soon as I upgraded to 12.0 (and now it's on 12.1), firefox
no longer tells me I am missing a plugin to view videos.

More:
I found that I could view the video I wanted by stopping the loading of the page 
at  the right time, then clicking on "advanced", then playing it.  Perhaps one 
of the many ads has the fault.  The video played OK.

I am using Firefox version 3.0.3.  In Adept, no flash plugin is shown to be 
installed.  In Firefox, Shockwave Flash 9.0 r48 is shown as installed.  Is 
Shockwave Flash the same as Flash?

I would have to advise against upgrading to intrepid.  I'd back up config
and important files (sounds like you've done that now) and do a fresh
install.  There seems to be less headaches that way.

Yes, shockwave flash is the flash we refer to.  An it is interesting you
consider one of the ads the culprit to the crash.  That IS possible.  I am
so used to having AdBlock and NoScript running I didn't consider that
possibility, but we are seeing more flash ads now as well.

Indeed, a fresh install is less likely to cause headaches for the
installation. But I'd rather fix a broken upgrade than reinstall all
the software. The headaches of reinstalling everything are far worse.

The problem is that I have a lot of software that required all kinds of
fixes to get it working. And I don't know of anyone who keeps a paper
log book of every step they ever took with their computers. If I did it
would be massive. I don't remember all the tweaks. Even configuration
files don't contain everything. I would guess at least several days to
get it all back again.

But I did try the Intrepid live CD and everything worked fine, even the
bluetooth mousie.

I have had zero issues upgrading to Intrepid. Especially if you're on a
supported version for their upgrade already "*Upgrades from 8.04 LTS to 8.10
are fully supported*, of course, and easy to enable. " (
http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading ).

Even if you're not you can get to a supported upgrade platform pretty easily
with

for older releasees..
ii  update-manager-core
1:0.87.30                                 manage release upgrades

then get to a point where going to Intrepid is easy..  and managed by

ii  update-manager-core
1:0.93.34                                            manage release upgrades

It all seemed to be nicely documented for me when I went through the
process.

Backing up your files including your config files before upgrade should be a
given anyway.

This is my experience, too.  I have tried the upgrade process on a 
desktop AMD machine and an AMD laptop with NVidia graphics.  Both were 
complete disasters in the end.  I wiped and started from scratch on both.

   This brings to mind a question I've had for years: why do distribution
upgrades become so FUBARed that folks recommend installing from scratch?

   Since I switched to Slackware (from Red Hat) in September 2003 I've had a
minor hassle during the 10.2->11.0 upgrade because of changes in how tools
were packaged and where they were installed. But the CHANGES_AND_HINTS.TXT
file detailed everything I needed to know ... when I finally read the whole
thing. Similarly, the huge jump from 11.0->12.0 (including changing from BSD
to SysV style init scripts and /etc contents was also very well documented.
But, the latter did take a long time to complete, and I needed expert help
from those more guru'd than I.

   The nVidia graphics chip is a bother. For each of the major distribution
upgrades mentioned above, I had to us my notebook to get the latest driver
version from their web site, then build and install it.

   Regardless, since Red Hat 4.0 I've done upgrades rather than fresh
installations. Yet I read that many folks take the latter route. I'm curious
-- without challenging anyone's views -- why this is.

Rich

I've tried many times to use the Esc to bring up boot menu, but nothing
works.

How do you re-enable grub? The hdd is ok but until I can get grub to work I
can do a thing.

There should be a plain text file: /boot/grub/menu.lst. Before doing
anything else, make a copy for backup purposes. Then open it in your
favorite text editor as root. On Ubuntu that would be "sudo
gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst." You can also open it in a terminal with
"sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst."

You should find a section that says:

## hiddenmenu
# Hides the menu by default (press ESC to see the menu)
hiddenmenu

Comment out the "hiddenmenu" line so it says 

#hiddenmenu

Save the menu.lst file and reboot.

Subject: [PLUG] Strange folders
Message-ID: <20081208115712.c7dc3ab1.johnxj@comcast.net>

My Thinkpad has a CD/DVD drive, which Ubuntu mounts in /media/cdrom. It
works just fine. But while tidying up and such prior to upgrading to
Intrepid I discovered four folders in /media/cdrom (all owned by root):

2007-11-09_10.04.51.241445.Devil7.inc
2007-11-09_10.03.43.558288.Devil7.inc
2007-11-09_09.34.45.021939.Devil7.inc
2007-11-08_21.56.08.043253.Devil7.ful

Each contains the following files:
	excludes (text file containing a list of file types)
	files.tgz
	flist (text file)
	fprops (text file)
	packages (text file)
	ver (text file of four bytes that says "1.4")
	base (text file)

Obviously they were created over a year ago. Why? Anyone know what
these things are doing there?

Rich:
My wife is running Slackware 12.1, but I didn't like a couple things 
about it, so thus far, I sticking with Slackware 12.0. If writing a 
driver or something and I want a recent kernel, I update the kernel.

Some of my clients are not computer people (manufacturing folk - 
sawmills to be exact) and they like to have spare computers, spare disks 
etc. so that should something fail, they can get the mill back up and 
running. I supply them with machines that are equipped with what are 
sometimes called "Mobile Docks" for the disk drives. The Slackware 12.1 
/etc/udev/rules.d/75-network-devices.rules seem determined to make it 
impossible to move a disk to a different NIC without deleting  
/etc/udev/rules.d/75-network-devices.rules  and rebooting.

Have I been behind the door on this?
Is there something in the configuration that you know of where I can do 
away with using udev rules?

With Slackware 12.0, I make the network-devices.rules promiscuous with 
rules  like the following:

KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:06:4f:25:67:b1", NAME="eth0"
KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:06:4f:59:04:34", NAME="eth0"
KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:13:46:e7:81:52", NAME="eth0"
KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:04:bf:90:b7:a2", NAME="eth0"
KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:04:bf:90:b7:a1", NAME="eth0"
KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:a0:cc:69:5c:55", NAME="eth0"
KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:d0:09:e6:23:38", NAME="eth0"
KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:1e:90:fe:9d:ac", NAME="eth0"

No matter which of the above listed machines (NICs) the disk finds 
itself running, the network will run.
This doesn't work on 12.1. Someone probably worked very hard but the 
result takes some of the flexibility out.

Another bitch is the EMACS that ships with 12.1. What a waste. If 
everything else was OK, I probably could remove the EMACS that ships 
with 12.1 and install an older one. For me, that would probably be much 
faster than trying to customize EMACS. I love EMACS, but I need to use 
it, not study it.

While I'm sure there are many reasons that this happens, it is difficult to
avoid because of all the different package revisions that happen and change
over time.  Often formatting and options of config files change, breaking
backward compatibility.  Some locations of things change, kernel modules
don't remain loaded/compiled in, etc.

It isn't just Linux though.  Windows has the same pitfall, but with the
amount of different programs and authors or software, coordinating upgrades
is madness.  So usually it is generally just easier to install fresh when
you know most packages will be using the newest versions, and not have
issues with old config files, dependencies, etc.  Package maintainers cannot
test your exact combination of software, but distribution vendors can test
the combination of software that makes it into their releases.

Message-ID: <20081208205809.GA27846@gate.kl-ic.com>


Denis Heidtmann and I are researching low-power Mini-ITX desktop
systems to replace his somewhat balky machine.  I will probably
be duplicating the solution for my wife's office - her current 
ITX system is hot and unreliable.  There are some Intel Atom
based ITX systems that look interesting - see for example:

http://www.mini-itx.com/store/?c=2

Built in DVI video is needed.  These will be used primarily for
browsing and email and openoffice;  just enough compute power
to play an online video is good enough.  Accomplishing that
with the lowest wall power possible is the goal.  Given the 
modest storage needs, perhaps we can even replace the hard disk
with a CF card, increasing reliability and reducing power further.

Any other suggestions?  

Keith

Hi Keith,

What about VIA's offerings?  I have an older integrated processor / mobo
of theirs and it's quite efficient in my firewall.  Some of their newer
processors are probably sufficient for desktops.

seconded.  i have a 2.5 year old VIA processor (1.2ghz) that i run
caseless and fanless on a 225W power supply.  the power supply is
overkill (i've used it to run 4 ide disks and a dvdrom at one point,
usually only has the two disks connected)--but i already had it laying
around and it's silent.

this was my primary desktop for over 2 years.  it can do fullscreen HD
(720p) videos smoothly, as long as you're not trying to do much else.

I am looking to move some folks off of pop3s onto imap.  

My plan (not fully worked out yet) is to fetch (or move somehow, as
yet undetermined how) from the existing incoming email server to an
imap server on these folks' site (so as to keep their mail archive
nearby, not subject to the vagaries of network reliability).

I am here to ask the group what they like for IMAP servers these
days.  It'll be running on a Debian box.

Thanks in advance.

I'm using Dovecot.  It is extremely easy to configure and hooks into
Postfix very easily.  Lots of documentation on the 'net for configuring
Postfix/Dovecot combinations (especially virtual domains).

I use dovecot as well. Easy to set up with SSL/TLS support and will do 
authentication in a variety of ways: LDAP, PAM, database, text file, 
etc. Dovecot's developers are very diligent when it comes to following 
the RFCs.

Use tr(1), e.g.

Also, in Perl

     tr/SEARCHLIST/REPLACEMENTLIST/
     y/SEARCHLIST/REPLACEMENTLIST/

    ... see the perlop(1) man page for details ..

I'm a fan of dovecot. Used it combined with postfix for a while on some 
smallish servers with 5-25 clients each. It's supposed to scale really 
well, though. It also plugs in nicely with a lot of the other bits and 
pieces (postfix, getmail, ...).

If you wanted to go for more than just IMAP email, the Zimbra server 
provides a lot of nice functionality, albeit at the cost of a license. 
Unsure how hairy the back end is, though. We out-sourced to a Zimbra 
provider, when we switched from pop3, because we just didn't have the time 
to explore deploying and tuning it ourselves when we had to light up a new 
email service right away.

I find that clients (kmail at least) tend to take a few seconds to 
populate e.g. my plug folder (with 22k messages.)  I haven't looked 
into whether this is something the server could help with or a flaw 
inherent to the design of IMAP.

Dec 13th is a Saturday.  Is this correct?

Let me see if I understand what you are asking ... the pattern will be ...
    some string of characters followed by
    an apostrophe followed by
    a character followed by
    at least one space character
... such that if this might be an example ...
    Albert'S house isn'T very new and his last name is O'Malley.
... you would want to convert the S and T to s and t, but the M should 
stay M ... like this ...
    Albert's house isn't very new and his last name is O'Malley.

Is that is correct then?  Any other details to consider?

If you are referring to what we usually call the clinic, it is normally 
held from 1-5 PM each third Sunday, which this month would be the 21st. 
There was some discussion about whether to have one so close to 
Christmas, but I don't recall what was decided.
>   Do we need to bring more equipment than the CPU.
Most of the time, your CPU is all you need. Sometimes it's more 
productive to have your own monitor. I recall one clinic where I did not 
bring my flat screen monitor. The glass monitors available did not 
support the resolution my machine normally expects. That caused some 
difficulties, which were solved for the clinic, but which I had to 
re-solve once I got home. Since my flat screen monitor isn't hard to 
haul, I now take it with me when I go to the clinic. YMMV.

Other things you might need to take would be hardware unique to your 
installation -- a scanner, perhaps.

Free Geek, not New Geek. Unless there is a new organization in town, or
Free Geek changed their name. :)

I am assuming that Scott is referring to the PLUG Clinic, which is held
on the third Sunday of the month at Free Geek, 1741 S.E. 10th Avenue in
Portland, from 1 - 5 pm. 

This month's session will be on December 21. Earlier there was some
discussion of moving it to the 14th, but that idea died. It will be on
the 21st. And the Free Geek Store will be open, the only Sunday of the
year when they are open.

Well it is over. The laptop is now happily running Intrepid. Whew!

I had a couple heart-stoppers. With six minutes left on the progress

the terminal it appeared to be downloading something. Why it didn't
download it when it was downloading all the other new packages I do not
know. Then I noticed the desktop computer (which was downloading some
ISOs) had stalled out. Using the desktop I quickly determined that I
had no DHCP lease. After several minutes of pondering why Comcast would
choose that particular moment to screw me, I walked over and unplugged
the modem. A few moments after I plugged it back in the upgrade
continued normally. Damn!

Then, upon rebooting the progress bar in the splash screen hung for a
very long time in about the middle. I guessed (correctly as I later
discovered) that this was the point where it was trying to get X going.
Sure enough, it booted in Safe Graphics mode. But after poking at
things for a few minutes I got my normal desktop back. A couple more
pokes at things and the bluetooth mouse started working too.

So now I'm off to test all the programs to make sure they are all
working correctly.

The event happening on the 13th at 1pm is the Advanced Linux Class. I don't
know that you need to bring anything for that class, but I am guessing it's
not what you're looking for.

As others have mentioned, what you are probably looking for is the Linux
Clinic, geared towards beginners, which is happening on the 21st at 1pm.

Anyone know of a way to check the ink levels of an Epson printer
connected to print server (Trendnet)?

The escputil command looks promising but I can't figure out what the RAW
device name is for a networked printer or if there even is such a beast.

All the examples of the command use something like /dev/usb/lp0 etc.

This is on a CentOS 5 system also using the rpmforge and epel repositories.

Nope.  You have it down exactly right.  In truth what I was doing was a
kludge, as I'm running a script to organize my music collection.  Here's the
line:
newName="`echo "$i" | sed 's/_/\ /g' | sed 's/  /\ /g' | perl -p -e
's/(\\w+)/\\u\\L$1/g;' | sed 's/[mM]4[aA]/m4a/g' | sed
's/[mM][pP]3/mp3/g'`";

Basically the first sed replaces underscores with spaces, the second I
think(?) escapes space characters, the perl bit looks confusing to me and
I'm really too lazy to figure out exactly what it does.  What I _think_ it
does is capitalize the first letter of every word, which is why I get stuff
like "Fred'S " when I want "Fred's ".  (I'm assuming an apostrophe acts like
a word break or something).  The last two sed parts lowercase stuff in a way
which I am sure could be made more pretty.

Subject: [PLUG] (st_uid=1000)
Message-ID: <20081208195610.ad5d6f98.johnxj@comcast.net>

After upgrading to Intrepid Virtualbox will not launch. From the
command line I get:

jjj at Devil7:~$ virtualbox
VirtualBox: supR3HardenedVerifyDir: Cannot trust the directory
"/usr/lib/virtualbox": not owned by root (st_uid=1000)

After a few moments of puzzlement it suddenly dawned on me - this is a
residual problem from the day when I took ownership of the entire /usr
folder. Hey, I'm the user, right? So they're my files, right? Evidently
the new version of Vitualbox in Intrepid has some security thing going
on that requires the above folder to be owned by root.

So fine, I'll make root the owner of the folder. I did

sudo chown root:root /usr/lib/virtualbox

And the command indeed made root the owner of the folder. But I still
get the same error message as above.

I should add that I have Virtualbox on my desktop as well, and after
upgrading it to Intrepid Virtualbox still works fine. But I did not
take ownership of the /usr folder on the desktop. So that has to be the
source of the problem on the laptop.

Looking at the desktop, the /usr/lib/virtualbox permissions are
rwxr-xr-x, which I think translates to 755. I chmod'd the folder to
that on the laptop, but 755 set it to rwsr-xr-x, and I still get the
same error message when I try to launch Virtualbox. I can't figure out
what the "s" is in there or how to change it to "x." (Set user ID?)
I've googled almost to the end of the internet and Google seems to have
run out of answers. Or maybe Google is just sick of me.

Oh, and I also reinstalled Virtualbox from Synaptic, but no joy.

So the requirement is actually to ...
    replace each underscore with a space
    replace each space with an escaped space
    Capitalize the first letter of each word
... yes so far?
Questions ...
    Why escape spaces?
    Do you want to capitalize the first letter of articles as well (a, 
an, the, stuff like that)? - or does that matter?

having written the same script lo these many years ago, i can only
advise heartily against spaces in filenames.  that took hours to
convince me that i would never be able to successfully handle the
mishmash of filenames i'd collected over the years, some of which had
' and " in the filename to screw up my \\\\quoting.

good luck nonetheless =)

Message-ID: <20081209042802.GA3864@gate.kl-ic.com>


I never noticed before, but the ifconfig fields RXbytes and TXbytes
wrap to the word size of the machine.  That is, for a 32 bit machine
they max out at 4,294,967,295 (2^32-1) then start counting at zero
again.  For a 64 bit machine, they go much larger (my 64 bit compute
server, which has been up for 260 days, has transmitted 31.5 GiB so
far).

This is the equal to the values stored in:

/sys/class/net/*/statistics/tx_bytes and ... /rx_bytes

... which wrap the same way.

So, I may change my ifbr script to count packets rather than
bytes.  Those will still measure data movement, but they will
wrap much less often.

Interestingly, "ip -s link" wraps at 32 bits for both 32 bit and
64 bit machines.  How very "special".  Not.

This behavior was observed with a 2.6.18 kernel (RHEL5) and a
2.6.24 kernel (Ubuntu 8.04 Heron).  I guess it's a "feature".

John you need 0755 the setuid bit is set. This 0755 will remove it.

I thought of more google search terms, and learned that this has
been an issue for a while.  See:

http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/2/18/169

I suppose they are silently hoping for this to go away as 64 bit
machines replace the 32 bit ones.  A 32 bit machine, connected to
10 gigabit ethernet, is going to wrap the counter about 10 times
per minute ...

I had already set it to 755, but still got the error message. While
puzzling over it I suddenly noticed that there was a folder in
the /usr/lib/virtualbox folder that was owned by me. Further checking
revealed that it is a new folder added by the upgrade to Virtualbox
2.0.4. I chowned it to root, and voil?!

Virtualbox is now running same as before - my W2000 installation is
exactly as it was. 

Thanks for the response. It made me look at the folder one more time. :)

Good! Although 0755 or say 1755 are different from just 755 :)

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0812090714040.1607@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Since the distribution upgrade of my server/workstation I can no longer
access SQL-Ledger ... a critical issue I need to fix right away.

   When I enter the URL (http://localhost/sql-ledger/login.pl) in a firefox
tab I see this:

Not Found
The requested URL /sql-ledger/login.pl was not found on this server.

   There are no entries more recent than Nov. 29th in
/var/log/apache/access_log and /var/log/apache/error_log.

   I have both /etc/httpd/ and /etc/apache/ directories containing
httpd.conf, and other files. I can provide a list of files and their
last-modified/accessed dates if that helps.

   I don't know where to look for the cause of the problem, and for some
reason my request to subscribe to the SQL-Ledger mail list has not been
acted upon, It's apparently not automatic but requires human approval.

   Help from you admin gurus will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Rich

  Forgot to mention that the apache package was replaced by the httpd package
in 12.0. What this means for the contents of /etc/apache/ and /etc/httpd/ I
don't know ... nothing in the CHANGES_AND_HINTS or UPGRADE files say
anything about them.

   In ~/.bash_profile on both my server/workstation and notebook I have a
line at the end that reads:

loadkeys ~/.keymap

   On the big machine this has always worked as intended, so the caps lock
and ctrl keys are swapped back to their proper position.

   However, on the notebook this line is not executed. The errors are visible
when I run it manually from a console:

Loading .keymap
Keymap 0: Permission denied
Keymap 1: Permission denied
Keymap 2: Permission denied
KDSKBENT: Operation not permitted
loadkeys: could not deallocate keymap 3

   I have spent months searching with Google and rummaging around the system
trying to find what's different between the two machines. I've not yet found
any difference. Can't find the keymap files to check permissions, and I
don't know why they'd be different in any case.

   Please point me to a solution to this problem.

You misread the question - Eitan wants to replace FRED'S with
FRED's, which is more grammatically correct (me, I would prefer
Fred's ).   A lot would depend on context, which Eitan did not
give.  Is this an isolated word, or correcting words as part of
text, or what?  For example, Fixing "FRED'S NAP'STER FILE" 
will be interesting if the second S is not supposted to get
lower cased;  otherwise, just replace all instances of "'S"
with "'s".    If text, what about end-of-line issues?  What
about non-Roman characters?  What matters here?
 
Sometimes, the best way to get started on a problem like this
is to produce a few examples and expected outputs, and "design
to the test".  A clear set of tests may result in simpler code.

I think the permission of interest is:  `ls -l /dev/console`

But you didn't say whether you were running as root.

Ok, so here's a few examples... (from my music collection)

Guns N' Roses
FAT FREDDY'S DROP
black_rebel_motorcycle_club

The end results SHOULD be like so:
Guns N' Roses
Fat Freddy's Drop (note the 's is not capitalized)
Black Rebel Motorcycle Club (underscores converted to spaces)

Basically capitalize every first letter of every word, convert underscores
to spaces, (these are folder names by the way,) and NOT capitalize letters
after an apostrophe and before a space.  That should take care of most
cases.  For non-roman chars I may have to look into that.  I have a few
folders with those in the text.  The reason for this is to have consistent
naming and format of all folders.

Eric,

   Good start, I think. To answer your second question first, when I run as
root, 'loadkeys ~/.keymap' runs. When I run as a user, it does not.

   On both hosts (this works on the big box), /dev/console has perms of
crw------- and is owned by root.tty. On both hosts, /etc/groups has root and
rshepard belonging to tty.

   So I see no differences between the two hosts, yet logging in as a user on
the server/workstation runs loadkeys while logging in as a user on the
notebook doesn't.

   Grr-r-r!

Thanks,

Rich

Oops - I made an incorrect assumption ... assuming that the file name 
would have underscores instead of spaces (as in the 
"black_rebel_motorcycle_club" example) this would work (see below) ... 
but it won't work with spaces (i.e., "FAT FREDDY'S DROP")
But you could use 'ls -1' to make a text file of names, (one name per 
line/record) and then feed those into the loop one line at a time - does 
that help?

Please disregard the last reply.  I looked at my Kubuntu machine.

Looks like you'll have to use the Custom setting and set it up from there.

Drew,

   Not much insight from that:

[root at salmo ~]# /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd status
Usage: /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd {start|stop|restart|graceful|graceful-stop}

   It doesn't say that it's running, but `ps ax | grep httpd' shows:

[root at salmo ~]# ps ax | grep httpd
16837 pts/1    R+     0:00 grep httpd

23880 ?        S      0:00 /usr/sbin/httpd -k start

To my naive eye, this looks like the daemon is running.

Thanks,

Rich

Wow...  Well all I really need is something that matches
"[apostrophe][letter][space]" and lowercases that letter in a string.  I
assume this can be done with sed or some other tool.  I'll tack it on to the
end of what I have so far, which does most of what I need already.

I must be retarded ;-) I could have sworn there was a status option in there
some where, maybe apache 1.x ... anyways.

So it is running as you've shown. I'm wondering if your httpd.conf has been
over written so the pathing is broken. Where physically on the system does
/sql-ledger/ live? Check /etc/httpd/$conf/httpd.conf (I believe this is
where it should be, I use my own packages, not Pat's, so I'm not super sure)
and see the paths are correct and you have the cgi mapping for sql-ledger in
there, maybe the old config is named httpd.conf.bak{old} which should have
happened during the upgrade.

Do you have some type of relay server set up? It looks like some sort of
relay error as near as I can tell.

Here's what I've been doing.  It's lower level, but firefox specific.  The
location of the  Prefered Applications control
keeps wandering around, but the firefox control seems to be stable.
http://kb.mozillazine.org/Default_mail_client

See heading 'Setting email client for Firefox in Linux' near the bottom.

At least on Red Hat-ish systems, 'status' is provided by a helper

Sorry - forgot to mention that if you wanted to go the text file route, 
you would want to remove the '-F\_' from the gawk statement
('gawk -F\_ {' becomes 'gawk {')
and move the first sed statement to before the gawk - hope that helps

The GUI did not provide a means to get to the directory where 
thunderbird lives, nor is there a text box in which to type in 
thunderbird %s.

Their instructions aren't complete enough to cover Ubuntu. However, it 
gave me enough to work with to go find the right place to make the 
change. Mozillazine's instructions say:

Go to "Applications -> Desktop Preferences -> Advanced -> Preferred 
Applications."

In Ubuntu Hardy, you have to:

Go to "System -> Preferences -> Preferred Applications. "

The first tab on the window is Internet, with  Web Browser and Mail 
Reader as the two  applications to set. Thunderbird is one of the two 
choices available for Mail Reader on my system, and thunderbird %s is 
listed in the "command" text box.

After changing that selection from Evolution to Thunderbird I now get a 
Thunderbird composition window when I click on a mailto link.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.

Drew,

   Getting much closer, thank you.

   I modified /etc/httpd/httpd.conf to include the sql-ledger, system name,
and admin name from /etc/apache/httpd.conf. Now it starts. However, ...

   When I try to log in as a user (http://localhost/sql-ledger/login.pl) and
press [Enter] after typing my username and password I see:

Error!
users/rshepard.conf : Permission denied

   Hmm-m-m. I've no idea where that might be controlled, so I try logging
into (http://localhost/sql-ledger/admin.pl) only to see:

Error!
No Database Drivers available!

   So there's more that needs to be ported from the old /etc/apache/ to the
new /etc/httpd/.

   I added to /etc/httpd/httpd.conf the line 'Include
/etc/httpd/sql-ledger-httpd.conf', and that file is in the proper directory.
Among other things it points to where sql-ledger lives:

Alias /sql-ledger/ /usr/local/sql-ledger/
<Directory /usr/local/sql-ledger>
   AllowOverride All
   AddHandler cgi-script .pl
   Options ExecCGI Includes FollowSymlinks
   Order Allow,Deny
   Allow from All
</Directory>

<Directory /usr/local/sql-ledger/users>
   Order Deny,Allow
   Deny from All
</Directory>

and the directory, /usr/local/sql-ledger/users, does have an rshepard.conf
file. The perms on /usr/local/sql-ledger are 755 and it's owned by
nobody.nobody; perms on /usr/local/sql-ledger/users are 711 (also
nobody.nobody). Do I need read permissions to get to the rshepard.conf file?
The rshepard.conf file was created/modified/accessed 11/28 of this year and
has permissions of 644 (owned by nobody.nobody).

   Anything strike you as wrong here?

Many thanks,

Rich

Drew,

   No, and I've not changed any postfix config files since it last worked.

   I did get a message from mailman at sourceforge.net that I was already
subscribed when I tried to subscribe. So some messages are accepted from
there.

   It must be the weather. Now my message to the SL mail list comes back to
me, along with another message posted to the list by someone else. In other
words, my subscription seems to be working again.

   This is turning into a three-drinks-after-work day.

Is loadkeys setuid on the workstation?

  ls -l $(which loadkeys)

If so, I would say adding group rw permissions to /dev/console would be 
the more appropriate way to grant that privilege.

The HVR-850 works (only as ATSC, but the analog support won't matter in 
a couple months anyway.)  The instructions on the linuxtv wiki are not 
very good.  (The dvbscan program is currently broken, so after messing 
with firmware, I didn't know the tuner was working until I tried 
the 'scan' program.)  The firmware you need is:

  http://www.steventoth.net/linux/xc5000/

At least, if you have kernel 2.6.26 and the xc5000 gets automatically 
loaded.  There seems to have been some talk about the HVR-850 having 
various innards.

Eric,

   What's odd is that loadkeys loads for me as a user on the workstation.
It's the notebook that's being recalcitrant.

   /usr/bin/loadkeys is a link to /bin/loadkeys. The latter has 755
permissions.

   I can try setting it to 775 and see if that makes a difference ... and we
have a winner by setting /bin/loadkeys to 755! So, 755 works on the
workstation, but the notebook needs 775. Wow! That's non-intuitive.

Many thanks,

Rich

That sounds wrong.  You need write permission on a binary?  It is not a 
binary?  Does `file $(which loadkeys)` say anything about it being a 
script?  I can imagine scenarios where write permission on a script (or 
even a binary) would make a difference, but most of those imaginings 
are the stuff nightmares are made of.

   Nope:

[root at salmo ~]# file /bin/loadkeys bin/loadkeys: ELF 32-bit LSB executable,
Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs),
stripped

   Well, why would loadkeys work on the server/workstation with
Slackware-12.1 (and earlier releases), but it wouldn't work on the Sony Vaio
notebook since I upgraded to Slackware-11.0. Go figure. None of this makes
any sense, but if loadkeys will work for me logging in as a user by having
group write permissions set, who am I to argue with it?

Thanks again for the pointer to a solution,

Rich

What user/group is Apache running as? It seems that perhaps Apache is not
running as nobody.nobody so the permissions are too restrictive to allow
access to rshepard.conf

You could change the user/group to nobody.nobody in the httpd.conf and
restart Apache so that you wouldn't have to change anything else.

Drew,

   Up to -12.0 or -12.1 (I forget in which version it changed), the package
was called apache, the configuration file was /etc/apache/httpd.conf, and
user.group was nobody.nobody. Now, the package is called httpd, the
configuration file is /etc/httpd/httpd.conf, and user.group is
apache.apache. In addition, there is now a /srv/httpd which is a soft link
to /var/www.

   I'll give this a try, wait one ... nope:

Internal Server Error

The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable
to complete your request.

Please contact the server administrator, rshepard at appl-ecosys.com and inform
them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that
may have caused the error.

More information about this error may be available in the server error log.

   Keep those ideas coming, though!

Thanks,

Rich

Is it strictly necessary for the gateway of a class C subnet to have
an address ending in .1, like 192.168.16.1?  I am about to install a
router into an existing firewall-less network, and the guy who
"administers" this network is telling me to assign the address
192.168.16.5 to the new router.  I want to tell him he is full of it,
but I want to double-check my facts first, just in case he is a genius
(he's either that, or something else).

No.  AFAIK, there's nothing magic about a router's IP address.  It's 
just common to use the lowest(or highest) available address.

nope, you can have any gateway you like.  the .1 is merely convention.
 i've worked in an organization with 100k hosts whose local standard
was .250.

Carlos,

   Nope. Our router has had the local IP address of 192.168.55.4 for ... 9
years? Something like that time.

Did you chown the SQL-Ledger directory to apache.apache since it's currently
owned by nobody.nobody and restart Apache?

Give that a shot when you get a chance.

.1 or .254 are the usual standard but it doesn't really matter.

Subject: [PLUG] Now To Fix .Xmodmap
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0812091851250.18913@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I really appreciate the guidance in fixing loadkeys on my notebook. The
other side of the issue came about a week ago when I upgraded from 12.0 to
12.1. When I now run 'startx' the line at the end of ~/.xfce4/xinitrc which
reads 'xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap' is no longer successfully executed. So, when Xfce
brings back the last session, I need to manually run this in a virtual
console.

   No errors are reported, so I have no idea why it's no longer being invoked
from the xinitrc file.

   Should I put a couple of ECHO statements in there to see if I can
determine when the processing bails out of that file?

Drew,

   Sigh. No joy. Still getting internal server errors. I changed other files
and directories from nobody.nobody to apache.apache but it made no
difference.

Thanks,

What do the logs show?

They should be in /var/log/apache/error_log

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu 8.10 and samba problem
Message-ID: <2349691E433F45338B52CB65DF490946@RAMA>

Help !

I have a samba server running on Centos 5.
I cannot seem to mount that samba share under Ubuntu 8.10.

I can mount from earlier versions of Ubuntu/Kubuntu and Fedora & Knoppix.
I have tried using:
   *  smbmount / cifsmount:
		mount -t smbfs -o workgroup=mshome,guest //goku/datashare
/share
		mount -t cifs -o workgroup=mshome,guest //goku/datashare
/share
		mount.cifs  //goku/datashare /share -o
workgroup=mshome,guest  
		mount.smbfs  //goku/datashare /share -o
workgroup=mshome,guest
   *  mounting using fstab:
           //goku/datashare  /share cifs
guest,rw,gid=99,uid=99,dir_mode=0775,file_mode=0775 0 0

What worked on the earlier versions of Ubuntu now gets a "mount error 111 =
Connection refused".

The documentation gives no clue on possible causes for this error.

Suggestions?

Yes, I only embarassed myself around my betters, not my clients.

echo running the command now > /home/rshepard/xinitrc.log

something like that.

It seems to me the simplest way to handle the possessive apostrophe case 
would be to tack on a second perl bit that makes sure final S's are 
lowercase; replace 

 perl -p -e 's/(\\w+)/\\u\\L$1/g;'

with

 perl -pe 's/(\w+)/\u\L$1/g; s/S\b/s/g;'

e.g.:

$ echo "SAM FRED'S O'MALLEY'S" | perl -pe 's/(\w+)/\u\L$1/g; s/S\b/s/g;'
Sam Fred's O'Malley's

(notice I said simple, not elegant.)

As a followup, I'd also note that you can simplify this whole line by:

* combining all the sed invocations into a single one
* replacing the backticks with $( ... )  (assuming you're using bash or 
ksh)
* dumping the double-quotes around the whole thing 

to produce:

newName=$(echo $i | perl -pe 's/(\w+)/\u\L$1/g; s/S\b/s/g;' | sed -e 
's/_/\ /g' -e 's/ */ /g' -e 's/[mM][pP]3/mp3/g' -e 's/[mM]4[aA]/m4a/g')

John,

Thanks, but that doesn't help.  They tried many of the same things I have.

I can get to the samba share using Nautilus, but I want it mounted so I can
address it with a file path.

Drew,

   This is part of the frustration. As I wrote in an earlier message (easily
overlooked, I know), there are no entries more recent than Nov. 29th in
either error_log or access_log. That was the weekend I upgraded the server
to -12.0.

   The last entry is typical:

Error: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
         Is the server running locally and accepting
         connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
Compilation failed in require at /usr/local/sql-ledger/login.pl line 85.
[Sat Nov 29 11:50:17 2008] [notice] caught SIGTERM, shutting down

   Yes, the socket is present:

srwxrwxrwx 1 postgres users  0 2008-12-10 06:04 /tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432=
-rw------- 1 postgres users 26 2008-12-10 06:04 /tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432.lock

   The lack of information on why I see either 'access denied' or 'internal
server error' makes it very difficult to isolate the problem and fix it.

Many thanks,

Rich

Not sure if Ubuntu works like Debian with regard to
flashplugin-nonfree, but in Debian when you install the package, the
download is from Macromedia's servers, not Debian's.  So it's
something of an automated seperate download.

There are a few other packages that work like this -- Microsoft fonts,
for example.

Subject: [PLUG] Is it Comcast or Motorola?
Message-ID: <20081210085734.ec465c0c.johnxj@comcast.net>

I have Comcast cable at home, connected with a Motorola SB5100
SurfModem. The network is ethernet; all components are rated cat6.

I download distros via torrent using Ktorrent 3.1.2 on Intrepid. I like
to set Ktorrent to allow a lot of connections per torrent because it
increases the download speed. I also like to leave it running until the
share ratio is at least 1.00 (which means that I have uploaded as many
bytes as I have downloaded). I do this with my desktop computer.

The other day I upgraded my laptop to Intrepid. After the progress
window said it had finished downloading all the new packages I started
downloading four versions of Kubuntu on the desktop, because I figured I
no longer needed any bandwidth for the laptop upgrade. The maximum
allowable connections per torrent was set to 500. In the middle of
installing all the new packages the laptop upgrade halted on
flashplayer. Looking at the terminal I could see that it was
downloading flash. I didn't realize that it hadn't really finished
downloading *all* the new packages. It had stalled on the flash
download. Looking at Ktorrent on the desktop I could see that it had
also stalled.

After several minutes of scratching my head in panic over the stalled
upgrade I decided to power cycle the modem. A minute or two after
plugging it back in the network was back and the laptop upgrade
proceeded normally. Ktorrent also started back up.

Since then I have had to power cycle the modem every hour or so to
restore the connection. I have set Ktorrent down to allow only 50
connections per torrrent, but I still lose the connection, even with
only four torrents running. If I leave Ktorrent on Pause the connection
stays up perfectly.

So I am wondering if it is Comcast or the modem. Comcast swears they
are no longer throttling torrents. (Now they just charge you extra if
you exceed 100 GB per month.) Every recent discussion that Google can
find leads me to believe they are telling the truth. The modem is
several years old. Maybe all the bits that have passed through it have
finally eroded its little wires. :)

Or maybe there is something about having too many connections that gets
the modem flummoxed.

It could also be Ktorrent, but that seems less likely to me. It is a
new version that came with Intrepid, but I have been using Ktorrent for
years without a problem.

Does anyone here have any experience that could shed light on the
issue? Suggestions for troubleshooting?

   Stand by, Drew and everyone.

   The new logs are in /var/log/httpd/ since the package name has changed.
The error_log reports problems with the perl scripts (so what else is new,
right?) and I'll work my way through them later today.

  Thanks to Wes for prompting me to look more closely at the respective
httpd.conf files.

I having issues with Comcast as well as my modem loses its connection after 12 hours. I reset the modem and my hardware router still has the DHCP lease assigned. Once I reset the modem I'm good for another 12 hours. My modem is an old RCA DCM105 modem that is DOCSIS 1.0 and so I'm wonder it the modem is starting to die as I have had that modem since I got service from @Home back is early 2000 (nearly 9 years ago). I believe my hardware router is OK as I can connect to the local network OK and the internal DHCP server is assigning an address on my laptop when I go through my WIFI access point.

depending on what he's doing with $newName (anything other than

Comcast ( A.K.A Comcan't ) was limiting downloads because their
network is inadequate.  Their network is still inadequate, but
they removed the limits to avoid censure.  

As I understand it, one of the inadequacies is limited bandwidth
signal amplifiers in the local loop, between your cable and their
switching centers.  I was told (by a second-level Comcast service
tech) that the power consumption of the amplifiers is a function 
of data rates, and that they overheat with high packet rates.
That sounds like flakey design, but I can imagine legacy hardware
behaving like that.

One of the main reasons I switched fromn Comcast to Verizon FIOS
is that the fiber infrastructure is first rate, and potentially
enormously fast.  Coax cable local loops are at their limits,
so Comcast will have to replace their entire infrastructure if
they want to improve.  Since I like competition, I hope they
survive, but not enough to suffer from their service myself.

What to do?  Can you schedule your downloads to occur when other
people on your local loop aren't using the Internet?  See if that
helps.  "at" is your friend.

Maybe run tcpdump or some other packet capture software and see if
they are doing something nefarious. It could be the motorola gear but
I doubt it. I've beat the ever living crap out of one and it still
worked flawlessly.

I am suffering from a similar issue albeit on a windows box using qwest dsl.

   A very public "thank you" to Wes for pointing me to the correct error_log
file location. For whatever reason, there was no README that expanded on the
implications of changing the apache package to an httpd package. Sigh.

   Looking at the file I found the source of the problem: the DBD::Pg module
was for the previous version of perl, not the updated version installed with
the -12.x series. I know we have folks here who think the programming sun
rises and sets on perl, but I find it opaque, fragile, and a serious PIMyA.

   Regardless, the pain is gone. Running CPAN and installing the latest and
greatest Pg.pm fixed the problem. I now have access to SQL-Ledger.

   A sincere thanks to Drew, too, for sharing his greater Slackware expertise
in helping me find the subtle changes that I miss since I'm only a part-time
SysAdmin.

   It turns out this is a documented bug in xinit that is triggered by having
the xmodmap line following the xfce4-session line in ~/.xfce4/xinitrc.
Moving that command above the session command fixes the problem.

   The xinitrc file on my server/workstation is different from the one on the
notebook for some reason. That's why I saw this behavior on only the latter
host.

Our Postfix mail server can no longer access the RBL at 
zen.spamhaus.org.  The maillog has many entries like this one:

Dec 10 17:51:58 zinc postfix/smtpd[11092]: warning:

This seems to have started occurring sometime between late June and 
late August(I know.  I should pay closer attention to the logs.).  I 
wonder if we are being blocked.  I just reviewed the usage policy 
(http://www.spamhaus.org/organization/dnsblusage.html), and our mail 
server is nowhere near the limits for free use.  Has anyone else had 
this happen?  Is there any recourse other than paying for a data feed?

Looks like a DNS error.

No idea why there would be a reverse IP appended to  zen.spamhaus.org

   I see this occasionally in my mail log. But, I also see successful lookups
at zen.spamhaus.org. I attribute it to sporatic glitches.

Have you always run 500 connections per torrent? I use 50 and just 
adjust the overall upload speed to allow me to browse at decent speeds 
still. 500 just seems like a lot if you're running multiple torrents.

Thanks to all for the suggestions and observations.

The Intrepid upgrade installed Ktorrent 3.1.2 on KDE 4.1.3. When I
first launched it I was getting horrible download speeds. It was set to
a maximum of 10 connections per torrent by default. Unfortunately, I do
not recall how many connections per torrent the previous version was
set to. 

Because of the horrible download speed I bumped it up to 100, then 200,
then finally 500 connections per torrent. If I recall correctly I was
trying to get Fedora, which had hundreds of seeders. I had no problem
at that time with the net connection. 

Now that I am having problems I have knocked it back to 10 connections
per torrent and am still getting disconnected every few minutes.
Ktorrent worked fine with 500 connections per torrent before, but now
can't handle even 10. Because of this I conclude that it is not
Ktorrent. On the other hand, in the past I have been surprised by my
failure to grasp something obvious, so who knows for sure?

Keith's suggestion that it might be Comcast's equipment makes a lot of
sense. However, unless I miss my guess, the situation is continuing to
deteriorate. Right now I can't run even one torrent at 10 connections
without getting disconnected. And the disconnect first happened after a
couple of hours, where now I get cut off in a matter of minutes after
taking Ktorrent off Pause.

So at this point I'm voting for the modem as the culprit. Anyway,
they're not expensive, so a quick trip to Fry's may confirm or disprove
the modem hypothesis. Worst case I end up with an unneeded cable modem.

What happens if you don't run Ktorrent, i.e. just normal connection and 
modest browsing?

I remain reliably connected. 

But that may not mean much. Checking e-mail and browsing a couple web
pages doesn't tax things a lot.

Try downloading a DVD from a fast mirror.

With all this public announcement of your bittorrenting habit, maybe
the net cops are on to you, and are messing with you on a
protocol-specific basis.  If you really want to find out if it's the
modem or the ISP, try switching to a different cable provider.

Let me verify what I think you want: Some way to have a filesystem mirrored
real-time, to a remote location, via a network connection, and you are
asking whether rsync can do this for you.

Well, from what I know of rsync, (which is hardly anything, so don't think
this is definitive,) it merely synchronizes files as they are when it is
run.  If you wanted the files to be synchronized between your system and a
backup location often, you'd have to re-run rsync say every minute via a
scheduled task or something.  If this were good enough for your purposes,
then maybe that works.  Someone with a better understanding of rsync and
_all_ of it's features may be able to shed more light on this matter for you
however.  I've only used it for backup purposes, where real-time
synchronization was never a requirement.

Greetings all,

Is it possible to block an IP after three attempts to login to a server???

I have a server that I use to host websites for my clients and every once
in a while, someone will try to bring it down or at least gain access to
it via a brute force attack. Thus, I would like to simply only allow three
attempts from any one IP address. Once they have failed, block the IP
permanently.

Any thoughts???

With regards,
Ron

Denyhosts does exactly this!  It's a perl script that runs as a daemon
from /etc/init.d.  It puts IP addresses into hosts.deny after the
configured number of failed login attempts.

I like to a step further, and disallow password authentication
entirely.  On my public-facing server, I must use authorized keys.  I
still run denyhosts though, using ssh as a honeypot to attract the
undesirables of the internet, for the same people might try to attack
other services as well.

rsync does not "freeze" the filesystem to get a true snapshot in time.
It merely copies files as it comes to them.  One technique that works
reasonably well is to run the command twice.  The second time it will
run a lot faster, thereby narrowing the window of time between the
beginning and end of the command's runtime greatly.

You can get rid of -HpogDlr.  You only need -a, and if you want
verbosity -v, and if you want more verbosity --progress.

I usually use --exclude-from, and put the file in /etc.  My file looks
like this:

/proc
/tmp
/var/tmp/portage
/sys

I'm thinking that /proc and /sys are mount points:

/proc on /proc type proc (rw,nodiratime)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec)

I would exclude /dev too, if I were sure that there were no persistent
device nodes.  But I'm not.

Even on a busy server, there is probably only small spots on the
filesystem that are changing all that much.  rsync will race right
through those.  but it won't be a perfect snapshot in time.  If that
is what you need, maybe LVM2 snapshots?

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0812110900120.23526@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have learned by experience that /dev/console is apparently created anew
each time the system boots. The device is owned by group tty, and I added my
user self to that group, then changed the permissions from crw------- to
crw-r-----. That worked when I logged out then logged back in.

   However, after shutting down the system overnight and rebooting today, I
see that the permissions are returned to root access only. This means that
loadkeys won't run because I don't have root permissions. Annoying.

   What would be the most appropriate way to get past this issue? Perhaps
editing /etc/sudoers to all user me to run loadkeys as root? Would this work
within the .bash_profile script?

   What is particularly frustrating is the non-working loadkeys and xmodmap
are isolated on my notebook. There have been no similar problems with the
server/workstation.

You don't want a DOCSIS 1 device. My understanding (and I'll admit it 
may be flawed) is that it a) will limit your bandwidth and b) soon not 
work with Comcast's network.

If you're "renting" your modem, call Comcast and tell them you need a 
new one. Today.

If you own your device, buy yourself a new one and call Comcast to get 
it activated.

Sounds like udev.  I find a rule for /dev/console in
/etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev-default.rules:

rules.d/50-udev-default.rules:9:KERNEL=="console",              MODE="0600", OPTIONS="last_rule"

This page is a great doc for writing udev rules:

http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html

I'll bet you'll have the ownership rule figured out in minutes.

i'll give second vote for denyhosts.  what i like best about is that
my 20 or so public servers all run it, and once the brute force scan
starts on one IP, it rarely stops before going through all of them,
since some are contiguous addresses.  denyhosts can be configured to
report naughty IP's to a centralized server (yours or theirs--i use
the internet-wide one) and the other servers pick up the message about
it being naughty and deny it before it can start.  my hosts.deny files
on the machines using it are thousands of lines long (but that doesn't
seem to affect the speed of connections, even on some old slow 700mhz
machines).

in the past 3 months, i've seen a couple of attacks from a botnet or
similar--one login attempt per IP from a zillion different IP's, which
denyhosts won't catch with my settings.  fortunately those have been
focused on single servers and i can just disable ssh on an individual
server until the attacks stop.

Yeah, I have decided to get a new modem. I came to that decision after
googling on modem problems. The symptoms I am experiencing seem to be
echoed by a lot of people whose modems eventually died completely. 

The remaining problem is deciding which one to get and where to get it.
As far as I can tell Motorola is the only vendor of cable modems in the
US. They have half a dozen models, all of which are at least DOCSIS 2.0
and a couple of which are 3.0. There are other feature differences
also, but I don't understand what the features do. So first I have to
get educated and then I have to shop. And if I get something other than
the SB5101 (the successor to my SB5100), I'll probably have to order it
online. 

Keeping everything in my life running is a full time job. I have too
much crap.

   Yup. I see this.

   Good resource, thanks.

   Nope. I keep failing.

   When the system boots and I su to root I can change /dev/console from 0600
to 0660. I then return to my user self can successfully run loadkeys.

   So, after reading the above web page I created
/etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules. This file has one line:

KERNEL=="console",      MODE="0666", OPTIONS="last_rule"

Just for giggles I made it 666 rather than 660 (which works manually).

   Then I save the file and reboot. /dev/console comes up as 0600 once again.
There must be something I'm missing that prevents user me as a member of the
tty group access /dev/console so I can run loadkeys from within
.bash_profile.

   Even after taking out the "last_rule" option it still does not work. Yet,
this all worked out of the box prior to 12.0 or 12.1; I forget now when I
noticed the change.

Thanks,

Rich

This looks suspiciously like the .rules files are ordered by their
leading numbers in the same way init scripts are ordered.  Since your
local rules file starts with a lower number, it is probably being run
first, and then is later overritten by the default rules.

What if you rename your 10-local.rules file to 99-local.rules?

Rogan,

   Yes, they are read sequentially.

   According to the web page on writing udev rules, they're not overridden by
later changes. But, the page also mentions that they are applied
sequentially so multiple rules can be written for the same device. It does
not say what happens if the rules address the same action.

   Regardless, I'll try it the other way .... Nope. No difference.

Thanks,

Rich

Also look into AllowUsers or AllowGroups in sshd_config as a good addition
to your ssh belt tightening.

Another thing that might be an issue is if /dev/console is already written
to the hard drive.  Perhaps udev doesn't touch already-existing device
nodes.  You might want to boot with knoppix, mount the root partition, and
check.  If it's there, delete it.

The continuing saga:

So far I have determined that cable modems are available from Motorola,
Arris, Linksys and RCA. RCA modems have a horrible reputation with
consumers, so they are scratched off the list. Linksys cable modems all
have wireless routers built in (which I do not need or want). Motorola
seems to have the highest reputation. 

Comcast tells me they are rolling out DOCSIS 3.0 on December 16.
Therefore, it makes sense to get a DOCSIS 3.0 modem. Any DOCSIS 3.0
modem is backwards compatible with DOCSIS 2.0, 1.1 and 1.0. Comcast
gave me a list of modem models, but none are DOCSIS 3.0.

Motorola makes one DOCSIS 3.0  modem for the US market: the model
SB6101.

I can't find anyplace that sells the SB6101. Even Motorola won't sell
me one, as they seem to do only large wholesale lots; no consumer
sales. Arris seems to have some DOCSIS 3.0 modems, but I can't even
figure out which models they are. Not that it matters because
apparently Arris also does wholesale business only.

Local stores sell the Motorola SB5101 only (Circuit City, Fry's, Best
Buy). Enuinc sells no cable modems at all. The SB5101 has an excellent
reputation, but is still just a DOCSIS 2.0 modem. It is the successor t
my SB5100, which lasted me about six years.

Unanswered questions:

If Comcast is rolling out DOCSIS 3.0 on December 16, what happens to
all their current users who have DOCSIS 2.0 modems? Will they see a
speed boost? If so, what would be the point of getting a DOCSIS 3.0
modem? If not, why is Comcast making a big deal in their advertising
about impending speed increases?

The more I figure out the more confused I become.

If later rules don't override earlier rules, all that's left is to edit the
existing rule.

wes,

   I was thinking of trying this. If the permissions are set the same way in
both .rules files perhaps they'll show up that way after booting is
complete, and will allow ~/.bash_profile to run loadkeys.

   Will report results.

Carlos,

   My copy of Knoppix is so old the disk has fossilized. I have no current
bootable disk with a 2.6 kernel. However, Real Soon Now ....

I could do lookups against the zen.spamhaus.org RBL at work, but not
at home. Do you rely on your ISP's nameservers? Maybe they consider
your ISP "high traffic" and are dropping them.

I've noticed that I can query a spamhaus.org nameserver directly and
get a response, but not via my ISP's nameservers, FWIW:

They're rolling out a service that doesn't yet have products to market 
that match it. That's why you can't buy the modems yet. Nothing will 
happen to the 2.0 modem users. They will get their speed boost as 
advertised.

DOCSIS 2.0 supports speeds well beyond anything Comcast offers right 
now. I recommend getting a Toshiba. I had one when using Comcast for 
years and it was rock solid. I might have to move back over to them. 
They have a business package for $70 that is 12Mb/2Mb after the speed 
increase with 5 statics.

Download an ISO via HTTP instead of Torrent and see what happens to the
connection or see if you can use a proxy for your traffic to hide it from
any sniffing Comcast is doing. You'll be taxing it then. Pick a fast mirror
like kernel.org.

That was already suggested, and I did it. I downloaded the Edubuntu
addons from cat.pdx.edu directly instead of via torrent (3-400 MB each)
and they downloaded without issue.

But when using torrents you have dozens if not hundreds of connections.
Plus, (I don't understand this well) there is a lot of back and forth
to the tracker. I haven't been using torrents for the past 24 hours and
my connection has been fine. But when downloading Fedora recently I had
500 connections per torrent and I was downloading/uploading four
torrents - no problem at all. Now I can't maintain even ten connections
per torrent for just two torrents without getting disconnected.

Something has changed. 

Add the fact that when using Ktorrent I first got disconnected every 12
hours or so. Now I get disconnected every 15 minutes. The degradation
has been a straight line. If Comcast was throttling torrents I would
assume it would be an all or nothing situation, not a gradual
degradation in service. 

And one other matter - if you google on cable modem problems you will
find dozens of posts from consumers whose modems failed. And just about
every one says they had to recycle the modem more and more often until
finally they couldn't restore the connection at all. The symptoms echo
what is happening to me.

I can't be sure it's the modem, but it is six years old and all fingers
are pointing at it, yelling "j'accuse!"

So I may be posting later that I was completely wrong. But for the
moment the #1 suspect is the modem. Maybe Microsoft has an investment
in Motorola, so it has a feature which makes it die after so many Linux
downloads. :)

It looks like the best option at the moment is a Motorola SB5101. I'm
off to buy one on eBay or wheverever.

Sounds reasonable. If you decide it's something else and want to
troubleshoot I'd be happy to let you proxy your torrents which should
mask the data and you can determine if its comcast or not :)

Well, you can still try things until your new modem comes in. What if you
try 1 torrent with 1 connection?

Just an update on my thoughts.

John, could be the modem (I wasn't convinced at first). As I mentioned I was
suffering a similar situation using different gear. Thinking I was being
Sanvined by Qwest I tunneled everything through SSH and still had some weird
issues. I found a new firmware image for the Actiontec CPE I am using and it
seems like at least tunneled torrents are being downloaded properly without
issue. I haven't tried to test without using a tunneled proxy set up yet
though, that will answer at least my question. The new firmware did
anecdotally make a difference though.

I haven't been running any torrents for the past 48 hours. This morning
the modem was dead. After power cycling it I surfed for a few minutes,
then downloaded the morning's e-mail. It crapped out halfway through
the e-mail. Time to say kaddish for it, I fear.

There are two used ones on Craig's list locally, or the best deal on a
new one is at Wally World for 61.57. Interestingly, they also have a
Linksys CM100 for 69.74.

I have one without a power supply but its sitting in storage and if I knew I
could find it quickly I'd give it to you (brand new just no power supply ...
long story about that) ... If you don't source one in the next few days let
me know and I'll do my best to dig it out.

   Yes, it has been a long time and it is nice to see public kudos to two

Free Geek normally has them too, but the box is empty at the moment.

After further googling I discovered that owners of Linksys CM100 modems
love them, especially those who switched from a Motorola modem. So I
found one locally and talked them into $55 for it. It took some hassle
to get Comcast to recognize it because the idiot forgot to tell his
software that it should no longer be looking for a Motorola.

I have to say that it seems significantly faster. Whether that was due
to the degraded condition of the old modem or what I cannot say. A lot
of people have reported significantly faster speeds with the CM100
compared to the Motorola SB5101 and SB5120, even when both are brand
new.

Anyway, the saga is at an end. (I hope.)

I purchased a Motorola SB5101 modem today and I called Comcast to update my 
modem's MAC address. I plugged the new modem in and it started up before I 
called Comcast support.  Once I got through all of the phone menus I got a 
rep on the phone.  With the status page showing my new modem was operational 
I gave the guy my new MAC address.  It didn't show up on their system and so 
he made me connect my old modem again. It showed I was operational as it 
showed up their network.

I was glad I was persistent and so I told him I wanted to reconnect the new 
modem again and power it up. It finally showed up on their network with the 
assigned MAC address. He set it up and told me it was going to reboot and 
once I rebooted my hardware router everything was working again.

My download speeds are quite a bit faster and peak out at around 6mbps now. 
Now I need to return my Comcast owned modem or I'll keep getting charged 
$3.00 a month. Cable modems are pretty cheap now and so I've wasted quite a 
bit of money for renting a modem for nearly 9 years now.

What ATSC format(s)?  Some of the cards don't support the ATSC QAM format
needed to pick up unencrypted signals from cable.

I have a Haupagge HVR-950 that is plug and play with Ubuntu Intrepid
(previous releases required compiling the driver manually).  However, the
HVR-950 only supports broadcast HDTV and the analog tuner conflicts with
other Happauge PVR-150 cards and the analog tuner audio doesn't work.

Evidently they have to tell their software what brand modem you have
first. In my case we tried several times and he finally concluded there
was something wrong with the connection because he could not see the
new modem at all. He even scheduled a repair person to come out. I
couldn't believe that there was something wrong with the brand new
Linksys modem, so I called back fifteen minutes later. This time I got
a different guy. He asked what kind it was, and a few moments after I
told him it was a Linksys it showed up just fine. Evidently the first
guy just assumed I had bought another Motorola.

This is interesting. I went to speedtest.com and ran the test four times:

Interesting that you get twice as much bandwidth as I do.

You might want to call Comcast to come out and check the line condition. 
Do you use splitters or anything for the coax going to your modem? Low 
signal levels can take out a modem eventually.

See the link to the debian report.  Are you blocking udp?

I have never seen this problem with etch or lenny, but then I don't 
block udp on the internal network.

I'm not a habitual ubuntu user, but on Debian recently (like ~6
months) I had a little disruption to my nfs happiness that required
adding some options to the client's /etc/fstab.  Not sure that's at
all related.

I went to speedtest.com today and I'm still getting around 6mbps although one 
test my download speed was down to 5.6mbps.  My comcast connection has been 
up more then 12 hours now so I believe my connection issues was caused by old 
DOCSIS 1.0 cable modem.  I've returned the Comcast owned modem today and so 
my cable connection is going to be $3.00 less a month now.

Subject: [PLUG] booting from a compact flash card
Message-ID: <20081214235433.GA3414@gate.kl-ic.com>


I'm using compact flash cards as the boot drive for an ALIX
single board computer.  I'm also looking at building a new
computer for my wife's office, where quiet and power savings
are important, and booting from a CF card might be an option.

Saturday (not as crowded as you might expect), Fry's was
selling Kingston 8GB 133x CF cards for $20, marked down from
the normal $50 .  This is about 500x more storage than the
ALIX will need, but it is a pretty good size for a small
Ubuntu system.  

I connected the card through a $20 SYBA IDE to CF adapter.
I installed Hardy 8.04.1, and it worked, more or less (it is
faster than the CD, but slower than a disk, based on subjective
impressions).

But it does work.  My wife uses her office machine for browsing
and email and some documents (stored on another server).  I may
buy a 32GB card (they are under $100 at Newegg), but 8GB seems
to be enough.  

OTOH, there are SATA-II 30GB solid state drives (no adapter
necessary) for $75 after rebate at Newegg, and those run at
170MB/s read - apps would come up blazingly fast.  By the time
I actually build the system. the drives will probably be even
larger and cheaper.

I built a system based on the D201GLYL2 (celeron based, not atom) board I
picked up from Iguana Micro (locally in Hillsboro), about a year ago.
Including a GeForce 6200 and a 60-80 or so watt 12V DC/DC power supply, the
entire system draws maybe 40 watt from the wall plug at full-load.  (most of
that is the video card).  Can even play halflife 2 at 1920x1080 on low to
mid settings, so I'd assume the processors are plenty fast for what the
average user would need.

Beware of the SSD's.  Read the reviews.  Some drives do NOT work well on
filesystems that require frequent writes.  I'd read one review that said
that using reiser worked very well, however EXT3 performance on the same
drive was absolutely horrid.  Gotta do your research.

Good points.  Thanks for the feedback.

Of course, it is good to move caches and /tmp to RAM and set the
noatime option in /etc/fstab .  I found more useful ideas here:

http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2008/09/04/four-tweaks-for-using-linux-with-solid-state-drives/

Are there other pages I should be looking at?

I used ReiserFS for some systems, but I did not have good luck
with it - it was fast, but it did not handle disk errors well. 
And I worry about my wife's safety with Reiser around :-). 
Your mileage may vary, of course. 

I will have to think about ext2 vs. ext3 vs. "other".  I expect I
will set up a boot partition with ext2 (journalling is not needed
if the files don't change much), and use some solid-state-friendly
file system such as jffs2 for the main partition (or at least
/home and /var).  More to learn...

The Linux 2.6.27 has a

UBIFS is a new filesystem designed to work with flash devices,
developed by Nokia with help of the University of Szeged

Interesting to know about - but UBIFS is designed to work with
raw flash memory devices, such as the ones in PDAs and cell
phones, not memory products with built-in controllers like
Compact Flash Cards (CF) and Solid State Drives (SSD).  Unless
there is some way to bypass the controller and get at the raw
memory at the erase block level (128Kb or more) I can't use
UBIFS.  Here is "The Big Red Note" from the second document:

   One thing people have to understand when dealing with UBIFS is
   that UBIFS is very different to any traditional file system -
   it does not work on top of block devices (like hard drives,
   MMC/SD cards, USB flash drives, SSDs, etc). UBIFS was designed
   to work on top of raw flash, which has nothing to do with block
   devices. This is why UBIFS does not work on MMC cards or USB
   flash drives - they look like block devices to the outside
   world because they implement FTL (Flash Translation Layer)
   support in hardware, which simply speaking emulates a block
   device on top of the built-in flash chip.

I will be working with either Compact Flash (which has an IDE
parallel interface) or with a SATAII solid state drive.  Those
have built-in controllers and block level ATA interfaces.  
Since UBIFS looks like "The Best Way To Do It", there will
hopefully be standards and devices available in the next few
years that support the raw flash interface, permitting the
use of UBIFS at the consumer level.  

Thanks for the pointer, though.  If I ever work with a device
that provides direct access to the flash (I imagine that
reprogrammable wireless access points, the Google Android,
and other open platforms do) then UBIFS will be very useful.

Interesting stuff. This bit from an Acer Aspire Wiki concurs:
http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Acer_Aspire_One 

"Solid state drives are made of flash memory, they are fast in reading
but slow in writing data and you cannot overwrite countless times, so
for a long SSD life take care to:

     1. Never choose to use a journaling file system on the SSD
        partitions.
     2. Never use a swap partition on the SSD.
     3. Edit your new installation fstab to mount the SSD partitions
        "noatime".
     4. Never log messages or error log to the SSD.

These rules ensure that we won't reach the maximum limit of writes on
our SSD faster than we should."

Thanks,
Mike

Message-ID: <20081215052053.GA4105@gate.kl-ic.com>


While playing with compact flash cards for hard disk replacement, I
also built Ubuntu on top of a 4GB USB thumb drive attached to my
Thinkpad T30.  The T30 has a USB1.1 interface, and is dreadfully slow
with a flash drive - 5 minutes to boot and login to the desktop. 

I plan to use a flash drive as my OpenVPN certification environment.
Running offline and booting from the flash, I can sign keys for VPN
clients without exposing the process to The Bad Guys.  I then copy
the keys to the hard drive, boot normally, and distribute the keys to
the appropriate machines.  If I was extra paranoid, I could boot each
target machine from the thumb drive and copy one key each, offline.

Perhaps there is an easier way to do it.  I don't want to sign
keys with an online machine, I don't want to maintain a whole
offline computer, and 4GB thumb drives are less than $10 and easily
carried around.  I can keep a couple of spares locked in my safe.

That goes for jffs2 as well.  On Alix and other x86 targets, OpenWrt
does a mtd-block layer to pretend that the block device provided by
the CF card is really a raw flash device so that it can still use
jffs2.  Perverse but true.  Well, either true or I am really confused.

I have one of these, and love it!  It's not super-fast, but it's
basically equivalent to the five-year-old IBM desktop that's my main
development machine.  It's running Ubuntu 8.10 easy as you please.
It's inaudible from 2' away, and draws less than 20 watts (according
to reviews; I haven't measured yet.)

Um... Dual-core atoms are already out.
http://iguanamicro.com/ind9mimowiin.html is Intel's mini-itx offering with a
dual-core hyper-threaded atom chip.  My only concern is the chipsets are hot
enough to require a fan...  A tiny fan... That can wear out easily as all
tiny fans do...  My next mini-itx system will probably be purchased around
2nd quarter, when hopefully they have developed a low-power chipset to go
with the atom CPU's.

When using CompactFlash as a drive, it can be a good idea to get the
faster cards.  There are 266x and 300x cards which cost a little more
but greatly improve the performance.  266x is 40 MB/s which is getting
closer to the performance of a slow hard drive.

One advantage I discovered is that the CompactFlash card can be
written with a card reader on another machine.  This was very handy
when putting together a machine without a CD or floppy drive.

Fedora has a tool [1] that creates bootable USB flash drives from live
CDs. I think it has been ported to Ubuntu [2].

That looks handy!  I'll check it out.  One of the problems I
had when installing to a flash drive from an Ubuntu 8.04.1 Heron
LiveCD was getting the grub setup to ignore the hard disk in the
laptop I was doing this with.  I had to pull the hard disk first.
Hopefully, this program is smarter than that.

The other problem I have is peculiar to my Thinkpad T30s.  When
setting up the BIOS, is considers removable devices to equate to
floppy disks - a USB thumb drive is considered a hard disk, and
always the second one unless I go into BIOS setup before every
boot and swap the boot order of the drives.  Which, I assume,
is wearing out the NVRAM in the laptop.  Fooey.

Codeless GUI Programming
  A Declarative Syntax Layer for Desktop Graphical User Interfaces

This will be the world premiere of a game-changing advancement in the 
development of desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  FreeTUIT 
removes the verbosity, tedium, and confusion from GUI development and 
provides a unified syntax for widget layout and configuration which 
supports good software design practice without getting in the way of 
rapid application development.

FreeTUIT is a syntax and runtime for concisely declaring the layout and 
configuration of GUI widgets (such as forms, toolbars, buttons, and 
dialogs).  The freetuit interpreter drives a unified object layer which 
is accessible from event callbacks.  This takes you from a blank page 
to a static demo of the layout with zero setup and allows desktop 
applications to be developed and deployed faster than web applications 
by simply removing the HTML, CSS, XML, HTTP, Javascript, Database, 
Network, and User Agent components.

Jax is next to the 2nd Ave Max stop, so you don't need to park at the
downtown icerink.

I use the next-tier lower of paranoia. The CA configs and keys live in 
an encrypted filesystem. I only mount it to create and sign new certs, 
then I umount it. My backup software archives the encrypted blog only.

index.html, I get a message from Firefox that says,

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Opening

You have chosen to open

(blank line)

which is a: PHTML file
from: http://localhost

What should Firefox do with this file?

( )  Open with [Browse...]
(.) Save File

...
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If I replace index.php with an index.html, it works.

I tried Googling, and got instructions that don't match what I have. One 
of them wants me to edit /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini. I don't have /etc/php5.

Does this mean that, even though it shows as installed in Synaptic, php5 
isn't really installed?

Is there some other location I should look at to find php.ini?

Is there a step I missed for which I haven't found the documentation?

TIA.

having php and having apache set up to use php are entirely different beasts.

nope, that is where it should be.  however, i can't tell where it came
from--that file doesn't appear to be owned by any package though that
directory is multiply-owned.  below are the php-related packages i
have installed for my successful apache2/php5 hardy server.  obviously
you won't need curl, gd, mcrypt, mysql, or pgsql, unless you do =)  i
think that libapache2-mod-php5 is the most likely missing candidate,
and after you install him, you may need to use a2enmod(8) to inform
your apache install about it.

i've also noticed that using the apache2ctl utility to muck with
apache does not always do the right thing, for instance, when changing
certain config directives (ssl-related for the most part) and other
configuration settings re: modules, so you might want to do an
old-school /etc/init.d/apache2 restart instead of an apache2ctl
graceful or whatever your norm is.

Gentoo is nice because it has a very modular way of arranging the config. 
That makes it easy for me to copy and paste everything you need to get
apache to run PHP correctly.  It doesn't matter which distro you are
using, this stuff doesn't change hardly at all.  The <IfDefine PHP5> may
not apply directly; gentoo passes -D PHP5 into apache on the command line.

You will definitely need the LoadModule and AddType lines.  The
DirectoryIndex makes it so that any directory you visit with an index.php
or index.phtml file will cause it to be automatically run.

<IfDefine PHP5>
    # Load the module first
    <IfModule !mod_php5.c>
        LoadModule php5_module    modules/libphp5.so
    </IfModule>

    # Set it to handle the files
    <IfModule mod_mime.c>
        AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
        AddType application/x-httpd-php .phtml
        AddType application/x-httpd-php .php3
        AddType application/x-httpd-php .php4
        AddType application/x-httpd-php .php5
        AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
    </IfModule>

    DirectoryIndex index.php index.phtml
</IfDefine>

Once you are done putting this into your apache config (or simply figuring
out how to turn it on, as with the gentoo -D PHP5 command line switch),
don't forget to pay a visit to your php.ini file.

I tried restarting apache2 with and without the above, after I actually 
installing php5. It works the same for me either way. I have directories 
linked from index.php with other php files. They open as expected. They 
don't necessarily run correctly, but I expect that's because of other 
configuration issues, as I mentioned in my last post, since these old 
files are php4 and some of them have not-strict coding in them copied 
from a book I used several years ago.

Thanks for the info.

Also available here for $300:

http://www.amazon.com/Intel-Processor-Drive-Linux-Black/dp/B001HPNDJ2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=pc&qid=1229391808&sr=1-2

This looks pretty tasty.  Perhaps you can bring it to one of the
meetings and (with warning) I can look at it with my power meter,
and in general admire your purchasing acumen.  If you bring it to
the clinic, we can start it up with available monitors and keyboards.

Something so small presents a theft hazard (it is for my doctor
wife, who has patients with mental as well as physical problems)
but it supposedly will attach to the back of her LCD monitor.
Thieves must be very large and very ambitious to steal the monitor,
too.  It is also nifty that these are claimed to boot in a few
seconds, meaning that the machine can be quickly turned on and
off between uses, saving even more power.   Perhaps this is only
with the installed EZOS Linux distro (whatever that is).

It was offputting at first to see that it doesn't have a CD/DVD
drive.  External USB drives are surprisingly expensive, but I have
a USB case and a bare CD/DVD drive I can cobble together for the
rare occasions one is needed.  During the 99% of the time that an
internal CD drive is NOT being used, it just wastes space and power.

I asked my wife how often she uses the drive in her current office
machine (which the new system will replace) and she said "never,
I'm afraid to use it".  So perhaps I shouldn't worry about it.

Yeah, those look about the same size as what I built.  Same price too.
Granted, no assembly required for the Eee's.  Are those using the dual-core
processors?  (Shouldn't need the power of the second core, but it's a
difference of around 4 watt TDP between one and two cores...  I've even
considered using one of these low-power systems for a low-traffic email/web
server...  Do they have an internal or external power supply?  (Have to
consider availability of (I assume) proprietary power supplies if it's
internal).  Also, some of these small cases have a laptop tether slot so you
can lock them to your desk, etc...

Sorry I came in late to the game.

In Synaptic, look for the package libapache2-mod-php5. Is that installed?

Do you get any error output when restarting apache with the above configs
included?

does modules/libphp5.so exist?

Anything interesting in the logs?

What started this thread for me was working with an ALIX board from
PC Engines, running the flash-optimized OpenWRT.  Using a CF card
with JFFS for mass storage, these consume 3 to 4 watts, and the full
kit costs less than $200 (and a heck of a lot of time to configure)
from Netgate.com .

I will be using mine for a firewall, OpenVPN, DNS, DHCP, etc. 
The ALIX uses an AMD Geode with a built-in crypto engine, so it
runs AES encryption faster than its 500MHz clock would imply.

I'm not sure ALIX boards make good email servers - flash writes
relatively slowly.  But if you keep your email forever, like I do,
then flash seems as good a way as any to do so.  With volatile
files and queues stored in ramdisk you are not limited by flash
write time, but there is a risk of losing messages during power
failures.  On the other hand, at 4 watts, a small battery backup
unit will last a long time.

The ALIX has a connector for a 2.5 inch hard drive instead of a
CF card, but the power would go up and it probably would not fit
in the metal case that Netgate offers.  The ALIX does not have a
connector for video, though the Geode chip has video outputs.

For an interactive desktop system, I want a faster processor, and
the Atom-based machines look right for that.

PTP plans to standardize on these, so there will be a lot of local
knowledge around here.

I read that some of the atom processors do hardware virtualization.  
Anyone know if that is the case with the eee box?

Supposedly the xo laptop goes to sleep and wakes up between keypresses.  
I have to wonder how that works with the network.  But a few seconds to 
reach an X session from a cold boot?  Perhaps from suspend to disk if 
all of the bios slowness has been somehow eliminated?

Nice.  Yeah, with the Atom stuff you are never gonna get to that low of
power....  The chips run at about 4-8 watt, but the northbridges consume
something around 20 IIRC...  Still, for a mini-itx board with onboard video
and CPU under 100 bucks, the Atom boards are pretty enticing.  Obviously
when they come out with lower-power boards next year sometime it won't be
too expensive to upgrade and get better power efficiency...  And plus, at
this power range, they sell DC/DC power supplies that run off of 12 volts.
Meaning you can run one of these off a car battery for quite a while...  (In
an emergency, of course).

Yes.

For some unknown reason my 3 attempts to reply to Chris McCraw's post on 
this problem have not made it to the list. In them I confess to 
mis-reading Synaptic's list. I discovered that php5 was not really 
installed. Once I corrected that, php5 works, although some of my old 
php scripts don't. My guess is that they are for php4 and are not 
"strict" enough for the way php5 is installed by Synaptic. That's 
something I can figure out as I go along, and will provide a useful 
refresher on php.

The only thing I get is a warning:

rsteff at moonguide:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
[sudo] password for rsteff:

apache2

Since I'm only using it in-house, and other machines in the house can 
see it when I surf to it by ip address, I'm not in a hurry to figure out 
how to correct that one.

Thanks for the reply. We'll see if this one makes it to the list this

Okay, this got through. The only difference is that on the Windows box,
AVG adds an anti-virus scan attachment. Is lists.pdxlinux.org setup to
drop mail with attachments? I'll try turning that off and see what happens.

Note that these AV attachments are essentially pointless.  What's to stop a
virus from adding them?  Even if they were digitally signed, there's no
way for the recipient to verify it.  These are just free advertisements
for the AV companies that fill up our intertubes.

Anyway, it's kinda weird that the mailing list didn't at least bounce
those messages back to you with an explanation, if this indeed was the
cause...

I certainly get bounces when I break the rules.

Like when I forget to change my From address to the one the list server
expects. Though that isn't a problem any more, gmail magically started doing
it for me within the last week or so. No idea why, but not complaining.

podcast++ :)

I'm very interested in this project, based on what was said in this
thread. However, I won't be able to make it down from Seattle for a
mid-week meeting.

A webpage with examples, source code, tutorials / etc. would be even
better ;) but a podcast and a link to the source would be a great
start.

I am just concerned that the weather may force Jax to close early.  I
will talk to them and see what they are wanting to do.

The weather report for tomorrow seems to indicate snow, rain, freezing
rain, or a combination of the three.

To run unsigned code on the PS2's you're gonna want (as with most sony
products that have various versions) either an old-model "fat" ps2, or a
modchip, maybe both.  Preferrably a good one, which can cost up to 60
bucks.  There's various ways of doing the hacks to get it booting, but yeah.

one came with the computer and the dealer where I bought it (Computek

I'm going to donate them to Free Geek, so if anyone needs them you can

Message-ID: <ca5165530812161942p54582d52x3b5eba11a3cbafdf@mail.gmail.com>

My goggle foo is not doing too well in finding an answer to this
question (if there is an easy one).

My problem:

I need to build source rpm packages from tarballs that are not in any
distribution (newer versions,
custom patches).  I do plan to build  the binary rpm in a chroot to
isolate the build dependencies via
a build package called mock.  The problem is that mock needs a
prebuild source rpm.

The other half of the problem is that when building the source rpm,
rpmbuild does a check of
the Buildrequires packages before it build the package.  These are
only needed when building
the binary package not the source package.

Is there a method to construct the source rpm without it requiring all
of the Buildrequires packages being
installed on the system that is building the source package?

"rpmbuild -bs foo.spec" doesn't need the BuildRequires to be installed
in my experience.

In my example case curl-7.19.2 on CentOS5.2/RHEL5.2/OL5.2:
[lbrigman at myhost SPECS]$ rpmbuild -bs curl.spec
error: Failed build dependencies:
        openssl-devel is needed by curl-7.19.2-1.x86_64

There are others that are more of a problem that this.

Hmm, very interesting to me that I could make Linux support possible
via replacement of a chip.  How do I find a mod chip for the Playstation
II these days?  How does going the mod chip route affect using the
Playstation II as a Playstation II?  Because Linux is under the GPL,
isn't Sony wrong to sell a proprietary Linux installation DVD anyways?

I suppose the Playstation II only runs at 300 mhz and I guess it is
limited to 32 megs of ram, but that is good enough for simple C
programming if I can get gcc on it.  Out of curiosity, has anyone
upgraded the amount of memory in their PS/2 successfully?

'rpmbuild -bs --nodeps curl.spec' should do the trick for you.

To run a disk it needs a special security measure pressed into the disk (at
manufacture) around the hub, before the data area.  Without this, the PS2
won't run whatever is on it.  There's exploits to get around sony's
lockdowns, IE: a modchip.  Basically you install a device that taps into the
busses for the PS2 and screws with the signals to trick the PS2 into
ignoring it's own security "features".  Depends what you use it for and what
the latest court results are as far as modchip use legality; I don't know,
and have not researched it.  Regardless, if I had the money and could
legally buy one, I'd probably do so, just because I don't like being limited
by the device's manufacturer.  There's other exploits for the fats like
using a specially crafted memory card save (which you can install yourself
for free) and a PS1 disk to trigger the running of unsigned-by-sony code,
and if you'd like I can provide info on it.  Basically if you can run
unsigned-by-sony code, you can do whatever you want, including run Linux,
say, from a burned CD/DVD or the fat's hard drive.  ...By the way, turns out
you can put up to a 500 gig drive in the old ones, so long as it matches one
of the models in a list somewheres.  Again, if you are interested I'll find
the links for you.

They appear to offer a mod chip for the play station 2.
I wonder what's involved in installing it?

All I want to do is throw Linux on this thing, I don't care about Sony's

But you care about being legal, so you can't not care about Sony's copy
protection schemes.

I am not familiar with that particular vendor. I use
http://www.modchipman.com/ and have had success in the past.

non-memory-card mod chips usually require soldering to install. In the case
of a slim PS2, we're talking about microsurgery style soldering skills.

Then just get an old computer. An XBOX would be a much better choice but 
honestly I don't get why you'd bother with modding game consoles if the 
only goal is to provide a programming platform for learning.

I'm trying to get a laptop for around the price of a mod chip.  The

isn't ideal for running Linux and the Playstation III is expensive.

Uhm a laptop for the price of just a mod chip???  As in around $50?  Or do
you mean the price of a PS2 + mod chip ($100-200)?
In that case you are in a more realistic ballpark, for a good old PIII or
single core Centrino from Craigslist or eBay (or FreeGeek).

One example: http://portland.craigslist.org/wsc/sys/961025874.html
Another: http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/sys/959962765.html

Old Dells are usually a safe bet for Linux, I have an old PII-200 Latitude
D300xt that runs Debian with Fluxbox or XFCE quite well.
PII era stuff would usually not have any built in networking (wifi or
ethernet), only modem, I use a PCMCIA ethernet card in it now.  PIII era
stuff should have ethernet and probably 802.11b, or maybe 802.11g depending
on the age.  Also look into old Thinkpads, similarly very good with Linux
usually.

Another possibility is an old PPC iBook or Powerbook, I have a couple old
Powerbooks, a G4 running OS X Leopard and Ubuntu dual boot, and an older G3
running Ubuntu.  G3 era has built in ethernet but not wifi, G4 era has
both.  Ubuntu doesn't "officially" support PPC anymore but it is now a
community version, other distros still do officially support it such as
Fedora.

At any rate good luck with it :).

But,  you will get more varied programming experiences from the PS3,
cell processors and all.

Well, PS2's are around 60-80 used, and then considering you DON'T have to do
the modchip route, just use the savegame FMCB (Free MemoryCard Boot)
exploit, I doubt you can find a laptop that cheap.  A laptop WOULD probably
be the better route to go though, in my opinion.  Just saying, there's ways
to get your consumer devices to bend to your will...  Furthermore, you could
buy a consumer disk such as Swap Magic, and run everything that way, without
opening the "do not remove under penalty of soul removal" warranty
sticker(s) on your device.

Unless I hear otherwise from Alan, I am assuming tonight's
Advanced topics meeting is cancelled.


Eric and I have not heard from Alan since his last announcement.
We are on the other side of the west hills, and in advance of an
alleged (noaa.gov) 4 inches of snow and perhaps some freezing rain.
I just spent two hours helping unjam the Tri-Met lift bus that
my mobility-challenged sister needed to get to work - the main
roads are OK, but the hills and some of the side streets are
lethal stupid.

Jax was not answering their phone at 800pm on Tuesday night.  They
left a message earlier (while I was stuck in 2mph traffic on the
way home) to ask if we were coming - I imagine we will have so few
people that it will not be worthwhile to for Barb to pay staff. 
The preceding meetings at Jax have been cancelled, so it would
be just us anyway.

So unless Alan disagrees loudly and soon, I will not be appearing
at Jax tonight with a projector, and Eric sounds like he is smart
enough to want to stay home.

Eric has a really exciting bit of software to premiere - but
perhaps it will have new features and be even more exciting in
January.  If that meeting is cancelled also, then I will give
a February talk titled "Thermonuclear Ice Removal with
Linux/GPS guidance systems".  Bring your radiation suit.

Agreed re: laptop (or just plain-old linux box).  Won't the PSII need
a keyboard / mouse of some sort?  (and if not... there had better be a
keyboard *somewhere* or programming won't be a whole lot of fun ;)

Call me simple, but given the choice, I'd write software for whatever
has the input devices :)

If you run linux, you can plug a usb mouse/keyboard in.  The old fat models
also have firewire...

Keith,

   The legislature will be in session. We can pipe the hot air up there to

Message-ID: <49494FB2.3090701@comcast.net>

Many web sites I visit have little icons that show up in the browser. 
For example, there's an icon composed of concentric c's next to the 
address bar when I'm connected to Comcast's e-mail reader, and a "g" 
(but in a different font) when I'm connected to Google.

What do you call that icon, and where to I go to look for specs, such as 
height and width, and what format it needs to be?

TIA.

it's a file called favicon.ico (typically, apparently not required,
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon).

You can look on wikipedia to start out.

Message-ID: <98afdbcd0812171212m47d6e079p5f6cb1f774a665a5@mail.gmail.com>

I've just built a new PC. It has a ASUS M2N-MX SE Plus motherboard with a
AMD X2 4600 CPU w/ 2GB RAM.
LG Super Drive and WD 250GB HDD. It's plugged into a Samsung Syncmaster 953
19" monitor

I'm having video problems with every distro I have. I wanted to install
Fedora 10 off the install DVD but once it gets to the installer it hangs and
goes nowhere. MInt, Ubuntu, both will boot up but the resolution says the
correct 1440x900 but it's not that at all. And the monitor is hard to
adjust. I've ran two other PCs with this motherboard and never had this kind
of problem. It must be the Nvidia nForce 430 video that having the problems.
A couple times it mentioned noapic but that didn't really help.

Where should I start to solve this problem? Any clues?

Thanks

Any way to install the nvidia drivers to see if that fixes the problem?
Maybe try vesa for now?  Different monitor? etc...  Just as a kludge until
you can get the system installed and booted, so you can install the nvidia
drivers.  That should take care of resolution issues.

   I have an nVidia GeForce 6150 board and use the nVidia driver with it.
This works with my Acer 19" wide screen monitor at 1440x900 dpi.

> Where should I start to solve this problem? Any clues?

   Look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log.

   Also, a trick I just recently learned is to run (as root), 'X --configure'
and use test the resulting xorg.conf to see if it does better.

Message-ID: <20081217233633.GA18514@gate.kl-ic.com>


Bring your Linux desktop or laptop to the Linux Clinic, 1pm to
5pm, Sunday December 21 (always the 3rd Sunday) at Free Geek,
1731 S.E. 10th in Portland.  We have wired and wireless internet,
monitors, keyboards, mice, coffee, and cookies (bring more!).

et cetera ...


We have a few more days of cold weather coming.  I still want
to help make the Linux Clinic happen Sunday, and if John shows
up with the key, and the power is on, we have pretty much all
we need, even if Free Geek doesn't open the store as planned.

Who knows?  If it is cold enough, we might get a visit from 
Tux the Penguin.  Bring herring, just in case.

I will be coming in over the West Hills from Beaverton, and
that may take two hours longer than normal each way.  Unlike
an evening meeting, it will be light for most of the trip, and
it will be easier to get rescued if something goes wrong.
Traffic will be light, and I have 4 wheel drive and chains.

I have two requests.  One, if you are expecting me to bring 
something (like a particular bit of hardware or software or
documentation) let me know at the email below. 

Second,  please suggest nearby places serving food and warm
libations after the clinic; that will be optional, but if some
of us are stuck waiting for transit or towing, or merely facing
a long cold journey home, fortification will be beneficial.
Verify that they will be open and get taxi coordinates, please!

If the clinic does not come off at Free Geek, I probably can
open my home in Beaverton for three or four really determined
problem solving participants, especially folks coming from a
long distance.  We can make arrangements off line - send 
email please.

   The Lucky Lab is only a couple of blocks away. Beer doesn't freeze and
their food is good.

I have another example of my reply not making it to the list. Here's a 
summary of my experience so far:

Thanks to you all. Your info led me to Google favicon.ico with Google's 
Linux specific search. One of the sites I found told me how to make a 
.ico file from a Gimp image:

http://linuxproblem.org/art_19.html

Another site told me how to tell Apache to use the icon:

http://robert.grefstad.com/linux/apache_favicon.html

So, I created a 16 x 16 image with the GIMP, saved it as  a .pnm file, 
and installed and then ran:

ppmtowinicon -output favicon.ico favicon.pnm

I put a copy in /srv/www, and added a line to /etc/apache2/httpd.conf:

AddType image/x-icon .ico
 
I restarted apache and reloaded my local home page. But, no favicon.

I also tried uploading my favicon.ico to my hosted site. No favicon when 
I go to that site, either.

Any ideas on what step I might have missed?

actually beer is quite content to freeze at around only -7C give or
take a few degrees based on alcohol content (that figure is for 6.2%
ABV homebrew).  a friend just did the calculations today to see if is
kegerator (outside) was in danger of exploding.  he concluded that the
beer wouldn't actually freeze unless it got a lot colder for a lot
longer, but that the beer was already too cold to enjoy straight off
the tap...

Did you add a reference to the favicon in your HTML?

Like this:

<LINK REL="SHORTCUT ICON" HREF="http://www.mysite.com/favicon.ico">


in your index.html file.

Favicons can be a real bear to get loaded.  I'd point your browser
directly at the favicon.ico file itself via URL.  That will make your
browser start paying attention to it.

On my home site I tried:

<LINK REL="SHORTCUT ICON" HREF="favicon.ico">

and on my hosted site I tried:

<link rel="shortcut icon" HREF="http://www.dicksteffens.com/favicon.ico" />


Still no joy on either site.

That works to see the icon in the browser window, and when looking at it 
that way, it shows up next to the URL box, and on the tab. But when I go 
back to the main site, it disappears -- I should say that it is replaced 
by a default icon that Firefox uses.

All this experience has been while viewing the sites with Firefox on my 
Ubuntu machine. However, when I view either site with Firefox or IE from 
my XP laptop the icon appears where it is expected to.

I wondered if Firefox on my Ubuntu machine had to be restarted, so I 
tried that. Now the icon appears where it is supposed to. I'll play with 
it some more to see which of the recommendations needed to be included, 
and then summarize the whole experience.

Has been for a couple of days, and the forecast says it will continue

Gil,

   It was, about 10:00 am. Then it turned to rain. Will probably freeze
tonight so tomorrow's commute to Portland will provide a lot of economic
stinulus as folks slip-slide around.

Heh.  All kidding aside, post-clinic dinnerists are going to be
cold and some will need to be alert for hazardous driving.  Cold
beer may make them drive hazardously.   Most of the Lab's food
is unheated as well, just soup and rice bowls for hot food. 
It is a fine summer hangout, but there are better places to go
when cold.  I only know three or 4 places nearby, of dubious
openness, but I'm sure locals can suggest far more.

Coffee, Tea, Hot Cocoa, Hot Spiced Cider (and microwaved Jolt
Cola) might be the beverages needed.  If Jarra's was open and
served such, then the combination of hot stimulant liquids and
Ethiopian pyro-cuisine might heat the environment sufficiently
to steam the ice off the road.

Your experience is just like mine always is.  It simply takes a lot of
coaxing to get the favicon to start working.  Eventually it will start
working for everyone who visits your site, after enough time has
passed and things fall out of cache.  Not sure why the makers of
modern web browsers find it so important to cache a 16x16 image that
can be delivered in the payload of a single packet.

If you think firefox caches overzealously, try seamonkey.  (This is a
sarcastic remark.)

I would have to install it. but I can't see the bottom of some windows where
you have to click next. is there a way to install via live CD? Probably not.
Someone else says I may be better off with another video card this is more
linux compliant. But this ASUS motherboard has Nvidia Geforce6100 GPU and
nForce 420 MCP chipsets I thought this would work well with Linux.

I could try to install Fedora 10 as blurry as it is but I dont think I can
it installed with the windows so long and you can't resize them.

Well, a teenager is old enough to program a real computer.  Right now,
I'm bidding on an Inspiron 1100 out of Washington with no OS installed.
I'm hoping, unlike my seven other attempts to pick a laptop up at a
decent price, that nobody wants an OSless laptop.  Linux should install
nicely to it.  Bidding $130 is probably low, but by the time I pay
$20 shipping I don't want to go much higher if I don't have to.  Maybe
EBay isn't the best deal around.  It could just be the season.

David,

   If you visit the nVidia web site and download the linux driver for your
card, it installs in text mode. You untar the download and end up with a
file having an extension of .run. For my card I have a file called
NVIDIA-Linux-x86-177.82-pkg1.run. As root, invoke it and an ncurses
interface comes up in the middle of the monitor screen.

   Accept the license, respond appropriately to the other prompts, and it
will be installed for you. Check, using lsmod, and you should see something
like this:

nvidia               6904916  0

   This works for me. If you go this route, keep that *.run file because you
may need to reinstall it each time you reboot the machine. I've no idea why,
but it's a small enough price to pay.

Good luck,

Rich

the: ASUS M2N-MX SE Plus has a Nvidia Geforce 6100 GPU w/ nForce 430 MCP
chipset
should this be able to handle a 19" wide Samsung Monitor?

... the .run file - I shouldn't have to install every time I reboot. I'm
better off getting another video card.

Not to confuse the issue, but you probably should know about this.
The 2.6.28 kernel contains changes that break both nvidia and fglrx
drivers.  Nvivia has a patch; perhaps ati does too.  Testing with vesa
will certainly circumvent this issue.  2.6.28 is super-nosebleed, but
you did mention fedora.

One reason that you might have to rerun the nvidia driver each reboot
is because you might be using a distro kernel, and have no
/lib/modules/`uname -r` directory.  That's where the module goes when
compiled.  Mine is in /lib/modules/2.6.26.7/video/nvidia.ko.  Building
a custom kernel is one way to ensure that all the parts are there.

I ran into the fglrx problem on my Fedora 9 upgrade.  I wanted the flgrx 
driver for dual monitor use.  I found a workaround using the xrandr 
command from Intel.  Read about it at

Check your error log for the actual location the web server is looking 
for the favicon.ico file.  Then place it there and check your 
permissions to allow the web server access.

Heck, if you're gonna spend $150 on something, you might as well get a
$300 new netbook! I wouldn't pay more than $100 for a used piece of gear
including shipping. :)

Hi

Just a very low level question..

I had always believed that when you pinged localhost.. That checked the
TCP/IP stack.. Which means I can do ping localhost even if I have no nic
card installed....

Is that correct??

I don't want to pull my box apart to check it out...<too lazy>

TIA

You want to ping 127.0.0.1 which is the local loopback on the nic

Well, I think you said the magic word loopback....  I do associate
loopback with localhost.. but, does it loopback through the nic or not?


Wondering.

Thanks

No physical NIC is associate with the loopback address. It goes through
a separate logical NIC named "lo", not the "eth0" or "wlan0" associated
with your physical NIC.

Side point - With Linux, when pinging the host's own IP address, even
one that is associated with a physical NIC, the packets do not actually
go though the NIC. The kernel is smart enough to realize that the IP
address is it's own, and it shortcuts the packet's route.

Yes it does. the loopback exists on localhost if a nic is installed.

Thanks for the come back...

This is what I was thinking..
But, I am VERY surprised about the IP address....

So if you want to actually test the nic..

You need to at least ping the gateway or another node???

Thanks

I plugged it into my other 19" Samsung this 1280x1024 res. and it did the
same thing, where its distorted even though it shows the correct resolution.
I think that the AMD X2 4600 cpu doesn't work well the the ASUS mboard that
has the Nvidia GeForce 6100 GPU and nForce 430 chipset. So maybe another
video card is the answer?

See the ethtool(8) man page for info about using it to test an 
ethernet card, e.g.,

# ethtool --test eth0
The test result is FAIL
The test extra info:
Register test  (offline)         0
Eeprom test    (offline)         0
Interrupt test (offline)         0
Loopback test  (offline)         0
Link test   (on/offline)         1

In this case, the test failed because there's no cable connected, so 
the "Link test" returned an error code (1). All 0's is what you want 
to see.

I had to do an ifconfig  and actually look at lo, after you brought it
up, to see it......After ignoring it for years.....


I hate to ask but, is there something similar in Windows??

All operating systems with a TCP/IP stack have some means to support
the loopback IP address of 127.0.0.1 but they don't necessarily implement
it the same way as in Linux. But in no case should it involve or require a
physical NIC. That would be a bug.

How do I install Fedora 10 in safe mode? I was thinking that if I go in as
safe mode I can install and Nvidia drivers that are needed for this mboard.

Some tricks when the video is flaky:

1) Install in text mode - most distros have an option for this.
2) Try a live CD or two.
3) "Control-Alt-F1" for a text screen.  "Control-Alt-F7" back to graphics.
4) "Control-Alt-BS" - back to the login screen 
5) SSH from another machine (if SSHD is running the firewall is off)

The Free Geek store has plenty of older video cards for $5-$20 .
Get 2 or 3, find the varieties that work.

Most of the super-powerful video cards for sale burn a lot of power
to enable you to play video games in high definition with Windows.
If this is not your goal, a garden variety AGP video card will 
probably have all the speed you need for surfing and playing videos.

   I have a domain name in Hong Kong and I want to ensure that my MTA does
not block mail from that domain. I have not been able to identify the IP
address (or address block) for that domain using whois, host, or dig.

   What tool can I use to associate an IP address with that domain name?

Thanks,

So you want to explicitly allow mail from one domain to be accepted by
Postfix?

>    What tool can I use to associate an IP address with that domain name?

You don't need an IP; in fact, it might be counterproductive. Somewhere
before your rejection of Asian IPs (I suspect that's what you have),
allow that domain.

domain.hk	OK

It was looking in the right place, /srv/www, but the first few times I 
had the wrong favicon file referenced. Once I made sure it was 
favicon.ico, and not .gif, or .jpg, things improved.

Anybody who needs to read it ought to be able to so do.

The first try was to see what it was going to look like locally. The 
next effort is to get the owners of the logo to OK taking a piece out of 
it to use for the favicon.ico. There's an obvious part that I cropped 
out of one of the .jpg versions of the company logo, and converted to a 
.ico. I've got that running with the local copy of my hosted web site. I 
sent the tech guru a copy of the .ico, the .jpg, and a screen shot of 
what it will look like and asked him if he can get it approved for 
public use. We'll see how long that takes.

I've noticed. I put a hand drew an "X" in the GIMP and put it up as a 
favicon.ico just to see what it would look like. I've since taken it 
down, but I still get it in my browsers.

lest blame be inequitably distributed or perceived, opera has suffered
favicon wackiness for years as well.  it's mostly working right these
days, but every once in awhile, i still catch icons from a previous
site on a new site i got to thru the previous.

Thanks Keith.

I just installed Fedora 10 from the install DVD at a friends where I was
connected to a 15 viewsonic flat screen and it worked fine. Now I'm back
home and I can't fined the xorg.conf file. I was going to run:
$ gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
and it says it can't find file. Where would it be? I think I need to install
the Nvidia drivers to make it work with my monitor.

Kurt,

   That's what I've done in rhsbl_sender_exceptions. I'm still curious why
whois, or the other tools, did not return an IP address block associated
with that domain.

   'Tis important because I don't want to lose business because messages are
rejected from here. :-)

Thanks,

Rich

I'm curious about that too. The correct tool is 'host'. Can you post the
output of host [domain in question].hk?

wes,

   That's what I thought.

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ host "dongjiang.com.hk"
dongjiang.com.hk mail is handled by 10 mail.dongjiang.com.hk.
dongjiang.com.hk mail is handled by 20 mail2.dongjiang.com.hk.

   Same results without quoting the domain name.

   dig gives me the nameservers ... by name, not IP address

So their domain has MX records defined but no A record.  This isn't that
uncommon.  Of course the MX records you see tell you that those hosts
are where mail goes when sending to them.  Commonly these will be the
same IPs you see coming at you when they're sending you mail, but
there's never any guarantee of this.

Name server records are supposed to give names.  Almost all record types
except for A and AAAA should point to another name.  Eventually all name
chains lead to an IP, but you have to follow that.  For instance:

~> host mail.dongjiang.com.hk.
mail.dongjiang.com.hk has address 220.241.112.97

~> host mail2.dongjiang.com.hk.
mail2.dongjiang.com.hk has address 220.241.112.98

~> host -t ns dongjiang.com.hk
dongjiang.com.hk name server ns8.imsbiz.com.
dongjiang.com.hk name server ns7.imsbiz.com.

~> host ns8.imsbiz.com
ns8.imsbiz.com has address 210.87.250.14

~> host ns7.imsbiz.com
ns7.imsbiz.com has address 210.87.253.2

Actually on Fedora 10, there is no xorg.conf by default.

You can create one by using Xorg -configure.
But it is probably better to use the nvidia settings control panel once the
Nvidia drivers are installed.

   Hmm-m-m. How does one access this settings control panel? I didn't know
such a thing existed.

Yup, no prob.

I should also mention that the whois databases for domain names and IP
addresses are separate.  Domain name whois databases are maintained by
TLD maintainers (I think) and the one for addresses is maintained by
your local RIR (I think).  In any case, if you query for a domain you'll
get something very different than query for the IP pointed to by that
domain, and for good reason.

good luck,
tim

Not that it pertains to this discussion, but in case you're curious, domain
name whois databases are maintained by the TLD maintainers (called the
Registry) except for .com and .net domains. In those cases, the whois
databases are maintained by the individual registrars of the domains.

You are correct in that the IP Address whois databases are maintained by the
RIRs. I had no idea what that was until you mentioned it.

Subject: [PLUG] asus m2n68 and suspend to ram
Message-ID: <200812181725.24845.scratchcomputing@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have an asus m2n68-vm motherboard and I'm running Debian's lenny 
2.6.26-1-amd64 kernel (as well as the nvidia nonfree driver.)  I can 
only get one successful str (echo mem > /sys/power/state) per boot, but 
only if X was running.  Without X running, the screen never goes back 
to the console.  After the first str, any subsequent suspends get to 
the point where the power light flashes, but it immediately snaps out 
of it.

Any suggestions on how to diagnose this or get it working?  Anyone else 
tried this motherboard?

Suspend to disk does seem to work well.  Suspend to "standby" locks it 
up.

Thanks,

I'm looking at buying an ASUS laptop, their model that has the atom cpu
and Xandros Linux installed.

It has an 8.9" screen, 20G solid state hard drive, and I don't remember the
CPU speed.  It is almost a pocket size laptop.

I'm wondering if the 160 gig hard drive option is worth it, solid state is
more reliable arguably.  I'm also wondering about batteries for it, it
is supposed to run 3 h and 45 m on a full charge.  If I go the 160 gig
hard drive route I end up with XP Home and a 10" screen.

I have until tomorrow afternoon to decide.

Personally I'd go with the larger screen, but that's me.  Also, all atom
CPU's I know of run at 1.6 GHz or so.  (single or dual core)

Had a friend build one recently for a gaming rig.  One thing is that you can
not buy a cheap motherboard for these right now.  Second thing is I don't
know why Intel went back to using hyperthreading...  Doesn't make sense to
me.  Didn't they want to move AWAY from that when they went to the Core
achitecture?  Nice thing about 'em is you can stick a crapload of RAM in
those systems.  12 gig must be nice...  If you'd like I can ask my friend if
he had any problems setting up his system hardware-wise.

The onboard video was fine. After installing rpmfusion from rpmfusion.org my
PC rebooted and the screen was automatically configured and sharp and clear.
Fedora 10 is now running smooth and fast. :)

Problem Solved.

You might make it in time for the unadvertised $100.00 discount at
NewEgg.com for the ASUS EEE PC 1000.  $399.00 + S&H.  Ends today.  Try
searching the site for "EEEPC1000-BK003" and see if the promo code
"EMCBCBBBB" works.

I got the tip from technibble.com after missing it in my NewEgg e-flyer.

The EEE 1000 can be gotten locally for the same price after rebate at Iguana 
Micro. It doesn't appear to be on their website, http://www.iguanamicro.com, 
but you can give them a call.

They went back to hyperthreading because it adds (a few) MIPS without
adding significant hardware cost. It's a bitch to model analytically,
but the operating systems, Linux in particular, already know how to
manage it, the design exists, and there are probably some patents that
make it a no-brainer for Intel.

What I don't understand is why Justin Rattner said they'd drop it. He
should have known he couldn't enforce that kind of decision on a large
organization like Intel.

Over the last week or so, some of the e-mail I send to this list 
disappears, while other e-mail gets through. I'm now trying to figure 
out if it's "something I said" in the form of something included that 
some filter doesn't like. So, I'll try sending parts of the e-mail and 
see what survives.

Here's part 1:


I got an e-mail from Comcast this morning. It includes the following:

(I'll skip the quote. Their e-mail told me that they reconfigured my 
cable modem to prevent sending e-mail through port 25. They instructed 
me to switch Thunderbird to port 587.)

Subject: [PLUG] Using Wireshark
Message-ID: <494BF494.1030806@comcast.net>

Since the first part survived, here's the e-mail without the quote from 
Comcast's e-mail.

I got an e-mail from Comcast this morning. It includes the following:

(I'll skip the quote. Their e-mail told me that they reconfigured my 
cable modem to prevent sending e-mail through port 25. They instructed 
me to switch Thunderbird to port 587.)

First thing this morning, I called the Comcast tech support 888 number 
and asked if this sounded like a bogus e-mail; it looked OK to me -- all 
of the links were to comcast.net -- but one never knows these days. He 
said that it was valid, and that port 587 is a valid port for sending 
e-mail through comcast.net.

I also asked if the reason I got it was because it is likely that one of 
my machines is infected with some program that is sending out bogus 
e-mail. He allowed as how that it is likely the case.

So, I changed Thunderbird's outgoing server setting to use port 587, 
tested sending some e-mail, and found that everything works.

Now, I want to figure out what machine -- if any -- in the house is 
causing trouble. I'm assuming I can use Wireshark to watch the traffic 
on the switch to which this machine (Ubuntu) is connected, but that it 
won't be able to look at any other traffic on the other router ports 
(network topology below). I suspect my XP laptop, because it has been 
booting pretty slowly of late, so I'll start with that. If I don't find 
anything, then I'll look into re-configuring my network.

So, now on to setting up and using Wireshark.

I installed it on my Ubuntu Hardy machine using Synaptic. I started the 
program and realized that I have no idea what to do with it. I Googled 
around and found a How-To on the Wireshark site:

http://www.wireless-nets.com/resources/tutorials/sniff_packets_wireshark.html

The first thing it wants me to do is to, "configure Wireshark to 
interface with an 802.11 client device;" or I'll "get an alert 'No 
capture interface selected!'"

When I choose Capture > Interfaces from the Wireshark menu I get a 
window with the title Wireshark: Capture Interfaces. It has a column 
header line that says, Device Description   IP   Packets   Packets/s. 
There is no list of devices below that header line.

Any ideas on what step Synaptic didn't include, or I didn't know I 
needed to do?

TIA.

Here's my network topology:

Cable Modem       -----     Router                 -----  Four Ports
Motorola SB5100           Netgear RT-314

Router Port 1       -----     CNet 8 port switch

Router Port 2       -----     (Mumble) switch (in the basement)

Router Port 3       -----     Brother MFC7820N Fax/Scanner/Printer

Router Port 4       -----     Wife's XP machine.

CNet ports 1, 2, 3 ----- unused

CNet Port 4          -----     Ubuntu machine

CNet Port 5          -----     Thinkpad 600e (Windows 98SE)

CNet Port 6          -----     unused

CNet Port 7          -----     Acer Aspire Laptop (XP)

CNet Port 8          -----     Router

Basement switch -----     Thinkpad 390x (Windows 98SE)
                                        While there are other cables 
connected to this switch,
                                        there currently are no other 
computers connected.

It appears that the quote I tried to include from Comcast's e-mail 
caused the problem, since an e-mail with everything else in it made it.

Here's the text of the quote, without its HTML:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


Dear Comcast High-Speed Internet Subscriber:
Action Taken: In an effort to help prevent spam and ensure the security 
of our network and customers, Comcast has modified your modem?s settings 
to prevent the sending of email on port 25. That is the default port 
email programs such as Outlook Express use to send email. We?ve taken 
this action because we may have detected virus-like activity from your 
modem or received reports from other email providers that mail from your 
modem generated complaints from their users. Please read this message to 
understand how this action may impact your ability to send email and 
what you should do next.
<...>
Email Program Users (Outlook Express, Outlook, MacMail, etc.)
If you use an email program, this action will disable your program?s 
ability to send email until you change your email program settings to 
send email on port 587. Port 587 uses authentication and is an 
industry-recommended alternative to port 25.

I've been eyeing the Lenovo X61 tablet with the XSGA+ (1440x1040)
screen for quite a while, and finally decided to bite the bullet,
but...... it is no longer being made.  Lenovo has dropped production
of the tablet with that screen -- they all run 1024x768 now.

I can get the SXGA+ laptop from Emperor Linux, but I'd be paying a
$900 premium over the lenovo price for the most-comparable tablet (the
only difference is the screen resolution).  Since I'm pretty
indifferent to having a preconfigured vs. personally configured
laptop, I don't want to shell out that much just to have someone
install linux for me -- I *can't* get it built with the UI I want, and
so many things are tied to the desktop managers these days, I'll have
to do a lot of the footwork anyway.

Does anyone know of a good retailer where I could find this machine?
On-line or in Seattle would be ideal, but I come to Portland
frequently too.

Any general suggestions re: wireless adapters / linux tablet-based
input software / etc. are also always welcome :)

Thanks!

In order to sniff a network interface, you typically need root access.
I'm guessing you weren't running it as root and Wireshark didn't show
you the interfaces that you don't have access to (though I could be
wrong).  Running Wireshark as root is a *bad idea* because they're
really not interested in providing a secure product, it seems, and have
had many overflows in the past.

So, I suggest running tcpdump as root (through sudo or otherwise),
storing the output of network traffic, then viewing it as your normal
user (or better yet, a much less privileged user) in wireshark.
Something along the lines of:

# tcpdump -vv -n -i eth0 -s 0 -w packet_capture.cap
...
$ wireshark packet_capture.cap


In this example, "eth0" is the ethernet device you want to sniff and
packet_capture.cap is the file where you'd store the packet capture.

HTH,
tim

If it were me, in your case, I would set up a computer with 2 network cards
and configure it as a gateway, allowing traffic to flow from one interface
to the other. Then I would use Wireshark or TCPDump or another utility (my
favorite is TCPFlows, ymmv) to monitor port 25 and look who's talking.

the downside to this method is that it doesn't allow you to use Wireshark's
built-in methods for overcoming the switch. As he mentioned in the original
post, 1 machine connected to a switch will not be able to see traffic from
another machine connected to the same switch..... unless you use Wireshark
(or something else that supports this) to instruct the switch (via ARP cache
poisoning) to send all traffic to the machine Wireshark is running on.

I consider this method to be "lame" and that's why I use the one I
mentioned: stick a machine in between the router and modem.

(Slaps forehead.) Of course. I suppose part of it is that I'm still not

OK. That worked. I'll have to spend some time figuring out how to use 
filters, but at least I'm on the trail.

I thought of that. I'll have to build a machine, load a version of 
Linux, and give it a try. I think I have enough parts in the basement to 
build a machine with two nics, but it will be a fairly old machine, so 
it probably won't like running the same version of Ubuntu I'm running on 
this machine. I'll have to read up on installing and running without a GUI.

Thanks for the insights.

Hah!  I like the term "instruct".  ARP cache poisoning is typically
considered an exploit, since you're spoofing ARP replies.  I didn't
realize Wireshark now had this feature.

Yes, I didn't even intend to address his network topology.  He clearly
needs to do the sniffing on a box that has access to the packets, and I
too would recommend using a router or even the suspect machine itself.
With the approach I propose, it would be easy to tcpdump on one box and
copy the results over to wireshark, assuming he's using a decent OS for
the sniffing (i.e. not Windows).

Rather than going to the trouble of putting together another machine, 
I'd recommend getting a hub from Free Geek, ebay, etc.  A hub will 
send packets to all ports.  I keep an old 10 Mb hub around just for 
this purpose.

I may still have the old hub from almost 10 years ago. I'll look around

FreeGeek occasionally also has managed switches that (I understand)
can let you dup traffic onto another physical port where you can
listen.  I picked up a couple over the past year for $10-$12 each, 24
port Intel 10/100 managed switch with fiber interfaces as well.

for $10 not a bad deal, just be aware that none of intel's switching
hardware that i ever used (if these are big gray switches, at least
2u, that are kinda loud they are probably the ones) was very good at
traffic above 10Mbps---that is, doing 2x100mbit wirespeed transfers at
once didn't get 200Mbits of throughput and adding more transfers
failed to raise the aggregate throughput numbers.  and the management
s/w was total crap.  felt more like a hub except that the traffic was
still segmented and not broadcast.

then again, maybe they put out a second revision since...wow, 1998ish,
when i was playing with 'em.

I bought my T61 from Computek in Portland. They are an authorized
dealer and Lenovo is all they sell. They're at 1615 SW Jefferson, phone
503-274-4384. I have no idea what they may have in stock, but it's
worth a call.

For what it's worth, I got the same e-mail. And I have only Linux

Well, they did use the words, "may have detected" in their message.

I'll move this to the middle burner -- lower priority for today, but not 
lowest. Maybe I'll figure out the best way to sniff my own network.

If you were interested in running iptables, you could easily log all
packets on a specific port.  If you are interested in going this route, I
can give you my firewall.sh script.  You need kernel support for
netfilter.

Running iptables would only be useful for watching the traffic on the 
machine on which it is running, right? I'm not too concerned that this 
machine, currently the only Linux machine in the house, is the culprit. 
In fact, based on John's reply, I doubt that I have a problem.

Anyway, if I do put together a firewall machine, I'll keep your offer in 
mind.

Thanks.

So the summary is they are preventing your machines from connecting to
port 25 on their machines because they think you are sending spam via
that route.  You would hope they could detect such things quite
reliably so it is probably true. Of course the most probable cause of
this is a  Windows computer infected with one of the prevalent botnet
trojans such as  srizbi.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srizbi_botnet

Windows defender might be able to find and eliminate the problem.
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/defender/default.mspx

Or Zonealarm
http://www.download.com/ZoneAlarm-Firewall-Windows-2000-XP-/3000-10435_4-10039884.html
might block the outgoing packets and give you some idea of which
program is trying to make the outgoing connection.

Carlos,

   A very rational decision. We'll see you after spring thaw. My wishes for a
happy and safe holiday season to all of you.

It would also be useful if you used a hub in between the router and modem,
and connected 1 port to a machine you could listen with.

Darn.  I would fly the business jet out to pick you up, but
it is currently in the shop with a bad case of imaginary.  :-)
Stay warm and safe - we'll see you in the spring.

We are crawling our way towards a swappable hard drive setup at the
clinic, so people can bring in their drives rather than their whole
machines.  We have fixed a few problems remotely with ssh login. 

But many problems require full network access.  One solution to that
is a "VPN terminal in a box" that taps your network and connects to a
service organization at the far end, but for now that is a lot of ad
hoc effort to set up with something like OpenWRT programmed into a
repurposed wireless access point or very small computer.  In the
nearer term, it will be easier to just install OpenVPN on one of
your computers, and connect to a port at our end.  Not yet.

You are having problems with networking, IIRC (setting up wpa, right?),
and working the client end of a wireless link via a VPN is difficult. 
Maybe in a few years we will have more experience or tools for that.

For now, perhaps we can work through some of your problems via the
list.  Keep in mind that you can set up secure communications with
temporary passwords, get things working with our help, then replace
the keys and passwords and IP address ranges when we are done.  As
long as there is no network connection at the time you are making
the experiments, and you return things to a more secure state before
you reconnect, you can keep the security risks low.

Which model number was that?  There are lots of different Lenovo
X61s for sale via Google Shopping, eBay, etc.  When I did a search
on Google Shopping for "Lenovo X61 Tablet Thinkpad 1400 1050" I
got some hits, though nothing relevant for 1440.   

With the 4 digit model number (i.e. 7762 ) you can look in lots
more places.  The Lenovo Outlet Store has lots of inexpensive
X61 tablets, some with undefined screen resolutions.  Given
the model number, that is where I would look first.  There are
some highly rated stores on the lists, but that doesn't mean 
their laptops are good specimens, compared to the manufacturer.


Perhaps irrelevant to your quest, I personally prefer 1Kx768
screens - until they start making 2Kx1.5Ks.  I can fit two
80 character xterms with 5x9 fonts across a 1024 pixel screen.
The fonts look crummy until you get up to 9x15 characters, 
IMHO.  But then, most of you have better eyes than I do, so
you can see xterms with itsy bitsy characters.  1024x seems
to be the sweet spot for many websites, too.

Thanks!  I haven't found the model number, but I was able to find one
(exactly one, in fact) tablet with an SXGA+ screen, and at a pretty
fantastic price too :).  No bluetooth, but I can live without that if
it isn't possible to add later.

Thanks again for the pointer -- I'd never heard of the lenovo outlet.
Definitely a place to keep in mind.

That won't tell you which machine it is though, because between the
modem and router all the clients with have the public ipaddr,
presuming that NAT'ing occurs at the router.

I will have to see if I have it Dick but I used to run something
called Sniffer Pro on windows boxes that could find all hosts on the
network and identify how much and what type of traffic was coming from
it. It would save you the hassle of setting up a sniffer box or
finding a switch capable of port mirroring :)

In linux, I've used ether-ape with pretty good luck for a graphical

You could filter the results by MAC address (a Layer 2 filter) by
using a filter expression like:

ether host 00:03:0d:10:f3:20

It suprised me to learn this, because every filter I have ever used in
the past was a Layer 3 filter (ex. 'tcp port 25').  I figured you
would have to do something extra to tell wireshark to look at a
completely different packet header.  Bt apparently not; it's smarter
than that.

If you were filtering on tcp port 25, even without a MAC filter, you
would see the offending packets, and could determine their owner by
the MAC address.  Therefore, a filter like 'tcp port 25' would yield
usable results, even if the IP address weren't useful.

Richard, thanks for your kind words.  I'll try to do you proud by
staying alive this holiday season.

I'll start a new thread on the wpa topic, and explain where things
stand at the moment.  In a nutshell: with the madwifi driver, it works
but keeps disconnecting and reconnecting.  With the kernel ath5k
driver, it doesn't work at all.  I get errors like "noise floor
calibration failed".  I tested with the stable vanilla kernel, the
testing kernel, and the git kernel.  But let's put this in a new
thread.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0812200825400.1511@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I tried to print a displayed web page this morning and nothing happened.
When I tried running lpq (both as user and as root) I see 'lpq: Unable to
connect to server.' When I print to a file and attempt to print the .ps
file, I am told that lpr failed. However, a few pages that my wife sent to
the print spool last night did come out when I turned on the printer.

   Looking at the CUPS bui (localhost:631/admin) shows all printer
definitions waiting for jobs, but the job queue is empty. Tried stopping and
restarting CUPS, but that made no difference.

   /var/log/cups/error_log shows no errors; at least, they don't look to me
like errors:

For some reason my laptop (Lenovo T61) does not sync its clock with the
internet servers. At the moment it has been up for a couple of weeks
and it is over one minute slow. My desktop uses the same settings and
it always displays the time correctly. Both are Intrepid x86_64. I know
the desktop is accurate because I compare it with an atomic clock that
is refreshed daily with the broadcast from Fort Collins, CO.

The GUI stuff is not helping - that is, both computers show the same
settings. I need to figure out some command line stuff to sleuth it
out, but I have no idea where to start.

I don't do anything with my computers that requires accuracy any closer
than getting me to class on time. It's just annoying. I use Linux. My
computers should be perfect.

   Set up your noteboot to use ntp with the desktop as the local server.

I set up /srv/www to be document root for apache2 on my home machine. It

strictly internal -- it's not seen in the Internet.

Using the GUI file browser (is that Nautilus in Ubunty?) When I right 
click on a file I want to delete, then click on "Move to Trash," I get 
an error message that says, "Cannot move file to trash, do you want to

Uh.  The macaddr you see between the router and the modem will be the
macaddr of the router or modem (or, presuming it is bridging, the
upstream devices).  MAC addresses don't survive routing because they
are local to each link.  If you want to see your local hosts, their
macaddrs and ipaddrs, you need to be on the inside side of your
router.

I have not yet figured out the correct solution to this either. I've been
setting up ntpdate commands in root's crontab on all my servers. here's an
example:

0 * * * * /usr/sbin/ntpdate time.mit.edu > /dev/null

this syncs it up every hour.

It'll get him that much closer, and be easier than setting up an individual

Look at the 'Services' tab and check 'Hide All Microsoft Services', then 
look for anything suspicious. Then look at the Startup tab, which will 
show you all items running at login. Again, look for anything 
suspicious. If you want a more verbose 'msconfig', use this:

http://live.sysinternals.com/autoruns.exe

Also, at the command line, you can issue 'netstat' commands to see 
active connections. An alternative to netstat is here:

http://live.sysinternals.com/Tcpview.exe

If your AV is up to date and hasn't indicated any problems, you could 
try uninstalling it and try another brand as a test. AVG, Avast and 
AntiVir are all free for home use and many more with free trials that 
would work.

If none of this shows anything, you can try running this to detect rootkits:

http://live.sysinternals.com/RootkitRevealer.exe

If it find anything at all that you know is not right, then it's time to 
reinstall the OS. All the above could be done inside of 20 minutes 
unless your machine is an older slower model. I noticed you have a 
couple Win98 machines too. You let them loose on the web?

This gave me an inspiration and may have led me closer to a solution. 

First, I went into the System > Administration > Time and Date GUI and
discovered that I can put a tick mark in more than one server. So I
added a couple more. But time.mit.edu was not on the preordained list,
so I used the box in the bottom of the window to add it. Unfortunately,
when I clicked on Add it did nothing. Nevertheless, I now have three
servers checked, and I could add more.

Then from the command line I did this:

jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo /usr/sbin/ntpdate
[sudo] password for jjj: 
20 Dec 11:34:20 ntpdate[759]: no servers can be used, exiting

So the reason it is not updating is that it cannot find the servers. At
least I now know that it is set to use NTP servers. 

So then I went back to the GUI and put a tick mark in every server in
the US - 13 in all. Again I gave the update command, and again I got
the error message that no servers can be used.

Then I tried your command again, adding time.mit.edu, and got:

jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo /usr/sbin/ntpdate time.mit.edu
20 Dec 11:48:18 ntpdate[1386]: the NTP socket is in use, exiting

I don't know what that means. 

I could try Rich's suggest to set it to the deskop, but I doubt it
would work either. If it can't find 13 NTP servers because the NTP
socket is in use, it probably won't find the desktop either.

Subject: [PLUG] Disallow raid assembly with missing device?
Message-ID: <200812201230.07858.aaron@madebyai.com>

I've got a non-critical box running raid5 where two drives are external, one 
USB and one eSATA. Occasionally for some reason one or the other is not 
detected at boot time, and the kernel will autodetect and assemble the array 
in degraded state missing one drive. This requires the whole array to be 
regenerated, which is quite time consuming.

Is there a way to force the kernel to NOT assemble an array that's missing 
disks at boot time? The raid456 module is compiled into the kernel because 
this raid array is the root filesystem. I'm not using an initrd and want to 
avoid doing so because that's a nuisance.

Kernel version 2.6.27, if it matters.

TIA,
Aaron

It probably means you're running a NTP server. If you're going to use
cron to keep your date in sync, you don't need the server. Use rcconf to
turn it off.

Also/alternatively, you can add the '-u' option to your 'ntpdate'
command line. Another useful trick is to use the pool.ntp.org name,
which spreads the time load over many servers.

My T61 has clock problems also...

ntpdate -u pool.ntp.org
20 Dec 12:55:53 ntpdate[30934]: step time server 209.132.176.4 offset

Keith, JJJ

Are we still seriously considering running the Clinic tomorrow?
My weather report shows freezing rain for the afternoon on Sunday.

Keith, you have to go over the Sylvan pass and John takes public
transportation.

Will FreeGeek be open as previously thought?

Just asking.

Assuming you're using mdadm (Linux software RAID) I think this can be
configured with the Auto-detect options in the /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf
file. I don't know exactly how to do it, however. While I generally
bitch about man files, man mdadm is pretty good.

Yeah, the system is Linux softwre RAID. However, mdadm is just a "control" 
application, if you will. It tells the kernel what to do. The kernel is what 
handles the RAID array, long before the system init scripts start running.

I've checked the kernel documentation, and the only commandline argument I've 
discovered for the entire md subystem is start_dirty_degraded, which only 
applies to an array that is both dirty and degraded. Mine is just degraded 
with a missing disk, and that's what i need to have halt a boot process.

I usually drive because I have a big box of stuff that I bring in
addition to my computer. But I can get everything essential into my
backpack and it's only four blocks from my house to the bus stop. I
just have to leave early enough - TriMet says 11:36 in order to arrive
by 12:30, and that assumes things are running anywhere close to
schedules - not a likelihood. But not to worry, I'll make it.

> Will FreeGeek be open as previously thought?

I have no idea. I tried calling just now (503-232-9350) but all I can
get is a busy signal.

I finally got through to the Thrift Store. 

It turns out that the idea of being open tomorrow was discussed but
eventually rejected. Unfortunately, some people were told that they
would be open (evidently, including us) and a follow-up to correct the
fact was not made. 

The fellow I spoke with asked how I heard of it. "Aha!" was his
response, realizing that we were not among those informed of the change
in plans. I told him I would inform the list that the Thrift Store will
NOT be open tomorrow, and wasn't planning to in the first place.

But the Clinic is going on unless we die trying to get there.

Well, there are several things listed as Manufacturer: unknown. I'll 
have to Google them and see what they do. I remember going through this 
the first time I used msconfig over 10 years ago. There is a long list 
of things, some of which are obvious, some of which aren't, but turn out 
to be necessary. Google will be my friend.

After a fresh re-boot there are just two entries, and they look circular:

Proto  Local Address         Foreign Address     State

Not often. Most of the time they just sit there with their lids closed. 
One is in the kitchen and the other in the living room. When I do use 
them, it's usually to listen to 
http://www.allclassical.org/pages/programs_listen.php5 or a .mp3 in my 
own collection. Very occasionally, I will Google something. They're both 
old enough that their hardware won't support today's OSs. Fortunately, 
Firefox still runs on them.



Thanks for all the info. As I said yesterday, I suspect this is much ado 
about nothing. John mentioned getting the same notice from Comcast that 
I got, and which started my thinking there might be a problem. The key 
phrase in Comcast's message is, "...we MAY have detected virus-like 
activity from your modem..." My guess is that there really isn't any 
suspicious activity coming from my modem, but that they are switching to 
port 587 on general principles.

On the other hand, the laptop takes longer to boot up that it used to. 
That may be caused by a number of programs I installed but no longer 
use. I'll take the opportunity to clear those out one of these days, and 
the tools you told or reminded me of will come in handy.

Thanks to all for all the advice. For now, I'm going to move on to other 
work.

I'm not planning on dying - 4 wheel drive with 4 chained wheels,
relatively flat routes.  I go via Multnomah and Barbur on snow days,
low but circuitous.  The biggest risk is the other idiots out there.  

If anyone wants to get to my house in Beaverton by 11AM, they can
make the trek with me.  If we have dinner in Portland afterwards,
the return time is indeterminate.  Let me know soon.  Dress warm.

I plan to bring some faster/longer swap trays, some USB wireless
dongles that work, a power meter, and my ALIX board.   Any other
toys I should bring?

Well, I do.  The question is, is there an equivalent to the procon

Unfortunately, searching for a plugin is difficult because procon is

For those who don't know, the procon plugin is a porn filter for

I got one of the ASUS EEE PCs and like it.  Boots quickly.  The Xantros 
distribution which is a Debian derivative.  I added the debian 
repositories to get some of the programs I wanted.  They have the 
distribution tied down tightly.  They have gui interfaces for most 
everything they want you to do, but since it is a debian 
distrotribution, apt-get with the additional repositories specified will 
get you almost anything you want.

It is specific to Firefox. It was created by a group in the Mozilla
organization, so it's unlikely they would port it to the dark side.

But I'm pretty sure there are equivalents for Internet Explorer.
Googling on "porn" should bring up a few pages. :)

IE 7 has *lots* of protective capabilites built in, and more are
available if you install one of the major protection suites, like McAfee
or Norton. If that's not enough, you could check out some of the gizmos
that large IT organizations use to protect their users and protect their
infrastructure from their users.

IE 7 with the default Internet security/privacy/parental controls, etc.
settings is pretty paranoid. About the only thing it doesn't protect you
from is Microsoft coding errors. :)

I was out to Beaverton today, in the teeth of the "storm".  And yes,
it snowed the whole time I was there, and yes there was some freezing
wiper problems, but with good chains on the beater honda, it was a
piece of cake.  And yes, the biggest danger was certainly the _other_
idiots.  My mother was rather emphatic that I could be included among
them merely for venturing out, however having been present for the
entire trip I can say that it wasn't very scary.  Just took it easy
and watched out for the other idiots.

Now that I've got the chains on, I'm going to try to make it to the
clinic tomorrow as well.

You can use something like openDNS as the DNS service and if you

No, but maybe a dinner party ...

Totally off topic:  someday I want someone to make a musical about the
Donner party.  I'm imagining Alferd Packer singing with his next meal. 
"Sing if you're supper" would be one of the tunes.   And of course, a
slightly modified version of the Barbra Streisand showpiece:  "People,
who eat people, are the hungriest people, in the world."

At the Clinic, we will stick to cookies and Penguinos.  If Ubuntu has
a meal planning software package for anthrophages, we are NOT helping
you install it.

BTW, I will be bringing a snow shovel.  My biggest concern is that
the door might be frozen shut.  Any suggestions for unfreezing a
metal door?

A bottle or two of de-icer, a propane blowtorch, (not to be used together
due to de-icer being alcohol which burns,) (don't wanna burn the whole place
down).  Also, if you heat the metal door too fast and it has a glass inlay
then it'll crack or break the glass potentially.  Another option is a
heat-gun or hot-air-reflow station hooked to whatever source of power you
can find.  Just heat the perimeter until it releases.  Maybe bring a small
generator just in case?

Oh, and a 1000+ watt inverter would be useful for power to a heat gun just
as easily given you have an extension cord or can drive up to the door, but
depending on the capacity of your car battery, you may wish to leave your
car running so as to keep it from draining completely.  I had to unfreeze my
car doors by using a heat gun the other day actually.  Works quite well, so
long as you are patient.

I am trying to compile ipxripd on Fedora Core 3 according to the IPX-HOWTO.

I am getting indications that there is something wrong with

Not sure much on the IPX issue, but is there a particular reason you are
using Fedora Core 3 still, which is WAAYY beyond EOL?

Could be the version of the includes with FC3 is too outdated for the
version of ipxripd you downloaded?

If you want a longer term RH based distro you should try CentOS, Fedora is
for bleeding edge geeks (like me :) ).

IMHO, YMMV, etc.

I'm going to get rid of Fedora Core 3 as soon as I have another hard drive

There is no /usr/include/ndbm.h on CentOS 5.2 and Fedora Core 3...

The mars_nwe latest version I can find won't compile saying my Linux

Ah, xsnow.  I've been running that since I first saw X11 in 1992.
That was right after xfishtank and oneko.  Every year, I turn it on
before I go to bed on xmas eve to entertain the whole family.

I have no idea about an RPM.  You can probably build it from source:

so you may wish to investigate using ntpd some more.

I don't usually bother replying to GUI-related questions (because I am
clueless) but since no one else has...

I would start by comparing the state of files in each location. Is there an
ownership or permissions issue that gets resolved by moving them to your
home directory?

What if you create a file in /srv/www? Can you then move it to the Trash?

If nothing jumps out at us there, we will have to find some way to determine
the underlying operation that the "Move To Trash" command executes. It
probably relies on regular system utilities to do the work, so it probably
just runs something like "mv /srv/www/file /var/Trash" or the like. Once we
can determine what it's doing, we can then begin to determine why it can't
do it.

Try feeding the URL for the page(s) in "languages other than English" 
into the utility at <http://babelfish.yahoo.com/>??  Not sure that will

Well, I speak a few languages, and I'm snowed in without a lot better
to do, so I figured I'd take a look.

I saw a bunch of english pages show up. I just copied and pasted the
quoted part of your message.

I found this page: https://bugs.launchpad.net/glib/+bug/192629

It looks relevant. Says it is normal behavior if you don't have
exclusive permissions on the drive. (I don't know exactly what that
means or how to find out if you do or don't. Although it sounds a
little self-explanatory.)

There's also this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=703046

My google search on
/usr/include/ndbm.h linux

points to the fact that this file has been replaced as of glibc2.1 and above.
Second you will need glibc-dev package installed on your system to
even find the replacement file.

You have to use ntpdate prior to starting the ntpd process.

The last Fedora to have xsnow was Fedora Core 3. It appears to have been
dropped in the switch from XFree86 to xorg-x11. 

The source RPM is here:

http://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/core/3/SRPMS/xsnow-1.42-15.src.rpm

I tried rebuilding on CentOS 5.2 using this command:

   rpmbuild --nodeps --rebuild xsnow-1.42-15.src.rpm

The "--nodeps" is required because of XFree86-devel (replaced by equivalent
xorg-x11 packages). Still that was not enough. I got errors because the rpmlib
is too new.

As was suggested already, I think building from source is the best bet.

The only other RPM option I can see is to try rebuilding from a source RPM 
from a non-redhat-ish distribution. According to rpmseek.com xsnow was
distributed with OpenSuSE as late as 10.2.

It is 1255pm at the Clinic at Free Geek.  It is warm, dry, and

The snow is 6 inches deep with a 1 inch ice crust.  The Clinic
sign is on a mound of snow shovelled from the front of the door.

A friend got an Eee PC, is a Linux noob and want's to learn about 
Linux.  He would like to unlock some of the sysadmin functions of the 
Xandros desktop, but needs some explicit directions.  Has anyone done that?

The radar is showing another ice storm moving in, and the Winter Storm  
Warning has been extended to 10 AM tomorrow. :(

But I have electricity and food and the Internet and AllClassical.org.

Gang,

I think we need some level of security on
http://www.pdxlinux.org/wiki/LinuxClinic

If you go to the tab "RecentChanges" there are a bunch entries from China.
Most of the entries make not sense to me, some my contain hacking info.
In any case, they are taking up our disk space on the server for  the Wiki.

Wiki's need a community of users above all.  Captcha can help.  But if
no one is actively using the wiki, then it probably ought to be
unplugged.

We could possibly restrict posting to the Wiki to email addresses registered

Just a thought.

Hi all,  so I lost power for a couple hours today, and my laptop was on
during the outage.  I shut it down, plugged it in, and waited until the
power came back to use it again.  Since then the power has come back on,
however the laptop will no longer POST, and the power light flashes.  This
has never happened before, (light flashing or no POST condition,) and seems
to be unaffected by being on wall power or not, with or without the battery
installed.  If anyone has any thoughts on what could cause this sort of
situation, please let me know.

It sounds like you may have done this, but have you done the old trick of:

Remove battery
Unplug AC
Wait 10-15 seconds
Plug in AC
Try to power up
Replace battery

?

Or, leave it plugged in, make sure charging light is on (sounds like it may
be charging, with the light flashing),
let battery charge up for a while (10-15 minutes at least), and then try
again.  If the battery is completely dead, some laptops won't power up at
all, regardless of AC plugged in or not.  As long as you are getting some
light activity there is a good chance you can resurrect it.

Battery was not dead upon shutdown.  On the contrary; it was at 90+ %.
Charging light is separate from power light.

At this point I'm almost suspecting a component failure on the motherboard.
I can do surface-mount soldering, but lack the knowledge to diagnose the
circuits to find the faulty components.  If this is what it sounds like,
I'll have to bring 'er in to the next PLUG workshop to see if someone can
help me repair it.

Just thought of something...  I'll leave the battery out overnight and the
laptop unplugged in case of weird stuff that may have happened, and in the
morning if it doesn't start up I'll pop out the CMOS backup battery to reset
the CMOS so long as it isn't dangerous.  If anyone has any thoughts or
warnings, please let me know.

I went through something like this a couple of months ago on my ancient
Compaq Presario 2110US. It was running fine on AC but the charge light
flashed yellow. I went on line and did a search and it said, "Dead
Battery". So I bought a new battery and it now works. So before you
throw in the towel, search for your symptoms on the vendor's support
site. It might just be a dead battery.

P.S. On mine, the light is green when fully charged, *solid* yellow when
charging and flashing yellow when there is a dead battery. I forget what
the symptom is if the charging circuit is fried.

I had a similar problem...

turned out to be HP's problem. Their fixing it for free even though it's
not under warranty. Thought this might give you another place to look.
Check the manufacturers website and see if they have anything posted
about your problem.

Sounds pretty fried to me, was it plugged into a surge protector when 
the power went out?

One thing that's happened to me before during a surge (via what I now
think was a defective suppressor) is that the battery went from 100% to
completely drained.

It took charging to some level (above 10%, but I'm not sure, as it was a
couple of years ago) before the laptop would start again. And I'm still
using that same laptop today.

Thanks,
Mike

Is it possible that the makefiles are in DOS format?  This would cause
this type of problem.

If not then there is a syntax or spacing error on line 89 of your
makefile which without the contents of the file no one is going to be
able to help you.

That may be the answer.

When I went to the Clinic today and restarted the computer I noticed
that it was back at correct time. (I never bothered to change it
manually before.) Of course, the ntpd process was not running during
boot.

However, there is one small issue that still does not make sense. When
I booted at the Clinic I was not connected by ethernet. I waited until
the computer finished booting (Intrepid x86_64), then connected to Free
Geek's wireless, and then opened a browser to click "yes I accept" the
Free Geek terms of service, and only then was I completely connected.

Surely by the time all that happened the ntpd service had already
started. Or maybe it doesn't start until there is a connection?

Thing is, I've replaced the battery within the last 6 months, it's a PIII 1
GHZ system, (but has firewire!), and the RAM maxes out at 512 MB, so ...5+
years old-ish? and made by Sager.  (Clevo makes stuff for Sager and
Alienware).  Got the laptop for free about 6 months ago, and I don't have
the money to replace it.  It was not plugged into an kind of surge
suppression system, and worked fine on battery when the power went out.  It
was probably a surge when the power came back that did it.  It's weird
though, it does in fact turn on, but normally when it powers on the cooling
fan runs full speed for a second before POST.  Now it just turns on at
lowest speed, and the CD drive constantly seeks...

Here's my little laptop hardware story:

I had a recent experience with my even older Compaq Presario (an
1800T).  No video.  No cursor, no backlight, nothing.  I often get a
long beep, two short beeps during POST.  I was stunned recently to
discover that it was *actually* booting up okay.  It dual-boots w2k
and linux, and when I got it booting linux and I let it boot, I could
ssh in over the network and everything was fine.  Except, that is,
that lspci didn't show the video adapter.  Oops.

While I was looking for a nearby repair depot, I found HP's
diagnostics site.  The last step before sending it in for evaluation
was to reseat the memory.  I did that and *boom* it worked.  For a
little while.  The memory trick isn't working any more, and it's going
in on the first day the place is open (damned weather!).

The first thing to check is whether the AC adapter produces the
right voltage.  It is difficult for a power line upset "reach
through" the AC adapter and zap the laptop.  If it somehow did,
it is even more unlikely for the adapter to produce normal
voltage afterwards.  There is a lot of power regulating circuitry
in most laptop adapters, and I would expect that to blow first.

However, what CAN happen is that the line power can bounce on and
off in the wrong way, the output of a poorly designed adapter can 
bounce up and down with it, and this can stress the power input
circuitry of the laptop, wreaking havoc.  This should not happen
with well designed power hardware.  Sadly, at most places I know
about the power supply is where they save pennies on components,
and save salary cost by hiring second rate engineers.  Power
supply behavior under funny line conditions is a not banner spec
or a driver of purchasing decisions.  I have seen two battery
charging circuits fail on 1997-era laptops, necessitating depot
level repair.  IBM was great for these fixes, Levono not so 
much, Dell used to suck horribly.  But things change.

If it is a zorched power supply on the laptop motherboard, the
whole motherboard will need replacing.  You will have a hard
time isolating and identifying the blown semiconductor (s),
figuring out the part number, and finding a replacement for sale
somewhere, because they probably don't manufacture it anymore.

That said, Google is your friend.  Look to see if others have
had the problem with your model number.  And eBay is your friend;
a lot of people break screens and other components that aren't
the motherboard, so you can usually find used replacements cheap.

My bet on the broken component is (1) AC adapter, (2) battery,
(3) motherboard.  It helps to have spares for (1) and (2) anyway.

Ugh...  Not exactly the news I was hoping for, but I've already popped out
the battery, put it back, popped it out AND the CMOS battery, replaced them,
reseated the RAM, and a host of other things, and still nothing.  I'll have
to wait until tomorrow to verify that it's not mysteriously fixed itself and
then strip it down to the motherboard to try to isolate the problem.
...Noone's ever heard of a CPU frying due to power fluctuations, have they?
(It's the only other easily-replaceable component in the system, and
although 1 GHZ P3's are rare, it's not the end of the world if that's what
blew.)

Oops... another power outage.  Thank god for UPS's.

We had a very small clinic Sunday.  5 of us.  We got Ubuntu mostly
installed on an EEE PC, though there were still some network 
driver problems (a USB ethernet dongle came in handy).  A few
more small accomplishments.  

Getting home was "interesting".  One of the attendees was without
chains.  About 4 more inches of snow arrived while we were doing
the clinic.  With lots of scraping and shovelling, and a spare
set of too-small chains we got the chainless car launched.

A few of us had dinner after the Clinic at Thai Spoons over on
Hawthorne.  Nearly everything else was closed.  Cannibalism was
not required.

Which makes it even more likely that there was a permissions change of some
kind. My suggestion stands.

Keith,

   Are you certain? What did you eat there? Is Thai Spoons a spin-off of
Typhoon?

Subject: [PLUG] TimeVault
Message-ID: <20081222174645.740defa6.johnxj@comcast.net>

For a long time I have been searching for a backup utility that a brand
new Linux user can handle. That means no manual command line, no cron
jobs, no scripts - and GUI all the way. The GUI can be a front end to
those tools, but if we want to get desktop users away from Windows and
into Linux we have to supply them with something they can understand.
(Y'all who think Linux should never be on the desktop can stop reading
now.)  :)

I may have found it. TimeVault is a project that is under development
to provide a utility for Linux users that is very close to Apple's Time
Machine. Unfortunately, it is still under development. Moreover, it
appears that it started as a tool to be integrated into the Gnome
desktop (e.g. Nautilus), but the past several months have been devoted
to creating a KDE version as well. Thus, the core utilities have not
been worked on lately. Here are some links:

http://www.howtoforge.com/snapshot-backups-with-timevault-ubuntu-7.10
https://launchpad.net/timevault
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeVault

Even if it's not close to release I'd like to try out the latest
version. However, there is no 64-bit .deb for my Ubuntu x86_64
computers, and the source that is available is for version 7.2, several
months old. I have read Ubuntu forum posts where people have installed
the 32-bit .debs with --force-architechture, and I may give that a
shot, just to take it for a spin.

Meantime, I'm also investigating rsnapshot, a dirvish-like utility
whose documentation I can actually almost understand.

I'm running Ubuntu on a laptop maxed out with 512 MB of RAM.  The biggest
consumer I have appears to be firefox.  Now the system is nicely responsive,
just wondering if there are any smaller-footprint browsers out there I might
be able to try, preferrably with tab support.  Any suggestions welcome.

Ok, turns out it just had some weird state in the CMOS.  Re-popped the CMOS
battery, shorted the contacts on the holder this time to discharge any
capacitance, and reassembled.  The whole thing worked, more or less, and
boots just fine now.  Only issue I have now is that the system does not
detect when the lid is closed anymore.  It worked before, so I'm guessing
there's some BIOS setting that affects it.  Anyways, thanks for all your
advice.  Really glad it wasn't fried, and next power outage I'm unplugging
it and all my other valuable unprotected-by-UPS electronics.

make is notoriously finicky about Makefile syntax.  Most likely there is 
something make doesn't like on line 89.  The #1 Makefile error is that the 
first line of a target description (and maybe all lines of the 
description, don't remember at the moment) MUST MUST MUST start with a tab 
character.

Seamonkey is the bloatware Mozilla version of the old Netscape 
Communicator all-in-one tool. I don't think it fits the bill here.  
Opera has also grown in size with new features, but may be smaller than 
firefox, I haven't checked.

Lynx?

How about grabbing the Firefox browser from a DSL build, since 
everything in DSL has been memory trimmed to fit on a 50MB credit card 
CD, and run in 128MB of RAM, it's probably the smallest footprint 
browser available, besides Lynx that is.

opera and firefox seem to be swelling at about the same rate for me
these days.  i'd look at google chrome and konqueror for size
comparisons...don't have them installed to do a test.  they both
support tabs as well.

on a fresh start with the same 7 tabs, opera is smaller, but it grows
quickly.  i never use firefox for long enough to find out if it does,
too.

(relevant columns are 5/6 which show total memory/in-core size.)

Have you tried konqueror?  There's also a new crop of webkit-based 
browsers (e.g. arora.)

You might try Midori.  It's a nice looking browser, and does do tabs.
I just tried it alongside Firefox, and Midori wins the
low-memory-footprint contest hands down, with Firefox weighing in at
69.4MB and Midori at 22.1MB.  (Measured with the Gnome System Monitor
running on Fedora 10.)

A fairly complete listing of browsers with a brief description can be found
at http://www.helgefjell.de/browser.php

Minimo is intriguing..

The Minimo (Mini Mozilla) project is focused on code-size and runtime
footprint reduction, and porting to small consumer devices. The primary
focus of Minimo to date has been system with ~32-64 MB of RAM, running Linux
and using the GTK toolkit. Other platforms and toolkits have been
investigated as well.

The old Netscape is the bloatware AOL version of the old Mozilla Suite, 
not the other way around. The Suite/Seamonkey have a smaller memory 
footprint with mail and the browser open with several tabs than FF alone 
with a few tabs of the same sites open.

I would suggest making sure there aren't a bunch of plugins installed, 
as that is the primary reason for FF weirdness. Or try Opera.

While we are on the subject of measuring Linux memory usage, two
not-so-subtle points:

1. Kernels from 2.6.25 to the present have better process memory usage
measurement capabilities than those up through 2.6.24. See

http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_25#head-5a75e29195ffa59bfa5428ca28702e2e7df8f2ad
http://lwn.net/Articles/230975/

2. With any kernel, you need to account for shared memory, libraries,
etc., to properly assess the memory required by an application. The tool
that does this is in the "procps" package and is called "pmap". See

Ed,

   Thank you. I was not aware of pmap before ... or I completely forgot about
it.

   Germane to this thread, how would I apply pmap to determine the memory
used by firefox when I have these three processes running?

  9484 ?        S      0:00 /bin/sh /usr/bin/firefox
  9496 ?        S      0:00 /bin/sh /usr/lib/firefox-2.0.0.20/run-mozilla.sh /usr
  9501 ?        Sl     4:20 /usr/lib/firefox-2.0.0.20/firefox-bin

   Do I measure only 9484? Add the results of all three?

Thanks,

Rich

those first two should be noise in comparison to the third, which is
the money shot.  if 1+2 are very large, something strange is afoot.  i
guess for a scientific result, 1+2+3 is the way to go, though.

Chris,

   OK. That produces a result of 4284K. Is this considered large by today's
standards?

compared to firefox?  you be the judge.  my firefox starts at around
150Mbytes in RAM.  i think 2 orders of magnitude difference is pretty
substantial, meaning the small is unimportant in light of the large.
but hey, that's just my opinion.

another point:  before measuring, you'll want to open pages in as many
tabs as you use to produce an accurate reflection of reality.

opera continues to grow after long-term use (more than a day), about
doubling in size before it levels out, so it would be interesting to
track the size data over the course of your typical "session" (mine's
about 4 weeks long at work, and 4-48 hours long at home).  those first
two shell processes should not ever increase in size, since their work
is done by the time the browser starts.

Message-ID: <20081223201049.GB7342@gate.kl-ic.com>


It's been a year since I looked at it, but at that time one
of the largest memory hogs for a browser was flash animation. 
The Adobe Flash plugin is closed source, and behaves badly -
it just keeps grabbing memory and not letting go of it.  Also,
it seems to ask X to allocate memory for it, and doesn't tell
X when it is done with the memory.  So, if you leave a browser
running on a page with flash animation,  Adobe Flash will
slowly grab all your RAM.

That was a year ago - perhaps things are much better now, and
perhaps gnash is working better than Adobe flash and I should
switch to that.  For now, I run with 2GB of RAM, kill firefox
every few days, and restart X every couple of weeks.  It
amazes me that firefox takes up so much room, yet still lacks
heuristics to render badly-M$-centric pages usably.

One of the links covers that, but essentially every thread has two types
of RAM that it is using -- RAM that it shares with one or more other
threads and RAM that is unique to it. Towards the bottom of one of the
pmap displays for each thread -- I forget whether it is -x or -d --
there is a total of the shared and unique RAM. So, you count the shared
RAM once and add the unique RAM for all of the processes.

Things are partially better on 64-bit systems, but as of openSUSE 11.1
(five days ago) the "state of the art" is still "nspluginwrapper" for a
lot of plugins. The open-source Flash player that comes with openSUSE
11.1 is usable on most Flash sites, but I am running the Adobe 32-bit
one anyhow. I tried the Adobe "alpha" 64-bit plugin, but there is *zero*
documentation on how to use it, and once I figured out that it worked, I
dropped it and sent a nastygram to Adobe telling them that they need to
provide documentation.

The Java situation is even more confusing. The "Open JDK" one works, but
the Sun one doesn't. "$ firefox about:plugins" is your friend on a
64-bit machine.

While working as the root administrator, I did a dir and ls for /root
and it showed empty.  I can see the directory of other drives. What
command do I have to give to make the /root files visible?

Thank you in advance.

Type "ls -al" to see if the directory is truly empty.  Any file or
folder beginning with a period is hidden unless you use the -a switch.

/root is simply a home directory for the root user. It is not necessarily a
problem if it is empty, though it would be kind of odd.

my issue wasn't documentation, as the ubuntu forums have a simple
howto that worked fine.  the plugin crashed my browser (opera or ff)
constantly though--it handled youtube fine, but every other flash
thing that i tried (or that was foisted on me in an ad) seemed to
crash the entire session.

i'm definitely waiting for a new release before poking that fire again.

not necessarily.  /root ships empty (well, empty of non-dotfiles at
least) on ubuntu and there's no way files would end up in there unless
someone put some effort into it, since there is no way to login as
root by default.

That's why I said "kind of" - making no assumptions about distros or
previous usage, and given my past experience, I would be surprised if I
logged into a system and found nothing in /root.

That's not the point. It shouldn't be up to the *user*, which is what
Ubuntu forums are, to "figure out" how to use the plugin. If you
download what Adobe supplies, it is a tarball consisting of a single
file. Once you unpack the tarball, you are left with a shared library,
with absolutely no directions on where to put it. There was nothing on
the Adobe site either. I find that upsetting since Adobe made a big deal
about doing the 64-bit Linux plugin.

That said, I in fact found workarounds for quite a few openSUSE issues
during my testing of 11.1 RC1 by searching Fedora and Ubuntu forums. :)
Much as I hate to admit it, I think, aside from the RPM / deb divide,
there's not a whole heck of a lot of difference any more between Fedora,
Ubuntu and openSUSE.

Since I'm now an "openSUSE advocate", I've become sensitized to this.
However, the aim of the openSUSE community seems not to be competing
with other Linux distros but competing with Windows and MacOS X. Are any
of you close enough to Fedora or Ubuntu to know if they have similar
philosophies? After Shuttleworth made his statement about nobody being
able to make money with the Linux desktop, I wonder about stuff like
that. :)

Subject: [PLUG] The trouble with different browsers...
Message-ID: <20081223172928.4g4avl74bosk4gso@web.robinson-west.com>

There is so much rotgut on the Net.  If you go with a browser
other than Firefox, you can't install Procon.  In the interest
of being filtered, looking for a lower memory footprint browser
might not be the greatest idea.  There's also the issue of
compatibility.  Freedos 1.0 has arachne and I finally found a
packet driver for my built-in Intel nic.  Thing is, Arachne
isn't compatible with a host of web sites including horde
webmail imp sites.  As far as I know, there isn't a filter
plugin for Arachne that's comparable to procon.  I uninstalled
arachne from my freedos system because it isn't filterable.
I'm hoping that freedos 1.1 will be more compatible with MS-DOS.
I'd like to run netware where mars is simply broken.

I wish what the average person would call rotgut wasn't so easily
accessed on the Net, but there's no law enforcement and there are
no laws when it comes to web sites.  At least it seems that there
are no laws.  Maybe there's no stomach to apply the same standard
for what you can do on the street to what you can do on the Net.
Why is there a Melissa porn site that shows samples to anyone who
hasn't done a thing to identify who they are and how old they are?
There are many sites like this.  Looking at these kinds of sites
for some has cost them their marriage.  For being "harmless," the
person posing is someone's: child, brother, or sister whom your are
reducing to a mere object if you watch.  Think about it.  A non
Firefox browser may have trouble rendering some of these sites,
but chances are that plenty of inappropriate content is accessible
to anyone who uses a browser that supports pictures.

On the "harmless" point, what if there are laws that go after the
people who decide to view lude sites?  What if you get labeled a
sex offender?  The people who need to be busted are the pimps, but
is that going to happen?  There have been high profile cases where
people have been charged as sexual offenders for merely storing
samples of what they find online.  I understand that you don't have
to be a producer of lude content to get busted.  I don't know why,
but sexual addiction is treated differently than say alcoholism
even though arguably it is an addiction and similar in many
respects.  There is secrecy for example in hiding your computer
activities as opposed to say empty beer bottles.  The scary thing
is, it's better to be labeled an alcoholic than it is to be labeled
a sex offender.  What I see is a wild unregulated Internet and
innocent victims who are more likely to get into legal trouble than
the criminals who are producing inappropriate web sites in the first
place.  These victims don't have to be adults, they can be children.
It should be illegal to let just anyone view your web site if there
is nudity or sexual activity portrayed on it.  Free samples of lude
activity where no effort is made to identify who you are should be
illegal.  I'd like to outlaw the whole "adult" industry altogether,
but I realize that that isn't going to happen.

In short, there are threads on here discussing low memory footprint
browsers.  Well, does low memory footprint mean that you don't
filter your web access?  There is dansguardian, but going through
a proxy in general doesn't always work and dansguardian seems more
likely to block legitimate activity than say Procon.  Firefox is
very filterable via Procon and if someone else has the password to
it, it is hard to bypass.  Start introducing other browsers that
don't have Procon, there isn't any protection.  You defeat a major
reason for sticking with Firefox.

Even if you have no objections yourself to "lude" web sites, filtering
them out is a good legal strategy.

I tend to agree, although Ubuntu is perhaps a small bit more user
friendly for the beginner coming from Windows or MacOS. What keeps me
in the Ubuntu world is debian package management software, plus it's
the devil I know.

I didn't know he said that. In fact, I know he has said on more than
one occasion that the goal of Ubuntu is to prove to the Linux world
that Linux can work just fine on the desktop. And that certainly has
been the historical thrust of Ubuntu. As for making money from it,

I know it was long.  Will nobody attempt to reply?

So, does Midori have filtering plugins?  How about Opera?

Why is it that plugins install pretty much automatically for
people using firefox under Windows but automatic install generally
doesn't work under Linux?

I don't think there's any significant difference between package
management systems using RPM and deb formats. Nor do I think there's any
significant difference between the package management software utilities
-- yum, apt-get, YaST, zypper, etc., with or without GUI wrappers. They
all do the same things: poll for updates, resolve dependencies, give you
a categorized menu of software you can install, etc.

The difference that I find significant is the *number* of packages in
the distro-specific repositories. There, Debian is a winner, and I think
Gentoo is a strong number two. You have to go hunting outside the main
distro repositories for a lot of software in the RPM-based systems.

and also

http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Shuttleworth-Make-Desktop-Linux-Better-than-Apple/

Now, I've only looked over the shoulder of Mac users, never taken a Mac
desktop and customized it to my personal workflow. I *have* done that
for Windows and for Gnome (2.24 + Compiz as built on openSUSE 11.x), KDE
(3.x, a long time ago) and WindowMaker.

I think I still prefer WindowMaker over the others, and I'm not sure
Compiz is contributing anything except eye candy at the moment. But I
brought WindowMaker up just yesterday and it seemed somehow restrictive
after just about a month of the openSUSE Gnome. I also brought up KDE
4.1 ... I floundered around on it for half a day and decided not to mess
with it any more.

So for now I am staying with Gnome. And I'd be terribly surprised if a
Windows or Mac user looking over my shoulder would even pay attention to
whether my desktop was "prettier" than theirs, or even more "efficient".

I have only recently looked at Midori, but it does not have plugins that
I can determine. It is extensible, or so it's claimed on the web site
(<http://www.twotoasts.de>), via C and possibly Lua, but I've no clue
how to do that. Probably this will become a plug-in feature in time. 
Remember that Midori is _alpha_ software, and any or all of it's
features may change with the wind. (Though IMHO it looks very clean and
useable even now.)

I have not looked at Opera in several years, so I can't say yea or nay.

I have used Firefox under Linux (Fedora) and Windows XP Pro, and have
never had any trouble installing plugins for either platform.  (Except
for Adobe Flash, which is a frelling pain in the posterior at the best
of times.)  For most plugins the procedure is the same:  Go to the
Firefox extensions web page, browse through the plugins until you find
the one you want, then click on Download.  It will pop up a requester;
click on INSTALL (or OK) and the plugin will be installed.  Reapeat
until done.  After that, Firefox has to be restarted to activate the
plugins.  Updates occur automatically so long as they're enabled in
Preferences.

I'm snowed in too, but most of the time without Internet. I was able to 
retrieve e-mail yesterday, but then the cable went  out, again. I'm 
drafting a bunch of replies, and will try to send them when the cable 
comes back up.

That makes sense, sort of. I can't go look at the link, but I tried 
changing the ownership of /srv to rsteff:rsteff. The problem remains, so 
I changed the ownership of /srv back to root:root.

Message-ID: <1230319571.23201.7.camel@UbuntuHH>

Folks, 

I'm getting to the point where my desktop (which really should be a
server) is getting creaky. Well, I need to be able to set up hardware
virtualization on something other than my laptop. 

In this boxing day search, I've found this tempting offer
www.compusa.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4353543&CatId=333 

Yeah, I should add a cooling fan to this, but it looks like I can pretty
much just transfer hard drives and be ready to go with this. Sure I wish
this motherboard could handle 8GB, but I think 4GB should be sufficient
for a bunch of 256MB VMs. Not like I'm planning to run Vista.  

The thing I'm not sure about is the motherboard, an EVGA e-7050/610i. 
www.compusa.com/applications/SearchTools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=4245906&sku=E145-2050&srkey=E145-2050 

though http://wiki.linuxmce.org/index.php/EVGA_nForce_e-7050_610i seems
promising.

Perhaps there's an alternative local source, now that I'm almost ready
to drive without chains (which seem to limit me to 10mph).

Thanks,
Mike

First off, it comes with 3 GB of ram, not 4.  Still, for a quad-core chip
included in the price, it doesn't look bad...  Power supply may or may not
be adequate with more than a few drives if you are running the system
full-tilt...  Otherwise looks good.

I got my desktop built at CompUsa when they still had a store here. But
I ended up with a Gigabyte motherboard and an AMD Athlon64 X2 processor,
not an Intel one. I'd recommend spending the extra bucks for the 8 GB if
you can, and you'll probably want to go for a full 64-bit distro. If
your current desktop is a 32-bit one, just moving the hard drives
"should work" but it might not be worth the troubleshooting time if it
doesn't. :)

What virtualization are you going to use? VirtualBox? Xen? KVM? Qemu?
The free ESXi?

I am deleting some old backups and I getting some errors like

When I do a directory listing I get a bunch of question marks where I

What do the permissions of the parent folder look like?
Are these backups to the same disk your system runs on?

The parent folder is
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 240 Apr 10  2008 t

and the backup is on a separate disk  from the system being backed up.

I tried changing owners and permissions for the troublesome files, but
this is denied also.

What happens when you chmod 777 the parent directory?

Also what does 'mount' say for the backup drive?

Well ... I ran into something like this and ended up having to write a
Perl script to open the directory ("opendir"), search through it, and
then unlink all the files with the bogus names. I couldn't figure out
how to do that from the command line or a bash script -- I had to do it
in Perl.

But depending on how badly messed up other things in the filesystem are,
you might be safer making a copy of everything you do want (which you
should do anyhow), rebuilding the filesystem, and copying stuff back.

So ... first step ... back up everything! Then at least if the
filesystem is badly broken, you can get a clean one.

   What happens if the rm command is followed by the file names in double
quotes? I know this works when there are blanks or undisplayable characters
in the filename, but I've no idea what the question marks might indicate.

That's the problem ... the question marks stand for characters that have
no printable equivalent. I had to read them with Perl code and pass the
name strings to the unlink routine to get rid of them. There may be a
command-line routine that will convert them to hexadecimal or something,
but the Perl thing worked before I had a chance to dig into other hacks.

Now if you have the inode numbers (ls -li), there might be a way to get
rid of them by inode number. I think I tried that, but I don't remember.
I also think I tried "rm -i *" and saying yes for the bogus ones and
that didn't work either for some reason. It was faster for me to do it
in Perl. That also gave me the ability to print the file names, etc., in
hexadecimal.

Hi Ed, 

I need to be able to run Xen or KVM, and already run 64-bit Ubuntu
server (so hardware virtualization is a must). I'd love to find a decent
deal on some equivalent mobo kit which could handle 8GB. Can you suggest
one?

Thanks,
Mike

One old UNIX trick on deleting files with funky names is to use the find 
command  with the  ls -i command.  ls -i gives you the inode for the 
file.  You can then use the find command to locate the file using the 
inode and with the -exec option of find remove it.

[me at mysystem ~]$ touch inode
[me at mysystem ~]$ ls -i inode
2907819 inode
[me at mysystem ~]$ find . -inum 2907819 -exec rm {} \;
[me at mysystem ~]$ ls -l inode
ls: cannot access inode: No such file or directory
[me at mysystem ~]$

Ed,

Suggestion on the "rm" you tried.  Try
	rm -i .??*
That should pickup almost all of the files starting with a "." except "."
and "..".
Suggest doing an
	ls .??*
First to verify it picks up the file in question.

that's unfortunate and indicates filesystem corruption in my
experience.  if it's a network filesystem, it may just be some
confusion over the wire--i have an SMB mount point that is unusable
and unfixable on one machine (which i don't want to reboot), while
remounting the same FS on a different directory makes the files show
up as expected...but every time i've ever seen that on a mounted,
local filesystem (NB, i rarely use non-unix filesystems like HFS,
NTFS, etc, so those might just want remounting too), it's been
filesystem corruption, and a run past fsck will scoot those inodes
over to the lost+found directory if the FS is salvageable at all.

whatever you do, do it soon, since corruption tends to spread.

This didn't look like a great endorsement of the motherboard, the NIC
wasn't recognized and  he had to go through some strange hoops to do
the installation.

The reviews for the motherboard here
http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductReview.aspx?Item=N82E16813188034
are also not so encouraging.

Filesystem corruption was indeed the problem. It took 9 hours to run,
but among the things fsck did was to remove the problem files.

I tried deleting the files using the inode number

ls -i
9921738 rpl_ignore_table.test
find . -inum 9921738 -exec rm {} \;
find: `./rpl_ignore_table.test': Permission denied

which would be a good trick for files with crazy names, but this
wasn't the problem.

Then I ran
fsck.reiserfs  --rebuild-tree  /dev/sdb2

One of the log messages revealed that the problem was an entry
pointing to nowhere.

rebuild_semantic_pass: The entry [9920235 9921738]
("rpl_ignore_table.test") in directory [12616279 12630835] points to
nowhere - is removed

9 hours later fsck was done, I remounted the filesystem and the
troublesome files were gone.

Thanks Chris and everyone else for your suggestions,

Bill

Uh ... reiserfs? You were lucky it came back after the nine hours. It's
great when things work, but when they don't, it can be almost impossible
to recover.

Well it could be that reiserfs is the culprit in the original
corruption, but I have no evidence of this at the moment. I have been
using it for many years without a problem. The overall situation is
that my main filesystem is JFS and that I have a backup disk which
uses Reiserfs. The backup is done using dirvish which creates a lot of
hard links so my reasoning was that reiserfs would be more disk space
efficient with a lot of really small files. Of course if reiserfs is
the cause of the corruption my reasoning is a bit short sighted  and I
will have to reconsider the disk size/ stability tradeoff.

I had a reiserfs partition that died a painful death once. I had some
others that never gave me any trouble. I've never tried JFS. At the
moment, I use XFS, because it had the best characteristics on most
benchmarks. The only operation where it seems to be really slow is a
moderate-sized recursive "rm".

I'm waiting for ext4 and btrfs to stabilize; then I'll re-evaluate.

Bill, thanks so much. I didn't realize that NewEgg had such an extensive
database of reviews. These reviews also note one customer who couldn't
get virtualization going because of the motherboard, which is a
showstopper for me.

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] kio_http is a pig
Message-ID: <20081229173934.6fda9045.johnxj@comcast.net>

My favorite torrent client is Ktorrrent (3.1.2 on KDE 4.1.3), even
though my computer uses standard Gnome desktop with Intrepid x86_64.

At the moment one torrent is running (downloading), and there is only
one seeder. The computer is jerky, screens don't refresh smoothly,
mouse and keyboard are intermittent, and basically the CPU cores are
tied up. Looking in System > Administration > System Monitor reveals
that there are three instances of kio_http running, each consuming 30+%
of CPU time. That is, 30+% on each of the dual cores. For both cores
the little lines in the graph are pegged at the top. I have a little
CPU widget in the Gnome panel and it reflects 2.00 GHz for the CPUs,
where it normally displays 800 or 1600. The CPU fan has been running
constantly all day. Little wonder the computer is unresponsive. The
kio_http's are also each consuming about 250 MB of RAM, although the
computer has 4 GB, so that is probably not an issue.

Google only reveals that this has been reported over and over. Looking
at dozens of complaints, I haven't found any that has received an
answer or a solution.

If I close down Ktorrent the computer returns to normal. But stopping
all torrents changes nothing - that is, even if Ktorrent is completely
paused the three instances of kio_http remain running and continue
sucking down most of the CPU time. Closing down Ktorrent makes all
three disappear. 

Any suggestions welcome.

I know this is an easy one but, how about don't use Ktorrent??
Have you tried other torrent clients to see if they suffer the same issues,
or is it Ktorrent specific?

I have used Azureus mainly, both Linux and Windoze.  I haven't noticed any
serious system slowdowns when using it.
GNOME also has Transmission, and there is Deluge.  I haven't tried those
since Azureus gets the job done for me.

I tried Azureus once a couple years ago. It crashed several times an
hour, which is why I gave it up. I haven't tried it recently. I also
tried several others - BitTorrent, Deluge, Transmission - but each had
little control or features. Not that I know what I'm doing anyway. The
workings of torrents are a black art. 

More importantly, I am curious about kio_http. What is it? Why does it
replicate itself over and over and take control of the entire computer?
If it's a replicator, is the solution to form alliance with the Wraith?
<Evil breathy hiss.> And if it's so evil, why do I find only a few
dozen complaints about it, with no apparent solutions offered?

I can't answer what it is but there are several instances because it's
multi threaded.

Tell me more about nice. I see a column in System > Administration >

Nice allows you to control how much any given process has access to
resources. Much like setting priorities for a process in Windows.

nice -19 {I believe thats the lowest priority but I may have it backwards, I
haven't used nice in a few years}  <$PID or process name>

Here is a good explanation of what kio_http is.

>From the nice(1) man page, on my debian box:

"Nicenesses  range from -20 (most favorable scheduling) to 19 (least
favorable)."

I believe the value is how "nice" the process is to others.  So a high
niceness results in a lower priority.  Things that are unimportant
should be run with a higher niceness than important things.

Subject: [PLUG] External CSS vs in a <style> tag in the <head> section
Message-ID: <495A947E.20502@comcast.net>

I have some style code that works when it is in the <head> section of a 
web page, but not when it is in an external file. Shouldn't it work the 
same? The style code for the body, #sidebar, and #main sections appear 
to work correctly. Any idea why the parts between the body section and 
the #sidebar section are ignored when they are imported from an external 
file, but work correctly when they are inside <style></style> tags in 
the .html file?

Here's the current <head> section:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <head>
    <title>Winter Storm, December, 2008</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />
    </head>

I copied the entire <style> section and put it in a file named 
style.css. I removed the <style></style> tags, before saving it.

Here's the contents of style.css:

/* Style Sheet for Comcast Site */

body {
  background: #EED;
  margin: 0;
  }

div.pic {
  float: left;
  height: 190px;
  width: 130px;
  padding: 0 5px;
  margin: 5px 3px;
  }
div.pic img {
  border: 1px solid;
  border-color: #444 #AAA #AAA #444;
  }
div.ls img {
  height: 96px;
  width: 128px;
  margin: 32px 0 0;
  }
div.pt img {
  height: 128px;
  width: 96px;
  margin: 0 16px;
  }
div.pic ul {
  margin: 0.25em 0 0;
  padding: 0;
  font: bold small Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;
  list-style: none;
  }
li.title {
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
  }

#sidebar {
  position: absolute;
    top: 32px;
  width: 130px;
  padding: 0;
  }

#main {
  position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 5px;
  margin: 0 0 0 140px;
  }

Just a couple of things off the top of my head:

- Did you specify the URL right?  That is, is the "style.css" file in
  the same directory as the main HTML document?

- Any case-sensitivity issues?  Is it "Style.css" instead?

- Permissions?  Can you actually hit the full URL for the style sheet
  manually to verify that browsers can retrieve it?

Good luck,
tim

This looks correct. Are you viewing it via a web server or your local 
filesystem?

If you're using a web server, is "style.css" in the same directory as 
the HTML file quoted above? Is the file readable by the web server? Do 
the logs show a 200 (OK) response when the client requests the 
stylesheet? (Does the client request the right file?)

Apache on my local system. I'm getting at it from a local host home page.

Yes, and yes. As I mentioned in the other reply, some of the style 
settings are being applied, so I'm pretty sure the browser is reading 
the file. It's just not doing anything with the some of the parts.

Yes, although most of the time it's 304, which I discovered means Not 
Modified.

Yes. The name of the file is style.css.

Nope. I checked that. Plus, some of the style settings work.

I didn't know I could do that! Learn something new every day. Yes. When 
I point my browser at the file, it is displayed.

Thanks for the insight.

This is a total shot-in-the-dark, but try removing all the comments
from the file, just to see if that makes a difference.  I've had
issues with comments in css in the past, although I don't remember the
specifics of the issues.

I think that certain style elements play nicely in an external file,
while others do not.  I can never get body {} to work from an external
stylesheet.

External stylesheets are a bit overrated.  How can you dynamically
generate styles with a hardcoded file?  But it does cut down on the
number of bytes sent over the wire.

Why would you ever need to?  I've done a lot of dynamic websites and
tested hundreds more.  I've never seen a good reason to dynamically
generate style sheets.  Just create multiple static ones or all of the
classes you'll need and reference them dynamically.

Creating multiple copies of the same code is not good programming
practice.  It is better to create a single template, and use
programming logic to fill in the dynamic bits.  The moment you have
multiple copies of the same code, you have multiple points of
maintenance.  The moment you find yourself writing the same thing
twoce, you should stop and ask yourself, "How can I make it so I only
have to write this once?"  Avoiding duplication is one of the
fundamental rules of good programming.

Message-ID: <8663l1rpyu.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I've got a need for an old laptop with an rs232 serial port.  It is
for a legacy application that needs a real serial port, a usb-serial
converter doesn't work (we've tried).  The old laptop that we used to
run this application on is pretty much dead, at least to the extent
that repairing it by replacing the motherboard is a multi-week project
that won't be timely.  New laptops don't have real serial ports.

Does anyone on the list have an old laptop that they would be willing
to sell or loan, that I could get ahold of in the next few days?

Thanks!

Well, yes, I agree, but there are limits to this.  You have 43 copies of
the letter 'a' in your last email.  Should you write a method for that?
This philosphy only goes so far.  I've seen many programs taken too far
in this direction with dozens of layers of abstraction which accomplish
nothing except make the code hard to read.  Note that I do security code
review for a living, so I see *lots* of other peoples' code.  You can't
account for every possible feature request that comes down the road, and
Murphy's law indicates the customer will pick the one you didn't think
of.  There needs to be a balance.

As far as style sheets go, they are already a major step toward
abstraction of page look & feel.  I haven't seen many sites that have
more than a couple of dozen styles, if that.  I'm no designer, but if
you get many more, I'd guess the site might start looking hideous.
Making them dynamic saves you what?  A few paragraphs of static data
that you can't as easily ask the browser to cache?

On the flip side, most programmers still haven't figured out how to
prevent cross-site scripting bugs when they include user-supplied data
in their pages.  There are indeed ways to inject script into style
sheets.  Are you allowing user-influenced data to get in there?  Why
take the risk?

   In my very limited experience the problems that arise have less to do with
the number of style sheets (I have one style.css for our site) and more to
do with trying to accommodate all the non-standard junk in various versions
of IE. That browser ought to be outlawed.

Hear hear!  Yes, IE is very bad at complying with any web standard,
particularly style sheets.  I think IE7 was supposed to improve that,
but far too many users are still using 6.

Your letter A example doesn't apply.  This is human readable text,
whereas I was talking about computer code.  One is meant for a human
to read, while the other is meant for a computer.  These are two very
different audiences.  Computers can perform tokenization and
substitution very easily, while humans cannot.  Humans have a hard
time reading dry, repetitous text, while computers don't care.

But let's say for the sake of argument that this weren't a factor.
How could I write a function that would result in less typing than a
single character "A"?  I think a better example be replacing every
occurance of "Kafka" with "K", as Kafka himself did liberally.

A programmer should separate the static from the dynamic.  The static
becomes the template, and the dynamic becomes the raw data.  This is
what a lisp programmer does when writing a macro.  There is a thought
process that allows a programmer to turn segments of repeated code
into a single macro with arguments.  What goes into the body of the
macro, and what becomes the arguments?  Do the arguments consist of
arbitrary executable code?  Especially in the case of a lisp macro,
the answer is often "yes".  It's part of that whole "code that writes
code" thing.

Naturally one has to consider security.  I have heard it said that
security cannot be slapped on as an afterthought; it must be an
integral part of the design.  And certainly it cannot be ignored, for
human nature dictates that any piece of code can and will fall under
attack.  So let's rank security right alongside the other fundamentals
of computer science, as is its rightful place.

Are security and avoidance of code duplication mutually exclusive?  Of
course not, but there is some non-orthagonality there; one can affect
the other, so they must be balanced against one another.  There are
other factors that act upon the structure in the same way, for example
the finiteness of resources.  Having to balance forces that are at
odds with one another, some of which are imposed from the outside by
mischievous humans, is what makes programming an artform.

Since it is an artform, its aesthetic quality ought to be a goal in
its creation.  That's why I get bothered by code duplication; it seems
bereft of artistic sensibility.  I guess that's the truth of why I
take the soapbox and speak against it.  It's a romantic, idealist
point of view.  I don't expect many others to share it.  I don't see
many others sharing it in my day-to-day life at work.  Most people
think of software as a tool to get a job done, and nothing more.  As
long as it does its job, who cares if it is full of copy-and-paste
code, or if it has thousand-line if...then constructs?  Who would even
know?

I still think this analogy is a good one (if any are).  If you take code
reuse too far, you make your programs harder for humans (programmers) to
understand and don't actually save any literal lines of code.  By
writing a macro or something similar to print the letter a, and the
reference it 43 times, you'd have a similar effect where we'd have a
hard time reading it and it would only make your text bigger.

Right.  Basically the way I see it is that styles are your macro and by
making them dynamic, you're dynamically generating your macros.  Next
will we dynamically generate server-side scripts which generate styles
which apply to pages?

Dynamically generated code (and to a lesser extent, macros) is a very
serious danger in a security context.  If you don't do it very
carefully, user-supplied input could find it's way in there and break
out of your syntax.  That often results in code execution in some
context.  Here are some examples:

  - JavaScript and HTML are essentially inseparable.  JavaScript is
    executable code (if in a sandbox most of the time) so this is how we
    ended up with most of the evils of cross-site scripting. We're
    forced to dynamically generate code because of the Web's poor
    design.  (/me glares at Netscape)

  - system() and popen().  Perhaps the most scary ones.  The command
    line *is* code after all.  Please never use these functions, as
    they're poorly designed even outside of the security implications.
    If you feel you have to use them, at least don't ever embed
    user-supplied values in the strings you pass off.

  - Ever thought of printf()-style format strings as code?  Most people
    don't, but if you allow user-supplied values to sneak into the
    templates themselves, an attacker can read/write arbitrary memory
    locations and execute code.

Anyway, so I hope you see why I don't think styles themselves should be
dynamically generated.

Yes!  Secure coding principles desperately need to work their way into
university curricula.  I teach on-the-job training courses to
programmers off and on in order to help them improve the security of
their coding.  In conversations with students, I often ask if they had
seen any of the material in their undergrad courses.  It's very rare
that they do.  I hope some professors out there are reading this.  The
stuff I teach isn't rocket surgery.  It's really basic, "how to write
good code that happens to be secure" kinds of things.

No, actually I think avoidance of code duplication, in most contexts, is
very beneficial to security.  Take the famous Code Red and Nimda worms.
One of the bugs they exploited was in IIS was a remote execution bug
which occurred due to poorly constructed repetition of URL validation
code.  Elimination of code duplication is very important for data
validation and encoding/decoding.

Hey, I'm a card-carrying idealist too. =)  I think code should look
pretty too.  It's just that I've spent the last few years watching
programmers shoot themselves in the foot with respect to security and I
tend to ask "why do you need that gun anyway?".  Sure, I know guns don't
shoot people, people shoot people, but if you don't know how to work the
gun in the first place, maybe you shouldn't be packing.

Thanks for the reminder. I haven't done a lot of web coding in a while. 
I remember using this some years ago. Until I finished the code last 
night, it was not visible to the validator, since it was on my home 
network, only.

The page is now published:

http://home.comcast.net/~rsteff/Dec-2008/index.html

When submitted to the validator:

Result: 47 Errors, 5 warning(s)

I've got some cleaning up to do!

A number of the problems are from changing the concept from the 
thumbnails being links to having an onclick action. I missed getting rid 
of some of the </a> tags.

Others are ones I'll have to read up on to learn what I did wrong.

I've got two other sites I'm currently working on, so I'll put that 
validator to good use.

Thanks, again.

Waaaay back in September, I sent mail describing a serious hardware

toward trying to fix it.  I also received cogent and generous advice from

Since I described the problem here, for completeness I figure I should 
describe the cause and solution also.

Well, the 'new' chip didn't bring the system back to life either.  Not 
wanting to spend any more time or money on the whole project, I just 
switched over to a crappy backup machine for a while, and more recently 
was able to snag a bunch of semi-functional 3 - 4 year old machines that 
were being junked at work, and assemble them into one pretty good machine, 
better than the desktop that up and died on me.  I shelved the remains of 
the old desktop.

Just today, as I was doing some maintenance on my daughter's machine, I 
got it into my head to put one of her memory DIMMs into my stricken box. 
It booted up immediately.

Damn.

Rich Shepard had suggested new RAM, but I ignored that because I was 
convinced that the motherboard ought to respond, in some way - a beep, 
something - even without RAM.  It turns out that's not the case.  I was 
suspicious of the existing RAM, but foolishly assumed that the BIOS would 
respond differently when given bad RAM vs. no RAM.  Live and learn.

This has been a great discussion.  Thank you so much for having it
with me.  It illustrates the point that programming is not an exact
science, even if many aspects of it appear to be.  Maybe that's why it
is still called a science.  When studying art (the violin, for
example), there is a lot that appears to be science-like.  Either a
note is in tune, or it is not.  Either the rhythm is accurate, or it
is not.  There is a whole system of math to describe the interplay of
tones, called Music Theory.  Yet something very real separates a
Heifetz performance from Zuckermann, even from the very first note.

You would like to see professors pay more attention to security
because they neglect the fact that it is a cornerstone of computer
science.  I would like to see corporate muckymucks understand that
programming is a creative art because they think that with enough
trendy methodology, they could get a monkey to write software.  These
sound completely unrelated, but I think we have shown that they are
two sides of the same coin.

What this discussion lacked is an example of a dynamically generated
stylesheet.  We really need to look at a specific example and decide
if it's sound or faulty.  I had one in my previous post, but then
deleted it, because it would have been far less entertaining.  Without
a specific example, the words "dynamic stylesheet" don't have enough
meaning to have a scientific discussion because there are infinite
variations on that theme.

I just tried validating your page, and it looks like you only have
three recurring syntax problems.

1: You're typing <img src="foo" alt="bar"> instead of <img src="foo"
alt="bar"/> This is okay in SGML-based HTML (Regular HTML), but
doesn't work in XML-based XHTML.

2: The </a> tags that you mentioned.

3: You have & where you need &amp;. This is another SGML/XML mismatch.
In XHTML you need to escape an ampersand, even if it's in an attribute
value or embedded Javascript and CSS. (So, there's a good reason to
take your CSS out of the head element).

Fix these issues and that should take care all but one of the errors.

Hi Russell,

I have an old Micron PII running Win9x with both 25 and 9 pin serial ports
on the motherboard.  Good working condition.  I'll sell for 50$ if you're
interested.


Thanks and happy new year!

I think your assumption was entirely reasonable.  Given that the BIOS 
could temporarily use the cache RAM on the processor for stack, etc., 
I'm surprised that the BIOS was unable to detect and report a problem 
with RAM.

Just a anecdote:

My recently assembled BYO system (AMD 780G chipset) wouldn't POST (no
beeps, but the chassis fans spun up) w/o being "powered on" for a few
minutes plus poking the reset button a few times. Finally found a
forum post describing some memory timing settings in the BIOS that
fixed it, specifically EPP mode off (not referring to the parallel
port, as far as I can tell) and "Set memory clock" to manual:

http://forums.anandtech.com/messageview.aspx?catid=29&threadid=2199171

Now it boots fine.

First off, I think Tim makes a lot of very good points about why you
should not generate style information on raw (or nearly raw) user
input -- it's dangerous.  However, as Carlos points out, there are
just too many "flavors" of dynamic css to discuss them all as one
entity.

I find that CSS is a horrible language for expressing styles.  It
lacks a lot of things that other languages have to help programmers
find errors -- as was evidenced by our collective inability to find
the syntax error that was causing Richard's problem in the first
place.  That leads to one argument in favor of generating css from
some other format that provides better static analysis, things like
variables (or constants, anyway) and other abstractions that help
maintain consistency across a design.  It would also be nice to have a
cleaner way to generate styles for various browsers (so you don't
*have* to use bizzare parsing bugs in IE 6 to make it ignore all the
w3c valid code that would break the layout otherwise, or to tweak the
fonts...)

Note that each chunk of css may be essentially fixed at runtime, and
your webserver just selects the correct collections of info based on
run-time information (eg: browser type, or the page you're looking
at..).  I think this would be more easily done if the stylesheets were
referenced as separate "files", vs. being included in-line.

Anyway, I'm also a novice web developer (with only a couple years of
work with css / flow-based layouts) but I've had enough exposure to
css to know that it could be greatly improved.  One way to do so is
with a preprocessor.

I didn't pay attention to the little voice in my head that said I should 
do that. Got that one, too. Thanks.

More than one, actually. I neglected to include:

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" />

And I was using transitional technique in a strict setting with:

    <script language="Javascript">

For strict, you need:

    <script type="text/javascript">

The "language" part is not used in strict, and it must all be lower case.

That validator is good for validating, debugging, and teaching. I'll 
make greater use of it from now on.

That's really ugly.  It's also another justification for the coreboot

This applies to any tag that doesn't have a corresponding closing tag.
In XML all elements have to be closed (that's why you always need a
</p> for each <p>). This piece of syntax creates a single tag that
both opens and closes the element. So, <foo/> is parsed the same way
as <foo></foo>.

I figured that was just a warning, so I didn't count it.

And I figured you'd get that one without help. So, back to the
original issue. Is your stylesheet working properly?

Yes, thanks. It's a blend of stuff I figured out for myself and things 
from "More Eric Meyer on CSS". That's where the </a> came from. He had 
an example of styling a photo collection. In his case, the thumbnails 
were links that opened a larger size image in a new window. A number of 
years ago, I put together a frameset to do a similar job. In fact, an 
example is still up on my web site:

http://home.comcast.net/~rsteff/ParlorOrgan/index.html

I wanted a way to have all the thumbnails visible, and have them open 
the larger image in the middle of the page.

The winter storm collection does it without frames, although I don't 
have thumbnails on both sides of the window.

So, can you tell us why it didn't work? I'm mystified, and based on
the responses I don't think I'm the only one (or did I miss-read
something?).

I don't know the answer. But I do know that someone has figured it out.

http://www.btscene.com/details/881376/

Using Firefrox, with popup blocker enabled, click on just about
anything on that page. You will be treated to a full-screen popup
window advertising hot girls. Why they thought someone searching for a
Gernsheim symphony would be interested in hot girls escapes me.

I find this on more and more sites. Searching the Firefox forums I find
that it is being treated as a bug in the popup blocker.

So if you're creating a website and you want to annoy the hell out of
your visitors, apparently there is now a way.

Using Firefox 3 on Fedora 6, I don't get any pop-ups, not even the
warning that a pop-op was attempted.

It's a torrent site, a lot of them are supported by ads of porn sites.
