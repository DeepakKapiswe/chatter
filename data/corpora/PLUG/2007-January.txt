                             MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT

                        The Portland Linux/Unix Group
                                  will meet
                          7 PM Thursday Jan 4, 2007
                                      at
                          Portland State University
                                      in
                            Smith Memorial Center

      *******************************************************************

                                 PRESENTATION

                                      by

                              Randal L. Schwartz
                           <merlyn at stonehenge.com>


      As most of you know Randal is "the primary person to blame
      for Stonehenge Consulting Services, Inc."  He is author of
      many of the principal books and articles on Perl programming,
      and gives many workshops including workshops with Geek Cruises.
      Randal is also an expert on computer crime both as a consultant
      to law enforcement agencies and as a defendant who became
      a felon for doing his job with a bit too much enthusiasm.

      I'm waiting for Randal to verify the topic of his talk, but
      I believe he intends to talk about his experiences with
      computer crime and the legal system and what you need to do
      to avoid having similar problems.

      *******************************************************************

          Agenda:

              7:00 - 7:30  Business
                   We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects
                   including PLUG's monthly Advanced Topics meetings,
                   PLUG's monthly hands on clinics, PLUG for Education,
                   etc.

              7:30 - 8:30  Presentation

          P.S.  PDXLUG provides a less formal alternative to PLUG
                emphasizing the needs of new users.   PDXLUG meets
                every second Thursday of the month in southeast Portland.
                See http://www.PDXLUG.org for details.

                at 6:30 PM on the first Tuesday of the month.
                They have out grown their meeting location at PEAK
                and are now meeting on the OSU campus.
                See http://www.lug.corvallis.or.us/ for details.

          P.S.  The Eugene Linux Users Group meets several times a month.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu standard Firefox sucks
Message-ID: <006e01c72e1a$a652a550$6d01a8c0@RAMA>

Under Kunbuntu I installed Firefox using Adept_Manager.
I could not even get Firefox to go to google.com or yahoo.com.
Originally I thought is was my routing table, but no, it was Firefox.
I started looking for a 2.0 version in .deb form.
I finally found a .deb in SwiftFox, which is an optimized Firefox.

Downloaded it and installed (after removing Firefox) and everything seems
happy.
Why is Ubuntu distributing a broken Firefox?

It may only be Kubuntu.  I have both Xubuntu (as a vmplayer image 6.06LTS) and
Ubuntu 6.10 installed on a laptop and both work just fine.  I even
updated Xubuntu
last night which updated firefox, it still works.

glibc (currently using 2.3.6) or placing an alternate libX11.so just for
firefox's use)

My understanding is that SwiftFox is proprietary. Ubuntu is big on not
including anything in its standard repositories that is not completely
open source. If you want stuff like that you must add the restricted
repositories.

As for why 2.0 is not available, that is because things in the debian
world are slow. It's even worse in 64-bit Ubuntu.

I should also add that my Firefox 1.5.0.8 runs just fine on my Dapper
amd-64 computer, aside from some missing plugins.

Connect the console port to a PC (done).  Then, from outside, ssh to
the PC.  (Haven't seen a way to configure the Cisco itself to use the
ssh protocol.)

Good debugging.  Did strace give any different info?

Also, it's a silly thought, but did you try nohwcursor in xorg.conf?

OK

Wasn't sure about the 678.

I know with 2500 you can turn on ssh...

FF2 is available in the Edgy Eft repositories, including an AMD64 
version.  I found the upgrade from Dapper Drake -> Edgy Eft to be 
painless.  Of course if have an AMD64 machine and need Flash you'll have 
to install a 32 bit version manually.

I think this might be why the Ubuntu version of Firefox sucks.

"The truth is, while Mozilla Firefox is open source, it is not entirely
free, and it may not even be legally compatible with Debian GNU/Linux, one
of the most popular community Linux distribution bases."

and....

"Debian adheres to a strict interpretation of what is Free Software and what
isn't, as outlined in the Debian Free Software
Guidelines<http://www.debian.org/social_contract>
."

here is the link to the article:

Thoughts?

Let's take this to PLUG-TALK -- I've got a *lot* of thoughts, mostly 
negative, about Firefox and Debian and Ubuntu :) I've mostly migrated to 
SeaMonkey, for example.

Well, DSL service providers offer static subnets where they don't do
DHCP for those customers.  With the advent of IPV6, ip addresses should
get cheaper.  As far as arguing that you can only put 255 people on
a /24 and that this isn't profitable, we are talking about DSL customers
or cable customers that are always supposed to have access.  If you only
have 1 subnet of 255 hosts and more than that many customers, say three
times as many, probably only a third of your customer can use the
service simultaneously.  Considering people tend 
to want access at the same time, 66% on average are probably going to be
angry when they get blocked.  There used to be dial-up ISP's that hit
13:1 ratios for people trying to get on.  People don't expect a
broadband experience to be like a dial-up one.  Besides that, there
probably aren't any dial-up ISP's that are that bad anymore.

The average DSL customer pays a minimum of $25/month.  That is $1575
gross from 255 paying customers each month.  Now what does the OC-3
feeding these people cost?  How much is lost to taxes?  $50+/month is
common for bridged customers with a subnet that have decent bandwidth.
The fees to ARIN, not an issue for ISP's because they already bridge
customers without doing dhcp and charge the customer for it in the
process.

Dynamic assignment of ip addresses only means you can serve more
customers if you are lucky enough to find people that are willing to
time share.  Considering that most people want Net access at the same
time, this is one of the main reasons why always on broadband was
invented.

Why do you have to do radius etcetera if you trust the physical lines
your customers are coming in on?  Let's look at Opus interactive
for a moment, what comes out of the modems of their St. Helens customers
that constitutes authentication information?  They connect to an ATM
network, but does that network require any authentication or is it
statically set up?  I remember having to put two fixed numbers into my
modem for service in Scappoose.  Seems to me that you can offer dhcp to
the right person by putting a custom configured instance on the correct
physical segment.  The only problem I see is that the ATM network is
probably run through a dumb concentrator/bridge causing all the
information about which segment traffic is coming from to be lost.

Right now I am going through servers on static ip addresses connected to
bridged DSL.  I guess Opus just plain trusts us.  There is no dhcp to
get onto the subnet.  I wonder if I'm still the only bridged DSL
customer in Scappoose or if others have gone this route?  

I have a hard time with the notion that you can't have all of your
DSL or cable customers on static subnets because of profit margins.
I also have a hard time with the notion that ISP's even necessarily 
use authentication.  I wish Opus would require authentication for
it's smtp service and I wish it would offer encrypted imap sessions.

Because some of us only want to carry so many devices.  Combining a couple
is a useful thing.  Not to mention that a number of pda functions and phone
functions intermix.  (Like looking up phone numbers from lists of contacts.)

There have been a few.  Nokia 770 is pretty cool.  There are a few others.
I tend to use a Moleskine PDA myself.

It is nice to carry a single device.  I used to carry a phone for
making calls and a PDA for personal organization.  My Treo does both
functions and is the same size as the PDA.  The mobile networking
makes it even better than both.  The qwerty keyboard is handy for
sending short emails and text messages.  The camera is crappy but it
is useful when you need it.  With an SD card, it can play music. It
can't be used for the general web sites but it can be used for
checking the weather, finding Trimet schedules, or reading Wikipedia.
The screen is small but I have read ebooks on it because it was
available.

Wifi is nice because when it is available it is usally free.  The
advantage of the mobile data plans is that they are available in more
places.  The 3G ones are even comparable in speed.  A smartphone
already has them available.  There are a few smartphones which have
both wifi and mobile data.  My impression is that the carriers prefer
smartphones without wifi because they want the money from expensive
data plans.

Bluetooth is a much better replacement for IR than a competitor to
Wifi.  It is designed for exchanging data between mobile devices.
Compared to IR, it is omnidirectional, faster, and longer range.
Compared of Wifi, it is slower, shorter range, cheaper, and lower
power.  Bluetooth has specialized protocols like USB. I use it to sync
between my laptop and Treo; send contacts and files to other phones;
and use it as modem for my laptop.  Other people use Bluetooth
headsets or headphones.

The tiny screen and keyboard aren't a replacement for a laptop or
desktop computer. It is handy because it is always with me.  It can
access the network from anywhere in civilization.  My Treo is a
organizer and scientific calculator. The advantage of Palm is that
lots of people have written software for it which makes it a
general-purpose computer.

<snip>

i whole heartedly agree.  I have an IPaq an though I don't believe that
the phone reception is a good as my old phones (heck nothing ever beat
my phone pack for receptions) it is much nicer to have a single device
to do all things.

I wish the ipaq was linux oriented but .. can't have everything

I 100% agree with you.  I've thought for a long time that Windows (or 
any OS) is just a delivery platform for applications.  Of course, it is 
more than that, but many people just need to use MS Office, or AutoCAD, 
or Adobe software, etc.

Didn't change anything (other than hiding the cursor completely), but it

That'd be a roger on that.  It's my "Just another convicted Perl hacker"
talk, which I've not given recently in Portland.  Google for the
description, because I'm too lazy to do that at midnight. :)

I'm hoping to have news by the meeting that will put an interesting capper on
the story as well.

Subject: [PLUG] NFS/CIF Annotation ( dia? )
Message-ID: <459BFD96.5020608@acm.org>

Is there something similar to ER diagram notation for NFS and CIF 
shares/mounts?

We have 20+ physical systems ( Linux, MAC, and Windows ) that share and 
mount drives.  Several of the physical systems are Linux-Vservers so the 
mounts are then _sub_ mounted -- from the host to the guests.  And some 
of the systems both share and mount.

I'd like to build a diagram of all these.

Is there any (semi-)standard way to diagram the shared resources and 
where they are mount?

Searching 'nfs|cif diagrams|diagramming' etc. gives no joy.


TIA,
Rod

Rod,

   Have you looked at building a network graph? I believe that Graphviz will
do the job for you. Each system can be a node, and the shared filesystems
and directories can be directed edges.

   While the results may look like a plate of spaghetti, with different
colors and line attributes it will all make sense. Perhaps.

Thanks Rich.  Very nice and I completely forgot about GraphViz.  The 
only problem is there was only one exmaple that came close to what I 
think I need -- fsm.

Do they still cause massive interfearence on ham radio bands?

They are slower than running ethernet cable and you may run the risk of 
getting beaten up by a ham radio operator.  Other than that, they have 
them at Fry's.

Rod,

   There's also the inet example.

   I think you can play with the dot file once you write that, and see how
different formats display the data. I've not had need for the application so
I cannot speak from experience with it.

   But, GraphViz is 18 in my unofficial list of vector drawing applications
for linux. Each seems to be slightly better at a particular type of drawing.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0701031303290.16930@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   For some reason, the sound went away on my main system. There is no
/proc/asound/. I reinstalled the alsa drivers, ran 'modprobe -a ac97'
because that's what lspci told me was the installed sound chip, and still
cannot get any results.

   What do I do to load the modules so that /proc/asound/ appears? That's the
first thing I need to fix.

Thanks,

I have someone here at work that has used a set but it is the first generation
stuff that was way too slow (but still faster than 802.11b).  The
second generation
stuff works pretty well (~85Mbs).  The third generations stuff is
starting to show
real promise to replace wireless in the home but is too expensive right now.

You can buy a handspring with a springboard slot for under $100 (more like $50):
http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=handspring+visor&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&sa=N&tab=wf

and with this:
http://www.palminfocenter.com/news/5608/magnetic-stripe-reader-for-palm-handhelds/

it even has the credit card slot.  (other springboard modules make it
function as a cell phone, gps, glucose meter... etc.)

There are a bunch of modules that get loaded for sound.

Run /sbin/lsmod and see what comes up.

On my system at home I get:

Of these, the "sndcore" module seems to load in the "snd" module which loads
in everything else.  You may have only part of the sound modules loaded.
ac97 is a codec, not a specific chip.

Check /etc/modprobe.conf to see what the system believes you need for
sound.  Here are the lines from mine:

alias snd-card-0 snd-via82xx
options snd-card-0 index=0
options snd-via82xx index=0
remove snd-via82xx { /usr/sbin/alsactl store 0 >/dev/null 2>&1 || : ; };
/sbin/modprobe -r --ignore-remove snd-via82xx

Hope that helps.

BUT if major power companies get in on the act then it'll really

:-) I wonder if Ham operators are equally skeerd of us?  Do they or

Yeah.  $50 for a pair right now.  The bits in this message are passing
over two I just bought.  I'm still at work, where we have a seriously
fast connection, and according to bandwidth tests I've run even these
archaic "Airlink 101 Powerline Ethernet Adapters" are way faster than
the DSL connection I have at home.  I like so far.  I'll test at home
tonight.  

It takes a utility on the supplied CDROM to turn on hardware
encryption, a requirement for me since otherwise my home network will
be open to our entire condo complex.  That utility is probably
windoze-only, but otherwise they're fine for Linux.

By that definition this is 2nd gen: box says 85Mbps.

Thanks, as always, for the quick responses.

   All I have is for the SCSI card for the tape and cdrw drives:

install sym53c8xx.o.gz

   OTOH, /etc/modules.conf contains:

# --- BEGIN: Generated by ALSACONF, do not edit. ---
# --- ALSACONF version 1.0.9a ---
alias char-major-116 snd
alias char-major-14 soundcore

alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss
alias snd-card-0 snd-via82xx
alias sound-slot-0 snd-via82xx
# --- END: Generated by ALSACONF, do not edit. ---

   But, when I try to run /etc/rc.d/rc.alsa start I see,

Loading ALSA kernel modules.
modprobe: Can't locate module snd-via82xx

   and when I run locate, I see that it's only in the 2.6.16 kernel and I'm
running 2.4.32. (I just built 2.4.33.4) and will install and boot into that
tomorrow morning.)

   So I seem to be in check mate.

Thanks,

   This former ham (W2TXT, and that's not a data format converter) was never
able to grow a ponytail when he had hair. It would fall out before getting
long enough.

   So now I let my eyebrows grow long and comb them back over my head.

You realize if your NFS/CIFS exports/mounts are that complex, you are

Perhaps because no one else was insane enough to build a cluster like
that?

I've been working through some PHP code that parses an XML file and came across this 
 xmlArray['project']['newsgroups']['newsgroup']['0 attr']['name']

I would normally parse
<newsgroups>
<newsgroup name="blah blah" />
</newsgroups>
as
xmlArray['project']['newsgroups']['newsgroup attr']['name']

The code with the "0 attr" does not appear to work (at least for me, but apparently for others it does.

Does anyone know what the "0 attr" means? Thanks.

Message-ID: <a4ba175e0701040014o505465fbsd8326554567b367f@mail.gmail.com>

Here is a little idea that I have been mulling around, I think it might work
and I would just like to get some input from some guru's.

My sister in law has two teenagers at home. The boy 14, doesn't spend too
much time on the net other than e-mail and myspace. Now the 13yr old girl is
a fiend. Every spare moment she has she is on the net chatting, downloading,
myspacing, staying up all night in front of the screen, etc, etc. I have
suggested many a time to remove the cable modem when my sister in law is not
at home or when she goes to bed. But she is lazy when it comes to policing
what her kids are doing on the computer. Thats a whole different issue that
I personally label as not interested in knowing what her kids are doing on
line. Makes me mad but they are not my kids. Anyway back to the "idea".

Here is a possible situation: Mom grounds kid from computer. Mom goes to
work and kids are still home. Kids turn on the computer and are surfing all
day long. Kids turn off computer before mom gets home. But what if mom was
able to dial a number on her cell phone and a voice says "press one to
disable network access, press two to enable network access". Network access
is unavailable until mom dials number and re-enables network access no
matter what account on the computer is logged on.

I have a feeling that this would have to be enabled in the modem, but what
if the program was installed on the computer and a very specific key
combination was the only way to open the program? I've been doing some
research on Google but the closest I can come are a few programs that block
access for a specific amount of time.

Has anybody heard of something like this, is it feasible? Anybody who has
any ideas on how or if, I would love to hear from you.

If she had a nice FreeBSD or Loonix router setup, she could install
Asterisk and connect to a VoIP telco (I've used Teliax in the past)..
- From there it's pretty easy to figure out what to do.

Kids are pretty "user" smart.  I bet they would just unplug a router and go
direct from modem to pc. Unless it was hidden, say in the garage or a closet
somewhere in the house.  Let me see if I follow what your saying.  Have her
call a VoIP number from her cell phone and have Asterisk configured to turn
on and off network access inside the router?  I would assume were not
talking about a router like a Linksys WRT54G, but a full blown box that has
been turned into a router.  I have a couple old boxes here and this is
starting to sound like a fun (at least in my head) project.

Assuming this is a Windows box, just configure it for a static IP and
give the kids limited user accounts. An attempt to directly connect the
computer to any modem would fail, and the router could be configured to
log the event (either when it boots up or when it has to renew the dhcp
lease when reconnected to the modem)

Well ... maybe ... but I don't think this is a technical problem. You're 
right -- kids are tech smart and they'll find their way around technical 
solutions. I'm by no means an expert on teen-agers -- the last time I 
was around them for any significant amount of time, I *was* one, and my 
father would have had a cow if I somehow managed to hack into the IBM 
702 in downtown Richland. :) But this is a behavior problem and not a 
technical one.

Did they even have modems in 1956? :)

Subject: [PLUG] Thunderbird running continuously??
Message-ID: <459D1E25.9020803@cesmail.net>

I've got a Gentoo Linux system, and I just noticed that Thunderbird 
appears to be using the processor to some extent continuously -- if you 
run "top", Thunderbird sits at the top of the list much more than I'd 
expect when it's sitting idle and minimized. Being a performance 
engineer, running "top" is somewhat instinctive, so I'm of the opinion 
that this is something that came in when the latest release (version 2 
beta 1) got installed. Has anyone else seen this?

Just to be clear, the technology I asked about, and some have commented
on, is not the same as broadband-over-powerlines.  The names are a bit
too close, and perhaps the home networking product uses some of the
same tricks.  But I haven't seen anything to suggest that it interfers
with RF transmissions.

I assume she could dial into a modem attached to a computer on the LAN
and enable/disable interfaces that way, but what's to prevent the
daughter from unplugging the modem cable?  (I don't know what software
to put on the modem; I have a winmodem so I've never played with it.)

Personally, I handle this sort of thing by looking at how much traffic
has been moved over the router at different times.  If my daughter's
looking sleepy and it turns out somebody downloaded 50M between 2 and
4 am the previous night there's hell to pay.

It may be that the naming is different between 2.4 alsa and 2.6.

Why are you running a 2.4 kernel?

   Because it works and I don't know what benefits are offered by a 2.6
kernel for my one server/workstation and the three portables. If there are
advantages, I'm not aware of them, and the 2.4 kernels are still the default
in Slackware.

   Also, when I tried building the 2.6.19 kernel yesterday the make failed.
I'll try the 2.6.18 kernel later today.

Thanks,

Rich

The main practical reason for automatically assigning IP addresses from a
pool is to serve mobile users.  Think of WiFi connects in a coffee shop for
instance.  Or corporate users taking their laptops when traveling to another
office location.

Then one of the kids will discover Knoppix, and she will just boot 
from a LiveCD. :-(

Ultimately, the only iron-clad way to prevent Internet access would be 
for Mom to physically disconnect the DSL/cable modem and ensure it 
stays unavailable (hidden, out of the house, or ...).

If tamper-evident is all the Mom needs, then, yeah, putting a decent 
password on the router and keeping an eye on the logs will do fine.

Thanks for all the input.
I've taken the plunge and purchased a Palm Treo 700p.
So far I really like the convenience of having a single pocket-sized device
to carry with me at all times.

Are you saying that if you want to turn kids into Linux hackers, create
a barrier to the Internet?

John Gilmore famously claimed that "the internet treats censorship as 
a defect and routes around it." So I suppose any Internet barrier 
creates hackers, Linux or otherwise. :-)

OK.  I don't use the 2.4 kernels because I need large file support.  (Which
i don't believe is in 2.4.  I may be wrong though.)


   Also, when I tried building the 2.6.19 kernel yesterday the make failed.

Or you could suck down the latest version using git.

Alan,

   My files aren't so large.

   I prefer standing well back from the bleeding edge. :-)

   Regardless, the sound used to work on this box (and my Sony notebook) with
the 2.4 kernels so I am really at a loss to discover what broke and why I'm
having such difficulties.

Thanks,

Rich

 I just want to say thanks for all the replies. It's nice to hear the way
other people would handle situations like this. Personally if it was my son
I would love to see how long it took him to find a live cd and bypass all of
my security measures on the box. That would make me one proud parent. But he
is only five so I think I have a few years until that happens. The only
thing he likes to look at right now online are Transformers. Little kids,
one track minds, priceless.

I think that removing the cable modem would be the easiest way to solve the
problem. Simple solution to a simple issue.

Thanks again

Subject: [PLUG] Study OS landscape...
Message-ID: <1167771822.27756.55.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have been trying to study what operating systems exist in the current
landscape and why.  I'm going to report briefly on what I found on
http://www.freeos.com/ and through google in general.

What I have for a list so far:

  *  SkyOS

     Syllable

     BeOS

     ReactOS
 
     Linux

     FreeBSD

     Freedos

     OS/2

     Solaris and other proprietary Unices.

     There are a lot of Microsoft OS'es...

     Novell Netware

There are some obscure ones as well:

     TOPS-10

     MIPS

     AmigaOS

     PDP-11

     ...

Don't know what SkyOS is all about, but I guess it is proprietary.
I tried to google to a web site for it, 
http://www.skyos.com/ wouldn't open up.

I do not understand what is driving Syllable.  Supposedly it is a
post AtheOS system, whatever AtheOS is.  I don't like the idea that
you need a Pentium to run Syllable nor do I understand why such a
big deal is made about integrating the GUI into the kernel.  The
blurb for Syllable is that it is meant to be an OS that is easy
to use in a home/office environment.  It is released under the 
GPL.  I ran into some X bashing.  Syllable runs on the AFS 
filesystem and apparently has problems with grub.

I know there is a BeOS bible, but I don't know much more than that
about this particular OS.

ReactOS is falling behind, 0.3.1 isn't out yet.  At least the web
site is back up.  This seems to be the only operating system at 
this time that is being designed to be a drop in Windows XP 
replacement.

Linux is being raked on freeos.com, a person who says he is 59 but not
a computer guru complains that while Linux doesn't leave him worrying
about viruses, it doesn't let him run much software either.  The
reviewer hates Windows 95 but he says that XP Pro right now is a 
better fit for him than Ubuntu.

I am impressed with gem in Freedos 1.0.  Anyone ever heard of or tried
seal?  Freedos is an MSDOS replacement that is apparently promoted by
Jim Hall.  The main reason for freedos apparently is that a number of
embedded software vendors still need a dos system.

OS/2 is on the list because I know it exists, but I don't know it's
status or anything else about it really at this point.

I am not an expert on Solaris et. al, but I have heard that Solaris is
good for music software.  I have also run into readme compiling software
under Linux which say that Solaris has brain dead compilers.

A screenshot of a Vista beta showed a 3D look.  Excuse me Microsoft, but
I don't want to waste the resources of my Cadillac on fancy windows.
The rumor that Vista is positioned to be anti vmware licensed has me
wondering why the ReactOS team is even bothering to create a build
environment for it.  Microsoft isn't cutting edge when it comes to
leaving the beta stage if Vista is behind schedule.  Rumor is that
Microsoft's SourceSafe isn't all that great and that it can take
months for something to get fixed right.  Claims that Microsoft is
too big and that IBM once was also seem to be swirling around the
Internet lately.

Netware is an interesting beast.  I don't know what the state of it is
today.  I didn't like a class I tried to take on Netware 4.0 at PCC.  
Netware seems to be an OS that doesn't offer a client, I guess the
client is supposed to be either SUSE Linux or Windows.

What irritated me is that a lot of web sites seem to be running a
Microsoft SQL Server ad.  I'm trying to look beyond Microsoft and
Linux and am sure enough getting bombarded with Microsoft SQL ads.
I think trains and ships have nothing to do with database
software per se, so I don't get the ads.  Is Microsoft trying to
say that Vista is so fat that you'll need a whole skyscraper or
a large ship to house the server that runs MicrosoftSQL server?

As far as a comment that Linux needs a universal installer across
all distributions to compete effectively with Windows, I dunno about
that.



Some interesting questions going forward:
-----------------------------------------

How can Linux support hardware better in the future and get away from
people needing to do manual configuration? ***

Are any of the non Microsoft and non Linux/FreeBSD operating systems
which don't pursue compatibility with a Microsoft product going to
flower?

Are obscure hobbyist operating systems worth any consideration?  Do
they make any sense?

If 32 bit Freedos becomes a viable option, what hardware will it 
require and how far will it go?  

Microsoft set out on a quest to take the command line away and 
eradicate dos in 1995, was it the right choice?  

Is the future going to be about 5 operating systems or many more 
than that?  ***

How are issues surrounding access to hardware specifications for 
proper driver development looking: 1, 5, 10 years into the 
future? ***

A system I didn't list, Minix 3, was that an inappropriate omission?

How many operating systems from today's operating system landscape are
missing from my list?

Should X be the only GUI platform for Linux?

The uncanny ability of one teenage girl to consume all available
communication resources, often simultaneously, has been noted since the
advent of the telephone.

ObLinux: Fellow I know set up voice conferencing on his Asterisk switch
at home.  Was a major hit with his stepdaughter and her friends.

Well, there ya go.

Me, I'd just set the router to share bandwidth fairly between the ports
to limit the damage to other members of the household, then make sure

I was referring to the fact that if you are using routed versus bridged
subnets on a /24 that you'd be looking at a total of 63 static customers
which his a waste of IP space IMHO unless they are paying a premium for the
service. Its entirely feasible to do bridged /24 static subnets as well.
There shouldn't ever be contention on a DHCP broadband network. You can
assign /23 or even larger if your customer base in that large.

You can do it without authentication. The company I work for has a PPPoE
product (which I detest but have to support) so I had authentication on the
brain when I wrote the earlier email. I think authenticated user sessions
are better IMHO because you have documentation on usage as well as
information you might need in the case of a MPAA or RIAA notice if the
company were to take them seriously.

There is such a thing as being too terse; an lsmod would've been useful.
Descriptions of other things that have changed since sound last worked
would have been even more useful.  It'd also have been nice to know what
"reinstalled the alsa drivers" means.

AC97 is an interface protocol between the chipset and the codec; its
driver is loaded automatically by the chipset driver, e.g. snd-intel8x0.

Can you move back to a working kernel or do you overwrite the old ones each
time?

What does lspci report as the chipset? Does it show up still?  Are you sure
the sound card still works?

   It _is_ the same kernel as before: 2.4.32. That's why I'm so lost in this.
Also, I cannot put a date or event when I discovered that I could no longer
listen to my small list of songs-to-work-by using xmms or look at news
videos (with sound) on reuters.com.

   Per my previous post:

00:06.0 Multimedia audio controller: nVidia Corporation MCP2S AC'97 Audio
Controller (rev a1)

   Yes, it works. The sound comes out garbled, but it's almost recognizable.

   There is no snd_via82xx in the kernel .config, in
/usr/src/linux-2.4.33.4/modules/drivers/sound/ or anywhere on this system.
But, there is in the alsa-lib package for Slackware-10.2. Considering that I
re-installed that yesterday, I'm surprised that I cannot find the driver. I
go look more.

Thanks,

Rich

   If I knew exactly when the sound quit working I'd have a much better idea

   This is probably the origin of the collective noun, "a giggle of girls."

   As I had but one son I was spared this anguish. But I learned to tune out
music I didn't like and kept the door to his room closed so I didn't see the
mess.

Sorry, I should've said "lspci", not "lsmod".  I saw your trimmed lspci;
like I said, it's possible to be too terse.

So did you try the module name that comes up when you go the Google URL
I mentioned in my last email?

Aaron,

   That's true. The search string is suggested on the ALSA troubleshooting
web page.

> So did you try the module name that comes up when you go the Google URL I

   I missed that. I went to the Google search results page, looked at some of
the hits, but didn't see a suggested module. Sorry that I didn't check
further.

Well ... I'm not going to answer *all* of your questions, but if you're 
interested in operating systems that are in moderate to widespread 
*current* use, there are a lot on your list that shouldn't be there. 
Here's the list off the top of my head:

1. Windows -- I'm going to lump all of these together, even though there 
are two Windows lineages, the NT/2000/XP/Vista lineage and the 
95/98/98SE lineage. And I'm going to include DOS in here, as well as 
FreeDOS. Basically anything Microsoft or a clone thereof.

2. UNIX-ish -- this is a broad category, but I think the major living 
dialects are Tru64, HPUX, AIX, BSD, Linux, Solaris, IRIX  and SCO. You 
occasionally find such things as Motorola 88000s running SVR3 and SVR4, 
but they're rate.

3. MacOS X -- technically speaking, this should be a UNIX-ish, but it's 
unique enough that it deserves its own slot. Besides, I need a place to 
put the previous versions of Mac OS.

4. IBM Mainframes: VM/CMS, VM/MVS, regular old MVS and zSeries VM/Linux. 
I don't know what the AS/400 OS is called; whatever it is, put it here. :)

5. OpenVMS -- I think there are still a fair number of Alphas running 
this, and maybe even some VAXes running its predecessor.

6. Really obscure -- I actually know people who still run OS/2 and CP-M, 
and there are probably folks running Unisys or Honeywell mainframes too.

7. Real-time operating systems -- it's been years since I knew any of 
these names, but they still exist. You can find variants of Linux that 
will meet hard real-time requirements, but I'm pretty sure others exist. 
In fact, there are a couple of projects that run Linux as a layer on top 
of a hard-real-time microkernel.

That's my list, strictly from memory.

DHCP offers many benefits period.  While mobile users and your coffee 
shop are two examples, they aren't the "main" reason.  It's a management 
style that each network admin will have to decide on their own. 
Personally I use a mixed environment on most networks I set up.  All 
servers, printers and appliances get static IP's which work well for 
managing, and the client machines all get dynamic IP's.  It's easy 
enough to start the DCHP pool at something like .50 rather than .2, so 
you can use .1 through .49 for static assignments.

I had this issue with my laptop after doing an upgrade of my distro. I use 
ALSA and all I did was run "alsaconf" from the command line. I nearly fell 
over in my chair when the test sound came out of my laptop at a rather loud 
volume.

The OS for the AS/400 (later called System i)  was called OS/400.
How's that for creativity?  Interesting machines and OS though.

I think at this point having always-on internet access at all might be 
something to reconsider.  Or at least use something that can be 
configured to manually enter authentication (ala dial-up), then keep the 
password a well kept secret.  Disconnecting and hiding the modem I 
suppose is an option, but entering a user name and password is much more 
convenient.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0701050303310.2617@shaft.bitmine.net>


So I bought one.  I got this fancy Samsung SyncMaster 215TW (and had my 
first wholly positive Fry's experience -- in stock and lower than 
advertised price.  Plus they let me plug it in and check it out in the 
store).

When I plugged it in, nothing happened.  But I think that was some sensing 
thing in my monitor when moving from the VGA to the DVI connector. 
Rebooted.  No big.

Immediate problem:  Console is in bad shape.  Looks really pretty, but 
only displays the top 2/3 of the screen.  It uses the full width, but 
thinks it's more square.  So can I change my console to 80x18 instead of 
80x24?  Or something?  It sure does look nice, though.

OK, so I let it boot without doing anything to xorg.conf.  It came up with 
a very pretty 1280x1024 box in the middle of the screen.  I log in and can 
use this lovely (did I mention how good it looks?) display.  But it's 
1280x1024 centered in a sea of 1680x1050 goodness.  How can I fill the 
whole space?

Well, first I just kind of see if X can handle it.  I ran dpkg-reconfigure 
xserver-xorg and selected 1680x1050 as the default resolution and 
restarted X.  What I got was ugly.  A strip in the middle of the screen 
maybe 600 pixels wide and what looked like my display manager login window 
peeking out of the corner on the far right of this region.  The rest was 
black.  And what was there was kind of stripy and not at all the normal 
order of things.

I played around with a few modelines and the horzontal sync and vertical 
refresh and got basically exactly the same thing every retry.

I looked into the html manual that came with this thing and found the 
following seemingly helpful data:

<quote src="manual">

Preset Timing Modes
If the signal transferred from the computer is the same as the following 
Preset Timing Modes, the screen will be adjusted automatically. However, 
if the signal differs, the screen may go blank while the power LED is on. 
Refer to the video card manual and adjust the screen as follows.

[bunch of modes deleted - J.]

Display Mode:		VESA 1680x1050
Horizontal Freq:	65.290
Vertical Freq:		59.954
Pixel Clock:		146.250
Sync Polarity (H/V):	-/+

</quote>

So that seems like something quite useful, eh?  None of the modelines I 
could generate gave me exactly that pixel clock.

Oh, and here's some interesting stuff from the failed xorg.0.log:

<quote src="xorg.0.log">
(II) NV(0): Probing for EDID on I2C bus A...
(II) NV(0): I2C device "DDC:ddc2" registered at address 0xA0.

(II) NV(0):   ... none found
(--) NV(0): HW is currently programmed for DFP
(II) NV(0): Using DFP on CRTC 0

(--) NV(0): VideoRAM: 65536 kBytes
(==) NV(0): Using gamma correction (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
</quote>

It then goes on to tell me information that leads me to believe clock and 
sync information is not being sent from the monitor.

Anybody have any nice suggestions so that I can use this beautiful, 
beautiful thing?

J.

Tony,

   Well, I managed to read one reply to my post on comp.os.linux.slackware
before the Aracnet news server trashed the entire thread. Well, I was able
to sustain the connections long enough to read a couple more replies.

   It turns out that ALSA is not included in the 2.4 kernels; that uses the
soon-to-be-deprecated OSS. But, Patrick complies and prepares ALSA packages
for the default kernel in the distribution. So, I have two viable options
(and one easily ignored):

   1) Build ALSA myself: easy to do since the source is on the distribution
disks (and the web repositories) and each includes a Slackbuild file to
build the package for me.

   2) Use a 2.6 kernel. Which I'll try on the portables first -- this
weekend. I will upgrade my server/workstation, too, to Slackware-11.0 and
can give the 2.6.18.6 kernel a try. I really don't care what kernel I run as
long as it handles my simple needs.

   And the other choice is to use OSS.

   Whew! I had no idea this was the case, despite not seeing the required
drivers in 2.4.32 or 2.4.33.4.

   My thanks to you and Alan.

Rich

Don't worry about matching the pixel clock exactly.  Within 1 or 2% 
should be sufficient.

Try using the vesa driver.  A quick search leads me to believe that DDC 
will work with that.  Vesa mode 12d might be what you need.  I'd get it 
working with vesa and scan the information in the X log  Then you will 
hopefully have enough info to make nv work.

My daughter avoided the screetching girl phase, thankfully.  (Partly 
because I would not put up with it.)

My daughter's machine runs Fedora Core 6.  She has dealt with computers 
most of her life.  (She learned how to correctly shut down a Novell server 
when she was in Kindergarten.  Since it was in her room, it was the only 
way she could get to sleep.)  I have also never filtered her net access. 
(I have taught her how to deal with the net as it is, not as some want it 
to become.)

I've had a similar problem on occasion. On one laptop, I have external
speakers plugged in, and so I can just turn the speaker volume control down.

It occurred to me that having a plug to insert into the headphone jack
would let me get the machine booted and the software controlled volume
turned down before letting the signal get to the internal speakers. I
assume that it would be a good idea to have a couple of resistors (8
ohm?) wired into that plug to present a speaker-like load to the
laptop's sound hardware, but I don't know if that's really necessary. It
would be one more thing to have to carry around, but it could prevent
unpleasantness on the bus.

I found when installed mine (the 205BW), after configuring the video
card settings I was still getting something like the above.  Sometimes I
had a clear 1280x1024 with discolored bounding box on the bottom and
right; sometimes it used the whole screen but was distorted in other
ways (including the mouse input being shifted by about an inch from the
displayed cursor).  I found that I had to use the (GNOME or Fedora, not
sure which) "Screen Resolution" tool, which I think manipulates the
XRANDR setting.  Curiously, the login splash screen *wasn't* corrupted.
Once I set this to the appropriate resolution, the display was correct;
it seems it was changing the resolution via XRANDR when the session
started.  You might examine the XRANDR settings and see if there's
something in the session changing them.

The 2500 has WIC slots; I believe there are ADSL cards available for it,
but they're ~$800, IIRC.  So, have at it.

I don't run Thunderbird, but what you describe is typical of my

Since speakers aren't a pure resistance, the eight ohm resistor isn't a 
good idea.  The speaker output should be okay without a load, so a bare 
plug would be fine.

Subject: [PLUG] Stero line input on a T42
Message-ID: <459ECA2E.6010008@dslnorthwest.net>

Hi! This is closer to a hardware question than a Linux question, but I
hope you can help me out anyway.

I would like to record line level audio from a stereo amplifier on my
Thinkpad T42. There are only two 1/8" audio jacks on the machine:
headphone and microphone.

The chip is an "Analog Devices AD1981B". The documentation for this chip
states that the allowed input voltage levels for the Mic input are the
same as for the Line input (not accessible on this machine), provided
that the "+20dB Mic Boost" is turned off. But when I try to record
line-level input through the microphone input, the apparent levels are
too high and appear only in one channel, even if the "Stereo Mic" switch
is turned on.

This same signal records just fine through the line input on a desktop
equipped with an emu10k1 card.

Is it possible to record stereo line-level input on my Thinkpad? If so,
how do I do it?

Thanks for any advice you can offer!

-Denis

This is flawed.  It's fine for a goal, but not for a means at a young 
age.  I hope what you actually meant, but just did not articulate well, 
is that you protected her via other methods.

Subject: [PLUG] Sound Issues: Almost Totally Resolved
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0701051548150.3845@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   For the record, here's the almost complete story.

   On my notebook (Slackware-11.0), the 2.6.16.36 kernel did not have the
requisite sound card driver. So, I built and installed a 2.6.18.6 kernel and
rebooted.

   Now alsamixer works, and the intel8x0 driver is loaded for the Intel card
(which is found and listed in /proc/asound/cards).

   I can play a music mp3 using xmms, but there's no volume control. Xmms
complains that the oss_set_volume() failed to open mixer device /dev/mixer.
But, there is a /dev/mixer as a soft link to /dev/sound, and they have perms
of 777. This is one issue to be resolved.

   However, I still have no sound with the videos on reuters.com. I've no
idea why, but this is the second issue to be resolved.

   Much closer. This weekend I'll upgrade the server/workstation and the
other portable to Slackware-11.0 and the 2.6.18.6 kernels and start working
my way through issues left on them.

I'm thinking no.

I tried Vesa, but didn't see a 12d mode.  Also, nothing at all interesting

Again, the `gtf` utility, which comes with X:

$ gtf 1680 1050 60

  # 1680x1050 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 65.22 kHz; pclk: 147.14 MHz

$

Might that mode line work?

*IEEE Seminar: SMP and Embedded Real-Time Myths*

*Abstract*

With the advent of multi-threaded/multi-core CPUs, even embedded realtime
applications are starting to run on SMP systems--for example, both the Xbox
360 and PS3 are multi-threaded, and there have even been SMP ARM processors!
As this trend continues, there will be an increasing need for realtime
response from SMP systems. Because not all embedded systems vendors will be
willing or able to create or purchase SMP realtime operating systems, we can
expect that a number of them will make use of Linux.

Because of this change, a number of real-time tenets have now become myths.
This talk exposes these myths, and then discusses some of the challenges
that Linux is surmounting in order to meet the needs of this new
SMP-real-time-embedded world.*Speaker Bio*

*Bio*

Paul E. McKenney is a distinguished engineer at IBM and has worked on SMP,
NUMA, and RCU algorithms for longer than he cares to admit (see
www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck if you don't believe this). He has recently
become quite interested in getting real-time response from mid-range SMP
systems. Prior to that, he worked on packet-radio and Internet protocols
(but long before the Internet became popular), system administration,
real-time systems, and even business applications. His hobbies include
running and family activities.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0701060722290.19804@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This is a minor issue, but one I'd like to understand and fix (if
possible). It involves the mail log summary about which I've written in the
past. The issue is that the cron jobs (plural) to run the script sometimes
miss a day, but either both run or neither runs.

   One instance is in /etc/cron.daily, the other is in root's crontab as

# run mail log summary just after midnight each day.
2 0 * * * /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm

   This morning, there was no mail with the summary. But, they both ran each
day from at least last Saturday. Other scripts in /etc/cron.daily run each
day at 0440 hours.

   While minor, it's an inconsistency that should not exist and I'd like to
try to find the reason so it can be resolved. If you have any ideas, please
let me know.

I haven't seen that kind of idle time usage with Firefox, /unless/
there is some animation running on an open page (or popup).  Some 
sites send backing popups that consume CPU time, and the 5% Firefox
usage showing in top is a good sign that one of the little bastards
is running somewhere.  So indeed it si a good thing to watch.

Subject: [PLUG] new printer
Message-ID: <20070106181648.GA8954@gate.kl-ic.com>


More fun with the power meter.   A few years ago, I picked up an old
Tektronix (now Xerox) Phaser 350 - a color wax printer - very cheaply. 
I don't print color very often, but it served for the times that I do. 

Then I measured its power use.  In spite of Tektronix's misleading ads,
the printer is NOT eco-friendly.  From a cold start, it needs about 10
minutes to warm up the wax ink before it can print, and in the process 
wastes a few CCs of it.  The alternative is to leave it powered up with
standby disabled, but that means it is consuming about 250 watts, or
about $180 per year of electricity.  

I hate inkjets;  they dry up and clog, and the supplies are very
expensive (compute the dollars per liter sometime - astonishing!).
The printed pages run if they get wet, and can stain other things.

So ... yesterday I bought an HP2605DN from Staples for $450.  Again,
the supplies are very expensive, but cheaper than inkjet and they
don't dry up.  The printer is reasonably fast, Postscript 3, 100BT
ethernet, has a duplexer, and a straight-through paper path so it
will be harder to jam.  There is a CUPS ppd file available.  The
printer consumes about 300 watts while actually printing (it looks
like an "instant on fuser") and 15 watts idle.  The toner cartridges
are "chipped" - they estimate toner consumption from the page count
and stop working even if refilled - but that seems to be true of
almost everything these days.  It was pretty quick to install, even
without specific Linux instructions on the CD, and including manual
reading for CUPs.  It has a web page interface built into the machine.
I spent more time at Staples trying to get someone to bring some paper
for testing it than I spent on install time back home (hint - bring your
own test materials, including card and label stock).  For now, it seems
to fill the need, but only time will tell if it is a good investment.

The most interesting alternative in the price range is the Xerox 6120N,
which is $300 on sale from Staples but only available for delivery.
It has more memory and allegedly a better image.  On the minus side,
it is a four-pass rather than a one pass machine, making it very
slow;  it consumes more power, and it has a lot more items to replace
in maintenance.  I did some calculations, and the extra wait time at
my hourly rate would exceed the price difference long before I use up
one set of toner cartridges.  Still, if anyone has one of these I
would be interested in their experiences.

I spent way too much time researching before the purchase, and many
machines dropped off the list - no postscript, no local supply of
toner, no gray-market refills, too slow, too expensive for my needs. 
Again, I am interested in the experiences of others.

Yeah ... I rarely see Firefox in "top". I just hope this goes away when 
Thunderbird 2 is out of beta. If it doesn't, I'll have to switch email 
clients -- that kind of resource hit is unacceptable.

Were you able to find after-market toner sources, in spite of the chip?

A couple of months ago, I mentioned that it would be nice to have a
customizable search page for a web browser, so I would not have to 
use tabs or bookmarks, just pick one of the entry boxes and hit go.

It turns out that the Google customizable home page is a reasonably
close approximation to my needs.  You can select from thousands of
mostly user supplied "gadgets", and build up customized page from
them.  For example, here is my current one:

  http://www.keithl.com/googlepage.png

I have search boxes for ebay, wikipedia, linux search, imdb, and local
information for movies, calendar, and map.  In my copious spare time,
I may design gadgets for Addall, the library, and telephone search,
and perhaps a "button box" that can call up bookmarks to CUPS, my
websites, and other places I go frequently.  

This isn't perfect;  most of the gadgets take up too much space.  But
it does get me 50% of the way there.  Nice tool.

If all you need is a simple way to query your favorite search engines,
then Firefox's "keyword" feature works great. Right-click on the text
entry box of any search form and select "Add a keyword for this
search..." Once you have the keyword search set up, all you have to do
is enter the keyword plus the search query into the browser's location
bar, and Firefox will send the query off to the appropriate URL. For
instance, you might set up a keyword search for the Internet Movie
Database such that all you have to do is control-L over to the
location bar, enter "imdb captain kangaroo", and be automatically taken to
the IMDB search results page.

Because of ongoing DMCA violation investigations, I can neither
confirm nor deny this allegation at this time ... :-)

Actually, there are many after-market sources, but they are not much
cheaper than store-bought.  Primarily I rely on the alternate sources
to put the brakes on HP jacking up the price too much.  Having lost
more money on toner-ruined clothing than I've saved on refills, I
tend to let someone else do it.

BTW, totally off topic, I frequent the Tektronix surplus store.  Many
years ago, they had a large bin of black toner powder for sale - 
perhaps 100 pounds of the stuff.  Two older fellows decided to buy it
for reasons we never could determine.  When they lifted it onto the
tailgate of the pickup truck, it fell, spreading a vast black cloud of
toner, coating them both black from head to toe.  I don't remember their

Message-ID: <20070107175652.GA30243@gate.kl-ic.com>


The following is more of a micro-HOWTO than a question or a complaint.
Hopefully, it will help somebody else (and help me remember it for
next time).  Corrections welcomed.


The CUPS printing system has a nice web page setup for new printers;
it provides the fastest way to change printer options or move a
printer to another interface or network address.  However, out of the
box it only works with a dozen types of generic printer.  What to do
if you have a printer with special features?  It may be postscript,
but what if it has multiple trays, or a duplexer, or ...?

The special features of almost all printers are described in something
called a PPD file.  Many manufacturers supply PPD files on the install
CDs - they are used by windoze and mac, too.  Also, you can go to a
number of sites to download PPDs.  I like www.linuxprinting.org .  But
where do you put your downloaded PPD, and what do you do with it?  I
have a 500 page book on CUPS, which says nothing about this.  So I
figured it out.  I think.

There are two directories containing PPD files in CUPS:
   /usr/share/cups/model/  # these are the generic models available
   /etc/cups/ppd/          # specific PPDs made for your own printers

If you modify a printer from the web GUI, it will only know about the
printers in /usr/share/cups/model/ , and will overwrite what is in 
/etc/cups/ppd/ .  So if you put your downloaded PPD in /etc/cups/ppd/,
it may get overwritten later.

So the appropriate place to put the PPD is in /usr/share/cups/model .
Typically, the PPD file you download will be an uncompressed file,
but the PPD files in these directories are compressed.  So you take
the downloaded ppd and make a gzip out of it:

  gzip  myprintermodel.ppd

... resulting in "myprintermodel.ppd.gz" in that directory.  The running
cupsd process still does not know about it though, so you have to restart
the cups daemon.  On my Fedora/Redhat machines, that is (as root):

  service cups restart

Now I can use the gui, use the modify button, and select my specific
printer model under the specific manufacturer's tab.

I don't know whether this approach will survive a distro upgrade of CUPS;
that may replace the contents of /usr/share/cups/model/.  So I save the
PPD file in my personal downloads directory.

There may be an easier way to do this, but the above works.  Now, go
out there and KILL some TREES.

Unfortunately, some distros disable the web interface per default. I believe 
this is the trend for Debian based distros (Ubuntu/Kubuntu for sure). To 
enable the web interface on said distros, add the 'cupsys' user to the 
'shadow' group, then restart cups (see below to restart). This is done via 
the following command (as root): 

gpasswd -a cupsys shadow

It is worth noting that files can be in subdirectories of the model 
directory, if so desired.

Also worth noting that ppds need not be compressed (.ppd files are also 
picked up) and it's possible to compile cups without gzip support, so 
probably best not to compress these files by default unless the existing 
ones are already compressed.

I believe you can cover virtually all distros with the command: 

/etc/init.d/cups* restart 

(This gets redhat, gentoo, debian, suse, (k)ubuntu...)

I have one, and got one for my mother because she has trouble changing 
inkjet cartridges and inkjets take _way_ too long to print a page. By my 
measurements, the printer consumes ~760W while heating, and <10W in standby 
running with 100mbps FD ethernet. While "Ready" the printer consumes ~12W 
with a 1 second 760W burst every 30 seconds, apparently all that's needed to 
keep heated. These measurements were made with a seasonic powerangel plug-in 
kilowatthour/ammeter, which may not be the most precise instrument. 

Also, I don't remember the rating in PPM but a 100 page full-color document 
takes about 3 minutes to print, and from standby to first full-color page I 
wait about 30-40 seconds. I'm no expert but I wouldn't call that "slow" by 
any standard. 

For my uses (replacing an inkjet), this printer is outstanding. It has a 
simple but effective web-interface even my mom can get around. And even 
printing from standby a single full-color sheet takes far less time than 
even the fastest inkjets, all at far less per-page cost with supplies and 
power taken into account. 

I don't know how onboard RAM effects performance, but I will say it's quite 
slow to print a full-page image at 600x600 DPI using postscript3 over 
100mbps FD ethernet. It probably takes 5 minutes before the printer even 
awakes from standby. (Possibly CUPS spooling on the server? Haven't 
diagnosed beyond observing the slowness) I haven't tried using the printer 
over USB or parallel but I can't see that being faster (though I noticed the 
USB interface is USB 2.0, not 1.0 or 1.1...)

CUPS: Common Unix Printing System (Paperback) by Michael Sweet 

The book is mostly oriented towards coders working on CUPS and filters
for same.  Usage information is only about the first 20% of the book,
not newbie oriented, and incomplete, as I noted in my post.  A newbie's
guide to Linux printing is desperately needed, but unfortunately I 
know nobody who does lots of printing, writes books, and understands
newbie mind.  ;-)

Actually, you do. :)

Unfortunately, classes start tomorrow, and he is going to be mentally
slammed for the next couple of months. :(

I did read the writeup and critiques of it on Amazon. You're right,
it's probably not what I need. What I really need is for CUPS to finish
growing up. For example, it does not know what to do with some of the
features of the printer that are listed in the PPD file. Hence, the
features are not available when printing from Linux. Also, I need for
applications to become CUPS-aware. Too many still require me to type in
an lp(r) command, and lp(r) cannot access all the features of my
printers either.

Good link

Thank YOU

I also found some others and think I will give it a shot...

So I can bridge with the 678 and do dhcp and filtering on the 2500

The 2600 series has WIC slots.  2500's pre-date WIC's, and were fixed
configuration based on specific model.  Most were a mix of serial (sync
and async), 10BaseT, Token Ring, ISDN, and pre-dated xDSL.

The only modular 2500's were the 2524 and 2525 which just started to
integrated CSU/DSU's for T1's and NT1's for ISDN, but not compatible
with WIC's.

The 2509/2511 make great console servers (8/16 port serial
respectively).  Handling anything higher speed than a couple T1's is
probably not recommended.  They are also very EOL, and 2600's are even
EOL now.

Since I wrote that, I have been having a fun time porting stuff to
Scientific Linux 4.4, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux clone .   There are
some programs that worked with 2.4.22, and work with >= 2.6.17, but
do not work with 2.6.9 . Fooey!

   However:

I also discovered that RHEL5 beta 2 is available (!) at:

  ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/beta/RHEL5-Beta2/

I made some CDs, and did an install on a spare drive, and RHEL5b2
more or less works.  The gnome logout process does not have a checkbox
for "Save Current Setup", but I've found no other annoyances so far.

So, new plan.  I will duplicate the SL4.4 drive onto the spare drive,
then try an RHEL5 upgrade on that drive and see what breaks.  If that
works, I may continue my upgrade/rebuild work on that drive.  

Many of the RPM packages currently installed by RHEL5 beta 2 still
carry a "fc6" identification, instead of an "el5" identification,
showing the close kinship with Fedora Core 6.  They appear to be
identical otherwise.   Besides some RPM naming differences, el5
and fc6 are about 80% similar, with some minor rev differences
on the remainder.  Very few big changes.

There is 99%+ similarity between RHEL beta 2 and the RPMs for the
"very alpha" SL5 .  Most of the differences are the SL5 extras,
and some are some configuration stuff (like artwork) and docs.
There will probably be more divergence when SL5 is finished.

Questions:  What are the implications when I do the final SL5 upgrade
when that becomes available?  Will RPM consider the package name
differences important, and perhaps fail on the dependencies? 
Anything else to watch out for?

I know that CentOS users have typically contributed how-to docs on 
migrating from RHEL to CentOS. I've never used Scientific Linux, but I 
suspect the procedures are rather similar.

The biggest differences between RHEL and its freely rebuilt clones 
have historically been package management and art work. I don't know 
about RHEL5, but its predecessors relied on up2date, while CentOS 
standarized on yum. The transition wasn't horrible, but any mistake is 
costly. Ripping out the Red Hat-copyrighted artwork is usually easier, 
and by now all the clones have their own art styles.

If I were contemplating your move, I'd

1. Install RHEL5 betaX and get everything working
2. Identify and backup the deltas between installation and working
3. Nuke and repave with a fresh SL5 install once it's available
4. Merge deltas backed up in step 2.

But that's just me...

I have been trying to dredge up a speaker for Advanced Topics on the 15th 
and have gotten back no responses. (I have a couple of people who I have 
been trying to contact and neither have gotten back to me.)

I have a speaker for February, but not January.  (Must be the hangovers.)

Anyone feel up to giving a talk?

Subject: [PLUG] root login
Message-ID: <45A3EEEB.7060506@verizon.net>

I am trying to install a program.  I am running Kubuntu Edgy.  The 
install program is a shell script (.sh).  The computer is an HP laptop 
with AMD 64 X2 and a 64 bit install of Kubuntu.  According to the 
program's tech support, I need a "real root login".  They say that 
(K)Ubuntu doesn't actually give you that.  They also said that 
"unlocking the permissions" would do the trick.

I have tinkered with the permissions in every way that I can by using 
kdesu konqueror and right clicking on the file.  I have tried to change 
ownership of the file.  A transcript of what I get follows:

robin at moose:~$ sudo bash
Password:
root at moose:~# ./CMMFS_linux_1_0_3_12.sh
Unpacking JRE
Preparing JRE
./CMMFS_linux_1_0_3_12.sh: 217: bin/unpack200: not found
Error unpacking jar files. Aborting.
You might need admistrative priviledges for this operation.
root at moose:`#

Some quick Google work shows this to be an error within the installer?
Any ideas will be greatly appreciated.
I want to finish setting up the wife's new laptop so I can have mine back.

Thanks,

Bruce

The above will run bash as root, but with much of your own user
environment.  Instead, try this:

$ sudo su -

This will log you in as root with all of root's environment settings,
i.e. a "real root login"

Some things sudo simply won't work for. Just give yourself a real root 
password:

$ sudo passwd root

Then use Real Root. Piece of cake.

You'll see a prompt for root's password. Enter that and you have a root
login shell at root's home directory. Using 'su' without the dash raises
your status to that of superuser, but in the current shell.

True for most Unix/Linux.  However, under {Ku,Edu,Xu}buntu and Mac OS X,
there is no root password:

$ sudo grep root /etc/shadow
root:*:13417:0:99999:7:::

So, typing 'su -' alone will not give you a root shell because there is
to password that grants you access to it.  One must use sudo.

As for su alone, that will not run root's startup scripts.  So, if there
are any special configurations to root environment, e.g. from
/root/.profile or /root/.bashrc, those will not get initialized.

   Wow! I had no idea. I've used only Red Hat and Slackware, and installation
is done as root, so we're asked to assign a password early in the process.
Strange. Very strange.

   And for many tasks, the root environment is not required.

I usually use "sudo -s" to get root in Ubuntu.  Not important, tho.

So you're missing "unpack200".  Google sez it's in JDK 1.5 or later.  
I don't remember which repo you have to install to get JDK; maybe it's
in Universe or Multiverse.

You might, but that's not the problem here.

This is for a Redhat-ian ( Redhat, CentOS, Whitebox, Fedora, etc. ) 
system using the SYSV init process.

I have a POE server I'd like automagically started when the system comes 
up.  What is the preferred method for doing this?

Actually I have no problem creating an init.d script but since this 
simple server doesn't do a lot of fancy stuff at start-up ( capture it's 
and write its pid and so forth ) I thought there might be a better way.

Searches of the web tune up nothing and the POE site doesn't get into this.


TIA,
Rod

If you aren't going to be starting and stopping this server with any 
regularity, the easiest way to start a process at boot time is adding 
a line or two to /etc/rc.d/rc.local. A process started that way won't 
start/stop when you change runlevels, but it'll always be there after 
bootup.

Hello all,

I was sitting in wireless cafe the other day and happened to look up at
the ceiling when I noticed a run of ethernet wiring. The wires were not
in a conduit or stapled to the wall, but rather they were held in place
by what I can only describe as metal pig's tails. That is, it looked as
though someone had taken a bolt, twisted one end into a pig's tail (or
corkscrew) and fastened the other end to the wall. The wire was running
through the loop formed by the pig's tail.

Does anyone know what these pig's tail like things are called?

i dont have my anixter catalog handy, but they are grouped in the 
'fasteners' section.

they are usually called bridle rings, and are used for small runs of low 
volage cable.. here's an example (with a saddle to help with heavier

strucuted wiring installation uses j-hooks, raceways/table trays, 
interduct for fiber, etc - don't forget out in p-town you have build for

Message-ID: <20070110191010.GA11582@gate.kl-ic.com>


The Madwifi drivers for Atheros cards seem fairly well supported by
Linux.  I purchased one previously at full price (about $50), and found
some refurbs in plain brown boxes at Frys for $17 ("WG511TNAR", which
means WG511T, North America tuned, refurbished).  For those of you
that want to pester the Linux Clinic with cheap wifi cards, here is
a cheap one that won't get taken outside and stomped.  I bought a
second one for my wife's laptop, and it works pretty much like the
new one.  It says 90 day warranty on the Fry's label on the box, and
30 day warranty on a note inside, so Fry's is, well, Frys ... :-/

I am still having some troubles getting "iwlist" (scanning) working
with the WG511T and a 2.6.9 kernel, but allegedly it will work and I
will get it figured out soon.  The more people that have these cards
locally, the more help in figuring it out (my ulterior motive).

I don't use one.  But a friend of mine was explaining that they were
using Excel to calculate NPVs in one of his business classes.  Would
OpenOffice.org's Calc do what you're looking for:

Atheros-based WICs are great. The newer ones support a/b/g, WPA2, and can be 
used either on the client side or in access points. Atheros opened up their 
drivers (MadWiFi) a few years ago, so they are solid and feature-ful. They 
are dual-licensed, both GPL and BSD.

Both the Atheros web site and madwifi.org have tables that list brand names 
and model numbers of WICs that use Atheros chipsets.

Ralink and Realtek are supposed to be fairly Linux-friendly, and Intel keeps 
making 'we luv Linux' sounds, but so far there's not much to show for all 
that lovin'.

Robert,

   I looked at my fiancee's HP12C and decided that the calculators are fine
for one time in the future, but not a range of time. So, I'm using my
spreadsheet application (XessSE, which I've used from before OO.o existed)
to do the calculations. It has the function @npv(i,t1..tn).

Thanks,

Rich

I ran across this on the GNewSense list- the ASUS WL 107g has 100% free 
drivers, there is no binary kernel blob like Atheros uses. The binary blob 
has to do with FCC regulations about not allowing users to dink with the 
broadcast frequencies. (This is the actual rule 
http://ftp.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Engineering_Technology/Orders/2001/fcc01264.pdf) I 
don't know why ASUS can do without the binary firmware blob, but there it is.

Even cooler, the card is cheap, $24.99 on Newegg. It has a Ralink chipset.

Just to rain slightly on your parade, MadWifi drivers leave much to be
desired.  That said, they work, generally.  They are not particularly
"opened up" however.  The current MadWifi drivers rely heavily on a
binary-only HAL, which is kinda-sorta-not-different than binary-blob
firmware except that it runs on your CPU instead of on the card.
Loading Madwifi taints your kernel.  Atheros is apparently not
especially communicative with developers these days, and the currently
available developers are kinda-sorta Not That Competent.  They try.  I
have found that they are particularly not interested in solving
documented configurations (admittedly not the Common Case, but an
important one for us at PTP) on which it is pretty easy to trigger
kernel panics.  Way too easy.  Because of the HAL, it becomes
difficult to fix.  There is some outside work on a branch using the
devicescape 802.11 stack (in place of the net80211 stack ported from
BSD-land that stock MadWifi uses) and also on integrating an OpenHAL.
I haven't tried any of that work yet.  I think you could say it was a
work-in-progress.

Featureful?  Yes.  Solid?  Not so much.

For client-mode, Intel hardware apparently works pretty well.  At
least, I've heard that.  I've got one of their a/b/g radios in a test
rig, but haven't had time to play with it much.  As of 6 months ago,
it was pretty close to impossible to find intel radios retail.  Were
only available as pulls from centrino laptops.  There has been some
work on master-mode on Intel hardware, but my attempts to get it
working have been thwarted so far.  Attempts to ping the developer at
Intel have gone without reply.

Using a Ralink chipset, and available from a local vendor (Pacific Solutions) is
the CNET CWC-854 for $32.

It's been a great card for me.

Hi all,

I don't know if this is the right format or the right way to do it, if this

At work we are looking for a php/mysql developer that help us fix some php
pages, it is not a complex site, is pretty simple, but we need someone with
expertise, we would pay by the hour, this could turn into an on-going task
and a source of some bucks a week for students or plug members.

I tried Craigslist but didn't work, plus I've seen what some of you can do
and I'd like to take advantage of your knowledge. If any of you is
interested please drop me a line or two.

Thank you, and again sorry if this is not the appropriate way.

The binary blob has to do with avoiding user-configuration-to-violate-
regulations while using a software-driven radio.  If the card is doing
the regulatory function instead of the driver, then you don't need the
binary blob.  That's the model, anyway.  I don't know anything in

Interesting stuff, thanks. It's like a squeezy toy- squish the belly and the 
face bulges. Move the binary blob around and around. So the kernel isn't 
tainted if the card does the regulatory guff- but doesn't that present the 
same problems with debugging and writing drivers as a HAL?

There was a scanning module that needed to be loaded that didn't happen
automagically for me the last time I used an Atheros based card.

I tried one of these cards in an old crusty intel based server I have laying
around and they *work* but caused weird slowness problems that weren't do to
CPU usage. On the laptop I'm currently using they work flawlessly though. I
agree with Russell, featureful yep, solid nope..

Well, a buggy firmware just means the device doesn't work.  A buggy
HAL means your kernel panics.

Yeah, I guess some are leaking out nowadays.

The other annoying thing is the difficulty in finding specs on the
hardware, like tx power and rx sensitivity.  This is what passes for
technical information from Intel:

  ftp://download.intel.com/support/wireless/wlan/pro2915abg/sb/303330002us_channel.pdf

It doesn't even say precisely which 802.11a channels it supports.
There are 3 separate 5 GHz bands in use for 802.11a in the US.  The
technical information doesn't say categorically that the card supports
them all.  No mention of tx/rx specs either.  PTP would love to have
alternatives to Atheros cards, but Intel doesn't seem that excited in
providing them and I can't tell why.

Kernel panics?  Hmmm... 

I am still in the middle of configuring a new system.  A couple of
times when I inserted the Netgear, my laptop froze.  So many things
were getting reconfigured and moved, I attributed it to operator error.  

However - could this be related to the kernel panic you talk about?
Could you provide a pointer to more details?

Uh, just the madwifi ticket system:

  http://madwifi.org/search?q=panic&ticket=on

Get to a text console and do your plugging when you can see the panic
messages.  

There may be people using madwifi-ng successfully in a client-mode
without panics.  On my laptop, I have been sticking with madwifi-old,
which *is* pretty stable.  Unfortunately, as of 2.6.19.x it doesn't
seem to be building cleanly anymore (so for now my laptop is on
2.6.18.x).  Based on the trouble I have had with madwifi-ng in master
mode and wds where "ifdown ath0 ; ifup ath0" is a pretty reliable way
to kill your machine, I've been avoiding -ng for my laptop.  Maybe for
not too much longer though.

I'm pretty sure all the Linux "office" suites will do it -- OO.org,

I guess that some people might be interested in the kdump stuff that
seems to be
getting some press.  In 2.6.19 you can now set a kernel that will boot
upon kernel panic
which can save a panic kernel for debug.  FC5 and FC6 already have the setup in
packages that can be yum installed.  A kernel core, config file, and a
hardware list
all sent to a maintainer when a system panics.

The HP12C is a dinosaur, a decade old at least, yet many people I know
in the real estate field are still using it. I still use mine. I keep
it within an arm's reach on my desk.

If you want to do NPV of a future cash flow, you are correct that it
can calculate only the present value of one future date at a time.
However, in the real world there are seldom more than two calculations
to make. 

For example, consider calculating the NPV of a contract with n monthly
payments followed by a final payoff at date n. To put this in real
world terms, suppose you wanted to calculate what you would be willing
to pay for a contract with seven years of monthly payments of x,
followed by a payoff of y at the end of the seventh year. You desire a
17% rate of return. The contract calls for interest at 8%.

To calculate this, the first thing to do is to ignore the 8% nominal
rate on the contract. It is irrelevant. The 17% yield you want is the
only relevant interest rate. Let us suppose, for the sake of the
example, that the monthly payments on this contract (which include the
interest at 8%) are $800. And let us further suppose that the payoff at
month 84 is $50,000. (You would calculate these just by doing a simple
amortization chart with the calculator.)

You would start by entering 17% for the i register (divide by 12 or hit
g before entering), $800 for the pmt register, 84 for the n register,
and then hit pv. This would give you the amount that $800 per month
would amortize to 0 in 84 payments of $800. This is the net present
value of the 84 payments. Save this figure in Memory1. 

Next, hit Clear All, then enter $50,000 in the FV register, 17% in the
i register (divide by 12 or hit g before entering), 84 in the n
register, and then hit pv. This will give you the present amount that
will grow to $50,000 in 84 months at 17% compounded monthly, that is,
the present value of $50,000 to be received at the end of 84 months at
17%. Add to this the amount in Memory1, and you have the present value
of the entire contract to an investor who desires a 17% yield.

I am sure you can do the same calculations with OOo Calc, the same as
with MS Excel, but I can complete the calculation with my 12C faster
than it would take to launch Calc or Excel. Even if I did not own a 12C
I would still search for a calculator applet with financial functions
like the 12C instead of trying to do it in Calc or Excel. Why launch a
whole spreadsheet when all you need is a couple functions?

I have recently installed several Kubuntu systems.
What I have encountered when using apt-get with a valid install command is
the following:
	[a bunch of output]
	A notice that it is trying to connect to 1.0.0.0
us.archive.ubuntu.com or
	a notice that it is trying to connect to 1.0.0.0 security.ubuntu.com

Only when I go into /etc/hosts and set:
	146.137.96.7	us.archive.ubuntu.com
	82.211.81.138	security.ubuntu.com
does apt-get run to completion.
So where is apt-get getting the IP address of 1.0.0.0 ??
I don't have a problem with other IP translations.

There's quite a story behind the not-so-humble HP12C. I don't remember 
all the details, but they can be had by searching the web. The main 
thread is that in the early-mid 1980s, HP made a number of calculators 
in that form factor. I forget all of them, but the three most popular 
were the HP12, HP15 and HP16. The HP12 did business calculations, as its 
successor the HP12C does today. The HP15 did engineering and scientific 
calculations, including the unheard-of at that time matrix and complex 
numbers. In addition, the same folks who designed IEEE floating point 
arithmetic did all of the numeric coding for it. The HP15 was an awesome 
tool. And the HP16 was for assembly language hex/octal/binary junkies -- 
if you spent your days poring over crash dumps, you had an HP16.

Well, times change, technology changes, and things get obsolete. The 
HP12, HP15 and HP16 were to be taken out behind the barn and shot. But 
apparently some big real estate company had just standardized on the 
HP12 and mandated that all their agents use one. Somehow, HP was 
persuaded to keep the HP12 alive, and the little wonder is still 
manufactured today. I don't know how many times I've walked by one in a 
store and said to myself, "I really should have one of those." But I've 
never succumbed to the urge. Somebody does -- no matter how many better 
business calculators there are, no matter how fast a Pocket PC or iPhone 
with an 80 GB hard drive and Excel gets, no matter what wonderful gizmo 
you can stuff in your pocket that's so much better than an HP12C, people 
still buy them and love them. I don't think it will ever die. I just 
wish someone had screamed as loud when the HP15 went end of life.

Things like this baffle me. Why do companies stop selling things their 
customers want? Like older versions of software, and then they killed the 
secondhand market. The publishing industry is notorious for not keeping 
titles in print, even when they are good sellers.

For the big companies there are costs beyond the cost of manufacturing.
Keeping the distribution channels open is very expensive. As soon as
sales go down the big box stores drop the product immediately. Big
retailers need fast turns on the merchandise. They cannot afford shelf
space that does not turn the product once a month, preferably several
times a month.

There are, of course, alternatives to the big box retailers.
Unfortunately, manufacturers' sales departments are staffed by
salespersons who would rather work on a big million-item order from
Wal-Mart than an order for 100 items from a small specialty retailer.
In fact, small retailers have a hard time even opening an account with
a distributor or manufacturer.

There is also a psych issue. The rate of gambling addiction among
people in sales is nearly three times the national average. There's
something in the psyche of a salesperson that always seeks the big hit
over working for bread and butter. Book marketing people are always
looking for the next Harry Potter. In consequence, they don't want to
spend time working on a tried and true steady seller.

The saga continues...

I installed the appropriate sun-java goodies and the program I am trying 
to install still gives the same error as above.  Unpack200 is there in 
/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/bin/unpack200, so the problem is the 
installer can't locate it...

Do I need to make a link to it?
If so, the appropriate verbage would be helpful.

however, you can add it to your path to make sure..
from the command line as the user you're using to do the install..

PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/bin:"${PATH}"; export PATH;

and it would probably be fine to set your java home as well

JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun; export JAVA_HOME;

adding this or similar to .bash_profile can make them permanent on login..

one thought .. did you install all three of these packages?

Why would you want "such a beast"?  You can get a good quality DVD 
burner for around $35 shipped to your doorstep.

Go to newegg.com and search for: nec dvd ram burner

The whole "but I don't need that" idea doesn't really apply anymore for 
this.  The fact of the matter is, you can easily find one if you look 
online, but why when it costs almost the same as the burner above?  I 
would imagine if you're stubborn a trip out to freegeek would be fruitful.

Hello,

Yes you can in fact still get CDROM only or DVDROM/CDROM read only drives
still.
Try a computer store instead of OfficeDepot/Max etc...

For ex:
http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?pfp=SEARCH&Ntt=dvd+rom+drive&N=0&Dx=mode+matchall&Nty=1&D=dvd+rom+drive&Ntk=All&product_code=305629&Pn=16x_DVD_ROM_Internal_IDE_Drive
House brand, but eh, the electronics inside are the same pretty much as most
any other.
DVD and CD read only.

But why not just get the whole enchilada, here's a no name DVD/RW double
layer (no label burning Lightscribe though)
http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?pfp=BROWSE&N=200765&Ns=display%5Fprice%7C0&product_code=340024&Pn=Internal_IDE_DL_DVD_RW_Drive

Or as mentioned NewEgg or FreeGeek might be good.

I wouldn't be so sure.. Since the package looks as though it's actually
prepping it's own version of the JRE ("Unpacking JRE .. Preparing JRE...")
and given that the path is not (1) absolute, nor (2) simply a single file
name, I'd guess that the JRE unpack / preparation is failing silently, and
the CMMFS installer isn't realizing it until it tries to run bin/unpack200.

If this were a path/missing program issue, I'd expect the error to be
"./CMMFS_linux_1_0_3_12.sh: 217: unpack200: not found" or
"./CMMFS_linux_1_0_3_12.sh: 217: $JAVA_HOME/bin/unpack200: not found" (with
$JAVA_HOME expanded).

The initial failure could certainly be due to permissions, or any number of
other things. (generally boiling down to a poor installer though).  And
however you look at it, it *is* generating horrible error messages.

ENU lists two Sony CDROM drives as in stock for $17, as well as six
DVD-ROM drives. FreeGeek would also be a likely place to get one. But,
they are rapidly disappearing off the face of the Earth. Why spend $20 on
a CD-only drive, when a writer is a trivial amount more and CDs/DVDs are
massively larger than floppies? (not to mention a semi-useful percentage
of the space of modern hard drives)

  The FreeGeek Store usually has cheap CD drives.  I usually buy two
at a time.  It's nice to have a spare if a drive goes bad.

You don't want the latest/greatest?  How Geeky.
You want to be able to get what you really want?  Like freedom of choice?

What's a freedom loving geek to do?

Try FreeGeek?

I ask y'all's forgiveness for the following spam:

Free Geek store.  1731 SE 10th Ave, open 11-7 today, tomorrow and Tuesday.

They have older untested CD drives for really cheap, and newer tested
ones for $5-$10.  They also have RAM, PCMCIA cards, USB widgets,
keyboards, CRT monitors and even whole Ubuntu Linux systems for $25.
The other day, I saw two CyberMan 6-axis joysticks.

They now take credit cards.

Upgrades, anyone?

Subject: [PLUG] Atheros and wifi cards - the story continues
Message-ID: <20070112194957.GA19612@gate.kl-ic.com>


Previous message was [ Fry's has refurb Netgear WG511T Atheros cards
for $18.  Works fine ... so far. ]

There were problems, and solutions:

The madwifi driver for atheros that yum installs for my distro doesn't
work very well.  I downloaded the latest sources from the website,
compiled and installed them, and they work OK.  iwlist scans properly,
too.  There were some lockups earlier, but those may have been
operator error.

Previously I had been using the Perl program "wlan-config", text-based
with a hand generated configuration file, to find access points and
connect.  You can configure it with all the information for a particular
node, including IP address and DNS information, or tell it to use DHCP,
or whatever.  More work to configure than others, but quite capable. 
I did have to tweak the Perl code slightly to deal with ESSIDs with
spaces in them. 

In any case, I abandoned it too hastily, because it used "dhcpcd", which
is not in the Scientific Linux 4.4 distro (Centos-like RHEL4 clone) I am
using.  However, a lot of other scanner programs I tried also use dhcpcd,
so I went through the effort to download the sources for dhcpcd and compile
them.  Compiled and installed fine.

So the whole tool chain appears to work.  I will go out and try a few
open access points today.  If they work, I will learn how to build
RPMs, and make some for madwifi, wlan-config (and its Perl dependency,
Config::General), and dhcpcd, and contribute those to SL4.4 contrib. 

So I am within epsilon of wifi happiness.  In time, I hope the kinks
are worked out of the Atheros drivers so others with differing needs
can find wifi happiness as well.

   How do I compare a downloaded source tarball with the downloaded signature
file? Comparing md5 sums I know, but this is new to me.

Hi all! 
Our email gurus just saw a demo on a product called PostPath. They tout that they are the only Fully MSExchange compatible mail server. It looks like they took Zimbra(which I run at home and LOVE!) and did quite a bit of work to it. So far I am pretty impressed. Just wondered if anyone here had heard of it or had any experience using it? postpath.com
Thanks!

My -version shows the same as yours, and which unpack200 showed the same 
also.  The sun-java5-plugin doesn't seem to exist in Edgy's repositories 
now.  Apt-get install returns the message that it is broken, obsolete, 
or no longer available (I did that one from memory, hope I got it 
right).  I am off to play dad and head for bed soon...will try again 
tomorrow.

Message-ID: <1168730972.18318.46.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to set up Horde Webmail IMP
on CentOS 4.3 upgraded to 4.4 via yum.

Here are the rpm packages that are being added to far for horde:

autoconf-2.59-5.noarch.rpm
automake-1.9.2-3.noarch.rpm
automake14-1.4p6-12.noarch.rpm
automake15-1.5-13.noarch.rpm
automake16-1.6.3-5.noarch.rpm
automake17-1.7.9-5.noarch.rpm

Before I continue this list, why are there multiple versions of
automake and should I really install all of them?

curl-7.12.1-8.rhel4.i386.rpm *
dialog-1.0.20040731-3.i386.rpm *
docbook-dtds-1.0-25.noarch.rpm *

postgresql-server-7.4.13-2.RHEL4.1 *

I don't think postgresql is initialized
properly.  I'm wondering how to find any
and all databases that exist currently so
I can delete them.  I don't know postgres,
but I want to learn it.

psutils-1.17-23.i386.rpm *

tetex-fonts-2.0.2-22.EL4.7.i386.rpm *
tetex-latex-2.0.2-22.EL4.7.i386.rpm *

Why do I need tetex anyways for Horde and
Webmail IMP?

xml-common-0.6.3-17.noarch.rpm *
xmltex-20020625-3.noarch.rpm *
xmlto-0.0.18-4.i386.rpm *

I assume that horde is xml based.  
Unless php needs these.

zlib-devel-1.2.1.2-1.2.i386.rpm *

I assume this is for compression.

Here are the horde packages these rpms are supposed to support...
horde-3.1.3.tar.gz
imp-h3-4.1.3.tar.gz
file-4.18.tar.gz
Fileinfo-1.0.3.tgz 

Doing horde's supplied test.php, everything comes up okay except
for the following:

PHP Module Capabilities

Mcrypt Support: No
Mcrypt is a general-purpose cryptography library which is broader and
significantly more efficient (FASTER!) than PHP's own cryptographic code
and will provider faster logins.
  * MIME Magic Support (fileinfo): No
The fileinfo PECL module or the mime_magic PHP extension (see below)
will most likely provide faster MIME Magic lookups than the built-in
Horde PHP magic code. See horde/docs/INSTALL for information on how to
install PECL/PHP extensions.
  * memcached Support (memcache): No
The memcache PECL module is needed only if you are using the memcached
SessionHandler. See horde/docs/INSTALL for information on how to install
PECL/PHP extensions

Miscellaneous PHP Settings

memory_limit disabled: No
If PHP's internal memory limit is turned on and if not set high enough
Horde will not be able to handle large data items (e.g. large mail
attachments in IMP). If possible, you should disable the PHP memory
limit by recompiling PHP without the "--enable-memory-limit" flag. If
this is not possible, then you should set the value of memory_limit in
php.ini to a sufficiently high value (Current value of memory_limit:
256M).

A link to my phpinfo information:
http://xerxes.robinson-west.com/horde/test.php?mode=phpinfo&url=%2Fhorde
%2Ftest.php

These weren't added for Horde, but they are the CentOS packages that
give me apache:

httpd-manual-2.0.52-28.ent.centos4
httpd-suexec-2.0.52-28.ent.centos4
httpd-2.0.52-28.ent.centos4

Any help resolving horde's test.php warnings will be very much
appreciated.  A question, do I need to custom compile apache 
or anything else on the rpm list so far?

The pecl people need to fix their web site and their

I think there's a package called "rpm2cpio" that extracts a cpio archive 
from an RPM. After you get the cpio archive, you can get the file you 
want using (pregnant pause) cpio.

I found this <http://www.kalamazoolinux.org/presentations/19990831/> 
link. It suggests

To extract files from a RPM file to a directory without installing it.
    "rpm2cpio" archives the files to standard out in CPIO format.

    Example:  
	cd wip/foo
	rpm2cpio foo-2.0.i386.rpm | cpio -ivmud

Another easy way to view and extract individual files in an rpm is to 
use mc (Midnight Commander).  It understands rpm and cpio, as well as 
tar.gz and tar.bz2.

Subject: [PLUG] HORDE 3.0.3 awful...
Message-ID: <1168809333.10843.16.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Trying to get mcrypt installed so I can get memcache and fileinfo on, I
end up connecting the centosplus archive and get a different version of
php that horde doesn't seem to like.  Oops, I need domxml and php 5.1
doesn't have it.  I don't know what centosplus is for, but already I
don't like it.

Good grief.  Horde's wiki should tell you that horde on CentOS doesn't
work in their CentOS instructions.

Is it the 2.8 or the 3.0 horde framework, a version that actually 
works (at least on a valhalla system).  I wonder if I can install
an older version to CentOS.

I'm trying to install on CentOS-4.4 with the stock apache.  I'm
beginning to think you can't use the stock apache and php 
packages on CentOS with horde.

Maybe I should give up and grab squirrelmail.

Is there any way to get the fileinfo pecl extension 
installed to the stock php-4.3.9 

Why in the following excerpt after I upgraded to php-5.1
from centosplus is pear acting like nothing is installed?

Is it just me, or does php 5.1 not work at all?

I'm new to postgreSQL.  I'm trying to use with horde-3.0.3.
Following the instructions to create the horde database, I'm
wondering where on the filesystem it is located at.

I figured out that psql -l lists what databases exist, but now
how do I list the locations of all the databases that are 
created by postgres?

I figured it out, it was from the pecl web site.  I ran
into another problem with php5.1 trying to do
pecl install fileinfo.  Turns out that a message that
the c pre processor in insane may mean that the C++ 
compiler installed.

I know what a compiler is, but I can't do anything 
with a, "the c preprocessor is crazy," error 
message.  Hello pecl maintainers, the lack of
documentation and obscure error messages is 
really something else.

Why is virtual directory support disabled?  Do I need it if I'm

Message-ID: <1168818897.10843.41.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm planning to use PostgreSQL with horde and IMP.

Question is, should I set up LDAP on the physical 
mail server?

Can LDAP ease remote synchronization of web browsers?
Say I want all my bookmarks in firefox without having 
to physically copy them from one machine to another.

Does LDAP work if you want to have differing user 
accounts from one machine to the next?  For example,
an RDBMS will only exist on 2 out 3 servers and I 
don't want a postgres user on one of them.  I also
like to vary the root password across these three
servers so that someone guessing it only gets access 
to 1 and not all 3 machines.

Does anyone know of a really good guide to help me decide
if LDAP is something I should add or not to my network?

I've used them quite a bit.  If you're concerned about the 
binaries, build from the source RPM.  Last I looked, "phprpms" 
don't have their own source at all- they reach into the stock PHP 
RPM's source, build the module and then cherry-pick the output into 
an RPM.  It's a simple recipe, and I've used it to build lots of 
RPMs for modules omitted from the default RedHat PHP build.

Another option is to rebuild the system PHP to include mycrypt or 
any other modules you'd like.  You might be able to turn on modules 
from the --rebuild command line (read the .spec), or failing that 
just edit the spec to include what you like.

The outcome is the same, but I usually prefer the first approach, 
if only to be able to quickly see that a system has a custom PHP 
setup just by looking at the output of 'rpm -qa'.

Cheers,
Jason

On Redhat and probably most Linux, the location for the system
PostgreSQL tablespace is /var/lib/pgsql/data.  The databases are in
subdirectories under /var/lib/pgsql/data/base named after the OID of
the database.

   While I'm much closer to getting multimedia playing correctly here, I'm
not yet there.

   I've upgraded two of three systems to Slackware-11.0; one's running the
2.6.18.6 kernel, the other's running 2.6.19.2. On both systems, xmms plays
audio just fine. On both systems, the firefox-1.5.0.9 media connectivity is
installed and calls for mplayer to be used with the various video formats.
The videos display, but silently. I've tried (g)mplayer and (g)xine; both
display the video but no audio. This holds for the reuters.com news site and
downloaded videos as tests.

   If someone here can suggest a mail list, web site, or Usenet newsgroup
when I might find some help, I'd appreciate the pointers.

TIA,

Rich

Aaron,

   Here's what's currently loaded:

snd_intel8x0
snd_ac97_codec
snd_ac97_bus 
snd_pcm_oss 
snd_pcm 
snd_timer 
snd_page_alloc
snd_mixer_oss 
snd 
soundcore

   Both alsamixer and aumix have the volume up so the music is audible on
xmms.

Subject: [PLUG] Network storage
Message-ID: <20070115162101.2c505e42.johnxj@comcast.net>

I have decided I want to get a network storage drive. My house is wired
for 10/100 ethernet (actually gigabit, but my computers can only do
100, so that's moot). I'm thinking of at least 250 GB, but more is also
nice. I recall someone here recently bought such a device. Naturally, I
want it to be visible from my Linux laptop so I can make backups to it
with rsync. 

Here is one I found on eBay:

http://cgi.ebay.com/400-Gb-Network-Attached-Storage-NAS-Hard-drive-Maxtor_W0QQitemZ130068624668QQihZ003QQcategoryZ106273QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem

In case that link doesn't work, it's item # 130068624668.

I currently have a 250 GB USB 2.0 hard drive hanging on my Windows 2000
desktop. I have spent the better part of a day trying to learn how to
get rsync to write to it. I can read and write to it with Nautilus, but
the command line syntax escapes me. I use the Windows box so little
nowadays that I am going to shut it down and restart it only once a
month or so when I need it. I could then move the USB drive to my Linux
laptop, except that there's something screwy with my USB ports when I
send a large amount of data -- I get frequent lockups. Plus, eventually
I want to build myself a Linux desktop and it needs something to back
up to as well. A network device seems the easiest solution.

Recommendations, anyone?

You need the oss to alsa module installed.  Those apps tend to use OSS by 
default instead of ALSA.

You need the oss to alsa module installed.  Those apps tend to use OSS by 
default instead of ALSA.

Depends on your objective.
If you have a spare computer lying around then I would recommend freenas.
If you want a simple NAS device that you can just plug your USB drive into then
I would go with the Linksys NSLU2 or any of the other supported devices from the
http://www.nslu2-linux.org/ web site.

Alan,

   Thank you. I made sure that OSS compatability was included. Now I'll go
find an oss->alsa module.

I've been mulling over the best way to do something like this as well. 
One of the problems I am trying to overcome is power consumption. 
Running a fill fledged tower as Larry mentioned isn't an option for me. 
  I look at all the computers running around me all the time at my home 
and my electrical bill and it's just not right. ;)

The other thing I need to address is redundancy.  Hard drives just hold 
too much darned info these days.  The time it would take to rebuild most 
of what I have now from a total loss just makes me shake my head.  I 
don't have any performance requirements that a RAID-1 couldn't handle, 
and there are 2 and 4 drive NAS units that I've seen that would work 
great for the home.  Here are some nice looking unit's, but alas, not NAS.

   http://search.ebay.com/sans-digital

That's some sexy tech right there.  Now if they would just release a 
matching mini-itx chassis to sit on top of that...

This leads to the other option to build a low power machine using 
mini-itx as the base, and an external USB/1394/eSATA attached RAID-1 
chassis.  This would offer more possibilities and wouldn't kill the 
electric bill, and I could leave more machines turned off.  But, it's 
more money upfront.

Dan, Alan, et al.:

   Updating the Flash plugin to 9beta did the trick.

   I'll try your other suggestions Real Soon Now, but the updated plugin
seems to have been what was missing.

Thank you both very much,

   dmix is included with alsa-1.09rc<something> and up. I've 1.0.11 installed
so dmix is already in place.

Terry,

   Both of those files date back to Oct. 2004. They're the same on both
hosts.

   I can ping each one from the other.

   However, I messed things up by copying the contents of the workstation's
/etc/ssh/* and ~/.ssh/* to a USB thumb, and then to the notebook. The keys
no longer are correct.

   Guess it's time to regenerate my DSA/RSA keys on all three hosts and copy
the public ones to ~/.ssh/known_hosts on each box.

1. Check your /etc/hosts.deny and /etc/hosts.allow file for being too

2. Check your name resolution to make sure that the workstation and
notebook host names are resolving correctly from each others point of

Try looking at

     http://www.snailbook.com/faq/libwrap-oops.auto.html 

or otherwise googling.  This is probably the result of an incomplete
upgrade, and a library is missing or broken.  The logs will have a
lot more information, and you may want to turn on some debug flags.

I just came down off a two week spate of upgrades (mixed in with other
major and minor life crises) and I must have spent 40 hours of it with
google, solving issues like yours.  To keep the search focused, try:

      http://www.google.com/linux

This will keep the hits focused on Linux, and it seems to be somewhat
better sorted for answering sysadmin questions.  You are a Slackware
guy, and doing a Slackware upgrade, so the Slackware-oriented lists
will probably be overflowing with fixes for recent upgrades.  If I
am trying to solve Redhat-related problems, those are the lists and 
sites I look at first.

This list isn't the best place for answering the "what does it mean
if I get error message XXX?"  The list is better for judgement and
experience issues, like "is application XXX better than YYY?"  We
probably won't give you a "best" answer, but you are likely to get
some extra input to help you make decisions.  Your past questions
about applications have led to some fruitful discussions.

Answering a question about an error message on this list - incompletely
or incorrectly - just adds to the noise that the next person searching
through google has to wade through.  

If you still have issues, stop by the Linux Clinic next Sunday.  You
can get a couple of questions answered, and more importantly you know
enough about Linux to answer one or two questions of others.  Between
all of us, we do a lot of learning and helping there.

Keith,

   Further poking and proding tells me that the RSA/DSA keys got out of sync.
So I've taken down Mick Bauer's "Building Secure Servers with Linux" to
remind myself exactly how to run ssh-keygen. I'll regenerate the keys on all
three hosts, then copy them around on the USB thumb drive. That should fix
things up. If not, I'll go back to Google.

   I used to go to the clinics. Perhaps I can make the time to do so again.

   One of the things I learned this weekend is when a full upgrade (including
''--install-new'') puts sendmail on a system running postfix as the MTA, the
mail system _really_ blows up until a couple of files are replaced from the
backup tape and the link from /usr/bin/sendmail to /usr/sbin/postfix is
recreated.

Thanks,

Rich

Check the permissions on the .ssh directory and on any files in that 
directory.

It has to be 0700 for the directory and 0600 for files/keys.

   Thank you, Alan. That's been the permissions and they haven't changed.

   I'm going to see if I can find a mail list or newsgroup for OpenSSH.

   The situation is rather asymmetrical: I have three hosts on the network, 1
desktop (server/workstation) and 2 portables.

   The server can ssh to each of the two portables.

   The two portables can ssh to each other, but not to the desktop.

   Haven't tried scp again. I think when I fix ssh, scp will also be fixed.

Rich,

Does the -v option work like ssh?  Another check is to do ssh -v to see
what authentication does.

BTW, host.allow and host.deny are not checked by ssh/scp commands.

Ken,

   When I run 'ssh -2 -vv salmo' I get the same results: it first tries
version 1, then version 2, then fails. No more information on why it's
failing than without the verbosity.

   I've sent a subscription request to the SSH mail list. When I resolve the
issue I'll post back here so the thread's complete.

Thanks,

Rich

   What should I have in pg_hba.conf to get horde working?
I've enabled tcp_ip connections in postgresql.conf.

   I want to use database authentication for horde 3.0.3.
I see a table, horde_users.  I've learned how to put clear text
strings into field user_uid and user_pass.  I'm ignoring the
other two fields in the horde created postgres DB table.



Below is my current /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf:
local  all    all             ident   sameuser
host   all    all           127.0.0.1 255.255.255.255 password

Apparently, I'm not supposed to change the local record.  However,
I don't want to use ident at all.  I also don't want to break
using psql from the command line.  I found some manual for Lithium
on CentOS through google, which is how I got a needed hint on how 
to turn on tcp connections and that I should look in pg_hba.conf.

I'm guessing that I should use password instead of trust.  I'm horde=#
\du
              List of database users
 User name | User ID |         Attributes
-----------+---------+----------------------------
 horde     |     100 | superuser, create database
 postgres  |       1 | superuser, create database
(2 rows)

assuming that horde is connecting to the database if the php login 
page is telling me that I'm not giving the correct credentials and 
I'm not seeing failed to connect to DB errors.  Where do I look or 
how do I look to see horde login failures and troubleshoot them?  I 
want to see how the database and, for that matter if, the database 
is being accessed.

I'm interested in trying to get database authentication instead of IMAP
authentication working from the standpoint of being able to limit who
can use Webmail IMP.  For example, do admin and root users need Webmail
support?



I've manually added entries to the horde created database.
I can get the following output by doing:
 su - postgres
 $ psql horde
horde=# SELECT * FROM horde_users;
   user_uid    | user_pass |
---------------+-----------+
 horde         | ice022972 |
 michael       | dahlia    |
 administrator | postblue  |
(3 rows)

horde=#

NOTE: I trimmed off the soft expiration date and the hard expiration
date fields because they don't fit and I left them empty anyways.



What about these users???

horde=# \du
              List of database users
 User name | User ID |         Attributes
-----------+---------+----------------------------
 horde     |     100 | superuser, create database
 postgres  |       1 | superuser, create database
(2 rows)

How do I dump the passwords for these two accounts
and what attributes does the horde user really need?
The postgres database user doesn't have a password
right now but the horde user should.



ASIDE:  Why does the Horde team put people in the 
position of practically needing to rebuild both 
the database and the php implementation without 
even informing anyone about this in their wiki?
For the longest time, I didn't even realize that
a C++ compiler is needed to install the pecl 
extension fileinfo with horde's.  The wiki says
nothing in it's CentOS installation part about
how to connect the centosplus repository, 
etcetera.  Why is centosplus not connected to
yum by default?

On my mirror web site, do I want to replicate my database?
If I do that, how do I make the two databases sync so that
a change on one results in a change on the other?

Subject: [PLUG] MD5 hash a string...
Message-ID: <1168910473.13699.46.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I got horde working.  Turns out, I had to put the password for
Administrator in horde's horde_users table in MD5 hash form.
I ended up using a web based tool someone kindly put up to get 
the hash.  After that, the php administration page allows adding
additional users.

My question, what tool on a typical Linux box will dump the
MD5 hash of a string?  Is there a way using the psql tool to 
enter the hash of a string instead of the actual string?
Is there a special INSERT command?

Subject: [PLUG] Horde IMP
Message-ID: <1168915915.13699.70.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm using horde 3.0.3.

Horde is configured to use postgres for authentication.

Question, what is the difference between php sessions
and postgresql sessions?  Anyone playing with the 
custom sessions option of horde?  What reason is their
to use more than one database with horde?  I'm using
php based sessions because that is all I can get to 
work.  

I've set tokens to go to horde_tokens in the database
and virtual file storage is set to horde_vfs in the
database.  Do I need more than just the IMP and HORDE
packages to support attachments?

Should magic be set to /usr/share/magic?  There seems
to be more than one magic file on my CentOS 4.4 server.
For mime magic, is the magic from the file rpm the one
I want?

Another question, is there a simple way to do per horde user,
"email account you are allowed to log into via IMP"?
If I set up user foo in horde with password bar, lets say I
only want to let foo connect via IMP to email account 
foo at some.domain.  If foo attempts to connect to any other 
account on the email server via IMP, I want to reject that 
even if the right credentials are entered.  The idea is that 
you can log into the email account that is associated with your
horde account and only that one.

It depends. If sshd (or any other network server for that matter) is built
with tcp_wrappers then it checks hosts.allow and hosts.deny. If built
without tcp_wrappers then it doesn't.

On RedHat-based distros sshd it is built with tcp_wrappers.

That is something I am considering also. That's why I've decided to
turn off the Windows 2000 desktop machine except when I need to use it.
These days that's really only an hour or so once or twice a month.
Leaving it running all the time just for that is nuts. Plus, when I
built it five years ago it needed serious power because of all the
stuff in it -- I had to get a case with a 500 watt power supply. 

I also considered RAID, but that isn't necessary for me. These days I
use my Linux laptop for almost everything, but many days go by where
the only changes are a few added saved e-mails, changes to my Firefox
bookmarks and the like. In other words, I don't even need a regular
scheduled backup system, let alone mirroring. It would make more sense
to me just to use an rsync command on an as-needed basis.

I wish that the USB on this laptop wasn't so flakey. I've fiddled with
a lot, but it still locks up the computer whenever I send a lot of data
over it. I don't know if it's a bug in Dapper amd-64 or a hardware
problem. If it were reliable I'd just move the USB drive off the
Windows computer and use it on the laptop. 

Last night at Advanced Topics someone mentioned that the fact that
Nautilus can read and write to the USB drive on the Windows desktop
doesn't mean it is mounted. Well, I revisited the man pages and wikis
and stuff and last night was actually able to mount it. (It shows up
with the mount command now.) It took awhile, but the following did it:

sudo mount -t smbfs -o username=jcj //Devil4/Linux_Backups /media/smb

And then I tried what I thought was a proper rsync command to rsync the
whole laptop partition to the folder /laptop on the Linux_Backups
partition on the USb drive:

jjj at Devil5:~$ sudo rsync -a --exclude=/proc / /media/smb/laptop

But that got me a lot of failures:

rsync: readdir("/media/smb/System Volume Information"): Permission denied (13) 
rsync: symlink "/media/smb/laptop/cdrom" -> "media/cdrom" failed: Operation not permitted (1) 
rsync: symlink "/media/smb/laptop/initrd.img" -> "boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-26-amd64-generic" failed: Operation not permitted (1) 
rsync: symlink "/media/smb/laptop/initrd.img.old" -> "boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-25-amd64-generic" failed: Operation not permitted (1) 
rsync: symlink "/media/smb/laptop/lib64" -> "lib" failed: Operation not permitted (1)
<a dozen more symlink errors deleted for brevity>
Stopped  sudo rsync -a --exclude=/proc / /media/smb/laptop

So I stopped the rsync command at this point. Walking over to the
Windows computer I looked at the USB drive in Explorer and, sure
enough, it copied files and folders before I stopped it.

So it's sort of working. If I can get the rsync command to work the way
I want it to, maybe Ill just forget about the NAS drive and boot up the
Windows desktop whenever I want to do a backup to the USB drive.

I notice that almost all the errors were symlinks. I re-read the man
page on rsync, but I'm not sure how to fix this. I also don't know what
"System Volume Information" (line 1 above) is.

While re-reading the rsync man page it also occurred to me that I need
to exclude /media/smb and also another partition on the laptop, hda3,
which is mounted at /media/hda3. I can't figure out if I need to make
additional -- exclude statements for these, or if I can concatenate
them somehow. The rsync man page is pretty daunting for a command line
dumbass like me. But I know that once I get it right I can save it to
my CheatSheet.txt file. 

My goal is to make the copy on the USB disk basically a mirror of the
laptop partition. Rsync would run pretty fast since it only needs to
add/update what has changed. And that way I will always have a complete
copy of my Dapper installation. I keep remembering when I accidentally
deleted /bin. :(

I'm going to google some more on rsync. Meantime, I could use
suggestions on how to fix the above command.

Jason,

Here is another possibility:
Convert the Win2K FS to FAT32 (vfat) and load Linux on it as a dual boot.
When you power up your Win2K system booted to Linux you can fsync directly
into the Win2K partition.

So I stopped the rsync command at this point. Walking over to the Windows
computer I looked at the USB drive in Explorer and, sure enough, it copied
files and folders before I stopped it.

So it's sort of working. If I can get the rsync command to work the way I
want it to, maybe Ill just forget about the NAS drive and boot up the
Windows desktop whenever I want to do a backup to the USB drive.

I notice that almost all the errors were symlinks. I re-read the man page on
rsync, but I'm not sure how to fix this. I also don't know what "System
Volume Information" (line 1 above) is.

While re-reading the rsync man page it also occurred to me that I need to
exclude /media/smb and also another partition on the laptop, hda3, which is
mounted at /media/hda3. I can't figure out if I need to make additional --
exclude statements for these, or if I can concatenate them somehow. The
rsync man page is pretty daunting for a command line dumbass like me. But I
know that once I get it right I can save it to my CheatSheet.txt file. 

My goal is to make the copy on the USB disk basically a mirror of the laptop
partition. Rsync would run pretty fast since it only needs to add/update
what has changed. And that way I will always have a complete copy of my
Dapper installation. I keep remembering when I accidentally deleted /bin. :(

I'm going to google some more on rsync. Meantime, I could use suggestions on
how to fix the above command.

It will take the MD5-encrypted password, which is needed for restoring
dumps, but it will calculated the MD5 hash from the password.

I'd consider that if I had not finally figured out how to mount the USB drive. Now that I have I can read/write to it from the command line, even if it is hanging on a Windows 2000 computer. So there is no need to install Linux on the Windows 2000 desktop computer.

Right now all I need to do (I think) is figure out how to fix my rsync command. At this time it is:

sudo rsync -av --delete --exclude=/proc --exclude=/media / /media/smb/laptop

It copies the files to the /laptop folder on the USB drive -- Windows 2000 sees them there, so I know they are really there, not just copied to the mount point. (Why does Nautilus not indicate whether you are looking at files on the mount point or files on the actual disk?) But in copying the files I get a ton of error messages, mostly relating to mknod and symlink, all of which end in "Operation not permitted (1)." According to man rsync, "(1)" indicates a syntax error. But that doesn't make sense if the error is "Operation not permitted." 

I need an rsync guru.

Some source packages that use the kernel headers and do auto config look for
the kernel sources in two places /lib/modules/`uname-r`/source and
/usr/src/linux.
Barring finding the kernel sources there a package will ask you where
your kernel sources
are.
Building a kernel does not require root privileges except to do make
module-install and
make install.
Most packages will build anywhere as any user and only need root to
run install.  The only
problem I see is that if the install script does not do thing
correctly then your files
from the package are tagged as the user that built them.

Even though I think you already solved your sound problem I will share
what I did to solve my firefox sound problem.

I used ALSA's OSS compatibility layer program aoss. I don't know about
other distributions, but in Gentoo it is in media-libs/alsa-oss. Now
start firefox with aoss. In other words, on the command line or in
your shortcuts replace 'firefox' with 'aoss firefox'.

Because mknod and ln command are not supported on the windows box but rsync
doesn't know what the other end can do until it tries it.

Larry,

   But, there is no replacement for /usr/src/linux in the LSB that I could
find with Google, and there's no downside to continuing to build as root in
that directory, is there?

   Yes, sound's working like a charm now. It needed to have the flash plug-in
upgraded to version 9beta.

   I added 'alsa' as another format in .mplayer/config for os. Works well.

I think that was part of the reason it was deprecated: Generally, you
shouldn't build as root; "make install" is all you should need root for
(and not even that if you're building packages, but you aren't).  If for
no other reason than that root tends to have fewer resource limits.
Generally, if it doesn't need root, it shouldn't be done as root.

Agreed.  There is no "good" reason to be building stuff as root anymore.

ubuntu doesn't have a root password by default such that you cannot
login as root.
Everything is done through sudo.

Wil,

   Only on the rare occasion that I build a kernel do I do so as root. But,
I'll move the slackbuild/ directory to another partition where I have full
permissions and build my packages there.

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Occasional windows, and VMware
Message-ID: <20070116234942.GB24379@gate.kl-ic.com>


The thread on network storage was discussing "infrequently used
machines", dual boot, and the like.   I am running a Windows 98
guest image using VMware player, which allows me to run all the
old Windoze apps (like Quickbooks and some CAD stuff) through a
virtual window on my desktop.  No dual boot or other machines needed.

VMware PLAYER is free as in beer, but not free as in freedom :-(. 
QEMU is a F/OSS alternative, but slow.  Sadly, the speedier KQEMU is
proprietary, much like VMware, and I do not know how capable it is.

VMWare player does everything I need it to, including connect to an
in-machine virtual network that NATs out to the host machine's real
network connection.  So I can connect to file shares and printers via
that internal network without completely exposing fragile little
Windoze to the dangerous internet.  I imagine I could still pick up
something through bad windoze files or bad websites, but it will be
blocked from real damage by iptables on the Linux host, and I can
clean up the damage from the host while the windows guest is stopped.

The vfat filesystem for the guest is stored in a .vmdk file, a big
binary blob that behaves like a partition.  The .vmdk file of a
stopped guest can be mounted by the Linux host with a VMware program
called vmware-mount.pl .  The mounter program complains about access
with newer kernels, but I have not seen any problems yet yet yet yet ...

Normally, you need the $$$ VMware Workstation to build the starting
images that VMplayer works with.  Ted Kubaska pointed out the site
www.easyvmx.com, which will produce these images for you, and there
are other websites like that.  It works much better if the guest has
a copy of VMware Tools, but those can be copied from one of the beta
versions or demo disks.

Remaining problems with the VMware approach include the inability
to drive specialized windoze-only internal hardware, though it does
just fine with exernal peripherals.  It will talk with parallel port
and USB license dongles, for example.  Unlike the Win4Lin that I
previously used, VMware does not require any kernel mods, and
allows full screen access, three button mouse control, and sound.  
It probably sucks with games.

VMplayer does load a tainted module or two.  Of course, you need a copy
of Windoze to install on it.  A .vmdk can be copied, and multiple
copies can be run on the same machine or over the network, though that
would violate the Microsoft EULA and we would never ever ever be that
mean to poor old Bill Gates.  VMware is not free as in freedom, but
free-er and more flexible than Windows on bare metal, and more capable
than the greatly appreciated but not-quite-ready-for-prime-time Wine.

So check it out.  Perhaps if there is time at the clinic this Sunday,
we can have a mini-VMplayer workshop, bring your (gag-choke-gasp)
Windoze install disks and the license certificate.  I feel dirty 
enough helping people with legitimate Windoze, I will not help with
unlicensed Windoze, and if you want unlicensed software (good for
you) we have Linux.

Also, the first meeting of the Portland VMWare user's group is
Wednesday afternoon, at 4pm:

(from their announcement)
  Standard Insurance Center
  Auditorium, C-Level
  900 SW 5th Ave   
  Portland, OR 97204

  Note: Standard Insurance occupies three buildings in close proximity
  downtown. The one we'll be holding the meeting in is on the block
  bounded by 4th and 5th, Taylor and Salmon. To reach the auditorium
  you'll need to take the escalators down to the C-Level. We should have
  signs up to help direct traffic.

FWIW, Red Hat / Fedora is doing it completely differently. Kernel
sources now come from source code packages, and are installed in some
long directory - e.g., my RHEL 5 b2 kernel source is in:

/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/kernel-2.6.18/linux-2.6.18.i386/

To simplify the process of building drivers, there's also a kernel-devel
package that doesn't include all kernel source - that's installed in:

/usr/src/kernels/2.6.18-1.2747.el5-i686/

To make this work with generic stuff that need /usr/src/linux, I've had
to create it as a soft link to the actual source code directory.

Don't know if Red Hat's actions mean that /usr/src/linux is being
deprecated though.

Thanks,
Mike

Jason,

You might reconsider the idea I proposed.  

I have a print server that is dual boot win98/win2k (both FAT32).
I have periodically have problems with win2k not booting that required
deletion or replacement of a file. 
Booting to win98 to solve the issue has saved my ass more than once.

I'd consider that if I had not finally figured out how to mount the USB
drive. Now that I have I can read/write to it from the command line, even if
it is hanging on a Windows 2000 computer. So there is no need to install
Linux on the Windows 2000 desktop computer.

Right now all I need to do (I think) is figure out how to fix my rsync
command. At this time it is:

sudo rsync -av --delete --exclude=/proc --exclude=/media / /media/smb/laptop

It copies the files to the /laptop folder on the USB drive -- Windows 2000
sees them there, so I know they are really there, not just copied to the
mount point. (Why does Nautilus not indicate whether you are looking at
files on the mount point or files on the actual disk?) But in copying the
files I get a ton of error messages, mostly relating to mknod and symlink,
all of which end in "Operation not permitted (1)." According to man rsync,
"(1)" indicates a syntax error. But that doesn't make sense if the error is
"Operation not permitted." 

I need an rsync guru.

Keith,

   I'd like to go to this meeting. Tomorrow afternoon, eh?

   I've been using VMware since the pre-1.0 betas, and I need to upgrade to
WS-5.5.3 from the current -5.5.1 because the latter will not run on a 2.6.19
kernel. For two days now I've tried downloading the tarball, but the server
stops responding after about 70M (of 106M) has come down. Started with
win95, then (gag!) had to buy a full version of win98se to upgrade; an
additional $100 for a bootable floppy disk.

   If I can painlessly migrate the existing installation to the 'player'
version, I'd really like to do that. The upgrade fees (not for minor
versions) are high for the occasional use I make of it.

Mike,

   That was how RH 4.0 did it, and that's why I have I have those directories
still on my systems.

   Slackware provides packages, too, but I prefer to add capabilities I need
(and not have those I don't need), so I build a custom kernel.

FWIW, Red Hat / Fedora is doing it completely differently. Kernel
sources now come from source code packages, and are installed in some
long directory - e.g., my RHEL 5 b2 kernel source is in:

/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/kernel-2.6.18/linux-2.6.18.i386/

I used VMWare (purchased by my employer) four or so years back.  At
that time it could run Windoze off of a normal MS-installed windoze
(vfat) partition.  This meant that you could set up a dual-boot
system, and choose to run the same Windoze either inside VMWare or
natively.  Changes made in one mode stuck around in the other, and you
didn't waste disk space with two copies.

Can VMWare Player do that?

Thanks,

Ah. And I have since discovered errors with chown, no doubt the same
issue.

So that means that I can rsync the files to the USB disk hanging on the
Windows 2000 desktop, but it will never be a real mirror of my Ubuntu
laptop because links, ownerships and such cannot be transferred with
the files. 

So to get a real mirror the filesystem on the USB drive would have to
be ext3 or something Linuxy, right? Of course, Windows wouldn't see it.
So maybe I'd better revisit Bill's suggestion above. Except I'd really
rather not mess with the Windows desktop. 

I'd rather just shut down the Windows desktop except when I need it --
a couple times a month. And for backup, maybe I should just build a new
bare-bones Linux desktop that I can leave turned off also, except when
I want to back up the laptop. Or go back to the original idea of
getting a network drive, then sell off the USB drive.

Oh, and I decided to go ahead and rsync the laptop from / to the USB
disk on the Windows desktop, in spite of not having permissions and
ownerships. The laptop has about 30 GB on it. Rsync got
to /lib/libc-2.3.6.so and locked up the laptop with the CPU racing at
high speed. I'm guessing it copied about half the 30 GB. There's no
easy way to tell what caused this. There's enough flaky hardware on
this Compaq laptop that it could easily be a hardware issue. Or a bug
in Dapper amd-64 somewhere. <sigh>

The idea is that GCC and Make are large programs, that haven't been
designed with security in mind. Their whole point after all is to take
bytecode (source) and cause it to be directly executed...  Even after
that there can be weaknesses in the build scripts that just make it
worse.

/usr/src isn't being deprecated, but it is standard procedure to build as
another user. Generally you use the environment variable "O" to tell the
kernel where to place object files (outside of /usr/src), and "DESTDIR"
to have Make place the resultant kernel somewhere else (which you then
merely copy as root). Finally, there is the `fakeroot` utility which
allows you to build packages (pretty much tarballs/cpio files) that
appear to tar/cpio to be owned by root so they work correctly when
installed.

It is an interesting proposition, but simply it is a desire to do the
minimal amount as root.

Good question!

I tried that first;  while it ran off the vfat partition (configured
appropriately in the text .vmdk and .vmx), it was slow.  The partition
was made with Linux vfat, and the files preloaded through Linux, and
I fooled with them while Windoze was shut down, so I may have bent
something.  I went with a .vmdk because that Just Worked.  So I had
some trouble, possibly self-caused;  you may have better luck,
especially if you do the format and install into the partition directly
through the Windoze installer.  Try it and let us know how it works.


What I would REALLY like is what the older versions of Win4Lin did;
the files were stored on the disk as ordinary Linux files, and the
Win4Lin did some fancy translation to present the files as FAT32 to
Windoze.  That was more robust and faster than native Windoze file
systems, so Win98/Win4Lin was faster than Win98/baremetal (!).
I never had problems with files disappearing, even if I added a
file from the Linux end while Win4Lin was running;  close and reopen
a Win98 directory, and there was the file.  Great for moving stuff
back and forth to the running image.

Unfortunately, Win4Lin required a special recompiled kernel to do this
(not surprising), and they abandoned the approach when NTFS came along,
using something much like VMware VMDK binary files.  Win4Lin lost their
one advantage, and retained all their many disadvantages, so VMware is
the best way now.  But if there was some way to emulate that old-style
Win4Lin "linux underneath" file storage with 2.6 kernel modules, so that
I could organize a directory of files into something that the emulator
presented as a file system to a VMware guest, I would be very happy.

There is also now the free as in beer VMware Server, which, while not as 
good a development tool as VMware Workstation, *will* run on either a 
Linux or Windows host and build virtual machines for the player to play. 
I've never actually used the player -- I have a Windows host Workstation 
license and a VMTN subscription. I've beta tested Workstation 6 on a 
Linux host, and I'll probably not upgrade my Workstation 5.5 license or 
renew the VMTN subscription -- VMware Server does what little I need. If 
I buy anything at all it will be a Workstation 6 for a Linux host.

(Why does Nautilus not indicate whether you are looking at files on the mount point or files on the actual disk?) But in copying the files I get a ton of error messages, mostly relating to mknod and symlink, all of which end in "Operation not permitted (1)." According to man rsync, "(1)" indicates a syntax error. But that doesn't make sense if the error is "Operation not permitted."

a linksys nslu2 will allow you to plug your usb drive into it and if
you switch it
to linux you could make it a rsync server.

BTW rsync does a better job doing a pull instead of a push.

Here is a rsyncd.conf file that I use to backup a full system.
#/etc/rsyncd.conf
uid=root
gid=wheel
use chroot=no
syslog facility=local5
pid file=/var/run/rsyncd.pid

## Put distributions here
##
## FORMAT:
##
## [DISTNAME]
##   path=/path/to/files
##   comment=some comment
##
## [DIST2]
##   path=/path/to/files2
##   comment=another comment
[LINUX_BASE]
        comment="Base Linux Fedora 4 Development System"
        path=/
        exclude=proc/* mnt/* pebbles/* tmp/* sys/* dev/* var/run/* var/spool/*
        read only=yes


Note there seems to be a problem with with excludes that causes failures.
path=/
exclude=/proc /sys/*
The above causes errors on rsync pull but
path=/
exclude=proc/*
works correctly.
This error occurs with the default install and the latest from the samba site.

Two suggestions come to mind.

1) Boot the Windows desktop with a knoppix CD, format the USB drive with
ext3 or
reiserfs or your favorite linux filesystem and rsync via Knoppix.

2) Format the USB drive with ext2 and use the Windows ext2
driver http://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2fsd
discussed in this months Linux Journal. That might fix your rsync errors
but  I
have never used such a beast so I can't say for sure.

Here's a good book on the topic I just discovered that is free... 
http://www.kroah.com/lkn/

Chapter one says... "The kernel source code should also never be placed 
in the /usr/src/linux/ directory, as that is the location of the kernel 
that the system libraries were built against, not your new custom kernel."

I suppose it varies based on the distro (as others have pointed out).

Thanks for that advice. It's nice to know that an nslu2 will work well.
But I just discovered that my USB drive is 150 GB, not 250 GB as I
thought. Also, it occurs to me that I'd like to use whatever drive I
have to back up the Windows desktop as well, not that there will be
much backing up to do, as little as I use it nowadays.

I think I'd rather go back to my original idea of getting a straight
network drive, say 400 GB. I could use it for both the Windows desktop
and the Linux laptop, using rsync. I'd create one partition with ext3
and another with NTFS. I'm not sure how to do that, but if I want
permissions and ownerships to be saved from Linux it can't be FAT32;
and if I want Windows to see it it has to be either FAT32 or NTFS. So
the only solution is to use two different partitions, one for each
platform.

> Here is a rsyncd.conf file that I use to backup a full system.

<config file saved>

I read about config files, but I have some questions:

The uid means the user id, but which user? I am jcj on the Windows
desktop and jjj on the Linux laptop. Similarly, the gid means group id,
but my group on Windows is workgroup and on Linux the group is jjj
(jjj:jjj). Which of these do I use?

Also, I note you are excluding /sys and /tmp, which I did not do. (I
just excluded /proc and /media.) Is it a good idea to exclude these
additional folders? And I just did --exclude=/proc, where you have
exclude=proc/* (and so on). Should I have the /* after the folder in
the exclude statement? I never know whether to add the / or not.

Hello -

Quoting the "father of linux", Linus Torvalds - here is his words on
this very subject posted July 27, 2000 ;

I would suggest that people who compile new kernels should:

   - NOT do so in /usr/src. Leave whatever kernel (probably only the
   header files) that the distribution came with there, but don't touch it.
   - compile the kernel in their own home directory, as their very own
   selves. No need to be root to compile the kernel. You need to be root to
   *install* the kernel, but that's different.
   - not have a single symbolic link in sight (except the one that the
   kernel build itself sets up, namely the "linux/include/asm" symlink that is
   only used for the internal kernel compile itself).

And yes, this is what I do. My /usr/src/linux still has the old
2.2.13header files, even though I haven't run a
2.2.13 kernel in a *loong* time. But those headers were what glibc was
compiled against, so those headers are what matches the library object
files.

And this is actually what has been the suggested environment for at least
the last five years. I don't know why the symlink business keeps on living
on, like a bad zombie. Pretty much every distribution still has that broken
symlink, and people still remember that the linux sources should go into
"/usr/src/linux", even though that hasn't been true in a *loong* time.

Is there some documentation file that I've not updated, and that people are
slavishly following outdated information in? I don't read the documentation
myself, so I'd never notice ;)

Rob beat me to it! Yea basically Linus says you shouldn't do it ... although
I still do it out of habit.  I did actually build outside /usr/src at one
point in time and its fine to do that although you should create a directory
explicitly for builds because when you go to compile something looking for
/usr/src/linux ect ect you're going to have to point to whatever source you
used to build your kernel.

I haven't read anything from Pat saying you have to do slackbuilds outside
/usr/src fwiw.

All the systems I come into contact with can be categorized as either
low-security dev boxes or high-security servers.  If I were really
worried about the implications of building a kernel as root on a
server, that track of thought leads eventually to the utter removal of
the compiler from the server.  On such systems, perhaps the kernel
should be built on a different, safer machine.

If you update your kernel, wouldn't you also want to recompile glib
against the new kernel?  I'm not a C programmer, or I'd know these
things.  I'd suppose any C library that calls kernel functions would
benefit from a recompile.  I don't think gentoo's revdep-rebuild finds
victims of a kernel recompile, though I could be wrong again.

The uid/gid is that of the running daemon for security in server mode
only not file
permissions.

My testing shows that it is safer to use proc or proc/* not /proc on
the exclude of the
server config.  I don't know if rsync parses the command lines the
same as the config
but I would assume so.  proc/* allows a full backup to get directory
but not its contents
so a restore should work from a livecd without any additional work.

/tmp should not be backed up as it should only be used by the programs
currently
running on the machine.
/sys is the kernel's sys filesystem.  It is only valid on the existing
running kernel just
like /proc.  Trying to restore /sys on to a running kernel would give
nothing but errors.

Note: a savior of Qemu is KVM. I read a great little article in Linux Journal that showed that qemu running on KVM is as good and in some cases better than the KQemu. Keep in mind you need a VT Chip.

I have used the VMWare instance of FC6 on Workstation, server and runtime. 
(I usually configure on server and then use it on runtime, since I get 
much better performance.)

I have used VMWare Server under FC6.  It has worked fine for me.  Building 
kernel modules requires a pretty trivial hack.  (You have to have kernel 
headers installed for your running kernel.  In "include/linux" you need to 
symlink "autoconf.h" to "config.h".)

VMWare tools requires some additional hackery, but is doable.

It's generally not a good practice to do builds on a production server,
if for no other reason than the performance impact and the fact the
builds are most reproducible on fairly clean systems and production
servers tend to accumulate cruft in the face of their duties.

Not usually.  You generally only need to rebuild glibc if the syscall
interface changes and that's quite rare.  The user/kernel interface is a
well-established protocol that uses a software interrupt (80h) and is in
fact pretty much the same protocol across operating systems.  Look down
to "Doing more interesting things" in this:

I will be there, valid Windows disks in hand. I hope someone can show
it to me first before I install it, though. Does it need to be
downloaded, that is should I download a file first using my fast cable

That's just where the src.rpm installs by default if you install it as
root.  Which you shouldn't, because you shouldn't build as root.  (The
only exception is things like the VMware configuration, which requires
it, but that's because it's driven by a vendor-provided script that
values customer-ease-of-use over security.)

A lot of work has gone into packaging in the last few years to ensure
that packages build as non-root.  See my page here for setting up a
non-root RPM build environment:

Since 2.4 (and possibly earlier) the convention for out-of-mainline
drivers is to look for the the necessary headers in 
"/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build", which is usually symlink to wherever
the distro decided to put them.  There are, however, still some broken
build systems that require /usr/src/linux.  (I don't recall now what,
but I recall seeing it in the past couple of years.)

I've run into suggestions that horde should NOT be in the Document root of
the apache server installation.

I want to give Horde it's own document root, but I don't want it to
use a different ip address.

I remember for the 2.8 version of the Horde framework that there was
a way to limit the ip networks that can access it in a config file.
I haven't seen anything like this for horde-3.0.3.

I've also run into suggestions specifically that Horde has a phplib
implementation inside it and that this should be removed from the
DocumentRoot somehow.

What is the best way to secure Horde?

About the 0 above, this is snipped out of lsmod's output.  Does

Why does openttd, open transport tycoon deluxe, require graphics files from
a commercial Windows program by Microspire?

http://www.openttd.org/

Is it a GPL project that is worthless if you don't have graphics files
that you have to pay for.  More bothersome, whose to say that Microspire
won't attempt to crush the project the way Blizzard destroyed the
Freecraft project?

OpenTTD is used to advertise ReactOS.  Apparently, it works on: Linux,  
Mac OS-X,
Windows, and Dos.  Can you even buy Transport Tycoon Deluxe anymore?

Is this the wave of the future, the ability to play old popular games under
Linux and possibly on ReactOS as well if you bought a copy in the past for
Windows that still works?  Why doesn't someone just replace the proprietary
graphics files?  Noone wants to mess around with GPL software if they still
have to pay full price for the proprietary equivalent do they?

And this is especially true if you are developing new RPMs.  I have 
encountered make files that try all sorts of nasty tricks upon build. 
(Like trying to install themselves to odd locations, delete "working" 
files, etc.)

                                   |Linux WAP
                                   |LAN hosts
                                   |
                                   |

The WAP used a simple Ethernet bridge between the wireless and wired 
interface, ath0 + eth0 = br0. Everything worked fine and life was good. Both 
wired and wireless clients could see each other, and had Internet.

So one fine day I says to myself, two boxes is too many, so I removed the WAP. 
I stuck the wireless card in the router and bridged it to eth0, just like 
when it was a separate WAP. Identical config. So the router now looks like 
this:

eth1                      22.33.44.55  WAN interface
br0 (ath0 + eth0)   192.168.1.25

All the LAN hosts have Internet and can ping the router. The wired hosts can 
ping each other. But the wireless hosts cannot ping their wired brethren, nor 
the reverse. They're all on the same subnet, 192.168.1.0/24. When I turn off 
iptables everything works.

The only changes I made were in /etc/network/interfaces and iptables. In my 
iptables script all I did was replace "eth0" with "br0":

#!/bin/sh

The non-beta version was supposedly released today.  I have not  been in a

I think you answer your own question.  Just turn off all that iptables
crap.  If you really need it, add it back gradually until it stops
working and then figure out what's wrong with the part that breaks it.

Pardon, Master, for this lowly grasshopper questioning your wisdom, but what 
is this? Google returns nothing, nor does searching my various iptables 
howtos. Lotsa hits for git-bisect, though!

And yes, running the rules one at a time is the smart thing to do, and I am 
doing it. I have a faint nagging memory about needing a rule for the 
broadcast addy to make this work, so we shall see.

I understood this as an allusion to the bisection algorithm. Which if
applied  in this case you would divide
the set of  iptables rules in half and test each half separately. Then when
you decide in which half the problem exists, you divide that group in half
and so on, until you narrow it down to the rule that is giving the trouble.
Thus finding the troubling rule much quicker than testing them one at a
time.
This assumes of course that the iptables rules are independent of each
other, which they mostly
are, or otherwise you just group the dependent ones together and treat them
as one rule.

Umm, I have no idea what you said.

But there is a more important question. Last time the rsync backup
locked up the computer about halfway through. (I suspect I have a
hardware problem with the hard disk in the laptop -- the disk is good,
the connection is flaky.) So just now I decided I'd do it over. Of
course, it should not need to copy again all the files it did the first
time. I amended my rsync command by excluding /sys and /tmp. This is
what I ran:

sudo rsync -av --delete --exclude=/proc --exclude=/media --exclude=/sys --exclude=/tmp / /media/smb/laptop

I had to stop it immediately, as I noticed it was deleting files from
the laptop's hard drive:

jjj at Devil5:~$ sudo rsync -av --delete --exclude=/proc --exclude=/media
--exclude=/sys --exclude=/tmp / /media/smb/laptop building file list ... done 
deleting dev/.udev/db/class at usb_device@usbdev1.2
deleting dev/.udev/db/class at input@input4 at ts2
deleting dev/.udev/db/class at input@input4 at mouse2
etc.

And a quick check with Nautilus reveals that these files are, indeed,
no longer on the laptop's hard drive. Nor are they on the backup media
(the USB drive hanging on the Windows 2000 desktop). 

I don't know what is going on here. In the rsync command line the
source comes first and the destination second, right?

Ah, grasshopper, I believe you are ready for "dirvish", www.dirvish.com,
hosted by yours semi-truly.  Not the easiest tool, needs a lot of 
newbie proofing, but easier to use than raw rsync.

If we weren't already planning to fool with vmware at the clinic,
dirvish would be an interesting diversion.  If we had more help at
the clinics, it would be productive to do free-for-all in one room
and specific topic in the other, with monthly topics like wireless
or dirvish or vmware or iptables for specifics.

Alas that leaves you open while you debug it. There is a much simpler way
though. Every iptables rule has a byte counter. To see it, use the "-v"
option to iptables when using "-L". -Z will zero the counters. If you
understand your traffic, you can simply use the counters on the existing
rules to figure out where packets are disappearing. If that doesn't work,
then insert extra rules with no jump target that match the packets you're
interested in. Once you find a rule whose counter is lagging behind the
others, that is where the problem is.

This of course assumes the guess of it being filtered out somewhere is
correct.

Silly Pluggers, just unplug the WAN cable, since this particular problem is on 
the LAN. Lo-tech has its uses :)

Subject: [PLUG] VMware users group meeting
Message-ID: <20070118045326.GA8782@gate.kl-ic.com>


I went to the VMware user's group meeting this afternoon (Weds 17th),
John Jordan went as well, hoping to learn something about VMware of
the simple player variety.  No chance;  John was pretty patient
though, I guess this develops from boring classes at PSU.

There were about 30 people there, 3 vendor people, 2 reps from VMware
and a fellow from Visioncore talking about their product esxRanger.
Of the 27 civilians there, there was about 10 running the $$$ ESX
server product, 14 running the no-cost crippleware VMware Server
product, one person running Workstation, John, and myself.

esxRanger is a backup product for ESX Server VMware running Windows 
guests on Windows hosts.  Gag me with a EULA.  It was interesting to
see this major backup product and compare it with dirvish and rsync;
there are some useful features, but for the most part it is GUI
"lipstick on a pig".  Essentially, the backups are baselines plus
incrementals;  they are "fast" because they run from a VMWare ESX
Server disk set to a backup disk set on the same SAN network, but
rsync over a network would beat the pants off this for widely
distributed virtual machines.  

So, unless you are managing large VMware server deployments, this
user group is probably not very interesting.  We should form our
own little SIG for VMware (and other virtualizers) running on
Linux hosts, instead.

OK, installation was easy because dirvish was listed in Synaptic
(version 1.2-1). 

However, configuring it will require many hours of study. I hate hours
of study. I read through the documentation:
(http://edseek.com/~jasonb/articles/dirvish_backup/configuration.html)
but I didn't understand half of it.

A clinic session with this would be good, except that to configure the
location for the backup I kind of need to be connected to my home
ethernet. Maybe I could fake that.

It's too late to try to figure out dirvish. This grasshopper needs to
hide under a warm leaf until morning.

Yeah, but rereading my flip remark, I saw the ambiguity.  I apologize
for that.  iptables-bisect is something that doesn't exist, but to a
zeroth-order approximation, ought to exist...  would be cool if it
existed... or maybe wouldn't work at all.  It's one of those.

When hacking on OpenWrt images, removing the firewall init script
(with its hairy iptables clauses) is one of the first things I do to
get things working.

Or how about a group geared towards technology instead of a specific
product?

I run two vmware-server hosts, one vmware workstation, and plan to add
another vmware-server.  The third one will be a production environment,
and chosen mainly due to existing VMware experience.

But.. I plan on looking at Xen (FOSS and XenEnterprise), and OpenVZ.
Solaris even has some interesting VM technology (Niagra/T1 is just too
awesome to ignore as a VM host platform).  Even KVM will be coming soon
to a distribution near you.

So.. how about a virtualization group?

Keith,

   Considering road conditions were still bad out here, and I have three
irritating glitches to fix after the distribution upgrades, I decided to not
go. Looks like a wise decision.

   I like this idea. I have two legacy apps and one occasional app that
require the virtual win98. If there's an option (server or player) that's
less expensive than the workstation licenses, I'm all for it.

   BTW, was the pig's lipstick full of glitter?

To add a Xen twist to this, there are certain types of Intel (and AMD, I 
think) chips that can run Windows guests under Xen. The VMware marketing 
guys flag this as "Did you know you need special hardware to run Windows 
with Xen?" :) But just how special *are* these chips? If I walked into 
Fry's or CompUsa or Office Depot and just bought "a PC" that was 
manufactured recently, would the chips in it have the ability to run a 
Windows guest under Xen?

A few days ( weeks ??? ) ago I discovered a (F)OSS project based on 
tesseract.  I think it was reported by LWN.

So this AM I tried to compile it as a normal user on a Fedora Core 6 
system.  No joy!  I'm going to try again at work on a couple of 
different systems to make sure it isn't something I, as a regular user, 
tweaked in my setup and is causing problems.

    Until I can get some results from work I was wondering if anyone on 
the list has tried/succeeded compiling tesseract?

FWIW, Xen is still a bloody mess on RHEL 5 beta 2. The news reports
suggest that it's the primary reason for RHEL 5 delays (a previous
schedule suggested a release at the end of 2006). The workarounds
required to make things like Windows installs work on Xen require too
much post install customization. It's much cleaner (a.k.a. brain dead
easy) on SLES 10.

Thanks,
Mike

Personally, I'd prefer KVM over Xen considering the recent work that has been done and 
the outlook, which is significantly more positive than Xen's.

About the CPU's: you'll need the 'vmx' extension listed in /proc/cpuinfo. In practice, 
all core 2 duo's and pentium 4's have it, so it's not that special, but many celeron's 
come without it.

http://kvm.sf.net/ knows more.

I keep my iptables scripts as simple as possible, so doing a manual 
flush-all-rules, then run-one-at-a-time-in-order is no big deal. One way to 
bisect is eliminate all service rules, and first test the basic accept/drop 
rules.

I think some folks go a little nuts when it comes to writing iptables rules 
and go on these wild sprees and write a gazillion rules just because they 
can. I don't want to maul those poor little packets unnecessarily, and I sure 
don't want to make a simple firewall script my life's work.

Same here, with any prefab firewall thingy. It seems like all the specialized 
firewall/WAP Linuxes, and all the firewall tools that are supposed to make 
iptables easier just make bigger messes. Have you ever looked at IPCop's 
iptables rules? Big spaghetti tangle of Bash scripting and gobs of rules for 
gosh knows what. More complexity doesn't mean more security, not when it's 
such a tangle you don't understand what it's doing.

And now [drum roll] the solution:

$ipt -A INPUT -i br0 -j ACCEPT
$ipt -A FORWARD -i br0 -j ACCEPT

It's usually a good practice to define your sources and destinations, so I'll 
be dinking around with adding those. But this definitely works.

The other thing that definitely works is don't combine iptables and 
bridging :)

I seldom need to OCR things, but I have been frustrated by the fact
that there seems to be little in the way of OCR software for Linux. One
day I discovered:

http://www.simpleocr.com/Demo/

And ever since have used it for those few occasions when I need to OCR
something.

Strike that bit about Pentium 4's. Most, but not all, Pentium D's are 
VT-enabled, but the P4 has been on the market a long time, and most of 
them in production are pre-VT.

I've never had the need to run a non-Linux OS in Xen, but I've been 
giving Linux/Xen a fairly serious workout at work. One tremendously 
cool use is to host web apps behind our border firewall on Xen VMs and 
use mod_proxy to make them visible to the public Internet. Then I can 
give folks admin rights on their VM and let them run amok. They're

Subject: [PLUG] Free stuff
Message-ID: <20070118103758.3638da20.johnxj@comcast.net>

I have the following stuff to give away:

(1) EZ Flyer 230 MB, external drive. Has manual, wall wart and two
disks. Even has an external SCSI cable. The connectors on the drive are
25 pin, but I must have been using it with a SCSI card that had one of
those big 50-pin external connectors (looks like teeth), because the
cable is 50-pin on one end and 25-pin on the other. These drives were
once very popular with DTPers to transfer files to service bureaus for
prepress output on imagesetters, because the Macs that service bureaus
all used back then could read the PC formatted media.

(2) Syjet 1.5 GB internal SCSI drive, 3.5 inch form factor. Has manual,
Windows installation floppies and five disks, one of which is brand
new, still in the wrapper. The connector is standard 50-pin SCSI for
internal cable. I used this drive as temporary backup media. It is
currently set to SCSI ID 2, no parity, and not terminated. The manual
explains how to change the jumpers for different ID, parity, and
termination. As I recall, it was temperamental (all Syquest drives
require incantations to get the media to mount).

(3) US Robotics external modem, Courier V.Everything with manuals and
wall wart. It's only 33.6/28.8 K, so probably not of much use to
anyone. 

Free to pluggers, else I?ll give them to Free Geek when I go to the
Clinic this Sunday.

Also, since Auke didn't mention them, the Core Duos (not Core 2 Duos)
also come with VT.  So basically any Intel-based Mac except the Core
Solo Mac Mini can run hardware virtualization.

There is a claim that the GPL is being violated by Linksys at the
following URL:

      http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/7/164

I've been lookign into replacing a PII running Slackware 10.1 as a wireless
router with something smaller and more robust, the Linksys WRT54G.  The
wireless I currently use is 802.11b based, so I worry that the WRT54G is
not compatible.

It appears I can grab at least one of these for less than $50 shipped
now.  I'm thinking this might be an easier way to get encryption
working than trying to figure that out in Slackware.

Look at the date.  Linksys has been purchased by Cisco and is making the GPL
sources available for the system but the newer models (>=Rev 5) use
VXworks and do not have GPL violations.  Both ways work with Linux just fine.
the WRT54GL does use Linux and has enough memory for you to replace it with
your own from openwrt or DD-WRT without any real issues.

I've done NAT on a Cisco (which *was* Internet security for SOHO back in
the day), self-rolled iptables, pf, and some of the firewall kits for linux.

I gave up writing my own iptables scripts.  I agree that you could make
an unprofitable career out of maintaining it. :)

I will defend the complexity a bit by saying that there are some very
interesting network hacks that require tricks in order to counter.  PF
has some interesting features that clean packets to and from a firewall.

I've standardized on Shorewall both for host and network iptables
management.  Every time I needed to debug I've always been able to
navigate Shorewall's output from `iptables -L -vn`.  OpenVPN
configuration and termination is easily managed as well.  I have yet to
play with Shorewall+IPsec.  Things got a little muddy in the switch from
2.4 to 2.6 with the move from dedicated interfaces to security contexts
maintained by the kernel.

very very old news.

following 3 links from the article gets you here quickly:

http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Download_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115417110138&packedargs=sku%3D1121874579357&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper

yes, that's the GPL source download page for this router type (v1).

linksys was one of the companies that complied relatively easy, as it didn't take 
gpl-violations.org measures to get them to comply :)

Auke

kvm.sf.net says:

So for those of us running "stable" (older) kernels, we find out by
running a newer Live CD.  At this time, that would be Ubuntu Edgy
(2.6.17) or Fedora 6 (2.6.18) or Knoppix 5.11 (2.6.19) .  I will
download one of them and try it.

I've successfully enabled and run VT on a T7200 Core 2 Duo. As I
understand it, most Core 2 Duos (T5600 and above) run VT fine. 

The AMD Pacifica chips, TL-50(?) and above also run VT.

Thanks,

What's the Windows equivalent? I can't walk up to a Windows machine in a

the anser is right there, use a linux-based livecd. I'm sure your machine will survive

I've not been closely following your sound saga but I've seen reference

you use) here:

I have a server that appears to have been compromised.

I found three executable files where none should be:

-r-xr-xr-x  1 root root 111748 2007-01-16 17:12 /dev/pt
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 102512 2007-01-16 17:12 /dev/nt
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 20404 2007-01-16 17:12 /dev/tr

I also found three files in /bin that were associated with a non-existent user.

Well ... the ability to boot a LiveCD on a machine in a store rather 
limits you to stores where the sales people aren't on commission. :) But 
seriously, it would be easier to read the ads, check the chips out on 
the Internet and buy something you know will work. Or go someplace where 
they build them to order like Fry's or CompUSA.

I don't know about cardbus/pcmcia sound cards, but there are quite a few 
decent USB sound cards. Still, it seems strange you wouldn't be able to 
get the built in sound working.

The pdxlinux.org home page still says January 21 for the AT talk.

Sorry to bother everyone with this, but I'm not certain who can edit the

You may have to google for the particular set of exploits.  I've
never seen those.  Much of what happened depends on the security
hole they came in through.   Is there a recent backup image of
the machine, allowing you to do a file-by-file comparison?

Lots of questions need answering, like what distro, how recently
upgraded, how many legitimate users, etc., but those would be best
answered offline.

Operators are standing by.  Where is the machine?  The easiest way
to do this is to replace the hard drive with a rebuild;  perhaps we
can help with that, both with physical access and with building the
next one a little less vulnerable.  Forensics on the old hard drive
would be very valuable - don't erase it! - save it as is, corrupted,
and later it can be mounted non-executable read-only on another machine
for analysis.

The newer setup should have file integrity monitoring.  Of course,
I need to set that up for my outside server, I have been lax myself.
Another project.

And the bad guy may be a few machines behind that.

You have high visibility, and the system cracker may have gone after
you to show off.  The twit may be reading the plug list.  If so,
perhaps he will do something more productive with his useless life,
like get simultaneous AIDs, leprosy, and bone cancer, and die in
some rat-infested alley.

You have been rooted.  Those applications (and a few more, I would guess) 
have been replaced with rigged versions.  (Usually to hide the real apps.)

chkrootkit is your friend in this case.

Sound like the IRC twits that rooted my machine about five years back.

You will need to reinstall.  Most rootkits install all sorts of backdoors. 
Finding them all is a royal pain.

What version of Linux are you running?

If you need help with it, contact me off-line.

You will need to reinstall.  Most rootkits install all sorts of backdoors. 
Finding them all is a royal pain.

What version of Linux are you running?

If you need help with it, contact me off-line.

I thought it was Geoff Burling.  Not certain who added it in the first 
place.  (Especially since *my* announcement had the right date.)

Cool site.

Also, just as a side note...

The video chipset in that laptop (the NeoMagic 256av) only does hardware
acceleration in 16-bit color.

Yeah, you got hacked. What distro and version are you using? What services
were you running before the hack? They could have used a known exploit that
had yet to be patched. They could have used a brute force attack to gain
access. You will want to get your data off that box asap, and reinstall. It
is not likely that you will be able to locate the attacker. The IP address
in Romania is probably another box they rooted, an internet cafe, public
library, college computer lab or something like that. It's not likely that
it's the IP address that their ISP assigned them. Unless you have
potentially lost significant intelectual property, it's not going to worth
persueing. It would be worth finding the exploit they used though, if it's
not too much work, and most people here would probably be interested to
know.

In the future, keep up with updates to the services you are running. Use
good passwords. These two things alone will likely prevent most attacks from
succeeding. Perhaps install an IDS and something like Tripwire routinely
check the integrity of your binaries.

Thanks to everyone who has responded to this thread.
I was hoping someone realized this right off, but I seem to be out of luck.

I forgot about chkrootkit.  I have used it before in this situation
and it is a friend indeed.  Otherwise, I have been doing most of the
things you guys have recommended as best I can.  Unfortunately, I'm
unable to use some of my normal procedures because this situation is a
bit different from previous invasions.  However, I have a plan that
should work.

I'm a little more perturbed than normal, because this machine was
relatively tight.  And of course, like Keith I intended to install
file integrity monitoring software on this machine, but didn't get
around to it.

OK, I hate to say this guys, but you're peaked quite a lot on interest
from many people. (And many probably won't respond to this thread.) Why
not *if possible* disconnect the machine, and bring it in to a PLUG
meeting. Then do a talk on what to do *after* you suspect your machine
has been hacked. I know that David, Alan, Robert, and many others know
how to troubleshoot this. Quite often, as Robert pointed out, it's not
worth pursueing the culprit, but how do you go through and protect
yourself from this in the future?

Sounds like a good talk... if I had an airline ticket, I would come down
myself and listen to it....

Thanks for the advice.

I probably don't want to reveal much more than I have on a public
mailing list.  At this stage, I have a plan to repair the system.
Just need to do it.  I also have an idea of how the compromise
happened and I need to find a way to block that without blocking my
users.

FWIW, we recently had a PTP box exploited, apparently using a
vulnerability in Cacti.  At least it got hammered DoS'd into
inoperability.  There are some indications that they were never able
to complete their exploit, because the script they wanted to download
at first couldn't get through the captive portal and/or because the
directory they were trying to copy the script to didn't have
compatible write permissions.

However, we rebooted the machine before we really figured out for sure
what they had managed to do.  Because of the uncertainty, we
reinstalled from scratch, which had the downside (or perverse benefit,

NANOG has had a recent discussion about the dangers of CACTI, 
referencing this secunia vulnerability:

http://secunia.com/advisories/23528/

issue #1 is the worst, the full exploit usually requires a local root 
compromise to be truly fruitful (escalation from apache->root)

That's the one.  The logs indicate that the exploit was trying to
download a file called ping.txt.  However, our captive portal (on a
different box) was redirecting them to an auth page instead, which
partially thwarted them.  Also, cacti was running as a user that
didn't have write access to the directory where ping.txt would land.
We do have a 1.7 gigabyte /var/log/apache/error.log file to show for
it though.

After having a couple of machines compromised (which I'm not proud to admit)
I did quite a bit of research and found that LCAP is very nice.

http://www.securityfocus.com/tools/882

One of the write ups I followed suggested installing LCAP then running
chkrootkit which has a list of critical binaries it looks at then making
those binaries immutable and then removing the ability to remove the
immutable flag by way of LCAP ... the only way to bypass the security that
creates is physical access and booting into single user (atleast thats the
theory anyway).

So far since I implemented the above as well as several other security
enhancements to my installs I haven't had any trouble :-)

IIRC, it's only the dual-core X2 AMD68 processors.

I'm waiting for one of these, or a Core 2 Duo, to show up in HP's line
of "Slimline" PCs -- of course at a store that'll let me run a live CD
first and take it back if it doesn't run Linux. :-)

If you want to do forensics later, boot with a Knoppix CD and image the
drive to another drive (e.g. external FW/USB2) before doing any other
work on the afflicted drive.

Dave probably needs the machine, working.  However, I would be willing
to purchase a replacement hard drive, so we can mount this one as a
spare and do forensics on it at a meeting as Piet suggests.  Everything
knowable will be on the drive.

Yeah, we will remove the pr0n and personal information first.  We can
mount it as a second drive on a similar machine, and look at the files
with a good security toolkit.  It is terrible that this happened, but
now that it has, there is a lot we can all learn from it.

Mine shows VME (virtual mode extensions), but no vmx or svm.  Does this mean

   Thanks, Brent. I've read so many conflicting reports on sound on this unit
I no longer know what to believe.

   What I _do_ know is that the alsa_driver must be compiled for each kernel,
that I've had it there for the installed Slackware versions, and I've not
been able to get sound working on this unit.

   I'll try again this weekend. The cs4232 module _is_ loaded, but alsaconf
can't find what it needs and there is no /proc/asound. Sigh.

Thanks,

Rich

Auke,

   Ta-da! After reading all about sound with ALSA and the 2.6 kernel and OSS
with the 2.4 kernel, I followed the link for "those broken sound machines."
That gave me the magic incantations for /etc/rc.d/rc.local, and the command
line equivalent.

   Entering everything on the command line, it works! Wow!

Thank you very much,

Rich

   I didn't mention this on the previous posts, but it is a critical point.
The thinkwiki page said to turn off QuickBoot in the BIOS. Well, I didn't
know whether it was on until I checked. It was. Turning it off allows the
BIOS to see the sound chip(s). Strange, but that's the way it is.

Soooo,

The latest I know...

I downloaded the latest version and got the same result with tech 
support on the phone.  I tried the few ideas he had and ended up at a 
dead end with him.  He had installed Edgy onto a machine and installed 
the same version I have and all went well. He is going to recommend they 
issue me a refund.

I then dropped the CD into my 933 dually and voila! the installer popped 
up ready to rock and roll, hmmmm.

I think I have a malfunction in the Edgy (Kubuntu) install.

Any ideas on fixing the current install before I do something crazy like 
trying Feisty?

Subject: [PLUG] Mount annoyances
Message-ID: <20070119190637.dcc90ea6.johnxj@comcast.net>

I am forever forgetting to mount an external disk before copying or
moving files to it. Of course, then Linux just copies the files to the
mount point folder. Then I have to go in, delete them, mount the drive,
and do the operation over again. Much worse, what if I never realize I
failed to mount the drive and, thinking I have saved the files, unmount
the drive and put it away thinking I now have a safe backup?

The part that is annoying is that Linux will copy the files to the
mount point. Is there a way to make it never do that? Like, if there is
no drive actually mounted at the mount point, give me an error message
when I try to move or copy files there?

If you haven't already guessed, this just happened again tonight. For
the eleventy-eleventh time.

What distro are you using?  Are you mounting as a user or as root?

After logging into my Ubuntu Dapper laptop I get 
a second splash screen. This screen shows icons 
loading for Nautilus and a couple other things, 
and then the gnome desktop appears with my panel 
settings and I'm ready to go to work. Well, I 
did something bad and now it the second splash 
screen where the icons for Nautilus, etc. appear 
no longer displays the icons. It sits there for 
a bit, then suddenly I am dropped back to the 
login screen. I can repeat the login all night 
and all it does is cycle me back to the login 
screen. I can hit Ctrl-Alt-F1 and get to a 
command prompt, but I don't know what to do when 
I get there. However, there are other symptoms, 
plus an explanation of what I was doing before 
this sorry state of affairs came to pass.

I was trying to continue making a backup to a 
USB disk hanging on my Windows desktop (which is 
what I am forced to use to write this). A couple 
days ago I finally learned how to mount this 
drive and then attempted to make a backup of my 
entire Ubuntu partition with rsync. That got as 
far as /lib and then the laptop locked up with 
the cpu at 100%. I restarted the laptop and 
continued using it without incident yesterday 
and today. Today I decided to try again. Well, 
this time it got a bit further, and then instead 
of locking up I was suddenly dumped out of the 
GUI and back to the login prompt. Rsync and 
everything else halted. I logged back in and 
everything seemed fine. 

However, while watching the backup I noticed 
that I had quite a few things that I had meant 
to delete. One was a duplicate folder of fonts. 
Another was an iso of Kubuntu Edgy that I had 
burned to CD for someone at the Clinic. I 
deleted the font folder with Nautilus, then 
decided to burn another CD of Kubuntu and then 
delete the 690 MB file. I tried to launch K3b, 
but it wouldn't launch. Then I tried Gnomebaker 
and it wouldn't launch either. In both cases the 
disk light came on and they appeared about ready 
to appear on the desktop, then they disappeared.

Figuring something was amiss because of the 
aborted rsync episode, I decided to shut down 
and restart. When I restarted I found myself at 
the current situation.

At the command line I opened my CheatSheet file 
with nano and found my mount command for the USB 
disk. I mounted it and all the files that rsync 
copied to it are all there, including what 
appears to be everything in /etc/X11. Using ls-l 
I viewed the contents of the /etc/X11 folder on 
the USB disk and on the laptop, and they appear 
to be identical (same file sizes and time 
stamps).

Rsync did not complete the copy process, but it 
did copy /bin, /boot, /dev, /etc, /home, 
/initrd, and at least part of /lib. I haven't 
compared the contents of the USB drive to the 
corresponding folders on the laptop, but if the 
/etc/X11 folder is the same, chances are all the 
rest of the folders it copied are the same as 
well. 

I'm dead out of ideas. I seriously need 
suggestions here!

Does /var/log/X.log give any hints as to why its puking?

OK, I may have found something. At the command line I typed 
"startx." That gave me the following:

---------------
xauth: creating new authority file for /jome/jjj/.serverauth.5382
xauth: creating new authority file for /jome/jjj/.serverauth
xauth: creating new authority file for /jome/jjj/.serverauth

Fatal server error
Server is already active for display 0
   If this server is no longer running, remove /tmp/.X0-lock
   and start again

Xlib: Connection to ":0.0" refused by server
Xlib: Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key
giving up
xinit: Unable to connect to X server
xinit: No such process (errno 3): Server error
------------------

I am guessing the problem is in the last five lines. Actually, in the 
two Xlib: lines -- something is screwed up in the connection to the 
X server. 

I googled on Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE and discovered a lot of 
people have had problems with this. Unfortunately, none of the 
suggested solutions that I have found have worked so far.

Oh, log files. Good idea!

Wait ... got no X.log file. Closest I can find is /var/log/Xorg.20.log 
with today's date. There is another one two hours earlier, 
Xorg.20.log.old. I read through them both, but neither had any error 
messages of interest. There were some others, but all dated back 
in 2006. I did a locate for x.log and X.log, but nada.

Tried startx 0:1 and got the same error message.

Deleted /tmp/.X-lock and now I get:

xauth: error in locking authority file /home/jjj/.Xauthority.

Of course, I should have renamed it instead of deleting it. Now I 
don't have it at all, and don't have a backup handy. On the other 
hand, it didn't work anyway, so no loss.

Problem is that the rsync I did earlier excluded /tmp, so it wouldn't 
have a copy of the file anyway. And all my other backups were 
usually just /home.

It's too late to think clearly. Tomorrow I'll go back to googling. There 
were lots of sites where "Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE" popped up. I 
didn't read very many of them yet.

Is that maybe owned by root?  It should be owned by jjj.  If not, you 
may have suffered some file corruption.  I can't tell whether to 
suspect that the lockups and such caused the drive to go down sideways 
or something in the gui+backup, lockup or whatever just accidentally 
put root running X in jjj's environment.  I can't remember whether the 
procedure is to touch the file, or remove it or what.  I can say that 
I've seen it before, but all I remember is that it was a slight speed 
bump.  AFAICT, neither the lock nor the authority file contain anything 
that a fairly healthy system can't figure out for itself.  Probably 
just should have gotten deleted and didn't because of the crash.

should be as simple as making the mount point read-only. As soon as you mount a 
new filesystem on it, the permissions change to the permissions of the mounted 
filesystem.

I spent from about 8 am to 1 pm on it today, but I still can't log in to 
my account as jjj. It just keeps dumping me back to the login 
screen.

However, if I hit Ctrl-Alt-F1 I can get to the command line, and then 
I can log in as jjj. Unfortunately, everything I have tried at the 
command line has not resolved the problem.

I can also boot to the Recovery option in the Grub menu, which 
gets me to a command line as root. From there I can do "startx" 
and then a GUI comes up. But it is not jjj's GUI, it is root's GUI 
(root's Gnome desktop settings). However, it does have Firefox and 
I can at least google to see if I can find other possible solutions 
without having to use the Windows desktop.

Once, while booting with the Recovery option, the boot process 
discovered a segmentation fault, fsck came up, and went through 
hda2. It didn't report any errors, and the computer thereafter booted 
normally. But maybe there was file corruption. In any event, the 
problem remains, so if the problem was caused by something 
happening to the filesystem, it is still a problem.

The MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 is apparently located in the 
~/.Xauthority file. I noted that this file was owned by root, so I took 
ownership of it as jjj. The /tmp/X0-lock file was also owned by root, 
so I took ownership of it as jjj as well. Both of these are supposed 
to be recreated automatically, so I also tried renaming them. None 
of this helped.

The rsync backup that I did the other day did successfully copy 
everything from /home, so I went there and copied the ~/.Xauthority 
file to the laptop. Still can't log in.

Man xauth lists a lot of options, only some of which were clear to 
me. One was "xauth list," which lists the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE 
numbers in .Xauthority. I ran this command before and after 
copying the old .Xauthority file from the backup, and afterwards the 
numbers were different. Still no joy, though.

One google site suggested /etc/init.d/gdm stop and then restart. It 
stopped it with [ok], but when I did /etc/init.d/gdm start I got [fail]. I 
suspect it failed for the same reason that it won't start on logging in 
at the GUI login screen. However, I don't clearly understand the 
difference between Gnome display manager (gdm) and X.

Another site suggested that (although dangerous) "$ xhost +local" 
would allow all users in. The command worked without error 
message, but I still can't log in as jjj.

I tried creating a new user (useradd), thinking that I could just 
make /home/jjj the new user's home directory. But Linux puked up 
that idea -- every user needs to have a home folder that is unique 
and can't be written by other users.

Another suggestion that didn't work -- "system-config-display --
reconfig." Just got a "command not found" error.

Suggestions that I haven't tried yet (don't understand them):

dpkg -reconfigure -a
dpkg -reconfigure xdm

I can also note that this problem started the first time I shut down 
and restarted after updating the kernel and nvidia-glx a couple days 
ago. Note that I am using the nv driver, though, not the proprietary 
nvidia driver. At one time I did use the proprietary driver, and 
evidently Update Manager still thinks it needs to be kept updated. I 
went back to the nv driver months ago, so the fact that I changed 
drivers couldn't be related to this problem.

Any other suggestions? Anyone?

I'm off to get a haircut. Maybe with less hair on my head the brain 
will function better.

If you are using gnome you might try the following.  I have seen
problems in the past with some of my kids accounts and the following
fixed those issues.  I'm sure I could have eventually found the problem,
but figured it was just as easy to let them reconfigure their
desktop(s).

As user jjj from a console login execute the following command and then
try to login via xdm/gdm

mv ~/.gnome2_private ~/old_gnome2_private

This will lose most of your settings related to your desktop.  If this
fixes the problem you can try to dig down and see exactly what
file/folder causes the problem by moving them one at a time from
~/old_gnome2_private to ~/.gnome2_private.

I have regular Ubuntu and Kubuntu 32-bit CDs, and a regular 
Ubuntu 64-bit CD, plus an Ubuntu 64-bit DVD, all Edgy 6.10. I will 
be at the Clinic, and these CDs are already in the car.

Thanks for the suggestion. It did not work. :(

While doing an ls command I also noted the following folders:

.gnome_private
.gnome
.gnome2

So I did the rename to "old" trick on them as well. Still can't log in. 
I noted that attempting to log in after doing the above renamings 
caused a new instance of each folder to be created. But I'm still 
stuck.

One way to do this is to wrap the mount in a script that renames the
mount point just before mounting it, and another script that renames
it back after unmounting.   That way, there is no directory at the
mount point, under normal conditions.

There might be some things you can do with permissions, too.

Most new Intel and AMD chips that don't target the lowend of the market will 
have either one of their hardware virtualization setups built-in. 

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization_Technology
"It is available on most Pentium 4 6x2, Pentium D 9x0, Xeon 3xxx/5xxx/7xxx, 
Core Duo and Core 2 Duo processors (excluding the T5200 & T5500). On some 
implementations, IVT support may be switched off in the BIOS/EFI."

"AMD processors using Socket AM2, Socket S1, and Socket F include AMD 
Virtualization support. In May 2006, AMD introduced such versions of the 
Athlon 64, Turion 64, and 64-bit Sempron processors. AMD Virtualization is 
also supported by release two (x2xx series) of the Opteron processors."

If you have any doubts about a particular processor, the Intel or AMD sites 
are somewhat useful, although it's not a heavily advertised feature so you 
have to go digging into the detailed specs.

I know in my own limited experience, it makes a noticeable improvement in 
Parallels on my Macbook Pro to turn VT on.

HTH,
-Dane

No announcement yet, so here's one:

   Linux Clinic
   1 to 5 PM, Sunday January 21
   Free Geek
   Community Technology Center
   1731 SE 10th Avenue
   Portland, OR 97214
   503-232-9350

Directions here: http://www.freegeek.org/map.php
Map: http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1731+SE+10th+Avenue+97214

Bring your Linux computer with problems, and others at the clinic
will help you with them.  More importantly, bring your old or new
Linux skills, and help others.  We will have monitors and keyboards,
power and internet connection and wifi.

Bring your cheap unsupported Wifi card, and we will laugh at you, not
with you.  However, stop by Fry's and buy one of the brown-box refurbished
Netgear WG511T ( WG511TNAR ) wifi cards for $18, and we will complement
you on the wisdom of your purchase, and help you get it running.

NOTE: Free Geek is closed during the Linux Clinic, and they won't be
answering the phones.  Please enter through the south door, next to the
Thrift Store.  We'll have a sign by the door.


Special Topic today:  Setting up VMware and Windoze virtualizers.  If
you still need to run a few offbeat windoze apps, and they don't work
with Wine or Crossover Office, VMware is a fairly easy way to run a
copy of Windoze in a virtual window.  To install it on your own machine,
you will need Windoze install disks and a valid 25 digit license key; if
you want to violate copyright laws we don't want to know about it.  If
you have another virtualizer that will also run Windoze on older
hardware, that will also be interesting.

So the X-server starts up, this is merely a problem with XDM/the desktop
environment? (you get the graphical login box, just you get kicked back
out?)

This means running your desktop environment as root. This is a bad idea
as it is complex software not really written to run as root. In
particular graphical web browsers are a distinct no-no as root.

This would likely hit ephemeral files, not ones that stick around. Still
something to be wary of.

~/.Xauthority should be owned by you, it is also ephemeral. Deleting it
is safe, just in-operation X sessions will have problems. /tmp/.X0-lock
is also ephemeral and should be owned by root (it is the X-server making
sure not to collide with other instances).

X is refering to the X-server, the piece of software that actually draws
things on your screen. gdm/XDM are X-clients that tell the X-server what
to draw. Notably they tell the X-server to draw a box on the screen with
the words "login", "username" and "password"; as with `login` they then
switch to the appropriate user and run other X-clients as specified by
the user's environment.

> Another site suggested that (although dangerous) "$ xhost +local"

> message, but I still can't log in as jjj.

Unlikely. This only effects the current session, it would allow you to
run X-clients and have them draw on the display, but it wouldn't change
whether you could login.

> Suggestions that I haven't tried yet (don't understand them):
> 
> dpkg -reconfigure -a
> dpkg -reconfigure xdm

Simply run those commands is what is ment. They reach into Debian's
package manager (which Ubuntu uses) all tells it to run through the
configurations and try to redo them.


>From the sounds of things, try these steps:

Remove ~/.Xauthority (it will be recreated)
Rename ~/.xinitrc ~/.xsession and ~/.xclients if they exist, these allow
users to change the environment in interesting ways. They're a likely
source of problems.

Boot to single-user mode ("Recovery mode"), and remove everything in
/tmp. Make sure not to remove the directory /tmp, just all of the
contents thereof (if you accidentally do that, the ownership is
root:root, and the mode is 1777).

Try logging in, if it still fails, look at the contents of
~/.xsession-errors if that points you at something you can fix, do so.
If not, report the contents.

I realize that this of no use to you, but it is indeed possible to get

The .Xauthority file was there. I also recreated it, about a hundred
times. I googled all over the net and found dozens and dozens of sites
relating to the "Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE -1" error. None of the
suggestions worked. I spent about ten hours in all trying to get my
login back. I could log in using the Recovery option and, as root, I
could do startx. I could also boot the regular version (which required
my jjj login) and instead of logging in go to a command line with
Ctrl-Alt-F1. But even if I sudo-ed things I could not get the gdm
screen to come up when I was jjj. I would always get bumped back to the
graphical login screen.

About 8:30 last night I finally gave up. I was running out of web sites
with suggestions. I had posted questions on Ubuntu forums, but had no
responses. I decided I had no choice but to reinstall. That meant a
couple more days lost reinstalling and reconfiguring gnome and
applications. As a last ditch before reinstalling I decided to try a
dist-upgrade. I was hoping that doing so would fix the problem, yet
preserve my existing settings and installed applications. It took a
couple hours with my home cable connection, but when it was finished I
was able to log in again as jjj. Yay! 

A few things were broken, but they looked like they'd be easy to fix --
a couple launch icons on the gnome panel, for example. Indeed, things
didn't look too bad. But then I discovered that it broke the wireless.
Wireless broke over a year ago upgrading from Hoary to Breezy, and
again later upgrading from Breezy to Dapper, so breaking the wireless
was not surprising. However, this time I could not get it working. The
instructions failed at a make command. And today at the Clinic I
discovered that the upgrade has perpetuated something that has
apparently been broken for some time -- my Grub boot menu. There is
another bare-bones and never used installation of Ubuntu Dapper on
hda3, and evidently the Grub menu item that I am booting to in order to
launch the real installation on hda2 is actually reading the boot menu
on hda3. Hence, although the upgrade installed kernel 2.6.17, I am
booting to 2.6.15. But the make command is looking for a dfferent
kernel. Not finding it, it fails.

So my next activity will be to fix Grub. That may be a challenge,
considering how borked it appears to be. In the meantime, the computer
is running with my normal login, all programs are still working (sort
of) and all my files are intact.

Thanks to all for the suggestions, and especially to Keith at the
Clinic today for helping figure out where the problem is.

This is rather old, as I discovered it shortly after upgrading to
Dapper last summer. But it may help. I know I successfully used the

Indeed; and a little more hand-holdingly:

# chmod 0555 /whatever

It may not be entirely fool-proof; if you're doing the copying as root,
it could very well ignore the permissions and let you write--that's why
it's a superuser.

Before you do this, you might find it helpful to touch a file with a
name like 'filesystem-is-not-mounted', so you'll know immediately if it
is or isn't.

Subject: [PLUG] Arachne...
Message-ID: <20070119135230.gwzt0a38rogg0s4s@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Anyone played around with Arachne on Linux?

Doesn't seem to be as capable as Mozilla.  I've been trying to play around
with on an old 486 DX2-66 with 20 megs ram running Freedos 1.0.

I created an 8 meg ram drive for the cache.

How do I exit Arachne?

I've been trying to log into my Horde 3.0.3 via Arachne but it just seems
to say loading and doesn't get any futher...

Is there a trick to use the ramdisk driver on freedos to possibly load up
Ubuntu???  Running twm and mozilla seamonkey under X would be quite nice.

Message-ID: <a49cba240701191529x6122c79dl742930fcbf2bdb28@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Group,



I am new with Suse and new with this group too. My boss just told me I need
to build an FTP server with Suse 10.0. I installed Suse 10 on the new box
fine. I configured to allow only SSH on firewall and it is wide open. My
question is, I want to allow only the ip range to access SSH to this box
only (192.9.1.0 - 192.9.1.20 and all 187.4.*.*), How do I do that?
SuSEfirewall2/iptables installed. I wasted my 3 days googled here and
googled there, but could not find any thing. Since I am a brand new newbie
with Linux/Suse, please take it easy with me, ok!



Here what I know so far.

Firewall configuration file: /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2

Start/stop firewall: /sbin/SuSEfirewall2 start/stop

That's it!



Thanks for your help Guys and Girls.

Subject: [PLUG] Internet monitor...
Message-ID: <20070120093457.yfp6nu7uqsc4444w@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I want to set up a Linux system so that Internet access from it is monitored
and time restricted.  I'm thinking: SQL database with usernames and passwords
in it along with session timestamps from when you log in successfully.  
  This database could associate level of filtering from say  
Dansguardian with the
users.

I need a check running in the background, at least every 30 minutes,
to enforce time limits.

The system should store the URLs a person goes to after they log
on and allow the Administrator to check that list later.  I also
want to give the the Administrator the information necessary to
monitor MySpace activity specifically.



I probably need to implement for this system:

A log in/Administration PHP based web system.

A PostgreSQL database for: username credentials,
per user filtering required, time allowance, and
storage of session statistics.

A background process which checks at appropriate
intervals on the sessions in the database to
enforce time limits.



So, are there good tools to set up a Linux system to do what I'm describing
already or does some of this need to be developed still?

Which ftp server are you using?

You might be able to do it through /etc/hosts.allow.  If it is something 
like vsftp or proftp, it would be a configuration option for the ftp 
daemon.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0701221149030.30116@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   When I ran 2.x kernels I would synchronize my PDA with jpilot using
/dev/ttyS0 or it's alias, /dev/pilot. Now that I have a 2.6.x kernel
installed I cannot sync the PDA.

   Checking /dev I see that ttyS0 is now a symlink to tts/0. But, changing
the jpilot setting and the softlink to that name does not permit the PDA to
communicate with the desktop. It just sits there until it times out.

   What do you suggest as a device I could use? /dev/pilot->/dev/tts/0
doesn't work and neither does /dev/pilot->/dev/ttyS0.

Rich probably udev voodoo  .. you should be able to run dmesg after you plug

None of my systems ever did that.  Must be some Slackware weirdness.
Have you checked your permissions or tried communicating as root?

Drew,

   The cradel is already plugged in, but I set the PDA in it and tried to
sync the unit to the desktop. Nothing new in dmesg before, during, or after.
Same with /var/log/messages.

Thanks,

Rich

Aaron,

   Bingo!

   Yes, I had checked them, but not all the way down. The links are, of
course, 777. /dev/tts is 755, but ... /dev/tts/0 was 660. As soon as I
changed that to 666 it worked.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction,

Alan,

   I'm really dense today. I have two files: scribus-1.3.3.7.tar.bz2 and
scribus-1.3.3.7.tar.bz2.sig. The latter contains:

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.5 (GNU/Linux)

iD8DBQBFo+8V73uV5/YBZtoRAmskAJ9AX+AAVvtl/Tq7G5396hVojsuP9wCfUnZh
PyIO5+OM3pLysiKKabNJ77c=
=xz3n
-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

   Then, when I use your syntax above I get

[rshepard at salmo /opt]$ gpg --verify scribus-1.3.3.7.tar.bz2.sig 
gpg: Signature made Tue 09 Jan 2007 11:37:57 AM PST using DSA key ID
F60166DA
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found

   So, is there a way to determine if the file's been changed? Or, is the
addition of the signature just for show?

Thanks,

Rich

You'll need the signer's public key in your keyring; try adding
'--keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net' to the command line.  Alternately,
you can find and download the user's public key and import it with
'--import'.

Wil,

   Thank you. I use GPG so infrequently that I forget how to apply it.

The key for the file is not in your keyring.  You need to edit the 
.gnupg/gpg.conf file and uncomment the line with "keyserver-options 
auto-key-retrieve".  GPG is not able to automatically retrieve the keys.

   OK. There is no gpg.conf, but there is an options file which has
(uncommented) keyserver pgp.mit.edu.

Wouldn't it be easier to just run ubuntu on the machine?  (although, I'd
probably recommend a somewhat slimmer-by-default distro for a 486... debian,
or the server version of ubuntu, at least.  From your questions over the
years, you may enjoy doing a LFS install on it, or if you don't want to get
that close to the hardware, but still don't mind spending 3 weeks doing an
install, you could use gentoo.)

Sounds like you are running an older version of gpg.  You might want to
upgrade.

   According to both gnupg.org and /var/log/packages, I have the most
current, stable version -- 1.4.6 -- installed here.

Weird.  I have the same version, but a different config file name.  Maybe 
it looks for either.

   Well, the contents of ~/.gnupg are:

 	options  pubring.gpg  random_seed  secring.gpg  trustdb.gpg

All but random_seed date from January 2005; random_seed was modified last
December.

I haven't tried it (SL with any client) yet. I'll have a bit more time
next month, so I'm just gearing up for it. I heard about it from some
friends who are mostly Mac folk, and use it to get together on line.
They want me to join them.

I went to http://secondlife.com/ to have a look around and found that
they have clients for XP and OS-X, so I went to their contact page and
started a question about when they'd have a Linux client. I was
impressed to find that their contact page is "smarter" than a simple
e-mail entry form. After clicking the submit button, they returned a
page that said that they didn't actually submit my question, yet, and
gave me a list of links, with abstracts, that their engine thinks are
related to my question. The first one was a link to a page offering an
alpha client. They have caveats about using it -- something to do with
changes made from the alpha client being permanent. I still don't know
enough about SL to know what that means, but I'm glad to be warned up front.

I'll be giving SL a try sometime next month. Meanwhile, if anyone's
tried the alpha client, I'd like to know about any other gotchas.

By time limits you mean no more than 10 minutes from when they logged in 
to begin surfing?  Or by certain hours of the day?  DG has filtergroups 
functionality built in.  This can be authentication against LDAP.  But 
database integration is not something I've sen talked about on the DG list.

As for monitoring, newer versions (alpha, but use it it's stable) have 
email reporting, but it's not something I have got into yet.  I'm going 
to soon though.

Subject: [PLUG] Godawful Grub mess
Message-ID: <20070122224439.5e666ee0.johnxj@comcast.net>

While trying to install ndiswrapper at the Clinic Sunday I discovered
that my Grub boot menu.lst files are a hopeless mess. I need to fix it
just on general principles, but also because I am incapable of
installing ndiswrapper until I get the right kernel booted.

First, some basic facts:

There are three partitions:
	hda1 - 1 GB swap
	hda2 - 60 GB, my real installation, upgraded on 1/17 to Edgy
	hda3 - 8 GB, an unused installation of Dapper, bare bones.

Both installations are Ubuntu amd64. Each automatically mounts the
other's partition at boot. While booted into in my real installation
(hda2), I opened the /boot/grub/menu.lst files on each partition with
Gedit, printed them out, and also copied and pasted them into an OOo
document which I exported to PDF for reference purposes. I also saved
each file as menu.lst.backup_1/22/2007.

The problem:

The menu.lst file on hda2 lists eight options. The menu.lst file on
hda3 lists 16 options. The actual menu I see at boot time lists 16
options (see below). However, four of the 16 options I see at boot time
boot me to the hda2 installation, four boot me to the hda3
installation, and the other eight boot to hda3 but are broken (mouse
and keyboard dead). In each case the options come in groups of four.
The following was painstakingly written down from the boot menu I see
on the screen, and will illustrate what I mean by "groups of four." For
convenience I have numbered them. To keep each option all on one line,
U=Ubuntu, k=kernel, rm=(recovery mode) and hda2=(on /dev/hda2).

------
1)
U k 2.6.15-27-amd64-generic
U k 2.6.15-27-amd64-generic (rm)
U k 2.6.15-23-amd64-generic
U k 2.6.15-23-amd64-generic (rm
U memtest 86+

Other operating systems
2) 
U k 2.6.15-26-amd64-generic (hda2)
U k 2.6.15-26-amd64-generic (rm) (hda2)
U k 2.6.15-25-amd64-generic (hda2)
U k 2.6.15-25-amd64-generic (rm) (hda2)
U memtest 86+ (hda2)

3)
U k 2.6.15-26-amd64-generic (hda2)
U k 2.6.15-26-amd64-generic (rm) (hda2)
U k 2.6.15-25-amd64-generic (hda2)
U k 2.6.15-25-amd64-generic (rm) (hda2)
U memtest 86+ (hda2)

4)
U k 2.6.15-26-amd65-generic
U k 2.6.15-26-amd65-generic (rm)
U k 2.6.15-25-amd65-generic
U k 2.6.15-25-amd65-generic (rm)
U memtest 86+
-----

Now, the weird part is that (1), (2) and (3) boot to hda3, although (2)
and (3) are broken. Yes, I know (2) and (3) say "hda2" but they
definitely boot to hda3. And (4) is the only one that boots to hda2.
Yes, I know it doesn't say "hda2," but that's what it boots to. And,
while (4) boots to hda2, it should list kernel 2.6.17-10-generic, since
that is what the upgrade to Edgy installed. (And 2.6.17-10 is definitely
there, although I am not able to boot to it.)

I have some suspicions how this mess came about (either a corrupted
hard disk or buggy upgrade utilities from Ubuntu, or both), but I am
less concerned with how it happened than how to fix it.

Over the past 24 hours I have read quite a few docs on Grub, but a lot
remains unclear. For one thing, how does Grub know exactly which kernel
to boot? Sure, the kernel is listed in the menu, but some of those
kernels exist in both partitions and it is choosing the kernel on the
wrong partition. In fact, how does it even know which menu.lst file to
display?

John,

I would help a lot if you could post the actual menu.list file/files
contents. 

Remember that the boot/root devices are actually specified by the 'hd(n,m)'
specifier, where hd(0,1) means hda2, and hd(0,2) means hda3.

The menu.lst file is determined when you install grub.  Which of you
installations was the most recent?

One of the installation parameters specifies which device has the grub 
directory
of interest.   During installation grub looks around for other candidate
OS and creates entries for them. You seem to have four different
versions of the kernel (-23, -25, -26, -27) spread across two devices.
If you look in hda2/boot and hda3/boot you shoud see several versions
of the kernel there.  (there are soft links to them in the / directory).

This may be old news to you.  Copies of the menu.list files would really
help.

This may be a Slackwareism.  The options file is the old  name for the
config file.  It has probably been changed so that anyone who upgraded did
not need to rename it.

Slackware -- Its 1995 forever!

They are kind of long to post here, and can't send attachments to the
list. But I sent them as an attachment to you off-list.

This I was already aware of.

I think this is part of the source of the problem. First I had an
installation on hda2 of Breezy, and hda3 did not yet exist. I tried to
upgrade it to Dapper and the apt-get dist-upgrade hopelessly borked it.
After a week of trying to fix unmet dependencies I created hda3 on an
unused portion of the disk and installed a fresh Dapper on it. I
continued to use this and eventually ended up recreating everything I
had originally had on the now-borked Breezy-Dapper hda2. But hda3 is
only 8 GB and I needed the space (60 GB) of hda2. So after a month of
working only in the hda3 Dapper, I reformatted hda2, then rsynced hda3
to it. Unfortunately, this resulted in a corrupted filesystem. Later I
discovered that the filesystem corruption was probably caused by a
flaky hard drive connection (since fixed, I hope). In fact, it may have
already been corrupt at the time I rsncyed hda3 to hda2. After fsck-ing
both partitions the filesystems were back to normal and I was able to
use the hda2 installation. After I was satisfied that it was OK, I
wiped out hda3 and installed a fresh Dapper on it just to use as a
rescue installation. Afterwards I ended up with the menu I posted
earlier. 

As you can see, the problem was caused by 1) user incompetence, 2)
filesystem corruption and (possibly), 3) install/update utilities that
didn't operate quite the way they should have.

It is now morning and the first cup of coffee is starting to work. I
now realize that Linux cannot boot from two menu.lst files. It is using
one or the other. Since the one on hda3 is the latest to be installed,
and since it has 16 entries, the same number as I see on the
screen during boot, that is probably the one that is being used.
Theory: The upgrade of hda2 to Edgy probably updated that one (hda3)
and did not touch the one on hda2, because it would realize that the
menu.lst file on hda3 is the one that was actually used to boot. 

Unfortunately, while that sounds logical to me, the actual entries in
the two menu.lst files does not bear this out. The upgrade to Edgy
definitely added the 2.6.17-10 kernel to the installation on hda2, but
that kernel appears only in the menu.lst file on hda2. In fact, it is
the first entry in the hda2 menu.lst file. Yet the 2.6.17-10 kernel
does not appear on the screen during boot. So it may be that the
upgrade to Edgy modified the menu.lst file on hda2 (thinking that it
was the correct menu.lst file to change, since that was the
installation that was being upgraded), when it should have upgraded the
menu.lst file on hda3. At least that is my current theory.

At this point I think I need to:

1) Figure out which kernels are available to boot to in each
installation -- and maybe do some tidying up of kernels, since I think
I have a surplus of kernels in each installation.

2) Take the menu.lst file from hda2 (remember I have backup copies of
both originals) and edit out all the current list entries to make entries
for just the kernel options for each installation, then make Grub use
this menu.lst file.

To learn: 

1) How to figure out which kernels are available in each installation,
which ones I should save (just the most recent two, I would presume),
and how to get rid of (uninstall) the others. One of the things I don't
understand is the difference between "image," "headers," "kernel,"
"source," and the vmlinuz* files that I see scattered around. I have
known for some time that the boot menu had some entries that were
broken, but as long as there was one that worked for each installation
I was too lazy to do anything about it. The current learning exercise
is happening because I discovered (after upgrading hda2 to Edgy) that I
cannot reinstall ndiswrapper (broken by the upgrade) because the make
command won't work. I need to figure which
kernel-image-headers-source-vlinuz* parts I need in order to get the
make command to work on hda2 Edgy.

2) How to edit the Grub menu.lst file (the docs I already have should
be adequate for this).

3) How to make Linux use the new menu.lst file to boot from (probably
also in the docs).

Today I'll have most of the afternoon free to work on this. Meantime,
any further comments, suggestions and observations are welcome. Thanks
for the suggestions so far. :)

Message-ID: <20070122132128.2s3y6t6lckgwg8sc@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I have a perl socket program called setdodoip.pl.

I want to make sure it is running from a bash script.


There is the option of doing:

`ps ax|grep 'setdodoip.pl'|tr -s ' '|cut -d ' ' -f1`

to get a process id if setdodoip.pl is running.


Hmm, isn't there an easier, generic, and more reliable
way to check if a program is running than trying to
filter the process id of it from the output of the ps
command?

One thought is to have setdodoip.pl create a file when it
starts.  Trouble is, that file could still exist when
setdodoip.pl isn't running.  In the perl script, can I
add deleting the file I create when the process is
killed or doesn't start?

Be warned that 'pidof' might not be in your path. On redhat-ish
distros it is installed as /sbin/pidof, and non-root users don't
normally have the /sbin directory in their PATH.

John,

Sounds like you are on the right track. Here are a few points.

1. The hda3 menu.list actually contains about 20 entries. There are
several between the 'AUTOMAGIC' comment lines, and several after it.
One of the comments in the menu.list file is about option 'howmany',
and indicates that only the FIRST instance of a repeated kernel spec is
displayed in the grub boot list. Some of the kernels are repeated in 
menu.list, so you only see 16 at boot time. (There are about 4 for
'memtest86').
I'm not sure what the criteria are for 'repeated', but it obviously
applies.

2. Grub is going to continue to boot from hda3 (the most recent install 
target) until you force it to do otherwise. One way is to
re-install the grub boot block from a
booted hda2. That should tell grub to look for menu.list on hda2.
You will need to have an existing 'menu.list' file in directory
/boot/grub. Look at commands 'grub-install' (installs the boot block)
and 'update-grub' (recreates menu.list). You can exercise finer grain
control with 'grub-install' if you want to, but you really need to know
more about grub before you do that.

3. Some 'grub links' that I have used (I know how you like research)
http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/p15.htm
http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/grub/grub.htm
http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/index.html#Top

4. A clean install will automatically do the bootloader (grub/lilo)
installation unless you skip that step. I use the alternate install CD,
which allows you to bail out at any point (that '<Go Back>' option is
reachable with the tab key), or you can simply refuse all boot loader

OS installations.)

5. There are usually two places that the kernel files show up. The
originals are in /boot, and / has soft links to some of them. There are
five files of interest for each kernel: a 'vmlinuz' file, an 'initrd' 
file, and
'abi' file, a 'config' file and a 'System.map'. Only the 'vmlinuz' and
'initrd' files are linked in /. You should remove all of those that you
don't need, and remove any references to them in menu.list.

gconfd-* should be 700 owned by the user.  I am not certain what the orbit 
one   is, but my guess is the same permissions.

Message-ID: <20070123200404.Q99771@eehouse.org>

I'm looking for a new ISP.  This is a FAQ, in the literal sense, but
you can't write a FAQ entry about it because the answers differ with
what you're looking for.  Here's what I'm hoping for, anyway.

* looks to all the world like eehouse.org: URLs resolve, mail comes
  from there, etc.

* shell access via ssh (I read all mail with mutt) to a Linux or *BSD
  host

* web hosting (my sites are non-commercial, so low bandwidth limits ok,
  but one of them will occasionally chew some CPU cycles)

* cgi can be perl, and, ideally, self-built binaries

* tech support with a clue, but needn't respond immediately

* cost appropriate for non-commercial use: <= $15/month.

* bonus if they're in the NW and could be my access point from Qwest
  DSL, saving me the $10/month I'm paying Qwest for "ISP" services
  I don't use.

I don't need root access as long as they keep the environment up to
date.  Actually, I already have everything I need with one exception.
My current ISP runs an ancient FreeBSD [4.10] whose compilers can't
handle templates, C99 features -- pretty much any code I've written in
the past five years.  Oh yeah, and there's 0 tech support, even when
they break bash.

(I'm prepared to hear that this is good for what I'm willing to pay.
If so, I guess I'll live with it.  But a guy can hope.)

Thanks,

--Eric

Eric,

   I've been with Aracnet (now SpiritOne) since the beginning of June 1999.
I've had only the highest quality service from them. They host my web site
and used to host my mail; that's in-house now. I had shell access, but gave
that up when I stopped using a dial-up modem.

   Their SysAdmin is outstanding; I cannot praise him enough. Their tech
support folks are all outstanding and most of them -- at least, the ones
with whom I've dealt over the years -- know linux.

   I pay by the year, and they just charge my card when it's renewal time.

   There are several other local ISPs who offer equivalent outstanding
service. You won't go wrong with any of them.

   Oh, I forgot. They've taken over from Verizon for the DSL line which saves
me hassles on the very rare occasions when something breaks. They're in
Beaverton and used to have their servers located in the Pittock Building
(where my last employer used to have offices before they folded).

Just a comment:  Remove the kernels from menu.lst *first*.  It doesn't
matter if the files are on disk or not, aside from the aesthetics of running
'ls' in / and /boot, assuming everything works.

After getting the grub menu behaving correctly, and after getting
ndiswrapper working, and anything else you run into, then delete the extra
kernels.  Until you get everything working, you never know, one of those
kernels might be the one you need.  (or you might delete the wrong one by
accident).

Second on Aracnet.  I have been running my mail server off my DSL line for 
a couple of years now.  I have been very happy with their service.

You also might try Hevanet.com.

   I'm rather stuck on this one, and no one on the SQL-Ledger list is
responding to my request for help.

   SL is running on the local httpd, and I log in with:
http://localhost/sql-ledger/login.pl

   This works, and I see the login page. However, when I enter my password
and press [Enter], this error is shown:

Error!
users/rshepard.conf : Permission denied

   /usr/local/sql-ledger/users is owned by nobody.nogroup, and had 755
permissions. I changed it to 777 but this still does not let me log in.
Since it's world writable and executable, I assume that both I and apache
have full access.

   The files in ../users/, specifically 'rshepard.conf', are owned by me with
755 permissions.

   Obviously, something broke during my system upgrade, but I don't see what
it is.

   Help appreciated.

What is the permissions on /usr/local/sql-ledger?  Should be 711 or 755.

These files should be owned by nobody or whoever the web server runs as.

   I'm trying to set up FuzzyOCR as a plug-in to SpamAssassin. Wrote to the
author several days ago but have not received a response. The errors I'm
seeing appear to be perl issues or OS issues, not specifically related to
the application.

   Here's the contents of /etc/mail/spamassassin/:

BUGS               MANIFEST       contrib/            sample-nonspam.txt

and here is the error message I see:

method "new" via package "FuzzyOcr" at (eval 30) line 1.

   I changed the perms on FuzzyOcr.pm and Logging.pm to 755. I don't
understand why perl failed to parse the plugin
/etc/mail/spamassassin/FuzzyOcr.pm since a copy of that module is in that
directory. Further, FuzzyOcr/Logging.pm is also in /etc/mail/spamassassin.
The error at line 24 is:

use FuzzyOcr::Logging qw(debuglog errorlog warnlog infolog);

   Since I don't know perl, I'm lost here.

Not sure .. I've had it happen  before on my boxen running Slackware. When
the above method fails (which it did) I go into a perl shell and install via
CPAN.

perl -MCAP -e shell
cpan>install <Module Name>

Might be worth a shot? I know I send out lots of stabs in the dark .. I have
to eventually be right ;-)

Having been an IINet employee  they've cleaned up their act the last few
years but support leaves alot to be desired IMHO. I've never heard anything
but good reviews about SpiritOne/Aracnet since my days back at Teleport.

This strikes me as an excellent suggestion. I did verify that my "real"
installation of Edgy on hda2 has all the files indicated by Tony
previously for:

2.6.17-10-Generic
2.6.15-27-amd64-Generic
2.6.15-26-amd64-Generic
2.6.15-25-amd64-Generic

The first one is the one installed by Edgy and, therefore, the one I
want to list first as the default to boot.

I edited the menu.lst file on hda2 and made it say the above list, plus:

2.6.15-27-amd64-Generic on hda3

I don't much care about the Dapper installation on hda3 because it has
never really been used. Push come to shove I can reinstall it with no
loss. I know it has both the -27 and -23 kernels, but I added just the
-27 to the menu.lst to keep it short and simple.

I have not touched the menu.lst file on hda3. After saving the new
menu.lst in /boot/grub on hda2 I restarted the computer. The menu list
is identical to what it was before -- proof that it is using the
menu.lst file from hda3.

Now I need to make Grub use the menu.lst file on hda2. I have read the
official Grub manual, read man grub, read grub info, googled for an
hour, and I'm not sure what command to enter to do that. Closest I can
find is a website that suggested:

grub> install (hd0,1)/grub/stage1 d (hd0) (hd0,1)/boot/grub/stage2 p (hd0,1)/grub/menu.lst

Unfortunately, said web site gave zero explanation of what any of the
above does. I am guessing that it makes Stage 1 on the MBR of hda, then
tells Stage 1 to display menu.lst from /boot/grub on hda2. But I don't
have any idea what the "d" and "p" do in the line.

It's hard to find documentation for what I need to do because 99% of
the Grub documentation assumes there has never been more than one
menu.lst file.

As usual, suggestions welcome.

Just have it flock a file exclusively.  Then try to get that flock, because
if you can, the program is gone.

See examples of Perl flock at my "highlander" solution ("there can be only

The explanation for that command line is at
http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/install.html#install

That is actually a pretty good manual. It also suggests that you don't
use the 'install' command, but instead use the 'setup' command.
Here <http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351> is a Ubuntu Forum 
post from someone who did it that way. The
thread is about installing from a LiveCD, but the method is general
(i.e., doesn't matter where you do it from as long as you booted into
linux somewhere and the grub utilites are installed). You should
verify that the grub stuff is really installed on hda2; I assume that
is your desired root device.

Here is another suggestion. Copy the 2.6.17-10 stanzas (stanza means
everything between 'title' and 'boot', inclusive) from the hda2 menu.list
to the hda3 menu.list, at the bottom. Change hd(0,2) wherever it exists 
in those
stanzas to hd(0,1). (I'm assuming here that the 2.6.17-10 kernel really
is on hda2). Change those ugly-looking root=<nasty-id-string> things
to root=/dev/hda2. Reboot. The 2.6.17-10 kernel selections should appear 
in the boot menu now. Select one, then do the grub
install business. Then do the cleanup business.

Hi Rich,

That does sound odd.  @INC is where perl looks for modules, and it does 
appear that your program has added that directory to @INC.  The "failed 
to parse plugin" message hints that there's an eval somewhere trying to 
load the plugin (which hints that it might be trying to do something 
else fancy and getting that wrong), but I can't see exactly what's 
wrong from that error.

What does this give you?
  perl -I/etc/mail/spamassassin/ -e 'use FuzzyOcr::Logging'
or
  perl -I/etc/mail/spamassassin/ -e 'use FuzzyOcr'

And, just to be sure
  ls /etc/mail/spamassassin/FuzzyOcr/Logging.pm

If none of those complains, then the frontend is bringing this trouble 
on itself with some black magic gone bad or something.  Maybe a bad 
install, or incompatible versions?

I actually have that manual printed out. But I couldn't understand much
of it.

However, I also have a couple other Linux books here, including Carla's
Cookbook. She has quite a few pages on Grub. It took a bit of trial and
error, but I finally managed to get it set to use the menu.lst file
in /boot/grub on hda2 instead of the one on hda3. Yay!

[Side comment: The reason it took me a long time is because you have to
do "sudo grub" before the grub commands will all work. I was just doing
"grub," the grub prompt would come up, and some commands would work,
but not others.]

When I restarted the new menu came up. I had changed the colors to blue
and white so it was immediately obvious that I finally had the
menu.lst on hda2. However, when I tried to boot any of my new entries
all I could get was the installation on hda3, and that installation was
sometimes screwed up -- e.g., it is still just Dapper, but with some of
the boot entries the Edgy splash screen would appear.

Eventually I found the error. I had used the original menu.lst file in
hda2 as the starting point, since it had the 2.6.17-10 kernel at the
top of the list. I copied and pasted the entries for the Dapper
installation in the menu.lst on hda3 into the menu.lst on hda2 at the
end. When I tried the new entries these last ones were the only ones
that worked properly -- that is, they booted properly into Dapper on
hda3. Reviewing the various entries I noticed that these entries all
said "root=/dev/hda3 quiet no splash." The others all had strange long
numbers starting with "UUID." I replaced the long numbers with the
appropriate "root=" text like the entries for Dapper on hda3, and
voil?! I am currently happily booted into my new Edgy upgrade. As soon
as it came up I heaved a sigh of relief. Then I did uname -r and was
ecstatic to see "2.6.17-10-generic." Yay!

Then I went back to the ndiswrapper problem and ran the make command.
It worked! Yay!

However, for some reason ndiswrapper will not work. I've done the
obvious -- first I blacklisted bcm43xx, then I installed the driver
that is currently recommended, it didn't work, uninstalled it,
installed the driver I used to use, still no joy. Ndiswrapper -l says
the driver is installed and the hardware is present, but iwconfig says
no wireless.

Oh well. Conan is on and I have class tomorrow. I've been through
ndiswrapper three times before. I'll figure it out. But not tonight. :)

A thousand thanks for everyone's help. :)

Everyone:

   Part of the issues have been resolved. It turns out that despite the
installation instructions, the module must be loaded from within
/etc/mail/spamassassin/FuzzyOcr/FuzzyOcr.cf, not from within spamassassin's
init.pre (or v310.pre).

   Changing the load location removed the warning of not finding the module.

   There are still some remaining issues of configuration options being
ignored, but the author did respond to yesterday's mail to him and I've
asked him about those.

   Now I need to learn from where to load ImageInfo.pm, since it's not
loading from init.pre.

   Thanks all. The reports from folks are that once up and running FuzzyOCR
works well.

   It may not be important now, but when SpiritOne bought Aracnet I was
_very_ concerned about continued support for linux and the technical mail
issues. So I called the company. A few hours later, the president of
SpiritOne called me and we had a discussion about my concerns.

   That level of attention to customers tells me a lot about the company.

Well, I'm having a hard time getting the right one.

The correct answer is 24204 in this case, but I'm having
a hard time getting that using pidof.

Using the pidof command was a good suggestion though.

   When I upgraded my distribution a bunch of perl modules went AWOL. The one
critical one still not dragged back to work is DBD::Pg. I need that for
SQL-Ledger to allow me to log in and work.

   As root, I tried to use 'perl -MCPAN -e shell' to 'install DBD::Pg', but
it failed the tests and would not install. Then I forced the install, but
still had server access issues. Dieter (SQL-Ledger's author) suggested this
was because root does not have access to httpd.

   This morning, I downloaded DBD::Pg*.gz, untarred it and went through the
'perl Makefile.PL, make, make test, make install' routine. Of course, it
failed the tests, and I still get server access problems because the module
is still not to be found with 'locate.'

   Here's the contents of today's entries in /var/log/apache/error_log:

[Wed Jan 24 07:59:05 2007] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] File does not exist:

   I seem to be caught in an infinite loop. The tests won't succeed because

either:

so the module won't install. I'm in checkmate.

Help, please,

Rich-
A quick google pulled up the following tip:

It looks to me like the newer version of DBD::Pg requires a newer
version of libpq than you have installed.  Now you say that you
have "Postgres 8" installed so you ought to be okay ... but somewhere
on your system there must be an older copy of libpq.so that does not
have that function.

You probably should fix this by changing your ldconfig search path
so that the newer libpq.so is found in preference to the older.


So I'd do a locate libpq.so and see what you have laying around and upgrade
as necessary. Hope this helps :-)

Drew-

   Oh, darn! I'm so tangled in trying to fix three broken (or weakened) apps
that I didn't look in Google. Apologies are humbly offered.

   I have postgres-8.1.4 installed and 8.2.1 waiting in the wings. I want to
resolve these other three problems (SQL-Ledger, mail system, and a broken
application since I upgraded wxPython to -2.8.0.1); I don't need a fourth
problem.

   Well, ...:

/usr/lib/libpq.so.3.0
/usr/lib/libpq.so.3.1
/usr/lib/libpq.so.4.1
/usr/lib/libpq.so.3
/usr/lib/libpq.so.4
/usr/lib/libpq.so
/usr/local/lib/libpq.so.3.0
/usr/local/lib/libpq.so.3.1
/usr/local/lib/libpq.so.3
/usr/local/lib/libpq.so

   I got rid of the last four because they date back to 2003-2004, except for
the links which were updated during the upgrade.

   OK. Now I try to make and install DBD::Pg. Results to follow.

Thanks,

Rich

Its looks like its returning all instances of /usr/bin/perl  <whatever> can
you invoke setdodoip without referencing perl first? You could always do
something like

pidof /usr/bin/perl setdodoip |awk {'print $1'} which would give you the
correct process id but it might change from time to time so its hard to say
that it would always be correct.

You have '/sbin/pidof ./setdodoip' above. Your script is setdodoip.pl.
I don't know if that makes much difference.

You might experiment with the -x flag, which is supposed to do
"scripts, too" (at least on my system, a quick man pidof should help).

Personally I'd play with drew's suggestion and toss in the script name
like "pidof perl | grep setdodoip\.pl | awk {'print $1'}"

Subject: [PLUG] hostnames in sudoers file?
Message-ID: <7cbc132f0701241030j13c6605ch7b98e9a5d0b3314a@mail.gmail.com>

Can someone help me understand why one would use several hostnames in a
sudoers file? It's my understanding that running sudo will only execute
commands locally. In other words, you cannot grant remote sudo permissions
in a local sudoers file....right? My only guess is that it is for the
convenience of managing a single sudoers file that is distributed to several
hosts. If this is the case, is there an easy way to distribute sudoers files
to many hosts, other than simply scp'ing the file? Or is there a way to
"host" a master sudoers file that all the hosts will look to when sudo is
run? Ouch, that sounds like a potential security risk.

Thanks in advance.

   Results of 'make install' look good:

Files found in blib/arch: installing files in blib/lib into architecture

   Ran ldconfig.
   Restarted httpd.
   Restarted postgresql.

   No joy in Mudville yet. It's turned into a postgres installation issue.

Let us know how it turns out Rich. I'm curious enough now to want to install
this stuff on a test box and see what happens.

They sound great.  Unfortunately the don't "do" DSL in Corvallis.  They
might work as a web hosting provider.  I'm still looking at that but
hoping iinet will do for both.  One of their sales people is looking into
what apps they have available to shell accounts.

Thanks,

Unless its changed you don't get a heck of a lot out of shell accounts. No
ping and you can compile your own binaries as I recall but its a Solaris box
that hosts the shell server so depending on what you're working on it may
not compile at all.

On larger managed networks, configuration files are managed centrally
and then distributed out to the various hosts.  Being able to specify
host-specific options means that you can have one sudoers file that
works across many systems.

As far as means of distribution, there are a number of tools.  Older
home-brewed systems used rdist, rsync, etc.  I am currently using
cfengine[1], although I've been intending to look at puppet[2].  There
are other tools too; see http://www.infrastructures.org for a paper and
discussion.

/me notes that puppet rocks.
I spent some time with Luke (the creator) at LISA'06 in DC, and as soon
as I returned home we started deploying it. Aside from the infrequent
ruby bugs, puppet has been great.

One great benefit of a shell account is the ability to use rsync over 
ssh to push remote web/ftp content and pull web logs.

Also -- and this is a deep-seated bias that may already or soon be 
outdated -- there's no web-based adminstrative interface that can give 
you the customization power of $EDITOR run from the command line.

Indeed; that seems to be the consensus of everyone I've talked to.

The things holding me back at the moment are time and the fact that most
of the boxes I need to manage are AIX, so getting a usable Ruby on them
has been challenging.  (I finally gave up and got a subscription to
TheWrittenWord, but that's only been recently.)

I have sort of casually followed puppet development from early on; I met
Luke in the IRC channel I started for cfengine.  (He actually wrote a
couple articles for O'Reilly on using cfengine a few years ago.)  I
haven't seen many projects follow Agile/XP methods as thoroughly as Luke
has, apparently to much benefit.

Drew,

   The saga continues.

   The permissions on /var/lib/pgsql/data were FUBAR. I finally found
postgres' serverlog and that told me just what was wrong and what the perms
should be. Got that fixed. Postges is now running. But, ... it's back to
that same library error.

   After restarting httpd, /var/log/apache/error_log shows:

[Wed Jan 24 11:46:31 2007] [warn] NameVirtualHost *:80 has no VirtualHosts

   So, back to the postgres list. There are 1,830 hits on Google for the
PQserverVersion bug #2701.

   More when I have it.

Just an idea Rich, maybe removing DBD:PQ, perhaps its still seeing the
forced install module instead of the one you built by hand that seemed to
work?

Drew,

   There is no DBD:PQ. Regardless, something sure looks screwy. According to

   So, when I go look to see why I have three copies in the noted directory,
I find it's not there. When I look in the subdirectory, i486-linux/ I find
another directory, DBD/ which contains 2006-05-05 08:20 Pg.pm. So, there's
only one copy there and it is version 1.49.

   I've asked on the postgres list what version of libpq I need to work with
postgresql-8.1.4.

Thanks,

Bah once again my retardedness shows up. I meant DBD::Pg not PQ .. Atleast

Given a current compiler I should be able to build anything I need,
no?  My problem with my current ISP is that nothing builds with gcc
2.9.5 anymore.  Including the current binutils, making bootstrapping
a contemporary environment more trouble than it's worth.

I haven't used Solaris since 2000, and didn't build much software for
it.  Is it ignored by the open source community?  I'd hope the
mainstream stuff would "just compile" as it does on a modern Linux
distro.

I need/want emacs, subversion, make, gcc, lynx, screen -- nothing
unusual about any of that I'd hope.

Still no word from iinet on whether they provide these.  Sales didn't
know what they are. :-)

   Well, someone on the postgres mail list said that postgres doesn't care
which library is used, but the client does. Ball back in the SQL-Ledger side
of the court.

   Just for giggles, I upgraded SL from 2.6.22 to 2.6.23. When I try to log
in, the splash screen still shows the older version (which it never used to
to), but now I get an access denied error.

   I wonder if it's permissions related.

When I left in 2004 we had emacs and lynx and I'm pretty sure screen. I know
we didn't have subversion and I highly doubt that they would have installed
it since then. Shell accounts were given as is without any form of support.
There wasn't GCC or make but there were the solaris equivalents. I'm
emailing you some contact info privately to pass along to your sales guy to
see if they can find out whats available now.

Drew,

   Unfortunately not.

perl /usr/local/sql-ledger/login.pl 
Can't locate bin/xterm/login.pl in @INC (@INC contains:

   But, it runs in the browser.

   It's been in the local paper the past couple of days, on groklaw.net, and

Subject: [PLUG] irregular monitor flicker
Message-ID: <200701241652.49147.carla@bratgrrl.com>

My nice not-very old (about two years old) 19" CRT has developed a problem- it 
flickers occasionally in an odd way. The screen image shrinks a tiny bit, 
maybe an eight of an inch, then goes back to normal. Sometimes it does it 
several times, then stops. There's no regular pattern to it. Is my monitor 
dying already? The video card is the same age. I checked that its cooling fan 
works, and the case temperature and cooling are fine. I made sure all cables 
are snug.  Any ideas?

   This has become a major PITA. I just tried to send a pdf file to the
printer using lpr. It never came out; when I look at /usr/sbin/printers,
there it sits in the jobs queue.

   I've restarted cupsd.

   I'm able to ping the printer (it's a node on the network).

   Looking at running processes I find these:

   /var/log/cups/error_log ends with:

   In the past when a job wouldn't print it usually turned out to be a stuck
socket or other printer process. Not now.

   What critical step have I overlooked?

I'm far from a guru about CUPS, printing or networking. But I noticed
that you are printing PDF files and that piqued my curiosity because I
have problems printing them as well. I always get output, though --
just not the right output.

My printers are Laserjets and they are networked. I have tried sending
PDF files to them directly with lpr and never have a problem getting
output. But I set up the printers in CUPS and make sure I can print a
test page from the CUPS GUI first. Then, when printing with an lpr or
lp command I use the name of the printer as defined in CUPS. E.g., to
print 10 copies of test.pdf to my Laserjet 8000, whose name in CUPS is
"Laserjet-8000-Series-Postscript-(recommended)" I give the command:

lpr -P Laserjet-8000-Series-Postscript-(recommended) -# 10 test.pdf

or

lp -d Laserjet-8000-Series-Postscript-(recommended) -n 10 test.pdf

REP,

   Regardless of whether the extension is in uppercase, it's worked well
before. Ghostview is the filter and it converts the pdf to a ps file before
shipping it off to the printer (which as a PS module installed). If you use
xpdf or acroread, it converts it prior to printing. But, I've not had any
problems printing from the command line before.

   Notice that the process information I included was for a test page sent by
root's invocation of /usr/sbin/printers. That test page is in .ps format.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0701241756570.21810@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   OK, Drew et al., I got the problem fixed.

   To summarize where we left off at the last reel, during my distribution
upgrade a bunch of perl modules went AWOL. Today I grabbed the source for
DBD::Pg-1.49, built, and installed it.

   Then I started looking at the libpq.so libraries and discovered the old
stuff in /usr/local/lib/ I removed them. But, this was after I built
DBD::Pg. That's why when 'ldd Pg.pm' reported using libpq.so.3 I thought
nothing of it. There's a more recent /usr/lib/libpq.so.3.1. That's not the
one to which the perl module pointed.

   So, a repeat performance of 'perl Makefile.PL, make, make test, and make
install' recreated DBD::Pg with the proper library.

   Now, SQL-Ledger lets me log in. Whew!

   Two down, two to go.

Thats what I sort of figured was going on. Thats why I suggested  removing
the  module and rebuilding after you found the old crusty
libpq.so.3.xlaying around. Glad you got it nailed Rich!

   All fixed. Benign neglect to the rescue. Turned off the printer, did other
things, restarted the printer in /usr/sbin/printers, and it worked. Works.

   Back to having no problems directly printing pdf files from the command
line.

   Three down, one to go.

What brand/model of monitor?

Have you tried this monitor on another machine and received the same results?

A resolution/refresh-rate combination it can't handle?

Have you tried to degauss?

Power/EM issues in your office (experimenting with EMP bombs perhaps)?

Just some ideas.

Dust in the high voltage section of the monitor, causing arcing. 
Internal cleaning fixes that.  It is possible that the problem is
some component failing in the monitor, which will be impossible to fix.

Get it cleaned by a professional if you can;  the high voltage is lethal
and you are too valuable to us to risk.  A TV repair shop will be fine.
If you decide to clean it yourself, be sure to let it sit unplugged a
good long time, surround yourself with non-conductive stuff (rubber
soled shoes), use a big empty bench or table, and keep one hand in your
pocket.  Never ever ever allow a conductive path through your chest
and near your heart.

CRTs are also an implosion hazard, and so you should wear eye
goggles, and have someone around to drag you to the hospital if you
get lacerated by flying glass.  Oh, did I say this was dangerous?
And that I don't want to see you get hurt?

CRTs with power supply problems, or accumulated dust, are fire hazards.
A friend of mine had his house burned down by a flaky monitor;  as
they reconstructed it, parts of the power supply shot three foot
flames.  So attend to it quickly, please - Baked Carla is no more
palatable than Zapped Carla or Lacerated Carla.

It pings, so it has power and data - if the IP address is correct and
nothing else on the network is stepping on it.  Paper?  Jam?  Toner?  

CUPS needs to render the pdf file to Postscript in order to print.
How big is the file?  Is there enough room in /var and /tmp to do
the work?

Have you tried doing pdf2ps on the file, and printing the resulting
postscript?

A couple days ago, I had a lockup that went away when I removed a very
large file from the job queue, and power cycled the printer (HP4M, BTW).
Perhaps something like that will help you.

Mostly it is ignored, but most coding is reasonably OS-independant
(FreeBSD if nothing else) so many things just build.

Those will all build on SunOS, at least with GCC on SunOS. I think Sun's
compiler (named "Forte"/"SunPro", binary `cc`) should build all of those,
but don't quote me on that.

Keith,

   It fixed itself. Could not send a test print, either. Lots of paper and
toner, but I don't use jam on it.

   It was an invoice from the satellite telephone service provider. They've
been sending them like this for over a year.

   No, but I was about to display the document in xpdf and let it send it to
pdf2ps on the way to the printer.

   I shut down the HP LaserJet 5 for a while, it worked when I turned it back
on. Hadn't done this before so I was thrown when my usual fix (look for the
stuck socket in the process list and kill it manually) didn't work.

Many thanks,

Rich

How many routing tables can be created by the ip command?

I know you can use the MARK target in the mangle table with 
iptables to go to say table 3, but can you also go to table

With LARTC, is there a standard way without dynamic routing to
detect that a gateway is down?

I've been trying to go the ping to check for connectivity in a

Out of curiosity, why does someone want shell access at a remote 
address on a distant computer to push programs out to instead of 
setting up a web site in house???  This thread doesn't sound 
like the typical idea most people have of what an ISP is.  Opus
Interactive, ISP I go through, doesn't consider doing backup
dns and mail service for my domain let alone shell access standard
service.  I had a hard time getting Opus to forward email addressed
to a private domain into imap accounts it hosts for us in the event
of a DSL outage.  There is no backup if DSL fails in Scappoose 
unless you have Comcast Cable as well and it doesn't go out
simultaneously.  Unlike Beaverton, Opus and the phone company are
it and the phone company tends to take a week to fix problems when 
they arise.  I don't know why it is generally better in Beaverton
when it comes to down time.  Certainly, equating ISP with shell 
access or hosting is definitely different than what ISP means for 
the average Joe.  I know we only have about 2 telephone repair 
people who go out and that we have to share them with other 
communities.  Why is the price of DSL so high compared to cable?
I know overall that you pay less, but on dollar/speed you seem to 
lose even at Comcast's high rates.  Granted, Comcast forces you to
deal with a dynamic ip address and says no to servers.

This reminds me, I've forgotten what our Opus accounts are and am
wondering if my ISP is still a backup or not.  Personally, I think one
is better off working with a buddy on Opus to act as backup than 
asking Opus directly to be the fallback site.

Just because you use a hosting service like godaddy.com etcetera, does
that automatically mean that your hosted site is backed up in case
of a single hosting site outage?  Are you guaranteed that hosting is
better than bringing a T1 directly into your business and running a web
site in house?  How do you trust a 3rd party with your email etcetera?
After all, what is to stop a hosting site employee from
turning into an email thief and selling what they find to the highest
bidder?  How are these hosting sites profitable?  If they are vmware
based, the licenses for that aren't cheap after all.  How do these
so called clean up services that find damaging information on
the Internet about you and have it removed or get it mitigated 
work?

Here are some of my reasons:

* Home DSL is too unreliable to allow me to run a site from home.
  Hell, my DSL modem alone is so flakey I've had to put it on a timer
  resetting it every 24 hours, so the site's guaranteed to go down
  once/day.  (Qwest does not consider a modem that must be
  power-cycled every few days to be broken.)

* On a more general level, I'd rather not sign up for the security
  headaches assocated with running servers on well-known ports, nor do
  I want to pay for the business-grade service plans that permit it.
  I have a LEAF-based router at home, separate DMZ and trusted LAN,
  etc. -- but I'd still rather keep the public stuff somewhere else.

* Many ISPs won't deliver mail to the IP ranges known to belong to DSL
  providers.

* I traval a lot, and read mail from many different places.  With a
  shell account, I run mutt inside screen and keep it running for as
  long as the host stays up.  I disconnect when the plane closes its
  doors and reconnect from work a few hours later and am right back in
  the emacs session I was using to compose a reply.

* I want to use an email address I will always control, and URLs as
  well.  No more ehouse at some.random.isp.com.  Google still finds links
  to one of my sites at my old ISP (which page doesn't exist) ahead of
  the same page where it's been for the past year.

* Once I'm running sites elsewhere, I have to be able to edit and
  debug them in place.  You can't upload a PHP-based site, let alone
  compiled CGI binaries, and expect them to work on a different host.
  I know that's the goal of scripting systems like php, but it's
  imperfectly realized.

What I'm looking for would more accurately be described as a "shell
account with web hosting" than "web hosting with shell access", but
nobody sells shell accounts any more *except* as part of a web hosting
package.  Including peak.org, where I had such an account for many
years.

Heh, an Actiontec.  Qwest is not the only source of DSL modems.  I use
a Cisco 678 (which I got used), and I have a configured Paradyne DSL
modem on sitting on the shelf, ready to go.

Updating the Actiontec to a current version fixes most of those problems. 
Unfortunatly it turns the configuration page to something seriously ugly.

Ed,

   That's a Qworst issue, not DSL. I have Verizon wire here and it has been
totally reliable for years. Now, the power brick on the Fujitsu modem
croaked a year or so ago, but the Verizon tech loaned me his until I could
buy a replacement. I found one on eBay (whole 'modem') for $18 (with
shipping) that same day; I was the only bidder. Problem solved.

   I let Aracnet handle the security for my web site and DNS services. They
have full-time experts who do an outstanding job. I run my MTA here, and
with the help of the fine folks who populate the postfix, spamassassin, and
FuzzyOCR mail lists, it's now tuned to grand prix performance. My inbox spam
has dropped to zero the past two days ... except for some UCE from Qwest.

   Why not register your own domain name and get a static IP address from
your ISP? Then you can use either fetchmail/getmail to suck it down from
their server or you could run your own.

   I ssh in from any place with free wired or WiFi access and use pine on my
office system from a console on my notebook. Of course, the work I do is
sufficiently non-critical that I don't need to instantly reply to anyone.

   Well, buy your own domain name. Have your ISP of choice point the MX
record to your server.

   I don't do php, but the couple of cgi scripts I've uploaded to my little
corner of the hosting disk are working just fine.

You meant "services" on well known ports right? ;) It doesn't take a 
"server" to do this.

People are only making suggestions.  What way you choose to roll is your 
own.  SpiritOne is still the answer as many have suggested and is what I 
use because of suggestions on this list also.  You should probably just 
check out their page, because all of those types of concerns are 
answered there.  All their "consumer" accounts come with a single static 
as part of their regular service which is very useful.  Business 
accounts are not much more and include four static IP's, again, as just 
part of the deal.

By Wikipedia's calculations, around 1900 lbs of pressure on the front
face of a 17" CRT. Maybe PDX should pave roads with CRTs, they seem up
to the task, unlike the thin asphault used around PDX.

Also from Wikipedia, apparently earlier CRTs could rupture around the
neck and propel the electron guns through the faceplate. Must of been an
/interesting/ experience.

> Keith
> (who is glad that CRTs are slowly becoming extinct)

Except the modern LCDs still don't compete on resolution. Up to 20" LCDs
tend to be 1280x1024 resolution, while at a mere 19" (equiv to 18" LCD)
most CRTs can do 1600x1200 (and I believe some 17" ones could do that).
There is also the black that is far inferior to CRTs.

I'm hopeful about direct-view LED displays (matrix of LEDs, instead of
LEDs as backlight). Except for resolution, that should resolve all the
lingering issues.

I've set up my DSL modem to get its power through a X10 controlled outlet.
A cron job checks world connectivity and reboots it as needed.   
That's only because the Speakeasy supplied modem won't reconnect after the DSL
drops signal.  It runs for weeks at a time without needing the kick.

DSL is great value for those who can withstand infrequent, short term outages.

Okay, why did Linux come into existence?  When I hear about 
BSD on here, it usually seems to be about an old version of 
it.

Is there an anti Linux fervor in the BSD community?  What 
is the critical time this author talks about of 2 years 
when Linux became dominant?

Is BSD overall still maturing or is it stagnant?

SunOS seems to be a recipient of the rise of BSD.  
Why even in this day of Linux is SunOS still popular
at PSU?

How do ISPs know which numbers these are and is this public
information?

Opus DSL hasn't been flaky at all.  I have no problem running
a web site in house on their service.

So, if you are a fiber optics customer you are okay?  But how much
do non DSL broadband connections cost?  How many ip addresses are
available that aren't reserved for DSL?

Is the backbone of the Internet IPv6 based now?  Is the kind of
broadband ISP's feed DSL from expensive because of ip address
shortage or other factors?  How much does getting on the large 
fiber optics networks in South Korea touting 20 mb/s connections 
cost per month in U.S. dollars?  Aside from fiber optics being 
rare in the U.S. because you have to run fiber, how has it become 
cost effective in South Korea?

Is piecewise replacement of a POTS system with fiber optics a
cost effective approach to fiber deployment?  What would it take
to build public fiber rings in small cities and interconnect them
to achieve a larger network?

Does ISP blocking of DSL IP blocks negate the usefulness of static
subnets over DSL?  Is the discrimination solely aimed at the dynamic
address pool?  If I'm not mistaken, DSL's theoretical max downstream
speed is 45 megabits per second.  Most of us are lucky if we can 
do 3 mbps/downstream.  I'm on 1.5 mbps/downstream right now. 

I wish the phone system in Scappoose was publicly owned let
alone locally owned.  I do not like CenturyTel.  I do not
understand why we have nationwide telecommunications
mega corporations that are not accountable to their customers.  
It would be awesome to see the establishment of competitive 
publicly owned telephone companies in the Portland Metropolitan 
Area offering Broadband and local and long distance telephone 
service.



Separately on Comcast:

Why is Comcast consistently above the phone company's DSL in 
price?  Comcast is faster, but the company forces it's 
subscribers to pay more per month.  I've asked why they don't 
offer comparable speed to DSL at a competitive price, but I 
didn't get an answer.  Is it true that cable's performance
dwindles in comparison to DSL as more people in your 
community get on it?  Is Comcast trying to cover 
infrastructure costs going to catch up to the phone 
company and lower the price of off promotion service 
to its customers when it does?  

Are cable IP blocks avoided as well by some ISPs?

FreeBSD is very current.. (stable, not stagnant)

Because Linux is horribly unstable? Its focus is really the desktop, not
large servers. We use Solaris, not SunOS by the way. SunOS was BSD,
Solaris is System V.

Most large companies with critical data will use Solaris, AIX, or $other
for the same reason. Yes, even Google uses Solaris for their critical
corporate servers.

Regarding PSU, in engineering departments, they run tons of software
that is designed for Solaris. That's why you see Sun labs.

Oh blah blah blah blah blah.  I call "Bullshit!"  I have had
approximately zero problems with Linux itself.  Just the other day I had
an AIX 5.3 box crash hard because I had the audacity to attach more than
one packet filter at the same time.  IBM had only recently seen the
problem and didn't actually have a public fix yet.

By the time you've tarted up Solaris or AIX (or FreeBSD, for that
matter) to actually be useful, you've added all the free software you
would have gotten for free with a Linux distribution and it's much less
integrated than it is with a Linux distribution.  The biggest cause of
problems I've seen has been stupid administrators (including me, in
years past)--but Linux is only unique in that regard because, within the
last 10 years, it has usually been the first UNIX that many people start
with.

That sentence makes no sense to me.

Because they have it and know how to use it?  Because the software they
have to run and support only runs on SunOS/Solaris?  Because they're big

Neat!
I know, I'm a troll. But there is some semblance to reality in what I
said. That said, I *do* like Linux.

I really hate that argument. If you want GNU software, then use Linux.
There's nothing wrong with Linux for things where you want
tons-o-software. Even web servers (if they're redundant). And the GNU
package managers for other OS's come with the kitchen sink, so you don't
have to worry about runtime library linking issues. It's not
"integrated" but rather helps with some common issues. (blastwave++)

I tend to focus on the kernel things (like Linux's broken NFSv4
implementation; that greatly saddens me. I touted the fact that the OSDL
tested NFSv4 very well, and they let me down).

True! But I do try to filter those instances out. A kernel panic is a
kernel panic, no matter what the userspace does.

DNSRBL's usually .. and yes it is.

It depends on the loop length from the RT (remote terminal) or Central
Office and other characteristics of the line itself. I'd be happy to post
all of them if anyone is interested.

I doubt it. I would assume most *consumer* IP ranges regardless of access
type are subject to some penalization but this is just conjecture on my
part.

Not really. There is a move to IPv6 but its progressing really slow. Most of
the public networks in SK are subsidized by the government.

Not really, although Verizon is making this happen in their territories
betting on the future (VOIP, Video on Demand ect ect). Its a very signifcant
outlay in capital to replace the aging POTS infrastructure. You'd need
colocation, rights of way from existing telco's or power companies (easiest
from an engineering standpoint for the buildout IMHO) and of course fiber
unless you lease existing dark fiber which is what Google is doing (leasing
existing dark fiber).

Its generally based on the DHCP pool in *my* experience (results not
typical, your experience may differ) ... The current _deployed_ DSL
infrastructure is capable of 8Mbps down max. DSL2 is slowly being rolled out
by manufactures and deployed by a small subset of providers ... I can't
recall off the top of my head what the max down is, it does increase the
distance from the CO you can be and still receive service though.

That may have been the casual division, but formally, the release that
included SunOS 4 (BSD-based) was retitled Solaris 1 in retronaming, and SunOS
5 (SysV-based) was titled Solaris 2.  The reason for the casual naming is that
SunOS 4 had never been "sold" under the Solaris 1 name (except on 386
machines, if I recall), and so we sysadmins talked about "sunos" vs "solaris"
to mean version 4 (bsd) vs version 5 (sysv), together with all the respective
changes in the distro.

So it's a SunOS 4 (or 5) operating system and a Solaris 1 (or 2) distro.
Hence you're both right. :)

People are also asking questions, probably in order to better
understand my needs so they can offer better suggestions.  I'm
answering those questions.

People have suggested iinet and SpiritOne.  I mailed both asking about
what's available through their shell accounts.  iinet replied (after a
second request) that they don't want my business for < $100/month.
SpiritOne sales redirected me to a technical contact who has, over the
course of several days, replied to two additional emails, finally
telling me that the they're in general happy to install packages that
aren't huge security holes and suggesting that I sign up for an
account and be prepared to exercise the 30-day-refund policy if it's
not what I need.  I just did so.

Top flight customer service, as y'all told me to expect.  I think I'll
be happy there (assuming, of course, that they can get basic packages
like emacs installed on their virtual servers).  In a perfect world
they'd be able to host my DSL connection, but their area doesn't go as
far south as Corvallis.

While the static IP is mentioned on SpiritOne's site, there's not much
information about what shell access entails.  I don't even see a
reference to their 30-day policy -- which seems a bit of an oversite
since a temp account is a great way to answer questions that aren't
common enough to space on their site.

Thanks for all the help, folks.  Wish me luck with the test drive.
I'm looking forward to using a competent ISP.

Because userland is important.  I spend most of my life working with
userland, not a kernel directly.  If I'm managing or developing on a
system, I want GNU software, period.  There are few things I hate as
much as being stuck in ksh and having to use standard vi.

But it's not just GNU software--there are certain basic facilities that
are missing or stupid.  Oftentimes trivial stuff, like managing symlinks
in /etc/rc.d/rcN.d (or the lovely Solaris standard, hardlinks).  Do you
know what you have to do to remove from init a static route that was
created with SMIT in AIX? 

 http://nakedape.cc/wiki/PlatformNotes_2fAixNotes section 1.2.4

(And despite the copious pages of documentation written in such a dull
manner that one's brain is tempted to try lycanthropy, not documented.)

SUMA was touted as a killer new tool for automating downloads of
software updates from IBM, but it doesn't fucking work half the time:

http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/emergingtech/fsherman/archives/aix-maintenance-strategies-part-iii-10208

And the ability to find what ports are open by what processes?  Not
without a third party tool (lsof, which recently started segfaulting for
me on all of my AIX systems).  How about a facility for securely
creating temp files with scripts?  Nope, no mktemp.

I hear Solaris 10 is better; I wouldn't know--I did an installation in a
VM and, despite having selected the GNOME desktop, I was unable to login
via X because one of the required GNOME libraries hadn't gotten
installed.  Duh.  I'd planned to fix that, but that was probably 6
months ago.

NFS sucks; long live NFS.  I haven't mucked with NFSv4 much; my home
directory NFS server at home is still running a 2.4 kernel.  At work, I
limit NFS use to temporary mount points--installation sources (would you
believe that very little of the software we get from IBM actually comes
packaged as an LPP, which makes it impossible to install via NIM?),
database dumps for loading on other systems, etc.  Yes, Linux's
automounter sucks too; I'll give you that.  But Solaris lacks software
RAID and LVM support that can actually be used with the basic system
filesystem.

> True! But I do try to filter those instances out. A kernel panic is a

The only kernel panics I've had with Linux in the last few years were
due to me using non-mainline stuff--like the NVidia and VMware drivers
and trying to rmmod the OpenAFS kernel module.  The ones from farther
back that I can remember were usually due to bad memory and other
hardware errors.

The glass around the electron gun ("the neck") is thin compared to the
faceplate, which must be thick for safety, radiation, and mechanical
stability reasons.  The neck glass is thinner partly to place the
deflection yoke closer to the electron beam, but the main reason is
that consumers aren't normally exposed to it;  better to put extra
glass in the faceplate rather than the neck.  The weakest place is
the evacuation stem in the center of the pins, and breaking that is
pretty safe.  But the glass weld from the neck to the bell of the CRT
is weak and under high stress, and thicker glass just makes it worse
(more cooling mismatch after the weld).  This is typically where a
CRT breaks, and breaking throws very sharp shards.  Most go inwards,
but the mechanics of chaotic rapid fracturing will send some of the
shards in all directions.

When the monitor case is intact, the user is protected from the weld
by the yoke, the electronics assemblies to the side, and the outer
case.  While it is unlikely that the glass at the weld will shatter,
it can and does, and I have broken CRTs this way.  I used to work
at Tektronix, where they made CRTs, and have seen the safety and
slow-motion testing movies, and had friends in the engineering glass
shop who made CRTs.  The back side of a CRT is not as dangerous as
dynamite, probably no more dangerous than an M80 wrapped in broken
glass, but that can still lacerate or blind you.  Personally, when I
work inside monitors I risk hand wounds (they heal), but I NEVER work
with the case off without full-enclosure eye protection.  This is
reality, not a game, and you can't start over if killed or maimed.

Elliott, you may like CRT monitors a lot, but when you clean one,
don't risk a Darwin award attempting to prove your invulnerability.
CRTs in dusty places need to be cleaned for safety reasons - so do
desktop PC power supplies.  Some people here may not have the money
to get their CRT monitors cleaned professionally, and I would not
want their maiming to be on my conscience.  YMMV, of course.

Vim comes with Solaris 10 now, if you must have it. Bash/csh/tcsh has
for years.

Ok, I'll just focus on Solaris, because you know more about AIX than I do :)
SMF in Solaris 10.. there's no more rc.* scripts.

lsof exists in S10 now I think(??), but there was always the p-utils.
(pfiles, etc)

Thanks for bringing it up. Yes, it does :)

What?! This is mainly why I responded again...
Solaris has had SVM for a long time, which is functionally equivalent to
LVM. I feel it's easier to manage, but opinions vary. More to the point,
Linux can't do filesystem snapshots!
(Of course: ZFS++ but we're talking about something different here)

Hello Group,



I am new with Suse and new with this group too. My boss just told me I need

fine. I configured to allow only SSH on firewall and it is wide open. My

only ( 192.9.1.0 - 192.9.1.20 and all 187.4.*.*), How do I do that?
SuSEfirewall2/iptables installed. I wasted my 3 days googled here and

And some folks prefer to call it "SunOS 5.#" because that is what
`unamr -sr` reports. As such that is what you test for in scripts.

I like CRTs for display. I said nothing of liking cleaning them. Even
without the reminder I wouldn't try it. Thanks for the reminder of why
though.

Jenifer,

You are using hardware RAID. You can go into the Smart Array  
utilities at boot to see how they are mirrored, but the default for  
those servers with two disks I think is to mirror them. Thats why you  
are only seeing one disk. Its a mirrored hardware array.

   If the few others here who run Slackware would like a package for
SQLite3-3.3.12, I built one using a SlackBuild script. It comes with the
.md5 sum for integrity checking.

   Ask and ye shall receive.

Yes, the GNU userland is perhaps the best there is. Yes, the Solaris kernel 
has a lot going for it, especially lately with things like ZFS.

Fortunately, we can eat our cake, have it too, and then live happily ever 
after with Nexenta:

It's not quite ready for primetime yet, their package selection is still a 
ways away from having all of Ubuntu's, but it's still pretty good.

I think stuff like that is awesome to watch, but I get mad now when 
people touch my screen.  I will be cleaning the screen all the time now? 
  And I look at my keyboard and mouse and all the really shiny keys and 
spots where my fingers and hands touch the most.  I think a screen will 
get "finger burn" in common areas quickly.  There, you heard it from he 
first.  The new term Finger-Burn (TM).

But here's a cooler one anyway, cause it's bigger. :)

Apologies in advance for bringing up the "W" word.

Does anyone know how to get the "Guest" account on a Win-XP system to access
a remote filesystem?

The remote filesystem in question is a Linux/Samba box.

The Win-XP "Admin" account can see and access the remote files just fine.

The Win-XP "Guest" account can see the local net under "Microsoft Windows
Network" but cannot see the systems.

All my searching has failed to uncover any useful information so far.

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

      Most system users and administrators aren't security experts
      and don't want to be; but they have to deal with security
      in order to get other things done.  And they have to do this
      within very tight budgets for both in terms of time and money.

      David Mandel fits this situation.

      He has had a number of systems invaded over the years including
      two in the last year.  David will describe a number of techniques
      he uses and/or recommends to protect systems and data on
      the systems; and where these techniques have worked and where
      they have failed.  He will also discuss tools that have proven
      useful in examining invasions and repairing the damage.

      *******************************************************************

          Agenda:

              7:00 - 7:30  Business
                   We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects

I had the same thought when I first saw an online demo of this a month
or two ago. I guess LCDs are going to have to come with a layer of
glass on top. Otherwise by the end of the first day of use the screen
will be so scratched that you won't be able to see anything.

I don't know what that dude's job is, but I don't want it. Evidently he
has to stand all day long in front of a wall to do his work. Makes my
feet ache just thinking about it. 

Besides, what I really want is to be able to tell the computer "enlarge
the image of Manhattan 200%" and have the computer just do it. "Now
move it to the far right of the screen." "No, wait, just delete it."
"Get all the images by Gaud? available online." And so on.

And I want to do it sitting down with a beer next to me.

On a more serious note, I might go for the idea of the rotating cube
for the various workspaces. But my computer doesn't have a touch
screen. Can I make it rotate just with the mouse?

Having recently upgraded to Edgy and reinstalled ndiswrapper (always

distribution. Therefore, it was necessary to screw it up so it no

As a result I found a little applet called wifi-radar that works even
better than the old built in System > Administration > Networking GUI
window. By "better" I mean it launches instantly, finds available
wireless networks in seconds, and connects to the one I choose in a few
seconds more. The now-broken GUI used to make me stare at an hourglass
for several minutes to do the same thing.

However, like the old GUI, wifi-radar requires root login to launch it.
Now, I have always had to do that with the old system too, so that is
nothing new. However, it got me thinking about this issue. Like, why?

Consider that upon booting the computer, eth0, the wired network
connection, is readily available to anyone without additional root
login. So anyone who can log into the computer can just hook up an RJ45
cable and proceed to download all my secrets. OK, I don't have any
secrets on this computer, but the point is that there is no real
security other than the need to know my username and password to log in
after booting. So evidently Ubuntu thinks that access to eth0 should be
granted to anyone who can log in. Then why not access to wlan0? What's
the diff?

Wifi-radar comes with instructions for using PAM to launch it as a
normal user. I don't know what PAM is, but I can probably figure it out
and follow the instructions. But before I go to the trouble, does my
logic make sense?

PAM - pluggable authentication modules.  It provides an interface for
authentication to programs.

What do they ask you to do?

I have never run WinXP, but I am guessing that Win2K is similar.
I have Win2K running under VMware (a licensed copy, BSA code cops!)
and talking to the Linux host with Samba.  I had a problem like yours.

I suspect you have not entered the appropriate name/password combination
for the guest account into the remote system's samba password file. 
Read the man page for "smbpasswd" on the remote system. 

If that doesn't work, then I have no idea.  I don't run spyware-by-design
operating systems like WinXP and Win2K3.  You should ask Microsoft, since
they know what you are doing and are sniggering at your missteps now. :-/

So that no password is required.. here's an example:

Yes. In Beryl (compiz probably as well) ctl + alt + mouse click you can drag
the cube in all directions.. you can also go to the top of the cube and
rotate it then down to the other desktops with only the keyboard in Beryl
with ctl + alt + arrow keys.. but it doesn't go 3D with the complete nicey
nice rotation..

What's interesting as well is that the cube is thought of as one desktop. A
desktop with 4 usable sides (workspaces) and a top in the bottom. Add a
desktop in the configuration you end up with two separate desktops which are
each their own cube of 4 workspaces.

You threw me for a bit, but then I noticed the "onyx" in your prompt
and tried ssh'ing to it from my virtual server.  That worked.
Apparently a standard shell account is included in the price of "Web
hosting".  So I've set mutt up there to fetch my mail via pop (no
imap...), and as far as I can tell everything works.  I'm posting this
from there now.

The shell account machines are pretty similar to the virtual servers,
only with lots more software installed, so I was able to compile a cgi
app there and move it over to be hosted.  My most demanding cgi is a
dictionary compressor for my handheld FOSS word game (see .sig), and
hosted on SpiritOne execution time's dropped from ~15 seconds to
instantaneous (as experienced by a user.)  So I'm one happy camper.

Thanks to everybody who pointed me at these guys.

I don't remember where I found it, but if you're interested, a Google 
search should turn it up -- there is actually a QEMU machine image of 
the OLPC you can "boot" and run in QEMU, and there are directions for 
making a VMware-compatible virtual machine image as well. It's been on 
my todo list to hunt it down and get it going, but I haven't had a chance.

There is a great service menu for Konq called KIM. Go to kde-apps.org and 
search for "kim" 

It is very handy for resizing and batch resizing of images.

The environment in which it ran.  That is, the $PATH or equivalent may
be different between the context in which your mid-night cron job ran,
and the context in which you ran it manually.  That seems the most
likely explanation.

You're right; SVM (nee Solstice Disk Suite) can actually be used with /
and /usr; I don't know if it's new or if I just never found it before:

http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-4520/6manpiejm?a=view

I concede that Solaris has improved (finally) to the point of being
useful.  You still have not established that "Linux is horribly

Russell,

   Oh! OK. The cron job calls the script, /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm. That
then invokes /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm. I tried invoking the latter directly.
But, why would this make Date::Calc not found in the @INC? Are those include
directories different based on how the application is called?

Many thanks,

Rich

LCD flat panels can be high resolution, but they aren't generally and
it's not because of any technological barrier.  Look at laptops,
1400x1050 or better in a  15.1 inch screen, yet try to get that in a
flat panel.  You'll either find you can't or that it is very expensive.
1280x1024 in 1 19" viewable 20" LCD panel is far less than what is
technologically possible.  I think the resolution of flat panels tends
to be low because companies are of the opinion that people are more
concerned about cost than they are about performance.  It is odd to me
though that the average laptop monitor is higher resolution than the
average flat screen.

discrepancy.

If I do whois robinson-west.com I get that the third nameserver is
ns2.opusnet.com which has an ip address of 209.210.200.3.

Now then, dnsreports.com tells me that the third dns server is at

I may have to contact my ISP and ask what's going on with that.

The eight-character "limit" in some versions of Solaris is imposed by 
the admin tool, not by the OS:

If you think that's braindead, try adding yourself to another group
while logged in using 'usermod':

# usermod -G other,httpd cooleyw
UX: usermod: ERROR: cooleyw is in use.  Cannot change it.

Of course, this is just Solaris 8; maybe Charlie will tell me it's been
made less braindead sometime in the twentieth century.

On Solaris 10, things seem more sane:

# usermod -G staff heinlein
UX: usermod: heinlein is currently logged in, some changes may not 
take effect until next login.

1) whois != DNS

2) your nameservers are glued to an IP in the TLD ns for your domain (in this 
case the TLD for .com). This is a 'glue record'.

3) when you register your NS servers you provide a name, but the TLD ns needs 
both name and IP for this glue. it gets the IP from the maintainer of the NS 
server, who has the authority to change it.

It seems like that might have happened. allthough strange, this happens from 
time to time if you use other peoples dns services.

$ dig -t NS robinson-west.com. @209.210.200.7

; <<>> DiG 9.3.3 <<>> -t NS robinson-west.com. @209.210.200.7
; (1 server found)
;; global options:  printcmd
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

that's _not_ good. but I don't see this IP in your dnsreport.com. perhaps they 
just changed something?

Oh yeah?

MySpace runs on 64-bit Windows, using experimental versions of 64-bit
SQL-Server!

Seriously, this article made me raise an eyebrow.  Yes it's MySpace,
which I don't use, and is buggy, and we could all come up with reasons
why it would be better running it on FOSS, but still.. impressive for a
Windows environment (would be an impressive design on a FOSS environment
for that matter).

http://www.cioinsight.com/article2/0,1540,2084842,00.asp

The presentation on the design of LiveJournal was interesting as well,
which is FOSS:

http://tinyurl.com/2nbxby (Google PDF -> HTML link)
http://www.danga.com/words/2004_mysqlcon/mysql-slides.pdf

Now that AMD has been punted from Sun, and Intel is pitching Solaris, I
need to formulate my "not if but when" plan for the Great Linux to
Solaris migration that everyone is going to be demanding here pretty
soon. ;)

Solaris wouldn't be where it is without the pressure from Linux (would
we even have FOSS Java?).  I say let them all live, and they will all
grow off each other (ZFS for Linux, please!).  GNU and GNU-like systems
allow skills to transfer.  A competitive market is great for us.  The
day AMD tanks is the day Intel stops innovating.

Plan9 forever!

Admintool? Usermod??

I agree that's braindead.. but I've never seen anyone use these tools.
If you aren't running NIS/LDAP, just edit the files.. (I seriously think
that's what Sun intends, given that it's faster). *shrug*

And anyone who has used Solaris expects that there aren't any tools 
anyway.

I use convert (included with ImageMagik) to create smaller images from
the ones I download from my camera. I happen to make 800 x 600 images,
but you could change the 800 to the larger dimension of the thumbnail
size you want and get the same thing.

In the directory where I've downloaded the images, I create a directory
named 800. Then I run the following shell script:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
for i in *jpg;
do
convert -size 800x800 -resize 800x800 $i 800/`basename $i .jpg`-800.jpg;
done
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that for the script to work, the extension on the image files has
to be jpg, and can't be JPG. If your camera doesn't have a setting for
lower case file names, you'll have to convert them yourself, first. If
that's a concern, let us know. Somewhere, I still have the notes that
told me the three step process for renaming a batch of files.

800x800 produces images that are either 800x600 or 600x800, depending on
which way I held the camera.


Also, see:

http://imagemagick.sourceforge.net/http/www/convert.html

for another example that describes making 120x120 thumbnails.

Subject: [PLUG] Command line genius needed
Message-ID: <20070130143621.c91093a6.johnxj@comcast.net>

I suspect a module or library or something that OOo 2.04 depends on is
either missing or messed up. I have come to this conclusion after
extensive querying the OOo e-list and forums, as well as the Ubuntu
forums, plus googling and searching everything I can find. 

The problem: Upgrading Dapper amd64 to Edgy amd64 also upgraded OOo
2.02 to 2.04. Everything works fine except drag and drop editing of
text; i.e., select a sentence in the middle of a paragraph and drag it
to the beginning of the paragraph. This has always worked fine since
forever with OOo, but now nothing happens. It just doesn't work at all.
No error messages, no crashes; just nothing happens. The only thing I
found was a post some months ago to an Ubuntu forum, and evidently it
affected only two people. No solution was ever posted. I queried the
two individuals privately and one responded that he never found a
solution. The problem affects only OOo; I can drag and drop text fine
in AbiWord, etc.

I'd go back to OOo 2.02, except with the Edgy repositories the only
version that appears in Synaptic is 2.04. In fact, I can't even find
2.02 on openoffice.org. I have reinstalled OOo 2.04 via Synaptic,
including all the individual components, but no change. However, there
are undoubtedly things that it uses and depends on that are not in the
open- alphabetical listing, so I would not see them. I searched all
over openoffice.org, but this information is apparently a state secret.
I am wondering if there is a way via the command line (or any other
way) to determine what libraries, modules and dependencies exist for a
program. Any other suggestions also welcome, of course.

ldd `which <binary>` will give you a list of all shared modules that any
given binary depends on.

Thanks!

Now I'm off to see if I can find a list of all the binaries that OOo uses.

I'm not super familiar with Ubuntu but it looks like the below should tell
you

dpkg -c <oo-version>.deb  ...

Hey Guys and Gals-
I've seen the recent traffic about ISP's/Webhosts and I'm just curious to
gather some information about what people want out of an ISP/Webhost ...
there is no slant here for me :-) I have a buddy who runs a successful ISP
in Southern California and is trying to break into the webhosting business
and not having much luck. Does it come down to pricing or core features for
most people?

Thanks for the feedback,

      Most system users and administrators aren't security experts
      and don't want to be; but they have to deal with security
      in order to get other things done.  And they have to do this
      within very tight budgets for both in terms of time and money.

      David Mandel fits this situation.

      He has had a number of systems invaded over the years including
      two in the last year.  David will describe a number of techniques
      he uses and/or recommends to protect systems and data on
      the systems; and where these techniques have worked and where
      they have failed.  He will also discuss tools that have proven
      useful in examining invasions and repairing the damage.

      *******************************************************************

          Agenda:

Attempting to conserve desk space in my wife's tiny office, about
a year ago I purchased a Shuttle ST62K micro-ATX computer.  It is
small and cute, but the fan has failed three times now (many clever
but futile fixes, long story) and the damned thing is just too
unreliable to maintain remotely.

Any recommendations for a reliable small form factor X86 system
to replace this P.O.S.?   It must be compatable with Linux,
needless to say, and I hope it can use the same CD and 5.25
hard drive and DIMMs as the old machine, so I can gut the
beast before sending it to freegeek for scrap.  It will need
either a DVI video connector, or a slot for a low-power DVI
video card.

Ah, you said "X86." Otherwise, I was going to suggest a PS3. :-)

Mac Mini?  No to the same CD, HD, and DIMMs, but even smaller,
x86-based, and power consumption lower than a laptop (mobile
CPU/chipset/memory/HD minus the display).  Mac Minis have DVI out and
AFAIK are reliable.  Expensive though.

All you need is to register for a free http://ekiga.net account and have 
a microphone and speakers... or a USB headset (e.g. Logitech 350).  I 
have found that the sound quality is not as good as skype, but it is 
open source!

You can also use it to call toll free numbers for free using a syntax 
of: sip:*1800________ at fwd.pulver.com in the dialing box.

You didn't really put a quantum bigfoot in a shuttle case, did you?  
Maybe that's a 3.5" drive?

Anyhow, the mac mini is certainly quiet, but afaik, hasn't got a bios 
(and good luck finding the hood latch.)

Aopen has a mini knock-off with (IIRC) an epia motherboard.  Not sure 
about reliability though.  Also, the price is not much below the mac 
mini, though I guess without the gigabit ethernet and bluetooth, etc.

Assuming you don't need huge processing power or extremely small 
footprint, you might look for a refurb ibm desktop.  I've got a P133, 
and of the boxen I've had from that era, it is the only one which is 
not yet flaky.  I opened it a while ago to dust it out (after 400 days 
uptime as a failover-only machine (before that, probably just as much 
uptime as the web+svn server)) and found that the front fan (which was 
still spinning fine, yet silently) had lost a blade.  Now, plastic 
should be expected to fail, but the fact that I heard not a peep of 
complaint from the bearings is a testament to the quality of such 
insignificant details (you know, the sort that mean the difference 
between flaky and not.)

   Thanks, John. I suppose that an inexpensive web camera would also be
worthwhile.

   Er, ... toll-free numbers don't cost us anything on the land-line, either.

I've been looking at the ASUS Terminator T1-C3 for my next 
low-power-with-disks machine.  It's a very well equipped barebones 
VIA C3 system that goes for < $80 at Newegg.  No DVI, but it does 
have a PCI slot.

I'd love to hear stories from anyone who has one.  I'm thinking 
about replacing my aging (and pita) Kurobox with one of these.

I have a suggestion though I have not used either of these myself yet.

Acer and HP have "book" form factor (as opposed to "lunch box" like the
shuttle and clones or Mac Mini) micro mini-tower systems.
They come in low end (Celeron) and mid-range (Core 2 Duo).  They use
Mini-ITX or some similar small form factor motherboard,
laptop size DDR, but desktop size (5.25) optical drive and (3.5) hard
drive.  The power supply is laptop brick style instead of inside the case.
Rather nice looking unit, but I can't speak for reliability.

HP:

As far as I can see the Acer has DVI out while the HP does not.

I will put in my $.02 about Shuttle stuff being sub-par.

With the "Boot Camp" firmware updates it has a legacy BIOS mode
allowing grub to work (or use rEFIt, grub2, or elilo???).

Apparently, the Minis are among the best of the Intel Macs at Linux.
It's just an Intel chipset, Intel video, etc. It has Atheros wireless,
so you'd need to do Madwifi or sort out something else there.

Subject: [PLUG] Laptop Recommendations
Message-ID: <eprnh8$qb4$1@sea.gmane.org>

Its time to retire my tired old Dell laptop, and I'm planning on 
replacing it with one running Linux.  If possible, I'd like to either 
get one that either doesn't have an OS installed and put Linux on it, or 
buy one that comes with Linux preloaded.

Web searching has shown me that Linux Certified (www.linuxcertified.com) 
has Lenovo laptops with Linux already loaded.

Has anyone had any experiences with this place?  Does anyone have any 
recommendations for an alternate?  Are there any laptops, or laptop 
manufacturers that you've had particularly good (or bad) experiences with?

Thanks.

Thumbs up to Lenovo. I've also had luck with Acer and HP. But the HP
required use of ndis-wrapper to get the wireless working whereas I could use
the Madwifi drivers on the Acer. My recommendation would be to look at the
hardware on the laptop and ensure it has an open source driver or a well
supported  commercial driver such as the one's that Nvidia releases.

lenovo is reasonbly good (t43, t60) and thinkwiki.org is an excellent non-distro 
specific resource for linux users on thinkpads. I haven't seen the equivalent 
yet for other brands. Please feel free to let me know if there are any :)

Cheers,

Auke

Subject: [PLUG] hard drive geometry...
Message-ID: <20070131000358.cmp371of408o4kwc@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Back around 1995 or so, we started to see geometry
translating hard drives.

I'm wondering why the registers that the old CHS standard
depended on weren't increased in size?  Where an 8 bit
register was used, replace that with a 16 bit register,
etcetera.

I've received a comment that the register size can't be changed
because: dos, Windows 95, and every other OS from that far back
will break.  Someone also decided to throw in anti Linux fud by
commenting that BSD is better because it isn't "cobbled" together
with third party software, mostly from GNU, but I'm digressing.

Doubling the size of the respective registers so that CHS will
still work today with our larger hard drives seems to me to be
a more straightforward solution.  I guess I don't see where the
software problems lie.  Is it the size of on processor registers
that are creating the: 16 heads, 1023 cylinders, 63 sectors
limitation?  Are these registers in memory?

Hard drive translation is extremely confusing to me.  I find
it a very hard topic to understand.  Maybe I just lack a good
explanation that I can follow.

Beyond hard drive geometry discussions, the idea that partition hiding
is a bad hack was proposed.  Is the idea of hiding fat partitions
really a hack?  I think there is a special partition type for hidden
fat.  XP and 2000, perhaps NT too, don't seem to honor hidden fat.

With Vista only running on machines that are less than a year old, Microsoft
could demand a change to the way hard drives are accessed on PC's.   
Microsoft doesn't have to worry about Vista being run on computers  
before the change
is made, because it won't run on them.  Sucking up processor power just
to impress me visually doesn't make an operating system better in my
opinion.  From what I've heard, it sounds like Microsoft likes the OEM
channel and that Vista will give OEM hell a whole new meaning.

Do Apple computers have far less legacy support than PCs in order to
keep them simple and theoretically produce a more stable platform?
