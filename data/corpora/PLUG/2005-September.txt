I am considering buying a ThinkPad T42 with the 14.1-inch 1400x1050
display, the IBM (not Intel) 802.11 a/b/g radio and bluetooth.

I want the 1400x1050 display because I've become spoiled by the one
I've had on the old Compaq Presario 1800T.  The a/b/g radio is to make
debugging easier for some community networking I am involved with.

According to the lenovo website, the machine I've spec'd is a 2378RRU,
around $1700.  Anyone here have experience with one of these or
similar, plus or minus?  I've already looked at Linux on Laptops.

We've got a T41; I don't know how (dis)similar it is to a T42. It's 
running CentOS 4 and a local madwifi build. So far, everything's 
great.

It's been my experience that while it may be against the TOS they don't
actually do anything about it unless you become a "problem".  To be
considered a "problem" seems to involve a blindfold and a dart board.
YMMV by whatever ISP your DSL is through however, a few of them like to
monetize any incoming bits.

I've been running ssh for years and haven't been told to stop by Comcast.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0509010918140.27820@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Several years ago, Linux Journal had a step-by-step guide to identifying
which /dev/sdaN was recognized as the inserted USB thumb drive, and how to
mount it. I cannot find it in my collection here nor on the LJ web site.

   It's been a long time since I used that drive, and I cannot mount it. I try
mount -t vfat /dev/sdaN /mnt/thumb
and I'm told that the SCSI device doesn't exist.

Pointers appreciated,

Rich

I've been using a T42p for about a month now, and I *love* it.  (This
is the 15" screen running 1600x1200 -- my actual modes is marked "T42"
but it seems to have the hardware specs of a T42p -- which is what I
ordered).  I've had two problems with it:  1) It consumes more power
than it should while asleep in linux (not a hardware issue, as this
does not happen in windows [1], I should also add that this is still a
slow drain, it probably takes about 24 -36 hours asleep to drain the
battery), and external video is garbled at the moment (I haven't tried
to fix this yet).

I'm running Ubuntu Hoary, and the installer actually ran completely
wirelessly -- no power or ethernet, yet it was a network install :) 
in a word, it was awesome :).  Initially, I installed xandros to
resize the existing XP partition, then blew away the single xandros
partition with Hoary.  It dual boots perfectly, and I didn't have to
give it any additional thought.

Having waxed poetic about Ubuntu.. I'll move on to the hardware :)

I get a useable 4+ hours on the 9-cell battery, and there is an
ultrabay slim battery that can be added as well, although I haven't
tried this.  Hibernation works perfectly (the power issue above is
only a problem with sleep).  Aside from the increased power drain,
sleep works great.  There was a problem with the screen not being
restored on wake-up, but that is documented here [2] and the fix is
simple (kernel boot param).

The fingerprint reader is not supported, nor is the hard-drive
protection system (althought there is work on the latter).

The lcd is absolutely amazing.  Colors are very rich even at wide
viewing angles.  I often fold the screen completely flat, and everyone
around a table can see what's going on (modulo glare from direct
lighting).

A track-pad and track point are provided for pointing devices -- with
the correct configuration (I haven't done this) you can tap the track
point to left-click, and there are three mouse buttons positioned for
your thumbs, above the trackpad.  Another two buttons are located
below the trackpad, for use there.  The pad itsself is positioned and
sized perfectly *between* your hands, rather than under the heel of
your right hand. (my iBook and inspirion both suffered from crappy
trackpad placement -- drove me mad.)

You can scroll with the right side of the trackpad, as is the common
deal these days, and the pad doesn't seem to react to light/shadows,
as some crappier track pads do (an issue on my iBook and inspirion,
again).

ACPI and APM both work, and can be used in concert, I think.  (not
sure why though, ACPI does everything I need at least.)  Events are
generated for: lid button, wifi toggle, screen blank, sleep,
hibernate, and probably others.  The screen brightness controlls
appear to be in hardware, or else they "just work" too.  there is an
led on top of the lcd that shines on the keyboard without causing any
glare on the screen.

The T42 does *not* have firewire, and it only has two usb ports.  If
you're familiar with T-series thinkpads, it has all the standard
features:  swappable cd/dvd drive, (and utlrabay slim, which limits
the options, but you can still get a couple different optical drives,
a second hard drive enclosure, or another battery in there).  The main
drive pops out the side after removing one screw and tugging on the
bracket.   The dock connector is not shuttered, which I was
dissapointed by.  I've set laptops in some sticky stuff before, and
without a cover over the connector I could see that capability being
ruined by such an event.

The laptop is also *fast*.  I don't have numbers, but there are people
who do,  I just haven't had any issues with performance at all (1.8
ghz, 1.25gigs cpu scaling works great too, btw.)

Lastly, Lonovo hasn't (yet) changed the quality of their products. 
For the time being, at least, thinkpads are still (IMHO) the best
laptops out there.

Ping me if you have specific questions, and I'll do what I can to answer them :)

The T series is a fairly solid line; I'm still using the T20 I bought a
few years ago.  A couple years after I bought the T20, we got 4 R32s and
we've had problems with all but one of them (and probably that was
because it was sold to someone who doesn't use it as heavily as we
have).  Skip the R series.

The Comcast Acceptable Use Policy[1] is a bit vague. You're not 
supposed to

   run programs, equipment, or servers from the Premises that provide
   network content or any other services to anyone outside of your
   Premises LAN (Local Area Network), also commonly referred to as
   public services or servers. Examples of prohibited services and
   servers include, but are not limited to, e-mail, Web hosting, file
   sharing, and proxy services and servers;

Ordinarily, I'd assume that a "Premises LAN" consists of machines, but 
the prohibition is against offering services to "anyone" (a person!) 
outside the LAN. This leads me to conclude Comcast primary considers a 
LAN a group of customers, not a physical collection of machines.

Which further leads me to conclude (or, perhaps, rationalize) that the 
prohibition isn't so much against services per se, but against 
services offered to people outside the local customer group, that is, 
folks who aren't members of your household.

So running sshd to allow you (a paying customer) remote shell access 
to your machine is probably just fine, while offering your friends 
(not paying customers) the same service is inviting trouble.

I'm sure the Comcast folks explicitly mention e-mail, Web hosting, et 
al. because those services are often made available to folks in the 
non-paying-customer category.

   I found the article: "Floppies for the New Millenium", in the December 2003
issue.

   Drivers are loaded, correct entries in /proc/bus/usb/ and /proc/scsi/scsi/.
It should mount with:
                       mount -t vfat /dev/sda /mnt/thumb
but I see these messages:

mount:  bad fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda,
         missing codepage, or other error.
         In some cases, useful info is found in syslog - try
         dmesg | tail or so.

So, I try the latter and see:

Current sd00:00: sns = 70  2

   Does this mean the USB thumb drive has gone bad?

   What do you suggest I do?

If there's no data that you want from the drive, I'd try formatting it.

If it won't format, then you know it's bad.

Colin,

   No data on it, I want to put a presentation on it to take to a meeting.

   When I try, 'mtools -f /dev/sda' I get a usage message. I guess this means
the tool died on me. Anything else I can try?

That should probably be "mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/thumb", since
you want to mount the partition, not the raw device.  The message
below is probably because of that.

Possibly, what happens if you run "fdisk -l /dev/sda"?  Is there a
partition table?  How about if you try it on a different machine?

Flash drives are more fragile than most people think, especially when
they are formatted with FAT32, which doesn't do a good job of
distributing the writes across the memory.

Also, I read somewhere that some flash devices have slow firmware that
takes a while to initialize, and a recent patch to the kernel added a
waiting timeout.  Dunno if that got into 2.6.13 or not.

Colin,

   Well, prices have certainly dropped since I bought this one. I think it's
(er, was) 128M and I paid about $70 for it a couple of years ago. ENU sells
that capacity for $18 now.

   Wish gasoline prices followed this pattern rather than the reverse.

Jason,

   I get different messages if I try a partition number:
mount: /dev/sda1 is not a valid block device.

I assume that is because your partition table on the device is
corrupted, so you don't have any partitions :-(

All the flash drives I've seen come with a single partition that fills
the whole device, formatted with FAT32, since Windoze can't understand
any of the filesystems that actually belong on a flash device (like
JFFS2).

Oh, and in case you're shopping for a new one, the Lexar brand ones
are still rated the most reliable AFAIK.  Good luck!

Although, reading the article you referenced from Linux Journal, it
appears that not all devices are like that, some actually do expect
you to mount the raw device (/dev/sda), so I stand corrected.

   Yeah, it needs a winduhs file system so I can use the laptop and projector
set up in the meeting room.

   Hmmm-m-m. ENU doesn't note the brands they carry, and Office Depot has PNY,
Memorex, and SunDisk. Guess I ought to see if I can find a brand comparison
somewhere.

   It is a 256M device that I have; bought at ENU.

Thanks,

I've seen some of these use partition 3.  Check:

  fdisk -l /dev/sda

And see if it has partitions.  If not, it should (cross fingers and 
don't blame me) partition just like any hard drive.

Um, no.  The "Premises" here is the street address at which the Comcast 
link terminates.  This clearly prohibits running any services whatsoever 
that are accessible outside the Premises LAN (the network on which the 
Comcast link terminates and which is contained within the one street 
address).

So your conclusion is, in fact, mere rationalization.  This is a per se 
prohibition on services.  The choice of the word "anyone" is unfortunate, 
but not wholly inaccurate since ultimately all services are provided to 
people.

Unenforcably, this AUP also claims to prohibit running services (programs 
or equipment) that are accessible to any neighbors on the LAN if this 
extends beyond the Premises whether or not those services use the Comcast 
link.  Of course, that's based entirely on this one section of the AUP as 
I haven't read the whole thing.

I'm not sure that's an entirely accurate parsing... the phrase 'Premises
LAN' seems to indicate that there are two components involved:
1) The Premises itself
2) The LAN found at the premises

Thus, running a file server, which a local LAN user could access while
sitting in front of their house (on a wireless link) would be allowed.
However, a longer distance pringles wireless link would probably be
considered outside of the scope of a normal LAN.

I guess I would argue that the LAN is the boundary, not the physical
street address. If you have an ethernet cable that runs 10 feet onto
the sidewalk in front of your premises, they don't really care about
that.... there's no MAN or WAN links involved in such a case.

I think we're both talking about the same issue, here.... but the intent
seems to be that traffic which transverses the LAN, *and* is served to the
internet at large, is prohibited, but internal LAN servers and services
are allowed.

I suppose it comes down to how one reads "Premises LAN", and how that is
defined within the document itself, no?

Ok guys, I got a small issue here and I'm wondering if anybody else has 
run into it yet OR knows how to solve it.

On my dual boot laptop (SUSE/WIN XP)  I'm quite often hooked up to the 
internet.

This isn't a big deal except I need to have access to all my E-Mails no 
matter the OS.
Even when I'm not hooked up to the internet.
(This would exclude installing an IMAP server on another computer.)

Right now I'm running Thunderbird on both sides.
Anybody have any ideas?

Does any one know any fixed wireless service providers in the Porltand
Metro area?  A client is using an Integra T1 Internet connection and is
heavily dependent on outbound Internet connectivity.  

I'm looking for an second Internet connection independent of Telco
cabling, so when the cable-seeking backhoe gets lucky, a relatively
simple configuration change will keep the client connected to the
Internet.

Jason,

   That's the one I read among those found by a google search.

   However, ... Ed Sawicki to the rescue! The drive mounts when addressed as
/dev/sdb1. I forgot all about trying different drive numbers, but Ed's note

   My thanks to all of you, but especially Ed.

Right, maybe.

I'd argue that Comcast's technical policies and apparent lack of 
enforcement against users providing low-bandwidth servers suggest that 
the company's working definition of "internet at large" is more geared 
toward "who" (is the remote user a customer on the premesis in 
question?) than "where" (is the machine acting as a client of that 
server physically remote from the premesis in question?).

It would be relatively easy for Comcast to block inbound SYN packets 
on popular ports to support a strict policy of "no servers."

In fact, in my neighborhood, Comcast took over what was originally the 
@Home network. The @Home admins actively scanned for rogue NNTP 
servers and would shut down those accounts if the servers persisted. 
Nowadays, I don't see any scanning like that whatsoever.

Note that the drive will move around when you unplug it and/or reboot.  
Either setup a rule in /etc/udev/<something> or *always* 
tail /var/log/messages while you plug it in to make sure that you're 
trying to mount the correct drive.

I run a Suse 9.3/WinXP dual boot system, formatted with a large "D" 
drive for sharing.  To do what you want to do, move or copy the mail 
folder to the D drive. Then start thunderbird from the command line with 
the -p switch, and point your profile to the some_text.default file. 
Works for me.

Eric,

   Good advice. I use this device so infrequently I don't remember from one
time to the next how it's seen.

They could achieve very nearly the same thing by just listening for
the connections.  No need to try to initiate connections themselves if
others are doing it for them.

That is so true. Until recently, Qwest said my phone line didn't 
qualify for DSL. I don't know why it now qualifies, but I've been 
starting to investigate the option. I'd much rather send my ISP fees 
to a local firm like Spire or EasyStreet.

The trouble is, the US Supreme Court's FCC v. Brand X decision has 
seemingly given the FCC (and the Bush administration) the green light 
to deregulate DSL and remove line-sharing requirements.

My fear is that once Qwest is no longer legally bound to offer access 
to third-party ISPs, DSL will become as monolithic as cable. At this 
point, it's only a fear, but it's very tough to overestimate a 
monopoly's irrational drive for short-term profit.

Covad has a long-term contract that allows them to provide DSL over many
telco's copper. If you want a 3rd-party DSL service, check them out. 

One of my clients is a Covad reseller, so I've had some detailed
discussions with him about this. He's not worried about Covad shutting
down as a result of this (soon-to-be-overturned?) legislation.

I don't know of any local Covad resellers, but that doesn't mean they
don't exist.

You might check Stephouse (http://stephouse.net); I'm not sure about
long-haul wireless, but I know they do some wireless.  They've also been
supporting PTP, especially with the Mississippi project.  Disclaimer: my
buddy's been working there, so maybe I'm biased from he says.

   I just upgraded VMware Workstation from 4.5.2 to 5.0.0. The guest OS is
still the virtual win98. But, it doesn't see an e:\ drive, the smb share
which is /data2/winstuff on the host machine. I seem to go through this
hassle with every upgrade, but I have no saved e-mail messages with a
solution. And, the VMware help isn't any. There's something on the web site
about smb shares not automagically loaded any more, but I'm running a
'legacy' guest OS so I don't know if that applies.

   The guest OS has both bridged and host-only network connections to the host
machine.

   In the local "explorer" (i.e., file manager), I select the network icon,
then in Tools->Map Network Drive, I try to have it connect \\salmo\\winstuff
to e:\. It won't do it.

   A pointer from those of you who work in a heterogeneous environment would
be very helpful. It's the last step to being able to access my legacy data
files.

TIA,

Rich

Win4Lin isn't considered as elegant, but maybe it
doesn't have this problem. (In general, I don't do
this: I use multiboot when Windows functionality is required.)

   I have two major investments in VMware: the money for the upgrade and all
my data that's on the virtual drive.

Couple things:
1. Can you even ping the host's network interfaces, and/or anything
   on the network outside the host?  
2. Have you talked to VMWare support?  That's a large chunk of what
   you're paying for, after all.

Hi:

I just brought up Linux 2.6.11 kernel on a athlon64 dual core 3000+ box.
It is very fast.  Just curious if there is anything I need to do, like
tuning kernel parameters, in order to fully
utilize the dual core capability?

Aaron,

   Haven't tried. Don't know where to do this in the virtual win98.

   Er, no. It's past the 30 days and they won't talk to me. Sales helped by
sending me the proper serial number and I've posted on the vmware user forum
for workstation support.

   VMware is a great product, but their support model is that of Redmond and
does not win them any friends. I'd no longer recommend their product just
because they want to suck their clients dry for support.

Use an SMP kernel.  Use the -j4 flag with make when building stuff.
Encode MP3s while playing Quake.

I'd love to see the output of "cat /proc/cpuinfo"

You should be able to use "ipconfig" to see if you have a working
network interface, and "ping" to see if you can contact the guest's
IP address, the host's IP address and something outside the host, like
google.com.

I'll second this.  One of the worst support experiences of my life was
with VMware.  After several frustrating days trying to work out a
crash bug I was having with VMware, I tried to get the completely
clueless support drone to escalate to his manager.  He wouldn't.  He
offered to transfer me to another clueless support drone, but under no
circumstances could I have the problem escalated.

I finally had to write a note to the sales folks telling them what a
horrific time I'd had-- they managed to track down a really sharp guy
who almost immediately found the problem.  (It was me doing something
stupid.  Oops.)

I've recently been talking with VMware support again and they seem to
have cleaned up their act significantly.

My guess is they danced around a bit with offshoring and came back
when it was costing them business.

  -- Steve

PS: Rich, I found a possible solution and posted it to the VMware
board.  It applies to 4.5.2 but may also work for 5.0.  Basically,
turn off encrypted passwords in the Samba you'll be using, whether
VMware-provided or your own.

OK, I'm having data throughput problems.  I don't think I should, but 
maybe somebody knows better.  The motherboard is some Tyan Tiger model 
(don't recall which at the moment).  Dual Athlon MP 1.8GHz (whatever 
number designation that is).  1GB RAM.  No swap.

/dev/hdb -- 120GB IDE drive
jbrelin at person:~/school$ hdparm /dev/hdb

/dev/hdb:
  multcount    =  0 (off)
  IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
  unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
  using_dma    =  1 (on)
  keepsettings =  0 (off)
  readonly     =  0 (off)
  readahead    = 256 (on)
  geometry     = 65535/16/63, sectors = 240121728, start = 0


/dev/hdc -- DVD+-RW drive
jbrelin at person:~/school$ hdparm /dev/hdc

/dev/hdc:
  IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
  unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
  using_dma    =  1 (on)
  keepsettings =  0 (off)
  readonly     =  0 (off)
  readahead    = 256 (on)
  HDIO_GETGEO failed: Invalid argument

/dev/hdd -- DVD-ROM
/dev/hdd:
  IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
  unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
  using_dma    =  1 (on)

  readonly     =  0 (off)
  readahead    = 256 (on)
  HDIO_GETGEO failed: Invalid argument

/dev/sda -- 20 GB SCSI HD


OK, so I'm trying to write some DVDs.

Created an ISO in a fairly normal way (may as well be a big pile of 
zeroes, though).  Using growisofs to burn with
growisofs -Z /dev/hdc=file.iso

It chugs along for a while (varies wildly) and then the write speed drops 
to 0.0 for a while and the failure pops up.

Seems to me like some buffer is emptying, but you'd think if I shut 
everything else down and ran the thing from tty1, it'd do better.  It 
doesn't.

The few times it's appeared to work, the disks had some files that 
consistently could not be read from any drive (though most of the data can 
be read from any drive I tried).

What the hell am I missing?

My wife had this trouble just yesterday--she fixed it (she's my 'secret
weapon).

I'll forward this on to her... she'll be able to provide you with the
details. I'm sketchy on the details, but I know that she burned the
DVD's firmware. 

The key, I think, was modifying the "growisofs" command.

It's worthy of note that we found out a lot about squirelly DVD
manufacturers and the tricks the pull. DVD owners in the U.S, for
example--and again I'm sketchy on the details--should change their DVD
firmware from "Region 1" to "Region 2." The difference, as I recall, is
whether or not you have the ability to burn non-signed files or
something to that effect.

More on this as it becomes available.

Announcing... the Badger Badger Badger Tour!

  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BadgerBadgerBadgerTour

I will be travelling for a month and a half, criss-crossing the northern
hemisphere, to bring the world of Ubuntu to your doorstep. Expect
badgers,
mushrooms, schnaaaaaakes, an awful lot of Ubuntu CDs, and a healthy dose
of
madcap hijinks! If you would like to catch up with me during my journey,
add
your details to the wiki page, or reply to this email.

Where will I be?

 * Boston for the GNOME Summit
 * London to check out our office
 * Amsterdam for EuroOSCON
 * Milan for Smau e-Academy
 * Montreal for UbuntuBelowZero
 * (US tour surprise - see below!)
 * Mexico City for GULEV

So... What's the surprise? Well, I've left a big gap open in my
itinerary
for you to fill in! It's kinda like reality TV, but without the TV, and
with
a lot more airline food. Here's how it works:

Would you like me to visit your local LUG or Ubuntu LoCo Team? If you
live
in a US city with a major airport, and can arrange a venue and audience
on
one of these dates, you have the chance to rearrange my itinerary in
your
favour!

All you have to do is create a virtual petition of twenty supporters -
the
more creative the better. You could get twenty of your user group
members to
post their support on a mailing list thread... You could get twenty
friends
to blog about it... You could put up a photo of your LoCoTeam in a huge
Ubuntu circle... Or you could come up with something even cooler!

 * Send your entry to me, Jeff Waugh <jeff.waugh at ubuntu.com>

 * Submissions close September 30th. The first ones in will be the
easiest
   to award - get in quick!

 * Please include a link to your virtual petition, along with your
contact
   details (phone number, in particular)

Good luck, Ubunteros!

- Jeff

Thanks for your reply.

I spoke a bit too soon yesterday.  The system started having problems.
Kernel panic whenever I do scp (to copy files into the box) or do
several HTTP downloads at the same time.  I was using kernel version 
2.6.11smp

I am installing 2.4 smp kernel.

What version of what distribution are you using? We're bringing some 
new Opterons online in the next two weeks, so I'm interested in any 
gotchas...

The 16th would be the Advanced Topics meeting (3rd Wednesday, right?).

Not sure if Opteron is exactly the same as mine.
But here are the details:
   Asus A8N-E motherboard
   AMD64 DualCore Athlon64 3000+
   ATI x300 SE graphics card
   4 GB of memory

Let me know what you need to know.  The symptoms that I am seeing
is that any HEAVY network traffic will cause the kernel to panic.
One or two ssh or telnet sessions won't do it.  scp'ing several files
and http download'ing several files would cause the kernel to panic.

I was installing Fedora FC4_x86.

Can you tell me which linux distribution will be you installing on your 
opteron?

Subject: [PLUG] combination bootable Knoppix & FAT partition on USB Flash
	Drive
Message-ID: <864q92wmvj.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I'd like to make a bootable custom Knoppix (or Knoppix-like) system on
a USB Flash Drive (e.g. a 512mb or 1gig SanDisk Cruzer Mini) that also
contains a windows- and Knoppix-mountable FAT partition that Knoppix
(and windows) can write to.  I am looking for a minimal-footprint
Linux environment in which to run my data collection software, and
that allows collected files to be saved to stable media without
risking touching any precious hard disk data on their machines.

I've been googling around and found some pieces.  Anyone have
experience putting Knoppix on a USB Flash Drive or have any other good
pointers?

Thanks!

It's not that hard.  Back in December or so I put the SECURE (?) 
knoppix-like mini-CD distro on my 512MB USB stick.  It's just files 
sitting in a FAT32 filesystem.  As long as the kernel can read the 
filesystem the compressed data image sits on, you're good to go - be it 
iso9660 or fat32.  That part of the equation was relatively simple.

The more difficult tasks were getting a working bootloader and modifying 
the boot scripts to look for a USB stick instead of just a CD.  I fought 
and fought to get syslinux or isolinux to work on a USB stick (one of 
them advertised that as being possible at the time) but eventually gave 
up and used GRUB instead.  Google should be able to help you configure 
GRUB properly to work - it didn't install properly for me, forcing me to 
install it again from within the grub prompt booted off the USB stick.

The boot scripts in the little initrd-style filesystem need to be 
modified to load the USB storage drivers and to then check the proper 
/dev/sd? locations instead of checking the CD-ROM drive for the 
"knoppix" image.

I don't think I had to do anything else to get it working.....

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0509030852220.29671@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This is starting out as a weird weekend. When I checked mail this morning
there were no messages reporting the status of the tape backup and the
summary of the mail log. These have been present daily for a very long time.

   Nothing seems to have changed in /etc/cron.daily. However, the postfix
mail log summary script (/usr/local/bin/pflogsumm) will not run manually,
either. It cannot find the perl Date::Calc module, which does seem to have
gone missing. The error message is:

[root at salmo ~]# /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm 
Can't locate Date/Calc.pm in @INC (@INC contains:
/usr/lib/perl5/5.8.6/i486-linux /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.6
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.6/i486-linux /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.6

/usr/local/bin/pflogsumm line 362.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm line 362.

   Why it should suddenly disappear I've no clue.

   Then, when I check /var/log/, I find that all copies of cron, debug,
spooler, and syslog have 0 bytes. They rotate just fine, but no one's home.

   Of course, it's a holiday weekend, but this is quite unexpected. If you
have suggestions what I should check, please let me know.

TIA,

Rob,

   I believe that LJ had an article recently on several tiny linuxes that
could fit on a USB thumb. It had instructions for getting them working, too,
IIRC.

Did you maybe upgrade perl?  If so, your @INC might have changed.  Try a 

  find /usr/ -name 'Calc.pm'

It's also possible that your package manager decided that you didn't 
need it anymore (given that your program is in /usr/local/bin/, I'm 
guessing that it wouldn't know about the dependency.)  Or, you may have 
a corrupt disk.

Eric,

   Not since the move from Slackware-10.0 to -10.1.

>  find /usr/ -name 'Calc.pm'

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ locate Calc.pm
/usr/lib/perl5/5.8.6/Math/BigInt/Calc.pm

   It's been there all the time.

   Nothing's moved/changed for a few months now. The
/etc/cron.daily/1postfix.save has run daily until this morning. It fires at
4:00 am.

   Quite puzzling.

Size is not an issue here.  The cruzer mini I've got is a 1gig device,
bigger than a CD-ROM.  The only reason I'll be wanting to customize
the filesystem is to provide my own rather small applications, not to
save space per se.

I'm trying to get a cron job to load a browser page as a user multiple

I would use lynx or wget, but I need a browser with javascript to load

I'm working with:

#!/bin/sh
/usr/X11R6/bin/mozilla --display :0 http://www.somewebsite.com

and cron whines at me:

Please provide hints or blatant help.

Rob,

This is perl, v5.8.6 built for i486-linux

   Same as above.

Xvfb might be the answer.  We use it to run our megabloated tomcat app
on remote machines.  The app requires X resources for some reason.

The poor man's way for us to run the app on a remote machine is to run
it in a vnc session.  This allows the ability to disconnect from the
server without it being the wiser, since the X session remains alive and
well.  While our app can be started and run in an ssh shell, it cannot
be backgrounded, and the screen session in which we get the ssh shell to
the server cannot be detached, without the server dying.  I'm no expert
on this stuff (I'm not a sysadmin, I'm a code drone), but I do know we
solve the problem with Xvfb.  It looks like another way to keep an X
display session alive so an X-dependent app can have have an environment
to run in.

Since our servers do not run any X session other then the Xvfb one, the
sysadmins are at liberty to hardcode :0 into their scripts.  This does
not work on a workstation, where the user is likely to be running :0
already, and possibly others in the form of multiple graphical X
sessions and vnc sessions.  You need some dynamic way to find the next
available display.  If I find out how, I'll add a posting later.  I
think our scripts were actually fixed to remove the hardcodings.  I can
take a look.

Not strickly Linux so ignore as you see fit.

I just installed a new WinXP system ( for a company that would love to 
give up Windows but has applications with no alternatives ) with several 
_very_ legacy Win9x systems using SAMBA file shares and printers.

To get the WinXP system to use the shares I had to turn on encrypted 
passwords in SAMBA and now am having problems with the Win9x system 
getting to the printers.  The system keeps asking for a password.

This ring a bell for anyone?  Pointers, clue-stick, etc.

Since you are not logging into the system from a terminal, you do not
have permission to display on :0.  You will need to allow localhost to
use the display.  Use the xhost +localhost command to provide that
permission on the session the "owns" the display.

Look in /usr/share/doc/samba-3.0.10/registry directory for the proper
register entry to allow encrypted passwords on the Win9x.  This is
directory listing is from a FC3 distribution.  You version of samba and
distro may put it somewhere else.  Look for the registry hacks, though.

The only windows versions that do not support encrypted passwords are Win95 
pre-OSR2, NT 3.x, and NT 4 pre-SP3. So for most windozes it's not necessary 
to use the registry hacks.

You have to create user accounts on Win9x. Then windows automatically sends in 
the username of whoever is logged in, so all the user has to do is enter 
their Samba password.

I believe Windows caches the Samba password, "helpfully" relieving users of 
the tedium of typing it in every time. Which is such an obvious security hole 
I'm sure I don't need to go into the gory details. If I remember correctly, 
that is, it's been awhile since I adminned win9x on Samba domains. (sometimes 
the brain blocks out awful memories.)

Most of them are commercial products and most of them run only on

this. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before a halfway decent 
open-source "remote browser emulator" shows up; the UNIX/GNU community 
has had expect and dejagnu for years. Good luck with it.

I don't think links is AKA elinks - I'm pretty sure they're two 
different projects.  :-)

And http://www.brandonhutchinson.com/JavaScript_support_with_links.html 
implies that at least some fundamental JavaScript is available with links.

I finally managed to get a USB keyfob to boot last night at about 3am.
It turns out, only one of my avec-t?te boxes _will_ boot off of a
keyfob, an Intel D845 motherboard.  I eventually succeeded using a
DamnSmallLinux Live-CD which comes with a function to build a USB
keyfob, and actually as of dsl-1.4.iso (which I used) it had a
slightly broken linuxrc in its minirt24.gz mini-root filesystem.  Now
I'll have to go back and figure out what it is doing so I can
replicate it by hand in a different context.

Memorex media I got at Office Depot a year or two ago.  Several
machines I have won't boot off of them, or even see them apparently,
as in:

  # mount /cdrom
  mount: No medium found

It does mount in the box where I burned it.  I don't have any problem
with full-size CDR media burned from the same box.  I wonder what the
problem is.  Any clues/experience?  If the things were more reliable
(or if I fixed whatever problem I am having) they'd be a lot more

Carla,  I didn't even try the Win98 system to see if it was having

I've had just the opposite happen to me - I can read 'em (I use the 
business card sized CDs that hold 50MB) everywhere, a few months ago two 
of my CD-writers stopped recognizing writable media in them.

I haven't run in to a machine that won't read 'em - and I've used 'em on 
*many* different machines, including ~50 several-year-old Pentium 133's.

I've had similar issues with systems reading CD-RWs, both the mini and

Verilan may provide what you are looking for.  I spoke with a sales rep
when bidding a project about a year ago.  A caveat: it was difficult
arranging a meeting with a technician to discuss esoteric points about
the installation that the sales person could not answer.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0509050722510.4439@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have apparently done something bad to my mail system, and I cannot figure
out what I did despite trying for the past two days. I've had no mail in my
INBOX since Friday. No spam that slipped past the filters, no reports on
backup results or the pflogsumm report from /var/log/maillog, no duplicates
sent in response to mail list messages. Mail from various mail lists are
placed in the proper files by procmail, but nothing comes into the inbox.

   This all started, I think, when I tried to modify procmail recipes to
direct moderately high volume mail lists into the appropriate file rather
than /var/spool/mail/rshepard. Nothing from those mail lists has shown up
since Friday, either. I've tried changing the order of recipes, but something
broke, either inadvertently by me or for some other reason. I need to find
the source of this problem and fix it, and I need help doing so.

   I asked on the mailhelp list about the lack of MTA log analysis, and the
sudden inability for /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm to run, but I've not received
help to a solution there.

   How do I go about trouble shooting this problem?

TIA,

Rich

Do you have something similar to the following at the beginning of your
.procmailrc file?

MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail
LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/log

That will create a log file in your $MAILDIR directory that indicates
what procmail is doing with incoming messages.

Also, do you have something like this:

DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/inbox

That will dump anything that isn't matched by your recipies into the
mail file by that name.

Stafford,

   I just tracked down the problem by approaching it from a different
direction. Yes, it was my error in the procmail recipes file that did it.
It's now all fixed, and I found the spurious file into which everything --
including those that should have fallen through to the default, my INBOX --
was placed. I've finished processing those 125 messages from last Friday
through this morning.

   Sorry for the static on a holiday weekend.

Subject: [PLUG] That's It! Nautilus is HISTORY!
Message-ID: <431CCBBA.13175.A64516F6@localhost>

I just lost about 15 Gb of files. Permanently gone. This happened 
while trying to burn them to a DVD for backup. Yes, there is no 
backup.

Originally I selected the whole folder (about 20 Gb.). But Nautilus 
does not tell you how many bytes the folder is unless you select 
all the files. Not knowing how many there were, I dragged them all 
to a burn window. When I tried to burn a DVD it did not tell me that 
there were too many files to fit. No, the stupid thing said there was 
no DVD in the drive. What it was trying to tell me was that there 
was not a DVD capable of holding 20 Gb in the drive. But the only 
error message it knows is "No disk in drive."

So after removing and replacing the blank DVD various times I 
decided to use a CDR instead, and this time I knew it couldn't hold 
all the files, so I selected just 600 Mb of them in the burn window. 
But once again, I got the error message. Turns out that whatever is 
in the burn window is what it wants to burn. Never mind that you 
have selected only some of them.

OK, have to remove the others from the burn window. But from past 
experience, this is very dangerous. You see, it did not occur to the 
Nautilus programmers that it would be useful to show different 
icons for file vs. shortcut to file. In other words, there is no way to 
tell whether you are deleting the file, or a shortcut to it. 

After thinking about this for a bit I decided I'd drag the extra files 
back to the original folder. This, I reasoned, would generate an error 
message if what was in the burn window was really a copy of the 
file instead of just a shortcut to it.

And it did, indeed, generate the error message. Fine. "I'll just 
cancel this operation then," I thought. Except the programmers 
forgot to put a cancel button on the error message box. So I tried 
hitting the X in the corner of the box, but it was grayed out. So 
were the Xs in the windows for the burn window and the original 
folder window. And the only buttons on the error message window 
were Skip, Overwrite, and Overwrite All. So I clicked on Skip. And 
it skipped the file. But there were 301 files. Looked like I'd have to 
click on Skip 301 times. They also forgot to put in a button for Skip 
All. So I decided, "if these are just copies of the files, let it go 
ahead and overwrite them -- won't make any difference." So I 
clicked on Overwrite All. And guess what effing Nautilus proceeded 
to do? It overwrote 301 files with NADA. They all disappeared. 
They're not in the Trash, they are nowhere. Gone. Just plain gone. 

This is a Very Bad Bug. 

I have to manipulate files constantly on this computer and the 
command line is just too time consuming. Seldom do I need to 
move files with something in common so I can use wildcards. 
Usually I want just "this file" and "that file" and "that other file" and 
so on. Too much typing to do it from the command line. I really 
depend on a GUI file browser.

Tonight's exercise has be so furious that if I can't get a decent file 
browser that actually works reliably and has a user interface that 
has actually been thought out, I swear I'm gonna unsubscribe, wipe 
out Linux, and install Windows 2000. I just lost four days work. I've 
HAD IT.

And save the pontificating. "You should have been making backups 
as you went along" is not going to make me feel any better about 
an OS whose users think it's OK to have a file browser that 
crashes several times a day and destroys files.

You have my genuine sympathies. You are right- that is poor design. Personally 
I think Gnome and Nautilus are poo, and get poo-er with each new iteration. 
Which doesn't help you, but at least you have one person agreeing with you!

You can probably recover the data. I don't know much about how to do this, I 
would start with utilities specific to your filesystem.

There are better programs for doing what you want to do; just holler when 
you're ready to hear some suggestions.

John,

   Have you looked at 'mc'? Midnight Commander is a console tool based on the
ol' DOS Xtree. The times I've used it rather than just the command line, it
has worked flawlessly for me. It knows files and directories and you see
exactly with what you're dealing.

   Regardless, if W2K seems a better OS to you, by all means use that which
makes you comfortable.

You have my sympathies as well.  I have no love for Nautilus, for many reasons.

While I personally like the command line, I've head that the Rox Filer
is very cool.

   John can add my support, too.

   While I _much_ prefer the command line, there are a few GUI applications
that have become indespensible. One of the most powerful aspects of linux
over anything Microsoft offers is choice. Sometimes it seems that there's too
much choice.

   IMO, both KDE and Gnome try to replicate the look and feel of Windous. This
is, for me, a total turn-off. There are so many alternatives to those two
that it can sometimes be difficult to choose.

   I've been using Xfce for years: lightweight, fast, does everything I need.
But, that's only my preference and YMMV. There are abundant tools, too, for
working with groups of files at one time. Take a couple of deep breaths,
John, and look at them. There's plenty of willing help here, but anger and
frustration are reasonable responses when something breaks Big Time and
you're not aware of what to do about it.

   As an aside, I had that sinking feeling this morning when I tried to
upgrade the postfix package here. It was only after upgrading -- and seeing
all the error messages -- that I discovered that the default download
requires mysql. I don't need or want mysql; my mail system needs no database
backend at all. So, several minutes of reading messages in the package forum
left last July showed me where to go to get cyrus-sasl and postfix packages
built without mysql support because others had asked for that, too.
Obviously, I'm back to having a working mail system -- upgraded to 2.2.5.
But, how do you ask for help from the community when the mail isn't working?
_That's_ a conundrum.

   Your file problem can almost certainly be fixed. Let's take it one step at
a time.

Message-ID: <20050906142341.59801.qmail@web52611.mail.yahoo.com>

A couple years ago, I got a motherboard with an Nforce chipset, but was
unable to get the onboard NIC to work for lack of driver support. Since
then I have stuck with motherboards with VIA chipsets.

I'm wondering if things have improved with Nforce on Linux. What has
been everyones' experience recently with Nforce?

When using the special, uber regex `^TO_', don't use the colon,

Travis,

   Sonofagun! I never knew this. It works the other way with other recipes,
but I'll try this, too.

Rox-filer is great. 

For burning CDs and DVDs, K3b is a really nice program, though it requires a 
KDE base install. X-CD-Roast and Gnomebaker are also good.

Wow, I feel for you man.  I hope you can get your data back, you
probably want to look into one of the computer forensics toolkits. 
Try not to do anything with the partition your data was on until you
can get the files back, if possible, the less you do with it the more
likely you'll be able to "undelete" them.

I would REALLY like to encourage you to (when you're feeling calm, but
not too calm) take your story to Ubuntu, or perhaps the Nautilus guys
directly.  This is the kind of stuff they really need (and want!) to
hear.  File a bug, spam a mailing list, whatever, but make sure
someone hears about this (besides PLUG :-), and you might be surprised
by what you find in the next version of Nautilus.

I managed to get my SCSI devices to be detected on Mandriva
LE2005.  The trick was th reinstall.  The BusLogic card was not
in the system the first time I installed.  After a reinstall
everything on the SCSI card's buss is detected.  This is on
my Athlon, ABIT system.  Next I'll try my Celeron, Intel mobo
system.

NVidia releases a binary driver for their Ethernet chip. There is also an 
open-source driver, forcedeth, but it did not work for me.

NVidia also includes OSS driver for their audio chips, but ALSA supports 
them as well. It's just a regular ALC850 chip. 

NVidia IDE is supported by the regular IDE driver, and NVidia SATA is 
supported by sata_nv which is included in 2.6 kernels and newer 2.4 kernels.

Some vendors add more hardware to their boards, my Asus board has a second 
NIC (Marvell chip, supported by sk98lin) and a second SATA controller 
(Silicon Magic, sata_sil).

My laptop has some variant of an Nforce3 chipset on it, but it uses
the Realtek 10/100 NIC (8139too driver).  As usual, the Broadcom
wireless only works with ndiswrapper.

Also, it is my understanding that portions of the Nforce4 chipset
definitely do not work, and will never work, under Linux, such as the
SATA drive with NCQ support.

  He should check out Logitel in Vancouver.  They're building VoIP
gateway appliances using Asterisk.  Neat stuff!

Message-ID: <BAY108-F351780E94E711011AEC7E5B8A70@phx.gbl>

Hi:

I am on kernel 2.4.21-32 and wish to upgrade to 2.6.12 or 13.  I did a 
kernel config
and compile the kernel.  Upon reboot, I picked 2.6.12,
it loaded several things and finally gave me a bunch of error messages:

   insmod exit abnormally
   insmod: QM_MODULES: Function not implemented.

Could anyone tell me how I can fix this error?
thanks

You need to get module-init-tools, as the module loading/unloading
tools changed between 2.4 kernels and 2.6 kernels.  You should be able
to install the new version and it will work backwards compatible with
your 2.4 kernel, if you need to keep it around.

Actually, you have to be a little bit careful when you install the new
tools if you want to be switching back and forth between 2.4 and 2.6.

Look at:

module-init-tools changed from 2.4 to 2.6.  You need to upgrade
module-init-tools.  This package contains such favorites as insmod,
lsmod, modprobe, rmmod, etc.

Relax and have some beer.
It's easier but counter productive to blame everything else 
except your own stupidity.

Travis,

   This works, thank you very much. With other mail lists, the colon, dot, and
splat work just fine. Regardless, I'm not going to worry about this, but
accept that it's fixed.

   I also fixed a problem with the wxPython mail list: it turns out that folks
send messages to it via both lists.wxwidgets.org and lists.wxwindows.org. It
took me a while to realize this.

Now on to the next challenge,

Rich

Sure; you can change the record separator in Awk and count the records:

awk -v RS='' 'END { print "Paragraphs:", FNR }' filename.txt

(See the man page for RS='' instead of RS='\n\n'.)

AIX's grep has a paragraph mode, which is useful not only for text but
also finding relevant stanzas in configuration files and utility output.
With the above technique, you can achieve the same result.

Remember, of course, that "awk '/FOO/'" is basically the same as 'grep
FOO' (the record-print is implicit without another action). So you can
apply the same trick:

awk -v RS='' '/FOO/'

and find paragraphs with "FOO".  Unfortunately, the paragraphs
themselves are broken with this, so you can add them back in with:

awk -v RS='' '/FOO/ {print $0, "\n"}'

Rich Shepard mentioned 'mc' which also has an 'undelete' feature you
might be interested in checking out.

A few years ago, I ran into some bug in gqview which deleted about
half my hard drive until I killed the process.  I wasn't ever able to
reproduce the error (in a controlled environment, obviously), so I
don't know what went wrong.  Anyway, I shut off the computer and
mounted the hard drive on a different machine and used mc's undelete
function to recover almost all of the files that had been lost.  This
was on an ext3 filesystem.  I don't know what filesystem you're using;
if you don't know either, it's probably ext3.

Anyway, before you do anything else to your hard drive (like
reformatting it and installing Windows), you might want to have a look
at 'mc' to see if you can recover your data.  To be safe, I would take
out the drive and mount it from another host before installing any new
software on it.

   Thanks, Wil. I thought that awk, sed, grep or their derivatives would be
the way to go.

   Thanks, Nick! I totally forgot about that because I use the tool so
infrequently.

   I believe that Midnight Commander is in every distribution. A simple
'locate mc' would find it for James.

The best advice I've read so far.  :-)

Hang in there... we've all done it (deleted a bunch of files
accidentally) before and have lived to tell about it!

Perhaps we should all share our "root oops" stories or something to make
the new guy feel better?  :-)

If you check /etc/fstab is will indicate what the default file system
is.

I *love* my nForce-based systems.  If you don't mind using a recent
(2.6.8+ I'd say) kernel, everything should work OOTB.  Forcedeth has
worked quite well for me.  Audio works fine with the i8x0 driver.  IDE
works great.  Integrated video works as long as I set it in the BIOS to
use as much of the RAM as I can (setting it to 16MB causes the nVidia
drivers to not work properly - then again, this was a few years ago...)

What if somebody CC's the mailing list?  I've found filtering on the
Return-Path header to be most effective for dealing with mailing list
posts... regardless of the mailing list software used on the other end.

Take it or leave it, my two cents is on the table!  :-)

What's the name of the dude who did the * presentation a year or three

Then conjunct in additional rules to the one above.  For example:

:0:
* ^TO_matplotlib-users at lists.sourceforge.net
* ! ^TO_me at mydomain.com
programming

Something like this maybe?

:0:
* ^TO_matplotlib-users at lists.sourceforge.net
* ! ^Return-Path:.*matplotlib.*@lists.sourceforge.net
inbox

I don't know about you, Rob, but I would prefer that any message CCed
to the list be put in the mailing list's box rather than my inbox.

If a paragraph is *exactly* two new line characters in a row, then a
less accurate way that is a little easier on the wrists would be to
just use grep like this: `grep -c ^$'.  For instance:

> man procmailrc | awk -v RS='' 'END { print "Paragraphs:", FNR }'
Paragraphs: 149
> echo -n "Paragraphs: "; man procmailrc | grep -c ^$
Paragraphs: 153

   OK. I'll start.

   One day, soon after I received my new Sony notebook from Emperor Linux, I
was doing some administrative work -- su'd to root -- and meant to type 'rm
-f usr/'. However, for reasons I need not mention, I was seriously distracted
and typed 'rm -f /usr'. Of course, I instantly recognized my error, but there
was nothing to do but wait until the entire filesystem was deleted. Sigh.

   Fortunately, the fine folks at Emperor Linux know that we mere mortals get
distracted and do foolish things by accident. They have a recovery partition
on the hard drive. One telephone call and a half-hour later and all was well
again.

   Then there was the time when I -- as a user -- meant to type 'rm -f .*~',
but the fickle finger of fate was too fast for my slow brain and I hit the
[Enter] key before the tilde. Do you know just how many dot-files you have in
_your_ home directory? Can you name them?

   In this case, a trip to the back office brought forth the last full backup
and a restore of all ~/.* fixed that up.

   These two instances are why I 1) backup every night (incrementally) and do
a full backup each Friday night and 2) always make an alias for rm so that it
asks me if I really want to do the deletion. Sometimes, being a touch typist
has its down side.

My funniest (and most educational) would definitely be when I was 
sitting at my wife's computer and trying to remove a file with a funny 
filename (maybe it started with '-'.)  I had typed "rm -rf" and had hit 
the backspace key before I remembered that she had one of those evil 
keyboards with the backwards L-shaped enter key!  Now I always put the 
-rf options to rm at the end after I type the filenames, but more 
importantly I have banned all evil keyboards.

I've had to rebuild my /home folder a couple of times because I wanted
to remove a lot of .doc files.  So I did 'rm * .doc' instead of 'rm
*.doc'.  Doh!

Ctrl-C is your friend.  Or even the power cord, if necessary.  

Any invocation of "rm -rf" includes two non-printing characters:
<pause> and <think>, before the <enter> key.

   Thanks, Travis. I don't understand the difference in the resulting counts,
but my immediate need is for a correct number. They're lists of potential
clients that I need to call as soon as I return from a business trip, and
eventually will be imported into my contact management system.

Thanks,

   Yes, it now does here. However, some of us need to learn by our own experience
before getting really cautious. Now, every time I type 'rm -f ...' I pause,
remove my hands from the keyboard, look, and think before pressing [Enter].
Yup. Once burned, twice shy.

I was once changing distributions from (Mandrake 6?) to some version
of slack, and in advance I had jotted some notes about my partition
table on a napkin, knowing that I would need this when I went to
format the drive. (I wanted to save /home, as well as another rather
large partition full of music.)  Since I was revamping the rest of my
partition table, I only noted the partitions I wanted to save:
/dev/hdc1 and /dev/hdc6. (note they were both on hdC).  Having written
that down, I instantly forgot it.

When it came time to partition with fdisk (I didn't know about cfdisk,
or perhaps it wasn't available.. anyhow, I didn't have an easy view of
the partition table / sizes while I was partitioning) I looked at my
napkin, and saw "Oh, home is /dev/hda1 and media is /dev/hda6".  as
the ink had bled a bit, and my hurried handwritting made the c's
connect, and obviously /dev/hdo wasn't an option.

The install finished, and I logged in to find that /home contained the
root file structure from a Mandrake 6 install, and /media was really
just my old /usr.   Close to 30 gigs toast (this was a good 5-6 years
ago), and all my current projects, cvs repositories, homework, and
hours on hours worth of configuration data.

I *almost* quit using linux, but eventually realized what had gone wrong.

The difference is that Wil's solution will correctly handle situations
where the number of blank lines between paragraphs is greater than
one.  Also, my quick and dirty solution counts the number of blanks
between paragraphs.  The actual number of paragraphs (even if only one
new line separates them) is one greater than the number of lines
separating them.  For example:

> echo -n "Paragraphs: " ; cat <<EOF | grep -c ^$ 
Test para

Test para 2

Test para 3


Test para 4


Test para 5

Test para 6
EOF
Paragraphs: 7
> cat <<EOF | awk -v RS='' 'END { print "Paragraphs:", FNR }'
Test para

Test para 2

Test para 3


Test para 4


Test para 5

Test para 6
EOF
Paragraphs: 6
> echo -n "Paragraphs: " ; cat <<EOF | grep -c ^$ Test para

Test para 2

Test para 3

Test para 4

Test para 5

Test para 6
EOF
Paragraphs: 5
> cat <<EOF | awk -v RS='' 'END { print "Paragraphs:", FN R }'
Test para

Test para 2

Test para 3

Test para 4

Test para 5

Test para 6
EOF
Paragraphs: 6

Ya, then Wil hooked ya up.  His solution is a good one.

Just as an aside, there will be a bunch of Biker Scum gathering at  
the Moon & Sixpence on NE 42nd, just north of Sandy, tonight. I have  
a box of almost 50 Ubuntu 5.04 and we will take a picture with us  
biker geeks holding the CDs in front of our scooters. If you ride a  
motorcycle or a scooter or if you just want a copy of Ubuntu to go  
with your beer, you can show up and be in the picture, too.

Just a thought.

Ah, an announcement in the grand PLUG tradition.  6:30, I believe.

And note that these particular Biker Scum are mostly techies, riding
everything from ratty old Hondas to shiny new BMWs.  If you're reading
this on PLUG and you have a scoot, you'd fit right in.

Back in 2001, I was given the wonderful opportunity to maintain 
a Legato backup infrastructure.

The main Solaris filer (about 1TB) was backed up to a Legato 
Networker server (Linux) with a 16 tape Jukebox attached.  
There were also about a dozen other Linux and HPUX boxes backed 
up to this Networker server.

At one point I needed to do a full restore of a Linux box.  I 
loaded the restore program and began a restore.

About 3/4 the way through I remembered that Legato used the 
model where you run the restore program _on the box you want to 
restore_ as it uses a pull model, not push.

Well.. now I had just overwritten the entire backup server with 
this one server's data, including the Networker files related 
to the backup system.  Poof!  There goes the entire database of 
data to tapes tables.  Now where did I leave that backup system 
to the backup system?

27 hours later, I was back to normal with no data or tape 
library loss.  I learned a lot about the inner workings of 
Legato that day.

Well, a long time ago I had just taken a job as a systems programmer  
in beautiful San Bernardino, armpit of the universe (I was living in  
Idyllwild and commuting). A large part of the job involved writing  
microcode for the Data General MV20000, which led to a number of very  
funny stories (not necessarily funny at the time, though). I won't go  
into the reasons why you had to use microcode to get any significant  
systems level work done, but suffice it to say that the MV series had  
4 special purpose 32 bit registers available to the compilers and  
macro assembler, while there were 16 general purpose 32 bit registers  
if you used microcode.

At any rate, I was writing a test suite to bang on the MUMPS compiler/ 
interpreter that I was working on and I was told by my manager not to  
mess with the development machine, since they were doing something  
there as well. So I log into the production machine to run my  
innocuous little test.

Except it wasn't that innocuous.

When the test routine to check the date function, which had to  
support both Gregorian and Julian dates, I just slammed the hardware  
timedate back to a couple thousand years ago and marched it forward.

Very shortly afterwards, there was a mob outside my office door with  
pitchforks and torches and tar and feathers. Seriously, there were  
probably over 20 people in the hall yelling for my head on a platter.

It seems that we had essentially replace MV/OS with our own  
customized MUMPS operating system (very funny stories around MUMPS,  
believe you me), which used the timedate function to stamp the  
virtual memory pages. When I whacked back timedate a couple thousand  
years, there were about 60 people trying to actually do real work on  
the machine. Many of them had not saved their work for *days* and it  
was all gone.

I no longer do any work on production machines, even if management  
tells me to. I can laugh at it now, but there were several people in  
danger of aneurisms and I think I suffered some hearing loss that day.

Peace,
-Ron

Message-ID: <864q8vo1fs.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


How do I tell what voltage my PCI bus runs at?  This is a Pentium
II-400MHz box, with an Intel 440?X chipset (lspci says 440BX/ZX/DX on
the bridge parts, it has an AGP slot if that is any help).  I am
pretty sure it is an ASUS motherboard, probably a P2B or maybe a P2L.

I am mulling a mini-PCI adapter board that is said to support only
3.3V PCI buses, and want to look before I leap.

TIA!

I believe (someone please correct me if I'm wrong) that if the shorter
section of the PCI connector is closer to the back/plate then it is
3.3V, whereas if the longer section of the connector is closer to the
back then it is 5V.

BTDT :-\  Now I protect dirs I care about by creating a `-i' file so

rm: remove regular empty file `that'? n

Of course, that still won't protect dot files...

Russell, you're a friendly, articulate, smart guy who's been posting
here for a long time, so I'm always surprised when you ask about
something that could be answered by tinkering, perusing the
motherboard's manual or Searching The Fine Web.

I Googled for "PCI 5V 3.3V" and got a nice answer or two without
making use of the time, attention and good-will of the couple-hundered
busy people on this list.

Mini-PCI uses a different connector than ordinary PCI, and is meant
for laptops.  Do you have some sort of adapter?

I am not a hardware guy.  My googling was not as successful.  Thanks
for the pointer though.  I was previously blissfully unaware there was
any distinction in PCI signalling voltages.

Sorry, I meant to say: miniPCI to PCI adapter board, e.g., this one:

  <http://www.netgate.com/product_info.php?cPath=24_58&products_id=221>

I'll be plugging a miniPCI card, a wifi radio, into it.

Thanks to everyone who responded. And especially because of the 
fact that no one yelled at me. :)

It's been a while since I posted my irate diatribe about Nautilus. 
The next two days after the disaster were 15-hour work days in 
which I had to move a warehouse of paper. Cartons and cartons. I 
figure I moved about 40 tons manually, every bit of it myself, some 
more than once. I came home every night with every bone in my 
body aching. Clearly I was cut out for a sedentary occupation.

Now, getting back to the issue, the first thing I did after discovering 
the problem was to log out/shut down the computer (a laptop). It 
hasn't been turned back on since. So if there is any way to recover 
the files, they should still be on the hard disk.

Some have suggested Midnight Commander for this. I can see if 
Ubuntu-64 shows it in Synaptic. Lots of programs do not appear 
because they won't run in a 64-bit distro. Installing it, however, will 
require disk writes, which may corrupt what's left of the files. Still, 
something's better than nothing, so I'll give it a shot this weekend.

Someone else suggested Rox Filer as an alternative for Nautilus. 
I'll try it out after I exhaust all possibilities of recovering the lost 
files. In the meantime, any additional suggestions for a drag and 
drop file browser are welcome. I don't care about pretty -- I just care 
that it _works_. And, of course, it has to work on 64-bit Ubuntu. It 
would take a lot to get me to abandon Ubuntu.

An additional matter is that I need to figure out how to do backups 
with rsync. Someone gave me a couple lines to use, but they don't 
work. The following is my network situation and what I need to do:

Linux (Ubuntu-64) laptop
Windows 2000 desktop
Several large laser printers (not relevant in this matter)

There is a 200 Gb external USB drive connected to the Windows 
computer. I created two partitions, one NTFS for backups of the 
Windows computer, and the other FAT32 for backups from the 
Linux computer. The FAT32 partition is shared and the Linux latop 
has no problem reading/writing to it.

The line I was given was "rsync -a /path/to/be/backed/up 
/path/to/backup/to." When I try this line (substituting my path 
information), it just gives me error messages. I think the problem is 
that I have not specified the path with correct syntax. For the 
record, the FAT32 partition I created for the Linux backups is seen 
by Windows as f:\. Can someone tell me exactly what to type at 
the command line to create a backup to f:\ from the command line? 
And once having this successfully created, is there a way to do the 
update periodically, like one half hour after turning the laptop on 
(because right after turning it on I probably want to use the full 
power of the CPU and hard disk, not have to share them with 
rsync).

Thanks again for everyone's suggestions and commiseration. I feel 
better now, although physically exhausted. :)

Not sure if anyone on the list has heard of this yet or not.  An
organization called PublicWebStations.com is trying to organize basic
web access for the various shelters for hurricane Katrina victims. 
They have a very basic Linux distro that boots up directly into
Firefox from CD.

Anyway, the idea seems neat, and I'm wondering if anyone knows if
there is anything like this being set up for the Katrina victims that
are supposed to be coming to Portland any day now?

What filesystem were the deleted files sitting on?  Recovering deleted
files is very filesystem-dependent these days.

Because the fuckup known to many as the Red Cross (not to say they
haven't done a ton of good - they have, they're still quite messed up)
has turned down Sheriff Guisto's offer of the Wapato jail, the Katrina
refugees aren't going to be located in a place with 'net access.

I would figure out how to get 'net access to the gym they're going to be
staying in before worrying about how to get them computer access.

Unless PWS.com is setting up terminals the refugees come to?

I'm not sure about this, but there is an effort to help re-establish 
connectivity in the areas hit by the storm. Here's the URL:

http://www.part-15.org/emergencyrelief/katrina.html

I haven't heard anything recently about whether we are getting any 
evacuees in Portland, but I'm pretty sure the basic Telco and Internet 
connectivity is already present.

Do any of you know if FreeGeek is planning to get involved?

1. Let's take this to PLUG-TALK.

2. With all due respect, I think evacuees have a much better support 
network available in Portland and Oregon City than they do in Wapato. 
Plus, their football team used to regularly beat the crap out of the 
Bombers when I was in high school. :) I don't even remember where Wapato 
*is* -- somewhere between Prosser and Yakima, right? A good stiff bus 
ride from any major airport, isn't it?

2 am. The CEO is on a plane to brazil to demo an application after 8 
months of coding.
And someone has run:
cd /etc/
rm -rf /etc/sshd *
Rather than
rm -rf /etc/sshd/*

..on the live, deployment, box. (I really hated getting that cellphone 
call..)

Longest night of my life. (it's pretty hard to use a live box without 
/etc). He eventually found a similar box, and ztermed the data across 
using a live session (as ssh was dead, ftp dead, login dead, etc.).

Nautilus though? Ditch it. GUI's are great ways of getting into trouble.

Hello!
One day I decided it was time to organize the files in my /home directory. I 
got the idea that the best command to use was rm -Rdf ./*  to delete the 
contents of directories I no longer wanted.

Everything was going fine. Files were being put where they needed to be (using 
other commands of course, then I just started to delete things I had no use 
for. I typed the command mentioned above and then all of a sudden I noticed 
the directory I was in was /home. I quickly hit the ctrl-c then ctrl-x hoping 
one would stop the process before everything was gone. The process stopped. I 
was really glad that I had a very large set of files starting with B. I only 
lost about a gig and most of it was not needed. I no longer do this, though 
it works quite well!

We all do dumb stuff, especially when we know better!

Subject: [PLUG] Need corporate volunteer for Asterisk testing
Message-ID: <p0602048bbf476bd8ba59@loligo.com>


I'm developing a configuration suite for Asterisk using the Soekris 
4801 boxes and "astlinux", which is a compact-flash loaded version of 
Linux for those devices.  The 4801 has a PRI/T1 connection on the 
back of the unit.  I hope to have some "how-to" documents for 
small/medium businesses and educational institutions, but I need to 
have a real, live PRI system to test with (my own experiments with 
back-to-back Asterisk servers just don't cut it - I need an actual 
PBX to test with.)  I have a talk to give at Astercon in October on 
this topic, and I'd like to have some actual tested configs to hand 
out.

I would like to see if any small (or medium, or whatever) business 
would allow me to "experiment" with your PBX during off hours, with 
your assistance.  My goal is to get your PBX routing all it's calls 
through a variety of VoIP methods if the destination of the call is 
reachable via VoIP, and if not, to have the call flow normally 
through your existing system.

1) You need to have at least 10 people using  your phone switch

2) Your phone switch must be connected to the PSTN via a PRI (sorry, 
no FXO lines or key systems)

3) You must have a free PRI port on your switch that can make/take 
calls as if it was a PSTN trunk

4) You must be willing/able to change routing on the phone switch 
during experiment periods.  This does not need to be during 
"production" hours.  You should have a decent understanding of how 
your PBX works.

5) You must be willing/able to have an Internet connection going to 
my laptop and the Soekris during the test intervals.

6) Greater Portland area is fine.  Weekends or after hours is fine; 
preferred, in fact.  I'll come over to your site.


I can offer nothing in exchange, other than a brain dump of what I'm 
doing and how you could do it yourself.  If you don't have a VoIP 
system, I'm probably someone you would be interested in talking with 
(for free!) since I have done integrations like this for several 
years, and I would be happy to offer free advice or discussions while 
I tinker with getting this particular configuration working.

Please contact jtodd at loligo.com for details!  Thanks in advance.

Clearly the command line will *NEVER* get you into trouble, as you
demonstrated above :-)

Use GUIs when you want a GUI.  Use the command line when you want a
command line.  Learn them both, because sooner or later you're going
to have to use both of them.

In today's Oregonian (Fri., Sept. 9, 2005, p. A10 of the Sunrise 
Edition) as part of a story on volunteers that begins on page A1, there 
is a paragraph addressing this question a the shelter being prepared in 
the Buckman neighborhood of SE Portland -- the old Washington-Monroe 
High School:

   "Louis Hampton, an information technology specialist with Intel, was 
at the shelter to put the finishing touches on a new computer room 
complete with telephones, wireless connections  and high-speed Internet 
service that will be used by the evacuees."

That sounds like very sensible advice, which I am going to try to 
follow. I have found some very good things I can do in Linux with 
the command line -- things that would be no easier and a lot more 
bother in a GUI.

Right now the issue is file manipulation, however. And for that a 
GUI is what I need. I just need a good one. And that doesn't 
include Nautilus.

Thank god this week is over. Tomorrow I try to pick up the pieces 
of my Linux computer and see if I can put it back together again.

Last I read, ext3 wasn't a filesystem you could undelete files from.
Better check again, though, these things change.  :-)

If you don't find an easier way, take a look at the Sleuth Kit at
http://www.sleuthkit.org.  I would recommend using something like the
Penguin Sleuth Bootable CD from http://www.linux-forensics.com,
instead of using your installed distro.  In particular try some of the
stuff mentioned here:

http://www.sleuthkit.org/sleuthkit/docs/ref_fs.html

This will likely be only feasible for specific files you want to
recover, since I imagine it would take forever otherwise.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0509100958580.9952@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have a 3Com WiFi for my notebook and it works just fine in coffee shops,
hotels, and other hot spots offering free access. This past week, the only
public WiFi access available was in the lobby of the huge Hyatt
hotel/resort/casino. And, it was not free.

   I don't recall who ran the site, but one needed to log on and agree to pay
$9.95 per day for access. I was willing to do this, but the card did not
detect the access point at all. My WiFi WAP detector did, but the card did
not.

   Are these systems Microsoft-specific? I had no light on the card so
'/sbin/iwconfig eth1' did nothing of value. I had no idea what else to try.

This should show you all of the AP's that your card can see (and info 
about what kind of setup they use.)

  iwlist eth1 scan

Of course, make sure that your card didn't move from eth1 to wlan0 or 
whatever (a bare iwconfig will verify this.)  Also, you may need to use 
ifup (or ifconfig) to get the card configured with dhcp, etc.

Eric,

   I could see a report page, but there was no information available on
anything. I'm curious why the card could not see this particular network. Of
course, I don't expect an exact answer to this question, but a broad
explanation of why some networks are not seen while others are.

>  iwlist eth1 scan

   Thanks. I'll try this.

   Nope. No movement. When the system boots the card is recognized on that
port. When I have the interface up and running I run 'dhcpcd -d eth1' to get
a local IP address.

Just a FYI, the folks behind WhiteBox Enterprise Linux (a Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4 rebuid distro - www.whiteboxlinux.org) have been
doing yeoman work in that regard. As they're affiliated with the
Beauregard Parish Library in SW LA (library.beau.org), they've been
working overtime to get evacuees in their area (and apparantly the
numbers are in the thousands, even in their small parish/county)
connected through their systems.

Thanks for the update, I've added my name to the volunteer list.

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: [PLUG] Question about bash scripting -- specifically `set -u'
Message-ID: <e3b7bac05091012334594987f@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All,

I want to play it safe and tell bash to disallow the use of unbound
variables by calling `set -u' at the top of my script.  This is fine
until I check to see if the user has provided the script's required
arguments.  If they haven't, I get an `unbound variable' error.  For
instance, take this little script:

#! /bin/bash

set -u

if [ -n "$1" ]; then
    echo "OK.  \$1 = $1"
else
    echo "You must provide one argument."
    echo "Usage: ${0##*/} ARG"
    exit 1
fi

If the user provides the one required argument `$1' is bound and the
condition works fine; however, if the user invokes the script without
the required argument, the check for `$1' will cause an error such as
`argtest.sh: line 5: $1: unbound variable'.

When using the nounset option, how are you supposed to check for
arguments that may not have been provided?

TIA!

Travis Spencer

If they were dumb and went with LinkSys, then it's LinkSys-only.

Paul,

   One of the association staff at the registration table told me that she
inserted her WiFi card in her laptop (running XP, I believe) and was able to
get a sign-up web page. No idea what hardware she was using. I could not pull
up any web page because my card did not recognize the network.

   Has anyone else encounted a situation like this? Or, are there changes to
configuration files on my notebook that will allow the card to see any and
all networks, free or otherwise?

Thanks,

Rich

Hi:

I have a development box running Linux that also has an Oracle database 
running.
I am reading to buy another box that will also run Linux and it will also 
house
Oracle.  This new box, however, will be considered as "production" quality.
I am looking into what are all the different disk backup options
in Linux.  A good chunk of the data to be backup'ed will be of those Oracle 
data.

Thanks in advance for any tips!

Vincent,

   I've been using BRU for eight years now without any complaints whatsoever.
They changed hands several years ago (the employees bought the company), and
changed their pricing policies, but I suspect they're still in business
despite not advertising in LJ every month.

   I stopped upgrading -- and paying for unneeded support -- several years
ago. The application has worked flawlessly for me, daily/weekly backups and
restores of single files, directories, or the whole system onto a new hard
drive.

   While it has an X interface, I never used that. It runs as a cron job
Monday through Friday nights and just flat out does the job it's supposed to
do. If they're still in business I recommend them without reservation.

Rich

I'm getting ready to handle my own MX. On my server I'm running sendmail
8.13.1. I need to be able to receive mail to sandy_<foo>@herring.org for
any value for <foo> (e.g. sandy_foo at herring.org, sandy_bar at herring.org,
etc. should be "Sender ok") and have it delivered to user `sandy'. But I
don't want to allow dictionary attacks (e.g. red at herring.org should be
"User unknown"). I've got over 100 addresses of the form sandy_<foo> for
which receipt needs to happen. Any time I've had to supply an address to
a web vendor, I've used sandy_vendorDomain at herring.org so that I can
track address misuse.

Even an explicit virtusertable entry such as...

sandy_test at herring.org	sandy

...isn't working. The separator above /is/ a <tab>. And I did do...

makemap hash /etc/mail/virtusertable < /etc/mail/virtusertable

...after creating the entry. Here's the dialog...

Ideally, I'd like to have working...

I'm obviously not understanding how to use virtusertable, much less
wildcards - any /sendmail/ help would be appreciated.

That always works for me... off hand I'd guess that your file isn't in
UNIX format, though I believe /^$/ would match CRLF or NL.  'file
FILENAME' will tell you if it is in DOS format (output will be:  ASCII
text, with CRLF line terminators) Try running dos2unix on your source
file if that is the case.

It's been awhile since I've done Sendmail, but...

unless you need to support virtual domains or unless you're determined to do 
this via virtual tables, I'd accomplish this with aliases

I just tried it and it doesn't work if the file is in DOS format.

Running `file` on it just gives me 'HTML file'.  I copied a .txt from
Windows XP and tried the test and then on a plain text made in linux.
The Windows file did not work but the linux did which leads me to the
question: is the Bluefish editor I used on the HTML file adding a CRLF?!
That just seems silly!

That's what I ended up doing... plugging all 174 addy's into
/etc/aliases. I was hoping I could use a wildcard to handle it, but have
since learned that magic of that sort requires hacking sendmail.cf
directly. I'm loathe to do that. It's a pity that few web sites allow
entering a plus-address'd email - that would have handled it neatly. Too
many squeeze out the plus sign *sigh*.

Of the alternatives, postfix is tempting. But there's a nice milter for
sendmail I'd like to implement once I have everything else working:

Can you elaborate more on this? I've been in a number of offices with my 
laptop that uses an Intel PRO/Wireless 2915  and I've had no issues 
connecting to mostly Linksys access points. Been a mix of 802.11b and g 
networks too.

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Odd delays in Thunderbird
Message-ID: <4325A10C.8000401@comcast.net>

Sometimes, when starting to compose a message in Thunderbird, it takes a 
noticeable amount of time (up to 20 seconds, in extreme instances), 
after the composition window appears before T-bird is ready to accept 
what I type for the To: line. This experience holds whether I'm using 
T-bird on SuSE 9.1, or Win98SE. My wife has a similar experience on 
Win98SE. I've also experienced times when I try to highlight a word with 
the mouse, and nothing happens for about 10 seconds. Then, mouse actions 
return to normal. To be more specific, I can move the mouse cursor to 
the beginning of a word. When I click and drag, nothing happens for up 
to 10 seconds, after which time, I can go back and click and drag  over 
the word normally.

Has anyone else seen something like this?

Could it just be that my 5+ year old machines are not quite up to the 
task of current software? All of our machines are in the 350-500 MHz 
processor speed range.

I find Thunderbird to be pretty responsive unless my computer is running
some other task, then it can be slow.  I'm running Thunderbird at work
on a 600 Mhz Pentium III with Windows 2000.  I have run into similar
problems with the mouse though but in my case the mouse would not do any
sort of selecting/highlighting at all, but if I closed the reply window
and tried again it worked fine.  I don't think I've had this problem
since going to 1.06 though.

1.06 sounds like Firebird's current release number. I just noticed that 
I'm still at Firefox 1.0.4 on my SuSE machine, but I've upgraded to 
1.0.6 on all our Win98 machines. I'm using Thunderbird 1.0.2 on both 
SuSE and Win98. I'll have to check the web site about upgrading.

What are you looking to back up?

Do you want to be able to backup the filesystem or the database or both?

If you want to back up the database, what methods would you consider 
adequate:
export and backup export files as part of a filesystem backup

put the database in archive log mode and do a backup and take it back out of 
archive log mode when finished

have extra disk to mirror the database to which you put into archive log 
mode and break the mirror and then backup the mirror

hotbackup using EBU or RMAN

If you want to backup the database and just backups of the exports aren't 
adequate it will cost you some money either for extra disk to use for 
mirroring/archive logs or the purchase of a commercial backup client like 
Legato Networker, Symantec Netbackup or Arkeia with the oracle backup 
modules. In some cases you might want to do both.

I personally have backed up oracle hot using RMAN or both Legato Networker 
and Netbackup, they both work well, but neither is cheap.

Dick,

   The current release for Thunderchicken is 1.0.6.

   Pamela runs it on her ThinkPad (PII/400MHz) and there are no reports of
delays such as you describe. If there were, I'd certainly hear about them
across the house!

If you're looking for a great Linux-based backup that can do other OS's
as well as your databases in hot mode, check out CA's ARCserve for
Linux.  It rocks.

It costs $775. This would be acceptable to some users,
but not to others. The "others" are end users who
actually are using Linux as an alternative to Windows,
and may not be network administrators.

Not sure what you mean.  If you want to use native tools to do your
backup, you are absolutely correct.  However, I run it on a RHEL AS 4.0
Server, can use command-line or Java web GUI to back up Linux, Unix,
Windows, Netware, AS400, OpenVMS, etc. and a host of databases in hot
mode.

It's just an alternative...that's all.  If native tools work for you,
great.

variety of responses.  I've edited down the replies for easy readability.

I'm not sure what you mean by "you're not using Gigabit".  I'm trying to get
15Mb through an adapter that's capable of 100Mb, so I don't see a limitation
there.

But you're right that the bandwidth speed sites aren't adequate for testing.
I downloaded Knoppix from your site.  It took about 6.1 minutes to download
about 700MB.  If I've done my math right I'm getting 15.3Mb/second.

    700MB * 8 = 5600Mb
    6.1 minutes * 60 = 366 seconds
    5600/366 = 15.3 Mb/second

That's rough, because I haven't figured in the TCP/IP overhead and perhaps
other factors.  Still, I think it tells me my firewall is doing fine.  Did I
make any gross mistakes?

$100/mo for the circuit and the ISP services.  That's for business-grade
service, which permits me to (legally) run servers and use it for commercial
purposes.  Non-commercial service is available for less.

#2 is an obvious idea, but one I overlooked before posting.  In fact,
Charlie's test proved everything was fine, but I should have checked that
first. 

And yes, I was testing from the firewall.  All is fine there as we learned,
but my individual client workstations are still running poorly.  That issue
is still to be researched.

See my comments above about business-grade vs. non-commercial service.  It
depends on what you sign up for and how much you pay.  I can't speak to how
strictly they're enforcing their TOS.

And thanks to Wil and everyone else for the great links.

So I noticed. I ran the upgrade a few minutes ago. I hadn't thought to 
go look for myself to see if there was a newer release than the one I 
was using. The only reason I knew to upgrade Firefox was that the 
browser has a little icon to tell you there's a newer release. I'll have 
to check more often, or at least, whenever Firefox tells me it's moving up.

The problem was intermittent. It may take a few days without seeing it 
for me to get the idea that it's been fixed.

Dick,

   Perhaps this is the application's way of telling you to upgrade. It's not
as elegant as an icon winking at you, but it worked. :-)

   Glad you fixed the problem.

You don't by chance have an ldap account configured for addresses do  
you? In the past, I have noticed composing delays (sometimes to the  
point of being totally unresponsive) associated with Thunderbird  
communicating with the LDAP server.

Subject: [PLUG] Vim scripting problem
Message-ID: <20050913031318.95874.qmail@web60811.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

Is there any way, in a vim script, to get "dollar digit" variables such
as those used in Perl to extract matched text? I have the following:

  function GotoCFile()
    if search('^\s*#\s*cfile:\s*\(\w\+\)')

      " $1 is not the variable in vim
      exe "echo 'Found ".$1."'"
    else
      exe "echo 'Could not find name of corresponding file'"
    end
  endfunction

I'm trying to find a Perl comment like this:

    # cfile: somefile

And assign "somefile" to a variable. I've searched all over the Vim
documentation for this and it seems to involve finding the starting and
ending positions of the match and doing a bit of math and a extracting
a substring. Tell me it's not this hard!

Cheers,
Ovid

No. Just the local address book in T-Bird.

   Has anyone been able to get the Garmin MapSource cds to install and run
under Wine? Or, have you read of someone who has?

   It would be great to install the data on my notebook and be able to
transfer specific maps to the little GPS receiver (a Garmin eTrex Legend)

Doesn't look likely, but you could try the gvim gurus on irc or 
something.  I've had them answer strange questions immediately after 
hours of searching the docs.

This is slightly enlightening to your situation (at least it tells you 
not to expect too much.)

:help search
  "When a match has been found its line number is returned, and
    the cursor will be positioned at the match."


>  function GotoCFile()
>    if search('^\s*#\s*cfile:\s*\(\w\+\)')

Sounds like your best bet is to go with the fact that the cursor is now 
at the beginning of the matching line.

Maybe substitute() (which interestingly enough leads to the docs for 
submatch() and that happens to be just close enough to what you need to 
make you really frustrated at the infinite ad-hoc development :-)

Why would you expect otherwise?  I guess you can try using vim-perl.  If 
not, you should expect more of the same.

   I have Wine-20050831 installed here, and configured correctly ... I think.
Since I could not run the application off the cdrom, I copied all that to an
nfs-mounted filesystem and tried running it from within the designated "c:\"
drive in my ~/. Here's what I see:

[rshepard at salmo ~/wine/drives/c]$ wine /mnt/usr4/MapSource/Setup.exe 
wine: cannot find '/mnt/usr4/MapSource/Setup.exe'

   I've read the FAQ and docs on the WineHQ Web site and cannot figure out
what I've missed. Of course, it's possible that the application just will not
install, but I'd like to be sure that I've tried properly before giving up.

   All suggestions welcome.

Well, for Wine to work, it needs to be able to map a Windows drive to
the path.  Maybe it doesn't know how, in this case.

I've always had good luck just changing to the directory where the
Windows binary is and running from there.

But really, it should be able to run from the CD-ROM anyway.  That's a
red flag right there.

Have you found any info anywhere on whether anyone else has tried
running MapSource under Wine?  I'd be quite surprised if you were the
first.  It might even be listed on the WineHQ compatibility database.

AFAIK, wine expects a path with respect to the fake windows drives it
knows about.  Most likely, wine configured your cdrom to show up as a
D: drive, your home directory to be Z: or some such, and so on.  It
probably did *not* enable access to /mnt/usr4, and therefore can't
find the file.

Did you try running it off of the cdrom? (wine /mnt/cdrom/Setup.exe) 
If that fails with the same error, try copying it into ~/wine/drives/c
and running it out of there.  Alternatively, check your wine config,
and setup /mnt/usr4 to be a fake windows drive, and call it H or
something.

Aaron,

   It's quite possible that I have not properly configured wine. In
~/.wine/dosdevices I have a soft link, c:\, that points to ~/wine/drives/c/.
It was from the latter directory (that contains the windows/ file tree) that
I invoked wine; not from the directory with the application.

   I don't have a windows binary, just wine.

   Nope. I checked the application database and could find nothing. There are
a couple of applications that transfer data between a PC and a Garmin GPS of
various flavors, but that's not the issue here.

   Once, a couple of years ago, I actually got an application to run the
installer under wine, but not the application itself. I am so ignorant of
things Windows that I cannot tell if the Slackware package I have installed
is complete or properly figured. And, I have gone through the Web site's
online documentation. For example, I have a WIN.INI file, but no wine.ini
file.

Thanks,

Rich

Rogan,

   Here's the pertinent sections of ~/.wine/config and ~/.wine/dosdrives:

[Drive C]
"Path" = "/home/rshepard/wine/drives/c/"
"Type" = "hd"
"Label" = "MS-DOS"
"Filesystem" = "win95"

[Drive D]
"Path" = "/mnt/cdrom"
"Type" = "cdrom"
"Label" = "CD-Rom"
"Filesystem" = "win95"
; make sure that device is correct and has proper permissions !
"Device" = "/dev/cdrom"

   and,

   Yes. This is what I tried first.

   This application cdrom holds 587M of data.

   Thinking that wine might not like nfs-mounted filesystems, I moved the
cdrom image from /mnt/usr4/MapSource to a local filesystm, /data1/MapSource.
No difference in trying to install the app.

   I'll try calling /data1/MapSource/ drive e:\ and see if that makes any
difference. Then I give up and beat on VMware again for upgrade support.

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] USB serial adapter
Message-ID: <c29537840509131141469aba30@mail.gmail.com>

There was a thread on here not too long ago about USB serial adapters,
and I'm in the market for one.  I'm looking for a USB->DB9 adapter to
use for debugging kernel stuff on my desktop from my laptop (which is
of course missing a DB9 plug).  Anyone have any suggestions on an
adapter that works under Linux?

Could you provide the specifics?  Where you were when you ran wine,
how you supplied the path, and anything else that seems relevant?

I would expect that this would work:

cd /mnt/cdrom/
wine Setup.exe

(assuming Setup.exe is in /mnt/cdrom, if not modify the first command
to get you in sosme directory below /mnt/cdrom that contains
Setup.exe)

Rogan,

   Here's an example that mimics what you wrote:

[rshepard at salmo /data1/MapSource]$ wine Setup.exe 
Warning: could not find DOS drive for current working directory
'/data1/MapSource', starting in the Windows directory.
wine: cannot find 'Setup.exe'

   In ~/.wine/config I have:

[Drive F]
"Path" = "/data1/Mapsource/"
"Type" = "hd"
"Label" = "Home"
"Filesystem" = "win95"

   So, from within ~/wine/drives/c/windows:

[rshepard at salmo ~/wine/drives/c/windows]$ wine /data1/MapSource/Setup.exe 
wine: cannot find '/data1/MapSource/Setup.exe'

and

[rshepard at salmo ~/wine/drives/c/windows]$ wine f:\Setup.exe
wine: cannot find 'f:Setup.exe'

   So, there must be something in the setup or configuration that I've missed
here.

Many thanks,

Rich

Jason,

   I bought one a while ago that I never did get to work. So I, too, am
interested in one that works with the 2.4 kernel series.

That was my thread, and I got (and will pass on) two pieces of advice:

>From a friend at Intel:
	They suck, don't use them.

>From the USB users list:
	Buy Belkin

And my own advice:

Good luck,

Why not have the freedom of 30ft!!

There are probably a few more like this on the market as well.

I have a couple different ones at home that work out-of-the-box with
FC3 (2.6 kernel). One is single-port adapter and the other is a multi-port 
adapter. I'll post the make/model info when I get home.

I can't recall the exact sequence of my hardware purchases and my OS 
upgrades, but it seems like I had the single-port adapter working prior
to FC3, possibly even FC1, but the multi-port adapter didn't work
until FC3.

My story is different.  For some reason my my ThinkPad T-20, the USB
serial adapter works better than the built-in RS-232 with my Palm.  I
might have something set wrong in the BIOS, because it used to work
okay, or maybe it has something to do with the 2.6 kernel.  Greg
Kroah-Hartman recommended the ATEN-based ones and since he wrote the
damn driver, I'll prefer his advice.  I posted the exact model of mine
some time ago to the list:

Aaron,

   This looks good, but for one catch: the need for 100 VAC on the serial
device side. That eliminates this solution for digital cameras, GPS
receivers, and the like.

   It is an interesting approach, however.

Thanks,

Rich

Terry,

   My needs are simple: connect the digital camera or GPS receiver to the
notebook, one at a time.

   Since the notebook runs the USB port quite happily with the 2.4 kernel I
was disappointed to discover that the USB<->serial adapter wouldn't work.

Thanks,

Rich

We've been doing some work with a Free2Move serial-bluetooth dongle.
You just need to provide 5VDC to the dongle.  The USB dongle, a
linksys device, laptop-side runs off of USB power.

  <http://www.free2move.se/prod_spp.htm>

We put together a Class 1 (100m range) bluetooth kit for about $300
for all parts including a nice Li-Ion camcorder battery that will
power the dongle for about 48 hours/charge.  Works great.  We *needed*
electrical isolation though, so wireless was a requirement.

I am sure you can do cheaper though.  I bought what amounted to a
USB-serial adapter from Radio Shack for ~$22 and some solder, though
it was for use with 3.3V serial signal levels as a console cable to a
Netgear WGT634u.

I recently had the good(?) fortune to have to extract as much data as
I could from a dying drive.  In the process I found a much better way
to pull the data off than plain dd.

There is a script called dd_rhelp included in Kurt Garloff's
"ddrescue" package (http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/ddrescue/) that
does a great job of pulling data off damaged/flaky drives.  It
provides nice real-time statistics on the data recovery process and is
simple to use.  ("dd_rhelp <source drive> <destination file>")

This is not to be confused with the GNU software "ddrescue" which is
similar, but has not been updated recently and does not include
dd_rhelp.

On thing I also noticed-- if your drive has any Linux RAID autodetect
partitions (unlikely on a laptop) the Linux kernel will try to
activate/re-sync them on startup.  I think the RAID identifiers will
prevent it from re-syncing over the top of the data you're trying to
save-- but it's possible for this to go awry, trashing the data you're
trying to save.

That's when a hardware write blocker might be handy to borrow from
someone (or purchase for about $300 if desperate...)

Rob,

   No. I didn't. I took it as it's presented on the cdrom.

I'm running out of suggestions, but you cuold try as above, but:

wine f:/Setup.exe

or 

wine "f:\Setup.exe"

(both with the intent of making that slash "stick" rather than acting
as an escape char.)

Although, I suggest trying it from the same directory as the setup
binary, so you don't have to debug the pathing any more than you
absolutely must.

I re-read this, and realized it is somewhat ambiguous.  Running the
command without any path information seems wise, and the safest way I
know to do that is to simply be in the same directory as the file it
can't find, so, given that /data1/Mapsource is defined as a drive in
your wine conf (as you do, from previous messages)  Then, you might
try this:

cd /data1/Mapsource
wine Setup.exe

Getting around (hopefully) the issues with escape characters and
windows drive names.  This is what I've done in the past with success
when dealing with wine.

If you have tried this, and I missed it, or just didn't understand, I
apologise for beating a dead horse.

Okay, here's what I got that works.

The single-port adapter is a SIIG model 02-0882A. The multi-port adapter
is an Edgeport/c from Inside Out Networks. It has two 9-pin serial ports
and two USB ports.

Me, for one. I don't have all my NDA's in front of me, but I guess it's 
safe to say that I spend a lot of my time working on network and 
host-attack security issues for three-letter-agencies.

I worked in so many aspects of computing and networking that I had 
gained the needed knowledge base for the work I'm doing, and I didn't

Well, it's a *huge* field.... you might have to narrow down the 
question a bit. There's alphabet soup out there covering all the 
different aspects, and it's far beyond anything one human could learn 
in a lifetime....

For example, somebody specializing in designing hardware encryption 
devices needs a totally different background than somebody specializing 
in writing corporate security policy, and somebody researching the 
detection of network threats needs a different background than somebody 
focusing on social engineering....

Is there a specific area you're looking into?

Of course.  But what happens when you try to run it off of the cdrom?

I've only really used wine to run AutoCAD, but had to copy an installed 
version from my windows machine and hack on the registry and even then 
it requires a specific incantation to get it running.

When using vim as an editor, the matched patterns in parenthesis are
called up by escaping the number with a backslash instead of a dollar
symbol.

The perl regexp

s/(foo)(bar)/$2$1/

would be

s/\(foo\)\(bar\)/\2\1/

This works for vim in editing mode.  I don't know how much different
the behavior is with vim scripts.  The relevant document on my Gentoo
system is

/usr/share/vim/vim63/doc/change.txt

You might want to look for that file somewhere equivalent on your
system if you're still working on this problem.

Rogan,

   I typed the command with the backslash, to emulate what one would do in
windohs, and the error message returned by wine removed it.

   Done.

   Anywho, yesterday evening I received a call from VMware and purchased their
"gold" support (which, for $6 more than the silver support, includes
telephone as well as e-mail). I'm confident that once I get this upgrade
issue fixed -- and it's the worst upgrade FUBAR since the pre-1.0 beta
versions I ran -- I'll have access to the MapSource data from there.

   It would be nice to load all 586M on the laptop and run it with wine, but I
have higher priorities for my attention.

   Thanks very much for all the suggestions. It would have been nice for one
to have actually worked. :-)

   I'm happy to confirm that the SIIG model 02-0882A works on my notebook,
too. I think that the adapter needs some hotplug accessory utilities that I
did not have installed when I first tried to get it working. In the process
of getting the WiFi card working, all those missing tools were discovered and
installed. So, the USB<->serial adapter now works here.

You lost the backslash there.  You have to say f:\\Setup.exe to get it 
through the shell.

Eric,

   Were it only that simple. :-)

[rshepard at salmo /data1/MapSource]$ wine f:\\Setup.exe Warning: could not find
DOS drive for current working directory '/data1/MapSource', starting in the
Windows directory.
wine: cannot find 'f:\Setup.exe'

   So there's one more slash in each path reference, but there's still no one
home.

Thanks for the suggestion, Eric,

Woot! a new error message! (well, a warning, but I think it points to
a bug in your config)

Mapsource vs. MapSource could very well be the problem, since the unix
path is still case sensative, even if the windows path is not.

Correct.  But does wine pay any attention to changes in ~/.wine/config 
after there is a symlink in ~/.wine/dosdevices ?  IIRC, it only does 
something like a one-time conversion (which I believe is just meant to 
provide easy upgrades.)  Thus, you may have to manually fix the symlink 
to f:

Rogan,

   Could be, but isn't. Thanks to your sharp eyes, I made the change and tried
it again. Same negative results of paths/files not being found.

Subject: [PLUG] Javascript Array Problem
Message-ID: <432874D7.4010809@comcast.net>

I'm working on adding a category of images to my photo website. (The 
problem described below is on my machine at home, and not up on the web, 
yet, so I'll just have to describe it.)

I have a set of arrays to hold information about the images in each 
category, and I build them with the following javascript code:

//===================================================================
   // Function to initialize an array of n entries
   function MakeArray(n) {
     this.length = n
     for (var i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
       this[i] = 0
     }
     return this
   }


//=================================================================
   // constructor function for array elements
   function img(code, caption, qty0, qty1, qty2, qty3, qty4) {
     this.code = code
     this.caption = caption
     this.qty0 = 0
     this.qty1 = 0
     this.qty2 = 0
     this.qty3 = 0
     this.qty4 = 0
     }

//======================================================================
function buildPortlandArray() {
   portlandArray[1] = new img("P0001", "Oregon City Bridge")
   portlandArray[2] = new img("P0002", "End of the Oregon Trail")
   portlandArray[3] = new img("P0003", "Sacagawea - Washington Park")
   portlandArray[4] = new img("P0004", "Pittock Mansion, Portland, OR")
   portlandArray[5] = new img("P0005", "Vista House, Crown Point")
   }

//===================================================================
function initializeSite() {
// other things happen in this function, but I cut out most of it for
// the sake of brevity

   var portlandImageCount = 5

   portlandArray = MakeArray(portlandImageCount)
   buildPortlandArray()
   }

In the category I'm trying to add with buildPortlandArray, the first two 
entries of the array return as "undefined" but the last three work just 
fine. There are four other arrays on the site that all work as expected.

Has anyone ever seen something like this before, where the first two 
entries in an array don't work, but the last three do?

Thanks for any ideas you may have to offer.

There's not a single end-of-statement semicolon anywhere in this code.
Are we seeing undefined behavior?  I've fixed at least one js bug by
putting in semicolons.

My javascript is rusty, but shouldn't this array start at 0?

Subject: [PLUG] Javascript Array Problem

I'm working on adding a category of images to my photo website. (The problem
described below is on my machine at home, and not up on the web, yet, so
I'll just have to describe it.)

I have a set of arrays to hold information about the images in each
category, and I build them with the following javascript code:

//===================================================================
   // Function to initialize an array of n entries
   function MakeArray(n) {
     this.length = n
     for (var i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
       this[i] = 0
     }
     return this
   }


//=================================================================
   // constructor function for array elements
   function img(code, caption, qty0, qty1, qty2, qty3, qty4) {
     this.code = code
     this.caption = caption
     this.qty0 = 0
     this.qty1 = 0
     this.qty2 = 0
     this.qty3 = 0
     this.qty4 = 0
     }

//======================================================================
function buildPortlandArray() {
   portlandArray[1] = new img("P0001", "Oregon City Bridge")
   portlandArray[2] = new img("P0002", "End of the Oregon Trail")
   portlandArray[3] = new img("P0003", "Sacagawea - Washington Park")
   portlandArray[4] = new img("P0004", "Pittock Mansion, Portland, OR")
   portlandArray[5] = new img("P0005", "Vista House, Crown Point")
   }

//===================================================================
function initializeSite() {
// other things happen in this function, but I cut out most of it for // the
sake of brevity

   var portlandImageCount = 5

   portlandArray = MakeArray(portlandImageCount)
   buildPortlandArray()
   }

In the category I'm trying to add with buildPortlandArray, the first two
entries of the array return as "undefined" but the last three work just
fine. There are four other arrays on the site that all work as expected.

Has anyone ever seen something like this before, where the first two entries
in an array don't work, but the last three do?

Thanks for any ideas you may have to offer.

Javascript arrays are sparse.  They're not really numerical-indexed
arrays, they're more like associative arrays.  It's still good form to
start them at 0, but it's not a bug to start at 1.

I believe function MakeArray() is unnecessary.  You do not have to
pre-pad an array in javascript.  Just use:

     var newArray = new Array();
     newArray[1] = "the value of 1";
     newArray[37] = "the value of 37";

Note the large skip in indices.  Perfectly legal in javascript.  This is
what I mean by sparse.

Or you could opt for a real associative array, with strings for keys:

     var newAlist = new Object();
     newAlist["one"] = "the value of one";
     newAlist["thirtyseven"] = "the value of thirtyseven";

though this has nothing to do with the current problem.  Just an
observation to help unserstanding of js arrays.  an Array() is an
associative array with numbers for keys, though they can be any numbers,
and not even consecutive.  An Object() can be used as a string-keyed
associative array.

I still say all bets are off until some semicolons get put in.

I added semicolons to every statement, but saw no change in behavior.

While the first entry in the array is position 0, that entry contains 
the number of the rest of the entries in the array. I got this bit of 
cleverness from Danny Goodman's JavaScript Handbook. As he explains:

"If you look at the MakeArray() function closely, you'll notice that the 
first entry(row) of the array is assigned not only a value (the number 
of rows of the whole array), but also the name(length). This first 
entry, which has an index value of 0, can now be accessed by your script 
with what appears to be a familiar array length property reference:

arrayLen = myArray.length

"Unlike JavaScript's own objects and arrays, then, the 0 index of these 
transient arrays should not contain any real data..."

So, Bill, you are right, but not for this example.

I am setting up a FreekBox ($45 P3-450MHz from FreeGeek) we got a
month or so ago, as a play machine for my kids and various cousins.
It has a RIVA 128 4MB video card.  Except for Knoppix, I don't have
any experience with KDE.  After a screensave and when the display
comes back, the desktop background has fuzzed out.  It is fine on
boot, and I can restore the gear image by changing the desktop
background image.  Anybody seen this before?  Know how to fix?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0509141931400.25445@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Just out of curiosity, has anyone else experienced importing an ASCII file
to OO.o and have all the hyphens in phone numbers and ZIP codes converted to
non-printing dashes?

   I've imported quite a few ASCII text files into OO.o and this is the first
time the unwanted change has happened. It's an 18-page file, too. Worse yet,
I've no idea how to specify that character so I can do a global search and
replace.

  Try copying the character by highlighting it then pasting it into the 
search box and place the - in the replace box and see if it will find it.

Keith, Vram, et al.:

   I had tried this unsuccessfully. But, this morning it worked. Perhaps I
accidently wedged something in OO.o and it took being shut down and
re-invoked to clear it up.

Thanks,

I know you can use /dev/null as a login shell for user accounts for
restricted access - for example accounts that will allow a user to ftp to
a box.

reference: http://www.faqs.org/docs/securing/chap29sec295.html

However, can you use the mechanism for running binaries with a specific ID?

running the binary SUID or from a startup file that sudos to the ID in
question.

By "mechanism", do you mean changing the login shell entry?  Yeah.  You 
can put whatever you want in there.

I have my notebook setup like this:

#########
$ grep ^ex /etc/passwd
ex::1000:1000:Nobody,Nowhere,,:/home/ex:/usr/local/bin/be_ewilhelm

$ cat /usr/local/bin/be_ewilhelm
#!/bin/sh
su - ewilhelm startx
#########

So, instead of starting a display manager, it boots to a login prompt.  
The problem with logging in as a user and then running startx is that 
someone can Alt+F1 and kill X to get your login even if you locked the 
X display.  If you do that with this setup, it drops you back to the 
login prompt because the "ex" user's shell exited.

I didn't exactly grok part 2 of your question, but maybe the above means 
yes.

Bah, nevermind.  I found a good example with http running as nobody on my

If you mean that no shell is listed for user 'nobody', then that usually
means "use the default shell", generally /bin/sh.  For example, the
following line in /etc/passwd gives 'nobody' the shell '/bin/sh':

    nobody:*:32767:32767:Unprivileged user:/:

What you really want is either an invalid shell (like /dev/null,
suggested above), or, better, a shell which does nothing.  For example:

    nobody:*:32767:32767:Unprivileged user:/:/bin/false

This works best if /bin/false is a statically linked binary on your
system, not a shell script which exits nonzero, as it is on some
systems.  The following C code will produce a reasonably safe and
compact statically linked /bin/false:

    #include <unistd.h>
    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        _exit(1);
    }

Cheers.

Ditch Nautilus.

I'm serious, dude. That buggy piece of crap cost me four days of 
work recently. Were we in a private discussion I would express my 
feelings about it more precisely. I have native competence in three 
languages and I would use them all, most particularly the

  That is what I am thinking. It doesn't make sense that KDE works
flawlessly with the mounted DVD while nautilus reports that I just
inserted a blank DVD.

bah.. all this bad mouthing... nautilus works completely excellent for
me. 

As far as what the person is actually asking about. I have never had
that behavior so I'm not sure what might be wrong.. Especially my
current desktop.. Ubuntu Breezy/Gnome 2.12.. (laptop support,_awesome_ )

This may be slightly off-topic, but while we're on the subject of
bashing Nautilus, the September 6 episode of Cringely's NerdTV has an
interview of Apple developer Andy Hertzfeld in which he talks about
the development of Nautilus, and his disappointment with what became
of the project.  Basically, the original aspirations of Nautilus were
much more ambitious: it was to be a "graphical shell," a new kind of
interface.  After the initial project ran out of funding, another
group took it over and turned into a clone of the Windows desktop
explorer.  I thought it was a good show.  It's available for regular
download or bittorrent from pbs.org/nerdtv.

   Is anyone here using a Garmin GPS receiver of the low-end, personal type? I
have an eTrex Legend and just purchased the MapSource Topo cdrom set. But,
the cartography on these disks are 20-25 years out of date, at least. I
wonder if I can load more current map data into these units.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0509171619300.9161@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   The 600E we have here seems to have had the keyboard die; a couple of days
ago it was a couple of keys, today only the function keys work. Can't boot
because the enter key does not function.

   Along the top of the keyboard area is a row of little lcd indicator lights.
There's one for battery power, caps lock on, num lock on, scroll lock on, and
one more. I've no idea what the one on the right end indicates (we cannot
locate the manual here), and I wonder if its being on is keeping the keyboard
from working.

   I cannot find an online manual for this model; only a couple of people
trying to sell one. If you have a manual, or you know what this light
indicates, please let me know. Otherwise I guess I need to take the box to be
repaired this coming week.

Thanks,

Rich

gas station, lodging, fast-food, hospital, bar, etc.

Jesse,

   The hardware is one thing; the eTrex Legend does me just fine for knowing
my geographic coordinates when I'm out in the boonies. The MapSource Topo,
however, has ancient data and the company charges a very high price for such
old data.

   I have much more recent data for all the states in which I travel. If I
could get that data into the Garmin I'd be quite happy.

   No. I don't have one. I suppose that we could attach one on top of the
existing keyboard with velcro and it would be less expensive than having the
defective keyboard (assuming that's what it is) replaced.

Thanks, Russell,

FWIW, I've replaced a few laptop keyboards... it's usually not very
difficult to accomplish.  A new keyboard can often be had for around $70
or so, and installation on a laptop you're not familiar with could take
maybe a half hour or so.

Usually you remove obvious screws, pop off the piece of plastic between
the keyboard and the screen, remove another screw or two, flip the
keyboard up, pull out the ribbon cable, remove old keyboard, and do
exactly the opposite with the new keyboard.

Bill,

Have you thought about approaching Garmin directly? You never know,  
they may be willing to cut you some sort of deal.

Well, I can't help much -- I, too, have a manual-less 600E (with FreeBSD 
on it); but I can tell you that the little green LED you mention is ALWAYS 
on on my system, and the keyboard works fine.

David,

   I thought that the light was on continuously, but it was something to
check.

   The IBM web page provides a sequence of tests that I'll conduct today. I
suspect that it needs a new keyboard, the arrow keys and function keys work,
but not the letters or [Enter].

Thanks,

Rich

   Following the IBM diagnostic instructions, I ran tests on the whole system.
Everything checked out OK, but when I invoked the keyboard advanced
diagnostics, I discovered that all keys work except for the following:
                             [Enter]
   [z][x][c][v]    [m][,][.] [Right Shift]
                             [Right Ctrl]

   Strange. I'll call Northwest Computer Support tomorrow and ask them how
much it costs to replace the keyboard (I don't see any visible screws and
I've not done any build/repair work on portables over the years).

Thanks, everyone,

Rich

By any chance have you tried the old reliable take a can of canned air
and blow out all the gunk beneath the keys diagnostic?  Physical
obstruction is a keyboard killer.  Hair, dust and crumbs are enough to
disturb operation.

By any chance have you tried the old reliable take a can of canned air
and blow out all the gunk beneath the keys diagnostic?  Physical
obstruction is a keyboard killer.  Hair, dust and crumbs are enough to
disturb operation.

Michael,

   That was the first thing I did. Cleaner, compressed air, gentle banging;
nothing but a few hairs turned up.

Thanks for the suggestion,

   Follow up:

   A bit of Google turned up 1) a site selling refurbished keyboards for the
600E and 2) instructions for disassembly. The former is a reasonable price
and the latter looks pretty easy to do.

   The screws to be removed are marked with arrows on the case and they're
covered with rubber disks.

   More when I have it done.

Something else to try...

I've had weird things happen when things wiggle loose. DIMMs, Video 
cards, fuses in my car.

I'd try removing and replacing the current keyboard, along with 
reseating any socketed components in your system.

Russ,

   OK. Later this evening. It is not obvious to me that a loose connection
would affect only some keys, but what the heck ... it'll be a test drive of
my ability to take it apart and reassemble it so it works. Sorta'. :-)

   I've never before dinked with a portable, other than to replace a hard
drive or add memory.

Thanks,

Rich

Well, the IBMs are about the nicest ones to work on.  Just make sure
you use screwdrivers that fit well (Philips screwdrivers come in
several sizes such as #2, #1, #0 and #00 and the wrong size will strip
a screw) and be careful about forcing things.

-- 
All parts should go together without forcing.  You must remember that
the parts you are reassembling were disassembled by you.  Therefore,
if you can't get them together again, there must be a reason.  
By all means, do not use a hammer.    -- IBM maintenance manual, 1925

If the keyboard scan signals travel over the keyboard connector, a
problem affecting only certain keys is quite possible.  OTOH, if the
microcontroller that scans the keyboard is part of the keyboard assembly,
it's very unlikely that you have a simple connector problem.

galen,

   That's good to know. The built-in diagnostics passed the system board tests
(as well as all the others) so it's either in the keyboard itself or the
connector.

   Details at 11:00 ...

Many thanks,

Hi all, 

Last night I bought a close-out item a kmart for my son:

A Mattel Juice Box Video, MP3, and Photo viewer.

Box, MP3 kit, and Headphones, total cost $22.50.

As I understand it, this box is running on linux and a quite large

Hacking community is springing up to try to get a home grown video player on
it.

I currently uses a proprietary player embedded on the purchased cartridges,
but

It has an SD/MMC adapter available.


This is beyond my abilities, but I wanted to share it with the list and

See if anyone here knows any more about it.

Even if putting your own videos on it never pans out, its quite a bargain
for 

An MP3 player.

Message-ID: <432F17CE.2020203@acm.org>

I've done a bit of looking but nothing encouraging showed up via Google 
so I'm hoping someone here might have suggestions.

I've just moved to a shop that is trying to transition from WinXP 
desktops to Linux systems.  The first step seems to be to get the users 
away from the MS stuff as much as possible.  The plan is evolving 
towards Firefox, Thunderbird ( and Sunbird .)  The current issue is 
getting Outlook generated invitations into Sunbird ( aka. Thunderbird 
Calendar ).  I see it is on the Mozilla developers list but not done yet.

Is there any alternatives that would do this.  Ie. user gets Invitation 
from an Outlook user.  They could click "I accept" and get the entry 
into their calendar.

Still a small-ish shop: approx. 30 users with over half still stuck in 
the MS world of Outlook, a few using Thunderbird on MS, some lucky ones 
on Linux boxes using Thunderbird or Evolution, and a few more on MACs ( 
graphic designers. )


TIA,
Rod

Rod,

   If this is still not a smooth transition, why not leave it for later and do
the easy things first? For example, convert the servers to linux and use
samba to support those who must remain with certain Microsoft applications.
In the meantime, phase in OO.o and other office applications in their
Microsoft and Apple incarnations so staff become used to working with those
tools.

   Yesterday, a friend in Boulder who has to keep running Microsoft because so
many of his clients still do that, told me that he cannot keep XP running for
more than 1.5 hours at a time, even when he's using only Access and some VBA
scripts. In my naivete, I would think that managers would prefer to forego a
calendaring application to gain the ability to keep the systems up and not
have to take forced coffee breaks for rebooting during the work day.

Rich,

I have a Eagle MapGuide Pro and tried this approach with them a few 
years ago.  I wanted to generate custom maps from GIS and other data. 
When I asked about getting the database format I was told that it was 
propietary information.  The license made reverse engineering a sick bird.

I hope you have better luck with Garmin.  If you do I know what my next 
GPS unit will be.

Rod,

   The saddest part of this whole situation is that all the data they use are
freely available on government Web sites. I've been getting the latest
spatial data for years from state and federal agencies. If the companies
whose entire business is the sale of maps and the devices to display them
cannot provide either current data or the tools to convert from open standard
sources to their proprietary, internal formats, then we're part of the
problem by not making enough noise.

   My sub-survey grade GPS (+/- 30 cm accuracy with real-time differential
corrections from the USGS beacon transmitters) has mission planning and
post-processing software that works only on Microsoft. The company won't
consider supporting linux even though it's only a relatively simple port.
Sigh.

   I'll let everyone know what I learn from Garmin.

We're there with the servers.  There is a changing of the guard going on 
  so SAMBA isn't here but coming soon.  ( Other more critical issues to 
handle first. )  OpenOffice is pretty much on its way.

My take is that a clean-sweep change-over won't happen until all the 
issues are solved/sorted-out.  Surprisingly the WinXP systems stay up 
very well and get shut-down every night so a reboot happens!

The calendaring is for individuals, so far, to manage their activies not 
for management.  Switching to Sunbird isn't too big an issue.  It is 
being able to interact with customers that use MS and the few here that 
still live for the MS solution.

Yeah, especially about the torque crews that hold the heatsink on the
CPU :(  Anyone know where to get little specialized pieces like that?
(Not Torx screws; these are *designed* to break if you apply too much
pressure.)

Wil,

   Look on pages 1492-1493 of the Mouser Electronics catalog. They seem to
have everything else for the electronics industry. They have a set of drivers
(flat and Phillip screw, Torx, and hex) from very small to small.

Actually, I've had those ribbon cables that end in an edge connector 
lose a line or two, and that's exactly what happens. Partial failure of 
whatever component is attached.

The issue for Rich and myself is we want current data on our GPS 
systems.  Not adding another piece of equipment ( Laptop, PDA, etc. ) to 
haul around.  That said: gpsdrive was the software I was really thinking 
of during my earlier post.  It looks great but the page once again shows 
two pieces of equipment -- PDA and GPS.
    But ... I seem to remember seeing PC-CARDs ( PCMCIA ) that had a 
whole GPS receiver and decoder in the package.  One of those and a PDA 
running gpsdrive would provide a really neat solution.

Back to the magazines and some searching for the _right_ parts for me.

Rod,

   I have here an "Earthmate" GPS receiver sold by DeLorme. I bought this
years ago but never did get it to work with my Palm PDA. Will sell for a very
low price. :-)

   It's the current data on the Garmin that I want as a solution.

   Status report: The keyboard section is loose except along the right side. I
cannot find any screws that I missed, but something is holding it down back
there. I sent an e-mail to a student at the U. Manchester because it's his
instructions I'm following.

   So far, so good.

Bill,

   I need to find the screw on the right side, near the rear, that's keeping
it from coming apart. But, the instructions I found on the Web mention a
regular connector, not a ZIF one.

> (Couldn't find your web address)

   Huh. It's in my .sig and loads when I try it.

Just wondering if the upcoming Government Open Source Conference

anyone here familiar with the quality of the sessions? Will it be half

Good?  You mean tasty technical details about cutting-edge projects that 
were first posted one week before the conference?  No.

As I understand it, this is a totally different beast, meant mostly to 
give government IT guys a rundown on how and why to use open source in 
their everyday problem-solving.  Did you hear something different?

Sure, these guys are a technical audience and there will probably be 
several sessions of nitty-gritty, but I don't think that Larry Wall is 
coming.  You also probably shouldn't expect to see anything like 
Damian's "how to build a beowulf out of laserjets" talk.

--Eric
-- 
Issues of control, repair, improvement, cost, or just plain
understandability all come down strongly in favor of open source
solutions to complex problems of any sort.

Some notebooks have little tabs or even clips look between the keys along
the bottom. Also check that the plastic along the top by the screen is off,
some times they hide screws under there to. You may also have to pull the
whole keyboard straight up sometimes they have like long shafts for the
screws.

The gently pushing the keyboard up or down (horizontally); they
something have a little catch they slide into.

The IBM website still has all the support documents for the
Thinkpads. Here is a good place to start.

   Now it's no longer stuck on the side, but still attached at the rear. Wish
I had a manual for this thing. Guess it's time to find someone on the Web who
sells them.

You might try bringing it by FreeGeek.  Those guys seem able to get
anything apart, no matter how counterintuitive it may be.

   Thanks, Steve. I'll do that today. I got the top section up except for the
very back side. I am cautious about prying, pulling, or tearing out what
should remain behind.

Steve,

   I got it. One of the manuals from the IBM site has detailed (pictorial)
instructions; I just didn't look far enough back in that manual the first
time I looked at it.

   Now to order the replacement keyboard and get the whole thing back together
so it works.

Many thanks,

Rich

   One of the IBM manuals I downloaded has detailed (pictorial) instructions;
I had not looked far enough back in the pdf file the first time. There's a
single screw well hidden under a black rubber cap immediately to the left of
the lights along the top of the keyboard frame. I never saw that one.

   It's all off now so I'll order the replacement and then get it all back
together so it works. Sometimes that's more challenging than pulling to get
it apart.

Thanks to all of you,

Rich

Getting it back together is another thing entirely.

Of course, the title "The Last Thinkpad Screw" would also apply to IBM 
selling the company to the Chinese...

Subject: [PLUG] What is softirq?
Message-ID: <BAY108-F4E1148E91C6269F6A8FFFB8940@phx.gbl>

Hi:

Recently, I brought up to athlon64 box.  They both run great (most of the 
time).
The slower of the two, however, seems to be exhibiting some weird
behavior at times.  They are all sorts of them here and there
and I am slowly tackling one at a time.

This one, however, is a little odd for me.
When I run top,   I can always see that under "CPU states", the "softirq" 
category always
hovers around 50% usage.  Even when I am not running anything (other than
what is minimum to have the box running), it would be 50% idle and 50% 
softirq.
I don't see this on any other boxes so I am wondering what is special about 
this.
Can someone tell me what is softirq?

I am running kernel 2.4.21-32.EL  64-bit version

Thanks for any tip/pointer.

Does that mean that the keyboard still had problems after reseating the

   However, I bet that it's a Good Thing for customers because the Chinese are
more interested in selling quality hardware than IBM was.

softirqs are software interrupts, used often by device drivers to do
further processing of something outside of the hardware interrupt
handler, which needs to run as fast as possible so interrupts can be
re-enabled.  Perhaps you have some rogue hardware?  Does
/proc/interrupts show something going crazy?  Is the box receiving a
lot of network traffic?  Anything in your logs?

I found this guy's posting, perhaps you should try the "noapic" option
to see if that fixes it, then file a bug with RedHat.

galen,

   The connections were tight. I'm not going to futz with reassembly until the
replacement keyboard comes on Friday.

I'd like to point out that this has not ruled out a faulty connection 
due to corrosion.

I've had video cards and other components that stopped working... Until 
I removed that component from the slot and reinserted it back into the 
same slot. The same happens with socketed ICs.

You probably should still try to get the problem fixed, since running

I'm sorry to trouble all of you for an answer to a silly question.

Is there an automated way for a DNS master to tell a DNS slave "now ask me
for this new domain, so you can be authorative too" when a new domain is
configured on the master?

I'm looking at two servers, one of which does an automatic hosting sort of
thing and uses some scripts to create the named.conf file and the entries in
/var/named/ . It needs to share this information with some slaves.

While I can create a fairly trivial set of scripts to communicate the new
domain back and forth, I'm sure this wheel has been invented before.

I eagerly await your discussion.

When the zone is reloaded, say through `rndc reload` the master will
sent an alert to the secondaries with the new serial number.  Note the
secondaries are under no compulsion to do anything about the matter.

I haven't seen anything in bind that will do this. There are probably 
automated scripts out there, but that would be pretty site specifc I 
would think.

Actually, Russ wants the slave to create a NEW zone when the Master is 
configured for one. Not just transfer existing zone files.

Unless there's a mechanism in there that I'm not aware of (entirely 
possible)..

BIND zone transfer protocol only transfers information for zones that have
already been configured at both ends. It does not have a way to
instruct/request a server to become authoritative for a new zone. You'll
have to do this out of band.

If you have administrative control of your slaves, why not forget about
zone transfers and push everything out to the slaves - including new
configuration information?

It has. It's scp.

You and YAR (heh) have the right of it. 
Basically, we have one host ( configured as a DNS master ) where new domains
can be created with users purchasing domains and hosting options. When a new
domain is created, it creates the master entry on this server, but I need to
notify the slaves that there is indeed a new domain for which they need the
configuration file.

Ed, are you suggesting ( below ) that I use scp to copy the domain info
between the DNS servers and not use the master/slave routine? I thought that
this was what DNS master/slave stuff was for- whether or not one had
administrative control over the servers ( I can see that it'd be easier for
people who have one or the other ).

The issue is that /etc/named.conf needs to be modified to indicate the
secondary has that role for the new domain.

Once the domain is defined on the secondary, information about it is
automagially transferred from the primary.

Yes. Why be stuck using an antique, protocol-specific file transfer
protocol, when a much nicer and more secure generic protocol (SSL/scp)
can be used. Plus, your application is crying out for push - not pull.
BIND is pull-oriented.

Besides, you have to move more than zone files to your slaves - you have
to update configuration files - something that BIND zone transfers doesn't
provide for. If you're going to roll your own stuff for the configuration,
handle the zone files as well.


  I thought that
> this was what DNS master/slave stuff was for- whether or not one had

The only time you MUST use BIND's zone transfer protocol is when
your slave servers are not under your control and you can't convince
the administrators to let you scp your zone files. Otherwise, BIND
servers don't really care how their zone files are updated. Of course,
if you do update your BIND zone files using scp, you'll have to signal
BIND that you've done this so it can reload them. While you could use
BIND 9's rndc program to signal BIND, I would just use ssh for that.

Hi Ed,

Just to understand the idea, are you thinking disable zone transfers for 
security and fully synchronize using something like SCP to copy directories?

Why this should always be a process that goes through some kind of approval?

Because BIND has had a terrible track record and having information 
cascade to your slaves could spread the problem.

This is also why it's suggested to not run the master server as a listed 
DNS for the domain. Along with that, cache poisoning can be mittigated 
by hiding the master.

Sorry to take so long getting back and saying thanks.

Turns out all that was needed was a Win95 reboot -- go figure eh?  The

changed the SAMBA setup to require(/use) encrypted passowrds.

Thanks to all for the pointers and ideas.

We have two discussions interwoven in this thread. The first is how to
tell a remote server that it must now handle (be authoritative for)
additional zones (domains). The second is replacing BIND's zone transfer
protocol with something else. I've suggested a way to handle both, but
it may be confusing so let's focus on the second - replacing the BIND
zone transfer protocol. Understanding this will make understanding
the first task easier.

Suppose you have three DNS servers running BIND now. Suppose one is
configured to be the master of all your zones. The other two servers
are configured as slaves. You have administrative control over all
three servers - you can change BIND configuration files, you can
install scripts, you can run ssh, scp, etc. You might be root on all
three.

The general idea is to reconfigure the two slave servers so they are
masters for all the zones. The exact same zone files can be used on
all three servers. Use scp to securely push the zone files from the
"master" to the other masters. Whenever you make changes to any zone
file, send that zone file to the other two servers using scp. Automate
this however you like - a Makefile, a script, etc.

Whenever you update a zone file you must tell BIND about it so it
can reload it. With BIND9, you do something like "rndc reload...".
Your makefile or script will do this for all three servers. You'll
pass these commands to ssh for the two remote servers.

You no longer have to remember to update zone serial numbers - unless
they server a purpose for your administrative needs.
The changes take place immediately. You can turn off BIND features
that are no longer necessary, like NOTIFY.

Getting back to the original poster's task of having remote DNS
servers become aware that they must be authoritative for new
zones:

Whenever you update the master's configuration file to add or delete
zones, you push the modified configuration file to the two remote
servers and send them the command (via ssh) that forces BIND to reread
its configuration.

DNS doesn't have to be as mysterious and complicated as the
DNS priesthood have made it.

It seems like rsync over ssh would be more efficient (assuming it is 
available on both systems), and would also work better if you are 
pushing a directory which may have had files deleted.

  rsync --rsh=ssh -a --delete ...

Sure. It's what I do. I was trying to keep it simple.
Greater efficiency can also be achieved by using something
other than BIND.

Now, for the question you really asked.  Unfortunately, Garmin doesn't have
any kind of custom map utility and hasn't published the specs of the
MapSource format.

There are third parties out there who have developed the ability to load
custom maps into various Garmin units, though. These are not authorized or
supported by Garmin in any fashion, but you might conduct an Internet search
on the topic, via some search engine like Yahoo! or Google.

These are a couple I've run into...NOT an endorsement or a recommendation in
any way...but I have seen the websites, if you want to look:

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0509230833590.12528@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   What is the stability status of the 2.6 kernel series? I just learned that
Emperor Linux now supports only this series, and not the 2.4 series. Patrick
is still keeping the 2.4 kernels in the main distribution, with 2.6 as an
option.

   I have no desire for being on the bleeding edge (or, cutting edge if you
prefer). I need to upgrade my Sony Vaio notebook from 2.4.24; all other
machines here are currently running 2.4.29. I have neither esoteric hardware
or demands on the hosts: there are two workstations (one of which is also the
main server) and two portables.

   What kernel (built here from source) would you experts recommend for my
Slackware systems? Emperor Linux will work with me to get the Sony features
working if they don't do so out of the box with a 2.6 kernel build.

   Then, I suppose, when I get the Slackware-10.2 upgrade I'll move the other
three hosts to the 2.6 kernel.

TIA,

Rich

Good for them.

Well, 2.6.0 was released as a "stable" kernel Dec 18, 2003.  The OSDL
has been happily running 2.6 on its production systems ever since.

I'm sure you've heard a lot of guff about new development models
making 2.6 less stable.  What's happened, as far as I know, is that
development has moved into patched versions that are *based* on 2.6.
If you're running mainline 2.6, it's stable.

If you're running laptops, you should've moved to 2.6 long ago; the
driver and power-management support are greatly improved.  If you're
running servers, you should've moved to 2.6 long ago; the network and
filesystem performance are both much better.  If you're doing compute-
intensive stuff, you should've moved to 2.6 long ago; the new CPU
schedulers are great, and the x64 and hyperthreading support is nice.

Built from source? Newest 2.6.  I'd start playing with a 2.6.14pre
version because 2.6.14 should be out soon.  Any version from 2.6.10 up
is pretty good.

But heck, if you're running a decently-maintained distro, just
use the latest precompiled kernel from that.  It's tested, and the
ACPI and sonypi drivers should be good enough.  You'll need the new
module-init-tools, is all.

Can't wait for 2.7,
  Aaron

Aaron,

   Yes, it is the lack of a 2.7 development tree that I've read is the issue.

   The problem is not with the desktops, or even the ThinkPad; the Sony has
custom-built kernels that EL provides in only rpm format. The rpm2tgz
conversion utility doesn't work properly on the kernels and modules.

Thanks for the advice,

Rich

Just because the development kernel is not named "2.7" at the moment
doesn't mean that 2.6 is unstable.  Mainline kernels with even numbers
(e.g. 2.6) are officially stable.

Just for laffs, try a stock Slackware 2.6 kernel.  The drivers you
need should be included, no custom kernel needed.

The way I read it currently (as of a LKML post earlier this year) is
that 2.6.x are considered the "development" release, those with
another dot-release are the bugfixed/patched version of that.

2.6.13 - "development"
2.6.13.2  - current "stable" (until 2.6.13.3)

Eli, Aaron, et al.:

   Please, let's not get wrapped around the axle on this, for the details are
not of interest to my needs.

   What I would greatly appreciate from those of you with much more kernel
knowledge than I have is just _which_ 2.6.x kernel I should install for a
stable, production, I-don't-want-to-pay-attention-to-it machine.

   I'll try to get to doing something with the notebook this weekend, but I
must get my boat finished so I can put it up for sale. That's the highest
priority for non-work time. The Sony will keep working with the 2.4.24
kernel.

Thanks,

Rich

  Overall, the 2.6 kernel is *so* much better than the 2.4 tree that
you should run it, if you are able.  The 2.6 kernel is chock full of
"really neat stuff"(tm).

  From a practical standpoint, if your computer is running an old 2.4
based distro, then stick with a 2.4 kernel.  If you *need* a feature
or support that's only found in the 2.6 kernel tree, then upgrade your
machine to a 2.6 based distro.

  The pain and suffering involved in stuffing a 2.6 kernel into 2.4
based distro isn't worth the effort IMHO.  You can't just swap out the
kernel.  A lot of API and device driver stuff also changed.

I'd just note that for me, it was simply a case of installing the
right module tools (module-init-tools), an unremarkable aptitude
upgrade and a vanilla 2.6.x compile.  If your distribution made it
painful, you have my sympathies (even if it is hard to believe anyone
would choose to live like that! ;-).

2.6.13 is not regarded as one of the more stable ones, but it is all a
matter of perspective.  SuSE uses 2.6.5 with a bunch of custom patches
for their enterprise line.  RedHat uses 2.6.9 for their enterprise
line.  Ubuntu uses 2.6.10.  Fedora (what I use) follows the current
mainline kernel fairly closely, except that they are avoiding 2.6.13
for the moment.

The kernel summit this summer addressed the perceived problem of
stability, based on the fact that kernel development is screaming
along at an incredible pace now with so many companies contributing. 
Basically, there's only two weeks after a stable release in which
Linus will accept new features from now on.  After that the kernel
hackers are (supposed) to devote time to testing and bugfixes.  See
http://kerneltrap.org/node/5500.

You (presumably as an end user) should be tracking one of two kernel
sources:  the distribution kernel for your distribution, or the
"stable" kernel series (i.e. 2.6.13.2 or something else in the 4-digit
version numbers).  The main reason is to get bugfixes and security
updates, something you're a little behind the times on if you're still
running 2.4.24.  If you really despise 2.6 kernels, at least stick
with the latest 2.4 kernel, since they are really not changing very
much anymore except for bugfixes and security updates.

Based on your "I-don't-want-to-pay-attention-to-it machine" statement,
I think you should use a distro kernel.

Jason

Steve,

   AFAIK, Slackware-10.1 works well with either kernel series. I've no
problems with the 2.4.29 on the two desktop machines or the ol' ThinkPad. The
Sony notebook could use an upgrade so I will go to the 2.6.x series for that.
Apparently, it's the WiFi card driver and ancillary tools that will be the
issue. But, the card is supported by EL (or, at least, it was) so they should
be able to help out on the upgrade.

   I have plenty of this already; I don't need to generate more.

Thanks,

Rich

Is anyone using the serial console for more than the occasional 
fix-of-last-resort? Since servers are presumably networked via Ethernet, why 
would you routine server administration over a poky ole serial line?

Plus I eavesdropped shamelessly on a conversation about updating a Fedora box 
via the serial console, and it took an entire weekend. Yet the person who did 
it thought it was the greatest thing since twist-tops. Soooo... again, if 
Ethernet is working, why would do you this?

Because, sometimes your ethernet isn't working, and this might be a
headless box in a datacenter or similar. Or your ethernet is working,
but you killed sshd in the latest upgrade. Or...

Couple of examples of why I've done it:

#1 You're using LinuxBIOS and never have local console on the
cluster/system, if you're not booted multiuser or networking is down
this is the only way.

#2 You're responsible for said systems, and something goes wrong while
you're NOT seated in the datacenter.  Without being able to get access
on the system, your choices for troubleshooting are severely limited
(think: you're on a ski vacation, or, you're not SUPPOSED to be on a
ski vacation but you are ;)

#3 Nothing is wrong with your system, but instead your network
hardware.  Without any access through you might not even be able to
determine if it was a PDU outage, a switch/router failure, a breaker
trip, etc.

Serial access is only something you think about when you don't have
it.  If you do, you can  find a way to solve a problem.  If you don't
have it, you will immediately see the need when the time comes. 
Obviously you don't plan on needing it, but there's ALWAYS Murphy's

I've got most of my rack-mounts connected to a Digi CM 16, which 
provides serial console support.

Why do I use serial consoles?

1. I can replumb network connections -- or kill and completely restart
    sshd -- remotely.

2. I can reboot the machine remotely. Both grub and lilo will send
    output to ttySx if asked nicely.

3. One strand of cat-5 going to the serial port makes for a cleaner
    server room than a big (or three-fold) KVM cable.[1]

4. For SPARCs -- yeah, they're still around -- serial administration
    is actually easier than a full keyboard-mouse-monitor setup.
    (The same is true for Alphas, but I don't have any. Sniff.)

That said, I'd never do "routine server administration" over a serial 
line if Ethernet is available...

Yes, that's what you asked, and here's what I said before:

Built from source? Newest 2.6.  I'd start playing with a 2.6.14pre
version because 2.6.14 should be out soon.  Any version from 2.6.10 up
is pretty good.

But heck, if you're running a decently-maintained distro, just
use the latest precompiled kernel from that.  It's tested, and the
ACPI and sonypi drivers should be good enough.  You'll need the new
module-init-tools, is all.  

Just for laffs, try a stock Slackware 2.6 kernel.  The drivers you
need should be included, no custom kernel needed.

BTW, what did your vendor say?  How about Google?

Nobody here's paid to do this,

My standard device of choice is a Cisco 2511 (16 ports) or 2509 (8 
ports) with the appropriate octopus cable and connectors.  Very, very 
simple to set up and has "reasonable" security and features.  It's 
big problem is the lack of scrollback buffers, but typically I don't 
care about scrollback buffers and just need to reboot the machine or 
tickle the BIOS.  I only get machines that have serial BIOS control 
(i.e.: SuperMicro.)  There are certainly many other solutions (see 
the advertisements in SysAdmin magazine for a slew of them) but the 
Cisco stuff is pretty easy to get one's hands on and simple to set 
up.  See Google.

I use it just as much for non-PC applications, such as to other 
network gear or components which have serial port craft/console port 
access.

Price: ~$250 on eBay.

Hey, don't disparage those fixes-of-last-resort.  When the pager wakes
you at 3AM, would you rather go clickity-click at your home computer
and go back to bed, or get dressed and drive to the data center?

"Me too" to what Eli and Paul have said.  When I worked there, serial
console was a _must_ at OSDL, both for the production and for the
systems we made available to folks.  You'd be surprised how much nicer
it is to be able to remotely* work on a system without worrying about
its network and sshd falling out from under you.

Another quite valuable thing was that you could capture kernel-panic
and other console messages, and perform Magic SysRQ spells.  The
kernel-hackers appreciated that.

If you have several serial-console systems, Conserver is quite
valuable.  It logs console output and suchlike.

Oh, and remote power-control is the natural complement to
remote-console.  APC makes some nice IP-enabled PDUs.


*For OSDL's purposes, "remotely" means "from anywhere in the world you
can get an Internet connection".

One note on the specifics this reminded me of:

The Cyclades units I've been using (ACS series) have quite large
configurable console buffers by default (several hundred K). This is
really handy when some system goes down, isn't addressable on the
network and you can console in and get your kernel panic... when your
issue is being caused by either a kernel bug or hardware issue that
doesn't give you the luck of remote or pretty output, capturing that
console dump/bluesmoke output is well worth it... cutnpasting it is
even better :) They also let you configure an NFS mount point (or I
believe syslog) to write console to as well.  Their PDU's integrate
directly with the ACS servers and are controlled by hotkeys from the
same interface.

Not to paint a super-pretty picture, they're costly as hell and
dealing with the internals is a bit odd.  Think of it this way tho, a
few grand total added on as infrastructure cost spread among 32-48
systems isn't bad at all.  It'll save you that few grand several times
over in manpower/travel/downtime production/prozac costs.

   2.6.13 comes in /testing in the just-released Slackware-10.2. When I do the
upgrade I'll add that kernel in addition to the 2.4.31 (as a fallback).

   I was not suggesting that you did not offer your opinion before, but I was
responding to another's message.

Sure, but I don't think that what Carla's asking about. I'm sure many of
us have run into situatiosn where we've needed to access a serial console,
but I certainly wouldn't do my routine administration over one if I could
get to the box via ethernet...

The Cyclades units are the unix systems of serial consoles: you can do 
just about anything with them. I was completely blown away at all the 
configuration options on those things.

The Digi CM units aren't nearly as flexible, though they certainly 
handle standard console setups just fine. I ended up ordering the Digi 
because I've had good prior experience with the company's products, 
it's got Linux under the hood, and it was ca. $1000 cheaper than the 
Cyclades. (I got it on sale from Dell for a few hundred dollars below 
retail price.)

Aren't the Cyclades embedded Linux systems too?

Because, sometimes your ethernet isn't working, and this might be a
headless box in a datacenter or similar. Or your ethernet is working,
but you killed sshd in the latest upgrade. Or...

I worked for a company that did just that, designing an in-house
networked serial concentrator to avoid having to purchase equipment to
manage its clusters.  When you get right down to it, unless you
literally have nothing better to do with your time (which probably
isn't the case, or you wouldn't mind driving in at 3am :), it's much
easier just to pay for a finished product, even if it's the cheapest
one on the market.

Have a good weekend all, cheers!

I guess I might be the odd one out, but sshd is *easy* to deal with while
merely having the ethernet connection. As long as you only kill the
listening process, your session continues to exist and as long as you
verify you've restarted it you're pretty safe. This is what the init
scripts will do, logging users out isn't the job of sshd or its scripts.

At the same time, very useful for doing things with ifconfig.

Nope.  In fact on my Linux hosts I don't even use it for that since my
experience has been if the linux host is so screwed that you need the
serial port, the serial port isn't working either.  Instead I rely on
dedicated remote-access hardware such as the Dell Remote Access
Controller or HP/Compaq Integrated-Lights-Out card.  These have proven
to be a reliable way to get into a server that's having issues once
they've been set up properly.

If that hardware is too expensive, then perhaps the server doesn't
need that level of availability.

Can't-Leave-Work...

I've even had to upgrade SSL and SSH without rebooting... remotely... 
It's possible if you start up another sshd on a nonstandard port, stop
the init'd one and do your dirty-work.

Way OT there, I think to answer the original question I wouldn't use
sercon either as long as you have another option.  No more than I'd
use a 300-baud modem just cuz I had it around...

Running the Red Hat installer interactively via serial-console?  I've
done that lots.

Doubt it took all weekend because of the serial, though.  Takes a few
minutes when it's fully automated.

Another use for a serial console is when you are debugging hardware or
perhaps testing a driver.  Frequent resets and power cycles make a
serial connection much more attractive than the network.

Much easier than that. Unless you've got a badly written script that
kills all sshd processes, instead of merely the daemon, why do you need
a second sshd?

In fact I've written and tested a script ment to redo an sshd
installation, while connected via ssh. As long as you keep a spare live
ssh session, it is pretty hard to lose it.

I don't know why it took so long, I assumed it was the slow speed of the 
serial link. But maybe it was learning process.

Thanks all, I always like to check in with the real world.  (And PLUG too.) To 
me it's always been a backup option, not my main server administration tool.  
It has been a butt-saver more than once, including dialing in directly from a 
far-away hotel room. 

I have used the PC Weasel to give plain old cheapie x86 PC servers more 
Unix-like serial features. Pretty slick when you need it.

Running the Red Hat installer interactively via serial-console?  I've
done that lots.

Doubt it took all weekend because of the serial, though.  Takes a few
minutes when it's fully automated.

Ok..

I am going to ask the dumb question..

How do  I make this serial console connection?

I realize my dial up connection is coming out my serial connection 
via  RS232C and a modem...

I don't know how to log into my computer via the serial/com port..

Someone hit me with the smart stick..Point me to a url..

Usually (in my experience) with a null-modem cable from another
machine.  The null-modem cable (minimally) swaps transmit and receive
lines so that one machine's transmit connects to the other machines
receive and vice versa.  Often, and perferably, the null-modem cable
provides lines to do hardware flow control as well.  You can run
minicom on the serial port of the "supervisor" machine.  The
"supervised" machine runs a getty (in /etc/inittab) on its serial port
to provide a login prompt.

There is also some magic you can do with grub, to let you select
kernels to boot, etc.  The kernel needs to have compiled support for
serial console to see the boot up messages live.

I am sure there is a HOWTO (or equivalent) online somewhere.

Subject: [PLUG] OpenBSD on Portables?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0509241121450.28841@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   As my old Toshiba Portege 3025CT has no resale value, I'd like to replace
the Slackware it's now running with OpenBSD and use it for a lightweight
communicator and writing machine when I'm away from the office.

   The official OpenBSD on Laptops web site does not list this model. I find
other Toshibas (including the Libretto L70 and a Portege 2000) so the OS
should install and run on this model.

   However, I have not found anything -- yet -- on the web or in my OpenBSD
book that suggests what should be installed on a portable rather than on a
workstation or server. And, what services should be configured for a box that
would be used both on the office network and stand-alone.

   Pointers to suggestions are welcome. This is a low-priority project for me
so if it takes a few months that's perfectly OK.

FWIW, Slackware has been 2.6-ready since 9.1 or so.  Maybe 10.0?  I forget.

Anyway, all you have to do with recent Slackware releases is drop in a
2.6 kernel.  Either your own or one of Pat's.

I'll be in the market for a laptop in the next month or so and will want
to run Linux on it (dual boot with Win XP Pro).

I've heard that IBM Thinkpads are a straightforward install with Linux,
whereas Dell's laptops are nice but difficult to set-up drivers for Linux.

Distro of choice will be Mepis and I'd like to hear some stories of
Linux on some of the more modern laptops.

Feel free to e-mail directly.

   Google is your friend:

                          <http://www.tuxmobil.org/>
                        <http://www.linux-laptop.net/>

   I've installed linux on an old Gateway, Toshiba Libretto L70, Toshiba
Portege 3025CT, Sony Vaio PCG-V505BC, and a ThinkPad 600E. They've run
various versions of Red Hat (up to 7.3) and Slackware (from 8.0-10.1). Each
has done everything _I've_ wanted them to do. YMMV.

Happy buying,

Rich

Buy a Gateway.  Gateway 675XL (17" widescreen) with onboard wireless.  
Works perfectly in all respects.

I got the accidental damage protection, next business day on-site 
service.  On Tuesday I get a new notebook as my video has some issues.  
With a laptop, it's not IF it will break but WHEN.  With a 3 gigahertz 
P4 hyperthreading, it will be functional for a LONG time.  PAY FOR THE 
WARRANTY.

The warranty was an extra $500.  I've already gotten a new DVD burner 
($459) and now the whole replacement.  Have had it 11 months.  I am 
covered if I drop it, run over it, get it wet, anything.

Not to mention I have the ability to put up to  3 hard drives in it at 
one time.

RP,

   Just curious, RP, how much weight are you toting with this unit?

   Despite the comparatively low power, memory, and hard drive space of my
Toshiba Portege, it weighs only 2 pounds and is less than an inch thick. It's
really nice when I need to carry it for a long time. My 1992-vintage Gateway
weighed 7 pounds. I soon came to hate carrying it on trips or to conventions.

Does it?  I've never met a happy Gateway customer before...

I've had this sorry old Inspiron 2650 for nearly three years now.  It's
been across the country and back.  I've dropped it, kicked it, tripped
over it, yanked on the poor power cable more times than I'd care to
remember.  One time something started eating all the CPU, causing a lot
of heat - with the CPU vent covered.  The CPU hit 88C before I caught
it.  It fried the Wifi adapter I'd purchased for it a few months earlier.

Yet the thing keeps on ticking.  I've had similar experiences with
Toshiba laptops.  Some friends still have the first 486 Mom purchased
nearly a decade ago... nothing has had to be replaced (except the
battery, of couse) on it yet.  The second one she purcahsed had a hard
drive die on it, but has otherwise worked flawlessly.  That was a PII.
Her latest one died about two years after purchase after a glass of
water was dumped on it.

So what you're saying is... pay an extra $500 for the warranty if you
buy a Gateway, because the optical drives won't last a few months and
the entire system won't last a year without replacement?  That's what I
keep hearing about Gateway - low quality systems that don't last...

That's nice, but how portable is it?

My wife also has a Gateway, and while she doesn't run Linux on it, she
loves the thing.  The only complaint I have the the *BRIGHT* blue

I'm currently dual-booted Gentoo Linux and Windows XP home on a Compaq 
Presario 2110 US (1.6 GHz Athlon XP). Most of the time it runs Linux; at 
some point when I run out of more interesting things to spend money on I 
might get VMWare Workstation for Linux and make the Windows part 
virtual, since I rarely run Windows.

I also have an ancient Toshiba Satellite 2595CDT with a 400 MHz (P2) 
Celeron. It was dual booted Window 2000 Professional and Red Hat until I 
got the Compaq, at which point I converted it to Debian. It's running 
Sarge at the moment, mostly because the hard drive is too small for Gentoo.

I think you can actually buy Thinkpads and some Dell laptops with Linux 
on them from the factory!

I have a Dell Inspiron 1100, currently dual booting Win XP Pro, and Suse 
10 beta. I have installed other flavors of Suse and Debian. The only 
problem  I have had is getting the PCMCIA 3COM 11g card to work with 
linux of any kind. But I believe that to be the card itself. If you set 
your system with a fat filesystem in one partition, you'll be able to 
access whatever is in there from either OS.

I've been running a Dell Inspiron 6000 I got from Costco and it's worked 
pretty well with SuSE 9.2 on it. I plan on upgrading it to SuSE 9.3 as time 
permits. It came with 512MB of memory and an 80GB hard drive, modem, Intel 
Centrino WIFI, and Broadcom wired ethernet port.

Pros:

Seems that the hardware on like video, sound, network, WIFI are all supported 
by Linux. With the Linux source installed I upgraded to a newer version of 
the ipw2200 driver and firmware from Intel. I used WPA at home to secure my 
WIFI network and use "wpa_supplicant" on my laptop. Allows me to connect to 
AES or TKIP encrypted WIFI networks.

Came factory installed with XP Pro which I still need for some things like 
Visio for work.  The SuSE installer had no problems shrinking down the NTFS 
partition leaving plenty of room for Linux swap and filesystem partitions. I 
also create a FAT32 partition that's several GB's in size so I can share 
files between XP and Linux. SuSE automatically detects and mounts the NTFS 
partition read-only for itself so I can read any files from Windows but to 
get files into Windows I need the FAT partition as an exchange area.

Linux seems to be able to control the CPU cycles on the 1.60GhZ Pentium M on 
this laptop. For non-CPU intensive usage like email and web the CPU runs at 
800MHZ but kicks up to the full 1600MHZ when I compile C++ or Java code or do 
other CPU intensive work.

Battery life with a 9 cell battery is pretty decent and I've had this laptop 
running for 4 1/2 hours straight before. Didn't get a low battery warning but 
that's been the longest usage time I've had on the battery so far. YMMV and I 
was mostly just doing email and web access so the CPU was probably running at 
800MhZ to save power.

Cons:

The Intel 915GM chipset for the video wasn't supported by the version of Xorg 
that SuSE 9.2 shipped with. IIRC SuSE 9.2 shipped with Xorg 6.8.1 and I 
needed 6.8.2 to get X working with something other than the Framebuffer 
support. Once working I've got X at the full 1280X800 resultion with 24 bit 
color depth. SuSE had a set of RPMs for X.org 6.8.2 for SuSE 9.2 so it was 
easy getting X upgraded.

The onboard video is intergrated into the mobo and is limited to 8MB of 
memory. Still for office application, email, web and 2D graphics it's more 
than adequate. I saw the laptop also had better graphics available but it was 
using ATI and I wasn't sure if ATI on a laptop would have good drivers or 
not. I did have a work issued Dell inspiron that had an nVIDIA 5200 and it 
was great with the accelerated driver from nVIDIA but I have no experience 
with ATI. Rather than risk potential video problems I went with the safe 
Intel bet as I knew the X.org X server had driver support for the Intel 915GM 
ship even though SuSE 9.2 didn't ship with that suppport initially.

Resolution is limited to 1280x800 which again may be too limited for some 
users.

The monitor is 15.4" wide and so this laptop may be considered too large for 
many users. I carried it around when I was traveling alot to Chicago and have 
a backpack with a padded compartment. It's much easier to carry with the 
weight on both sholders rather than using a briefcase type of laptop case 
where I'd have the weght on one shoulder. The Costco package also included a 
laptop case but it's a briefcase type which I don't care for.

It's a Dell which may or may not be a problem for many people. I know I had 
second thoughts as my company issued Inspiron with a 3GHZ P4 had no less than 
3 mobo replacements. I attribute the failures to the huge amount of heat that 
P4 and 7200 RPM internal hard drive produced. With the Pentium M in this 
Inspiron 6000 the air blowing out of the system from the fan is never hot. 
I've got a 3 year warranty on this laptop that was part of purchase so at 
least I'm covered for the next few years on getting the unit fixed. 

Sorry my post is so long I didn't plan to be so verbose when I started. :-D

I've recently started using a Dell Latitude D410 with centrino mobile
stuffs, gigabit ethernet, Intel 2200BG wireless, I've been running
Ubuntu Brezy, and aside from a few bugs during development changes as
they come close to release this thing rocks. 1.6ghz Centrino Mobile(up
to 2GHz) with a 2MB cache and 1GB of ram out performs the 2.4GHz PIV w/
1gb ram that I was using before. 2MB L2 cache!!! Plus it's small light
and sexy. "everything" works, acpi suspend, speed stepping, the works.

Having dealt with both dial-up and text terminals (believe it or not
there are some businesses in the area that still rely on these!), I
can't imagine that sticking a multi-port serial card in a box and using
it for a serial console would be that difficult.  Of course, a
rack-mount box and serial card would probably cost enough that it'd
still make sense to buy rather than build.

Not a laptop, but I bought a super-cheap Gateway-branded wifi card that,
after a little research, turned up as a GemTek card with a Prism
chipset.  I had to manually configured the manufacturer IDs, but after
that everything was roses.  (I submitted the IDs too, so recent releases
of the PCMCIA user-land stuff shouldn't even need manual tweaking.)

It's fairly heavy (remember, widescreen, full keyboard including ACTUAL 
number pad, etc.  Holds 2 HDD and a DVD burner or 3 HDD.  You're back up 
significantly with weight.

HOWEVER - I have had 2 problems with this notebook.  The DVD burner (I 
burn a lot of DVDs) went out.  $459 repair.  And currently am having an 
issue with the video card.  $1800 repair.

BUT *********************************
I got the 5 year, next business day onsite service, including accidental 
damage protection.  They are FedExing me a new chassis (everything but 
the LCD) and it costs me $0.  Same with the DVD burner replacement 
(modular slide-in issue).  $0.

The warranty was an extra $500 (normally $900) for that 5-year span - 
will have paid for itself 4 times over and I've only had it a year.  
Remember - accidental damage protection!

A friend of mine 2 days ago just dropped their $2000 Dell notebook and 
smashed it.  The zipper in their briefcase was undone, and it hit the 
concrete.  No warranty - out one brand new notebook.

This computer has a 3 gigahertz DESKTOP P4 with hyperthreading.  Unlike 
95% of the notebooks out there, the processor is SOCKETED instead of 
soldered in.  So if it dies (or I want to upgrade) - then guess what?  
NO ISSUES.

Mine ran about $3000 (I have 2 gigs of RAM, 2 80 gig HDD) with the 
warranty, and I have never been happier.  FOUR USB 2.0 ports (Dell's 
comes with one), Firewire, full numeric keypad, and did I mention the 
widescreen?  I used to have 2 LCD monitors (18" and 19") on my desktop 
machine - this is all I need now.  I can fit my entire office into my 
briefcase - computer, printer (Canon i80) and scanner (Canon i35).  The 
wider softside leather notebook briefcase ran about $75 at Best Buy. 
(Targus)

It is SO worth it to get a full notebook system with warranty.  At 3 
gigahertz, I can run ANYTHING I need, including graphics software under 
an emulator, or virtual machine - absolutely anything.  Do your research 
and find out what features you want.  I wanted:
widescreen
full keyboard
numeric keypad
gigabit ethernet
b/g wireless
4 USB ports for:
    full-size mouse
    printer
    scanner
    thumb drive
DVD burner (rewriteable even)
WARRANTY
firewire
BRIGHT, SHARP screen (best on the market is Gateway's)

There was only one choice for me.  YMMV, but I have never been sorry I 
got this machine, and I now don't own any desktop machines.

I'm fairly hard on my equipment, traveling a lot.  I also have 2 power 
supplies - one for the office, one for the living room.  Makes life easier.

I have also had Dell and Toshiba equipment - they fail just like 
anything else.  The Gateway (yes, heavier) IS portable, but it DOES 
more, too.  I don't know many notebooks that will allow you 3 drives at 
once.  I handle a lot of data.

The warranty IS worth it.  EVEN IF IT IS MY FAULT I am covered.  That 
means dropping it, spilling liquid, forgetting it's on the roof of one's 
vehicle (happened to several friends), etc.  FOR FIVE YEARS.

Dell's & Toshiba's warranties aren't as good.  If you're getting a $500 
notebook it might not be worth the extra money to some.  Mine ran $3000 
by the time I was through, but 3 gigahertz will STILL be fast in 5 
years.  Notice that clock speeds no longer double every 18 months like 
they used to.  I doubt we'll have 24 or 48 gigahertz machines in 5 
years.  Lucky if we have 10 or 15 gig machines by then, seriously.  This 
machine will still be quite serviceable, and will actually take the 
fastest processor on the market today (remember it's a desktop socket), 
so choosing the platform can be very wise.

A friend of mine works for Dell tech support, supporting warranty 
issues.  His estimation is that notebook drives last right about 12 
months on average.  Should pay for my warranty about once a year then, 
by that alone.  Seeing as I burn DVDs extensively, that will be quite 
worth it alone.

If you are uber-careful and don't ever break anything, fine.  Most 
people aren't.  I spend at least 8 hours a day on the computer, 
sometimes more.  I need something more durable.

LOW-end Gateway computers (and a lot of the older desktops) might not be 
so quality.  The 675XL is the finest notebook I've ever used, and I've 
used Apple, Gateway, Dell, Toshiba (close second IMO), IBM (rugged, but 
hard to work on), Panasonic (VERY durable but they break just the same), 
etc.

Can I ask the rather sidetracky question of, "Why?" Is this just to 
learn about OpenBSD? Is this laptop holding exteremely sensitive 
information? Or is there something else I'm missing?

OpenBSD is just not the first *nix that comes to my mind when I think 
about workstations even, let alone laptops. If your thought is that 
OpenBSD will be more "lightweight," that may be true, but any Linux/Unix 
can be installed in a more lightweight fashion.

OpenBSD is great, but there is a pretty small development team (at least 
there was the last tinme I checked), and I think you are more likely to 
run into problems with things like drivers. Maybe everything will be 
covered for an older laptop, but if their site does not list it as 
compatible then I wouldn't assume it's going to work.

If I were installing a laptop, I would go with a Linux distro (Ubuntu 
seems to have a pretty small profile) or even FreeBSD if you are a *BSD 
fan. YMMV of course.

As for services, it depends on exactly what you want to do. It's not 
clear to me from your description, but you might not need any.

However, I cannot find a linux version to download on his web site

Probably be better to use a bunch of USB-to-serial converters, and
cascade a bunch of USB hubs together.  The supervisor machine would
have a big pile of /dev/ttyUSB* devices.

Do those dongles have serial numbers?  If so, udev would do the trick.

It is further down the download page.  You also have to download the 
Windows package to get the docs and demo/sampel data.

On the server with the console redirected to the serial port:

1. List ttyS0 in /etc/securetty

2. Start up a getty on ttyS0 in /etc/inittab. Here's an invocation
    that works for Red Hat/Fedora Core/CentOS:

# serial console
con:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty -h ttyS0 9600 vt100

3. Modify your grub configuration. You'll want to get rid of all
    splashimage and color references. Here's a CentOS version:

serial --unit=0 --speed=9600 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1
terminal --timeout=5 serial console
default=0
timeout=5
title CentOS-4 i386 (2.6.9-11.ELsmp)
   root (hd0,0)
   kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.9-11.ELsmp ro root=LABEL=/1 console=tty0 console=ttyS0
   initrd /initrd-2.6.9-11.ELsmp.img


Connect another machine to that server using a null-modem cable. Fire 
up minicom (or, better, conserver[1]) on the non-server. Reboot the 
server and enjoy life without a locally attached monitor!

A far more complete explanation can be found in TLDP's Remote Serial 
Console HOWTO[2].

On the supervisor machine, I've also set up minicom to run on one of
the virtual consoles (e.g. tty6) like so (from /etc/inittab):

  [...]
  1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1
  2:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty2
  3:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty3
  4:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty4
  5:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty5
  #6:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty6
  6:23:respawn:/usr/bin/openvt -c 6 -w -- /usr/bin/minicom -o -c on serial-console
  [...]

Kind of handy, at least if you've only got a few machines to wrangle.

Circa 2005-09-24 14:34 dixit Rich Shepard:

: As my old Toshiba Portege 3025CT has no resale value, I'd like to
: replace the Slackware it's now running with OpenBSD and use it for a
: lightweight communicator and writing machine when I'm away from the
: office.
: 
: The official OpenBSD on Laptops web site does not list this model. I
: find other Toshibas (including the Libretto L70 and a Portege 2000) so
: the OS should install and run on this model.

Probably.  The biggest source of potential problems is liable to be the
PCMCIA bridge.  I once had to build a custom OpenBSD kernel with
different IRQ/ioport settings for the PCMCIA bridge before it would
install properly on a Sony VAIO PCG-505TR.  You may have difficulty
getting sound to work.

: However, I have not found anything -- yet -- on the web or in my
: OpenBSD book that suggests what should be installed on a portable
: rather than on a workstation or server. And, what services should be
: configured for a box that would be used both on the office network and
: stand-alone.

As far as OpenBSD is concerned, there isn't really much difference
between a workstation and a portable; the biggest difference is that
you'll want to turn on apmd to handle power events (but note that there
is no hibernation support, even in current OpenBSD, only support for
suspend).  Make sure you install the x11 bits to begin with and turn on
the AGP aperture at install time---it's easiest that way.

Does your machine have a builtin ethernet port, or will you be using a
PCMCIA ethernet adapter?  OpenBSD doesn't really have an infrastructure
for dealing with running external commands when devices are
hot-plugged---you'll need to run /etc/netstart when you plug in the
ethernet cable (it'll be easiest to configure it with DHCP).

For services, you might consider installing a trusted DNS cache (such as
the one from djbdns <http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.hmtl>) if you're planning on
connecting to untrusted networks.  Otherwise, make believe it's a
workstation, and turn on, say, sshd.  If you want to change profiles
between office and standalone (e.g., say you want to mount an NFS share
while connected to your office network), then you'll want to create a
script or two to manually start or stop the things you'll need (portmap,
for example).  If all you want to run is sshd, i wouldn't worry about
changing profiles.

Also, note that OpenBSD has support for running, say, lpd and similar
services as local-only.  For example, lpd can be told to listen only on
a Unix-domain socket, and no TCP sockets at all (using the -s flag).

A better idea of the things you'd like to do with the notebook would
help me give you better advice.

: Pointers to suggestions are welcome. This is a low-priority project
: for me so if it takes a few months that's perfectly OK.

I've run OpenBSD as both servers and workstations, and i've found it far
easier to get running the way i want it than most Linuxes.  I don't
think it'll take that long.

Good luck,
jim

Does anyone know javascript?
I don't.

I'm using UMN MapServer and have gotten myself in a position where I have
to use javascript to set a parameter in my return URL.

Normally, I do this by using something like:

               <script language="JavaScript">
               document.main.layer_status_1999.value="PRECIP0";
               document.main.submit();
               </script>

and then this returns something like:
http://www.DavidMandel.com?stateext=US&size=med&layer_status%5B%5D=copyright...
       lots-more- stuff...&layer_status_1999=PRECIP0.

This all works fine!

Unfortunately, in my environment I must use the name: 
               layer_status%5B1999%5D or layer_status[1999]
or other things don't work.

However, every variation of:

               <script language="JavaScript">
               document.main.layer_status%5B1999%5D.value="PRECIP0";
               document.main.submit();
               </script>

that I have tryed BLOWS UP.
It doesn't like these special characters in my name (quoted, escaped, or 
not) and it doesn't like me to use a variable in this position.

Does anyone know a way of handling this problem?
My work around is terrible.

                                          Sincerely,

I'm using these because they do a lot of nice things like
producing legend icons as needed and only displaying the
desired map themes when the map has a reasonable scale and so on.
However, the required syntax is very very restricted.
Like they support an if statement without a else statement!!

My apologies, I may have missasked my question.

Why does the form field need to be named this way:
	layer_status[1999]

The reason that it's bugging out is that in javascript 

layer_status[1999] is automatically trying to retrieve the

Index 1999 from the layer_status array.

Are you trying to dynamically create a form element?

If so, just use the innerHTML object to add it to a hidden div
And use it as a normal form element.

Ie:
<script>
	function createDynamicField(){
		var div = document.getElementById("hiddenFields");
		div.innerHTML = "<input type='text' name='layer_status_1999'
value=''>";
	}
</script>

<div id="hiddenFields" style="visibility:hidden;">

</div>

If that's not what you are doing, ignore the above.

I have extensive JS knowledge, I'll be online most of the evening, so email
Me back exactly why the field name is so important and we can work it out.

Javascript has an alternate object indexing syntax for this sort of 
situation:

  object['property'] = 'value';
  object.property = 'value'; // also valid

  document.main['layer_status[1999]'].value = 'foo';
  something['property with spaces'] = 'baz';

Also useful for variable indexing:

  next = array[++someIndex];
  p = 'quux'; return obj[p];

Best,
Jason

I know this is very strange and this is why it is bugging out.
The problem is that it is getting past back to a program that
wants these to be array elements of an array it is using.
I really wish I could change this, but I can't.
I may end of recoding quite a bit of stuff to get around this.

I need a bit of time to look at what you gave me here before commenting.

Thanks,

   Thanks, Jim. Actually, rationality returned the next day and I acknowledged
that it makes much more sense to update the Slackware installation on this
notebook than futz with a new OS just because I have the book and intended to
build a firewall with OpenBSD. I'm using the Netgear FVS318 firewall
appliance and I don't need an uber-secure OS on the lightweight notebook.

   Besides, I have too many higher-priority needs and none requires a specific
OS.

I'm trying to help a friend with a Motion Computing M1300 Tablet PC,  
loaded with Mandriva 2005 LE and the 2.6.11 kernel. It has a 1 GHz  
Centrino that shows up under WinXP (it's a dual boot system) with an  
Intel PRO/Wireless LAN 2100 3B Mini PCI  wireless connection. It  
works just fine under WinXP.

When I do an ifconfig eth2, I see that it has given me 192.168.0.3. I  
can ping the 0.3 address, but when I try to ping the gateway, I get  
Destination Host Unreachable and ping: sendmsg: Operation not  
permitted, with 1 packet transmitted, 0 received.

This *should* be working, but its not and I don't have a clue as to why.

Suggestions?

I don't know if this will help, but...

When my SuSE 9.1 machine goes down due to power failure, I have to use 
the configuration tool (YaST) to reconfigure the Ethernet interface. The 
first time it happened, I discovered that I hadn't told it to use my 
router as the default gateway. The second time, it knew about the 
default gateway, but I still got the "Network Unreachable" error 
message. When I made it think I had made a change (I changed something, 
but then changed it back, so it thought I had edited the configuration), 
it went through the configuration process and all was well.

One of these days, I'll try to find some time to pursue this. Meanwhile, 
I have the work around.

I am getting sleepy and just wondering about upgrading from Fedora FC3

like to change the /etc/fedora-release file to read the FC4 way and then
do a yum -y update.

This sounds like it **should** work, but must be dangerous.  I could not

Do I use the EIDE HDD with the jumpers set as a master or slave or cable select or

Actually, no, everything I've ever read recommends VERY strongly that
you do an FC3->FC4 upgrade via the installation disks, even if it is a
pain.  You may wish to check out one of the re-spun installation disk
sets to avoid having to start over at FC4 and download all the updates
since then.

http://fedora.isphuset.no/

Work seems to be continuing to integrate yum further with anaconda, so
perhaps FC5 or FC6 will be able to install updates directly...

Well, yes.

If you install windows on the SATA drive it will be C..

Then your older IDE drive will show up as D with all your data


Unless you partition your sata drive..


Which I would..

It is large..

Too large to devote entirely to Windows.....

Just leave the part you don't want to use..

Install Ubuntu later..



Good luck

Let me know if you have more problems..

I found these instructions on the fedora project wiki:

However when I did my upgrade I needed a new disk and installed from DVD I
downloaded via bittorrent so I have never tried this type of upgrade.

As root, look at the output of "route" to make sure that you are routing
packets correctly (that is, through eth2).  Also, check that your firewall
permits the packets (it might pass dhcp packets but not ping).  You may
have to turn off eth1 or eth0 (whatever the normal ethernet connection is).  

Also, try pinging the laptop from the gateway, with tcpdump running on
both ends.

Hope that helps;

Vram,

Worked well after I played around with the BIOS a little.  When I first accessed the EIDE HD,
 I was able to navigate well, but now it's very slow.  And I was able to look into the program 
files folder, but now when I do it says the drive is not formatted.  I can access other folders 
though.  And yes, it's a winduhs box XP

What are your thoughts on this?

Hi Vram,

I have drive C:, wjich is the SATA HD and drive E: is the old EIDE HD. 
Drive D: is a cd burner.  When I first got the box booted up after
installing the old EIDE HD, I was able to access the folders on the EIDE
HD.  Now, I'm unable to access some of the folders on the old drive. 
When I try to open up, for example the program files folders on the EIDE
drive, it says that the D: old EIDE HD needs to be formatted.

Vram,

I replaced the eide cable.  The maxtor 40BG HD is jumpered as a master
and is at the end of the cable.  But I still get the message that Drive
E: is not formatted when I try to open up some of the folders.  I guess
that there is some corruption on this HD.  I tried to fix it using a
utility to id and fix bad sectors, but that program wouldn't run to
completion.

Any other ideas????

Jim

None right off hand..

Is there some mission critical files you MUST have?
For $$$ there are folks who can recover data.

Otherwise...consider yourself SMARTER.  <Won't do that again>

This is what I get on my machine.

  # iwlist  eth1 scan
  eth1      Interface doesn't support scanning : Operation not supported

I have an IBM think pad T30 with builtin wireless.  Using the following 
modules on linux 2.6

  #lsmod
  orinoco_pci             7424  0
  orinoco                42892  1 orinoco_pci
  hermes                  7552  2 orinoco_pci,orinoco

Is there a way I can get scan working?  

I also have the wireless network hang if I do large fast transfers.  When it 
hangs it sucks up a lot of cpu time and have to unload the driver modules to 
get the wireless networking working again.   I find it very annoying.  I was 
putting up with these problems as just yet another set of poor linux drivers.

Can you figure out exactly what card you have? Groking through lspci
should list what the actually mini-pci card is that you have installed.
If it's the Intel 2200BG, which it seems from their website is what
comes installed, you're not going to want to use the orinoco drivers.
Rather you should be using the drivers that support that card
specifically. 

For the 2200 it's the ipw2200 driver with does support scanning. (It
actually seems to be a really great driver, kismet support and great
sensitivity from the card)

http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/

It's packaged with the Breezy Kernels..

Make sure you're using the correct driver for the card you have. I think
that's your first hurdle.

Only if you determine it's a Prism2 based chipset.

Although Acronis TrueImage is installed on a HD under
Windows, the rescue CD created with it uses Linux (but
is not open-source).

I have an ASUS A7N8X-E mobo with an onboard 1394
controller. I suspect it is not recognized by the
rescue CD (and neither is an external HD attached to
it) since the message is:

ohci1394_0: selfID received outside of bus reset
sequence

Since this is a proprietary product, and there are
many backup strategies, I am wondering whether I can
get it working or whether I should try something else.
Can anyone explain the message, in any case?

The T30 uses a few different kinds of card, depending on the model.
My wife's T30 came with a Cisco mini-PCI card.  A very low power
card, like 5mW, and funky drivers.   And it was hard to power
control for plane flights, necessitating use of the Cisco control
panel.  Difficult to switch between our "inner" wifi network (WEPed)
and a public network.  All those things suggested that built-in
wireless - especially Cisco - was not the way to go. 

So we yanked the mini-PCI card and use a $40 200mW Senao/Prism2 card,
which is guaranteed to go off the air when you pull the card, and is
easier to configure for WEP or open connection.  This may seem like a
step backward compared to built-in, but it is actually easier to use.
It worked for three weeks in Sweden and England, at two open/public
sites and two WEPed hotel sites.

The ipw2x00 drivers are F/OSS but still need binary firmware, which
are not supplied with Fedora Core 4 (or Extras) but _is_ in the Livna

bundled w/ the Ubuntu Breezy kernels. You can also just D/L it from

Subject: [PLUG] Network Connection Tools
Message-ID: <433C106C.3040000@comcast.net>

Is there a tool I can use at my end to try to pinpoint a communication 
problem between me and a specific web site?

This morning I was taking an on-line quiz at a site I've been using for 
several months. Over the months, there has always been a variable amount 
of lag between hitting "next" and getting the next question. This 
morning, that lag was substantially worse, although still not consistent 
-- sometimes I'd get the next question almost instantly, other times I 
would wait for 20-30 seconds. Finally, after a particularly long wait, I 
got a time-out error (sorry -- I didn't write it down), and the quiz reset.

I called the provider of the quiz who checked his site logs and saw now 
apparent problems at his end. Our assumption is that the problem is a 
communications delay somewhere in the middle, perhaps with Comcast. 
Thus, the question about how to find that problem.

I like 'mtr' for figuring out where the delays are.

I've seen a 'visual traceroute' for Windog that gives very interesting
views of your routes, but there doesn't seem to be anything like that
for Linux.

Thank you both. I downloaded and installed mtr and ran it. I also ran 
traceroute. No obvious problems show up, nor did I have any trouble with 
the web site in question, so I'm guessing it was a problem that went away.

Now that I have the tools (I had forgotten about traceroute!), I'll use 
them if and when the problem returns.

I'm trying to use perl and a regular expression to find all instances
of "Fred" in a file except for "Fred Flintstone" and "Fred Mertz".
Here's the closest I found, but doesn't quite work:

  /Fred [^(Mertz|Flintstone)]/

It only compares the first letters of Mertz and Flintstone, so it also
filters out "Fred Magoo" and "Fred Meyer". How can I negate a string
rather than a single character?

There are lots of ways to do it.  You could use two regular expressions
and logic in between them.  You could read the perlre manpage and learn
about negative lookaheads.

But using [] builds a character class, and everything inside of it
is used on a character by character basis.  So it will reject Fred
followed by a space and then none of )(|MertzFlinso.

Good luck on your homework,
Colin

read 'perldoc perlre'

You want a negative assertion instead of a character class.

I forgot to give the fix that worked. Turns out shorewall was  
installed misconfigured and blocked all access by eth2 (but eth0 went  
through fine).

The FVS318 is a pretty decent firewall and I say this as someone that has used 
OpenBSD for a number of years now for a firewall at several sites. I've been 
using an FVS318 as a a no fuss replacement for my OpenBSD firewall when I 
need to take the system down for an upgrade of the version of OpenBSD on it. 
I've also worked at a startup and had my non-computer techincal boss put me 
on the stop at CompUSA for a firewall for our office. I picked the FVS318 
since it had the ability to support up to 8 IPSec tunnels which was great 
since we had a few people working offsite.

Due to lack of time I still haven't gotten my firewall deployed with OpenBSD 
3.7 on it so the FVS318 has been running for nearly a month now. :-/  I've 
got my firewall system running, installed all of the core OpenBSD source code  
and I even got all of the source patches applied to my codebase. After that I 
let the system go and recompile everything so I can apply source patches as 
they are released.

OpenBSD is a handful to maintain unless you have some significant time to 
invest getting a system setup so you can apply source code patches and 
recompile the code that was patched. Since I cannot predict what code will be 
patched I compile all of the core code and basically release my own build of 
OpenBSD. It's not too bad with a few shell scripts  to automate the build and 
release process. 

But because of the work involved in setting up an OpenBSD I usually run the 
same OpenBSD version and only upgrade the version of OpenBSD I run once the 
development team no longer releases patches for the version I'm running. I 
have found I can speed up the setup process by keeping my OpenBSD 
configuration files in my own CVS server and so once I have basic network 
connectivity working I just pull my firewall and other configuration files 
out of CVS.
