I was paying attention when you said that before. :) I wanted the new release 
with all the shiny new stuff- new kernel, kernel modules, associated baggage 
like /boot and /etc and /lib and such, and not just a few files. So I 
upgraded the existing installation, and I think it's pretty darn slick to be 
able to do that.

Just trying to draw the distinction between "can" and "have to".  The

                               Bryce Harrington
                               <bryce at osdl.org>
 
      Inkscape is an Open Source vector graphics editor, with capabilities 
      similar to Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDraw, or Xara X using the  
      W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics  (SVG) file format. 
      Supported SVG features include shapes, paths, text, markers, 
      clones, alpha blending, transforms, gradients, patterns, and  
      grouping. Inkscape also supports Creative Commons meta-data, 
      node editing, layers, complex path operations, bitmap tracing, 
      text-on-path, flowed text, direct XML editing, and more. It imports 
      formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and others and exports PNG as 
      well as multiple vector-based formats.

      Inkscape's main goal is to create a powerful and convenient drawing 
      tool fully compliant with XML, SVG, and CSS standards. We also aim 
      to maintain a thriving user and developer community by using open, 
      community-oriented development process, and by making sure Inkcape 
      is easy to learn, to use, and to extend.

Message-ID: <55cf303a0609011429t11a3af7ja9061822b87f8628@mail.gmail.com>

I need to obtain a small cheap UPS that will handle a couple of small
routers for a couple of minutes at a time.

My new house is nice, but the power glitches are starting to get to me.
Every time they hit, I have to deal with manually restarting servers and
routers.  (Which is a pain when I am at work...)

I am looking for something reliable.  My last UPS lated about a year and a
half and then just refused to hold a charge.  (And the batteries cost about
as much as the unit.)

Ideas?

You want cheap AND reliable? Well, what's 'cheap' to you? I'd suggest
that you get a big enough UPS that it does power conditioning. I think
APC does that from 650 up, on the professional (i.e. non-home) models.

I have an old rackmount APC UPS, not very big power-wise but it can run
my network and a lightweight server for about 20 minutes safely. I
bought it refurbished, and have replaced the batteries once in 7 years.

So even though I paid more for it, I'll bet that replacing batteries
every 18 months would make your cost about the same as mine. 

Of course, my wife's PC is plugged into a cheapo UPS, and it has been
far more reliable than I expected it to be, 5 years and counting. 

Pay for quality, or hope to be lucky, I guess.

Subject: [PLUG] Pebble, Pyramid, Puppy, patheticness on my picomachine
Message-ID: <20060902041704.GA13710@couv>


With the recent discussions on Pebble and Pyramid Linux, I wondered how
suitable these were for "generic" x86 hardware (as opposed to an
outright embedded environment).  I have a Neoware thin client with 64MB
IDE flash DOM, it's integrated Rtl8139 (or whatever) 10/100 NIC, and a
PCI slot with a Ralink RT2500-based 802.11g card.  I would like to make
this box into a wireless router/gateway device between my wired lan and
a wireless network.

I have done work on the Neoware boxen in the past, and their
RedHat-derivative NeoLinux is pretty decent, albeit requiring a specific
build environment.  I have an rt2500 driver built for this box that
associates and works, but I have no iptables so it's kind of hard to do
NAT/forwarding/et.al. without it.

I could set up a build environment for the box and hack away, but I was
kind of hoping to get this project running sooner than later.  Do either
Pebble or Pyramid support the rt2500?  I've looked at Puppy too, but a
lot of these small linux distros want to boot from a CD.  The Neobox has
USB, so I could boot from a USB floppy (which I have), but I dont' have
a USB CDROM.  It can PXE boot too--so I could set up some shenanigan
using that.

Basically, it comes down to the fact that I am lazy, er--I have two kids
under two years old, and no time to work on this, and just need it to
work.  Anyone have any Quick Routes to Routing Bliss that should work on
this hardware?

TIA

If you have an existing Linux system then you could use the buildroot
project.  It will build
up a small system that has the packages you configure and does most of
the startup
and configuration of services.  It does have a limitation in that your
Linux box needs
an internet connection as it downloads the needed packages after you
run the config.
If you can work through a kernel build then you can work through the
buildroot.  You
will have to download and build your own kernel also.

The soekris hardware use "generic x86" instructions.  Some of the
hardware Pebble/Pyramid is intended to run on is 486-like and some is
pentium-like.  It ought to work on generic x86 hardware.  I got
Pyramid booting on a Fujitsu Stylistic.

If it helps any, I have written up some of the procedure I used in
hacking on one of our pebble-derived images:

  <http://wiki.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/MississippiMetrixConfiguration>

Not all of the things I refer to are immediately available to the
general public (mostly things locally hacked), but it gives you some
ideas how it can work.  It is mostly my notes on how I got things
working so I can repeat it all after I've forgotten in a week.

If your wireless hardware works in Ubuntu, then you can follow my
general instructions for Pyramid... copying the files needed from an
Ubuntu Live-CD environment.

Just a follow up on this.  Today I finally got the IR189USB cable and
a Fluke 189 together in the same building.  And then, in the last
hour, I got them together in the same room, and lo and behold: it
works!

I had discovered a month or two ago that the IR189USB was likely to
work.  I plugged it into a USB port and it got detected as a pl2303,
which is a well-supported USB/serial converter chip.  I found some
documentation from Fluke on the communication protocol here:

  <http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~thunter/manuals/RemoteSpec89_18X.htm>

and when I type QM into a suitably configured minicom terminal, I get
a reading back out.  Pretty coolsville.

As usual, I discovered some under-reported things in the process.  The
IR link is not some TV-remote like thing, that can beam data across
the room as I had expected.  I wondered how multiple DMMs would be
discriminated in such an environment.  Instead, the Fluke 189 has a
little jig that holds the IR part of the cable directly against the
top of the meter, meaning one-cable/one-fluke189.

But, once I got gpsd to let go of /dev/ttyUSB0 (thank you mr.
/usr/bin/lsof), it works just fine.  Hope this helps someone,
somewhere, sometime.  Yay for the Hands-On Imperative!

Can it boot a USB thumb drive? You can get a *real* distro onto one of

Personally I would try:

We've gotten three larger UPSs from them and quite happy with them.

Alan,

   I have an APC Smart UPS 500 that probably needs a new battery; the
firewall/router was plugged into it and going bonkers one morning until I
switched it to a surge protector. You're welcome to the UPS; Northwest
Batteries on SE Belmont & 37th (I think) has replacement batteries.

   Well, I've had this guy for years and it worked continuously until now.
Probably exceeded the expected battery life.

Okay, maybe I'm missing something, but exactly what advantage does
using IR give you when the IR has to be attached to the meter?

Electrical isolation for one thing.  No extraneous signals messing up

Pinging Russell, or any interested personages.... I meant to follow up on 
the "ick" directed at Bering ucLibc, and was wondering why? I like that 
Pyramid is not modified very much from Ubuntu, which makes it easy for 
non-coding geniuses to hack. On the other hand, Bering uses all kinds of 
modified libs so you get the small size from reduce lib sizes, and it has 
package management. And it has a much prettier web site. :)

Only because, compared to pebble/pyramid, my experience with Bering is
limited to a brush associated with the stock firmware on the Netgear
WGT634U.  It isn't an "ick" you should rely on, just a personal
involuntary convulsion.  Sorry about that.

The stock wgt firmware using a LEAF Bering derived system.  It is
interesting in that the system unpacks itself from tarballs into a
ramdisk as it boots up.  Which is interesting and cool in its own way,
but it does result in a system that takes 2 minutes to boot on the
wgt.  Not sure how much that taints the system you were referring to.

One alternative on the wgt is OpenWgt, which boots in about 15
seconds.  It (iirc) using a jffs2 filesystem.  OpenWrt using a couple
different strategies, one is a combination SquashFS/Jffs2 which boots
in about 30 seconds (the jffs2 file system here is the rootfs and
contains symbolic links into the read-only squashfs tree).

Message-ID: <44FC48F3.9080503@acm.org>

I come across this once many years ago but can't find anything current 
on the web, except in relation to NTFS, so I'm hoping I can get a clue 
from someone on the list.

Suddenly a partition started having write errors ( remote system so I 
haven't seen the actual messages ) and when the system was rebooted it 
came up reporting that fsck needed to be run on the partition.

I helped the remote tech walk through the process and the system 
appeared to be fine but a few hours later it went bonkers again and when 
it was rebooted the partion came up as read-only so the mount point ( 
/var/log ) is none writeable.

I can take the partition out of the loop but I'm hoping it might just be 
my "remote eyes" missed something. :-)

Suggestions, clues?


TIA,
Rod

Have you seen Rollyo?  It's not exactly what you're talking about, but 
it does allow you to create customized searches using only the search 
engines you specify.  So, for example, if you have three or four book 
sites you like to search, you could make a Rollyo that searches all of 
them with one query.  I've seen it embedded in websites and blogs.  You 
can also add it to Firefox.

Your system is exhibiting signs of pronounced defectiveness. All I can
recommend is to get religious about backups and prepare for a new hard
drive and OS install.

Perhaps, if you hurry, you can boot up under knoppix and rsync the load
off to another drive or remote location.  Start with the bits you really
cannot afford to lose.

OK, trying to post the file mailx style to the list didn't work, so I uploaded 
it to madebyai.com. The original file I tried to post to the list can be 
found at 
http://www.madebyai.com/clipboard/get/4761f66996d1e2dbd86b2dc02b6b61d13011ef9844fc7be0.bz2

	Thanks for the help Bruce.

These lines at the very top of the file already look suspicious.  Are
you using a distro kernel?  Try building your own vanilla kernel first.
I'd say your kernel is missing a lot of the stuff that would be there if
you built your own.

OK, I'll try compiling my own kernel using the latest source available from 
the debian package archives.

Rarely; only a limited set that I have expressly whitelisted.

Try installing those packages before compiling your own?

Ack!! Nothing but bad news.  Well I felt it might be this but was hoping 
otherwise.

Thanks to all.  Fortunately it is only the /var/log partition.  I can 
grab the important files ( a mail spool wit hsome enhancements :-) and 
get a new HD installed.

Yeah, using package management is a better solution.  I'm not a debian
guy, therefore I wasn't much help on that front.  Listen to Dave
instead.

When I was a debian guy, though, I always built my own kernel.  Now I
am curious how a vanilla kernel plays with packages such as these
(kernel header type packages, that is).  Would there be conflicts in
/lib/modules/ ?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0609041533030.24836@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   What does the extension .lai mean for a library? I assume that it's some
flavor of a static library, but otherwise I know nothing about it. A Google
search pulls up one hit: a problem installing such a library with Debian on
a 64-bit PPC processor.

Initial googling seems to indicate that libtool creates .lai files during
installs.  Some more links, similar to the one you found:

http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-devel&m=95811214125332&q=raw
http://www.mail-archive.com/libtool at gnu.org/msg08899.html
http://www.handhelds.org/hypermail/oe/50/5004.html
http://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2002-03/msg00438.html

It seems that libtool creates .lai files.  Not sure why.  I can only
find one such file on my gentoo system, and it is in the portage tmp
directory.  I would guess that libtool creates these for in-process use,
but they do not get installed into the libs directory.  Mine is part of
the gnome-cups-manager ebuild.

Here's a link that, while not explaining anything, indicates that .lai
files are really .la files.  It shows 3 examples of an .lai file being
directly copied to an .la file:

It's been my experience that, as long as you match up the modules with
the kernel package, you're fine.  Ie:

linux-image-2.6.17-2-686 and ieee80211-modules-2.6.17-2-686

Carlos,

   That's interesting. I was trying to 'make install' libgnomeprintui and it
failed because it could not find the .lai version. There's a .la version in
the tmp build directory, but not the one make sought.

Thanks,

Rich

Looks like you're in the same sorry boat as all those other people who
lament similarly in their forum posts.  One time, on my gentoo box, I
had to re-emerge libtool for some reason that I have since forgotten (I
don't think it had anything to do with .lai files).  Maybe you might
give this a shot?  libtool is an abstraction layer for hiding the
grotesqueries of a system's linking implementation behind a common API.
Perhaps the implementation has changed on your debian box since the last
libtool upgrade.  You'd think they would have updated libtool if this
were the case, but there are humans in charge of these things.  Perhaps
the testing version of libtool?

Are there any emacs/SLIME hotshots out there?  I would like to ask a
question or two.  Topics include: why can I hit "v" in the debugger and
it takes me to the source of system packages, but not my code?  Why can
I not step through code?  Even if I have (declaim (optimize (debug 3)))
in /etc/sbclrc ?  What do the lisp heavyweights know that I don't (other
than the obvious answer, which is "loads!").  Do I have to compile .fasl
files for my code to be able to step and inspect source?

Hi.

	I have thought more carefully about compiling a vanilla kernel and I've 
decided that it would ultimately be more hassle than it's worth for me, since 
I use debian to get work done, not administer it full-time so that others can 
get work done. Instead, I'll just go spend $20 and get a PCMCIA 802.11 
wireless card that works with linux.

	Thanks for your help anyways, though.

   While it's considered heretical on this mail list to publicly admit to not
running a subspecies of either Debian or Red Hat, that's me. Regardless,
libtool-1.5.20 is installed here.

   Actually, I was trying to save space on the ol' ThinkPad 600E by
installing AbiWord rather than OO.o for my finacee. She needs to process
only words, does not need to read or write .doc files, and so a slimmer,
more focused tool seemed to be the way to go. Alas, AbiWord wants some Gnome
libraries (libgnomeprintui among them) and FreeRock Gnome doesn't happen to
include that particular library. I guess that's the problem with garden
gnomes.

   Well, it was a nice thought, but I just upgraded OO.o to -2.0.3 and let it
go at that.

Thanks,

Rich

I demonstrated poor troubleshooting skills here.  I should clarify.  The
issue isn't emacs or slime, it's SBCL and my lack of knowledge o how to
use it.  I get the same problems in an SBCL image launched from a shell.
The subject of this thread should be "SBCL afficianados?" or "CMUCL
afficianados or derivatives thereof, especially SBCL?"

But who develops lisp code in a shell-launched SBCL when emacs/SLIME is
so much nicer?  So the only place I ever see my issues is in this
environment.  You can see where I made my error in judgement.

When I say "system packages", I mean libraries like cl-sql, cl-ppcre,
cl-uffi, etc.  These are all asdf packages, and they all compile into
/var/cache/common-lisp-controller/.  Gentoo (my distro) uses the same
common-lisp-controller as debian.  Maybe this is the defining difference
between code that behaves correctly in the debugger vs. my code, or maybe
not.  It's one factor to consider.  The other factor is that I do not
compile .fasl files in my project code; I simply load the files into the
running lisp.  Intuition tells me that this should make it easier for the
debugger to find the source for the code in a backtrace because it does
not have to compare source to .fasl, but I may be wrong.

In my project files, I have a "top-level" source file that I load, and
it contains (load "<filename>.lisp") forms that handle the loading of the
next group of files, and they load more files in turn, until all the
files are loaded.  I will experiment with (compile "<filename>.lisp")
followed by (load "<filename>.fasl"), and see if that makes any
difference.

I'm writing website code, which is why I don't want to treat it like an
asdf package, putting it in /usr/share/common-lisp/source/.  I don't
want to point webserver document-roots at root-owned paths.
Using common-lisp-controller is more acceptable because the cache is
owned by the owner of the lisp image, and its location is hidden from
the webserver behind an interface.

Sort of ... there are some subtle differences. Your best bet is probably
the Gentoo forums, or shoot off an email to the Gentoo Lisp herd.

I have Gentoo and all four Lisps, but basically the only thing I do with
them is run Maxima and Common Music. :)

"Herd" - I like that.  Sounds more majestic and imposing than "gaggle"
(a group of penguins).  Imagine a herd of gentoos stampeding through a
corporate setting, destroying every windows cd in their path.  Mmmm...

If I find this herd, I will shoot them an email.  Thanks.

If you are having write errors then you may have a drive failing.

Look at the end of /var/log/messages on that machine and see what kind of 
errors you are getting.

Expect to replace the drive real soon now.

I would like to attend this.  I'm in Seattle.  Any chance someone from here
is going that I could hitch a ride with?  I can provide some gas money.  If
it's more than ~60 for gas I suppose I should just take the train...

Subject: [PLUG] iptables firewalling...
Message-ID: <1157242882.44fa200231796@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Is there any standard service that an Internet client should be able to
access between tcp/udp ports 1024 and 65535 on my server?  I'm thinking 
no, so I have this rule in my firewall:

iptables -A PREROUTING -t mangle -p tcp -i $global_interface \
         -d $out_address --dport 1024:65535 --syn -j DROP

I am not running a proxy server, web server, or ftp server on
this Internet connected machine.  This machine does run X, so I
don't want that to become a security problem.  NFS and RPC in
general bind to non root ports, but those aren't supposed to
be available from my server to anyone on the Net.  My rule
doesn't cover udp, but udp apparently doesn't have a 
connection flag so I don't know what to do there.

Another curiosity, why might someone or a bot for that matter 
want to connect to a very low numbered tcp/udp port such as 2 
or even port 0?

I'm assuming these probes that are getting blocked are attempts to connect
to services that don't exist.  Do I ever need to allow an Internet host
to connect from an unpriviledged udp port to my server?  Should I only log
attempts to connect to/from a priviledged >1024 udp port?

I would start with the a list of TV repair shops and call them to determine
if they could do the repair.  I knew of one place that specialized monitor
repair but I cannot seem to find them anymore.

I've never seen a monitor that was NOT compatible with linux.  You just
want to look up the specs for the monitor and see if it'll do whatever
resolution X refresh rate you want.  Then you need to get the horizontal
and vertical refresh rates for the monitor, and put those figures into
your xorg.conf file.  Has anybody ever had this NOT work for a
particular monitor?

I've certainly seen monitors that can display 1600x1200, but only at
60hz, which is unacceptably flickery.  The specs for the monitor will
plainly indicate this.

I'm no expert on these things, but isn't the interface between the video
card and monitor completely divorced from the interface between the
kernel and video card?  In other words, shouldn't this be a question of
compatibility between a monitor and a video card, with no mention at all
of the OS?

I just remembered that there is a battery place just down 82nd.  I will
check if they have batteries for the current unit.

That depends on what you consider a standard internet client.
Take a look at your /etc/services

NFS runs across udp so if you don't block it and you have shares
someone could possible soft mount your share and sponge your files.

To check your security.  To determine if there is a machine there.

It could also be an issue with the gamma settings.

What kind of video card?  If you are using the nVIDIA commercial drivers,
have you mucked with the settings?

Does the monitor have a brightness and contract setting that needs to be
adjusted?  Sometimes they get reset if there is a preset and children play
with the buttons.

Lots.  XDMCP, vnc, cvspserver, etc.  Look in /etc/services for an
incomplete list.

Of course, you would drop packets for all ports first, and then accept
specific ports afterward.  Therefore, you would only be concerned with
those ports on which you had services running.

Then there's the distinction between LAN firewall (FORWARD chain) and
WAN firewall.  You would allow tcp port 3128 (squid) on your LAN, but
not to the WAN.  Same with database socket ports.

Another thought on ports and security.  here's something I need to do,
right this minute.  I have port 22 open, but I accept password
authentication for SSH.  I need to take away password auth immediately,
and require authorized keys instead.  You should see the syslog entries
- thousands of attempts to guess usernames and passwords.  Of all the
logs I see, this one worries me the most.

For the most part, yes.  There are some special instances where the
video card driver and X(.org) need to know about how the monitor is
plugged in -- usually in a dual-headed environment, or on a card with
both a DVI and a VGA output (and you're using both).  But otherwise,
yes.  

We wouldn't get very far into the boot process if monitors didn't work
without the OS telling them what to do. ;)

Using keys will add extra security, but it won't stop the log files
from filling up.  Lately it seems a whole dictionary is being used for
these attacks (it used to be just a dozen words at a time: root,
admin, apache, john, etc.).  I guess using a whole dictionary has been
more successful for these guys.

At least it seemed to work for one client's server.  He created a user
account using a common name and used the same name as the password.
There were about 3GB of outgoing e-mail choked up in the spool, by the
time I got there (SMTP port was blocked).  Apparently when these
attempts are successful, the attacking script just pushes another
generic mailer script out and kicks it off blind.  (Was a simple Perl
script.)

But back to the log files...  The only way to stop these attacks from
filling up your log files is to block port 22.  You can do this and
open up the port for just a few specific IP addresses.  Or you can
close it for all IP addresses and dynamically open it up for specific
ones using port knocking.

Some would say port knocking isn't a worthy security measure.  Perhaps
so.  However, having clean log files is still a wonderful thing. ;-)

Here's a shameless plug for a port-knocking technique you can use
anywhere iptables is available: http://www.soloport.com/iptables.html

That will increase your security, but your poor ole logfiles are still going 
to get hammered. A good tool for protecting both your system and your 
logfiles is Denyhosts. http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/

It's easy to use. Denyhosts blocks bogus ssh login attempts, and protects 
other services too, by parsing your logs and then writing rules 
to /etc/hosts.deny, all according to whatever criteria you set.

DenyHosts is in the gentoo portage tree.  I am sold.

I do like the soloport solution too, but I get a cheap thrill from
identifying and denying specific jerks.  Getting an email that says
something like, "I just denied this jerk for you" will certainly bring a
smile to my face.  I used to spend a half hour every weekend denying
jerks manually.

Both these solutions address ssh only.  At first, one might wish for a
more comprehensive tool.  But I have not seen many other attacks that are
anywhere near as worrisome.  Putting apache behind pound was a good move
because pound rejects fishy requests.  But those attacks were all aimed
at IIS anyway, what with "...xxxxxxxxxxxxcmd.exe" style attempts at
getting a shell, or "../../../../WINDOWS/etcetc" attempts to walk into
the WINDOWS directory.  IIS is so lame that it does not support the
concept of a document-root jail.

You'd think script kiddies would add a bit to their scripts that would
determine the OS of the victim before launching IIS attacks, port 1433
scans, etc.  I'd have more respect for them if they displayed more
intelligence (but only a little tiny bit more).  I guess the hackers we
should worry about are the ones who do not leave a paper trail a mile
long in syslog, like cross-site script attackers.  If I were a hacker, I
would not go after the most secure application known to man.  I would go
after hole-ridden webapps.  Maybe it's time to pay closer attention to
database logs, and start logging all queries, and validating the
bejeezus out of dynamic SQL, and escaping all form input before
redisplaying it in a web page or stashing it in a database table.

   I agree that portknocking alone is weak but all good security has
layers. When portknocking is used in combination with rsa authentication
and strong username and passwords it certainly helps. If portknocking
allows you to be invisible to 90% of the script kiddies out there then
all the better. Plus your logs will thank you...
   Below is a little variation of the same portknocking idea. Its a bit
more simplistic but I like it that way. If I don't have to build scripts
to knock from remote hosts then I am happy. Just telnet to the central
port and boom you're in. If a fella wanted to build scripts to connect
and make it difficult then he might as well do encrypted icmp
portknocking or something fancy like that. I am all about simplicity
myself and yes I have to connect from other systems like windows boxes.
   Funny thing is I originally got it from the same website. Can't find
the old link though... 
   Keep in mind that you will want to have the --remove statements above
and below the port number you use for access. This way if there are any
crawling access attempts they will end up closing the port no matter
which direction they scan.
   To use just telnet to the unlock port(6423) and break the telnet
connection. This will open 22 for your ip address. Then when you are
done just telnet to the lock port(either 6422 or 6424).

#SSH PORTKNOCKING:

Well, the current method is really a state machine, so the
distribution of ports is irrelevant.  For example, if one knocks on
6424, then 6422 to get in, any other sequence brings it back to state
zero.  So, scanning 6424 then 6423 already reverts it to state zero.
It has to be exact or it collapses.

Pretty sure I wrote the original article (the one you can't find) and
later discarded it for the new, better (me thinks) technique.

You can still use telnet with the new rules. I just got tired of
typing so much and wrote the script you see in the article.  (Guess I
could do 'telnet <host> <port1>; sleep 2; kill $PID' etc. instead of
using 'nmap <timeout flags> ...'. Some day... as nmap isn't always
available.)

Subject: [PLUG] Samba/Windows 98/XP browse protocol
Message-ID: <44FD77AF.1070204@alcpress.com>

A customer had an entirely Windows 98 network until today.
When they added a Windows XP box, the Windows 98 machines
would no longer display anything in Network Neighborhood.
I assume that the browse protocol is different and/or the
XP box now wins browser elections. Can Samba service such
a mixed network?

A related matter: When I installed a new server with the latest
Samba, the Windows 98 computers did not see Samba file shares -
this was before the XP box was connected.

There is an answer about this in the Samba FAQ. There is a registry hack
needed to make it work.  You pretty much disable effective password security
on the shares when you do this BTW.  (Win98 has some serious problems in
authentication for Samba shares that make it trivially crackable.)

If you cannot find it, drop me a line off list and I will go look it up.

I don't recall seeing this behavior in the last mixed network I was in,
which utilized a linux box as the master browser.  We used settings like
these in smb.conf:

     os level = 99
     preferred master = Yes
     domain master = Yes
     local master = Yes
     enhanced browsing = Yes
     wins support = Yes

Although looking at the official samba docs, it seems that they use:

     os level = 65

instead of 99.

I'm not seeing any definition of "enhanced browsing" at the moment, but
I seem to recall it has something to do with older windows vs. newer
windows.  In the network where these settings were used, both 98 and XP
boxes could browse.

I used to spend many hours watching BROWSER packets in ethereal in our
network of 100+ computers.  Every time something went wrong with
browsing, it would be found in this manner, and it invariably was a
rogue machine with el-crappo WINS settings.  We dished out WINS settings
via DHCP, but if a windows box has hardcoded values, it will use those
instead.  One such windows box will take down the whole ship.  You ought
to look for machines that have bogus WINS server settings, or are set to
broadcast unnecessarily.  Look for machines trying to take over as
master browser.  There will be a tug-of-war between the real master
browser and the rogue box.

I have since moved on to a new company, which is a windows shop all the
way (how I got them to let me build my workstation with linux is still a
mystery).  Therefore, I have no access to a mixed samba network any more
(my home network is 100% linux, and no samba).  So I'm riding on pure
memory here.  Hope I didn't steer you wrong.

The ircony of course is that the whole point of logging is to catch
things like this. You *want* to know that host x.y.z.w is an evil guy.
The issue is that you don't want nearly so many log entries. This strikes
me as a case for connection limiting at the firewall (say 5 connections
every 3 minutes per host), and changing sshd so that it quickly starts
rejecting connections from a host that repeatedly fails.

Agreed.  Hack attempts should be logged.  No onw should be able to
attempt a breakin and get by unnoticed.  Who cares how big the logs
get; that's what logrotate is for.  It would be nice to be able to move
certain entries to a different log file, though.  The One Big Syslog
model is a little dated.  DenyHosts writes logs to its own file, and it
writes plenty of them, and it looks like a very easily parsable format.

I'm still waiting for a "return customer" to see how DenyHosts logs a
hack attempt from an IP that is already in hosts.deny.

Connection limiting in iptables is annoying and just asking for trouble. You 
end up writing whitelist rules to let legitimate users in without delays, and 
it turns into a mess. DenyHosts handles it elegantly and simply.

Knockd is a nice port-knocking implementation that is also easy to use,

Both work for any service.

                               Bryce Harrington
                               <bryce at osdl.org>
 
      Inkscape is an Open Source vector graphics editor, with capabilities 
      similar to Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDraw, or Xara X using the  
      W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics  (SVG) file format. 
      Supported SVG features include shapes, paths, text, markers, 
      clones, alpha blending, transforms, gradients, patterns, and  
      grouping. Inkscape also supports Creative Commons meta-data, 
      node editing, layers, complex path operations, bitmap tracing, 
      text-on-path, flowed text, direct XML editing, and more. It imports 
      formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and others and exports PNG as 
      well as multiple vector-based formats.

      Inkscape's main goal is to create a powerful and convenient drawing 
      tool fully compliant with XML, SVG, and CSS standards. We also aim 
      to maintain a thriving user and developer community by using open, 
      community-oriented development process, and by making sure Inkcape 
      is easy to learn, to use, and to extend.

Folks,

I've been working for a while now to put a super-gig together for ya'll.
I'm proud to announce that CRIME is co-hosting a conference entitled 

"Technology, Intelligence, and the Preservation of Civil Liberties"

Other co-hosts are The Pacific Institute for Ethics and Social Policy
(Pacific University); and the Hillsboro Police Department. 

Featured Speakers: Dave Aucsmith and Howard Schmidt.  

Dates of Conference:  17 - 19 November 2006 at the Columbia Maritime
Museum (an awesome venue in itself).

Details and are set forth in the URL below.  Obviously, there are fees
involved in a gig of this caliber.  The conference is $150.  We've
reserved the entire Cannery Pier Hotel, a beautiful new place next to
the bridge and on the water.  The hotel includes continental breakfasts,
and wine & cheese in the evenings.  

The conference has additionally issued a call for papers.  Authors of
selected papers will also present them at this gig.  Check it out at--

Check the logs.  If there was an I/O error that caused the kernel to
remount the partition, then it should be recorded.  Since it is the
/var/log partition, you might not have anything.  It could have been a
kernel panic or transient I/O error instead of a hard drive error.

Try running SMART diagnostics.  Modern drives will record the errors
and lots of other diagnostics.  The smartctl program (in the
smartmontools package on RH) can query them.  When hard drives report
read and write errors to the OS, they are usually ready to fail
because they have already gone through all their bad sectors.

Subject: [PLUG] Sed and POSIX character class question
Message-ID: <1157641100.4567.10.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I've been playing around with sed recently and am surprised by why and
how this line doesn't accomplish the task I intended, which would be
capitalizing the first lower case letter in each line:

sed 's/[[:lower:]]/[[:upper:]]/' testing.txt

The file "testing.txt" contains this line:
THIS IS a lower case letter.

The result of the command is:
THIS IS [[:upper:]] lower case letter.

So it seems to use the POSIX character class to find the first lower
case letter, but then instead of replacing it with a matching upper case
letter, it inserts the string "[[:upper:]]"

Two questions:
Any idea why sed works like this?
Other solutions?

Thanks,

David

That's a great way to replace the first lower-case character with
'[[:upper:]]'.  You might find 'y/[[:lower:]]/[[:upper:]]/' more useful
for transliterating lower to upper.

Long time no see,

Thanks Aaron, but, I started with the y option. Does it work for you?
Here's what I get:

$ sed 'y/[[:lower:]]/[[:upper:]]/' testing.txt
THIS IS a upper case uetter.

Notice that it's substituting a "u" for and "l" here...

Subject: [PLUG] Failing Hardware
Message-ID: <450045AF.2060701@comcast.net>

My current machine has re-booted itself twice in the last 24-48 hours. I 
was sitting at my desk the first time it happened, and watched it 
respond the way it would if I had hit the hardware reset button on the 
front of the box. The second time was overnight last night.

Any recommendations on what to test to see if this is a relatively 
simple fix?

The machine is an older Micron: Pentium II, 192MB RAM.

After the first time, SuSE 9.1 booted correctly and all programs that I 
normally use started correctly. After the second time, my network card 
configuration was hosed (this has happened before), and when I started 
Thunderbird and Firefox, neither opened with my usual profile, but 
instead wanted me to select one. Realizing that there was a network 
issue, I started YaST, made it look like I had edited the Ethernet card 
configuration, and clicked on "finish". In the past, that's all I needed 
to do, but this time that wasn't enough -- I still could not see outside 
this machine. However, a re-boot cleared whatever was confused, and I'm 
back to normal, as far as I can tell. At least Thunderbird and Firefox 
started with my profile.

You might want to run memtest86, just to rule out bad memory.  One place
you can get memtest86 is on a gentoo livecd.

Maybe try to leave your machine booted up under knoppix or some other cd
distro, and see if the problem still occurs.  This would eliminate your
suse load and the hard drive from the equation.

Most likely cause: the CPU or power-supply fan's stopped spinning.

Cheap used replacements available at FreeGeek for the price of a nice
cup of coffee.  Entire replacement computers with higher specs available
there for the price of a nice meal.

50% off if you put in a few hours as a volunteer.

Less likely cause: corrosion in the RAM or CPU contacts.  Remove, dust
and reinstall RAM and CPU(s).

Good luck,
  Aaron

Subject: [PLUG] New Hardware Recommendations
Message-ID: <450047E0.90505@comcast.net>

 From my other post, you should understand the reason for this one!

I'm starting to seriously think about building a new computer. I'm sure 
everyone has their own "best" idea of what to get, and where. What I'd 
like are recommendations on how to think about that.

I'd like a machine that has sufficient horsepower and memory to handle 
the usual everyday stuff like T-bird and Firefox, The GIMP, and a few 
games. I'd also like to retire my old Win98 machine and run the few 
programs I need to under VMware. Plus, I'll want to be able to try out 
some Linux CAD tools, and one or two games.

I'm guessing that almost any ordinary box will probably handle that, but 
I'd like to hear what the collective wisdom has to say.

This time, I'd like to take the time to go get the various parts and 
build the box from scratch - get a quiet case, a motherboard, etc. At 
least, I'd like to look at the difference in cost doing it that way vs. 
buying a box at a local outlet, such as Pacific Solutions. I'm willing 
to order from reliable web stores, since I'm not in a big hurry.

Thanks for any recommendations.

Thanks. Actually, I have it. I just have to compile it and install it on 
a floppy -- this machine still has one of those!

Good idea. I'll be gone for most of the day, so I'll try to do that 
before I leave and see if it's still running when I get home.

After perusing the docs, it looks like SED doesn't support nice regexes
for y//.  The examples use e.g. y/abcdef/ABCDEF/ instead.  The tr shell
command does, though.  

   aaron at abu:~$ tr [[:lower:]] [[:upper:]] < testing.txt
   THIS IS A LOWER CASE LETTER.

Have fun,

At the moment, I couldn't say whether the CPU fan is running or not, but 
the power supply one is (it's a relatively new supply, too).

I've purchased a few things there in the past. It's been long enough 
that they might have better machines than mine by now!

I'd forgotten about that. I've been playing with these things since 
before IBM came out with the PC, and have had to deal with minor 
corrosion issues before. At that time, a Pink Pearl eraser was the 
recommended tool for cleaning card edges. The box sits on a piece of 
wood on the carpet under my desk, so dust is highly likely to have 
accumulated. Perhaps a little maintenance is in order.

Thanks for the ideas.

Three reccs: Antec Quiet case (does what it sez on the can), AMD64 chip
(most folks say they emit less heat for the same performance) and
Seagate Barracuda drive.  More on http://www.silentpcreview.com

Some of the Small Form-Factor shoebox-sized systrems are pretty quiet
and fast, if you don't need to add any PCI cards.

Or just get a Dell.  They're quiet and have good warranties.

Hardware is fun! Here are the bits I've been using the last couple years and 
liking a lot:

-Antec Sonata case. love them. They're big, but you can't beat their cooling, 
quietness, and ease of access
-Thermaltake power supplies are very good and nicely-priced. Of course PC 
Power & Cooling are the top-of-the-line, if you can afford them.
-SATA hard drive or drives
-Crucial and Kingston RAM are affordable and good-quality
-Don't go cheap on the motherboard because this will hurt you over the long 
run. Check the reviews on Newegg.com and Anandtech. Tom's Hardware used to be 
helpful, but who has the time or patience to click through twenty ad-laden 
pages just to read a single article?
-AMD processors. Semprons are great buys, though I suppose if you can find a 
deal on an Athlon that would be a good choice. AMD 64 has native 32-bit 
support, so you can use either 32- or 64-bit Linux. It looks like socket AM2 
is the new kewl socket, and 754 is being phased out

Gotchas to look out for:

-RAM comes in all kinds of speeds now. You must get the correct speed
-PCI comes in multiple flavors:
	
	3.3 volt
	5 volt
	PCI-Express

If you have the budget, go for PCI-E. This uses dedicated buses instead of a 
shared bus for all devices, so it's very fast, and it's backwards-compatible, 
so you can still use your old PCI adapters.
 
Voltage incompatibility can bite you. 5 volt is the old stuff, 3.3 is new. 
Some mobos support both. 

Start your research at Newegg.com. Their prices are great, lots of customer 
reviews, and their shipping is almost instant. It's a good place to do your 
homework before talking to a local vendor.

Is this history coursework or just curiosity?

I found this nugget in the manual:
  # check if converted file name is equal to original file name,
  # if it is, do not print nothing
  /^.*\/\(.*\)\n\1/b

Which is about half a line below:

  LOWER='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
  UPPER='ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'

I spent a few hours in the sed manual once and all I took away was:

  echo "foo
  bar
  baz" | sed -n '2{p;q}'

That was enough.  It might be interesting to see sed rebuilt with perl 
regular expressions, but Sed.pm isn't quite what I had in mind.  Just 
something that makes the other features of sed accessible for things 
like:

  echo "foo
  bar
  baz" | perl -e 'print +(<>)[1]'

(which is likely slower than the sed #{p;q} invocation)

And of course sed still suprises me on occasion.  Maybe the examples are 
just really bad.  After reading the perlre manpage, I decided to poke 
at sed from a different angle.

Did you want to capitalize the first letter?
  echo "foo" | sed 's/^\(.\)/\u\1/'

Or the first lowercase letter?
  sed 's/\([[:lower:]]\)/\u\1/'

Or
  sed 's/\(.*\)/\U\1\E/'

PCI Express slots are not backwards compatible with any prior generation
stuff.  Perhaps you were thinking of PCI-X.

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI-X

With the advent of PCI-Express, PCI-X is pretty much dead.  I doubt you
will find many motherboards that support PCI-X, particularly at the
consumer level.

PCI-Express motherboards typically have bridge chips that support
standard PCI slots. This is how they get backwards compatibility.

If you want to build a box, then Carla's recommendation to start at 
newegg.com is a great one.

If you're content to buy a machine that'll do your "everyday stuff," 
then a Dell Dimension 1100n for $300 isn't a bad start. It's got a 
Celeron D -- which doesn't sound like much, but here at work we've got 
a couple running Xen with multiple VMs and they work great. Dell cases 
are roomy and fairly quiet; it's easy to add/upgrade hardware.

I usually get the 1100n rather than the standard 1100. It comes with 
FreeDOS rather than XP Home, and I get a warm feeling whenever Dell 
mails me a hard copy of the GPL. :-)

Ok, that works so kudos :-) and to answer Eric Wilhelm, it's mostly just
curiosity. I'm working through trying to put together a review of
O'Reilly's new LPI Certificiation book:

http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lpicertnut2/

and got intrigued by the half support of POSIX in my example. I couldn't
tell if it was sed or myself that wasn't processing correctly :-)

So far the book is a great single source of prep for the LPI. Although
at 961 pages, calling it part of the "In a nutshell" series seems to
stretch the definition of nutshell...

FWIW, I'm looking at new laptops, and am having a devil of a time
figuring out what laptops have VT enabled (Virtualization Technology -
which enables installation of unaltered OSes) - primarily used for Xen
(and I gather Parallels). Seems like HP disables VT on all of its
laptops with Core Duo / Core 2 Duo CPUs (even though Intel advertises
this feature on all but the lowest end of these CPUs). 

Dell business sales seems OK, they indicated that all of their systems
with T2400 CPUs and above have VT enabled (or enableable). So I go to a
local Dell Outlet store to check it out, and lo and behold, the salesman
there refuses to allow me to look at the BIOS menu, says he's not even
allowed to do it himself. What BS!

Found a VT enable on one of the Toshibas (U205-S5022) at CompUSA. Looked
sweet, a fairly affordable laptop about 4 lbs. Next step is a Fry's
outing to check some of their BIOS.

Thanks,
Mike

They may have changed, but I have had two horrible experiences
personally with Dell, and three more from acquaintances and business
partners.  Some subset of what they sell may come from a division
of this very large company on that makes reliable goods and supports
it well.  But as recently as a year ago, I worked with a company that
had a Dell boneyard of desktop boxes and LCD displays - about 3 dead
units per month for a 15 person company.  There was a significant
impact on productivity as these damned things went flaky.

I could go on about the laptop that took 3 months to repair, with the
baldface lie count reaching a dozen, or the GIANT boneyard in the
back room of a small bay area support company, but you get the picture.
Dell is a big company, and they probably have good divisions along with
the bad ones I encountered;  if you have had good luck with one of the
divisions, you should identify the particular product so people can
focus on that..

I'd like to add a dell story or two:

A guy I work with had a dell workstation.  One day the fan started
racing out of control.  Turned out there were a dozen or so large
capacitors on the motherboard that had melted down.

Another guy at a previous place of work had a dell latitude laptop which
tanked.  It took a year for dell to send a working replacement.  In the
process, they sent him another latitude that also tanked.  Many lies
involved there too.

I had a dell inspiron 8200 laptop.  I got 2 and a half years out of it
before the motherboard tanked.  That's $600 a year for the use of a
laptop - too much money in my opinion.

Building your own machine is the way to go.  If the thing is going to
die, it shouldn't cost you a house payment.  If you need a portable
unit, consider building a mini-itx box in a briefcase.  In fact, stick 2
boards in there and cluster them together.  That's my plan.

I, too, have had recent disappointing hardware experiences with Dell 
systems, the Dimension line in particular.  My company purchased about 8 
systems in the course of a year, 3 of which have had hard drive problems 
within the first 4 months.  Still, contacting Dell for replacement 
hardware was not difficult and relatively speedy.  If you go with Dell, 
I would recommend shelling out a few more for the Optiplex system line 
which has a better hardware track record from my experience.

Careful, the bad divisions might get word of that and try to make 
themselves look better by sabotaging the competition (like you said, 
it's a big company -- the probably don't even know they're on the same 
team.)

My Dill laptop was not too impressive.  Despite never having traveled 
much, there's a crack in the lid and a corner missing next to the 
hinge.  There was also a ghost in the keyboard at one point, but that 
might not have been Dill's fault.  Of course, my Sharp^WDull now has a 
C key which pops off if hit it just wrong and that's only after a year 
and a half (but maybe that's from hitting ctrl+c too often while trying 
to deal with the emperor linux kernel.)

As for workstations, "never buy a workstation from anyone" is probably a 
good rule of thumb.  There are probably a few good vendors out there 
(somewhere), but the mainstream vendors seem to think you'll be happy 
as long as it has a "pentium 9" sticker on the front even with doggy 
on-board video, half a power supply, a pittance of the slowest ram they 
could find, and a hard drive that runs about as fast as a couple of 
distracted scribe-wielding hamsters.

I have been using Dell successfully in my Printshop for 10 years and can say
That they are what you make them.  If you buy the warranty (why wouldn't
you?) you
Will never have a problem.  If something goes wrong, I make 1 (one) phone
call and
The next day a technician is at my store fixing the system.

There is really nothing more to it than that.  They fix it.

Question: Is Windows networking token based like token ring networks
are?  How does ReactOS do with samba?  I know ReactOS isn't out of
alpha yet, but it might offer a nice alternative to broken MS-Windows
systems eventually.  Concerning browser elections, why does Microsoft
networking require master browser, etc?  With all the Netscape IE
cases in the late 90's, why didn't the justice department force 
Microsoft to redesign Windows so that competitors can replace the
networking code outright including the TCP/IP stack?  
Apparently, IE upgrades had a tendency to break a DLL that Netscape
depended on.  I've never seen an outright ban of this particular
anti-competitive tactic.  If Microsoft wasn't an application 
software and operating system company, it'd be more limited in
it's ability to control middle ware.

ReactOS is at http://www.reactos.org/.

BTW:  Freedos 1.0 finally got released.  http://www.freedos.org/

These two efforts aren't a drop in replacement yet for Windows,
but perhaps that day is coming.

Michael Robinson

....because you can buy from IBM / Lenovo for roughly the same price
(once you drop $300-$500 on  a Dell warranty... and you can get fine
used hardware from lonovo that is warrantied for even cheaper.) get
better components, design, support (both community and official), and
peace of mind -- There are far fewer horror stories about IBM than
there are about DELL / Gateway / HP / Compaq... etc...

I *have* heard that Dell LCDs are top-notch, however, and I've been
happy with the monitors of theirs that I've used. (heh, although, no
story about Dell is devoid of at least one scare... back at my grad
lab a few years back we had about a 30% fail rate on 19" Dell LCDs.)

I'd buy a monitor or an etch-a-sketch from dell, but for computers I'm
sticking with Lonovo and Apple.

I prefer dealing with local vendors.  It is worth the extra couple of 
bucks to have someplace in town I can go to to get things fixed it it 
happens to fail.

I also like to build my own systems, so I know what is in it.

I have been very happy with Pacific Solutions on Powell.  I have been 
shopping there for years with no real problems.

I tried booting an old knoppix cd yesterday. It got as far as a female 
voice saying something (I think it was just telling me that sound was 
working). The screen was blank with a very dark blue (purple?) 
background. At that point I had to leave. It was still in that condition 
when I returned 7 hours later.

I rebooted, made a memtest86 floppy and ran that. I checked it a couple 
of times throughout the evening. Each time there was a column of what I 
think were hex numbers, one per line, and repeating (sort of)5 at a time 
  for the 25 lines on the screen. I let it run overnight. Below is my 
hand typed copy of what was on the screen (and still is) when I looked 
at it this morning.

I've left it so that if there is anything else useful to do with that 
screen it's still there. I welcome any and all help in interpreting 
these results.

Thanks!

Thanks for all the ideas. I'll start reading the reviews on various 
motherboards. If what it will take to get my old system running again 
costs very much at all, I'll probably limp along on this emachine Win98 
box until I can build the new one.

Make sure you're running LDAP... 2.6 kernel for the latest Drupal  
upgrade... and it should work just fine.
It's Linux... who cares about the work!!

I can't answer directly as I've never done it, but LDAP seems like the
solution, if all of them support it. Drupal does.

I don't know much about mediawiki, but I wonder why you'd run that as
well as Drupal. If you want more information on Drupal, there is a
meeting scheduled for next Tuesday at FreeGeek. 6:00 PM.

Full information at http://groups.drupal.org/node/1241

I'm sure someone there may be able to answer additional questions. I'm
hoping they can answer a few of mine.....

If spending 5 years there but not getting a degree counts, then yes I
am.  I was there from 1988 to 1993, majoring in music.  Now I have a
nice, sensible career in software development.

Subject: [PLUG] Local Web Hosting
Message-ID: <1157770332.6938.9.camel@localhost.localdomain>

The $job has asked I find a local web host (local is very important)
that is both "good" and will have "good customer service".  

What's needed:
- Web hosting, with FrontPage extensions, FTP, and shell (SSH/Telnet)
access.  The big-three (Perl, PHP, and SSI) are implied requirements.  
- Email hosting, accessible either by POP3 or IMAP (preferred), or both.

It's important that the host have a pretty dang good uptime (ie, not
taken down every weekend for "maintenance" or some such) and be
reasonably priced.  Ideally, they'd have a fairly patient technical
support staff as well -- I may not always be around.

Suggestions?

A quick google found only a couple, Aracnet(SpiritOne) and Canvass
Dreams.

their SysAdmin, Sean Hanson, is not paid enough regardless of how much they
pay him. Very highly recommended without any reservations whatsoever.

I've have great things to say about Sterling in the Tigard area.  We had
webspace/domain hosting and colo there, and they are great people do
deal with.  Very professional, and down-to-earth.  Their technical
people are top-notch and get on your problem right away.  I don't recall
if their hosting platforms support SSH, but you could easily ask if it
was something you could have.   www.sterling.net

I did:
perl -i.bak -pe's/^(.*?)([a-z])(.*)/$1\u$2$3/' inputfile

And was pretty verbose with the regexp, just to be on the safe side.

Every once in a while, my Evolution Email Reader just croaks.  The inbox

~/.evolution/mail/local and delete the indexes and things would be fine
for a while.  Then one day last week this did not work.  I started
looking around again and found the
~/.evolution/mail/spool/var/spool/mail/<username> directory which had
INBOX.cmeta, INBOX.ibex.index, and INBOX.ibex.index.data files and
some .%23evolution%2f/Junk.meta and .%23evolution%2fTrash.cmeta files.
Deleting these files, then restarting evolution got evolution back in

I had the same issue

/usr/bin/thunderbird also works to solve this problem.  The great thing

There of those of us who are forced to use evolution because our
workplaces are Infernal Microsoft Shops which use Exchange, and the
microsoft point-and-click network admins won't turn on IMAP for us
pine users (well, just me).  If there is another email client that
can talk Exchange, I would love to hear about it.  Any ideas?

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to migrate from Evolution

Last time I had to deal with it, evolution kept its mail in standard
mbox format, in ~/.evolution/mail/local/ with folder names being
folder.sbd.  With a bit of copying, you could easily point thunderbird
at your mail.

This is an answer if you do POP, but not if you are an IMAP or Exchange
client.  Here's all the folders I have that are siblings to the local/
folder:

drwxr-xr-x 2 ckonstanski ckonstanski 9744 Sep  9 11:57 config
drwx------ 3 ckonstanski ckonstanski  104 Dec 18  2005 exchange
drwx------ 5 ckonstanski ckonstanski  208 Jan 28  2006 imap
drwxr-xr-x 3 ckonstanski ckonstanski 1296 Sep  9 11:57 local
drwx------ 3 ckonstanski ckonstanski   96 Dec 18  2005 pop
-rw------- 1 ckonstanski ckonstanski   68 Sep  9 11:57 searches.xml
drwxr-xr-x 2 ckonstanski ckonstanski   80 Sep  7 15:10 vfolder
drwxr-xr-x 2 ckonstanski ckonstanski 3376 Sep  8 12:32 views

One cannot rely on IMAP and Exchange emails all getting cached locally.

I've not heard of a monitor that won't work with Linux. Yes, there are 
edge cases, but this doesn't sound like one of them.

I've heard of monitors that won't do the resolution you are asking for, 
but that's not the fault of Linux. That's the hardware.

What I've found is that monitors are less expensive to acquire than to fix.

Even this 20.1" widescreen LCD I'm looking at right now was less than 
$400, does 1680 X 1050, and has a fantastic picture. It works in every 
OS I've thrown at it, and I test a lot of them.

A 19" CRT monitor that supports 1600x1280 resolution should be less than 
$200 brand new. That's why it's hard to find repair shops. They can't 
stay in business fixing 2 or 3 monitors a year, when buying a new 
monitor is easier and faster.

I'll second Ken's opinion.
Especially after I've got Sager AMD dual core 17" with SATA drive 
notebook from Uptech way way below its average market prize.

I can't speak to their dedicated and managed offerings but EasyStreet's 
shared web hosting used to be outsourced to some company who provides an 
EasyStreet branded control panel interface; I've been forced to use it 
on several occasions.  If that's still the case I would *never* 
recommend them, it was always a terrible experience as compared to a 
decent hosting company.

Dear Alex, 

Does your Sager dual core support VT (Virtualization Technology)? Is it
one of the rebranded Clevos?

Thanks,

I am writing a webapp using lisp/araneida.  In a webapp, you never want to 
enter the debugger under any circumstances.  However, you do want copious 
information in your logs.

I can get the text of the error into the logs easily enough with
something like:

(format nil "Error while rendering page: ~A" error)

My question is, how do I print the entire backtrace as well?

What I'm after is something akin to the java
Exception.printStackTrace().

I searched high and low on google for an answer first.  This is a sure
way to make it so you'll find it in 2 seconds flat.

Can you provide the output from the '/sbin/lspci' program?  It has a lot 
more useful information including the exact card type.

A couple of websites you can go to look for compatibility and drivers 
include:
http://madwifi.org/
http://linux-wless.passys.nl/

Message-ID: <c834ec80609110904h7e5c7771l8685a78bba4167c0@mail.gmail.com>

I'm looking for a pcmcia CF / SD card reader to stick in my
ubuntu-running T42 -- There is a mess of cards out there and a bunch
of (rather old -- circa 2004) data about which cards work under linux.
 However, nothing current and informative has turned up in the Google
pipe yet.

Being the picky bastard I am (re: hardware, at least) I thought I'd
ask around for personal experiences with these devices.  Does anyone
have suggestions / warnings? Can these be left in 24/7, or do they
typically need to be removed - inserted after reboots or sleep / wake
cycles?  Are they flush with the edge of the computer, or do they
protrude? How do you generally get the cards in / out? (Given that
some fit 4-6 kinds of memory, it seems inevitable that some cards will
protrude while others need to be ejected..)

Any input would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Rogan

Subject: [PLUG] How to confirm OSS support before hardward purchase?
Message-ID: <20060911160938.O19792@eehouse.org>

I'm shopping for a new machine to run Debian or Ubuntu fulltime.  So
I'm looking for a way to confirm, ideally prior to purchase, that a
machine is fully compatible with free software.

I used to think just booting it off an Ubuntu Live CD would be enough:
if video and sound work it's cool.  But my work-issue Dell laptop runs
Ubuntu, and I recently discovered Ubuntu installed proprietary
binary-only video drivers for its nvidia graphics subsystem.
Binary-only is ok for work, but not for a home machine.  So I need
another strategy.

(Maybe.  A related question is whether it's possible to run nvidia or
ATI chips, perhaps without using all their features, using open-source
drivers.  I need to run Gimp and emacs on this machine, not Doom.)

There's also the issue, mentioned here recently, of testing whether an
Intel-based box has "Virtualization Technology" disabled.  That's
never written up in company specs, and sales droids don't know what it
is.

How do folks on this list verify that a machine is fully open-source
friendly?  Short if taking advantage of Fry's 14-day return policy, I
mean. :-)

Thanks,

The ATI open source drivers work fairly well, the nVIDIA open source 
drivers less so.  The part you want is not just the OpenGL, but the 
hardware acceleration.  You will want to avoid the real high end ATI 
chipsets though, because some are not supported.

The Intel video chipsets are also well supported with xorg 7.1.

The other closed source place you might get bit is if you need a modem. 
Most of the "WinModems" are pretty hard to get working under Linux due to 
proprietary bits.

Wireless cards are sometimes a pain.  Depends on the chipset.  The MadWifi 
drivers cover a number that are not supported out of the box.

One way to figure out what you are in for is to boot off a knopix disc and 
look at /sbin/lspci .

I am not certain how you would check that other than booting off a very 
recient kernel and checking dmesg output.

"Fry's" is a descriptive verb.

In /proc/cpuinfo, the 'flags' section should report 'vmx' if ia32 VT 
is enabled.

I haven't, however, checked to see if enabling or disabling VT in BIOS 
toggles the presence of the vmx flag.

My experience is that Dell ships with VT disabled, at least on Pentium 
D chips. I don't know about other hardware/BIOS makers.

There is support for the broadcom chipsets, you just need to have the
firmware.

In Fedora Core 5 extras there is a program for removing the firmware bits
from the Windows drivers.   It is called " bcm43xx-fwcutter".  I have used
it and it has worked pretty well.

To follow up on that -- the "ati" driver (the free one) supports just
about every ATI card there is, though, any ATI card with a R300 core (I
think the Radeon 9500 and higher) does not support Direct Rendering.
Work is being done, as I understand, to bring that support, but it's
slow and buggy, at best. the binary "fglrx" driver from ATI supports
every card they have.  Also, both ATI drivers fail to support the
COMPOSITE extension.

MadWifi drivers support Atheros chipset radios, except USB, which it
doesn't support.  

Personal Telco uses madwifi a lot on the Mississippi Grant Project,
and have a love/hate relationship with it.  By and large, it works
pretty well but has its faults.  The developers suck on the
manufacturer's toes a little too much for my tastes, they are totally
dependent on Atheros to release a binary HAL to let it work,
madwifi-ng has had a tendency to kernel panic if you ifdown/ifup too
much, etc.

I use the older madwifi on my laptop (with an atheros a/b/g card) and
it is pretty stable.

Sorry, I don't know the Intel code names. It's the virtualization 
stuff (like AMD's Pacifica), that allows hypervisors to run unmodified 
x86 operating systems in lightweight virtual machines.

In my experience, you won't find a PCMCIA card w/ both CF and SD,
given the size of CF.

I got an CF to PCMCIA for my wife and she leaves it in all the time.
Since it's flush w/ the computer, you have to pop it out to get the CF
card back out. They are extremely simple (just an "unpowered plug
adapter" according to wikipedia).

Dunno about SD -> PCMCIA. If you could find a Type 2, you could stack
them in your PCMCIA slots.

First off, who is to say that monitors can't be fixed profitably?  I suppose
it's okay for people to simply throw electronic equipment in the dump if it
costs money to do the right thing.  It's easy to produce disposable electronics,
but it is not environmentally friendly.  I for one, like others I'm sure, 
want to be able to use what I know works.  Name one LCD panel or CRT
manufacturer anywhere that will let the buyer know their display is Linux
compatible up front.  It is safe to assume, for the most part, that a standard
monitor will work with Linux.  That which is valid today may not be valid 
in the future.

With a company like HP trying to "plug intellectual property leaks," 
it seems quite clear that companies want to have and charge the public 
for use of proprietary closed technology.  Does anyone think these companies
care which part of the hardware or software in a person's computer is
proprietary?  An attitude that the public shouldn't have access to 
technologies they understand completely which will serve their needs 
fully seems very much alive.  Since when is it a good move for HP's top exec 
to attempt to keep her position after being caught entrapping her own 
employees via illegal wire taps?  I used to think that HP was an OSS 
friendly company.  Anymore, I question the company's real motivation 
with this recent scandal.  HP generally isn't a monitor manufacturer, 
but it's the sorta attitude this scandal has revealed which suggests 
to me that their is room for future compatibility problems.

My monitor, though dark, is what I have right now.  I'm low on funds, it's a
shame if I have no money to dispose of it that it will be difficult to do the
environmentally right thing.  Monitors aren't the only problem, how many 
circuit boards contain lead solder?  Disposable digital cameras have circuitry
in them, what is the impact on the environment from these being tossed into
our landfills?  Will we poison vital groundwater sources by throwing consumer
electronics into our landfills?  If people have to spend their own money to do
the right thing with worn out electronic devices that aren't worth fixing, I
seriously that the majority will.

Turns out that in SBCL, it's as easy as:

(sb-debug:backtrace-as-list)

The file util.lisp in the TBNL source has a series of (get-backtrace)
functions (one for each flavor of lisp) that helped a lot.  Thanks.

Right, most closely associated with Xen. Without VT, Xen only works with
"paravirtualized" (i.e. Xen modified) OSes. The Xen developers have
reportedly modified Win2003 Server to work in a paravirtualized
environment, but can't release it w/o MS permission.

Subject: [PLUG] three e1000s in a box, only two work
Message-ID: <20060912042104.GP32165@merlot.com>

I'm working remotely on a box that has three Intel NICs, two on the
motherboard and one card. It finds all of the NICs, but doesn't load a
driver for the third.

The _OSC stuff is ACPI hotplug-related. I have not looked too deeply
into this; the PCI Express NICs load fine, and that's that the hotplug
is looking for, I think.

Here's the modprobe.conf:

  alias scsi_hostadapter adp94xx
  alias eth0 e1000
  alias eth1 e1000
  alias eth2 e1000

Strangely, the adp94xx and eth0 show up on the same IRQ, and the BIOS
won't allow the Adaptec card's interrupt to be forced.

Oh, yeah, it's a dual dual-core Xeon system, running CentOS 4.4 with the
-34 kernel. 

I'm stuck. The e1000 doesn't have an option for setting the IRQs. The
adp94xx doesn't seem to either, but I haven't been able to find the
source that corresponds to this CentOS build.

Any ideas?

TIA!

I am fairly new to Linux, but I did look at the /sbin/lspci directory and
found nothing. I don't know for sure if I am doing something wrong or what.
I know that the Operating system doesn't even acknowledge a wireless card
for the computer.

Try this:

* First, download the windows driver

* Unzip to a directory and remember where you put it.

* Open a terminal window, cd to that directory and run ?ndiswrapper -i 
bcmwl5.inf? as root. This should install configure ndiswrapper to use 
the driver and copy the nessecary files to the right locations.

* run ?ndiswrapper -m? to make the ndiswrapper kernel module load at boot.

* you should now have a ?wlan0? interface that you can configure to fit 
your router config.

Cheers!

lspci is not a directory, it is a command.  It is similar to ls but
for the pci bus.
issue the /sbin/lspci command.  On most system you will get about 1-2 screens
full of information. You will get stuff a lot like this from your system.

02:05.0 Ethernet controller: Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip
21142/43 (rev 41)

Just because the hardware scan doesn't auto-load a driver doesn't mean
it doesn't
know how to handle it.  Wireless on Linux except for the old
orinco/prisum chipsets are typically a trial to get going.  Even then
you have to do a lot of manual configuration.

Subject: [PLUG] VPN from Mac to Linux
Message-ID: <20060912073718.GA10499@gate.kl-ic.com>


A few weeks ago, I decommissioned my sister's Windows box with
extreme prejudice, ridding the world of one more virus bot.  I
replaced it with a Mac Mini, since I could not talk her into
running Linux.  Sigh.

Now I want to be able to do some admin on the box remotely, without
driving from Beaverton to Gresham.   I admin 2 other Linux boxes
remotely through OpenVPN tunnels drilled from those machines to my
server.

There is an OpenVPN client for Mac OSX, the TUN interface for which
seems to break when Apple upgrades OS-X.  Their "natural" VPN seems
to be a flavor of PPTP (with IPSec?  Not sure, still learning).  The
Mac can also drill a PPP connection over an SSH tunnel, apparently.  
While I don't want to open up more incoming ports on my server,
and support a second protocol for VPN, I also don't want to fight
a mostly-proprietary operating system to keep the connection going
after OS upgrades.

So this is a judgment question, for folks that do this kind of
thing more often:  Which approach is wisest from the reliability
and security standpoint: (1) OpenVPN, (2) PPTP, (3) SSH/PPP ?

I'm curious: does standard ssh not meet your needs?

I got a lot of garbage characters, don't know why...

Anyways, is anyone in the wireless ethernet adapter
market flicking Windows support and focusing on OSS
systems directly instead?  USB2 at 400mbps is faster
than 802.11n isn't it?  Is it that hard to make a
USB2 device that's Linux friendly?  I suppose external
scsi is another option, if it's fast enough, to connect
a wireless device to one's computer.  Firewire comes to 
mind, a form of scsi for streaming digital content.

Whether it's madwifi, linuxant, or ndiswrapper: the focus
is on using cards designed for Windows, possibly Mac as 
well, but not Linux under Linux.  The comment about getting 
laughed at when asking for Linux drivers seems like a 
perfectly good reason for someone to start producing 
wireless hardware and specifically target it at the OSS 
community.  What drives the producers of wireless chipsets 
to be proprietary and essentially aligned with Microsoft?  

Microsoft essentially owns all of the successfull proprietary 
OS'es these days, as far as I can tell.  Microsoft may even 
have a controlling interest in MacOS.  Microsoft doesn't 
control Nintendo, Sony, etc., but these are game console 
producers that don't provide real competition to Windows 
and MacOS.

What does it take to convince a hardware manufacturer to produce
a device that anyone can write fully featured GPL'ed drivers for?
Whoever figures out the answer to that question has the potential
to open wireless up substantially for the OSS community.
 
Get away from using arcane virtualization techniques to drive 
wireless hardware, wireless hardware becomes more appropriate for 
applications where reliability is key.  How many expensive mission
critical servers are there these days that rely heavily on wireless 
technology?  Imagine Linux kernel drivers for the latest 
wireless hardware supporting all the latest features that won't 
taint the kernel because they are GPL licensed.  Has anyone released 
hardware drivers for Windows XP under the the GNU general public 
license version 2 or later?

It sounds like Keith might be hoping for a standing incoming connection 
from the mac, which would allow him to initiate an ssh (or maybe also 
vnc) connection from his end.  I haven't tried ssh/ppp on the mac, but 
it has served me well in many other situations.

If the issue is an intermittent network (e.g. dialup), having a standing 
incoming connection whenever the remote box is on is about the only 
answer.  Ditto for firewalls (not that I'm aware of any ISP's that 
block incoming ssh.)

If it is just a matter of dynamic IP, dyndns.com can help you out with a 
free DNS address that can be updated as the IP changes.

Aaaah, be careful though; CPU flags can lie.  I found out that hard way
recently when I upgraded my workstation.  I assumed that any full P4
w/EMT64 would naturally include Hyperthreading.  The mobo BIOS announced
that HT is enabled when it boots, but for the life of me, I couldn't get
an SMP kernel to recognize more than 1 CPU.

Notice the 'ht'?  Surely it must support Hyperthreading!  Wrong.  The

Hi,

I'm part of the e1000 development team at Intel here in Hillsboro and maybe I 
can help you out (I should hope so, or course). We have a development list for 
e1000 too - see e1000.sf.net and e1000-devel at lists.sourceforge.net.

Can you include the lspci -vv output for me?

I would suggest disabling pciehp - PCI Express Hotplug support in the kernel 
for now, I've seen many problems with it. Double check that your NIC is 
actually inserted correctly into the slot as well.

Also, you should enable MSI support to resolve the shared interrupt issue with 
the adp94xx, hopefully that will help.

Cheers,

Auke

First off, don't shoot the messenger.

The lack of monitor repair shops on every corner is a big indicator.

However, I have had several conversations with some shops in the past, 
and what I related in my first message was almost verbatim what I was told.

It's extremely difficult to get someone to pay more for a repair than it 
would cost to purchase new. At $75 an hour bench rate, it's not too 
difficult to imagine a repair costing $300, plus parts. When I can get a 
19" LCD for less, repair just isn't an economic option.

No, actually, I believe it's illegal to do that. Most electronics 
contain heavy metals that must NOT be thrown in a landfill.

Every one I have ever tried (hundreds) has worked flawlessly. You make 
it sound like working with Linux is hard.

As for any LCD monitor, what Linux distribution does not support 
1280X1024 @ 60hz? That's the native resolution of virtually all 19" LCD 
monitors.

Oh it'll be valid. It might not be current, but it would be valid.

The motivation is to keep the stockholders happy. As is the motivation 
of any publically traded company. The stockholders are the ones the 
C?O's answer too.

No, they outsource their manufacturing, like 90% of the rest of the 
technology sector.

Which brings us back to our original point. Most likely, it will be less 
expensive for you to replace your monitor. Even 2 hours on the bench 
with minimal parts and you are looking at nearly $200 for the repair.

I'm just talking about reality here. Don't shoot the messenger. It's not 
my fault that the bench rates required to make a living wage make repair 
a not viable alternative.

Unless you have a trade for services you'd like to offer the repair 
shop, but most of them like to take cash, not chickens.

Based on my experience with 64 bit CentOS, I would avoid 64 bit unless
you have a compelling reason for it.  I've been tripped up enough times
by 64 bit issues to make me regret having done a 64 bit install.  No
doubt things are better now than a year ago when I install, but I'd
still think twice before installing 64 bit.

I'm only one example but I'm running what's theoretically a 64 bit 
Ubuntu (on AMD) and the only trouble I've had was getting firefox+flash 
to work; that took about 10 minutes to fix and it's been no trouble 
since.  If I didn't need the flash I'd have had no troubles whatsoever.

Ahh, I've been waiting for this... My 64-bit AMD runs sweetly with
gentoo.  There were some issues a year ago, but they have largely
disappeared.  You asked for binaries, so this is not technically an
answer.  But 64-bit gentoo is a strongly viable option.

The only issues still lingering that I personally run into concern video
codecs.  win32codecs is still only available in 32-bit form, which means
you need to use mplayer-bin to view wma files.  This means that
mplayerplug-in for mozilla is not terribly useful for this type of video
file.  With the advent of 64-bit windows, you'd think that win32codecs
will become available in 64-bit form.

My workaround for this is to visit a page with such a video, right-click
and view source, copy the video's link, and then open mplayer-bin in a
shell with the link in the command line.

I guess that those who use their computer for a lot of video-watching
would argue that 64-bit is a pain, but all other uses seem to be well in
hand in gentoo.  Ruby support was a bit behind a year ago, but now it's
right-on.  I once had an issue getting the latest php 5.x, but that was
also a year ago.  Same with mozilla.  OpenOffice simply won't compile on
a 64-bit CPU, but the openoffice-bin package works dandily, and doesn't
take 24 hours to install.

Dunno about your nic.  If you can find a CD distro that can see your
nic, you can use it to install gentoo.  There's no real need to use a
gentoo install CD.  I much prefer to use a knoppix CD for gentoo
installs.

Another bonus: you don't get stuck with a distro kernel.  I really
dislike those.

Thanks for the kind offer. The owner of the server wiped it and reloaded
it with the entire CentOS 4.4 including all of the kitchen sink options,
and now it sees all the NICs. 

I'd like to understand what happened, but I don't know if I'll get that
opportunity now.

So you have a BCM4318 chipset which should work with the newest kernels
2.6.17+
If you are running something older then think about grabbing a copy of
the kernel
tree and building it yourself.

Web site that is did the driver.
http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/

A walk thru on getting it up and running inside ndiswrapper on ubuntu
http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=190177

With fc5 you might just want to plug the laptop into an ethernet connection long
enough to run yum update which should get a later kernel that should
have support
for that chip set.  The cds have a 2.6.15 kernel but the latest update
is 2.6.17.3

Also if you do get it to work read this page and send them the
details. They would
like to know.

There is a HOWOT on the Fedora Forum for how to get this wireless card 
chipset working under FC5:

Message-ID: <da2207740609122247w5aa4ee6ei2f238511aa072d12@mail.gmail.com>

Hey folks-

I tried to send a fairly big message with some txt dumps right in the
message body, but it bounced because the mailserv thought it was spam.  So,
should I attach the dumps as .txt files or will those get rejected too?
(just some CLI output, and a couple config files).

Also, any hints on how to avoid being bounced?  Keywords, punctuation, etc?

Anyway, here is the first part of the message before the dumps...
----

I have a Powerbook G3/400mhz/320MB "Lombard" running Ubuntu 6.06.

This one did not have airport capability so I have a Belkin 54G wireless
card.  The card works fine with the laptop in OS X.
Only problem is, and I'm not sure if it's hw or sw related, it will
disconnect at seemingly random intervals in OS X.
More than likely it is the driver, which is 3rd party and not "blessed" by
Apple so YMMV... anyway...

So, I swapped out the HD and put Ubuntu on a new drive.
Works quite well for its age, still has a nice crisp 14" LCD, DVD/CD, etc
etc, runs GNOME decently.

I'm having problems getting WPA working.
I tried the Ubunto forums, so far the stuff I have seen on there has not
helped.

Here is a snippet of output when I run wpa_supplicant on CLI with -d for
verbose debug.
I don't know what is up with the PRISM2_IOCTL_HOSTAPD stuff, I don't have
anything set for HOSTAP...?
The part further down about "wpa_driver_hostap_set_key: [blah blah] ...
Failed to set encryption." looks like it could be part of the problem,
though I'm not sure where it could be going wrong.
In my wpa_supplicant.conf I have the WPA key copied exactly as it is shown
in the router config (Linksys WRT54G running DD-WRT),
and also a version of it passed through wpa_passphrase, and neither one
works (alternating by comment "#" out one at a time).

Oh yes WPA works with Mac OS X and Winders (on different machine) so its
probably not the router.

There's been a fair amount of churn lately.  You probably want to grab a 
more modern installer.  While we're talking modern, maybe give the 
memory stick boot a shot:

  http://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/en.i386/ch04s04.html

I seem to have zero notes on what I did to get my own stick going, so it 
must have been fairly painless -- well, something about not actually 
need an iso image on it.  I know I did the "hard way" instructions 
because I was using 128MB stick.  IIRC, I grabbed a tarball out of the 
installer maze or maybe mounted an ISO and copied stuff from that.

For extra points, figure out how to add an /etc/hosts entry on the stick 
for your apt-proxy server and report back.

You can paste text content on the following website, so long as it 
doesn't contain anything "too sensitive".  If you were trying to paste 
it to the PLUG list, which is publicly archived, I would assume there 
wouldn't be anything too bad in it:
http://pastebin.ca/

Pastebin issues you with a URL that you could then paste into the email. 
  You can also do things like password protect it and/or set an expiry date.

Thanks, I was thinking of something along those lines but not sure exactly
what I was looking for ;).

Are you using the sarge installer? I've found that etch works and 
plays well with a much broader ranger of hardware. At work, we've got 
some newer machines with Intel 82573L NICs. Etch worked but sarge was 
having no part of it. :-)

As for 32 vs. 64 bits, I've yet to encounter a killer reason for 
loading a 64-bit environment. (That doesn't mean there isn't one; I 
just haven't encountered it.) I run 32-bit kernels and userspace on 
all our Opterons with nothing but good luck.

You might try the HostAP mailing list and/or archives as well to see if 
there's any relevant information there you can use.

Bingo!

Note that the Linux Clinic is this Sunday 1-5PM at Free Geek.  Come on

Message-ID: <9e0a35780609130925g135ae339p368a5cef9f2e4ead@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone know how I would configure a PXE server to not delete a
particular pre-existing partition, if I want to do a reinstall?

For example, if I have an existing system, but I want to do a PXE install to
get a new OS, I don't want it to delete /home, for example.

Thanks!

It depends on the installer, i.e. Kickstart, systemimager or trained
monkey.  Doesn't matter if you're using PXE, CD-ROM or whatever to load
the installer.

Maybe, but I'm not trying to run HostAP mode, that's part of why I am
confused.
I just want to connect to the router using WPA.  I will give their archives
a gander,
but I don't want to run HostAP, just connect Managed mode with WPA.

Drew,

   It's 1.3.37 (or something close to that).

   Regardless, I figured it out this afternoon; it's one of those
head-slapping situations: so dumb it's embarrassing to let people know about
it.

   When I open the file, /var/www/htdocs/appl-ecosys/index.shtml, there are
no included files because the server is not providing the pages. The browser
client is displaying the page. D'oh! As soon as I changed the URL to
http://localhost/appl-ecosys/index.shtml, there were the menus and footer.
Sigh. Just goes to show how infrequently I look at the site locally.

   I now return you to more important things.

Rich

Has anyone here used Mantis(www.mantisbt.org)?  If so, I'd be interested
in hearing your experiences.  I'm trying to determine if it can be
configured appropriately for our business.  I need to be able to track
both hardware and software problems for multiple projects with multiple
clients.  We're not a call center, and clients are unlikely to be
entering or viewing bugs.  The thing that is a little different from 
typical bug tracking needs is the extra level of hierarchy created by
having lots of clients.  I want to be able to separate projects by 
client.  If all projects from all clients were grouped together, it
would eventually get unwieldy.

Bugzilla and scarab appear to be overly complex for my needs.  I've
also briefly looked at gnats, rt, and roundup, but mantis seemed to
be the best fit.

thanks,
galen

Galen,

   Trac? I've seen reports that it's configurable and works well.

I patched Mantis to allow multiple subdomains, each with its own
database. The main codebase is shared, but none of the data. Do you need
to run aggregate reports, or are per-client reports OK? If the subdomain
separation is something you might like, I'll send you the patch. I think
it's about 12 lines.

If you're saying that you want each client-project pair to have its own
distinct list of bugs, I'm sure you could do that with clever project
and version list configuration.

Mantis is a really nice bug tracker.

As Dr. Shepard suggested, Trac is great for integrating a wiki, bug
tracking, and Subversion. Mantis is just a bug tracker.

Per-client reports should be sufficient for our needs.  Thanks for the
offer of the patch, but I think I'd better experiment with a standard
install first.  If that goes well, I'll ask for the patch.

No, we don't need to do that.

I will check out Trac as well.

Thanks for the feedback.

A friend of mine asked if anyone knew of a utility to open an MDB
file.  This is the Access extension, I believe.  It has a password on
it.  Anyone know?  The file in question is here:

The wpa_supplicant daemon doesn't just support just the Host AP wireless 
driver. I guess the mailing list name is a bit confusing though. I use the 
wpa_supplicant daemon to get WPA-PSK to work on my laptop which uses the 
Intel ipw2200 driver.

Message-ID: <ee892c770609151000m14f2a614r1327ee4719149068@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I just got Minicom up and running sucesfully for console access into cisco
routers. I want to know if there is a way to use a "cut and paste" feature
within the program?

There is sometimes a need, if an interface goes down, to cut the config from
the bad interface, and paste it to an available one.

Or, is there another hyperterminal program people prefer. FYI, I am running
knoppix locally on a toshiba laptop.

Thanks for any help

Joe

There are also a bunch of SD -> USB adaptors out there that function like
USB storage.

I have a multi-memory PCMCIA adaptor that I picked up at a camera shop for
cheap.  Works great with Linux and has for the past 4-5 years.

Have you looked at Request Tracker? http://bestpractical.com/rt/.  It
is fairly popular as a general ticketing system and can also be used
for bug tracking (for example rt.cpan.org).  It does support multiple
queues which could be separated by client.  I am not sure if it
handles different projects

I picked up a random 18$ 211231252352436-in-1 external card reader at my local 
computer store (ENU to be exact). Works out of the box. Maybe not as handy as 
the pcmcia reader (it has a cable, how archeaic!) but it works OOTB.

Are you running minicom from within a terminal in the X window manager 
or just standard terminals (ie. <ctrl>+<alt>+<f1>)?  If you're in X, 
doesn't highlighting the source text with the mouse and then 
middle-clicking in the destination window work?

If you need to maintain certain word-wrap properties, you can make a 
capture/log file of all communications in minicom by using the "-C 
<filename>" option and then use a program like gedit or kedit to 
highlight the source text?

Cheers,

I had trouble with an older multi-media reader a while ago.  It had
SmartMedia and CompactFlash slots, but annoyingly would not find the
inserted CompactFlash device unless SmartMedia was inserted at the
same time.  I got around this by just leaving the useless 8 or 16meg
SmartMedia that came with my digital camera in the reader.
Eventually, I got a special purpose CF reader to eliminate the
confusion.

I'm pretty confident I could plug in pretty much any usb CF reader and
have it work in moments (my camera acts just like a cf reader, and it
works) but I'm specifically looking for something that will not take
up additional space, and a flush pcmcia solution would be perfect.

It looks as though I'll just end up buying one that looks reasonable
from newegg and report back.

Thanks for the suggestions,
Rogan

Thanks for the reply,

I was selecting the application minicom (X11) out of a list of apps under
KDE. There was also just plain Minicom listed there. When i openend that one
up and configured it, the cut and paste feature worked!
So, i gave the configuration a name, and can execute and run Minicom within
a terminal.

Hope this makes sence, im still a bit new to Linux. Just trying to get more
comfortable with it for network tasks, as well as other things.

Thanks Again,

Joe

My multi-slot reader requires a certain kernel config parameter set
to "Y" to allow access to all the SCSI devices:

CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN:

If you have a SCSI device that supports more than one LUN (Logical
Unit Number), e.g. a CD jukebox, and only one LUN is detected, you
can say Y here to force the SCSI driver to probe for multiple LUNs.
A SCSI device with multiple LUNs acts logically like multiple SCSI
devices. The vast majority of SCSI devices have only one LUN, and
so most people can say N here. The max_luns boot/module parameter
allows to override this setting.

Symbol: SCSI_MULTI_LUN [=y]
Prompt: Probe all LUNs on each SCSI device
   Defined at drivers/scsi/Kconfig:167
   Depends on: SCSI
   Location:
     -> Device Drivers
       -> SCSI device support
         -> SCSI device support (SCSI [=y])

I don't think that wasn't my problem though.  MULTI_LUN was ON.  The
problem seemed to be that it hung up on the first LUN and never made
it to the later ones.  The SmartMedia had to have media in it to make
it past to the CompactFlash.  Newer kernels may have fixed this, I
haven't checked.  I saw the problem about a year ago.

Come to think of it, I do have an annoying issue where, in order to
mount the SD slot at /dev/sdd1, I have to first attempt to mount, and
fail, every LUN from sda1 to sde1.  Then it will "see" sdd1 and allow me
to mount.  This problem showed up fairly recently.  I might have to check
which SCSI config options I might have changed from module to built-in.

Message-ID: <1158385036.3834.6.camel@zowie.fnordora.org>

September 2006 Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced topics meeting 

Speaker: Ted Kubaska

Topic:   introduction to Eclipse 3.2

This talk is an introduction to Eclipse 3.2. It assumes that you know
what Eclipse is and may even have installed it and cruised its menus,
that you have not done anything serious with it, but that you might want
to. Eclipse is both an IDE and an RCP (a starting platform for your own
applications). Although I'll mention and define RCP, the talk is about
using Eclipse as an IDE. I'll show how to use Eclipse to build a simple
Java console application. As an IDE, it allows you to add your own
plug-ins. The talk will also show how to add a simple plug-in. This talk
is cribbed from various books; little if any of it is original.

Time: 
        7pm until 9pm or so. ***NOTE*** There is a party before us that ends at 7pm, so we may start a bit late.

Date: 
        Monday September 18th 2006

Location:
        Jax [Restaurant]
        826 SW 2nd Ave
        Portland, OR

        On the MAX Line, next to Bally's Fitness.  This is one block  
up and over from Paddy's.

This is a bit late, but then I'm way behind on a bunch of things.  
Anyway, just 'cause no one mentioned it, the Ars Technica system guide 
is a good place to look for ideas, tips, and inspiration on building 
your own system.  Ars divides its guide into three categories (Budget 
Box, Hot Rod Box, and God Box) and updates it frequently, the most 
recent update being last month.  I like checking it out regardless of 
whether I'm shopping for anything, simply because it's interesting to 
see what's out there, what's considered cutting-edge or hot, what's 
considered solid and a good value, and so on.  The comments are usually 
worth checking out also.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.64.0609160924570.6251@orange.madboa.com>

Some time ago, I'd begun to think that perhaps the Gentoo package 
system on my SPARC had become somewhat corrupted. (Snip long story 
about SunBlades and IDE corruption...) Queries concerning installed 
packages seemed to execute correctly, but "emerge -uvD world" seemed 
to ignore packages that really needed to be upgraded.

I finally got around to brute-forcing the portage system into querying 
every single installed package to see if it was in need of an update. 
The resulting pipe sequence is convoluted and takes a while to run, 
but it seems to do the job. Oh, and you'll also need to have the epm 
ebuild installed.

   epm -qGa |\
   sed -e 's/-r[0-9][0-9]*$//' -e 's/-[^-]*$//' |\
   sort -u |\
   (while read n; do emerge -puv "$n"; done) |\
   grep -w ebuild

In semi-plain English, the procedure is

1. Get list of all installed ebuilds, complete with group name
2. Remove release and version numbers from ebuild names
3. Remove duplicates, common with slotted ebuilds
4. Loop over each ebuild name looking for updates
5. Important output from emerge has word "ebuild" in the string

It's unlikely that this will help anyone else, but who knows? :-)

Won't pick up slotted updates offhand; also, I'd personally just feed 
the list directly to emerge instead of invoking it each time.

For resolving, portage has to load up the old style virtuals- to do 
this, it has to walk the entire vdb, so your scriptlet above is in 
effect a N^2 walk of the vdb (ouch).

Depending on how many packages you have, you might be better off doing

emerge --sync; emerge -ev world

which essentially figures out the whole dependency tree and recompiles
everything from the leaves up to the root. With all the stuff I have installed,
it takes about 48 hours on a 933 MHz Pentium.

Incidentally, if you haven't bitten the gcc 4 bullet, you'll end up recompiling
everything anyhow, so there's no good reason to do it *twice*!

Leaves being defined as what is in world; it's actually _not_ every 
package on the system, since you can have packages not in world 
(emerge --oneshot or ebuild /path/to/ebuild usage), or have the 
resultant 'empty' graph from the tree no longer including nodes in 
the vdb.

Example of the latter would be that you had pkg x-1 merged which 
needed y, x-2 no longer needs y thus y doesn't show up in the graph 
unless you've forced it into the world file yourself.

What about system packages?  Does "emerge -ev world" get these?

root at sphinktoo:/var/lib/portage# emerge -ep system |wc
     259    1038   11171
root at sphinktoo:/var/lib/portage# emerge -ep `cat /var/lib/portage/world` |wc
    1061    4258   47724
root at sphinktoo:/var/lib/portage# emerge -ep world |wc
    1071    4299   48068

Judging from this output, "emerge -e world" gets a little bit of stuff
that "emerge -e `cat /var/lib/portage/world`" does not.  It would take
some sifting to identify the missing 10 packages.

The output from both these emerge world variants do indeed contain
enough system packages to imply that they do, in fact, get them.
module-init-tools, file, busybox and others are in the mix.

I'm throwing the `cat world` method out there because it is a way to
re-create a gentoo box with all the packages of another gentoo box.
Once the base system is built, you can copy the first system's world
file to the second system and run the emerge command.  When I hosed my
dev workstation, I backed up my data and world file and used this
method to re-create the load from a fresh build.  The result was
pleasantly identical to the original (but without the hose-factor).

I have always wondered how to do this on a debian (apt-based) system.
Anyone know?  I switched to gentoo before getting to the bottom of it.

But for the usual repair jobs, "emerge -e world" has the slight edge,
winning by 10 packages on my system.

I believe it's referred to as the AUTH port.  Thing is, my general impression
is that it's never been a working authentication protocol and that most info
on google suggests rejecting queries to it.  How about for masqueraded clients
that want to query a remote AUTH server?

I don't understand why an entire protocol was needed to automate logging in
for various TCP/IP services such as the: ftp and telnet services.

Message-ID: <1158440997.450c6825d5c7e@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Skype on MacOSX 10.3 doesn't stay online.  There appears to be no way to
keep it online.  This does not appear to be an issue for Windows Skype.
I haven't seen this issue pop up for Linux Skype either.

I can only enter a number as large as 9999 for the number of minutes to
wait before the status changes to, "user is away."  This makes it 
impossible for people to skype you.  Think of a phone that automatically 
goes off hook unless you frequently attend to it.

Is the MacOSX release of Skype still in beta?

I give the skype producers an F for documentation.

Uhm, I don't care about Vista and I am not impressed by the poor proofreading
job of whoever edited the piece this link points to.  Congress should act now
to enforce the Sherman Anti Trust Act so that retailers can't bundle Vista with
new computers or otherwise impose a Microsoft tax.  Vista shouldn't be
preinstalled on a computer unless the buyer wants it.  Furthermore, no
version of Windows should be installed and no Microsoft tax should be paid
by consumers that don't want Windows preinstalled to a new computer.  OEM
copies of Windows should be outlawed period.  It's a shame that almost every
retail computer with Windows preinstalled is an OEM installation.  The biggest
problem with an OEM copy of Windows is that NOONE TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
SUPPORTING IT, INCLUDING THE INSTALLER.  This is especially true with Fry's.

My definition of the God machine is one that lets you do with Linux everything
you thought only Windows or MacOS-X could do and more that you like but never
knew about.  It's a cheap cop out to give advice on building a great Windows
system.  All IBM PC compatible computer hardware is designed for Windows and
Windows only.  No matter how hot a Windows or MacOSX system is, the
owner of that system is still trapped in EULA hell if they don't switch to
either Linux or FreeBSD.

I can't figure out how to get Freedos 1.0 under Fedora Core 5 using this site.
It requires a special downloader.  There don't appear to be any instructions
to compile this downloader under Linux let alone any rpm releases, which is
strange considering that the software is supposedly GPL'ed.  It's irritating
that MS Windows systems are the only ones listed as compatible platforms.
MacOS-X doesn't even appear to be listed as a compatible platform.

What is wrong with the standard methods of downloading large software packages
that have made the e-mule downloader necessary?

What is up with me not being to download a copy of Freedos 1.0 from ibiblio
without corrupting it?  Lately, I can't even start a download from ibiblio.
It is as if I got blacklisted.

I'm a heavy Skype user (I call Zimbabwe and make other international  
calls about once a week) and I'm running version 1.4.0.49 on my  
MacBook Pro, which Skype says is the latest OSX version. I guess the  
obvious thing to do would be to upgrade to OSX 10.4.7 (10.4.8 is due  
out in the next week or so, I hear). There are a LOT of reasons to  
move to 10.4, not the least of which is that all of the traditional  
*nix commands work on Apple forked files as a single unit, so you  
don't have to remember to do the "special" versions of cp, mv, etc.  
At any rate, considering my experience with Skype, my first suspect  
would be the very old version of OSX (you are at least at 10.3.9,  
right?).

Yeah.. it requires an eDonkey client (hence the ed2k:// uri..), of
which eMule is one of many, and it appears that eMule is windows-only.

There is *nothing* about the GPL which requires (or even suggests)
multi-OS releases.  Porting is a lot of work, especially if you don't
personally use the platform you're porting to.

> What is wrong with the standard methods of downloading large software packages

Bandwith.  eMule is one of a number of peer-to-peer networking clients
that allow the bandwith hit to be spread across many voulnteer
connections.  The groups that create and (initially) host projects
such as freedos or other distros have to pay for their bandwith usage
some how, and since they aren't making loads of cash through the
effort of compiling these tools / OSes, they've wisely opted for a
distribution mechanism that most people are perfectly happy with,
often produces faster download speeds, is far more robust, and it's
much, much cheaper.

I think there is more to it, but `dpkg --get-selections` (or the reverse
--set-selections) is most of the equivalent. I think there is more data
hiding in `aptitude`, but the above will at least get you the package
manager's view. You can also get debconf settings with
`debconf-get-selections`.

This has nothing to do with MS.  This is a retailer gripe.

This is not very accurate.  Linux and BSD don't have drivers for 
everything not because of MS, but in most cases because of other patent 
or IP reasons.  MS pays for a lot of their features, which in turn is 
paid for by us.  Take Linspire for example, or any other pay-for version 
of a Linux based OS that is able to play DVD's and MP3's out of the box. 
  They're not free technologies.  It's why a lot of gaming consoles that 
play DVD's require an extra dongle.  You're buying the right to play it, 
and it kept the cost of the original equipment down.

	installing Debian into swap partition, but MAKEDEV is missing
Message-ID: <659b9ea30609172118t12ba0879xec1ef6865a856e65@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I was at the Linux Clinic today; thanks to everyone who showed up.
That was fun.  Great group of people.

I talked to Aaron about installing Debian into a swap partition in
order to upgrade my SuSE 6.0 toshiba portege 3015CT.  I got partway
through the installation noted here:

http://www.underhanded.org/papers/debian-conversion/remotedeb.html

However, when I attempt to install debootstrap (which I downloaded)
the script complains about a missing /dev/MAKEDEV script.  I copied
the one from my ubuntu laptop, and ran it, but I get a "/dev/MAKEDEV:
dpkg: command not found" error, so it obviously relies on dpkg which I
don't have on that old laptop.

Can anyone suggest an alternative?  It appears that the script needs
to make a tarball of the devices, for what reason I am not sure.

Chris

Well, one of the major points of using Freedos, it's not like I don't have 
a copy of MS-DOS around, is to be in a safer licensing situation.  It only
seems logical for a Freedos download site to focus on supporting people who 
want to access it from a similarly open source platform.  I've enjoyed the 
pre 1.0 release, one of my interests has been getting the source code and
studying it.  I'd like to help the Freedos people continue development
if possible.

I have a hunch that ibiblio isn't working because of a port 113 issue,
but that is just a hunch.  I really don't get how the whole port 113
mess got started and why it is still a problem today.

Thanks for the answer Rogan.

September 2006 Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced topics meeting

Speaker: Ted Kubaska

Topic:   introduction to Eclipse 3.2

This talk is an introduction to Eclipse 3.2. It assumes that you know
what Eclipse is and may even have installed it and cruised its menus,
that you have not done anything serious with it, but that you might want
to. Eclipse is both an IDE and an RCP (a starting platform for your own
applications). Although I'll mention and define RCP, the talk is about
using Eclipse as an IDE. I'll show how to use Eclipse to build a simple
Java console application. As an IDE, it allows you to add your own
plug-ins. The talk will also show how to add a simple plug-in. This talk
is cribbed from various books; little if any of it is original.

Time:
       7pm until 9pm or so. ***NOTE*** There is a party before us that ends
at 7pm, so we may start a bit late.

Date:
       Monday September 18th 2006

I'm pretty sure you can solve the first part via ACPI support. I think it
would amount to placing a script in /etc/acpi/events/<something> which
gets executed when AC power is removed. I'm pretty sure the kernel will
see this, and you'd need a pretty simple script to make it hibernate.

The wakeup is trickier. It might involve going into the BIOS and telling
it to wakeup on power restoration. There /might/ also be a way to do this
via ACPI, but I don't know where to start besides ACPI.

Subject: [PLUG] route-ethX format ( Redhat-ian distributions )
Message-ID: <45100130.1040700@acm.org>

I have a system ( Linux-Vserver ) with three NICs and need to make sure 
traffic to/from each guest stays on its NIC.  There will be three 
networks, one on the 192.168.0.0, and the other two on separate networks.

All the examples I've found on the format in the route-ethX file don't 
appear applicable for what I need to do.

Can anyone provide a example of how to route all traffic for the 
192.168.0.0 network through eth2?  I'm pretty sure I can sort out the 
other two from.  :-)


TIA,
Rod

Don't know which examples you've found not to work for you, but these
are the two I've known to work:

10.65.42.0/25 via 10.65.42.126 dev eth0

GATEWAY0=10.65.42.126
NETMASK0=255.255.255.128
ADDRESS0=10.65.42.0

Quick snip from some notes, IIRC the latter version is the
current-used format in RHEL4*.  Check the network-functions and
ifup/ifdown scripts to see what's currently sourced from the
route-${INT} files and used to create static routes.

Did you try bumping up the LogLevel to something obscene, like 
"debug"?

Also, I assume that you fully (not just gracefully) restarted Apache, 
right?

Sorry for asking the bonehead questions...

So, I've been testing this with FireFox. When I navigate to the page it
prompts me with 
  "You have chosen to open <blank lines> 
   which is a: application/x-httpd-php
   from: http://www.patch.com

   What should Firefox do ...

But if I use Konqueror it loads fine. 

WTF?

You can specify a global LogLevel; in my config files, it's usually 
found near the User and Group declarations. The server-level 
declaration can be overridden in each virtual host.

Thanks Eli.

I didn't try them.  The systems I have to get them working are _running_ 
  ( one is physically a long way away ) so experimenting in ignorance 
didn't seem like a good idea.  :-)

    Also the examples I found ( if I remember correctly ) did stuff like 
10.10.0.0 via 216.60.189.23

> 10.65.42.0/25 via 10.65.42.126 dev eth0

For the network challenged is 10.65.42.126 the gateway?

Thanks again.  I was looking at them earlier today.  Now I'll look more 
carefully and with a clue.

That link contained the thread with a deja vu description of my problem.

It could be used as the gateway or .1 as well ... so to answer your question
yes it is

I have sucessfully detected the USB flash devices. :) I could not
mount them because
all of them have BSD file systems on them that I was testing  from freenas as a
USB boot device.

The question I would ask; are you getting no detection from the front panel or
rear?  Another question; does the bios have the usb ports turned off?

  my latex-beamer presentation in pdf.
 
 I have tried several things and none works so far, I see in both
monitors, in full screen, 
 the same output, even when I change the display setting and I 
 choose monitor one (my computer one) to be the default one and
 I choose monitor two (the wall screen) to extend my windows desktop

 I wonder if somebody knows something about the configuration of the
projector or the monitors or the settings
 or the video card or something that can be of help.
 
I appreciate your help in this matter.

Tried front panel (the ones on the motherboard) as well as the front
panel ones through the header.  They are turned on in BIOS.  I get
detection messages of the motherboard USB hardware during boot, with
some error message noise.  I have an external hub plugged which shows
power on its LED.  But if I plug anything in (either to the hub or any
of the other ports) such as a USB storage stick, I get a very brief
blink on the stick LED and then it goes off.  Nothing shows in
/var/log/messages.  Nothing shows in udevmonitor.  Same thing on a
slightly old (spring-ish) Knoppix V5.0DVD as well as 2.6.17.13 and
2.6.18-rc7.  On USB developer's advice (based on that error message
noise I didn't quite understand), I've tried removing the ehci-hcd
module, but that doesn't help either.

Would you mind running dmidecode on one you have tested as working and
mailing me the results so I can compare with mine?

Thanks a lot for the help!

If running linux, you could run separate x-servers on each monitor.
Then you will be able to run acrobat in full-screen on the wall while
still using your other screen for notes or whatever.  This does,
however, make it a little difficult to controll the acroread session
(you can pan over with the mouse, of course).  Running a vnc server on
the wall screen X server will let you vnc into it from the "private"
monitor, which would work great if the wall screen is running at a
significantly lower res. than your private screen, even if not, you
could probably deal with it.

There are at least a couple of Linux apps that connect to the network 
eMule uses.  The one I use is aMule:  http://www.amule.org/

Gah!  I meant (of course) that I tried the motherboard mounted ports
in back as well as the front panel ports (connected by the case cables
to the motherboard headers).

I replaced the motherboard with another instance of the same model,
and USB started working.  Looks like a bad controller on the board.

Thanks for your help narrowing down the problem!

Add the following to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth2

GATEWAY0=10.10.0.1 #IP for your eth2 gateway
NETMASK0=255.255.255.0 # netmask for your 192.168.0.0 network
ADDRESS0=192.168.0.0

# These are arrays, so the second set is 1, thrid set is 2, etc.
GATEWAY1=10.10.0.1
NETMASK1=255.255.0.0
ADDRESS1=10.0.0.0

Then you need to restart your network by doing a service network restart.


Hope that helps.

Subject: [PLUG] debugging hyperthreading problems
Message-ID: <e2aeccd60609211127r29cc48c2hceacb914db55898@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All-
I have a Dell 1425SC with a 2.8 Ghz Xeon when I have hyperthreading enabled
if a user initiates a ssh or telnet (I used telnet for testing only) session
and they have bash as their default shell they have to type characters
several times before they output to their terminal program (ie putty). If I
disable hyperthreading or turn off the second CPU in
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online using the kernel hotplug feature
everything acts as it should (no having to repeat characters).

I've ruled out a global profile type issue I believe as when I change the
user to tcsh for instance the issue doesn't show itself. I have recompiled
bash thinking that may have been the issue and I'm still seeing though. I
have upgraded to kernel 2.6.18 with same result. I also thought that perhaps
it might be due to LDAP auth but I added a local shadow passwd user and they
show the same problems as LDAP authenticated users.

Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks,
Drew-

On the Dell, try running sshd in debug, no-fork mode on an alternative 
port:

  /usr/sbin/sshd -d -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config -p 2222

Have the remote user launch a session (using port 2222, or whatever) 
while you keep an eye on the sshd debug output. It may help to add 
extra -d's (-dd or -ddd) to increase verbosity.

You might also try wrapping the debug sshd in strace to catch errant 
system calls:

  strace -o /tmp/sshd.trace /usr/bin/sshd -d [...]

After the session, peek at the sshd.trace file to see if anything 
leaps out.

Subject: [PLUG] Locked out again :(
Message-ID: <4513DD25.3730.5E4B95D4@localhost>

I was trying to use rsync to copy everything on my laptop's Ubuntu-64 
partition (hda2 -- hda1 is a swap partition) to an external 60 GB USB disk. 
Rsync appeared to do the job, but it ended with an error that the disk was 
out of space. The USB disk had lots of space, but I also got several 
popups in the corner of the screen that I was running out of disk space. In 
other words, evidently it was hda2 that was running out of space, not the 
USB disk. I don't understand that, as all rsync should be doing is reading 
the files on hda2. 

When rsync finished I discovered that the keyboard and mouse were 
locked up. I had no choice but to hit the power button. When I restarted I 
got the following error message when I tried to log in: 

"GDM could not write to your authorization file. This could mean that you 
are out of disk space or that your home directory could not be opened for 
writing. In any event, it is not possible to log in. Please contact your 
system administrator." 

I used Ctrl-Alt-F1 to exit to a shell, whereupon I logged in and then deleted 
a number of large files that I knew I had backups of elsewhere -- about 300 
MB worth. Then I went back to the login screen and tried to log in again. 
But I still got the same error message. 


I went back to the shell and did "sudo chown jjj:jjj /home", thinking that 
perhaps permissions had gotten screwed up. The command executed 
normally, but I still cannot log in. 


A possible part of the problem: There appears to be a file or folder (colors 
are not working in the shell) named "--exclude=media." This was part of the 
rsync command I used. I have tried to remove this file or folder, but I cannot 
do so. 


This is all part of a previous problem where I created a hard link between 
hda2 and hda3. Before trying some ideas to resolve that problem I am 
trying to make a complete backup of each partition. I did succeed in using 
kdar to back up /home, but kdar takes forever to configure. In other words, 
using it to back up other folders or the whole partition is not trivial. Plus, it 
is very unstable -- locks up the computer 50% of the time. I tried using cp, 
but it cannot take an --exclude command, so it tries to copy everything on 
/media/usbdisk, while copying to the usbdisk! I also tried tar, but getting 
the --exclude switch to work with tar is beyond me. I can get it to work with 
rsync, but the same syntax does not work with tar, even though the 
documentation shows it as the same. 


Currently I am stuck having to write this on a Windows desktop because I 
can't get into my Linux computer! I really need suggestions!

How about '-n' (or '--dry-run') to preview what's going to happen?

Subject: [PLUG] Newly assembled machine overheating
Message-ID: <4514688F.60405@comcast.net>

I have an overheating processor chip (thank you chip and mother board 
makers for adding temperature sensing and alarms) and need some ideas on 
what might be causing the problem.

I've just assembled a machine:

Soyo IT600 Dragon Ultra mother board with an AMD Athlon XP 2200+ 
processor and a thermaltake Silent Boost chip fan. I used thermal 
grease. The mother board was slightly used, with a different chip, by a 
fellow PLUGer. My processor chip is new, from Computer Geeks.

After checking all the connections, I fired up the machine and got the 
mother board splash screen, hit <DEL> and got into the BIOS. I went 
through the list and found most everything OK the way it was -- I just 
re-ordered the boot sequence (CD-ROM first, Floppy second, HDD, third) 
and disabled the splash screen so I could see what's going on under the 
hood.

That worked fine, and I could see the CPU temperature and the fact that 
the alarm was enabled so I'd know when to start worrying about the CPU 
getting too hot.

It took a fairly long time to finally get around to booting, but 
eventually the SuSE 10.1 install CD booted. I entered the FTP site and 
waited another fairly long time for the process to begin. Just as it 
did, the alarm went off. I aborted the installation and rebooted. The 
processor chip temperature was 44deg C. I recall that the limit is 45, 
so I shut down the machine.

I set the box up on the desk, took the cover off, power it up and 
watched to see if the CPU fan was running: it was, as was the chip set 
fan, the power supply fan, and the two additional case fans.

The only unusual thing that occurred during assembly was that when I 
poked a little hole in the thermal grease packet I must have made two 
holes, one front and one back. I watched a small amount of grease come 
out the front hole, but didn't see about twice as much come out the 
back. The extra grease ran off the chip top and down onto the chip's 
carrier board. There are some little bumps of something that are next to 
the chip top. The grease got on and in between those. I used a q-tip to 
clean up most of it. I was sure to leave grease on the chip top, but I 
don't really know how much there should be.

Any recommendations on what to do next?

Assuming that the 45 degree temperature is at the chip, that's not
very hot at all.  For example, the max die temperature for the 
XP Processor Model 10 with 256K L2 Cache is 85 degrees C for the 2200+
model.  BTW, I can tell you from personal experience that an IC
package at 90 degrees C will burn your finger.

The bumps are most likely decoupling capacitors.  I doubt you caused a
problem with the extra grease.

Double check your alarm settings.  45 degrees C is too low for a chip
overtemperature alarm.

My mistake. The Anti Burn Regulator setting is the Default of 85 deg C, 
no 45. As I type this, I'm watching the temperature and fan speed change 
in the BIOS display. The CPU Temp. External is stable at 36 C / 96 F. 
The CHA Temperature is stable at 25 C / 77 F. The CPU Temp. On Die was 
fluctuating between 42 C and 43 C / 109 F, but is now up to 44 C / 111 
F. The speed of CPUFAN1 is varying between 2766 RPM and 2812 RPM.


I'll try again and see how far I get before an alarm goes off.

I got farther in the SuSE install this time, but not much. The alarm is 
a repeating beep from the case speaker with a duration of about 1 second 
on and one second off. When the alarm went off, I pressed the case reset 
button. The BIOS reported the chip temperature as 46 deg C / 111 deg F. 
While that might not be too hot for the chip, something smells 
electrically warm.

Any other ideas of what to check?

This is just a guess, but could it be an fan RPM alarm?  It's possible
that something like lm-sensors is deciding that the fan speed can be
reduced, and that's tripping the BIOS fan RPM alarm.  Try looking at
the fans while you are doing the install.

I'm doing that as I type.

Any idea which way the air is supposed to flow through the chip fan? The 
fan sits on top of a bunch of copper fins. The air is blowing from the 
case onto the fins. That sounds right. And the case fans are blowing 
into the case.

The installation has going along fine for about an hour. But I have the 
side of the case off. That leads me to wonder if somehow airflow through 
the case is the problem. Would it make any sense to turn one of the case 
fans around so that it exhausts the case?

   Yes. I thought that they were set up that way.

Oops. I put my hand near each and it felt as if the air was blowing on 
my hand. I did the strip of paper test and found that the front fan 
blows in, and the back fan blows out.

I guess that's not the problem.

The installation did finish, although it has it's own problem: GRUB 
Error 18. Apparently this is something that happens when installing to a 
disk drive that has existing partitions on it. The simple solution is to 
erase all the partitions and start over. While not elegant, it will 
allow me to correct one or two mistakes I made during the installation 
process.

Other than quitting at Error 18, the machine has been running fine with 
the side off the case.

If the processor is getting very hot, then the heat sink should be
getting quite hot, too.  If it is not, then there is something blocking
the heat flow to the heat sink, for example a plastic film that is
supposed to be removed to expose a thermally conductive soft plastic.
Or the heat sink isn't properly anchored.  Or you have the wrong kind
of heat sink for your processor.  Or the processor voltage is too high
(check the BIOS for voltages, compare that to the processor type you
have).  Or the motherboard is bad.  Or the processor is bad.  Or ...?

I had a similar overheating problem with my wife's Shuttle ATX.  It
turned out to be a failed fan control on the motherboard.  Fortunately,
there was a second socket for the fan, so I just moved the fan plug to
that second socket.  

Some motherboards have all sorts of controls over fan speed in the BIOS.
Record the current fan settings (so you can restore them), then set the
fans to "high speed all the time".  If they still move slowly, that is
one problem, if they move fast but the chip still gets hot, then it
is probably the heat sink interface, or something not working.

It is a pity that most motherboards don't measure processor CURRENT.
That would tell you if something was broken in the CPU or on your
motherboard.  Still, if the voltage is too LOW, it could indicate
a problem with overcurrent.

The standard thermal greases conduct heat well, but not electricity
(high-conductivity silver-based ones *do* conduct electricity), so that
shouldn't be a problem.

>From your description though, you poked two holes in the packet and then
placed the entire packet between heat sink and processor?

I'm in contact with gamers who tend to go for excessive cooling, but I'm
fairly sure the proper procedure would be to poke one hole in the packet,
so you can direct the flow as you squeeze the thermal grease *directly*
onto the processor. Also you don't want an excessive layer of grease, as
though it conducts heat fairly well, it isn't nearly as good as the heat
sink material.

No. Not the whole packet. I squeezed a small amount out the front hole, 
which stayed in the center of the chip. Twice that amount came out the 
back hole, some of which was on the chip, and some of which got onto the 
capacitors (as identified by Galen in a previous post). I would guess 
that the packet contained about a tablespoon of material. I intended to 
use a quarter a teaspoon or less, but probably ended up with a half 
teaspoon to start with. I cleaned up a little over half of that.

Would that have been on the heat sink? If so, it was removed by the 
previous owner. I wiped a small amount of old grease off the heat sink 
before putting it on the socket.

Anything's possible, but it appears that it's really hard to have this

I haven't actually double checked, but this heat sink fits the socket, 
and looks a lot bigger than the ones pictured on AMD's web site for 
installing the chip. I would think that bigger would work, where smaller 
wouldn't .

Well, that's one I didn't check, either. I'll have to do that tomorrow. 
Again, "I would have thought" that if I had the setting wrong it 
wouldn't have lasted this long. I guess that shows what I don't know. :-)

There is a CPUFAN2 set of pins, but they don't support the variable 
speed. I suppose that isn't necessary if it runs full speed all the 
time. I remember my third computer, a Z-80 with a whopping 5 MB hard 
disk drive, which had a variable speed fan (early 1980's). Eventually, I 
replaced it with a constant speed fan and some problems I was having 
went away.

Thanks for the response. While the machine appears to run fine with the 
side off the case, I don't think I can leave it that way, so I'll have 
to pursue this until I figure it out.

A Z80, sweet!  I had a Timex Sinclair 1000 back in '85 or '86.  I had to
remove the board from the case because it overheated.  The bridge
rectifier was screwed onto a flat aluminum square of metal that served
as the heat sink.  The CPU, a Z80-A running at 4MHz, did not require
any cooling infrastructure.  The overheating symptoms (sudden crash and
wispy) must have been a result of power failure, like maybe the
rectifier's semiconductor material stopped semiconducting at too high a
temp.  Is an overheating power supply still a feasible issue today?

Okay - a couple of suggestions:

1) Only use the white thermal grease - NOT the silver stuff EVER.
2) Don't use too much.  Just a large drop is often enough.  The heat 
sink should be doing its job, not mostly the grease.
3) If it runs fine with the case side off, your problem is definitely 
100% airflow.
4) If you've got room for an additional case fan (or two) - use them.  
They're the inexpensive part of a system and as it gets older, you'll 
need better airflow.
5) Check cabling to see if you can minimize size - cables in the way of 
airflow will SERIOIUSLY overheat a small case.  Optional - switch to a 
mid or full tower with quad fans instead of a mini case.
6) Heat rises.  Make sure that the fans are the following:
    a) Front fan at BOTTOM - sucks in
    b) Back fan towards TOP - blows out
    c) POWER SUPPLY fan blows OUT.
    e) If there are two fans in the power supply, front or bottom fan 
sucks in, back fan blows out
7) If you've got a side-mount case fan (on the case side) - make sure 
it's working properly as well.  Lower half mounted - sucks in - upper 
half - blows out
8) Remove all the grease from proc & heat sink, start over with a large 
drop of grease (not a small blob)
9) If you have an aluminium only heat sink, switch to copper.  They're 
cheap compared to a full system.
10) Set the fans to run full speed

By the way, I have a 17" widescreen notebook with a 3 gigahertz desktop 
processor installed.  I have active cooling - a full-size 120 mm case 
fan installed directly below that blows air up into the chassis under 
the air intake - system blows HOT air out the back.  I lowered the 
temperature on my notebook (desktop replacement) by about 15C.  Purrs 
like a kitten.  It's got 3 onboard fans NORMALLY (case, video, proc) and 
still runs hot (they all do) without the active cooling.

Hope any of these are useful for you.

Is it properly aligned?  IIRC, those sometimes go on only one way and 
leave a gap if you get them 180'd on accident.

As for airflow, the "case cover off" story makes me suspect 
short-circuiting.  Do you have an antec or similarly-incompetent case 
by any chance?  There should be no holes without a fan attached to 
them.  If there are, try packing tape.  Remember, you cannot make 
coolth, only remove warmth.

Thank you to all who offered ideas about what could be causing the Anti 
Burn Regulator alarm to sound on my mother board. It appears that the 
problem was the grease. When I removed the heat sink there was no grease 
on the chip, and there was an empty rectangle about the size of the chip 
surrounded by grease on the underside of the heat sink. There was also 
grease all around the chip on its carrier board.

I wiped off the heat sink and the excess around the chip on its board. I 
applied a modest amount of grease to the chip and re-installed the heat 
sink. Then, confident that I had solved the problem, I reinstalled the 
side of the case. The machine has been powered up for about 20 minutes 
and hasn't complained. Of course, the machine isn't doing much right 
now, but that's for the next thread.

Thanks again for all the help.

Looks like I spoke too soon. It lasted longer than yesterday, after 
putting the new application of grease between the chip and the heat 
sink, but eventually the alarm went off.

There is a BIOS page with voltage select for CPU, DDR, and AGP. All 
three are set to Default.

Actual voltages are listed on the same BIOS page that list CPU 
temperatures. There are six voltages listed:
                         Actual
Vcore               1.64V
+3.3V               3.23V
+   5V               4.83V
+  12V             12.22V
DDR Voltage      2.48V
AGP Voltage      1.48V

A chart for the Athlon XP series shows 1.65V for Vcore, but I didn't 
find anything else about voltage.

I didn't find anything other than FOC (Fan-Off Control), which may be 
Enabled or Disabled. The 'Item Help' says, "If enabled, this function 
protect user's CPU from overheating in an event there's a problem with 
the CPUFAN. The user should also plug the CPUFAN power on the CPUFAN1 
pin. If not, system will auto shutdown." I have FOC Enabled and the fan 
connected to CPUFAN1. CPUFAN2 does not connect the sensor line to the 
fan. I think that means it can't tell how fast the fan is running, and 
just runs full speed. I can try that, but the fan RPM only varies 
between 2721 and  2766 RPM (with the case side off).

I'll be trying to boot Knoppix shortly. If I can find a way to read the 
CPU Temp quickly before shutting down (is that something /proc keeps?), 
I'll try to check it. Right now it's running at 46 deg C/ 114 deg F.

Does anyone know how to send printer codes to a printer?

In DOS I use "LPRINT CHR$(12)" to send a form feed to the printer and it will 
eject a page. 

Everything I have shows how to send ASCII codes to standard output, the 
screen ,  from the shell.  I want to change fonts in my printer so I need to 
be able to send the code first, then I can send the file.

Otherwise I will have to set up the printer from the front panel.

   How about redirection? Echo what you want to the screen, but add '> lpr'
(without the quotes) to redirect the output. You can also use the pipe
command '|' to send the display to lpr.

I tried a little experiment:

root at ns:/dev# echo "I rule" >/dev/lp0 
The printer sprang to life and did stuff, though it sadly did not print
anything.  But this was an overly simplistic test.  Redirecting the
output to the parallel port is probably the equivalent of the DOS (or
old-scool BASIC) LPRINT command.  If I had an old dot-matrix printer, I
might have actually seen some output, who knows?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0609241524340.3745@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Cue the theme from "The Twilight Zone." Today my Sony Vaio started acting
up. I ran the command 'rm -f g*' from within ~/, and was told that the
command rm could not be found. I also could not run any shell command,
including 'su,' from either a virtual console or the console. Logging in as
root from a different console fixed the problem. Then it happened again,
after I installed an application and tried to run it.

   What might cause this behavior?

Fixed the problem as then your normal user could run commands, or then
root could run commands?

Run as who? (root or normal user?)

Screwing with your $PATH will do that.  Are you sure you didn't run
'rm -f g *'? (note the space before the *) That would toast your .
files, which would almost certainly have some effect on your PATH, but
no one elses. (it also wouldn't take effect until you opened a new
terminal, vt, or logged out / in.

Are you missing any files in your home dir?

   Between GTK+2-2.6.10 and -2.8.12 the LC_TIME defaults were changed so that
the start of the week is Monday rather than Sunday. Of course, no gtk+2 app
allows the user to select the preferred day. The current settings for
LC_TIME are displayed by 'locale -k LC_TIME.'

   A Google search found a fellow in Great Britain running gentoo who found
some tools to change LC_TIME on his machines to begin the week on Monday.
This is apparently neither a well-documented procedure nor without risk.

   Has anyone here changed LC_TIME definitions? If so, please pass on the
procedure.

Rogan,

   When a normal user could not run commands, root could. From the same
directory and the same commands.

   Normal user.

   Nope. To both. Nothing changed in $PATH and the files g* were still there;
root could delete them with the same command.

   But, it would have remained a problem after rebooting.

   Nope.

root's $PATH is different from that of a normal user.  Don't know which
distro you are using, or I would be able to tell you where each $PATH is
defined.

Does the full path, /usr/bin/rm, work for a normal user?  If so, then
the $PATH is broken.  echo $PATH to check it.  If it looks right, that's
when things get weird.

Check aliases to make sure an rm-overriding alias didn't get created.

When you mentioned gentoo, I went for my tried-and-true approach to
finding any and all documentation.  I went to google and typed in
"gentoo wiki LC_TIME".  Bingo!

I'm not about to try this, so I cannot tell you if it works.

Oddly enough...
I remembered that the Evolution email client had a setting to change the 
starting day of the week.  My starting day of the week is set to Monday 
from when I was back in Australia.

Running locale -k LC_TIME reports that my starting day of the week 
should be Sunday.  Running 'cal' confirms this.

Clicking on the GNOME clock to bring up the calendar widget, which is 
*supposedly* tied into Evolution for calendar events, shows my week 
starting on Saturday.

What I've gained from this observation is that LC_TIME locale settings 
might not be tied into either GTK/GNOME or visa versa, nor is 
Evolution's week start option tied into anything else.  Anyone else shed 
some additional light into this (especially how my week start in GNOME's 
calendar widget got to be Saturday)?

Cheers,

Carlos,

   I fail to understand how running a command can alter the path.

   Don'k know. Rebooting puts things right again, and a changed $PATH would
not be fixed by rebooting.

   It was every shell command ('ls,', 'cd,', 'su,' etc.) that refused to
work; "command not found." I've not before encountered this regardless of
distribution or hardware.

   The one I found is here:
         <http://www.linux.com/howtos/Indic-Fonts-HOWTO/locale.shtml>

This was the first of 8,360,000 hits for 'linux locale.'

   I'm not about to, either, because I am not running gentoo.

   The problem is with GTK+2 and the challenge is to find a fix that works
with Slackware.

(assuming Bash or something compatible) If that above command was run, 
either by you directly or a script you might've run at some point, that 
could've done it.  Try the above command and see for yourself what the 
effects are.  You should be able to return to normal by logging out and 
back in again.

It sounds like you ran a script that took over and modified your user's 
path variable, even just for that on session.  the PATH variable isn't 
something that is permanent, but something that is set through a script 
each time you log in.

Daniel,

   The fellow in the UK uses Gnome and Evolution, too.

   That's exactly what he found.

   The problem is GTK+2 related, and was created somewhere between 2.6.10 and
2.8.12. Others experienced the same problem, but I don't recall the
distributions they used. The issue affects all GTK+2 applications. I got
caught when I had to upgrade the library as part of installing freerock
gnome just so I can run gnucash. I stumble on dates because jpilot was where
I first experienced the difference and I refer to its calendar frequently
during the day.

   I've written to the gsb-freerock mail list (that's the Gnome Slackware
Build), and a fellow in Italy wrote that he'd look into the problem. From
what I read on that mail list, the GTK+2-2.10.x series is broken even worse.

   So, mate, if ya' got some ideas of how to manipulate -- safely -- the
LC_Time component of locale, please pass them on.

Thanks,

Rich

I've done a bit of testing and I've figured out what the GTK/GNOME 
settings are tied to.  It's specifically tied to root's locale settings 
(root's the LANG and LC_TIME variables).  This is because the X server 
is initially started as root, even if "startx" is run by the user. 
GNOME has no way of getting a user's individual locale settings because 
they're almost always set by a shell login script (ie. ~/.bashrc). 
There is no set standard location to keep this information that GNOME 
can rely on.

With that said, merely adding a line or two in the /root/.bashrc or 
another similar shell initialization script won't do the trick.  This is 
because X doesn't get started after logging in as root, it's usually 
done at the system level and doesn't pick up those variables.

The way to fix the problem is simply to define the LANG and/or LC_TIME 
variables in a system startup script that is high up in the execution 
chain, preferably somewhere like the rc.sysinit file(? - there may be 
better places to put the LANG info):
LANG="en_US.UTF-8"

What day of the week has the GNOME calendar been starting for you?  If 
it's been starting on a Saturday, then it's because the default locale 
was set to "" or "C", which picks up the "POSIX" LC_TIME info that says 
to start on a Saturday.  I was having the problem of starting on a 
Saturday because I set my system-wide LANG to "C" so that commands like 
'ls' wouldn't do stuff like mix upper, lowercase and ".*" files 
together.  This is what messed things up for me.  I found out that I 
could use a normal locale and still get sorting working properly by 
setting the LC_COLLATE variable to "POSIX" after setting the locale to 
what I wanted:
export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
export LC_COLLATE="POSIX"

   Monday. I see it in gnucash, xfce, jpilot, and wxPython apps.

   Here're the results of running locale:

LANG=en_US
LC_CTYPE="en_US"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US"
LC_TIME="en_US"
LC_COLLATE=C
LC_MONETARY="en_US"
LC_MESSAGES="en_US"
LC_PAPER="en_US"
LC_NAME="en_US"
LC_ADDRESS="en_US"
LC_TELEPHONE="en_US"
LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US"
LC_ALL=

   Only the collation sequence is set for C to avoid the intermixing of
cases.

   And here're the results of 'locale -k LC_TIME':

abday="Sun;Mon;Tue;Wed;Thu;Fri;Sat"
day="Sunday;Monday;Tuesday;Wednesday;Thursday;Friday;Saturday"
abmon="Jan;Feb;Mar;Apr;May;Jun;Jul;Aug;Sep;Oct;Nov;Dec"

first_weekday=1
first_workday=1
cal_direction=1
timezone=""
date_fmt="%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y"
time-codeset="ISO-8859-1"

   If I change the week-1stday -- somehow -- to 19971130 then the week will
start on Sunday. Also, I could change the first_workday to =2 and that would
fix the proble, too. But, I don't know how and the little I've read of
localdef warns me away from rash actions.

Many thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] grub and fdisk problems mean what?
Message-ID: <20060925055427.A34273@eehouse.org>

I have a 3.5-year-old IBM desktop system with a 40G hard drive running
Debian testing.  I just downloaded the patches for kernel 2.6.18, built
it and installed the vmlinuz file in /boot and rebooted, expecting to see
the new kernel in grub's startup menu.  (This was my first reboot since
installing 2.6.17 a month or two back.)

Instead I got "Grub loading, please wait... Error 17"

So I toss in a handy Ubuntu live CD, and when it comes up take a look
at the hard drive.  There are supposed to be three partitions on this
dual-boot system.  IIRC hda2 is fat-32 (with Win2K on it), about 10
gig, and there are a couple of 15G ext2 partitions at hda1 and hda3.
But according to fdisk I have only one partition:

ubuntu at ubuntu:~$ sudo fdisk /dev/hda
[...]
Command (m for help): p

Disk /dev/hda: 40.0 GB, 40016019456 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 4865 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1               1           1        8001    1  FAT12

If I go ahead and mount /dev/hda1 (allowing mount to determine the
fs type itself) things look ok:

ubuntu at ubuntu:~$ mount | grep hda1
/dev/hda1 on /mnt type ext2 (rw)

And the size and amount of stuff on there look about right:

ubuntu at ubuntu:/mnt$ df /mnt/
Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda1             14421344  13081608    607176  96% /mnt

But when I try to look at any of the files I get errors:

ubuntu at ubuntu:/mnt$ ls /mnt/boot
ls: /mnt/boot: Input/output error

I can't do anything to any of the files in /mnt without getting that 
same error.  

In addition, I can't mount any of the other partitions:

ubuntu at ubuntu:~$ sudo mount /dev/hda2 /mnt/
mount: special device /dev/hda2 does not exist

I don't know much about udev, which this cd is using, but I gather
that the device files being missing (and they are) could just mean
that udev didn't notice the partitions (rather than that they really
don't exist.)

Oh, and looking through the logs I found a suggestion that I run
e2fsck:

ubuntu at ubuntu:/var/log$ sudo e2fsck /dev/hda1
e2fsck 1.38 (30-Jun-2005)
The filesystem size (according to the superblock) is 3662812 blocks
The physical size of the device is 2000 blocks
Either the superblock or the partition table is likely to be corrupt!
Abort<y>?

Can anybody suggest what might be going on here, and maybe how to go
about fixing it?  Is this a situation I could have gotten into by
installing a new kernel?  Or did my superblock get trashed sometime
over the 40 days since I last re-booted?

Thanks,

--Eric

This problem that you describe appears to have been widely reported as a 
bug in GNU C library's locale.
http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2371

I'm not sure what version of the glibc library you're running, but 
you're probably stuck with one of the versions that has the bug.  The 
version I'm using, 2.4.11 doesn't seem to be affected by this problem 
and my week-1stday entry appears as 19971130...so the problem has been 
fixed at some point.

I only see the following options for you:
1. upgrade glibc (ugly and probably not worth it!)

2. change to a different locale for the LC_TIME variable, such as 
en_US.UTF-8 and see if that provides a different value for week-1stday. 
  The following code automates testing every single locale on the system 
that matches your desired LC_TIME settings:
#!/bin/bash
# finds other locales that match the desired LC_TIME settings
export LC_TIME="en_US"
locale -k LC_TIME | sed s/19971201/19971130/ > locale.old
for i in `locale -a`; do
    export LC_TIME="$i"
    locale -k LC_TIME > locale.new
    (diff --brief locale.old locale.new > /dev/null) \
      && echo "match found...$i"
done

3. use localedef.  I wrote a bash script specifically to do this for 
you!  Well, for anyone else who comes across the bug in the future and 
for myself.  I wanted to be able to change the starting day of the week 
for the en_AU locale to be on a Monday (which for some reason it isn't). 
  I can imagine that several months in the future when I 
reinstall/upgrade my distro that I'll forget to copy over the new 
locales (or they won't work), and I'll have forgotten how to fix things 
again.  I've tested the script on my system and it seemed to work. 
There is nothing destructive and it can be run as non-root.  The 
defaults on the configuration variables are already set for your bug; 
just run the script and follow the "further instructions".  Have a look 
here:

It actually looks like you've hosed (overwritten) your partition table 
somehow.  You said there should be 3 partitions.  There is only one 
partition listed and that maxed out at 8 gigabytes.

If I had to guess about what caused the problem, it might be that you 
(or a script) accidentally selected or typed /dev/hda instead of 
/dev/sda1 when repartitioning/reformatting an external USB drive of some 
description.  Either that or you managed to overwrite your /dev/hda 
partition table with one from an 8 gig external drive.  I highly doubt 
you would've manually repartitioned the hard disk and chose the 
partition layout it's set at.  The final possibility is that part of 
your hard disk just corrupted itself, but if that was the case then 
fdisk would most likely report back that the partition table was corrupt 
and ask you to reinitialize it.


> ubuntu at ubuntu:~$ mount | grep hda1
> /dev/hda1 on /mnt type ext2 (rw)

If /dev/hda1 mounted then it was probably a Linux filesystem.  Your 
partition table above should've read "Linux" under the System column if so.


> And the size and amount of stuff on there look about right:
> But when I try to look at any of the files I get errors:

This is because your partition's start and end blocks are wrong.  Your 
partition was large enough that it was able to read enough of the inodes 
to display the filesystem but probably not enough for the rest of your 
files...not completely sure about how the ext2 filesystem works under 
these circumstances, but you're possibly in big trouble if you write 
anything back to the hard disk (especially the partition was mounted 
read-write above).  If you mount the partition in the future, please 
consider using mount's '-o ro' argument.


> ubuntu at ubuntu:/mnt$ ls /mnt/boot
> ls: /mnt/boot: Input/output error

This probably occurred because the inodes that Linux was looking for 
couldn't be found because they were outside of the partition's geomentry 
(start and end blocks).


> In addition, I can't mount any of the other partitions:

You can't mount any of the other partitions because Linux doesn't know 
where to find the start and end of each partition since they're not 
listed in your partition table (above).

It's not a problem with udev unfortunately.

I'd be extremely careful and NOT run e2fsck at this point.

There are some tools you can get that will search your hard disk for 
partition boundaries and try to rebuild any partition tables you might 
have.  Have a look at the following program:
http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk

The TestDisk software is included on Knoppix and a few other live CDs. 
I'm not sure about Ubuntu's live CD though:
http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Livecd

If the above doesn't work and if you can find a way to get into your 
/dev/hda1's /boot/grub/ directory (which you've already demonstrated 
above that you probably can't), there is a file called 'stage1'.  That 
should be a copy of your MBR/primary partition table.  If you can 
somehow manage to read that file, you should be able to execute 
something similar to:
dd bs=1 count=512 if=/mnt/boot/grub/stage1 of=/dev/hda

Provided the stage1 file is up to date, you *might* have some luck.  It 
probably won't kill things any more than they are.

Interesting problem. Judging from what you are seeing and have told us I 
hope your backups are in order. *Just in case*

The superblock probably got corrupted, but have faith all is not lost. *yet*

To see how to fix this we need to take the view that your hard drive is 
like a library. Each spot on your hard drive is like a book on the shelf 
in this library.  Fortunately for the library it has several areas; 
unfortunately, they are cryptically named hda1, hda2, and hda3. Down at 
the front reference desk, the superblock, there is a reference area 
telling you which area to look in.

In your case someone erased or altered your reference area!! The books 
are still there, and so are the areas. So we need to change it back to 
what it was!!

You mentioned in your e-mail that there were supposed to be three 
partitions on your system.
  hda1 is 15 Gig (ext2)
  hda2 is 10 Gig (fat-32)
  hda3 is 15 Gig (ext2)

So in order to fix your reference area, I would boot with a live CD. 
This will enable you to alter your boot record without having the hard 
drive being the primary boot device.

Then I would bring up fdisk and delete hda1. After that I would create a 
new partition hda1 of 15 gigs, hda2 at 10 gigs, and hda3 at 15 gigs. 
Then I would change the types on those three partitions to match their 
respective formats. Remember to set the boot flag and write it to disk. 
Then quit out of fdisk.

Because you didn't boot with the hard drive you can go directly to 
mounting the hard drive without a reboot. :) At this point I would go 
through and mount hda1 and run a e2fsck on it.

* WARNING * WARNING *
Only run it to scan the partition, not to fix the partition. Once it 
gets the ability to write to the partition, it has the potential to ruin 
other data if the partition information was not correct.

If everything you said about the hard drive allocation was correct, it 
should come back like a champ. :) Of course once it is recovered and 
you're assured that all three partitions are good-to-go; then I would 
definitely make a backup of your hard drive.

Personally, I have done this method before and it worked. *thankfully*

I would be interested in hearing what the rest of PLUG has to say about 
this method.

Piet

Unfortunately Eric would have to get the block boundaries exactly the 
same as they were before.  If they're off by one, it could lead to 
corruption.  For someone who originally created the partitions using 
fdisk and is very sure that they just went '+15G' or similar, it would 
be feasible to use your approach.  For someone who didn't manually set 
up everything by hand in fdisk, it's probably too risky.  It didn't seem 
like Eric has had an awful lot of experience with partitioning in fdisk 
so I would probably rule out this approach for him unless other methods 
fail.

I admit that since his partition table is already stuffed, your approach 
probably won't make things worse...but is probably too high of a risk to 
ever consider mounting anything as read-write mode or even trying to 
boot the system.  I could see your approach possibly allowing Eric to 
gain enough access to the rest of ext2/ext3 filesystem inodes and maybe 
then being able to get to the /boot/grub/stage1 file to get the MBR 
records from that...but again in read-only mode.

   Well, fixed for those of us here in the US, anyway. :-) The fellow in GB
who wrote the gentoo fix wanted to go from a starting day of Sunday to that
of Monday.

   Thank you. That's teriffic and exceptionally helpful for a lot of folks.
You're right that a system upgrade will overwrite the changes, so it's wise
to keep the script handy.

Message-ID: <1159102971.451681fb29e46@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Before yum for redhat users, it was just rpm and that was it.

I'm having trouble getting the kernel sources installed to Fedora Core 5
so that I can use vmware-player.  Irritatingly enough, I believe I've 
tried to use yum in the past to grab the kernel sources only to give up 
when I couldn't figure out how to build an rpm.  Now after using mondo 
to backup and restore my system, none of the yum downloaded updates let 
alone the kernel sources are showing up.  Trying to yum download kernel, 
I get a nothing to do error.  Uge!!!!

Mondo broke selinux and I had to disable it, anyone have a clue as to why?

Is yum intelligent enough to detect that what it thinks it has in the package
cache isn't really there?  Is there any alternative to downloading Fedora
Core updates?  I want to flick messing with online updates for Fedora all
together, but the distro never seems to ship ready to do a whole lot without
any updates applied.  Between download corruption and having Fedora's own idea
of what has been downloaded corrupt, yum seems like a huge headache.

A problem with the yum philosophy, I want to maintain multiple Fedora
Core 5 installations and have both the source packages and binary
packages for all applied updates maintained on a centralized server.  
Yum seems to keep track of what updating has been done directly on 
the machine it is maintaining.  This obviously will duplicate work 
and it isn't very corruption resistant.  If FC5 hosta and hostb need
to pull down the same update to a site A through gateway foo, why can't
one of them download the update to foo and then both of them share a 
copy?  Is it possible to mirror the Fedora Core 5 repository in 
it's entirety?  If I drop $50 into a Fedora Core 5 Bible, I want to 
have a local copy of all the updates etc. when Fedora Core 6 comes out.  
I've tried CentOS, it hasn't worked well for me.  Slackware seems even 
worse about falling behind and update issues.

I wish the Fedora Core Bible came in an electronic format that is viewable 
using the free commonly installed tools available in Linux.  I don't have 
a lot of bookspace where I don't want to fill what I do have with one 
Fedora Bible after another.  Fedora turns over so fast and the current
repository will disappear shortly.  The redhat download servers in 
contrast go all the down to the 1.0 release.  I know that bandwidth is 
becoming a problem.  If Redhat hadn't thrown out 90% of it's potential 
paying customer base by trying to become in name a large customers only
supporter, redhat might be able to afford more bandwidth.

How do you audit what can be done with RAW sockets on a Linux/Unix system?

How are raw sockets secured on current Linux systems.

With the Steve Gibson guy finding so many problems with Windows, why doesn't
he get a clue and move to Linux or one of the BSD's?

Does anyone else think that $90 for spinrite is exorbitent?

Is there a way under Linux to read smart information before one's hard disk
dies?  This should be a free feature for both Windows and Linux systems in
my opinion, not something you have to pay for.

Should help you with the source, it has the links for FC5, so you can just
do "rpm -i <URL of RPM> while not automated it'll atleast get some of the
things you're looking for installed.

I don't think so but you could possibly remove the package cache? I haven't
tried it but might work someone else could chime in? You might have to
update the list of repositories as perhaps the installed one's don't have
the kernel source available.

Slackware keeps update to date, what exactly doesn't it provide that you're
looking for?

Try the mirrors, U of O http://limestone.uoregon.edu/ftp/ and OSU also have
very fast connections and they're close :)

You don't need kernel sources to make vmplayer work.  You need the package 
"kernel-devel" and the patch to the vmware kernel modules.

If the cache gets screwed up run "yum clean all".  It will clean out all 
the cached items.  (Sometimes you get things that are wrong in the cache 
because of a mirror that is in the middle of syncing at the time you hit 
it.)

Yum is better than the options before it.

Then change the repositories to point to a local repository. 
/etc/yum.repos.d has the repository configs.

Then you need to create a local repository and just rsync that repository.

As for corruption, the packages are signed and checksummed.  They are not 
going to install corrupted.

There are tons of mirrors for getting Redhat packages.  Yum will pick 
whatever mirrors are available.

The advantage of yum is it will grab all the dependancies for the install 
without having to do it manually.

The Redhat bible is not needed to run Redhat or Fedora.  I think the last 
time I looked at one of those was around Redhat 4.2.

Once you understand how yum works, you can make it do what you want.  It 
is pretty flexable.

I'm impressed!  A couple of weeks ago I tweaked the formatting of the
8M CF card that my router runs on.  (LEAF on a WRAP box.)  I probably
ran the commands as root.  I was pretty stressed at the time (I'd
killed the router and so had no 'net connection for troubleshooting),
but would like to think I'm never that dumb. :-)

This looks as if it'll do the trick.  It's not on ubuntu, but it's
available statically linked so I can probably download it while
running the live CD and run it from /tmp.  I don't remember the exact
layout of my partitions -- haven't changed them since I formatted the
disk 3.5 years ago.  Testdisk will take several guesses and let me
choose, and I bet I can recognize it when I see it.

If I'm understanding correctly, I could modify the partition table to
indicate that there's an ext2 partition, hda1, beginning at the start
of the disk and running, say 15G.  Even if that's wrong, it'd give me
a much better chance of getting at that /boot/grub/stage1 file, after
which I could put the partition table back the way it should be with
no harm done to the files themselves (everything but the partition
table having been -ro all the time.)  Right?

By only allowing root to open them.  This is no different than
Windows, except that Windows users always run as Administrator.

Steve has been crying about raw sockets for years, and yet the
internet is still alive and well.  There's enough zombies out there
that anyone who wants to perform a DDoS attack can do it whether they
have raw socket access or not.  As DDoS turns into big business
(extorsion) it would not take long for rootkits to include custom raw
socket code that hooks directly into NDIS, even if Microsoft didn't
provide full raw socket capabilities.  It is rather silly to assume
that Microsoft is responsible for all the DDoS zombies because of raw
sockets.  They are responsible for all the DDoS zombies because their
code keeps getting hacked and their security model has everyone using
their OS running as Administrator.

Because he gets more fame and fortune for bashing the most widely deployed OS.

Yes, but then again I have never lost critical data due to

Oops.  Yeah, the 8 gigabytes should've been 8 megabytes.  It looks that 
the 8M CF card tweaking was what originally led to your problem.

While Linux doesn't really care all that much about the partition type 
listed in fdisk, other operating systems do.  Linux normally just tries 
to guess what a partition's type is.  Under Windows, if it was to detect 
a partition as a fat or ntfs-based partition in the partition table, it 
would probably show it as a drive letter and say that it's unformatted. 
  Ideally partition types commonly found under Linux (ext2, ext3, 
reiserfs, etc) should have its partition table entry set to 83 
("Linux").  Linux also commonly uses the type 83 ("Linux swap") to label 
swap-related partitions in the partition table.  You can get a listing 
of partition types available to choose from within fdisk by typing the 
letter 'l'.

In theory, I believe so.  In reality, I've never tried it to know if it 
helps.  I'm also not 100% sure if the 'stage1' file contains an exact 
replica of the partition tables you want.  I would assume it does since 
grub builds the stage1 file before writing it to the MBR, and thus 
partition table.  If you used grub or anything similar to play around 
with your 8MB card, then the stage1 file is probably wrong.  Otherwise 
it's worth a shot.

There are a couple of alternatives.

You might try apt, downloadable from atrpms.net. When I've usapted it in
the past, it's been faster and more reliable than yum, despite the
improvements they've made. 

Unfortunately, the maintainers behind apt for RPM distros are focusing
their energies on SmartPM, the "Smart Package Manager." I'm not up to
speed on the current state of SmartPM, but it's also available from
atrpms.net. 

For optimizing yum, there's a way to
point /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-core.repo to a local share of the Fedora
Core install files - there are separate stanzas for binary and source
RPMs. Unfortunately, a recent yum update nuked my copy, just from
memory, I think the key is to include a line such as:

baseurl=file:///path/to/share/

where /path/to/share is a shared NFS directory where I mounted the FC5
install (and source) RPMs. Naturally, you'd comment out the other
baseurl and mirrorlist directives (the FC5 mirrorlist is really screwey,
it often points me to a mirror in some distant location such as New
Zealand).

Thanks,
Mike

Apt does not deal with multiple architicture systems correctly.  (i.e. 
x86_64.)

What does apt do that yum does not?  I have found them fairly similar.

It looks cool.  It is pretty complex though.  I want to investigate it 
further.  Smart uses the info out of a yum repository, so you don't have 
to worry about maintaining multiple configurations if you maintain a 
repository.

There is a "fastest mirror" plug-in on extras.

Be careful of using yum plug-ins on extras though.  There is a lockout 
plugin that requires using touch afterwards to create the file it is 
looking for.  (Works fine after that, but is a pain the first time you hit 
it.)

Probably because mondo does not save the selinux labels.  If the
labels aren't present, then selinux won't work correctly.  The
/sbin/fixfiles script will relabel the whole file system. This will be
done on boot if the /.relabel file exist.

Yum will detect corrupt and partially downloaded packages in the cache
and fetch them again.  The packages are checksummed in the metadata
and also signed.  Yum complain about files downloaded with the wrong
checksum.  And rpm won't install corrupted RPMs.

Currently, you have three options:

1. Rsync local mirror of repository.  Then have every machine use the
local mirror.  I do this for the updates repository because it is
useful for installing packages.  And I can run it in the middle of the
night and have fast updates.

2. Proxy cache. For repositories which I don't want a complete mirror,
like development or extras, I have setup Apache to proxy requests to
the master server and cache the results.

3. Copy the files from the yum cache to a central location or to the
other machines.  New versions of yum will delete the files from the
cache when the operation is finished; there is a config option to turn
this off.

smartmontools.

Yes, it does all of this, for free, and even tells you that your disk may be on 
its way to refubishment or grave.

There have been some recent improvements.  The newer versions at
http://apt-rpm.org/ support multilib.  They also support the metadata
format used by yum.

Apt is smarter about not installing broken packages.  Yum will abort
the whole update if there is a conflict instead of installing the
packages which can be installed.  Apt used to be faster but recent
versions of rpm have improved the performance.  On the other hand, I
find the yum interface much easier and more complete. And the python
library is getting used in the installer and various graphical tools.

FYI, if you are using SATA disks, you need to be running relatively
recent versions of the kernel(2.6.15) and smartmontools(5.36) in order
to get smart support.

No need to take that shot.  The problem is fixed.  testdisk worked
beautifully.  I booted off the live cd, downloaded it to /tmp, and
ran.  It first found what looked like the right partitions, but had
the last two marked as "delete" and said they were corrupt when I
tried to change that.  But it also mentioned that the number of heads
per cylinder was set to 16 and recommended 255.  When I made that
change it then found all four partitions, said they were fine, and let
me write the new table out.  On reboot fsck was run, but didn't report
finding any errors.  And now life is good again.

I did run grub from this machine against the CF card on /dev/sda.  Does
that mean I should now reinstall grub on this machine just to make sure
the stage1 file is what I want?

Live CDs rock, but this group rocks more!  Daniel, I owe you a beer
if you're ever in Corvallis.

Thanks,

--Eric

That's very good to hear.  Most people usually make the mistake of doing 
something like running fdisk and repairing errors only to get into much 
deeper trouble.

That looks to be your problem then.  The stage1 file might not have 
helped as there is the possibility it contained the wrong partition 
table still.  You can run 'grub-install /dev/hda' if you want to, but I 
don't think the /boot/grub/stage1 file is actually used except 
immediately after it is created.  It's usually a good idea to make a 
backup of your MBR/partition table and store it on another disk 
somewhere.  It's very small, 512 bytes and is easy to create:
dd if=/dev/hda of=hda.mbr bs=512 count=1

If this problem ever happens again, it'd just be a simple:
dd if=hda.mbr of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1

...to restore everything.  Some distros recommend creating a bootable 
floppy disk where they write to the start of a floppy and if things die 
again, just put the floppy in and it boots as normal.  This is not as 
common anymore with the decline of floppy drives.

This has been suggested to the yum maintainer and he refuses to do it. 
Pisses me off too.  (I tend to install from the devel tree and someone 
seems to forget something.)

Yum also has a problem when you update partial (By saying something like 
"yum update gnome*") of not getting all the required li=braries on 
multi-architecture systems.  (It pulls in the library for x86_64, but not 
the i386 library. That causes it to fail.)

The last time I used apt through synaptic, it was dog slow.  Might have 
just been synaptic though.

Yumex has been getting better.  I like it better than puppy.  It still has 
a few weirdnesses in the interface, but it is nice for installing 
packages.

I will have to see if apt has been updated in Fedora.

Subject: [PLUG] large email list 100K - 1 million
Message-ID: <451839BF.6010300@emediatedesigns.com>

Hello all,

I was recently asked to give an opinion about what email list would 
handle large mailings.  They were purposing 100K to 1 Million people on 
the list.  It would be an announcement list.  I have used Mailman with 
great results but only into the small thousands.  I've searched around 
but have yet to find anything that compares different mailing list like 
Mailman/PHPList/Majordomo or any other mailing list. 

So,  is there anyone on the list who could point me towards a comparison 
or give their opinions on which one would be a good mailing list to 
handle this capacity? 

Thanks,

Josh

No experience, but I would start by looking at what google and yahoo
are using.  They
have that level (number) of users.

Are you sure these guys are not spammers?

I have used majordomo with lists of about 20,000+. I have never seen a 
legitimate list that big.

The problem is not the listserv software, the problem is having the 
bandwidth and running out of system resources.  (I hacked a custom kernel 
back when I ran perl5porters to handle high volume, but that was back in 
the days when you needed to. The system used to run out of filehandles 
back in the 1.2.x kernels.)

 From what I've heard, qmail's ezmlm is supposed to be very fast for 
this type of thing.  It has a lot of memory and parallelization 
optimizations and was designed for speed and simplicity.
http://cr.yp.to/ezmlm.html

There are ezmlm clones for other MTAs, but I know if they are nearly as 
good in terms of optimizations.

for anything of this size, and assuming that your list will most likely be 
1-way directed traffic only, I would not use a ML manager at all but setup a 
webfrontend for subscribing/unsubscribing connected to something like mysql, 
and just run a script to post announcements.

I doubt that you want to archive all the returning traffic :)

 Does anyone know if there exists anything other than curl to do this?
 Curl works great, but this needs to run on an older RedHat 7.3
install where curl is not up to date.  I was hoping links/lynx/w3m
would be scriptable in this way, but so far I have not figured out
how.  I suppose I could write a perl script, but this seems
complicated with all the requirements.  Any thoughts?

I was going to suggest that you could use wget, but I believe that 
around in the RedHat 7.3 days, wget didn't properly support SSL.  Can 
you verify this by trying to download a page over HTTPS?  If wget 
supports SSL, see if it has the following options:
   --load-cookies
   --save-cookies
   --post-data or --post-file

If your wget configuration has those options, you should be able to do 
what you want with that...otherwise I'd probably say to use perl.

I recently ran across a script to do something like that using
netcat.

As someone who's rewriting a bunch of scripts that used curl and
wrappers around ftp/sftp, I'll tell you that doing it in a scripting
language will be much simpler in the end--7.3 should have LWP (although
you might have to hunt to find a Crypt::SSLeay module to implement
HTTPS).

Hm, I actually seem to have (old and obviously unmaintained) RPMs of
perl-libwww-perl and perl-IO-Socket-SSL (which I think LWP can use in
addition to Crypt::SSLeay): http://ftp.nakedape.cc/nakedape/rh73/rpm/

Lists of that size are not uncommon in certain areas, I've seen them in 
the 0.1M to 1M size in popular band info signups, popular consumer 
product info signups, things like that.

I suspect that Google has a custom application, but I'm pretty sure
Yahoo uses IronPort boxes. They are optimized for sending email, and can
pump out 1M per hour. I interviewed there a long time ago; everything
was written in stackless Python on FreeBSD. 

Is there a time limit for getting these emails out? If you can take a
day, any mailing package will work, assuming you have sufficient
bandwidth. If you need to go faster, that may take some work.

The yumex maintainer wrote a plugin that excludes broken packages to

yum-utils.

I haven't seen that.  I have run into the opposite problem of it
installing both arcitectures when just the package name was specified.
 There was some talk about changing the multilib behavior but I don't
know if a decision was made.

Yeah, it's the correct URL.  I'm not really sure what is going on for 
you.  I'm pretty sure my DNS settings are correct because I've accessed 
the website from the Internet before and I've just double-checked with 
some online DNS lookup websites and they report back the correct 
information.  Try to ping projects.digitree.org and see if it can do a 
name resolution.  projects.digitree.org has been in my DNS records for 
at least a month.

For a temporary fix, try to add the following entry to your /etc/hosts 
file if the DNS resolution fails.  That should at least get you to the 
website to download the script:
63.105.26.158    projects.digitree.org

Let me know what you find out.

Cheers,

Yeah, can you imagine a *discussion* list with 1 million subscribers?

Q. How do I $X ?

472,000 answers: you take $Y and put it into the $Z!
212,000 answers: remove $P before taking $Y and inserting into $W
108,000 followups to those answers: No silly, it's $Z now, not $W

That'd be pretty insane. :)

See WWW::Mechanize, essentially a "scriptable browser" that supports cookies

I don't think it matters much as long as they arrive within a day or 2.  
I'll have to research some of the items people suggested.

I still get the alarm with the case side off.

The case has a front fan, blowing in, and a back fan, blowing out.

The hard drive and CD cables are the round ones. The floppy cable is 
still the flat one, but it's tucked out of the way.

No side mount fans.

It's hard to get a single drop out of the two holes, so the drops spread 
a bit, rather than being a large drop. Perhaps I should try taping the 
old holes closed and making a single new one.

The heat sink has copper fins.

> 10) Set the fans to run full speed

The English of the mother board manual leaves a bit to be desired, but 
from what I can determine, if I want the fan to run full speed I connect 
it to the CPUFAN2 pins. However, if I do that, I don't get to see the 
fan speed. The BIOS has something called FOC (Fan-Off Control), which by 
default is enabled. The description reads:

"If enable, this function protect user's CPU from overheating in an 
event there's a problem with the CPU FAN. The user should also plug the 
CPU FAN power on the CPU FAN1 pin If not, system will auto shutdown."

I assume that means that FOC is watching the fan RPM and will shut down 
the system if the fan stops. In my case the fan never stops, nor does it 
appear to substantially change speed.

Message-ID: <4518A256.9010300@comcast.net>

To recap last week's episode:

Soyo KT600 Dragon Ultra Platinum mother board with AMD Athlon XP 2200+ 
processor and Thermaltake processor fan. After system has been powered 
on for a few minutes a beep alarm sounds: 1 second on, one second off, 
and continues until I shut it down. Watching the reported temperature, 
the most I have seen is 50 deg C. BTW, this is with the side off the case.

I did remove the CPU fan, saw no grease on the chip, cleaned up the 
grease from around it, added new grease to the chip, cleaned the grease 
off the fan, and re-installed it.

I went to the Soyo site looking for anything in the way of an 
explanation for the alarm. It's not 100% clear, but it appears that this 
is the ABR (Anti Burn Regulator) alarm. Recommendations include making 
sure the fan is running (I checked it visually, plus the BIOS reports in 
the neighborhood of 2700 RPM).

One recommendation is to clear the CMOS tables with a jumper. I did 
this, and then followed the instructions for setting a default set of 
entries from a BIOS command. When I told the BIOS editor to save and 
exit, I got a continuous beep followed by a shut down. When I powered 
back up, it acted normally -- at least as normally as I've seen it.

I proceeded to load FDISK from my old RH 7.0 install CD so I could clear 
the partition table on the hard drive. When I exited FDISK I pushed the 
reset button so I wouldn't continue installing RH 7. During the boot 
process I was unable to open the CD drive to remove the RH CD. I powered 
down, powered back up, removed the CD and replaced it with the SuSE 10.1 
network install CD. I got as far as the SuSE 10.1 splash screen when the 
ABR (I assume) alarm sounded. I let it go for a little while. This next 
part is a little fuzzy: I don't recall pushing the reset button, but the 
machine did reset. I watched the chip temperature display for a couple 
of seconds and then powered down. This was the first time I've seen the 
temperature above the upper 40's (it was 50).

This ABR alarm is set to go off at 85 deg C. If the chip is reporting 
45-50 deg, why is the alarm going off? If the chip temperature is really 
higher, why doesn't the BIOS say so?

Any recommendations on what to do next?

As an announcement list, it does not need most of the list management
stuff. 

There is a perl package called batch-mailer which can do the back end
of this. 

With a web interface to a list membership, and the back end it can 
be doing the 100,000 level. But the problem will be the mail errors
over time. and the grooming of bad mail addresses out of the list.

This isn't really in the DIY ethos of the group but I'd also consider 
some of the commercial email sending outfits out there.  For the numbers 
of addresses you have to send to their (negotiable) prices might work 
out well for you vs. installing and managing a bulk mailing setup 
yourself.  All of the halfway decent ones have things like using bounces 
to automatic clean the list and track "opens" (which should be taken 
with a grain of salt, but it might make somebody that you work with all 
excited).

I really doubt that your cpu is overheating.  If I were you, I'd consider
disabling the alarm and monitoring the cpu temperature via the typical
linux mechanisms.  Another thing you might consider is upgrading the
BIOS to the latest version.  Perhaps this issue has been fixed by a
later release.

I agree. I don't think I have an overheating problem. I've just finished 
running the SuSE 10.1 network installation. It took a little over an 
hour and a half. I have a different problem, but the machine is still 
powered up and there has been no alarm. I'll start a separate thread for 
the new problem.

Thanks for all your ideas and recommendations.

Subject: [PLUG] GRUB Error 17
Message-ID: <4518C2B8.4030203@comcast.net>

A network installation of SuSE 10.1 finished, but failed to boot from 
the hard drive. When I did this last week the error message was number 
18. This evening I ran FDISK (from my old RH 7 CD) so there was an empty 
partition table when the installation program got to it.

I wasn't sitting at the machine last week when it tried to boot after 
the install, but I assume it went about the same as this evening. After 
finishing all it's work, the installation program initiated a reboot. I 
didn't take out the CD, so that's what booted. I chose the default 
option, which is to continue booting from the hard drive. GRUB got into 
stage 1.5, but then gave me the error 17 message.

I won't have any time to work on this until tomorrow (Tuesday) evening, 
but I have found this in the GRUB manual:

17: Cannot mount selected partition
        This error is returned if the partition requested exists, but 
the filesystem type cannot be recognized by GRUB.

Last week my problem was error 18, but since I wiped the partition table 
before starting the install this evening, GRUB should have been able to 
find what it wants at the front end of the drive (60GB).

Can someone point me to the right documentation to figure out where to 
go from here?

Thanks.

Subject: [PLUG] Wanted: Firefox Configuration Guru Help
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0609260645530.10550@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   The inability of firefox installed here to print the text on most pages
needs to be resolved. Before you start telling me that the cure is to swap
distributions, reboot, or whatever, I found a Google hit that reported the
same problem on Debian last year. In that case, the single response was the
problem arises when the printing (including print preview) uses firefox's
built-in postscript generator "which is known to be buggy." Other Google
hits suggest that it's related to javascript. The graphics print without
problems (including the lines that separate sections of web pages) in
preview and printing (to file or the printer).

   I loaded about:config in a new tabbed window, but cannot find a reference
to the postscript generator when I enter the find string, "print."

   Firefox from 0.8.x through 1.0.x had no problems printing on my systems.
Now it does and I have not changed fonts or anything else on the system
(other than some user applications) between the time it printed and now. No
new fonts. No new printers -- or printing systems. It may well be that this
inability to print text displayed on pages began at the same time the sound
became garbled when viewing video clips (e.g., from reuters.com). That, too,
used to work. Now all video displays but the sound is garbled.

   I have no idea how to go about isolating the source of the problem. It's
very frustrating, particularly with those web pages that do not let me
highlight text with the cursor and copy it to a text file.

   Some of you are extremely clever at creating diagnostic strategies to find
problem causes, and I'd like your ideas and suggestions. I'm sure that many
of you are thoroughly familiar with firefox and other browsers because you
develop and maintain web sites that must accommodate the idiosyncracities of
various browsers.

TIA,

Rich

I suspect most install programs write GRUB to the MBR via the
grub-install command. That command doesn't always work.

I would check your menu.lst (the commands that you can see from the GRUB
menu) from the GRUB command line. Assuming you've done the default for
SUSE and installed on one partition, this seems appropriate (just from a
quick google of error 17) http://www.smop.co.uk/node/43 Sometimes the
selected partition is wrong. (my system has been screwed up before when
the order of partition numbers don't match the order on the physical
drive, e.g. /dev/hda1, /dev/hda3, /dev/hda2)

Assuming you can boot into SUSE via its rescue mode (from the install
CD), you should be able to get into the GRUB command line from the OS,
and reinstall into the MBR from the GRUB prompt (assuming the first HD)
with the following command:

setup (hd0).

Since you've looked at the GRUB manual (ref for others
<www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Command-line-and-menu-entry-commands.html> ) you can see what other commands you might try.

Thanks,
Mike

Have a look at the "grub and fdisk problems mean what?" thread from 
yesterday and the day before.  The problems you're describing seem 
similar, but not by the initial cause.

For some reason it sounds like your partition table keeps getting set to 
values that aren't correct, or the table is getting corrupt.  Since 
you've just re-installed a linux distro which should've written out a 
new partition table and it doesn't boot immediately afterward, I would 
suggest that it could be a problem with your hard disk geometry 
settings.  Check your BIOS settings and make sure that things are set to 
automatically detect geometry and the values look right.  I personally 
know someone who had this problem where everything went smoothly during 
the install but GRUB always failed to boot Linux.  They reinstalled the 
Linux distro about 4 times, always with the same result.  In the end, 
one look at their bios and changing the hard disk detection to auto 
fixed everything.

Also, the linux installer could be choosing bad values somehow.  How old 
is your computer you're installing on?

Cheers,

   Let me clarify "here:" it's this one machine. On the portables there is no
problem. Sigh.

I've had problems with firefox printing and debian.  One thing to try is 
to remove the prefs.js file in the firefox directory and let firefox 
recreate a new one from scratch.

This may sound stupid but have you invoked firefox from the command line so
you can see any output that shows up when you are taking particular actions
- such as printing in this case? You can also run it in debug mode with
firefox --debug

Sean,

   I just tried this and it makes no difference.

   There is _something_ different about this system that's getting in the
way. One big difference is the presence of freerock gnome, but I've had the
firefox printing issue since before installing that.

   The fonts directory on all machines are the same; I tarred them from this
main box and copied them to the portables when I set them up.

Thanks very much for the suggestion,

Rich

Is this the same problem you were having several weeks back that we were 
discussing?

Drew,

   A very insightful question. No, I had not tried that before. But, I did
just now, and saw nothing:

(gdb) run
Starting program: /usr/lib/firefox-1.5.0.7/firefox-bin 
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
[New Thread 16384 (LWP 4533)]
[New Thread 32769 (LWP 4536)]
[New Thread 16386 (LWP 4537)]
[New Thread 32771 (LWP 4539)]
[New Thread 49156 (LWP 4543)]

[Thread 16386 (LWP 4537) exited]
[Thread 49156 (LWP 4543) exited]
[Thread 32771 (LWP 4539) exited]

Program exited normally.
(gdb)

   During this period I loaded google news and viewd the print preview (only
graphics, no text). Similarly, running it from the command line without the
debug option shows nothing but the application name as I typed it.

Thanks,

Rich

Daniel,

   Yes. The criticality factor was raised when I could not print receipts for
airline reservations and car rentals.

   I've tried various search terms on Google, and following up on hits that
look promising, but nothing pans out.

Try running "strace firefox" ... you're gonna get a ton of garbage so maybe
redirect it to a file for reading later.

Also is this an official Firefox build or a distro package? If its a distro
package what distro ... I remember vaguely that you run slackware so I can
see if I can reproduce it on any of my boxen

Please put on a website, or send me privately, a example copy of the 
postscript file generated by Firefox and the exact URL that you printed 
from.  I will have a look at the postscript contents to see if the text 
is there but just hidden, or if the text truly doesn't exist.

Cheers,

Google sez check out PHPlist:

Can generate PDFs, and pull mailings from an RSS feed.
Claims to handle 100,000+ users easily.
More here: http://www.phplist.com/details

I'm sure googling for "announcement delivery" would yield more,

So, in sum: something's deeply and weirdly screwed-up with either
Firefox or system libraries that it uses, in a manner that is likely
unique to this one system.  It has at least two symptoms, either of
which makes the browser nearly useless to you.

Neither you, nor the tandem intelligence of many of Portland's brightest
Linux experts, have been able to resolve this issue, which has persisted
for quite a while now.

It has consumed many collective hours that could have been spent helping
others, earning one's daily bread, or being with loved ones.

Given all this, I will ask:
1. Have you tried completely removing Firefox, and reinstalling it by
whatever means recommended by the Slackware folks?
2. Have you tried removing Firefox and installing it from a tarball?
3. Have you considered trying e.g. Konqueror?
4. Have you brought your computer to a Linux Clinic so skilled gurus
might poke and prod at it instead of speculating at a distance?
5. Have you considered using a computer that works correctly, instead?
6. Again, may I send you an Ubuntu CD?

Good offences make good neighbors,
  Aaron

Yes, something is messed up.  I've figured out what it is.  I've been 
able to recreate Rich's problem and am now trying to narrow down exactly 
which little variable is causing the fuss.  I'll explain a little bit 
about what I found out so far:

The postscript document that Rich provided me does not contain any text 
except for a couple of headers.  The body of text is definitely not 
present in the postscript file.

I noticed 'certain difference' between Rich's postscript source and mine 
which is that his printer output is using different fonts...the big 
difference is that mine were using the Arial-based font from the 
msttcorefonts package.  After I removed the package (but without 
restarting Firefox), my postscript output I generated failed in exactly 
the same way that Rich's did.  The website Rich gave me 
(news.google.com) uses Arial in its stylesheet.

My belief is Firefox is not selecting a reasonable alternative font when 
trying to generate his postscript document.  Firefox (or the postscript 
renderer) either doesn't know a good alternative font and is saying 
"I'll just skip it", or there is a font definition that it is choosing 
that just doesn't work.

After I restarted Firefox, my printing returned to normal and I was able 
to print the page fine again (without the Arial font).  The postscript 
output decided to default to whatever was one of the default fonts in 
Firefox depending on whether it was going to use a sans font or a 
sans-serif.  If Firefox didn't explicitly select a default font but just 
left it as "sans" or "sans-serif", then it would drop back to whatever 
the user-wide defaults for those values were, as defined in GNOME and 
possibly also by the font server.  In Firefox, leaving the serif font at 
"serif" would result in it using the GNOME's "Application font". 
Leaving the sans-serif font at "sans-serif" would result in the 
postscript using "Nimbus Roman" based fonts, regardless of the GNOME 
fonts I chose in the preferences.  This must be set elsewhere, possibly 
the font server.

As for Rich, he probably has some bad settings in his font server (a 
font or two that don't resolve).  He can get around this, for Firefox at 
least, by setting his default fonts to something he knows that works, 
maybe something like Bitstream Vera.

doxygen, or even lxr (used everywhere for kernels). The linux kernel has it's

Wow!  Sounds like you were able to reproduce a subtle bug!  Wonder what
happens is Rich changes his default font setting, or sets it to override
the page's selections?

Thanks! doxygen looks like it will fit the bill; I've asked the 
developers who are looking for this tool to evaluate it.

I've continued on playing a bit more with the font issue in Firefox.  I
have some additional contributions to make that may help Rich.

I can very easily make Firefox reproduce the same postscript generation
problems that Rich has by loading Firefox:
1. Visit news.google.com.

2. Remove the msttcorefonts package (which has the Arial font the page's
CSS defaults to) or move the '/usr/share/fonts/msttcorefonts' directory
to something else.

3. Click on "print preview".  The page contains some text (page headers
and a couple other pieces), but the main body of text doesn't exist in
the postscript.  This matches exactly with what Rich's postscript looks
like.

Restarting Firefox causes Firefox to choose a different default font
that does exist though, unlike what is happening for Rich which keeps
choosing a bad font.

I mentioned that Rich could have a bad font, so I tried creating some
scenarios that would cause bad font problems to persist across Firefox
restarts.

1. I have tried moving fonts out of the '/usr/share/fonts' path, but
when Firefox starts it just defaults the postscript output to another
font.  There are still entries in the font server's path, as checked
with 'chkfontpath -l'.

2. I have tried moving/renaming fonts but keeping them within the
'/usr/share/fonts' directory.  Firefox doesn't complain and finds the
font anyway, because the font server scans for all files and gets their
name from internally within the file(?).

3. I've tried setting fonts to have their permissions set to 0600.
Trying to start Firefox, which is set to use the font, fails to start
altogether.

4. I've tried setting fonts to have their permissions set to 0600 after
Firefox has been started but before doing a print preview.  Firefox
crashes when trying to preview.

5. I've tried corrupting fonts by inserting random data randomly through 
about 2% of the file.  I made sure to leave the header definitions 
intact that define the name of the font and its capabilities).  Firefox 
was willing to start with and use the corrupt font.  It mostly just 
displayed very odd looking characters on the screen.  The print preview 
showed the same random oddities, but not "no text".  Surprisingly it 
didn't even crash like I was expecting.

Overall, I can't seem to create a font or modify any settings that would 
cause Firefox not to detect a bad/missing font when it starts up.  I've 
had a look into fc-cache/list/cat to examine whether fonts were 
disappearing from the font lists when moving or modifying them. 
Everything appeared as I expected, ie. moving fonts out of font 
directory removed them from the list, etc.

Anyone have any other suggestions as to how the font server might 
provide a bad printer font to Firefox and/or ways to fool the browser 
into thinking there's a font that doesn't exist?

Cheers,

Daniel Hedlund

Oops.  I forgot to include a couple of Firefox bug reports that may also 
be of interest to Rich if all of what I said doesn't produce a result:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=266224
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=239267

Another suggestion is that there is an option in the 'about:config' page 
of Firefox called 'font.FreeType2.enable' that is set to 'false' (at 
least on my system), but 'font.FreeType2.printing' is set to 'true'. 
There is a possibility that the problem could be within FreeType and 
that Firefox is using FreeType to print the body text.  If nothing else 
I've mentioned works, it might be worth a shot to change the 
'font.FreeType2.printing' variable to 'false' and see if that helps.

Daniel,

   I just changed from the default of Helvetica to Arial, then Bitstream Vera
Sans. No visible text in the print preview with any of them.

   Where in the fonts directories should I look for a problam?

Many thanks,

   Ta-da! That _does_ make a difference, a positive one.

   So, if I'm not asking too much, what might cause the need for this change
on one box but not on others? Could it be the freetype2 installation? It
must be somehow related to freetype2, no?

So, that fixed your problem?  That was only meant to be a while shot in 
the dark kind of guess because I didn't really know what affect it would 
have.  I almost didn't mention it.

Perhaps your FreeType2 installation is not working properly?  Maybe you 
don't have it installed.  I'm not sure what applications also use 
FreeType2, especially for printing.  If anyone else on this list knows, 
please feel free to chime in so Rich can test out those applications.

...and Rich, about your sound problems...if they haven't already been

I'm wondering if anyone has the mailbox files for the old plug mailing

somewhere.  It'd be nice to see them finally get put back up on the web. 
  It's been brought up on this list a few times, but maybe it's about 
time it finally happens.  I'd be happy to host them on my server until 
they can be put on the official website; I'm behind ADSL though so It'd 
be a bit slow...but at least available.

Wil, you're in charge of administering the website now, right?  What 
would it take for me to get enough access to put the mailbox files online?

I have a collection of old PLUG mail traffic gathered from various
historical sources.  I have had various starts/stops trying to sort it
all out and "cleanse" it of non-PLUG mail and delivery headers that
don't really belong in an archive.  The stops have outnumbered the
starts, and the truth value of the "finished" condition is sub-unity.

Message-ID: <4519F76F.3080909@comcast.net>

I burned a copy of Knoppix V 5.0.1 the other day. When I start the 
computer with it in the CD drive, I see an initial splash screen with 
the invitation to hit <ENTER> to boot from the CD. When I do so it 
proceeds for awhile, the screen goes blank, I hear a female voice saying 
something to the effect of "Initiating Startup Sequence", but nothing 
happens after that. Well, not entirely nothing. The screen develops 
retrace streaks that change their spacing over time. But other than 
that, nothing. I waited for about 3 minutes after the voice spoke.

Am I missing something?

Nothing a perl script couldn't clean up for you, breaking the mailbox 
files down into individual emails and then grepping/regexping for the 
mailing list address in the email to sort out the non-list traffic.

Besides the non-PLUG emails, how complete would the email collection you 
have be?  I guess even that doesn't matter because each email would have 
at least some unique identifier that we could use to weed out duplicates 
from multiple peoples' collections as they were merged.  This is unless 
someone has pristine complete mailbox files laying around.

Hit the <F1> key (or something like that) at the boot prompt.  It should 
give you some options you can specify.  Try changing your monitor's 
resolution and/or modes.  Perhaps try to force vesa mode.  Let us know 
if that helps.

If the kernel command line has something like "vga=791" in it, and your
video setup can't handle it, you will get a blank screen, but the bootup
will keep chugging right along.  vesa is a good call, or at least get the
vga parameter out of the command line.

All I need are the archives (preferably in mbox); if David has them, he
should upload them to his account on the server.  If you have them and
can make them available, just point me at an URL.  I can give you an
account if you need it, but for the same of simplicity I'd rather not
create more accounts than I have to.

The overheating alarm issue continues, but it appears that after a

and lets me boot the rescue system.

Here's my notes on fdisk and from the BIOS:
==========================================================================
Rescue:~ # fdisk /dev/hda

The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 7297.
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)

The parts, except the AMD chip, are all slightly used. The mother board 
has a date of 09/02/2003.

It's been awhile since I've worked with those kinds of numbers, and the 
hour is getting late (for me!). Does the geometry look right from one 
source to the other: BIOS/fdisk/Grub?

Am I getting close? Did I just edit a line in Grub the wrong way?

Thanks for all the support.

I'll try that later. I was only trying to boot the Knoppix CD when I was 
having trouble getting very far with the rescue boot from the install 
CD. Since that finally worked, this is temporarily moot. However, thanks 
for the info. I know it will be useful another day.

Back in July of 2001, Russell solicited us for old PLUG mailing list 
traffic. I still have the zip archive I sent him containing some stuff 
from early 1998 -- but I suspect that Russell probably has the best 
early archive.

Subject: [PLUG] OpenOffice.org and PostgreSQL
Message-ID: <451A82F4.7070008@acm.org>

Not sure where to ask: OpenOffice.org or a PostgreSQL list so I'll start 
here hoping for a clue.

I'm trying to access a PostgreSQL database using OpenOffice.org Base. 
I've installed the latest driver from dba.openoffice.org and tried to 
followed the rather brief instructions to use it as a data source type.

The issue is I never see PostgreSQL as a data source type nor can I find 
a way ( according to the instructions ) to define it as one.  The menu 
option 'Tools->Data Source' doesn't exist!

This is a Fedora Core 4 system with the latest updates.  Which is OOo 
2.0.x.  I can't remember 'x' and the system with the problem is at work.

Searches for HOWTOs all lead back to the Tools->Data Source thingy or 
talk about OOo 1.x.

Which list or lists do you think would be the best to ask on?


TIA,
Rod

I only have the windows oOo handy so ..

When I open 'OpenOffice.org Base' I get the database wizard.  It should
come up automatically when in OpenOffice.org (with all items closed) 
you select File/New/Database.

in the 'What do you want to do' select 'Connect to an existing database'
radioBtn
then select the connection (ODBC, JDBC etc).  Select next, then you
should get the 'Set up a connection to ODBC database' page.  Browse
button will display all defined connections.

this should work the same in either environment.

Rod,

   Ask on the OO.o list.

   I've got 2.0.3 installed here. When I open a new database document I do
not find PostgreSQL as a data source option! It's defaulting to Java,
because that's another Sun product and welded into OO.o.

   Years ago I had difficulties setting up a spreadsheet as a database for
mail merge documents. The folks on the OO.o users list were extremely
helpful in explaining what the docs left out.

Good luck!

Rich

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice.  Etc, etc.

Not all mboxes are created equal.  Appropriate behaviour with regard
to splitting varies.  Mailing list software has varied over the
years.  In short, much craziness is present.

The degree of completeness varies as you go backwards in time.  I have
the old skylab archive that goes back to July 98 fairly completely.
And pretty much everything since (with some small holes, probably).  I
have less completeness prior to July 98.

There is a new-ish driver that I'm trying to use.

	http://dba.openoffice.org/drivers/postgresql/index.html

I'll re-trying the process and getting some _unusual_ errors.

	unopkg list

shows nothing installed.

	unopkg remove postgresql-sdbc-0.7.2.zip

gives errors

	unopgk add --shared postgresql-sdbc-0.7.2.zip

gives already installed errors.

	unopkg add postgresql-sdbc-0.7.2.zip

appears to have worked.  But no postgresql in the drop-down.

Now
	unopkg list

now gives me lots of interesting informatiom.


I'm off to the OpenOffice.org list.


Thanks all,
Rod

1998-2002 sounds like a good start; can you make that available to me?

I feel I must be getting closer to the solution. The machine ran all 
night in SuSE rescue mode without giving me the overheating alarm.

I logged in as root and did a bit of wandering around. In addition to 
the info from grub, fdisk, and BIOS I posted last night here's one more 
thing I found in /proc/partitions:

major minor  #blocks  name

   7     0      24664 loop0
   7     1      24664 loop1
   3     0   58615704 hda
   3     1    1598436 hda1
   3     2   20972857 hda2
   3     3   36041827 hda3

Also, when I looked at the geometry with grub it reported:
grub> geometry (hd0)
drive 0x80: C/H/S = 65535/16/63, The number of sectors = 117231408, /dev/hda
   Partition num:0,  Filesystem type unknown, partition type 0x82
   Partition num:1,  Filesystem type is reiserfs, partition type 0x83
   Partition num:2,  Filesystem type is reiserfs, partition type 0x83

The unknown filesystem type should be the swap partition, based on my 
recollection of what the SuSE installation reported before it created 
the partitions.

Does this help narrow the focus of where I should be looking?

If I'm reading right, things should work now. The setup (hd0) command
should have written GRUB to your MBR. 

Unfortunately, I think I led you wrong with the Website reference. That
person configured /boot on a separate partition - but never explicitly
said so. He only implies it from the relative partition locations of /
and vmlinuz. 

If I'm understanding you right, you have - not - configured /boot on a
separate partition. (The Red Hat/Fedora default configures /boot
separately; the SUSE default does not.)

I'm guessing if you put /boot back, per the previous entry, GRUB should
be able to find the kernel.

This is where I become unsure. I assume you've configured a different
directory (such as /home) on /dev/hda3.

Alas, whatever the hardware problem is won't go away. The system stayed 
up until just before lunch. When I tried running grub again, it hung. 
When I tried to reboot the rescue system, I got the alarm. I wish I knew 
what I did yesterday that let me start the rescue system, or what I 
earlier that let me install the OS.

Yes, /dev/hda3 is (or will be) /home.

While the machine was running I was able to mount hda2 and hda3. hda2 
has the usual collection of OS related directories. hda3 was empty and I 
was able to create a text file with cat.

I decided to give it a try. I didn't get a grub error this time. Instead 
I got:

Disk Boot Failure

Correct. This started out as a single empty 60GB drive with a partition 
table wiped clean using fdisk from my RH 7 install CD.

Hi all,

I have Ubuntu 6.06 on my laptop.  I think I want to get a comcast
cable connection.  I have never had internet cable before.  I had
cable TV ten plus years ago.  I think there is still some cable wire
coming into my house.  I'm not sure.  I cannot get DSL where I live.
I've checked various times with the phone companies, and they say that
my part of town, S.E. Portland near Milwaukie, is not DSL capable.

Anyways, does anyone on this list have particular knowledge about what
the best way to go about getting a comcast cable connection with
Linux.  I'm think I've seen deals where you pay 33 a month for a year
before they jack your prices up, but I'm not sure if I have to already
have Cable TV, and Cable Phone.  I don't have either, and I don't want
either.

Also, should I pay for a cable modem, or rent one, or can I get one
for free as part of some deal?

Also, do I need Windows in order to do the initial configuration of my
Cable conneciton?

Also, any links that would answer my question would be nice.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

Hi all.

I have installed Ubuntu 6.06 on my laptop.  As part of my "dead end
security gaurd" job, I sometime sit in a parking lot for eight hours
at 185th near Gresham, near Marine Drive, practically on the Columbia
river.

I am thinking of gettin a PCMCIA card that will let me surf the net
from my laptop while I while away my time on the job.  What kind of
PCMCIA card should I get?  What kind of cellular service should I get?
 T-Mobile?  Cingular?  Verizon?  Anyone have particular knowledge or
opinion regarding service, speed of internet access, and type of
PCMCIA card I should get?

Or should I have my laptop communicat via blue tooth with a cellular
phone, which I don't own, but might get, depending on the opinions I
hear?

Or is there some techie solution that I havn't considered?

Any links I should check out?

Thank you for your consideration.

You should not need Windows for anything. The cable modem will connect to
your pc via cat5 to you NIC. In network setup I added 68.87.69.146 and
68.87.85.98 as DNS servers and had1.or.comcast.net as my search domain.

Renting vs buying a cable modem? I can't say which you should do. I rent
mine. This worked well for me when my original cable modem died and Comcast
brought out a new one, same day, for free.

If that were so I wouldn't be having this fun:

"don't like" is a very mild expression of my yum attachment at the moment.

Check comcastoffers.com for cheap deals with free modems.  I have an
extra, unused modem lying around, too.  I also recently got free modem
rent and a very good monthly rate just by asking (and making it clear
that I could get DSL for $xx per month.)

In theory, yes.  I've had good luck asking the tech to use his laptop to
do the setup, ("Oops, my computer's not ready," or whatever--many of the
techs are Linux sympathizers anyway.)

Message-ID: <498756ed0609271810n5ffb93e4q780f2f1747e7bbb9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have installed Ubuntu 6.06 on my laptop.  My Kensington Exper Mouse,
which is a Trackball, connects to my laptop via a serial connection,
and works in Windows.  When I go into Ubuntu, my Track Ball doesn't
work.  Is there some "how to" on how to get my Track Ball to work.

One thing that I tried is the following:

I bought a PCMCIA card with USB 2.0 ports on it.  I connected my
TrackBall to a serial to USB converter, and then connected that ot the
PCMCIA card with the USB 2.0 ports.  The Track Ball kind of worked.
It was very herky-jerky ( to use a technical term ).

Is this the kind of thing I will learn how to do once I learn how to
go into X Windows.  I have the book Ubuntu, from Novice to
Professional, and I think that's where I will eventuall learn the
intricacies of my inquiry to you all.  But in the meantime, can I get
some pointers please?

Any links would be appreciated?

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

Ouch. I assume this is the same system discussed in the previous thread
as overheating. First thought is that the heat is affecting your hard
drive.

If it's still related to GRUB, one more troubleshooting hint for you -
from the boot menu, print out your GRUB stanza, and get into the GRUB
command line (Press Esc to go from the SUSE graphical GRUB menu to the
GRUB text menu, and then press c to get a GRUB command line). Type in
the commands one by one (command completion works here - it's also a
good way to test the way other GRUB commands affects your boot process).

Maybe something like - ide=nodma - on the kernel command line can get
around some hard drive issues, but that's a wild guess.

grub> root (hd0,1)
grub> kernel /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda2 vga=0x31a resume=/dev/hda1
splash=silent showopts
grub> initrd /boot/initrd

If you don't get any error messages

grub> boot

should start the boot process, just as if you've booted direct from the
GRUB menu.

Good luck,
Mike

   No. A trackball looks like an upside down mouse to the port. Make sure
that you have gpm running ('ps ax | grep gpm'). You can read more about it
in 'man gpm.' In X, you'll be able to set up the trackball when you
configure all devices.

Once, after a lengthy bout with a string of techs, a tech told me I
could be on ANY windows box, anywhere; it did not have to be connected
to the modem in any way.  You could call them from elsewhere to do your
setup.

The setup process involves setting your browser proxy settings to get
onto their setup network.  I'm willing to bet they could do it in
Mozilla/Linux, but choose not to.

Given that you're getting this alarm, *and* hard disk problems, could
this be a temperature sensor on your hard drive? (smartctl will allow you
to read it)

  Cingular (ex-AT&T) has a GPRS network in town.  I suspect T-Mobil
GPRS is also available.  I've done a lot of work with Verizon's CDMA
network.  They have pretty good coverage.  The cheapest route would be
to build or buy a can-tenna and sniff around for an open WiFi AP.

  The Sierra Wireless support site has extensive documentation on
running their CDMA PC cards on Linux.  It looks pretty easy.  The PC
card is set up like a serial port.  Then you dial up a PPP link to the
Verizon network.

  The AirCard 555's are old and slow, but they're cheap on eBay.  I'm
not a big fan of Sierra's recent products, but the AC555 is OK.  Don't
forget to pick up an external antenna for the AC555!

  We've been using the Kyocera KPC650 PC cards for wireless broadband
access (CDMA 1xEVDO).  The 650's seem to have the best RX signal
strength and good stability.

  I managed to get a 2nd level tech to give me the direct URL to the
Comcast registration page a couple years ago.  The only reason it
"needed" Windows was because of IE extensions used to load spyware
from the installation CD.  The actual registration page was plain'ol
HTML.  There was a redirect page with some Javascript in the middle of
the registration that hid the final URL.

  I declined to install their spyware.  They finally gave me the URL
after I pitched enough of a fit.  I eventually had to edit the
registry to clean out their spyware install tool.

About Ubuntu and ComCast. I recently got a Comcast connection and unfortunately the tech (without my knowledge because I wasn't watching closely enough) did put some sw on my Windows box. I have edited the registry and  issued a command "rundll32.exei edkcs32.dll,Clear" that got rid of the comcast logo in the corner of IE and removed the "presented by Comcast" message in IE's banner.

If anyone would like to share what you did to get rid of Comcast spyware, I would appreciate the information. I can detail what I did which is just that command above and one registry entry that I can't remember right now but can look up.

Thanks.

1. If you have Comcast cable TV already, internet is an add-on. While
you're at it, you might want to look at their monthly packages, which
include moving your land telephone, TV, internet, etc.

2. There are two bandwidth options -- at least there were a year ago. I
have the high-end option and typically get 8 Mbits down and 768 Kbits up
peak.

3. If you just get internet and don't get the basic cable TV, it's
actually more expensive.

4. When I got Comcast, they provided the modem. If there's a discount
for not getting it, you might be able to save some money. I didn't
bother -- it took me a year for them to figure out how to get cable into
my house.

5. To check out the initial installation, I needed Windows. They may
have changed since then, but if you don't have a Windows box handy, you
might need to borrow a laptop from a friend just long enough to sign in
and register.

6. Once it's installed, you'll need to have DHCP properly configured on
at least one box, and if you have a home network, you'll need some kind
of router. I use one of my Gentoo boxes for that, following the
directions in

http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/home-router-howto.xml

7. If you run into problems, their tech support people do have a few
Linux-aware geeks. Last weekend, my router decided to interchange which
NICs went with eth0 and eth1. :( The Comcast tech understood things like
"dhcpcd" error messages. :)

In all, I'm happy with Comcast internet -- you can't argue with being
able to get a CentOS 4.4 DVD at 8 Mbits/second using Bittorrent. In the
two years I've had it, there were only a couple of problems, and those
were with their DNS server.

A few days ago I went to the Soyo web site and filled out a help

My comments to them:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ProblemDescription: After the system has been powered up for a few
minutes I get a series of beeps, about 1 second on, one second off. I
thought this was the ABR alarm, but the CPU temperature is only 47 deg
C. The speed of CPUFAN1 is varying between 2766 RPM and 2812 RPM.

Their response:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CPU fan speed should be between 3500-6500 RPM's 


Thank you for your understanding and patronage!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I recall seeing a photo of the motherboard with a much smaller fan on it. I wonder if the speed my fan is turning is moving the same volume of air as the smaller fan at the higher speed. (This is one area I've actually had some experience - fans - although it was with fans that ventilate buildings, not chips! I understand that a smaller fan at a higher velocity can move the same amount of air as a larger fan at a lower velocity.) Anyway, since the reported temperature of the chip is well within the save operating range, I've followed your advice and turned off the variable speed feature thus:

The first thing I did this morning was to power up the box, enter the BIOS, turn off FOC (Fan-Off Control). Then I powered the box down, moved the fan wires to CPUFAN2, powered the box back up and booted the SuSE install CD in rescue mode. So far, so good. 

I'll now switch back to the Grub error 17 thread.

I guess I'd better find a version number the next time I reset the box 
and compare it with what they have on their web site.

Thanks for the advice.

This seems to work on my test system, but I'd like some some confirmation from 
ye resident iptables brainiacs:

iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -j TTL --ttl-set 125

The idea is to foil idiot ISPs who don't want users sharing their Internet 
connections by setting all TTLs to the same value. Should be a felony, having 
your own LAN.

At any rate, does it look right?

Aroo?  I remember some theoretical analyses counting the number of NATed
devices using portnums and suchlike, but TTL varies anyway, dunnit?

> At any rate, does it look right?

Works for me,  all outgoing packets get the selected TTL.

Do the ISPs really care?  They have rules, but do they really care? 
There are so many problems with restricting Internet to just one 
computer.  What happens if that one physical computer is using raw 
sockets or has a virtual machine (VMware, QEMU, Virtual PC, etc) running 
and the client operating system has a different TTL?  If ISPs really 
wanted to track down how many individuals on a network, there are many 
many different ways to go about it.  Some other examples include 
checking http requests to see if multiple brower strings are present 
(ie. two versions of Internet Explorer or Firefox, epecially if on two 
different platforms).  Some http requests (at least used to) send out 
the username of the person using the computer.

Cheers,

When they can charge you $5 for each additional computer without providing 
any additional service?  Yes, they do.


They care about extracting the maximum amount of money from your wallet 
while providing the minimum amount of service.

One of the reasons I stay with SpiritOne.  They don't play any of those 
control freak games.

I use VMware for all my windows installs anymore, so after the screwed up my
wife's windows (I wasn't home when they set up the internet) I reverted it
back to the previous snapshot to remove their crap.    I still don't know
why they think they have the right to alter how our computers work because
they are providing internet connectivity.

Hey All,

I am with Verizon for my DSL account.
Two days ago my son's Windows box took a shot and his firewall shut 
everything down and all is good.  This morning, Firestarter reported 
that my Ubuntu box took a shot from 192.147.176.114.  The protocol was TCP.

Whois reports the owner as a Global Hosting something or another.

Two questions:
	1)  Can someone explain what happened here?
		Did someone try to hook up to my machine and cause havoc 		and mayhem?
	2)  The folks on the other end have an email address for abuse.  	Would 
it do any good to report the attempt to them?

Thanks!

Bruce

Can you please define "took a shot"?  To me that expression implies
the rapid consumption of nearly flammable liquids.  And if everything
goes right, there is no need for a firewall in that context (unless
you spill some in the presence of an ignition source).  I am confused.

Good question. I figured there must be more than one way to hunt down fiendish 
scofflaws. It's not something I'm familiar with, since I've always had good 
ISPs. I heard about this via a couple of different sources.

This  does confuse traceroute because it depends on being able to set ttl.

I've always explained that I'm running windows, as they require, but
that it's on a laptop that belongs to my employer and that I'm not
allowed to install anything on it.  They "get" that.

Who does that?

When I was with EarthLink (in NYC), they introduced their "home 
networking package," which was basically them charging you an extra 
$10/month to support your home network.  But it was really for support 
and hardware only ... you could still do your own set-up without having 
to pay extra.  The only irritation was that if you called in to report a 
problem, they insisted that your computer be connected directly to the 
modem -- if you were connected via a router (one they didn't supply), 
they wouldn't help.  Of course, their "help" always began, "Click on the 
Start Menu, ...".

One of those little metal clicker thingies is always handy for that sort 
of help (the kind with the spring strip attached to a dish-shaped piece 
of metal.)  Hold it right up to the phone to enhance suspension of 
disbelief.  I never did manage to come up with a convincing sound 
effect for rebooting though (hmm... maybe a ratchet, triangle, and one 
of those tubes that goes "moooooo".)

Are you sure that is  yum's fault.  It sounds like your pam libraries have
gotten deleted.

Can you  reboot in single user mode and then reinstall the pam libraries?

What did you do?  Yum breaking things is like that is pretty rare. In
fact, yum tends to have the opposite problem of not doing advanced
stuff and bailing when there are potential problems.

What does "rpm -q pam" show?  Can you install the pam RPM with rpm?
If you need to, you can use an HTTP URL with rpm (this is for FC5).

Assuming that you can login as root. One thing to try is booting into
single user mode. PAM is one of those things which when it gets hosed
can be hard to fix internally.  Otherwise, you will need to boot off
the rescue CD.

Bruce,

Someone trying to connect to a port is not necessarily evidence of
wrongdoing. That could happen for innocent reasons, like mistyping an IP
address.

Chances are, though, that it was someone scanning for a specific
vulnerability with a program that tends to run on that port. I'm not
positive, but I think that number is in the range used for RPC services.

There are programs that can scan large blocks of IP addresses, and look
for specific vulnerabilities. If the scan gets some hits, then an attacker
can try to exploit them later (or the scanning software might even try the
exploit itself).

Anyway, it's up to you how serious you want to take this, but I would
personally not be concerned. There's a lot of this kind of scanning that
happens. If you are going to file an abuse report every time someone hits
a port on your firewall, you are probably going to file a lot of reports.
I would be more concerned about someone who was trying to DoS me, or made
multiple, more persistent attempts to attack me.

Don't know.  Before these helpful messages came through I rebooted the system
with a live CD and am now ensuring everything that needs to be backed up is.

Before I go and wipe the machine I'll try.  It's doubtful though - unless
going into single user mode bypasses PAM and just compares supplied pw to what
is in /etc/shadow I won't be able to get in.

The website's PHP is broken, but if you type in download.html in to the

Progress? Hopefully.

I shut the box down before I left, this morning. Upon returning home 
this afternoon I fired it back up and successfully booted the SuSE 
install CD in rescue mode.

The only odd thing I've noticed is that the BIOS setting for the front 
power button has changed "by itself" from a four second delay to 
immediate to a four second delay. I hadn't noticed that it was a BIOS 
entry until the other day. I was used to the four second delay but 
noticed an immediate shut down after one of my alarm incidents. It 
remained immediate for a couple of days. Then, after the change I made 
this morning, it went back to a four second delay. Weird. I'm hoping 
this is a fluke, and not an indicator of something else!!

I wondered what that funny noise was.

Alas, it's still not resolved. I'll just keep fiddling, and see if I can 
get the OS problem fixed so I can leave the machine on, once it settles 
down. It seems that power cycling is somehow related.

There is a small but nonzero possiblity that the motherboard is
flakey, too.  About the only testing that some motherboards get
is to make sure it fits in the cardboard box ...

You give them the right when you sign the agreement.  You also tell them 
that you will let them change the user agreement at any time, and that 
you agree to never ever take them to court and that you will pay the 
cost of the mediator that would hear your complaint.  You will not run a 
"server" of any kind...including ssh.  You agree to pay more if you hook 
up more than one computer.  Heck you even give them the right to give 
your personal info to companies and entities that they "do business" with.

Read the user agreement.  It is quite interesting.

Forgive me if I haven't been paying close enough attention, but what
makes you think this is an OS problem and not a hardware problem?  And
assuming it is a hardware problem, why have you not returned the

To be honest, I don't know.  I don't know my computer well enough to 
have a clue as to what port is used for what.  It would seem that 
Firestarter was listening.

While that remains a possibility, the motherboard did function for the 
Plug member from whom I obtained it.

An alternate motherboard is in the works. We'll see if it makes a

I think I have two separate problems, but maybe not. On the one hand, 
the motherboard complains intermittently. On the other hand, when it's 
not complaining, I'm trying to resolve a Grub issue that it appears 
others have had. But, to address your last item, a replacement 
motherboard is in the works.

You need to get the patched version of the vmware kernel modules.  Search 
for "vmware-tools-any-update1".

I don't know YUM based distros at all, but isn't there a
kernel-headers package you could install rather than the kernel dev
package?  IIRC, if you use a full kernel tree, you need to at least
configure it to the same config as your running kernel.

FWIW, I don't believe I've ever seen *kernel headers (when installed
separate from the whole src tree)* installed to /usr/src/linux.  But
maybe Fedora or whatever is like that.

kernel-devel is the kernel headers package, but it installed
in /usr/src/kernels/$(uname -r)-$(uname -p)/.  By
convention, /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build is a symlink to kernel
headers, which is where vmware-config.pl looks and then
suggests /usr/src/linux if it fails, since that's conventional.

Yum did install the headers you just have to symlink the kernel tree you want to
use to /usr/src/linux because /usr/src/kernels has the source trees.

And what rights does it grant you?  Is there any way that you as an end user can
get to alter the agreement?

sudo netstat --ip -l -p

That should show you what IP-based services are listening and on which ports.

It is useful to test a running firewall.  Send your IP address to a
friend (for heaven sakes don't post it to the list) who can run nmap
against it.  The firewall prevent abuse from happening, but it is 
good to test it.

That said, as the Internet "matures" - that is, sinks towards senility -
it is loaded with millions of infected machines spewing their little
zombied brains out, rattling every internet address in sight.  If
packets were bullets, you would move to Mogadishu or Bagdhad to get
away from the carnage.  My IP addresses get thousands of such attempts
per day, and my firewall is set to blow off most of them and not even
log them.  I just log the open ports so I can see stuff that actually
should make it through that doesn't.

Oh well.  If computer software was free, and companies like Microsoft
had to find revenue through support sales rather than product sales,
computer viruses would be as common as bystanders getting hit by
parts from exploding Zeppelins.   Oh, the humanity ...

Single-user mode goes directly to a shell prompt.  It doesn't ask for

I just had to deal with a similar issue with an Acronis install on
Fedora.  I fixed it by re-installing the kernel and kernel-devel
packages and rebooting.  The existing /lib/modules/<uname -r>/build
symlink was pointing at a non-existant location.  In other words, the
modules and the headers were out of sync.  Hence the re-install, which
fixed it.

There is another problem you are likely to have with vmware-config.pl.
If the kernel was compiled with a version of gcc that differs from your
gcc version, the install will fail.  The best remedy is to build your
own custom kernel.  Incidentally, building your own kernel also solves
the problem you are having right now.

Distro kernels blow.

Isn't that supposed to be the 'vmware-any-any' patch?  I believe it 
fixes a lot of problems with VMWare on newer Linux distros.  It's a good 
idea to apply this patch regardless of whether you need it or not; at a 
minimum I think it fixes some memory issues and problems with hanging 
when a computer is shut down.

About the original poster's issue with the address space size, there is 
the possibility that your package manager has a newer kernel available 
than the one you are running.  Package managers tend to download kernel 
headers for the newest kernel, which might not be the same version as 
what you're running.  If you've upgraded your kernel at some point and 
not sure that you are running the latest version, you could just try 
restarting as well.  Yes, there are more complex ways of finding out, 
but restarting is probably the easiest if the newest kernel is always 
loaded by default.

(Just for the sake of the archive and continuity of the threads, I'm 
posting this same message in both.)

The problems have been solved by replacing the motherboard and 
processor. (The replacement motherboard already had a processor installed.)

Upon completion of the hardware replacement I re-installed SuSE 10.1. 
This time it ran to completion, and I have successfully set up myself as 
a user and run all the updates. Tomorrow I'll install T-bird, move my 
profile, and get back to using Linux.

Thanks to all for all the helpful suggestions.

I would have to say that the only rights you have are the right not to 
connect, and the right to dis-connect at any time.  Most large high 
speed, broadband, (whatever you want to call it) service providers have 
end user agreements like that.  But seriously they have millions of 
subscribers.  I highly doubt that they have the time or energy to shut 
down everybody running a small web or ftp server.

But why not, when you *do* have the choice, support the service
providers that have more customer-friendly policies, rather than
counting on the draconian ISPs lack of diligence.  Over at the
Personal Telco Project, we know of several ISPs that are *not*
draconian when it comes to, for example, sharing your connection.

One of PTP's founding goals was to route around this kind of monopoly
telco damage.

Russell, what providers have more friendly policies? Who do you (or PTP)
recommend?

I'm not involved in the PTP (not because I object, but because I'm busy
with work and two young kids and I don't know where/how/when to get
involved)...

but I'd still highly recommend DSL-Only.net.  I've used them for about
six years.  They've very IT-friendly (support Linux connections,
sharing, home web servers, mail servers, etc) and inexpensive.

Just my $0.02

  Speakeasy's Wireless Sharing Policy
  
  Speakeasy has been an outspoken supporter of Wireless technology and services
  for quite some time and has one of the most progressive wireless sharing
  policies in the business.
  
  Wireless networking and publicly shared wireless networks present exciting
  new opportunities to share information and connectivity resources with one
  another - we encourage you to explore it!
  
  Speakeasy believes that shared wireless networks are in keeping with our
  core values of disseminating knowledge, access to information and
  fostering community, provided this usage does not have an adverse impact
  on the services of other customers, does not involve any illegal activity
  and is not otherwise in violation of any aspect of our existing Terms Of
  Service. Please remember that the Speakeasy account-holder is responsible
  for all activity originating from their DSL line, even if it is the result
  of other users on a shared wireless connection.

Thats because you're assuming they'd need a person to handle this. They
spend the time to get it automated and they'd have an easy time cracking
down. I'm really surprised they haven't yet done so.

Technically, I guess we don't "recommend" anyone because that might
tread on our non-profit status.  But we have a wiki page that lists
ISP sharing policies (it might be somewhat dated):

  <http://wiki.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/IspWirelessPolicies>

The ones that are obvious winners here are those with official policy
allowing sharing:

  Stephouse Networks
  Easystreet
  Integra
  Speakeasy

Several others are less solidly okay with sharing, but from whom we've
had indications it was okay.

Subject: [PLUG] VMware Install on SuSE
Message-ID: <451F1AFD.6020009@comcast.net>

Has anyone installed VMware on SuSE 10.1, or any other version?

I finished the first part of the process, installing VMware Server 
1.0.1. Next is to install VMware Management Interface. The instructions 
at: http://pubs.vmware.com/server1/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm say 
to install libdb.so.3. I don't find that library in YaST. The helpful 
instruction from the VMware install guide says, "If your distribution CD 
does not have this package, contact your vendor for a suitable library."

Any ideas?

libdb is part of the "db" package.  Look for "db" in YaST.  This is the
Berkeley DB Database.  It would be weird if you didn't already have db
because RPM uses it.  The more likely scenario is that your version is
too old.

See http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/suse/9.3/i386/suse/i686/db-4.3.27-3.1.i686.html

I realize this is a URL to a 9.3 repository, and you have 10.1.  As long
as the package version is good enough, I'm not sure that matters.

Dick,

   What VMware are you installing? Is the workstation? From your description
it seems you have an enterprise release, and I have no idea how to work with
that.

I got the tarball for VMware Server from:

http://register.vmware.com/content/download.html

It's the first one on the Linux list, about halfway down the page. They 
have several other downloads that it looks like they want me to need, 
but I haven't gotten that far.

YaST does indeed have db in its list, and db itself is already 
installed. The list includes db, db1, db1-debuginfo, db1-devel, db40, 
db41, db42 and all the same additional packages as db1 for each of them. 
  At the end of that list are db-debuginfo and db-devel, neither of 
which were installed. I installed db-devel which is described as, 
"Include Files and Libraries for the Berkeley DB library" under the 
assumption that libdb will be one of the libraries.

I haven't downloaded the VMware management program that requires it yet; 
perhaps tomorrow evening.

Thanks for the pointer to the db package.

Since you are using SuSE, download the RPM version and use yast -i
VM*.rpm as root.

That will install it correctly for SuSE.

I look at that one and I don't know if this is still true but I read on 
a forum that the guys at phplist weren't even using their own software 
for their mailling list.  So,  I kind of had a problem with a 
group/company that doesn't even use the software they are trying to

uname -r outputs:
2.6.17-1.2187_FC5

The installed kernel_dev package under /usr/src/kernel is:
2.6.17-1.2187_FC5-i686

Do I have the 386 instead of the 686 headers???

The error I get:
The kernel defined by this directory of header files does not have the same
address space size as your running kernel.

Never had any problem with that specific library.  I think it is part of
either sleepycat or I downloaded it from either Novell's main site or
Packman's (ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/linux/misc/packman/suse/10.0 for me) website.
