Just continue to proceed with caution. In some cases, there are "system
helpful" partitions; my Lenovo (T410) has an NTFS partition with some
diagnostic programs that -- if I'm understanding correctly (haven't
tested recently) -- can help recover from certain kinds of crashes. I
think my Dell e1405 had something similar.

But they were not "system necessary".

Thanks,
Mike

This sounds a bit like the problem described by Matthew Garrett in a 
recent blog entry.

Yes, that is along the same track.  Interestingly enough, the HP docs don't say press F10 (or whatever) on boot ... they say as soon as the power light goes on, start pressing F10 repeatedly (at least once a second, although I tap away rat-a-tat-tat).  That would fit with the keyboard not being initialize until the OS gets around to it.  Progress, you cannot beat it ... well you can, but it still won't go away!

By they way, the Acer tech said to just press F10 and hold it down until the desired result appears.

Paul,

   I've read the m4 man page, info file, and manual (the .pdf version of the
info file) without seeing how I would set up the input files. I assume that
one file contains two tokens, NAME and ADDRESS, but how are they separated
on each line?

   The other file, newsletter.m4, I assume begins with:

GREETING,

   This is the text of the newsletter.

Is this correct?

   Trying to find examples by searching the Web turned up lots of Microsoft
examples but none using GNUm4.

Thanks,

Rich

That was an exercise left to the reader :-) because I don't know how 
you currently store and retrieve your recipients' e-mail addresses.

If all the file contained was the greeting name and e-mail address, 
you could separate them anyway you'd like. A CSV format would be easy, 
but it might break if the greeting name included a comma. A more 
robust file might use a colon, which is unlikely to occur in your 
data. Here's a trivial example:

----- %< -----
billg at microsoft.com:Bill
plug at lists.pdx.org:PLUG Members
president at whitehouse.gov:Mr. President
queen at royal.gov.uk:Madam
----- %< -----

For the template, you're correct, e.g.,

----- %< -----
GREETING,

   This is the text of the newsletter.

   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do 
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad 
minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut 
aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in 
reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla 
pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in 
culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
----- %< -----

A script that used those files -- here assumed to be named 
subscribers.txt and news.m4 -- might work something like this:

while read LINE; do
   ADDR=$(echo $LINE | cut -d: -f1)
   GRTG=$(echo $LINE | cut -d: -f2)
   m4 -D GREETING="$GRTG" news.m4 | mail -s 'June News' $ADDR
done < subscribers.txt

There are, of course, several different ways to accomplish the same 
task, but that might get you started.

An m4 template, by the way, is easy to construct and test, because by 
default m4 sends output to /dev/stdout.

These STS (short term service) releases tend to have more bugs than LTS

I just noticed that after adding a Windows 7 machine to our network, 
/var/log/messages was being filled with DHCPINFORM/DHCPACK messages from 
dnsmasq.  Apparently Windows 7 insists on getting proxy info from dhcp, 
even when there is no proxy.  Adding 'dhcp-option=252,"\n"' to 
dnsmasq.conf eliminates the problem.

Paul,

   Well, ... this reader could not find any examples to use as templates.
Names are in simple text files, not in any application.

   OK. Now, the file contains only the e-mail address. I'll add the
addressee's name to it ...

   ... using a colon. No name has a comma; they're all first names.

   This is an expanded version similar to the one-line script I used with
mailx. Looks good.

   As with everything GNU there are multiple solutions to every problem. :-)
As long as the above works I won't devote more time to looking for different
solutions.

   Aha! I missed that when I read the docs. Certainly makes it easy to test.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

ALERT: I will not be here for the June AT event, might there be any FG 
keyholders who are interested in assisting and perhaps presenting?

Who: Russel Senior
What: Hacking on the new Beagle Bone Black
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, June 6th, 2013 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of technology freedom

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg

Hacking on the new Beagle Bone Black

Russell recently spent some time working on porting a house-monitoring 
system from the Beagle Bone (an $89 embedded, ARM-based, I/O rich device 
running linux http://beagleboard.org/) to the new Beagle Bone Black, a 
$45 device which is faster, includes video and 2G of onboard flash. The 
sensors required a one-wire bus, one of which the original Beagle Bone 
had configured out of the box. The Beagle Bone Black had none. This talk 
is a description of what it took to get one-wire (specifically w1-gpio) 
going with his own custom "cape" (a daughter-board for the Beagle Bone).

Hacking on the new Beagle Bone Black

Russell recently spent some time working on porting a house-monitoring 
system from the Beagle Bone (an $89 embedded, ARM-based, I/O rich device 
running linux http://beagleboard.org/) to the new Beagle Bone Black, a 
$45 device which is faster, includes video and 2G of onboard flash. The 
sensors required a one-wire bus, one of which the original Beagle Bone 
had configured out of the box. The Beagle Bone Black had none. This talk 
is a description of what it took to get one-wire (specifically w1-gpio) 
going with his own custom "cape" (a daughter-board for the Beagle Bone).

There is a free open source software on Sourceforge that I would like

John,

May I assume (*cough*) from your Subject: line that you want to
convert this package from whatever format it's in to something
that can be installed by either yum/rpm or apt/dpkg?

If so, I have a question for you:  Why?

Okay, I'm not really trying to be snarky (well, maybe a little),
but there's really no need to do that.  Package managers are
persnickety buggers.  For simply installing something you've found
on the 'net, they're probably more trouble than they're worth.

So tell us what you have; that way we can tell you how to build
it.  If it's the usual sort of tarball, with an Autotools-packaged
project inside, it should be easy.  (Assuming [there's that word
again] that you have all the dependencies the program needs.  If
not, you're going to have to track them down and install them
before you can build your new program.)

OTOH, if you really do need to distribute .rpm and/or .deb
packages, I'm sure that the list can help with that, too.
(Optimistic, ain't I?)

I can't help much with rpm (and not at all with dpkg), but you'll
need to read the man page for rpmbuild(8).  At the minimum, you
will also need to install rpmlint and rpmdevtools.

Exciting stuff.  Here's some general options, from easiest to hardest:
1. Find a package someone else already built.
2. Build from source and use as-is, unpackaged.
3. Build a package using a manifest from a similar or older version.
4. Build a package from a new manifest.

1. Finding a package:
Many folks build packages that never make it into the regular repositories.
Often those are gathered into other repositories, such as EPEL or DAG (RPM)
or Launchpad (DEB).  Others just sit on webpages and such, waiting to be
Googled.  Those packages can be installed, though you might want to add the
repo so you get any dependent packages.

2. Building from source:
You already looked for a package, and just want to try a program out.
Download the tarball, expand it ("tar -zxvf blah.tar.gz" or
"tar -jxvf blah.tar.bz2") and look for README and INSTALL files.
Also look for "Makefile" or "configure".
You will probably have to install development tools and libraries to build
the program, INSTALL may have some info on that.  On Ubuntu/Debian, that's
covered by the "build-essential" package, on CentOS/RH, the "Development
Tools" group.  After that, there will be some libblah-dev or libblah-devel
packages to cover some specific libraries used by the program.  I usually
take a "run make, install libraries when it breaks, repeat" approach.

3-4. Building your own package:
If you are supplying the program for ther Linux users or for many machines,
it may be worth setting aside a few days to learn how to package it
yourself, or convincing someone to do it for you.

If you can say what program it is, folks might be able to offer more
specific pointers.

Regards,
  Aaron

I wasn't clear about a few facts. First, I do want to make the package
available to other Linux users, and not all (including me) are capable
of installing from source. In my own case, in the years I have been
using Linux exclusively on my computers I have tried to install from
source about half a dozen times. All were failures, the most recent
being a development version of Scribus. And several of them were with
experienced Linux users sitting next to me. I am not averse to trying
it again, but since I want to make packages available to others, the
more logical approach seems to be to build the packages.

I am familiar with alien and have successfully used it several times to
convert .deb to .rpm and vice versa. In fact, when I first started
using the program in question there was no 64-bit .rpm file, although
there was a 64-bit .deb package. I used alien to convert it and it is
running on my Fedora laptop as I write this.

The problem with my current installation is that it is pretty buggy,
although it does more or less work. The developer released a new
version only a few days ago and I want to try it. 

The program is Sleepyhead, available here:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/sleepyhead/?source=directory

In fact, I have not yet located the source for the new version, but I
assume it is there on Sourceforge somewhere. I thought I'd start by
asking if what I want to do is possible.

It may be necessary to wait until the next Clinic to accomplish what I
want.

Message-ID: <CAJeYwHetyNph6OPeAuX50n+E0jAGzYZUjtjjXFH_s2-oUOcC6g@mail.gmail.com>

I have always upgraded my Ubuntu files using the automatic Upgrade
Manager.  Unfortunately, I have lost the ability to talk from my main
computer to 2 other machines on the LAN network.  What do I need to
do, so that I can talk to them?  The dhcp3 server seems okay, when
enabled by the "service isc-dhcp-ipv4 restart" command, but running
tcpdump at the client computers shows that no IVP4 information is
being exchanged but strange bootps IVP6 information is occurring.

How do I fix all this, so I can talk from the sever to the 2 clients?

(p.s.: I hate doing Ubuntu upgrades and losing local connectivity)

Well, looks like option 1 or 3 are available to you:
http://wtogami.fedorapeople.org/pkgreview/sleepyhead/
via http://wtogami.blogspot.com/

Looks like Mr. Togami is building it, and has made a source RPM available.
So if he can't be convinced to build an up-to-the-minute version, we could
extract the RPM spec from his source RPM and use that to build one.

The most up-to-date version is in a Git repo, but hasn't seen any changes
since Jan 15 2013.  So Warren Togami's F18 RPM should be up to date.

That's really interesting software, incidentally.  We have an unused CPAP
kicking around (a boil-and-bite mouthpiece worked better) so I should see
if I can talk to it.

No. Those are the version I am currently running. In fact the 64-bit
.rpm was my doing. There was a 64-bit .deb, but no .rpm, so I used
alien to convert the .deb to .rpm, installed it successfully on my
Fedora laptop, then e-mailed it to the developer so he could upload it
to Sourceforge.

I would do the same with the latest version if I could some day figure
out how to make packages from source.

In my experience, building manually packages from source is not a
trivial undertaking.  However, years ago I successfully used a program
called "checkinstall" that almost fully automated the process of
building from source and creating a package.  Looks like it's still
around:

  When make install is done, CheckInstall will create a Slackware, RPM
  or Debian compatible package and install it...

That is interesting. I did not realize there were packages in the
Fedora repos. However, those packages are 2 February 2013, which is
newer than the one I currently have installed, but the latest release
is 19 May 2013.

Not if it's 2 February 2013, but maybe he can be convinced to make a
newer one. And if he does he should also send it to Mark Watkins
(JediMark, the developer) so he can put them on Sourceforge for others
to download.

The main issue with the mouth devices is that you have no way to tell
if the therapy is adequate without a sleep study. My doc billed $2500
for my sleep study, and that is the norm, although there are cheaper
take-home devices. Mouth devices are also known to alter the mouth
geography over time - like braces. And they are not usually adequate if
the apnea is severe. 

Using a data capable blower with software like Sleepyhead almost makes
the sleep doctor irrelevant, given a patient with sufficient knowledge
to interpret the daily results and the motivation to do so.
Unfortunately, few patients meet those criteria so sleep doctoring is
likely to continue to be a growth industry.

Again, the last change in the git repo was Jan 15 2013, so while the latest
Windows binary may have a newer date, the source code it was built from
likely is no newer than what built the good Mr. Togami's RPM.

Indeed.  A sleep study was done, marginal Apnea was diagnosed, CPAP was
prescribed as part of a medical study.  CPAP helped, but was cumbersome and
interfered(!) with sleep.  Tried a mouthpiece, it helped breathing at least
as well without interfering with sleep.

Generally true for many, many things.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

ALERT: I will not be here for the June AT event, might there be any FG 
keyholders who are interested in assisting and perhaps presenting?

Who: Russell Senior
What: Hacking on the new Beagle Bone Black
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, June 6th, 2013 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of technology freedom

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg

Hacking on the new Beagle Bone Black

Russell recently spent some time working on porting a house-monitoring 
system from the Beagle Bone (an $89 embedded, ARM-based, I/O rich device 
running linux http://beagleboard.org/) to the new Beagle Bone Black, a 
$45 device which is faster, includes video and 2G of onboard flash. The 
sensors required a one-wire bus, one of which the original Beagle Bone 
had configured out of the box. The Beagle Bone Black had none. This talk 
is a description of what it took to get one-wire (specifically w1-gpio) 
going with his own custom "cape" (a daughter-board for the Beagle Bone).

Biography:

Russell Senior has been a GNU/Linux user for over 20 years, since the 
0.99plN days, using it both recreationally and professionally as a 
research programmer/scientific data analyst. Since 2005, Russell has 
become involved as a principal volunteer with the Personal Telco Project 
(https://personaltelco.net), during which he has worked on embedded 
systems, primarily network routers. He contributes to the development 
and improvement of the OpenWrt project. In the last couple years, he has 
worked on monitoring systems involving Arduino and, since last year, the 
Beagle Bone and has learned a bit about the Angstrom distribution of 
linux for embedded devices.

This is a perfect LMGTFY moment. Because I'm not finding it. 

Is
IPv6 enabled by default in common Linux distros? Where is this
documented? 

The question came up while I was investigating an issue at
work and saw IPv6 connections between a server and its database server.


I know, and confirmed, there's no IPv6 routing in our internal
network. The DB server is in a secure enclave, so I know the traffic
routed. 

But both endpoints are Linux servers, they are tunneling IPv6
through IP4.

If you install RHEL6 from the Red Hat DVD it is.  And, I believe, the same is true for RHEL5.

IPv6 is going to be  enabled on most by default but notably if you do
not have IPv6 enabled at your router or even at the ISP level then in
my experience disabling it can save milliseconds to even a few seconds
to make the initial network handshake on Wifi or via Ethernet.

Subject: [PLUG] Editing a video DVD
Message-ID: <20130609220357.GB15740@gate.kl-ic.com>

What is the simplest way to use Linux tools to take a non-copy-
protected video DVD apart, remove the first 9.5 minutes of the
content, and make a new DVD with the same menus, etc? 

The particular DVD is the recording of an awards ceremony at a
conference, where a really wonderful person was introduced by
a foulmouthed idiot MC.  Before I share the DVD with others,
I would like to edit out the MC.  Most of the people at the
ceremony would like to do the same with their brains.  While I
can tell people to fast forward to 9:30, or just turn off the
sound, they may be tempted to listen to Mr. Nasty, and there
are some things (like goatse) which you cannot un-know.

So, which tool is easiest?  I don't want to become an editing
guru, just edit out one of nature's mistakes.

I THINK k9copy MIGHT work.

I needed something to quickly copy a DVD to hard drive, k9copy did the job.
 It has a wizard where you specify the parts you want to copy. I just
copied everything, you might be able to just get by with that.  So, Are you
feeling lucky Kieth?

   Hacking on the new Beagle Bone Black

   Russell recently spent some time working on porting a house-monitoring 
   system from the Beagle Bone (an $89 embedded, ARM-based, I/O rich device 
   running linux http://beagleboard.org/) to the new Beagle Bone Black, a 
   $45 device which is faster, includes video and 2G of onboard flash. The 
   sensors required a one-wire bus, one of which the original Beagle Bone 
   had configured out of the box. The Beagle Bone Black had none. This talk 
   is a description of what it took to get one-wire (specifically w1-gpio) 
   going with his own custom "cape" (a daughter-board for the Beagle Bone).

   Biography:

   Russell Senior has been a GNU/Linux user for over 20 years, since the 
   0.99plN days, using it both recreationally and professionally as a 
   research programmer/scientific data analyst. Since 2005, Russell has 
   become involved as a principal volunteer with the Personal Telco Project 
   (https://personaltelco.net), during which he has worked on embedded 
   systems, primarily network routers. He contributes to the development 
   and improvement of the OpenWrt project. In the last couple years, he has 
   worked on monitoring systems involving Arduino and, since last year, the 
   Beagle Bone and has learned a bit about the Angstrom distribution of 
   linux for embedded devices.

   Interesting situation here that I've not been able to resolve on my own.
My Web search found a thread on the postfix-users mail archive that says the
problem is a mis-configured MTA on the sender's end yet I'm not able to
reject this stream of incoming messages. I'm running postfix-2.10.0.

   This started Saturday when I found a few dozen of these messages in my
INBOX (and in /var/log/maillog):

   'whois' told me that IP address is assigned to Saudi Arabla. As I have no
expectation of legitimate messages from that country I took the following
steps:

   - Blocked Saudi Arabia CIDR ranges in /etc/postfix/cidr and entered a line
in /etc/postfix/main.cf to check that file.

   - Added the string, bab at bab.com, in /etc/postfix/header_checks.

   Despite these, each day brings a flood of such messages. What I would like
to learn is why the UCE rules are not being honored and rejecting these
messages before they enter the system. I've no issues with any other CIDR
blocks or header_checks.

   Fixed the problem by putting the UCE strings in the body_checks rather
than the header_checks. Sigh. Mea culpa!

Not very lucky.  I can do the same with K3B.  No, I want to chop off
the front of one of the video segments, start the modified DVD with
the rest of that same segment, keep the metadata,  and keep the
simple-but-better-than-I-can-design menu structure of the disk. 
That sounds hard to do without a lot of knowledge of DVD structure
or some capable tools that will lead me through the process.  

I downloaded the k9copy source, did not find any documentation, and
the author is no longer supports the tool.  I'll keep looking, thanks!

Keith

P.S. Indeed,  I may just pay the original author of the disk $$$ to
rebuild it for me.  The problem is he doesn't answer phone or email.

I have experience in backing up DVD's, but not too much in the reverse
of creating DVD's, that said, here is one process that could get your
job done.

Essentially you  follow the instructions in the example at the bottom
of this post
http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/77834/how-to-rip-a-scratched-dvd-video-a-cdparanoia-for-dvds

but after doing the dvdbackup -m you need to edit the vob file to
remove the unwanted parts.
For that you can use a utility called gopchop
http://gopchop.sourceforge.net/
for which there exists a Debian package, but I don't know about Redhat.

If this does not work, use any mpeg2 video editor.
Then continue the steps in the example to put the DVD back together.

Message-ID: <CANkHAjefo_3uJ90PQ=mLWJjH0RQ0mBR3xX2rvYWfjYtkXmhAAg@mail.gmail.com>

Open Source Bridge is only a week away, June 18-??21.  Registration is
still open and tickets are $300 for a full pass, $99 if you're a student or
free if you're able to volunteer 8 hours of your time to help make the
conference a success; OS Bridge is a 100% volunteer-run conference.  Many
of the volunteer positions are really straightforward and some involve
little more than attending a talk and ensuring the speaker has everything
they need (A/V cable, glass of water, etc).  A community pass is also
available for free which gets you into most of the evening events and the
all-day unconference on Friday.

For a schedule and list of sessions being presented this year:

That article confuses me. I didn't listen to the audio, but the headline is
"Why PRISM is powered by *private-sector *technology", and then they go on
to talk about how the NSA uses open-source software. I get that companies
in the private sector contribute to the development of hadoop, but that
headline is misleading.

I also have to echo the comment at the bottom (at this time, the only
comment on the post):

"I don't understand the point of this article. It is critical of the
government for not having created something as good as Hadoop. So when
private companies use Hadoop, it is smart and cool, but when the government
uses it, it shows how inadequate they are? If the government did spend the
money developing its own system, I'm sure it would be criticized for
wasting money and not using what's available in the private sector. Again,
what is the point?"

Is this post just a badly-worded summary of the audio?

Message-ID: <51B8158F.5070007@ambidexter.com>


Hello all,

It is highly unlikely that I will be around for the June Advanced Topics 
talk.

For the record, a Free Geek keyholder and long-time participant has 
questions about various strategies on package building. May I kindly ask 
that people chime in with either their specific desires for knowledge or 
with an offer of packaging insights? Or both?

Keep in mind: A 'talk' need not have slides or even a structure. 
Expertise and a positive attitude are all that are needed to enable a 
worthwhile dialog. That, plus the courage to sit before an audience. 
That took me a decade or two but now I'm wrangling upset neighbors at 
the neighborhood association! You can too!

Thank you to the folks that suggested gopchop - I was able to edit the
nasty bits out of VOB file.   The truncated file plays back properly
with mplayer. 

A problem remains with reassembing the DVD with K3B and playing it on
the DVD player, which does not play back the sound from the VOB file
I edited or the VOB file that follows.  PEBK&C, probably.  I'll frob
on it some more and report back in a day or two.

Folks, 

Just saw a listing on the PDX Tech Professionals Linkedin group for a
"free" OSCON expo pass, using code:

PDXEXPO

(there's reportedly also a 20% discount on OSCON packages with code
PDXTECH).

(I would test it myself, but have already been registered by the company
I work for.)

Thanks,

I just registered for the expo pass using this.  I can confirm that this

   This message frequently pops up on the command line:

which tells me what I already know. I've not tracked what triggers

You (or your system defaults) probably set MAIL or MAILPATH
variables in your shell environment.  They're probably either in
bashrc or .profile.

If you're not using bash, I know that zsh and ksh use the same
variables for the same reason, so unsetting them is likely to
solve your problem, but are likely going to be in .zshrc or
kshrc respectively.

The following is sourced from: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Variables.html

MAIL
	If this parameter is set to a filename or directory name
	and the MAILPATH variable is not set, Bash informs the
	user of the arrival of mail in the specified file or
	Maildir-format directory.

MAILPATH
	A colon-separated list of filenames which the shell
	periodically checks for new mail. Each list entry can
	specify the message that is printed when new mail arrives
	in the mail file by separating the file name from the
	message with a `?'. When used in the text of the message,
	$_ expands to the name of the current mail file.

Message-ID: <20130614221650.GB3186@gate.kl-ic.com>

This time of year reminds me of my friend Junie.  Her husband
Ollie is in prison for making an illegal copy of Windows.  I'm
in contact with the escape committee, Linux users who are also
fond of Rodgers and Hammerstein show tunes.  So when I got a
singing phone call, "June is busting out Oliver!" ...

I don't want any more punnishing telephone calls, or friends in
jail for using the wrong operating system.  Before the Business
Software Alliance sends the cops to break down your front door,
sneak out the back with your computer, and bring it to Free Geek
at 1731 SE 10th Avenue (three blocks south of Hawthorne) Sunday
June 16 between 1pm and 5pm.

We will erase the evidence, replacing it with Linux (perhaps even
BSD) in your choice of decorator colors and distros!   No worries
about fingerprints - we have keyboards, monitors, and mice that
the cops will never find.  Yes We Scan?  No!  Free Geek has wired
and wireless internet for your anonymous Internet pleasure.  We
don't do good-cop/bad-cop - but we do have good and bad Linux
advice (your choice) from our skilled team of easily distractable
look at the pretty butterfly!

We have coffee and snacks.  We may not have a cake with a file
baked in it, but we have cake packs of CDs and DVDs onto which
we can bake all the files you want!

So - escape from the prison of Windows, and join us this third
Sunday for Linux Clinic!

Keith,

   I see you're competing with Pearls Before Swine.

   Easier to simply defenestrate.

   While your prose stimulates the Friday afternoon of all who read it I
suspect that the Microserfs to whom you address your erudite literary
efforts do not subscribe to our mail list. That's too bad ... they avoid the
groaners.

Carpe weekend,

Free Geek would normally recycle these. At the moment however our
upstream vendor is not taking plastic: China is not taking in any
plastic at the moment  so its all siting in warehouses downstream and we
have very limited space so we might not take them at all at the moment.

So, what flavor BSD and what program?  iIf it's NetBSD I might be helpful,
others probably not so much.  A good resource are the distro-specific mailing
lists and IRC channels (irc.freenode.net).

Subject: [PLUG] ReactOS - lucrative opportunity?
Message-ID: <20130618194110.GA21285@gate.kl-ic.com>

The Sourceforge project of the month is ReactOS, an open source
functional equivalent of WinXP.  I haven't tested it yet, but it
looks nifty! 

http://sourceforge.net/blog/potm-201306/

I run about three windoze apps on a virtual Win2000 guest inside
VMWare - that was the last version of Windoze that didn't "phone
home" for permission from M$.  I look forward to upgrading that
stack to Virtualbox and ReactOS, so that the only remaining M$
code on my machine is Internet Explorer (which I run only to make
sure my web pages don't break on that broken browser).

Folks come to the clinic hoping to make their Windoze machines
dual boot.  If ReactOS works as well as I hope, and the developer
team can stay ahead of M$ attempts to redesign apps so they don't
work on it, we can offer virtualization on top of Linux instead. 

Folks wanting to do this should have at least a gigabyte of RAM
on their machine. I strongly suggest leaving the old windoze hard
drive alone, and spending $100 on a new hard drive that we will
install Linux and VirtualBox and ReactOS on.  With both drives
connected (using an external case for the old laptop drive, another
$50) we can transfer files off the old drive to the new guest. 
The old drive will still be around for warranty repairs and such.

This means big bucks for those proficient in ReactOS migration.  
The state of Oregon has thousands of WinXP machines and millions
of dollars of custom applications running on them.  The EOL for
WinXP is putting the government in a severe bind; redeveloping
all that code for Win8 would cost more millions and cause great
disruption.  Converting to ReactOS guests on a Linux host could
save the state millions now, and prevent millions more per year
from heading north to Redmond.  Over time, new custom apps running
on Linux can interact with the old apps running on ReactOS.

I can hear the John Lennon mashup now:
 "Imagine there's no Windows. 
  It's easy if you try.
  No hell in software.
  No bad upgrades to buy ..."

So who wants to take the lead on this for PLUG? 
  
Keith

Subject: [PLUG] MythTV?
Message-ID: <51C10162.5020209@comcast.net>

Trying to find current info on MythTV is a bit frustrating. Many of the
sites I've enthusiastically read end up being from 2005 or before. I
just tried going to the Knoppix based KnoppMyth at
http://www.mysettopbox.tv/knoppmyth.html. I get a short page with a link
that is broken. I read on the MythDora page that the maintainer is
dropping the project. The Mythbuntu page talks about problems running
Mythbuntu in the 12.04 LTS distribution, which doesn't sound right, but
does add to the confusion.

Is anybody on the list running a Myth box? And can you point me to
current information I can use to set up a Myth box?

Thanks.

BTW, my plan will be to record HDTV content from an antenna, and not to
record programming from cable.

I'm running Mythbuntu 11.10, which uses mythtv 0.24.2.  It runs 
reasonably well for recording OTA TV.  Other pieces(mythmusic, 
mythvideo, etc.) work, but have some rough edges.  Note that my setup 
has separate frontend and backend machines, so that adds to the 
complexity.  I suspect 12.04+0.25 would address some of my complaints, 
but it is working well enough that it is hard to justify the risk of 
breaking things.

For hardware, I've got an Sandy Bridge i3 for the backend.  It has four 
1 TB disks configured as two 1 TB RAID1 devices.  My tuner is a 
SiliconDust HDHomerun connected to an antenna in my attic.  I'm ~5 miles 
from the Portland transmitter towers.  My frontend box is a Zotac Ion 
system.  It feels a bit underpowered, but it works.  My preference today 
would be for Intel video, avoiding proprietary video drivers.  This 
assumes they've gotten the kinks out of the VAAPI stuff.

If I were starting today, I would probably get my feet wet with 
Mythbuntu 12.04.2.  This would get you MythTV 0.25.  There's definitely 
a learning curve, so don't expect to get everything perfect the first 
time.  By the time you get some experience with it, 14.04 will be just 
around the corner.  14.04 will probably have 0.26.  Around May 2014 you 
can decide whether to keep what you've got, or to move to 14.04.  This 
assumes the Mythbuntu people decide to move to 14.04.

BTW, I have an extra HDHomerun that I'll let you have for a very good 
price.  I spotted it at Freegeek one day and snapped it up even though I 
already have one.

I wasn't planning on going to the meeting tonight, but if you're going 
to be at the Lab, I'll make it a point to drop by.

I'm running Myth under Ubuntu 12.04 (Mythbuntu 12.04 64-bit). I can't say I've 
had any real problems with it. The Mythbuntu.org support page has a number of 
links, including to the MythTV wiki at http://www.mythtv.org/wiki.

Was there something specific mentioned about 12.04?

That's what I'm doing. My intent was to cut the cord with Cable/Satellite and 
stop wasting $1,000+/year just to watch TV. I took the easy approach, and got 
an HDHomerun. I was so happy with it I bought a 2nd later on. Stay away from 
the HDHomerun Prime. The 3 tuners is tempting, but it's cable-only. And for the 
same price you can get two 2-tuner units.

The only real problem I had was getting audio to work over HDMI using the 
internal on-board ATI hardware. I eventually gave up and got an inexpensive 
(and fan-less) nVidia card, and use the proprietary driver.

There's an annoying bug where it loses track of where it is if you're watching 
live TV and the programming transitions to the next show... it works OK, but 
always says it's at the end of the stream and doesn't skip forward/backward 
very well. But I have no problems with recorded shows.

You'll also want to avoid using the OTA embedded channel guide data. If there 
are any reception problems it will end up filling the logfile with error 
messages. Stick with Schedules Direct, it's worth the $25/yr.

Working well and left alone (except for normal updates) is my approach
in general. I delayed upgrading from 10.04 to 12.04 until this winter.
I'm still using 10.04 on a separate machine for some things that broke
with 12.04. Sigh.

I want to set up a separate backend machine and do a couple of front end
machines, since I have a second TV. It will be interesting to see if I
can put an antenna in the right place to get a signal. I'm east of
Oregon City, and near the crest of a hill (going downhill to the south,
unfortunately). It may be possible to put an antenna in the attic. How
well does UHF travel through cedar shingles?

I hope to be able to have a separate machine to set a new backend up
when that time comes. Any idea whether frontends and backends have to be
the same version?

Thanks for the info. Once I get started I'm sure I'll be asking lots of
questions.

The one I recall seeing was some conflict with Unity, but I don't find
it this morning. But maybe that was upgrading rather than a fresh install.

Good to know. Thanks.

That might not be a real issue for me. I'm planning to set up the stereo
with the TV and route the sound through the good speakers anyway.

It is extremely rare that we watch live TV anymore. We've been really
spoiled by the automatic commercial skip on recorded shows. I think the
last time we watched live was during the Super Bowl when we actually
were interested in seeing the commercials -- well, some of them.

I have Schedules Direct in use on my ReplayTV.

Thanks for the info.

 "It may be possible to put an antenna in the attic. How

Having a UHF telly antenna inside or in attic should reduce your signal by
about 50%.  However, your antenna should last a lot longer before being
degraded by the elements.  So, as long as your reception to your fav
stations is strong enough, it's probably worth it to put your antenna in
the attic.  You can test it out on the roof vs. in the attic 1st.   You can
use a small TV & one of those ATSC converter boxes, or if you have a small
atsc TV.  Let us know what you find.

Cheers,

Elcaset

Setting up a DTV antenna won't be a problem anywhere in the house. I
built a DIY antenna an hung it on a hook next the the 1080p LCD TV
(pretty much center of house). The signal is digital and pokes through
a house like a hot knife through butter. Antenna signal degradation is
an analog problem from the TV Dark Ages.

All modern HDTVs have built in DTV tuners - just make sure the card
you use for MythTV has one as well, then you won't need converters.
You will need to be pretty far out, and in an RF shadow (Mt Hood) not
to pick up Portlands DTV broadcasts.

I haven't used MythTV in a while (had an analog tuner back in NM) so I
might give the new version a try on Slackware.

Actually, that's not completely true. The signals can be frustratingly 
susceptible to multi-path interference issues. I live only about 5 miles from 
the towers in Beaverton, with no hills in between. But I have a lot of trees 
around the property, including directly in the line-of-sight between the 
antenna and the towers. I had to take out two trees and trim a couple of others 
before I could get a reasonable lock on most of the channels. Before that any 
time it rained or the wind blew it would shred the signal.

Agreed.  There is some controversy over the choice of modulation for 
ATSC broadcasts.  North America uses 8VSB.  Some argue that we would be 
better off having chosen COFDM, as used in Europe.  COFDM allegedly 
works better in a multipath environment.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8VSB

With respect to antennas, here in Portland a combined VHF/UHF antenna is 
needed.  NBC, OPB, and Fox are all on VHF.  With analog broadcasts the 
VHF band was split into two pieces, 2-6 and 7-13.  After the digital 
transition, only 7-13 is used.  Also, the UHF band now ends at channel 51.

There's lots of good info here:
http://www.hdtvprimer.com/ISSUES/erecting_antenna.html
http://www.antennaweb.org/Default.aspx

In the metro area, an indoor antenna may be sufficient, but it's not 
unusual for multipath or rain to cause the picture to go from perfect to 
unwatchable.

FWIW, I have a Winegard HD-7694P in my attic.  I also have a Winegard 
HDP-269 high input pre-amp in order to drive a long cable run plus 
multiple splitters.

It's my understanding that with DTV signals, those two are your only options. Perfect or unwatchable.

Agreed.  Can't we "react" to an opportunity to run legacy windows
apps on a non-M$ platform?

BTW, more websearch shows that ReactOS is still early alpha but
making progress fast.  The biggest missing chunk (IMHO) is NTFS
compatability; for now it works with FATxx only.  The project's
focus at this time is on improving binary compatability for
applications.  For those of us who run a handful of apps like
Quickbooks, and test the occasional linux-generated file with
Word or Explorer, that is close to adequate.

ReactOS is not Linux, but it will support ExtN and the other
Linux file systems eventually.  For new deployments, that is
probably good enough.  Export your WinX files to a FAT32 
partition, and move them to a modern file system from there.

While ReactOS is not ready for wide deployment today, early
adopters will be the first to benefit from wide deployment
when it does happen.

Funny and a bit concerning how the mind works some times. Thank you Keith
for the good and thorough write-up. I think you made some very salient
points worth considering

As I'm quite ignorant of all things ReactOS, the one question I have is, is
ReactOS a good bridge or transition from WinXP to Linux? Or do people think
Ubuntu and browser based apps are so user friendly now that it makes this
transition step unnecessary?

Cheers,

Mike

User friendliness isn't the issue, in this case.  Projects like ReactOS &
WINE are useful for those few Windows apps that are still necessary in some
cases.

That's basically true.  There's perfect, barely watchable, & unwatchable.
And those moments of barely watchable are pretty few & far between.

ReactOS is an interesting project, but is quite a bit behind the WINE
project. I'd so its got a good 5+ years to go to catch up. WINE can be
glitchy for some win apps, but the rate of dev and responsiveness to
fixes is very good.  I use WINE and Dosbox for legacy apps (and games
too) and have been rarely disappointed.

I have a 1TB drive that is a couple years old. Palimpsest says "103 bad
sectors, disk is OK." That seems like a lot of bad sectors. Is that
really OK?

For a 1TB disk that's within tolerance. What's more important is
the number when you originally bought the drive, and whether or not
the number is increasing.  I would make a backup and then watch it
carefully.  If you see any increase over a period of a month or less,
replace it.

All depends on sector size, sectors/track, etc. I wouldn't worry.
Under Ubuntu you can check the SMART data with 'disk utility' to see
if the drive is reporting impending doom.

 Try something like

# fdisk -l /dev/sdx

(sudo if you must...) to list the sector size and number of sectors.
If your fdisk defaults to "cylinders" use

# fdisk -lu=sectors

Also, check out

# smartctl -a /dev/sda

To view SMART capabilties and status (see man page).

Hard drives lose a few sectors all the time as they age. No worries
unless the rate goes way up.  For example, my 160GB laptop drive has
312581808 sectors of 512 bytes (ext4). 100 sectors would be a very
small % error.  As long as there is enough room to reallocate and the
bad sector count does not keep increasing, I wouldn't worry.  That
said, "never put all your eggs in one basket" - multiple backups are
important.

Thanks to all who responded. The question came up because my desktop
computer was running really slow and the disks were thrashing - disk
light constantly on or at least flickering. I used Palimpsest to check
the disks and that is when I noticed that there were 103 bad sectors on
the 1TB disk.

I later tracked the problem down to Banshee. I disabled almost all of
the extensions and now it behaves as it should. Apparently it was
constantly downloading music data from Amazon, emusic, and a dozen
other places. My world is back to normal.

Subject: [PLUG] round robin mysql
Message-ID: <8C300379-85BE-49C8-9022-1BEBBEC04349@dimstar.net>

Has anyone else used round robin mysql servers? Where each server is a master and slave, like so:

+-->1-->2-->3-->4-->n+1->+
+<----<-------<-------<--+

I'm thinking something like that with a load balancer in front of it would allow me to run fewer total db servers, and at the same time, if one goes down, things don't stop in their tracks. I'd rather have more of a star topology, but I don't see a real way to have 3 or more masters that are also slaves of each other. I can see a possible failure if, for example, node 3 goes down, node 4 and up won't get updates anymore until something does a SWITCH MASTER TO on node 4, but that can be scripted. 

Ideas? Suggestions? Reasons why I shouldn't do this?

Background: I'm currently working with several mysql servers that are running in a master-->slave configuration. I'd like to find a way to make this so it's not quite as fragile.

I've done it. It's a huge headache. As in, 3 hours a day getting everything
working right again after a simple "ALTER TABLE" breaks all the things, or
a transaction doesn't make it through (etc.).

So, at a minimum, I'm thinking of switching to master<>master. At least then if something goes down, I can get things back up by just repointing things. Then repairing the damage can happen while things continue to work.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1306220830210.1471@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My Nikon CoolPix puts all file names in uppercase and I want to convert
them to lowercase names. I've tried a shell script Wil Cooley provided in
2005 but it's not working for me. I'd greatly appreciate learning where the
syntax is incorrect.

   Here is a representative file name:

DSCN0064.JPG

   Here's Wil's script:

for FiLe in *; do
     file=$(echo "${FiLe}"|tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
     echo mv -i "${FiLe}" "${file}"
done

   When I copy this to the command line the output is:

mv -i

for each file in the subdirectory.

Remove the second echo
     echo mv -i "${FiLe}" "${file}"
->
      mv -i "${FiLe}" "${file}"

Does your system have a command called "rename" available?  It's a
very handy Perl script that's been around for years, and does exactly
what its name implies.  It applies a Perl regex to the name of each
file passed to it.  E.g., to convert all upper case characters in a
file name to lower case:

  rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' DSC*

This worked for me ... please note that there are four back tics (`) in 
the script ...
     surrounding the `ls DSC*`
     surrounding the `(echo "${FiLe}"|tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')`
... and I added the DSC* to be a little more specific in which files to 
change.
Regards
Fred James

#! /bin/bash
for FiLe in `ls DSC*`
do
      file=`(echo "${FiLe}"|tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')`
      mv ${FiLe} ${file}
done

Bill,

   Wil suggested the second echo to test before borking the files.

> Or maybe you could turn the camera upside down?

   Or stand on my head? Like too many things the Nikon assumption is that
everyone slavishly uses whatever Microsoft is selling at the time.

Thanks,

   Looks sed-like.

Paul,

   That did not work. But after reading the man page I found that

 	rename .JPG .jpg *.JPG

works just fine.

   Thanks again for reminding me of rename's existence.

here is your problem... after testing, you're supposed to remove the echo
and run it again to "do it live"

wes,

   If I don't see the correct output echoed to the console then my assumption
is that running it 'live' will move all file names to one, incorrect one.
The second echo should, if I correctly read the script, print the results of
the mv command to the screen.

The -i switch  to mv will prevent that, since it will prompt you before
overwriting an existing file
(or just -n to never overwrite) the -v switch might also be useful as it
will tell you what it's doing.

$() does what backticks do with the added advantage of being readable
and easier to use. 
Backticks exist as legacy syntax from very old pre_POSIx compatible
bourne shells and there is no good reason to be using them.

for FiLe in DSC*

Simplier would be to just pipe the verified output into your shell, assuming bash:


michael at bivy:/srv/photo/365_2012/this_month/296_Jun_21/t$ ls
OM211853.JPG  OM211854.JPG  OM211863.JPG  OM211864.JPG  tsh
michael at bivy:/srv/photo/365_2012/this_month/296_Jun_21/t$ ./tsh        # run to verify, "tsh" is Rich's original script
mv -i OM211853.JPG om211853.jpg
mv -i OM211854.JPG om211854.jpg
mv -i OM211863.JPG om211863.jpg
mv -i OM211864.JPG om211864.jpg
mv -i tsh tsh
michael at bivy:/srv/photo/365_2012/this_month/296_Jun_21/t$ ./tsh | bash # sent to shell for execution
mv: `tsh' and `tsh' are the same file
michael at bivy:/srv/photo/365_2012/this_month/296_Jun_21/t$ ls           # verify results
om211853.jpg  om211854.jpg  om211863.jpg  om211864.jpg  tsh
michael at bivy:/srv/photo/365_2012/this_month/296_Jun_21/t$ 

Though I'd suggest changing 

for FiLe in *; do
  to 
for FiLe in $@; do

and then you'd run the script with arguments about what you really want to change, for example:

  ./tsh *JPG

It was not the easiest thing I have ever set up but you could test it by
yanking the power cord out the back and then watch the failover partner
come up automatically  with in a couple of seconds and take up where it
left off without data loss. You might want to look into this to ensure a
more resilient master.

Paul,

   I saw the purpose of the -i option on the man page and wondered why it was
in the script.

One nice thing about "legacy" is that it is often the most portable.

it would try to, except that -i would cause it to prompt you before
overwriting, as paul pointed out.

negative - it does not display the _results_ of the mv command. it displays
the mv command itself. this is to give you the opportunity to spot-check
the intended behavior before clobbering any files. the idea being that if
it looks like what you want, you remove the echo and do it again.

of course, more elegant solutions have been posted so this is all academic
at this point.

Sophisticated questions and answers.   Perhaps someone can point
me at a not-too-complicated tutorial which quickly summarizes
what is simpler and harder to do with mysql backup/mirroring.

I'm using an app that uses mysql, and I know too little about
mysql for safety.  Especially backup and mirroring.  But wuth
way too much to do, I don't have time to become an expert.

I'm guessing mysql is getting 20 reads and 5 writes per minute
during office hours, with zero user load between midnight and 6AM.

At minimum, I want to do the right thing to image the database to
backups at 3 AM.  I rsync them to two different backup servers, but
I don't know that the databases will recover to a viable state.  
Is there something I should be doing to freeze the database?

At maximum, I would like to do realtime imaging to a failover
server on a different network far far away.  About 100kbps between
a couple of lightly loaded machines with solid state drives.
In the rare event that I lose the primary server, I expect to 
lose some recent activity, and spend an hour or two recovering.

What's reasonable to expect from a maintainable-by-dummies backup
and/or failover process for mysql?

Keith

mysqldump dumps out the database contents as sql statements that can 
be loaded into another database (not just mysql), it does the whole data
base at once
though you can use diff to make it incremental, you can also enable
binary logs to make
incremental backups(though I would still do regular full dumps)

mysqldump would get you reliable backups with little effort and it would
be quick
to get up and running
 
In fact you should do at least one asap

mysqldump -u root -ptmppassword database_name > database.sql (single
database) 

mysqldump -u root -ptmppassword --all-databases > all-database.sql

> and/or failover process for mysql?
given the load a master /slave setup would be fine for your purposes and
it is
possible to do it remotely /asynchronously.

Here's some pointers 
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication.html
(I'm a little rusty on the details since its a while since I've had to
set it up
but it wasn't too hard)

Message-ID: <51C65557.1020403@bbimedia.com>

I just wanted to let PLUG subscriber know that the Open Source Bridge 
last week was awesome and highly recommend. Many sessions covering many 
day including an ad hoc Friday set. The food my the best of any 
conference and drew from Portland food carts/caterers. The price was 
right at $300 for all four days including the food and 8 hours of 
volunteer work got your in for free. For the next 30 days you can sign 
up for next year for only $150.

The most surprising thing to me was how nice, friendly and helpful 
everyone was. I hadn't put together that people interested in open 
source would understand and embody the principles that by working 
together we can build and fix the things we need an make a better world. 
At some point here will be videos of all the main session available on 
the Open Source Bridge

The $150 "ridiculously early bird registration" actually ends on June 30th;
easy to get confused since it was only announced verbally.

That sounds like a different "rename" command than the one I'm
familiar with.  The version on my systems produces the following
usage message:

  $ rename
  Usage: rename [-v] [-n] [-f] perlexpr [filenames]

Its manpage shows that it was originally written by Larry Wall (father
of Perl).  A Web search indicates that there is, indeed, more than one
"rename" command out there:

BTDT. Also a PITA, but at least there's less machines. The "best practice"
I got from the MySQL AB folks was HALinux+DRBD, so there's only *one* live
master, and both are close to each other (within milliseconds).

I think Paul's "rename" command is a little Perl script cooked up by Wall 
eons ago and scattered across the Internet since then; sometime later 
several Linux distributions started adding a small binary file, which 
sounds like the one that Rich found on his system.

   Yep:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ rename
call: rename from to files...

   The rename command is part of the util-linux-ng package and is available
from ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/."

If you are sure about the zero users between midnight and 6AM, then
you have a lot of options.  From easy to more challenging:

1) stop mysql and rsync /var/lib/mysql
2) run a mysql dump (e.g. apt-cache search automysqlbackup)
3) create slave replica and run backups from the slave
4) stop mysql, create an LVM snaphot, start mysql, rsync from snapshot

The key in each case, though, is that you need to verify that you can
restore.  It won't matter what method you choose or how good you
believe your backup to be, if you can't restore.

We do this kind of stuff regularly for all kinds of clients.  If you
want to off-load some of the heavy lifting, shoot me an e-mail
off-line.

Subject: [PLUG] July 11th (!) meeting pre-announcement
Message-ID: <51CCE17D.7050508@ambidexter.com>


Hello all,

ld:dr : THE JULY 4TH MEETING IS MOVE TO JULY 11TH IN THE USUAL TIME AND 
LOCATION AND THE TOPIC IS PHYSICAL SECURITY

With the first Thursday meeting falling the 4th, the consensus at the 
June meeting was to move the meeting up a week if the room is available.

Good news, the room is available and Steve Pasco is scheduled to give a 
talk on many aspects of physical security. I will post the full 
description soon.

Have a safe 4th!*

Michael Dexter

* There have been rather significant, borderline arson fireworks-related 
fires in my neighborhood this last two years. I do mean have a SAVE 4th 
and in the spirit of physical security, you should add "don't set 
yourself or your neighbors on fire" to your list of best practices.

Pay no attention to that man behind the flat screen.

I'm switching e-mail addresses and am confirming all is well.

It's way complicated, and I know little about it. I wish I knew more.
Is anyone here an expert? A talk at one of our meetings would be
awesome. I could help with writing systems, of which I have some ken.
