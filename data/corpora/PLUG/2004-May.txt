Silly, YOU'RE logged into the system!

And anyway, my workstations all run display managers (gdm for me) that
ensure X is running most of the time the system is up.

There's no X installed on the servers, though.  That's just dumb.

McBride seems to be stating simply the goal of the Free Software
Foundation and it's a fairly accurate depiction of one of that
organization's goals.  I fully support that goal, by the way.

Huh?!?  To which question is your resounding "no" the answer?

"Is that $229 billion in software still going to be there?"
"no"

Logically, this would have to be what you meant, but then you go on to
write about software profiteers as though they are the future rather than
relics of the past that will eventually fade away.  So it's totally
contradictory.

"Is proprietary software going to go away?"
"no"

This can't be what you mean because you write "whether the software is
proprietary or sold under the GPL".  Software distributed under the GPL
(by trade or share) is in no way proprietary.

UML seems to have filled that niche pretty nicely, I'd say.  Other systems
will surely be developing compatible user mode equivalencies and VMware
will go out of business.  Hope you don't depend on the software for
anything critical else you might get stuck with a piece of software that
is unmaintained and unmaintainable.

Well, no, but how many copies are you going to sell when the folks who buy
it can and will simply put it on their website/DAV/P2P system and share it
freely?

There is no value in information already recorded.  The value is in
recording new information.  (I use this loosely to also encompass the
re-ordering of existing information in non-trivial ways.)  Once it is
recorded, it can be shared freely and all can benefit from it.  People
will be paid for producing new work (mostly via modifications of existing
work, of course) and providing services rather than simply redistributing
bits.  We've got a nice bit distribution system and it doesn't need to be
artificially restricted to promote an archaic business model.

Wow.  The word is "facetious".  You got the first and last two letters

Well, how many times would you be able to understand each sentence without
re-reading it half a dozen times?  If you know that he's being rude, he's
expressing himself quite well because you were able to understand both his
message and something of his tone and intent.  With your posts, many times
I have a very hard time determining the message at all.

Now, while you are just going to dismiss this is as rudeness (if you even
read this post at all), I think you would do well to ponder Mike's
relevant and interesting question (which I'll paraphrase): If you can't
understand and apply the mechanics you were taught in English class, how
are you going to learn anything in a Linux or Cisco cert course?

Huh?!?  Rob's not much older than you are.  Hell, he might not be older
than you at all if, as your academics seem to imply, you spent six or
seven years in high school before attending PSU.

  My fiancee's laptop comes up in kdm (which allows non-root shutdown when
she's finished). My notebooks and all workstations/servers come up at the
commandline. When I want X running I start it with 'startx'.

  Unless the box does double duty as a workstation.

Since the nVidia drivers are binary add-ons, the process will be
different for getting the VIA SATA drivers going, AFAIK, there is no way
to compile the SATA drivers without recompiling the entire kernel.  The
more knowledge you can gather about your hardware, the easier the
configuration will be.

Although not really directly applicable, this reminded me of an

It's a nice fantasy, but not particularly realistic.

While it may or may not apply specifically to VMware, as long as software
is patentable there will be proprietary software for which there will
not be a quality OSS alternative. And before you go quoting jpeg vs png
and ogg vorbis vs mpeg, note that I did not say ALL patented software.

And even when there aren't patent issues Open Source Software has to
compete on quality, where it often fails. OSS development only works
if there are interested developers. A lot of OSS projects reach a
stage of minimal functionality and then development stops, mostly
because the few developers involved lost interest or don't have the
time to make the project a priority. Unless there's a business model
based on the application there's no guarantee of any support or specific
development plans. If I were a business that depended on the continued
development and support of a specific project I don't know that I'd want 
to bet my future on that development model. When an OSS application
becomes unmaintained it's true that it's still maintainable since the
source is available. But the cost of paying for even one developer to do 
that is significantly more than the cost of the license I'd have to pay 
for a commercial/proprietary product.

And finally, there's marketing. I learned a long time ago that a bad
product with good marketing will be more successful than a good product
with bad marketing, even when that good product is close to free.

So yes, there will always be proprietary software.

So you're saying there's really no point in any of these distributions
existing? Interesting, since without them Linux wouldn't be enjoying 
it's current increase in popularity.

I have been off the air since last Friday Night with one username. 
Email just stopped coming.  What a pleasure.  But now I want to read my
email.  Here's what I see, now. 

I have two accounts at home (why not? I am the admin).  My old standby:
mine.  My other account, other.  I have my mail forwarded from my ISP
via a ./.forward file to my email address at home.  I have an MX entry
for my home system, that works.  I am receiving email via my other
account.  My wife is receiving her email also through this home mail
server.  My mine account is not receiving mail.  I receives the same 2
emails and evolution does not delete them. 

Evolution receiving email account setup is: 
Local delivery 
Path: /var/spool/mail/mine

Does Evolution have some limit?

They're not always faked.  Since I use very few sites where my email 
address is
exposed, that raises the probability that's it's someone from here.

With all due respect Brelin, I started with a very clear question.  
Rasmussen
and AthlonRob took it way out from where it needed to go.  Fortunately,
someone did answer it.  In your classic style, I can see that you're 
keeping
this pathetic chastisement of my English skills going long after this 
thread
has any shred of topicality left.  How many days has it been since anything
useful got posted that can answer the original question?

No matter, the people who wanted to answer my question have.  So what
if those who didn't want to criticized my English instead.

I'll improve management of random email soon enough.  I can trust the email
addresses of the people I need to talk to considering that I'll still 
filter the mail
I accept.  If privacy is a concern, you encrypt and sign your message 
instead
of forging the source anyways.  If this is a list where it's important 
to be
anonymous, just how safe and useful is it?  If you want to discourage
Linux use, just host a hostile email list in the local community and attract
lots of people to it.

Are you sure Evolution is the problem? What are you using for an MTA -
sendmail, postfix, qmail? What do the log files say?

Thank you.  What are the best Linux lists?   I want to avoid
further rants against my writing, etc., like this most recent one
in the Cisco thread.

I did a search on Linux user group and choosing  Oregon
found five, of which this is one of them.  I think there's a
special procedure for getting on bizniz.  I don't know about
the Linux mailing lists for the other regions in the state, they
all seem to be for Western Oregon which is probably part
of what my problem is.  If a mailing list were hosted in Eastern
Oregon, I bet I wouldn't be having anywhere near as much
trouble as I am.

What research has been done on how much Linux mailing lists
are used and how important they are verses alternative methods
of learning about Linux including: newsgroups, books,
courses, etc?  Is there a good Linux mailing list review to help me
find one that is going to be better for me?  Do I need to use news
groups?  I tried IRC, but I didn't get a definitive sense on whether
or not it is more useful than email lists.

An aside, the behavior of Mike Rasmussen, Jeme Brelin, Athlon
Rob, and others who decide to behave similarly would probably
make for an interesting psychological study.  By and large, do
people forget common decency in email and on the telephone?  
Some studies suggest a significant number of people don't get it
when they're on the phone even in large public crowds that
everyone around them hears the conversation.
  
Apparently, there is a failure to realize that the phone and email are
by and large as public as strolling through a residential neighborhood
shouting out loud.  There are reasons to seek Linux connections in
your local vicinity, especially if you want to be part of getting Linux
adopted locally.  I don't want to make the mistake of being
stopped by local discrimination and petty bickering.

I truly hope that noone extends the Cisco rants any further.

So, intelligence and education are just a matter of number of years in 
high school
now.  How quaint.  My academics are quite solid actually.  I know 
professionals
who have done less adding little more than a Cisco certification and an IT
business degree to start a career.  PSU is a problem, the computer 
science program
there has major resource issues including lack or affective counseling 
to help
students determine the right technology degree and lack of affective career
placement throughout the program.  A lot of students abandon CS because
they can't get help or they become discouraged by the hostile teahing
environment at PSU.

Never mind that intelligence is a relation of many things many of which are
not easily measured.  Disregard that knowledge and intelligence are seperate
and distinct things.  Have you considered that prejudice is wrong and that
you sir are heavily prejudiced?  Whoever AthlonRob is, I could care less
if he is smarter than me or not.

You know I don't care for your posts.  Why, if you know they're not liked,
do you persist in harassing me every time I post on plug?  You really
need to reevaluate your priorities.  I asked about certification
and even that had to turn into a rant.  Cisco is a germane topic for Linux
administrators who, gasp, may have to either work with Cisco hardware or
emulte it.  A lot of people use Cisco equipment to get on the Internet.

For the good of the Linux community, I'm kindly asking you to leave.  
Go somewhere else or learn to judge people on how they act towards
others instead of on how intelligent they are.  Not only that, learn to
keep your judgements to yourself.

It may be unrelated, but I've found mbox files start acting funky at

If by "realistic" you mean "the way things are today", you're right... but
that's a very narrow view.

There is an old guard standing watch over the systems of the past that
have led to the creation and maintenance of the "powers that be".  Some
are direct benefactors and wielders of that power and others are merely
"conservative" and don't know how to look to something better.  Through
methodic subversion and the occassional outright rebellion, we can push
those powers aside and develop new systems that are as nice as our
fantasies.

There are surely problems with patent law!  However, when administered at
all (actual review of patent applications for non-obviousness and prior
art), it's difficult to see how a patent would cover code that couldn't be
simulated without violating the patent.

Your examples are quite fine.  It's an interesting tactic to give the
counter-argument and then dismiss it out of hand.  Is that something like
a pre-emptive strike?

There are some applications for which there is no clear Free equivalent,
sure, but there are capabilities in Free Software that are just not part
of the design considerations in the proprietary software world.

While one could say that, say, sodipodi doesn't do half of what
Illustrator does, you could also argue that Illustrator isn't nearly as
scriptable nor are its data files nearly as configurable or flexible in
their interface with other programs.

The GNU project got the ball rolling with writing Free replacement
software for existing proprietary applications and utilities.  Free
Software has progressed to include more than just duplicating the
proprietary software functionality, but evolving new kinds of applications
and systems that do things "the unix way".

So there are certain applications that can be compared
feature-for-feature, but so long as you use the proprietary work as the
standard, the Free Software will fall short.  A comparison in the other
direction will have the opposite result.  They are different beasts.

This is true of all kinds of human endeavor... not just "OSS projects".

Just because there's a business model based on the application doesn't
mean there's a guarantee of any support or specific development plans.

The smart money, of course, doesn't bet the future on a business that
depends on the continued development and support of a specific project.
Flexibility is key.

Don't look for the solution that depends on the piece of software that is
most likely to be around in ten years.  Look for the solution that doesn't
depend on any particular piece of software and allows for drop-in
replacements or easy re-engineering.

Well, this would be true if you had to pay developers for every single
software product you run, but that's just not the case.  For most
computer-dependent mid-to-large-sized businesses, the cost of software
licensing and support is more than the cost of a developer or two.

When I worked at ELI, members of my team were specifically told to spend
time enhancing a few of the key Free Software and merely open source tools
that we used and contribute back to the community.  Other tools, we used
in their mainstream development branches and didn't modify at all.  The
network of companies hiring developers to enhance different products made
for a large group of programmers working on the complete set of tools for
less money than licensing a proprietary replacement set for each company.

Yeah, what we call "marketting" today is what Adam Smith called a "market
flaw" in 1790.  There are lots of ways to make it difficult for people to
make informed decisions.  So long as there is power to be gained from
exploiting other people, a few will continue to attempt exploitation.
That's just one more damned good reason to get rid of the exploitation and
the power by eliminating proprietary software once and for all time.

I have no idea how you read that into what I wrote.  I just wrote that, as
the pipes get bigger and the connectivity gets wider, there will be less
and less interest in plopping down cash for mere distribution of
information.  The vendors MUST include some added value that is
demonstrably worth the price alone.  Hence, the software that they produce
will merely be a tool for ensnaring more customers to the services that
have real value.  In other words, they won't be selling software anymore.

Again with the narrow view.  This is a transitional phase and it is surely
going to give rise to transitional (hybrid) organizations.  But we are
already seeing the distribution business disintegrate and the services
business come to the fore in these organizations.  RHI's recent change in
development and distribution model is a good example of the transition in
action (though it's pretty clearly a dead-end model that is only
attracting some of the former Red Hat and rpm-based distribution customers
looking to keep up to date and nobody else -- Gentoo and Debian have the
fastest growing share and I don't think it's coincidence that they are not
associated with proprietary development and for-trade distribution).

This is a question for you Linux Parents out there, and for you young
guys who can remember what it was like to get on the Internet at 14.

I just set up a 14yo godson with a dialin to my computer.  He is on a
Xandros/Debian box, and the dialin is behind my firewall;  I am not too
worried about him inadvertently unleashing a virus or breaking security.
He is probably not going to be a True Hacker (but he already has 
figured out how to pull screen backgrounds off windoze games disks,
not bad for 2 weeks on Linux).

My main concern is that I have given him a capability and a
responsibility that his single mother will have to manage.  They have
a single telephone line.  I instructed him in how to use modem access
responsibly, and he is a well-behaved and thoughtful young fellow.
However, he did just get the keys to the candy store and he could
fall into bad habits, or long phone usage could create a source of
friction with his mom (who is kind but not computer savvy, and
certainly can't afford $650/yr for cable modem). 

So, parents, what works for you?  Recent ex-teens, what worked for
you?  What can I tell him and his mom that will help them work through
this potential source of friction and make it positive?  Am I fretting
too much?

What about free wireless Internet access from the nearest unprotected
access point?  Heh...  Juuuuuuusssssst kiddin'.  At least then there
wouldn't be any friction with mom over the use of the phone line.  ;-)

The amusing thing about Windows XP is that you can turn on your computer
after adding a wireless NIC and it will automatically lock on to the
strongest signal, which may or may not be your own wireless access point.
I wonder how many Windows users are actually using their neighbor's
bandwidth without even realizing it.

Ease some of the burden of modem use by getting something like
catch-a-call.  At least that way, calls will get through.  The other way
is to get the phone company to answer your messages.

Message-ID: <408F0F0A.2020406@pacificscreening.com>

I'm working with a large volume of data that's closing in on 20 GB that 
I'd like to back-up bi-annually to multiple CD-R(W)s.  I'm familiar with 
Hugo Rabson's powerful Mondo Rescue (http://www.microwerks.net/~hugo/) 
but in my particular environment (FreeBSD) it seems to be a real push to 
configure the prerequisite packages into FreeBSD.

Tar and gzip do the job just fine but with the large amount of data and 
the comparatively small amount of burnable space it seems I need to do a 
fair amount of checking directory size and subsequently compressed 
archive size prior to burning to be sure that I'm not over-extending the 
recordable CD.

Is there a more scriptable way to do this?  I suspect tar, gzip, and 
split (as one pipe) may be a possibility, but I'm unfamiliar with split.

I'm hoping someone has had the same experience and worked towards a 
solution.

Thanks!

I dont know if its any help but I have had experience installing RH9, fedora 
1, knoppix and gentoo on my Inspiron 5100 (yes I am an install junkie).  RH9 
was awful and I never did get it quite working right, I belive I got acpi 
working using a 2.4.24 kernel from kernel .org, but never got the patches for 
the redhat kernel to work.  Fedora was a bit better, ACPI was already patched 
in the kernel, getting OpenGL and DRI working was easier but still not great.  
Knoppix ran everything out of the box perfectly, I really enjoyed using it, 
but then I discovered gentoo.  Gentoo is probably my favorite distro I have 
used so far, if you are brave enough to conquer the install (The knowledge 
you will gain is invaluable though) everything works out of the box, the 
documentation on their web site is very thorough, plus I dont have to worry 
about dependency problems anymore (gentoo takes care of that for you).

This may still be out of the ball park price-wise, since it sounds
like their dailup is free at the moment, but anyway.  A(pologies if
this sounds a lot like an add.. I don't work for any ISP, I've just
been really happy with unicom).

Unicom (uci.net) offers DSL+phone+longdistance, starting at $38/month
total. (this includes isp and line charges, although I don't know if
it includes taxes.)  based on my phonebill with quest, that makes dsl
run about $15/month.

On dial-up, I know there are some services that provide
values based access.  PAX comes to mind.  The scariest
thought about a single mother putting a 14 year old on the
net is how much affect some of the predatory stuff one
runs into will have on a teen.  I guess my advice would
 be caution if the mother is not aware of what the net is
these days and perhaps some faith based advice for both
of them.  There are problems with sheltering anyone,
but a teenager is especially vulnerable to the net's darker
corners.  The best defense I guess is to teach proactively
and filter while including the teen and mother in that
somehow.

At 14, I wonder if this person is mature enough to be
capable of making the right decisions when
 confronted with a darker corner of the net?  Will the
mother be allowing net use when she isn't able to
monitor it?  The other problem with teenagers is that
they think they're adults, but even in your twenties
sometimes you're still stupid.  

I think most people with DSL or Cable have as their
primary complaint that the net delivers arousal
and gratifcation well, but falls far short in most cases
 of giving what it is really desired, wanted, or even
needed.  It's annoying that the net is such a lawless
and filthy frontier in so mnay parts.  If he has email
access through you, I recommend filtering it so that
he doesn't see Cialis, etc., ads.  You're providing the
connection, don't be afraid to do so in a way that fits
with your values.  I guess the only advice is to make
the teenager part of your values based decisions
because a teen, while he/she won't say it, wants to
learn about adulthood from a trusted source.  Most
teens want protection still as they're just starting to
learn what it means to be an adult and  beginning
to assume more responsibility for themselves,
but they want to feel independent too.  It's a hard
time.

I'm surprised DSL is so expensive, in many places
now you can get it for just $20 a month.  That might
be misleading though if you have to get a static ip,
etc.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0405022207180.5545@mercury.walstr.org>

I have a 17" flat screen CRT monitor, barely a year old, that has lost
its vertical control.  I've sent it back to the manufacturer to be
repaired once, but two months after the repair, the vertical is shot
again.  

I could send it back to the manufacturer once again, but I've not been
satisfied by either the turnaround time for the repair or the quality
of the repair itself.  I'm considering taking it to a local shop that
could do the repair at my own expense, so that I can at least
speak face to face with somebody who actually might be able to fix it.
Have any of you found such a business that you would enthusiastically
recommend?

Thanks in advance -

I believe you have to had the free space to build the initial tarball then 
the space to split it into.  (I has been quite awhile since I last used 
split.)

An non-free solution might be BRU.

If the same problem cropped up, I'd try to get the manafacturer to 
replace it rather than just try a repair.  If you start playing 
hardball, most companies will rather keep you happy than risk you 
telling other potential customers that they're monitors are junk.

Rod,

  I was going to suggest a tape solution, too, but thought the desire was
strictly to write to a cd-rw. FWIW, I've been using BRU for seven years now
and both the software and occasional support have been outstanding. On the
hardware side I finally settled on a Tandberg SLR-60 drive and it has worked
flawlessly the past three years. About every 8 months it asks to be cleaned;
otherwise it just works.

  Monday-Thursday nights are daily, incremental backups; Friday night is a
full backup of all servers/workstations. Very convenient, very secure, very
comforting.

While it may indeed be the monitor, you should also try replacing the
video cable and VGA board that drives the monitor.  You would get the
same effect (no vertical synchronization, slowly rolling video) if either
of those were intermittent, or the connectors were making bad contact,
so that pin 14 (vertical sync) was not always connected.  

The most likely thing that would fail in the monitor yielding this
symptom is the HD-15 connector, or the circuit board trace connecting
it to the video sync chip, or the video sync chip in the monitor.  I
would guess bad strain relief on the monitor's connector - the cable
puts a lot of leverage on the connector, and the flexing and pressure
probably breaks connections on the circuit board.  This may be a usage
issue rather than a monitor replacement issue.  Make sure there is no
undue pressure on the monitor connector, or the system will break again.

If cable swapping and video board swapping doesn't fix the problem,
it might be an idea to send one or both along with the monitor next
time you send it in for repair, to quell a "somebody else's problem"
attitude on the part of the repair technician.

It sucks that with all the zillions of transistors that go into a
video board and monitor these days, they cannot put in a few thousand
extra to verify the integrity of the video path.  Sadly though, in a
few years we will likely get that "integrity check" in the form of
some "Digital Rights Management" Linux lockout on the video path.

XP will detect available networks, but XP *will not* connect to a
WEP-less WiFi network until you specifically allow it and *does* keep
tabs on previously used networks, giving them priority for connection. 

IMO, XP's pushing WEP so hard is really annoying... but it's the
*opposite* of their more typical networking promiscuity.

Very close to none, I'd wager.

Perhaps some have inadvertently connected to the wrong "Linksys" network
or failed to realize that they flubbed their WAP setup.  But it's
doubtful.  The standard CD-driven cable-based installation process makes
such problems virtually impossible.

As for *intentional* piggybacking, that's another thing entirely... :-)

FWIW,

Dylan

<soapbox=1>

At the risk of missing an important reason to use CD-R disks, may I 
suggest you look at  http://www.keithl.com/linuxbackup.html ?  The
disk-to-disk RSYNC backup techniques are fully portable to BSD and
other forms of Unix. 

Bi-annual backups are risky - chances are, when the source disk fails,
you will have an average of 3 months of data entry lost.  Scary.

More importantly, writable CDs fail frequently and are expensive; I
see about 5% failure-to-verify on the "good" brands of media (I like
Fuji and Memorex), and 10-15% on "bad" brands (Imation, Dysan, Verbatim,
TDK, store-brand-du-jour).  So 20GB -> 30 media, thus you can expect to
see about 2 fails per backup pass (and your back software had better
handle this gracefully).  Given that CD-R media can also fail on the
shelf (it is not an archival process)  you will need to make at least
two interchangeable sets of disks if you want some chance of ever
reading back those data sets at a later time.   At 5 minutes per disk,
including verify and labelling and replacement of fails, that sounds
like a whole day of work.

I could ramble on - but I strongly suggest you do disk-to-disk backup
instead, and pick a scheme (my webpage mentions many) that matches
your data set.  Redundant backup of 20GB can be done on two 80GB
backup disks, with very little per-backup work once the system is
set up.  The biggest source of backup/restore failure is the failure
to do the backup;  a day per backup onto CDs sounds like a highly
put-off-able task.

Interestingly enough I've backed to other non-tape media using BRU.  
I've done it to a hard drive partition and floppies.  I seem to remember 
BRU had added support for 'other' media as in CDs.
   I've gotten (and been forced - Windows environment) away from using BRU 
so couldn't say off the top of my head if the CD-RW are actually  
supported but it is worth checking.
   This could handle Keith's concerns as BRU does a lot of testing before
is will write and if there is an error the verify will place it in the log
- of which you're familiar I'm sure.  The up side was even with some bad
data BRU could recover a lot of it.  On the down side it uses a
proprietary format.

I started about 7 years ago myself.  I even got so cozy with them (worked
for an authorized dealer) I got one of the really neat coffee mugs made
from a canning jar.  The most difficult task was getting the users on
site to remember to change tapes daily and weekly.

Backing up that amount of data onto such small media will be a headache.
Some of the issues:
  + media swapping
  + media errors during backup
  + media errors after backup
  + loss/damage to one portion of the backup
  + partial restore
  + frequency of backups
  + verify backup

Media swapping
--------------

It may not seem like a big deal, but it is very tedious to swap, label,
and store huge numbers of disks for one backup.  Ask anyone who survived
50-floppy backups in the Bad Old Days.  ;-)

Media errors during backup
--------------------------

Does your backup method allow you to retry a particular segment of the
backup in the event of write errors, or must you start all over from the
beginning?  Murphy's Law would have the backup fail partway through the
last disk and make you start over again.  :-(

Media errors after backup
-------------------------

What happens if disk 12 of 40 is bad?  Can this error be ignored?  Will
the rest of the backup be restore-able or does the software choke on the
whole thing?

Loss/damage to one portion of the backup
----------------------------------------

Similar to the above, but what if the whole disk is missing?

Partial restore
---------------

If you only need one file, must you read the whole set of disks to restore
it?  (tar is notorious for this.)

Frequency of backups
--------------------

Twice a year?  Would you even WANT to restore data that old?  I can see
only doing a full backup this often, but what about much smaller
incremental backups?

Verify backup
-------------

Ideally you'd be able to read the entire backup and compare each file with
the one on the current filesystem to make sure the disks were written
correctly and can still be read.

Before embarking on this, you should borrow a copy of the O'Reilly UNIX
Backup and Recovery book: http://safari.oreilly.com/1565926420.  The
chapter "Freely Available Filesystem Backup & Recovery Utilities" was very
helpful for me.

When I had to do something similar to you (not as bad, only 6 GB of data)
I settled on using "dump" since it filled the disks, allowed for easy
single-file recoveries, has a nice built-in method for continuing the
backups as incrementals, and didn't require me to read the whole damn
thing when restoring.

The main drawbacks were lack of portability (ext2 only), and the confusing
syntax of dump.

Make 2 copies and stuff one in a safe deposit somewhere.  You'll be glad
you did when the backing peels off the cheap CD-Rs on your first copy.
;-)

Dear All:

Sorry for being off topic but since I get so many helpful
advices on linux stuff here at this forum so I thought I post
this one too.

I am looking to register a website and need hosting service.  Did some 
digging
around the web and I found this company:

    http://www.whnhosting.com/

Looks like they are up in Alaska.  Their prices are about the
cheapest that I can find.  So cheap that I am not sure if I should be wary
since low price does not mean good/reliable service.

Can someone offer some tips/advices on what I should watchout
when choosing a hosting service?  This is a merchant account website
so reliability is a must.

Thanks!

I need to find an example for a quick test to see if a bug has been fixed.

I need a small snippet of Java (1.4.2) code that will

1) List available printers

2) Let me select one that is not the default printer.

3) Print something to that printer.

I am trying to get a program working in OS X.  The class library docs are 
less than clear on this issue.  java.awt.print seems to be the correct 
method, but the implementation seems less than useful.

If this works in Linux and not OS X I will just see about porting it.

Alan,

  Can you use swing rather than awt? The latter was the first attempt and is
quite poor. "Swing" is the much improved widget set for java.

I will check.  Not certain how well it is supported in OS X.  (Or Linux, 
for that matter...)

Maybe I should write more java code...

I think that is the javax.printing classes.  Those are broken on the Mac

  It should work with any jdk-2. At least, that's my understanding. The
O'Reilly book on Swing is huge. There's a lot to it.

The other big issue in doing backups to cd-r are the problems of
preserving filenames and permissions.

If you have filenames that are longer than about 131 characters, they
will get truncated.  

If you have filenames that contain non-english character sets that have
not been translated to utf-8, they will not always go on the disc.

If you have file attributes beyond the basic permissions, then they will
probably forgotten.  (Such as extended attributes or posix security
permissions like what SELinux uses.)

I am not certain how much of the above gets preserved by tar or cpio. 
(Especially extended permission bits and odd acls.)

I once thought dvd backups were all I needed.  Now I have my doubts.

If he has local access to the net, there is no reason for him to rack up
long distance.  The porn dialer trojans need Windows to operate.

If you are worried about him getting to porn, there is *nothing* you can
do.

Period.

Wanting to learn about sex is a part of growing up.  (No matter what the
"moralists" will say.)  Seeing sexual images is not harmful to kids that
age, unless they have been previously traumatized by their parents.

What you need to worry about is what friends they make on the net.  He
needs to know that not everyone on the net is what they claim.

Every 14 year old girl on the net is actually a 40 year old cop looking
for a promotion.

There are some pretty desperate and whacked people on the net. 
(Especially in chat rooms and IRC.)  He needs to know this.  He also
needs to know that there are some people who get off by pushing other
people's buttons.

Teach him how to not feed the trolls.

The censorbot software actually makes people comfortable in cases where
they should not.  It blocks things that are relatively harmless (Usually
sex, but also other things that make so-called adults uncomfortable) and
does not block the real threat -- people who want to use you, abuse you,
imprison and/or kill you.  There is no real way to block those out. 
(Even if you cut off all the .gov and .mil addresses.) 

Teaching him what the real threats are will go much farther than putting
in a porn blocker.

I don't have any censor programs on my home network.  My daughter has
full access to the net.  

Net censorship is just another way to say "I don't trust you".

Message-ID: <1083647100.6304.5.camel@timmy>

This is not a cry for help, but a solution to a problem.

Earlier today, I tarred up some files, foolishly putting a '..' in front
of every filename. When I tried to untar them, it complained with this
message:

Member name contains `..'

The files were not extracted. 

After some drudging through the manpage, I discovered the solution:

       -P, --absolute-paths
              don't strip leading `/'s from file names

When I tacked this on to my command line, the files were extracted to
the parent directory. 

I'm posting this here because I was unable to find this anywhere else
and thought I might save someone else the grief.

I only vaguely described the symptoms above.  The picture began to
flicker for a few days, on and off, during which time a sharp whack to
the rear of the monitor case seemed to return it to the correct path.
After a few days, however, the vertical just threw in the towell,
leaving me with an entire screen full of picture in a bright
horizontal line in the middle of the screen.

Though I didn't change the video cable, as it was firmly attached to
the monitor, I did change video cards with no change in results.
Also, while the monitor was in the warranty return purgatory, I made
do with an older monitor I dusted off from the garage, with no
performance problem.  

Given these new facts, does this still sound like a vertical sync
problem?  I really don't know, so I'm grateful for the collective
expertise of the PLUG list.

Thanks for your help, Keith.

Hey all,

I was upgrading a system to unstable today and accidentally enabled the
"sub-pizel rendering" option that comes up for certain LCD screens.

But this was done hastily while updating a large number of packages and I
don't know which package to reconfigure to undo that mistake (or which
config file needs editting).

Help!  This looks awful!

It was fontconfig... duh.

`dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig` took care of it.

It would be nice if all that dialog got logged to a file somewhere so
that it could be grepped if necessary.

I assume this is some Windoze worm out there, assuming I am running

Well, my apologies to the list and to Wally, I was not trying to forge 
Wally's address, but rather in a tired moment was trying to compose a 
private response to Wally and apparently filled in wrong spaces and well the 
rest is history. 

For the record - I think the best solution is to get the manufacturer to 
make right.

Either someone is trying a buffer overflow attack or you have a poorly 
designed web crawler trying to digest your site.

Are they all coming from the same IP or different IPs?

What happens if you run traceroute on them?  The site could be ignoring 
ICMP packets.  Traceroute will drop shortly before if that is true.

What happens if you scan the ip with nmap?

I am not certain if there should be any concern.  I know of no buffer 
overflows in Apache. There are some other attacks that work under Linux, 
but they do not leave that sort of tracks.

Ouch.  The original spec for HTTP only used something like 256 
characters for a URL.  There are limits to what browsers and servers 
support.  It is usually much higher than 256 characters, but you're 
into the 1k range.

I think Alan might be right.  It could be a misconfigured spider or 
something.  Do all the hits tend to come from one or a small cluster 
of IPs?  Do they seem to be methodically going through your directory 
tree?  The redirection to Comcast might be confusing it, maybe???

Then again, maybe there is another vulnerability in IIS having to do 
with long URLs and you're just the current target of some script 
kiddy.

Best,
Kyle

Yes! Or even if it was on the web.  I often remember things I've heard or
read verbatim, so I could easily have found the message had it been
publicly available.

Subject: [PLUG] exim4 as ssl/tls client
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0405041157460.16903@glenfiddich.cse.ogi.edu>

At some point in the (hopefully) near future, I'll be moving my main
mail server out of my house to co-lo facility. I want all my home
machines to relay mail through that box, and I want those connections
verified via SSL-certificate checking.

So I built my own little certificate authority and generated
certs for each host on my network.

I'm pretty familiar with sendmail's m4 configuration process, so
telling local hosts running sendmail how to offer up a client
certificate was pretty easy: just add confCLIENT_CERT and
confCLIENT_KEY definitions and rebuild sendmail.cf.

Harder -- well, more obscure -- was getting exim4 to offer up a client
cert. The exim4 config file has settings for tls_certificate and
tls_privatekey, but they're only good when exim is acting as a server;
they don't apply to exim as a client.

The answer wasn't documented at all in the comments in the exim4
config stuff, nor was it in the README.TLS file. Instead, buried in
the FAQ on www.exim.org is this little gem:

  A1705:  This means that the clients have not sent certificates when
  asked by the server to do so. If the clients are running Exim, check
  that tls_certificate is correctly set in their smtp transports. Note
  that this value is not automatically inherited from the global
  tls_certificate option.

What that means in practice is that your remote_smtp transport
definition needs a bit of tweaking, e.g.,

remote_smtp:
  debug_print = "T: remote_smtp for $local_part@$domain"
  driver = smtp
  tls_certificate = CONFDIR/exim.crt

Voila!

Do you mean that it hung during the boot process?

/sbin/ifconfig will list all interfaces currently configured.

Look at /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* for the interface
configuration files. If you don't want to edit text files, the
more-or-less official configuration utility is
/usr/bin/redhat-config-network.

  Drop it?

  Try booting into single-user mode (linux single at the boot prompt). Then
read dmesg to see what went on when it hung up.

  /etc/hosts. The format is IP address <space> fully-qualified-host-name
<space> alias; e.g.,

127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost
192.168.55.1    salmo.appl-ecosys.com   salmo mail
192.168.55.2    caddis.appl-ecosys.com  caddis

Not sure, try a tail on /var/log/messages and other log files in that
directory to see if there is any useful information on the cause of the
hang.
Maybe a reboot will help.

Bzzt.  /etc/hosts is just a mapping of ip number to hostname.  That is
not where you go to assign an IP address to an interface, which is
what I gather Mike was looking for.  Nor does /etc/hosts get filled in
magically.  Essentially, it is a place to manually place mappings.

  What have I overlooked?

Looks as if Rich has the best approach for question #1. Boot to single

  Well, it ain't elegant, but I edited the bookmark file by hand
(~/.opera/opera.adr) and that did the trick. Not nearly as useful as
mozilla.

Message-ID: <20040504223820.2d9cf929.jason@vancleve.com>

I was pondering "sasser" just now, briefly, as I emailed my old man,
telling him 'Doze users running ZoneAlarm shouldn't be affected; though
I'm not absolutely certain that's true.

Anyway, assuming this sort of attack is blocked by a good firewall (yes,
and not running unneeded services, etcetera), I'm wondering if distros
like Fedora and Mandrake are installing with a default iptables
configuration of any kind.  (For, if I say Linux users are better off
for security, it isn't because their ports are nicely sealed; to the
contrary, it can be argued they are better off only because they are not
running the poopular OS.)  If I recommend the Linux on the desktop for
this reason, people might expect it to solve the firewall problem, but
does it?

It could be a simple matter of adding a startup script or something,
which is still better than installing ZoneAlarm on Winders.  But with
Gentoo I had to write my own iptables script, which is not an end user
type thing.

No, many (most?) distributions leave it up to the end user to configure
a firewall if they want one.

More than once I've been burned by RH's default firewall closing
everything off on somebody else's box.  It bugs me.  :-)

Slackware doesn't ship with a firewall, Gentoo doesn't ship with a
firewall.  There are a plethora of preconfigured firewall scripts out
there, though, if you want 'em.  Heck, I even hacked on one a friend
wrote to make it my own.  I almost rewrote it in c++ as a learning
exercise but decided that was a bit too insane - even for me.

There are various UIs and script for generating iptables scripts. Still not quite an end user type thing, but certainly a sysadmin type thing.

Redhat and Mandrake both ship with a firewall.  What gets blocked
depends on what security level you set the machine at and what services
you tell it to open up.  They tend to be better in the most recent
versions.  Most of the configuration utilities give you a list of
"standard" services and allow you to check them.  If you need something
non-standard (like nfs) you have to look up the port numbers and enter
them. (Usually in the form of port:type.  Example 443:tcp)

The hard part with Mandrake (and sometimes Redhat) is figuring out where
they put the iptables data if you need to modify it by hand.

Yeah.  Not fun having done it too many times.  There are a number of
firewall configuration scripts and programs at
http://www.freshmeat.net/.  They are a good start.  Also "Linux
Firewalls 2nd edition" is very useful for good information on writing
rulesets.  Just make sure you get the errata.

Yes, I guess I did mean Thursday, May 6, 2004 at 19:00.
Damn Linux (and Emacs).
I wouldn't have made this error with Windows!!

David,

  It gets more difficult to get a data as we get older. Don't worry about

I booted in single mode and got the following strings at the freeze point:

I was going to say, the singular form of "data" is "datum". ;-)

Interesting.  Thanks.  I just managed to rsync from two different
sources:

  rsync://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/knoppix/KNOPPIX_V3.4-2004-05-04-EN.iso

  rsync://ftp.iasi.roedu.net/mirrors/knopper.net/knoppix/KNOPPIX_V3.4-2004-05-04-EN.iso

And got the same md5sum (8e9cd4d310ad8381d1ec3326c6caae2b) from both.
I'd be interested in discovering what the differences are.

Perhaps the difference is that the others work and yours doesn't?

The ARIN website has the blocks, but not the whois info (as far as I could
find), but that can be scripted:

ftp://ftp.arin.net/pub/stats/

APNIC has the whois data available for that region available for download:

ftp://ftp.apnic.net/pub/whois-data/APNIC/

Mike,

What the others are not saying is that your primary partition / could
not be found by the kernel.  Since it could not find the file system the
kernel paniced.  Paul suggested you do another install.  You might try
booting in rescue mode:  linux rescue.  Check your lilo/grub
configuration for where it should find the root filesystem.

aaron,

  Are you looking for a date? More to the point, the monthly clinic? That'll
be Saturday, 15 May. The focus will be in WiFi, but others may find a free
moment, too.

No, after rsync'ing (which, of course, starting with the broken copy,
just patches the bad parts) it *does* work.  It was the initial http
copy that didn't work, presumably because it was damaged somehow.

If someone else has the other md5sum, maybe you can bring a copy to
the meeting tomorrow and I can cmp them or vice versa.

I thought it was really cool when I setup a Win2k Primary Domain
Controller, a Win2k Secondary Domain Controller and a Win2k SourceSafe
Server all on the same Linux box running at the same time.  Being able
to remotely reset a wedged Win Server was the ultimate.  Too bad I
couldn't convince my old boss to buy into it, he decided to shell out
for the hardware instead (which actually contributed to my job
security).

Too bad I can't make the meeting.

Have fun,

There may be other things, but KDM needs to be running and restarted
after the change to the config file.

You can test locally (removing the possibility of a problem on the
client end) like this:

X :1 -query localhost

If that works and the remote machine doesn't, then maybe KDM is only
listening on 127.0.0.1.

As far as your webmail goes, I really like and highly recommend Ilohamail.
It's small, lightweight, fast, and free. Plus it allows login to external
mail servers if you so choose to allow.

http://ilohamail.org/

As far as email server software, I use Exim. Ilohamail works with any pop3
or imap compatible server.

Exim is an SMTP server, not an IMAP or POP3 server. I use uw-imapd, but
I can't say I recommend it. It's completely unconfigurable, but it works
for me.

I use http://www.squirrelmail.org/ for my webmail (highly recommended!),
but I'll take a look at ilohamail.

SMTP:  Postfix
IMAP:  bincimap
WebMail:  SquirrelMail

Then toss SpamAssassin in there for spam filtering.  If you have any
Windows boxes at all that might be reading email from the server or
sending email through the server, I'd highly recommend installing
AMaViSd-new and configuring it to utilize SA and ClamAV.

Aha, that's what I was after.  So if a 'Doze user wants to defect on

should be good options.  Is fedora like Redhat in this regard?

Of course, there are firewall utilities available in the Debian archive
(and I assume Gentoo).  Several, in fact.  Some that come with presets and
some that are just configurators.

I suggest squirrelmail, but first, I suggest switching to a real OS.

Your virus checker should *NOT* be advertising itself to the outside
world.  Most, if not all, viruses sent via email today forge the From
header.  Virus companies obviously know this, but don't bother to fix
their software to try to find the correct sender.  Be aware that this
could cause *you* to send free advertising out to unrelated third
parties on behalf of your antivirus vendor.

The best method of handling this is to reject virus infected messages
at STMP time, thus avoiding needlessly bothering anyone.  Nobody wants
your virus vendor's spam, and it only wastes more of your resources to
send it.

You don't have to reject at SMTP time in order to silently ignore the
spam.

In one installation, I use the packages AthlonRob suggests along with
postfix to filter spam and virii while sending no messages out about the
spam and accepting no "virus warnings" from outside.

On the subject of the thread, I use the Courier system (IMAP and POP3
components) and SquirrelMail on that same installation for remote mail
services and webmail respectively.  SMTP-Auth is configured to read from
the same database as the Courier authentication.

It's a pretty easy setup and there are numerous good How-Tos.

Alternatively:

SMTP:    Sendmail     http://www.sendmail.org/
IMAP:    Dovecot      http://dovecot.org/
WebMail: SquirrelMail http://www.squirrelmail.org/

Configure all three to use SSL/TLS for security, and set up
spamassassin via milter-spamc:

  http://www.snert.com/Software/milter-spamc/index.shtml

If you're hosting mailboxes for Windows users and want some anti-virus
scanning, then build ClamAV with milter enabled:

Why bother accepting it if everybody using that server is guaranteed
to not want it?  Seems like it's more practical to just tell your
server to give spammers the finger and tell them to piss off than
accept their spew.

You're not giving the spammer the finger.  The spam is probably
originating from a bot on some Windows box somewhere or other automated
script that doesn't care what you have to say about the message.  A bad
SMTP return code doesn't change a thing for the bot.  They're not going to
take the address off the list just because it failed this time around.

So it doesn't matter WHEN you ignore it, so long as it doesn't interfere
with your regular course of business.

In addition to that (or in consequence of it), SMTP has timeouts and
processing each message for content BEFORE you send a return code will
take much longer than just sending an accept for all well-formed messages
to valid addresses and moving on.  If anything causes high load on the
machine, its conceivable that the SMTP will timeout before the content is
examined and you could end up rejecting valid mail (albeit temporarily).

I don't see any advantage to SMTP=time spam filtering.  After SMTP and
before delivery is handy enough.

I currently use the procmail approach but now that all of the users on the
system are using spamassassin, I'll probably go ahead and configure the
milter.

I have recently moved into a new apartment and need to have ethernet run
to a separate room that shares a wall with the room that has it. 

The previous tenant drilled a hole and fed a coax cable through the
wall. If I could find an RJ45-to-Coax (type "F"?) adapter I could just
use this.

I could go wireless or drill another hole, but I'd rather not. I checked
with fry's and found all kinds of adapters and converters but not this.
Does anyone know if such an adapter exists?

Cheers,
sasha

The only way to do this is to find an old 10mb ethernet hub with a 10base2 
connector.  Use the coax on the one connector and ethernet on the other.

Either way, you will only get 10mbit without rewiring.

There may be other things, but KDM needs to be running and restarted
after the change to the config file.

You can test locally (removing the possibility of a problem on the
client end) like this:

X :1 -query localhost

If that works and the remote machine doesn't, then maybe KDM is only
listening on 127.0.0.1.

If you can pull the coax through (ie: it's not stapled to a stud
somewhere) you should be able to use it to pull a string, then use
the string to pull an rj45 jumper.  

I imagine the converter you're looking at will rival the cost of a
WAP.  (Wouldn't such a converter require some sort of parrallel-serial
converter, and need the brains to do pulse-width modulation?)

I looked for a coax-RJ45 connector a couple of years ago and was unable to
find anything.  If you're trying to run ethernet through a cable-tv
connection, I don't know of any such solution.  It's probably easier and
cheaper to pull Cat-5 wiring through the wall using existing path of the
coax cable.

I've tried to do HORDE IMP a couple of times but had major difficulties 
with it.  A number
of people prefer squirrelmail.  My advice is to set up webmail last. 
 You want to do
postfix/qmail, spamassassin, DNS, and possibly mailscanner with ClamAV 
first.  
I've tried qmail, Postfix seems easier, Sendmail is a headache and 
insecure, don't know
about Exim.

Note the only thing I don't like about using dns ignorant under Postfix 
and Mailscanner
is that information about what I get is being sent to some unknown 
outside source.
For virus filtering, going out to an external source and getting fresh 
virus info is a good
idea.  If this happens with the email itself, be aware that someone 
outside your system
is probably getting to read it too.

Probably a good idea to chroot apache and custom compile for webmail so 
if you have trouble,
you don't lose all your work setting up the mail server itself.  

I'm getting ready to start a project that takes a completely different 
approach to spam.  Yes you
can filter it, but if you filter solely, you still get a lot of junk and 
could miss a virus, etc.

     It recognizes a few key ideas:

          1) Spam creates excess heat and ruins hard disks that host 
mail spools.

          2)  The more complex your filtering is, the easer it is to 
filter the wrong
               thing.

          3)  Most people can build a list of who they contact and are 
contacted
                by through an email address, this can be used to reduce the
                namespace that needs to be filtered for some accounts.
           
         4)   Untrusted mail needs to be handled off site or thrown away.

I'm planning on mailservers on my gateways that spool in ram and dump to
Sandisks in emergencies to address issue 1.  These mail servers are going to
be developed to selectively relay to my existing MTA.  

Issue 2 will be eased by allowing email from unknown senders to be held 
until
the source is trusted or a period of 24 hours passes .  I'm thinking, have
a website internally for the intended recipient to indicate that a 
sender is okay,
if they want.  If a person had been asked about a sender and doesn't 
trust that
sender, the message can be simply be sent to a dirty site right away.

Concerning point 3, the advantage of this is that space on the relay 
isn't being
lost to  junk mail intended for a protected account.  This approach is 
really
good if a user knows his/her audience and/or can get people to switch the
email address that they send to. So as long as the sender understands that
they have to use the trusted source address having an adequate procedure
to follow if their email address has to change, this shouldn't be a 
problem.    
  
Point 3 is an idea that I want to implement on an email address by email
address basis.  Not implementing 3 will mean following the policy for
point 2 concerning messages from untrusted sources. Implementing three
without 2 means not using email to get new email sources, but it also
means if you don't accept outside postmaster and admin mail that you don't
need a dirty mail mail site.

If I implement point 4 fully, I probably need two new servers.  One machine
would be a Linux iptables or BSD based machine implementing a one way
door for the smtp and smtps protocols.  The other machine gets to be a 
second
mailsite with locally installed MUAs on it as well,  This "dirty" site 
can't touch
the trusted network.     

I recommend that all postmaster and admin email from outside your network
be routed to a dirty mail mail site.

If the dirty mail site gets infected, something important might get 
lost.  Can
anyone comment on using user mode linux, or any other possible tricks, to
address this issue?

For Point 3 to work, you need a special list for unresolvable trusted 
hosts.  I
also recommend throwing away or sending to a dirty site any forged email
where the source domain is not either on an unresolvable but trusted 
list, or
dns server somewhere.  The best test would be a bounce check.  If you can't
bounce a message, why accept the sender or even place the message on a
dirty site?  I am against smtp authentication, apparently noone needs to 
know
the secret to thwart it since they can just copy the secret and voila, 
they've
gotten around your security filter.  It may be that a secret sent out by 
phone
or other means is the way for a sender to mark their message as being from
them.  Encryption seems to be more useful for protecting against snooping
though than unwanted senders.  Anyone can hack on encrypted email for
as long as they want.  Statistically, someone has to be interested 
considering
the sheer volume of email.  

The biggest problem today is invasion of privacy because spam houses and
spam gangs think noone is in control of threir own email boxes and because
some people answer unsolicited and invasive email.  The big thing is how
you determine accurately that an email came from someone, or something,
that /or whom you want to correspond with.  Accomplish the latter, the
race to filter content on your end will be eased considerably.  The 
other big
thing is to not miss anything that could be a virus or malicious code, I 
guess
this means figuring out if an email is just a plain text message that 
isn't a
program and for convenience sake figuring out which mime messages are
safe too.

I've tried iptables based blocking of ips.  I recommend against this 
becuase
of virtual hosting of multiple sites on the same ip and you probably want
to at least allow dns from anywhere.  Besides, if a friend gets a virus
he/she may get blocked.

You might want to spamassassin on a relay and relay marked mail to a
dirty site.  The only thing is, I don't know how to detect trustworthy html
email and/or email that is anything but clear text.

Email is a service that  you may want to go through your ISP for from the
standpoint that he gets infected and you don't.  Unfortunately, I don't know
if there are any ISP's out there that gurantee you won't get viruses from
them, etc al.  I wonder if anyone can gurantee this?

Hope this helps ;-)

Hi,

If you're interested in security, this is very cool.  These guys built a 
toolkit with most of Fydor's Top 75 Security Tools, a flexible security 
probe and a security administration package that has minimal hardware 
requirements. It's a gzipped iso that lets you burn a Red Hat 9 bootable 
security toolkit.  All the popular stuff, nessus, snort, nmap, ethereal and 
lots more,  designed for operation from the console or headless from a 
serial port or remotely through ssh or https. The project includes 
everything you need to modify the system and build your own iso with 
changes to the kernel, the packages and tools as well as customizing 
various configuration settings.  There is plenty of high quality 
documentation and it's all open source. See:

It's an interesting question. My bias is to reject it outright with an
SMTP 550 error message. That's the most standards-compliant way to do
it, and, if the sender is sending spam by mistake (fat chance, I
know), it lets him know his message didn't get delivered.

On the other hand, spambots armies now have some central coordination.
See, for example, the "Spammer zombie group behaviour" thread on the
mimedefang mailing list:

http://lists.roaringpenguin.com/pipermail/mimedefang/2004-April/022003.html

In short, if you reject a message from one spambot, others will try
to deliver the message again soon thereafter. I can see it happening
in my mail logs at home. It's sick and facinating all at the same
time.

The admin is faced with a tough question: Is it better to do things
the right way and be forced to reject the same spam many times, or to
silently discard it and make the spammer think he was successful in
delivering it, reducing the strain on the mail infrastructure.

It's a no-win choice. I choose to do it the standards-based way, but I
don't have a mail server that's already swamped dealing with thousands
of inbound tcp connections, scanning every message for spam and
viruses.

As Alan mentioned, the only feasible way to make use of the coax is to
use it as a 10Base2 segment.  It should be noted that the coax is almost
certainly the wrong impedance.  Cable TV coax is 75 ohms, whereas 10Base2
uses 50 ohm coax.  If the run is short and you use 75 ohm terminators, it
would probably work anyway.  That said, I think you would be much better
off using the coax to pull through a piece of cat5.

I'm confused.  Why, exactly, does it matter if I have an
X-Virus-Scaned-By header tacked on by my server?  Or did you mean
something else by the word 'advertising' ?  What does that have to do
with the From header?

My email server is set to silently drop anything identified as spam or
virus.  I don't see how this 'free advertising' (in the form of that
single little header *I* put in there) has any negative effect on
anybody.

Hell, it's ClamAV, it's free already.  :-)

If you reject at SMTP time, however, you must fully scan it at SMTP
time, which can drag out the SMTP connection for much longer than is
expected, causing servers to assume your system has died and error with
a 4xx.

Perhaps a two-tiered approach would be ideal.

That may be so, either way, the spam still gets rejected.

You're right, but this hasn't caused problems for me yet.
Senderbase.org shows my server is between 3.9 and 4.6 magnitude for an
idea of what scale we're talking about.

Hasn't been an issue, even under fairly high load (like playing Vice

You're going to approach the spam idea without just filtering it?  If
you identify and do something with it, you've essentially filtered it.

I'm somehow reminded of a dude who told me, several years ago, he got a
virus on his computer when somebody put an infected floppy disk in his
floppy drive *with the computer powered down.*  The computer was never
on with the floppy disk in there.

You see, his computer virus was smart enough it was actually able to
jump off the disk and infect the computer.  All by itself.

I think it's pretty easy to filter the wrong thing with very simplistic
filters.  If it has the letter 'a' somewhere in it (and all spam I've
received has) and I filter based on that, I've filtered a lot of the
'wrong thing.'

I think more advanced filtering approaches like SpamAssassin which apply
weights to various traits are an ideal solution.

I don't think I know anybody who could come up with a whitelist of every
email address they communicate with.  My 89-year-old grandfather
couldn't, and he's on AOL's 5-hour-a-month billing plan.

Handled off-site?  By whom?  And handled how?  Why not do the filtering
on-site?  It's usually cheaper to run these things locally than to run
them on some different physical location.  That just doesn't make much
sense to me.

A dirty site?  lol

That scheme sounds just messed up... if they're going to have to look at
the address anyway (and how many times have you seen two spams from the
same address?) why not just let it through to their inbox?

WHY?  Spam coming through a mail server doesn't make the mail server
infected with some virus it spreads to every computer it can contact.

I need to do some hardware hacking, but only have people with high-level
progrmaming skills.

I have a 20V pulse signal which I want to get into a program.  I'm thinking RS232
would be the easiest way to get this signal.  I've searched google and came up
with one suggestion which is to use the DSR as the signal to read for the pulse.
I would need to cut the voltage down to 5V to do this.

If I were to explore this method, how can I read the DSR signal from a higher
language such as perl/python/java?  Are there serial functions in these languages
to read DSR?

Or if anyone else has a better solution.

Well, you're welcome to adapt it and post a comment to do that.  If
you want instructions on how to get your favorite MTA and virus
software to work together to reject at SMTP-time, please post a

running Cat-5
off a spool is that I would have needed to premeasure and pre cut.

Don't run standard Cat-5 through ducting unless you like hydrochloric 
acid, etc.
Also, it's a good idea to use sheilded cable if you can afford it.  Stay 
away from
transformers and power lines as much as possible.  Beware of inductance 
on coax
lines, consider using toroids if you know enough about them and they're 
needed.
  
I think Ethernet wires run at somewhere close to 300-400 volts, get 
shocked once
and you'll probably never touch a live ethernet wire again.  Stranded 
cable is best,
but not really necessary.  Stranded cable is more break resistant and 
actually has
more conductive surface area than solid core wire.  Good patch cables 
are made
of stranded cable.  Cat 5 has to do with the number of twists per foot. 
 If you
open Cat 5 UTP cable, you'll find that there are four pairs of wires twisted
together, hence the Cat 5.  I relplaced bell wire with Cat-5, the 
telephone people
were impressed because the single quality is better.  UTP stands for 
unshielded
twisted pair.  STP is the shielded variety.  Plenum Cat-5 goes through 
ducts.

UTP cable 1000 ft four pair was around $80, but that was a couple of 
years ago.

Exim is pretty hard to mis-configure into an open relay.  The default

There's critical warnings about sendmail security more often than
Windows, and was a principal cause of the Great Worm of 1988.  I don't
consider sendmail secure.

No kidding...that's just more trouble than it's worth.  For the sake
of sanity, one email per user, and for system roles, one email per
role.  Nobody really needs more than that, just needs to get better at
email management.  Don't punish your correspondents just because
you're a lazy bastard uninterested in solving your own problems.

  You can read the serial port with C. Is that sufficiently high level for
you?

Why would running it off a spool require you to premeasure and precut
whereas something else wouldn't?

I think you're smokin' some of that HCl, bud.  :-)

Why would CAT5 sent through ducting cause any HCl to be anywhere,
exactly?  We're not planning on it catching on fire.  If we were, we'd
just get Plenum cable, anyway....

Transformers and power lines?

We're cabling in a house, aren't we?

FWIW, I ran some CAT5 in this house alongside some electric cable and
haven't had any issues at all with it.

Of course, it isn't running but 120 volts.

You're nuts!

Ethernet wires are NOT considered HOT!  They're what you call 'safety
extra-low voltage' circuits.  You will not get a jolt from network
cables!  PLEASE check the Lost & Found for your Clue, you seem to be
missing it.

Yeah, stranded is best if you're looking at cable that might be moving,
but if you're running it through a wall it's going to be darned static.

These cables are made out of copper, not aluminum.  Copper conducts
electricity throughout the entire strand.  Aluminum is the one you have
to worry about surface area with.

The category is determined by the number of twists per foot, *NOT* the
number if pairs of wires involved.  There is such a thing as 50 and
100-pair CAT5 cable out there.  The category has nothing to do with the
number of pairs.

What is generating the signal?  Do you know the output impedance?
Strictly speaking, an RS232 input should accept voltages from -25V to
+25V.  If you are unsure about the voltage, I would connect the signal
to a separate serial port board.  I definitely wouldn't connect the 
signal to a laptop, for Murphy's sake.  The input impedance of an RS232
input is ~4.7K ohms, so you could connect to the RS232 port through
a 4.7K resistor.  That would cut the input voltage in half, putting
it well within the comfort zone for RS232.  That's assuming the output
impedance of whatever is generating the pulse is low.

Also, you said pulse.  How wide is the pulse?  If it is long (> 100 ms),
you shouldn't have a problem polling DSR.

I would suggest looking at pyserial.  I think it can do what you want.

1988... in recent years, it's possible (and not horribly difficult) to
keep a safe and secure sendmail setup.

I'm going to take this moment to not go off on too much of a political
rant.  ;-)

I do want to say, though, I'm regularly surprised at how democrats can
be so consistently shocked that anybody voted for a republican, saying
"but I don't know ANYBODY who voted for him!" while that just doesn't
happen the other way around.

I think it says something about the general awareness of the two
parties...

> Friends don't let friends use AOL.

Why not?

It works.  It is really easy.  It is safe.  I dare say it is likely the
best email system out there for novice Internet users with no desire to
do anything except email friends and family.

Michael, 
A little far off from what I needed, but thanks anyhow. 

AthlonRob, 
Give it a rest.

I think the best solution will be craft my own two-slotted face plate
with one slot for coax and one for ethernet. Fry's sells blank face
plates and separate inserts for RJ11, BNC, RJ45, coax, etc, etc. 

So I'll just drill another hole above the existing one and slap on a
face plate to both sides of the wall. A simple, practical solution. 

Thanks for comments, 
sasha

Sorry, I'm still not sure if I'm feeding a troll (which is a bad
thing)... or just correcting bad information.

I hate seeing such CRAP information... stuff that is so far off the
mark... end up in a mailing list.  Especially one that is archived.  And
also especially one that has people who might not recognize Michael's

Many non-plenum cables use PVC (polyvinylchloride) as their sheathing.  I
doubt anything short of ignition (260C) would generate any appreciable
HCl, and even in those circumstances HCl would be the least of my worries.

Although hydrochloric acid sounds impressive, its effects are very
short-lived and you're going to notice it burning your lungs.  Mild
exposure to HCl causes no long-term problems.  (I.e. if you leave the area
and survive, you're in good shape.  ;-)  Compare this to the insidious
danger posed by colorless, odorless, CO (carbon monoxide).

I'd be more worried about the dioxin and mystery compounds present in the
PVC smoke whose effects are more long-term...

Still, to be properly fire-code-compliant, plenum-rated cable should be
used in ductwork.

The openness of your relay has nothing to do with the security of your

Phew... 1988?  You sure can hold a grudge.

I've been running sendmail for a very long time and none of my systems

I'm just stunned that one would be expected to with whom one would like to
communicate before the communication takes place.

I suppose if you're extremely close-minded and only accept ideas that you
already know you're going to accept (like, say, a religious person), then
it makes sense... otherwise, it's lunacy.

Oh, I don't know about that.  I use multiple roles (mail addresses) for my
personal stuff.  There's lots of good reasons.

At one time I considered using plus-addresses for mailing lists (and I'm
kind of surprised more people don't), but then God created procmail and it
is good.

It's neither his laziness nor his disinterest but his misunderstanding of
the problems and his unwillingness to acknowledge the viability of
existing solutions.

I don't have a spam problem and I get hundreds of them every day.

I've used a few of those, Jeme.  Some were worth their salt, and some
weren't.  But the point is, configuring iptables--whether manually or by
dint of a GUI--really isn't for newbies.  So I'm looking for a good
default configuration that would just need to be switched on.

Well, it's not overboard.  Sendmail is hard to configure, so it's hard 
to configure
properly.  Sendmail is still insecure, and likely will always be so.  A 
little googling
and you can find out about exploits of even the most recent releases of 
sendmail-8.
I have the 3000 page book on sendmail, no thanks.  Postfix and even qmail
are easier to work with than sendmail.  They were written with security in
mind.  If you really think Sendmail can be set up securely, try to convince
Wietse Venema.  He wrote Postfix to replace sendmail.

I'm working on a way to deal with it that's beyond simply deciding what
to delete and hoping it won't be opened in the wrong place.  If you're spam
control approach is just delete it, that's real work.  If it's to block 
individual
spammers, enjoy not having a life anymore.  Even with spamassassin if you
don't put spam in a place where you can check for false positives, you will
lose some valid email.  I say have the stuff you don't trust in some 
safe form
or don't worry about getting new contacts through email.



"
1) Spam creates excess heat and ruins hard disks that host mail spools.

You see, his computer virus was smart enough it was actually able to
jump off the disk and infect the computer.  All by itself.

I'm somehow reminded of a dude who told me, several years ago, he got a
virus on his computer when somebody put an infected floppy disk in his
floppy drive *with the computer powered down.*  The computer was never
on with the floppy disk in there.
"




If you're getting hit with a lot of spam that's causing your hard drive 
to spin constantly
it will burn out the motor.  Please use a little common sense when 
crticizing someone
by at least attempting to come up with a criticism that is related to 
what was said.



"
2) The more complex your filtering is, the easer it is to filter the 
wrong thing.
I think it's pretty easy to filter the wrong thing with very simplistic
filters. If it has the letter 'a' somewhere in it (and all spam I've
received has) and I filter based on that, I've filtered a lot of the
'wrong thing.'

I think more advanced filtering approaches like SpamAssassin which apply
weights to various traits are an ideal solution.
"


Spamassassin on my system can't detect valid html where I don't know if 
there are any
upgrades to fix that.  I don't use simple filters, though at least you 
tried on this criticism.



"
 3) Most people can build a list of who they contact and are contacted 
by through an
     email address, this can be used to reduce the namespace that needs 
to be filtered
    for some accounts.

   I don't think I know anybody who could come up with a whitelist of every
   email address they communicate with. My 89-year-old grandfather
   couldn't, and he's on AOL's 5-hour-a-month billing plan."
"



I could.  Especially if attempts by people I don't let in are known to 
be my the
header of the message.  If the mesesage is on hold, it can definitely 
get through.  
If I don't want to check what mail isn't being let in, why should I?



"

4)   Untrusted mail needs to be handled off site or thrown away.

Handled off-site?  By whom?  And handled how?  Why not do the filtering
on-site?  It's usually cheaper to run these things locally than to run
them on some different physical location.  That just doesn't make much
sense to me.

"



Off site meaning set up another network locally on seperate machines and 
deal with
it on those.  If you can develop a procedure to inject email that can be 
shown to be
safe and that the intended recipient has demonstrated interest in into 
the production
environment from the dirty environment, than by all means do that.



"
I'm planning on mailservers on my gateways that spool in ram and dump to
Sandisks in emergencies to address issue 1. These mail servers are going to
be developed to selectively relay to my existing MTA.

Hope you don't have any power outages....

"



Not a problem.  I have a UPS and I dump to Sandisk in the event of a power
outage.  Sandisks are nonvolatile solid state memory devices that are low
temperature and low power.  I'm also looking at two relays paired together
and spool mirroring.




"
Issue 2 will be eased by allowing email from unknown senders to be held
until the source is trusted or a period of 24 hours passes . I'm 
thinking, have
a website internally for the intended recipient to indicate that a 
sender is okay,

if they want. If a person had been asked about a sender and doesn't
trust that sender, the message can simply be sent to a dirty site right
away.

A dirty site? lol

That scheme sounds just messed up... if they're going to have to look at
the address anyway (and how many times have you seen two spams from the
same address?) why not just let it through to their inbox?
"



If the user gets tired of accepting new senders, new senders will be 
rerouted to a
dirty mail mail site.  If the sender address are not valid and this can 
be caught at
the smtp stage.  Unless there's an expectation for a specific invalid 
address
why let the message in at all in the first place?  If spammers always 
use different
addresses and always use invalid ones, that should be easy to stop. 
 Valid senders
who won't use the same email address, within reason, are going to be a 
major
communication challenge regardless of the email system chosen.  You
don't have to look at mail on the dirty site if you're not concerned and
administration can be eased by putting a one week timeout on any
message sent there.

That's why it's optional.  I'm proprosing a way to give local recipients 
the power to
have accounts where senders have to rely on them to be able to get in at 
all.  For
business accounts, this makes a lot of sense.  Unlike common CR systems,
registration messages will NOT be sent out.  This email list is a 
registration
system, you can't sign someone else up for it against their will.  All 
of my
users should have one address where they can find out about potential
new senders, but they shouldn't be forced to choose new mail sources from
those that have been routed to a dirty site.  By dealing with questionable
mail outside of the production environment, risk to the production
environment is controlled.  I envision hosting some accounts that are CR 
like
and some that aren't.

Any filtering scheme of any kind can generate false positives.  Quite
frankly, a second mail site for stuff you don't trust offers a means to
make sure nothing important is missed.  Anybody should be able to
send to the postmaster.  Do you want to filter email from anybody on
a server you're worried about?  Do you want to jam up smtp to do a
virus scan between your smtp server and one you don't control?  One
valid point that Jeme has made is that breaking smtp isn't a good idea.  
With a dirty mail mail site, you don't have to.  If this angers someone
because they are intent of flipping someone off, I suggest that person
seek counseling.

Most viruses and worms are spam.  If you can mark anything that
could be a virus or trojan, why let it on a server that has clients your 
trying
to protect connected?  If you can't be certain of everything that is 
malware,
all the more reason to deal with the unknown in an appropriate way.



"

>Things coming through a mail server don't infect the system...

 It helps to use Postfix or Qmail since these are designed to resist 
exploit,
but complacency about crackers is never a wise policy.

Saying that smtp software can't be hacked only encourages someone
out there to do just that.  Discrete Mathematics has a proof that
no simple algorithm can show that any program being tested will not
crash.  I see a simlpe extension of this logic to setting
up mail filtering.
  
It's important that viruses be caught and stopped in transmission, not 
on the
hosts they're trying to get onto.  This tears down anti viral requirements.

If you don't stop garbage at the server, you'll have to check for it on
every machine receiving mail service.  You'll have to upgrade all
over the place.  The person who doesn't go after this before it gets
on a workstation, laptop, or personal computer is nuts!

An smtp agent can be infected.  Sendmail comes to mind.  Buffer
overflow is a common source of exploit.  There have been many
exploits of smtp software.

The advantage of a dirty mail mail site is that you don't run the risk of
breaking things by trying to virus scan at smtp time between yourself
and a site that doesn't understand what you're doing.  If you're willing
to break things, don't use smtp then and have the people you want to
communicate with support whatever other transport protocol you're
interested in.



What is needed is a safe way to look at email that doesn't filter or that a
filter thinks is dangerous, so that an administrator can get just the
information that's needed to know if it's safe or not.

Spam is an annoyance, why not have spamassassin messages go to a
second site as long as the intended recipient is allowed to check there?
Give your users a clean mailbox, really.

Oh I see, religion is the problem for everything.  I wouldn't be on a 
mailing list taking
insults like this if I didn't see a point in doing so.  Whether or not a 
person is religious
has less than everything to do with what they are aware of or accepting 
of.  

This is a broad statement that doesn't in my opinion pass the test of 
bigotry.

There are some people who believe that their religious view must be 
foisted on others
politically.  I don't.  Radical Muslims do.  That's why we're losing 
troops in Iraq
now.  No matter how people feel about Iraq, I hope they see the courage 
of a lot
of the troops that are over there.

I do care about the problems with email, that's very true.

go touch a live ethernet wire and make sure it's 300 millivolts.

Who says allowing local users to restrict certain addresses so that you 
have to
be on a list to send to them is in any way punishment?  Indeed it gives 
local users
the freedom to associate with Internet email sources in a way they may very
much appreciate.  After all, I don't want to step on anyone's freedom to 
assemble
as they deem fit.  

As far as being deserving of a derogatory label, no comment.  When it comes
to being lazy on a public mailing list, I suppose I could be lazy 
privately and
seek to have my questions answered on an individual basis so the larger
Portland Linux User's Group community will be guranteed to not benefit
in any way.  I know the information I gave was mostly correct, isn't it a
shame that I'm not as stupid as some people want me to be?

Regarding the idea of using email extensions, that's an interesting 
approach.
I'm glad some people choose to be positive and helpful.  Actually, I think
I'm approaching what AOL does.  I agree that they are not evil.

Actually, I showed a friend who runs cable for a living your email.  He
thought it was quite funny, and completely wrong.

He does sometimes need to cut live cables (with a metal knife, which
conducts electricity) and never has received any kind of an electric
shock from ethernet cables.  He did say he has, once or twice, cut a
cable that was running POTS stuff when it was ringing.  He said that
caused a mild shock, with about as much of a jolt as you get from
sneakers on a carpet in August in Central Oregon.

Show me that there is an any intention in this email to contribute to 
the community
or get something on this archived plug list that is in any way on topic. 
 So what if
mistaking millivolts for volts is funny, I suppose it is kinda funny.

I've gotten a shock before myself, it can really hurt to touch a live 
phone wire when
it goes high.  I don't recommend to anyone that they purposely touch any 
live wires
at any voltage.  Ah the wonders of service disconnects.  They make 
wiring so much
safer, and they're so inexpensive.

It's always a good idea to be careful around electricity.  Yeah you can 
touch an electric
fence and it may be more or less than a phone line, but it's not a good 
idea in general.
Just ask a horse or a cow.  I think they smell something coming off a 
hot wire.  A
smart horse knows when the fence is hot and when it isn't.

I don't think it's the voltage that's the real problem, I think it's the 
current.  The human
body has something similar to electrical wiring involving the brain and 
nervous system
that is suceptible to electrical overload.  There may be little cause 
for concern with 300
millivolt low amperage signal wires, but there's no reason to be 
careless.  Maybe it makes
you feel stupid to get shocked on a low voltage signal wire, but people 
really should from
good habits around electricity.  One good lightning strike and that wire 
could be carrying
far more current than it normally would, perhaps enough to be dangerous.

I've had problems running three servers getting shocked on the cases. 
 Given enough
signal wire, I guess there's a point where the wiring becomes a safety 
issue.  Low quality
switching could be the culprit too, perhaps a good reason to use a 
plastic case KVM
switch instead of the cheaper metal box dumb variants.

Well I'm not an EE, my older brother basically is though.  He deals with 
Industrial three
phase power though he says people really should be careful even around 
phone lines.
Apparently some electricians have no respect for electricity, sadly you 
wonder how long
those people will last.

If you are getting shocked by a case, you have grounding problems.

Not religion, religiosity.  I'm using the term in the generic sense, as
one might describe Emacs zealots as "religious".

In a sense, the term is meant as the opposite of, say, "scientific".
While the scientific method is to observe phenomena and form theories and
derive abstractions from the observations, religious thought requires one
to interpret the phenomena in the context of the abstractions and existing
theories.  One does not take a religious belief, test it, then dismiss it
if the test fails.  The belief is constant while the world shifts instead
of shifting beliefs around more and more understanding of a constant
world.

This has little to do with spirituality.

I'm not sure how to parse that sentence.

Nor that one.  If it doesn't pass the test of bigotry, does that mean it
cannot be labelled bigotry (for failing the test)?  Your ambiguity
confounds.

Uh... wha?  A religious view requires all other understanding to be
interpreted within the context of faith.  I don't give a hang one way or
the other if you or anyone else attempts to foist their religious views on
others.  I trust that the theories of the Enlightenment (including the
scientific method) have nearly become deeply enough ingrained in the
cultural fabric to prevent full-scale Inquisition and the like.  Enough
people are capable of judging for themselves that the irrational can be
allowed to do as they please without fear of infecting the rest of
civilization.

Wow.  Non-sequitor alert... but anyway, this seems like a fine example of
"foisting views".

But really it's more like someone coming over to your house, busting down
your door, then renting you a door (then tearing out your plumbing and
polluting your well then renting you water service, etc., etc.).

[And if the intent were to create a "liberated" state that respects the
sovereignty of the people of Iraq, it would seem the rebuilding effort
would start with the U.S. Constitution and a Xerox machine... but
apparently that's not the goal. -- No, the goal is clearly to open markets
and create yet another client state with little or no sovereignty.]

> I do care about the problems with email, that's very true.

Perhaps you should spend more time analyzing the system and understanding
its strengths before you start devising work-arounds for its perceived
weaknesses.

I find that your draconian (and often far-fetched and misinformed)
proposals destroy those things that make email a valuable communication
tool in order to avoid a minor annoyance.

And _I_ am consistently shocked that every Republican thinks that people
who oppose Bush are Democrats.

I suppose that's how the nation is kept so hopelessly right-wing -- by
flat denial of the existence of the left.  (This is done because, I think,
the exposure of the radical left would show how far right the Democratic
party is and that there is only the tiniest gap between the
mainstream-right and the most right you can imagine.  Most people are most
comfortable defining themselves as moderates or "middle of the road".
Public discourse across the political spectrum would push the average
person far left of the pathetic Democratic Party so discussion is
carefully steered as far right as possible.)

I think the phrase "the two parties" says something about the general
awareness of Americans.

No, you don't.  I've run cable before, you put your spool box down by
the hole you're running the cable from, and pull it through the walls
to where you're going using fishtape, then once you've secured the end
of the cable, go pull the excess slack out, make your cut, and throw
on the connectors.  It's pretty botch-proof if you know how to use a
crimper and fishtape.

I've handled live ethernet wire before.  Never shocked.  Only time I
got shocked was when I was running ethernet cable, and some jackass
decided to test out an etherkiller on the opposite end of the line I
was working on.  That hurt like hell.  No equipment was damaged, save
for my hand and temporarily tripping the breaker the outlet was on
that I unwittingly shorted with a crimper.

> Cat 5 has to do with the number of twists per foot.

Not exclusively.  Number of wires also factors in.  Category 3 cable
is 4-strand wire, and commonly uses RJ-11 connectors (aka a phone
cord).  As opposed to Catagory 5's 8-strand cord, commonly used with
RJ-45 connectors (aka an Ethernet cable)

Not only that, but breaks SMTP.  Just try mailing someone something
mission-critical then go on vacation for two weeks to someone with CR
(something I did in 2001, except I didn't know they were running a
broken MTA).  They lost their job, then blamed me because their MX was
busted and was stupidly waiting for me to reply.  Thank God he was

Well, for different personal roles, plus addresses are your friend if
you're not a procmail god.  The reason plus addresses are better than
entirely different addresses, is that your correspondents don't have
to remember a bunch of different addresses, just user+role at site and if
they're not sure which role, then just user at site still works.

You've never done technical support.  AOL fairly frequently breaks
Windows, particularly after a new version of AOL's software before
everybody's figured out just how this version of AOL breaks Windows.

And that's not even getting into the dozens of reasons why AOL should
never have been granted IP transit.

One version of AOL was known as the "upgrade of death" by many users who 
tried it.

AOL has also been notorious for assuming that it is the only connection to 
the outside world.  It has a tendancy to kill anything that works with any 
other isp.

Also, it has had one of the worst mail programs on the face of the planet. 
(One of the reasons that AOL users were viewed as idiots (other than 
acting like one) is that the mail client was unable to quote previous 
messages.)

When AOL first got on Usenet, they pissed everyone off because they had a 
bug that sent every message from AOL about eight times.

They have never had the best reputation on the net.

Actually, yes, exclusively.

Cat-3 may normally only be two pair that you've seen, but I have at
least two or three cat-3 patch cables floating around for use with old
10BaseT NICs.  I can assure you, they have an RJ-45 connector at each
end with four pairs of wires.

Cat-5 that *you* have seen may have all been 4-pair... but if you look
for it, you can find even 50 or 100 pair cat-5 cable out there.  Beyond
100 pair, it becomes difficult to maintain the quality, as I understand
it, so most cable over 100 pair is only rated at cat-3.

The category of cable is based upon the number of twists per foot.  The
number of twists is what allows it to function at the various levels...
16Mbps for cat 3, 100Mbps for cat 5.  

Saying cat-5 is always 4-pair and cat-3 is always 2-pair is like saying
all vehicles on the road have four wheels...

You falsely assume I falsely assumed you're a Democrat.  :-)

That's odd; I've never had AOL break Windows nor have I heard of it
breaking Windows.  I haven't ever manned a tech support phone, but I
definitely do quite a bit of support for friends, family, and
customers.  Many, if not most, of them use AOL under Windows.

AOL used to frequently break AOL, but that hasn't really been the case
so much in the last three years or so.

I have certainly communicated with more AOL members, even about their
computers, than you.  I used to be very active on several techie groups
on AOL (and only have recently, in the last year, not been using it).

AOL 7.0 did have problems with some crappy VPN software, but aside from
that, there really haven't been a plethora of complaints about AOL in
recent years breaking existing connections.  Certainly not in released
versions.

But it is *sooo* easy to use for Grandpa or Joe Lunchbox.  I'd love to
have set my grandfather up with Linux, but he would have had to spend a
lot more time learning how to do things when all he wants to do is email
and play one of his 100+ solitare card games.

And it is *really* easy to quote from previous messages in AOL.  You
simply highlight the text you're responding to and hit Reply.

They recently opened their mail servers up to IMAP and remote
(authenticating) SMTP access, so your options are endless.

Maybe it's close minded to reject ideas that require faith.
 The scientific method isn't perfect, it works best
when it isn't taken outside of it's own sphere of relevance.
But go ahead, pursue a purely secular world view.
I'd say that one's life will be richer if they don't
create religious tension where none exists, but
don't believe me ;-)

Anti religious spouting is way out of line.  It has no relevance to 
setting up
a webmail site.  You seem more interested in foisting certain views on
others who don't want them than sticking to the topics of this list.  That
would require social discipline, you clearly reject this though.

Indeed the Constitution of the United States gurantees freedom of religious
expression.  Strange that this would be interpreted to mean freedom from.
You wouldn't criticize someone for being a certain way because
the root reason might be religious, would you?  You're grossly
misinformed about history, I would not rely on the idea of the inquisition
being such a terrible thing.  Even if it did bother me so much, it doesn't
as a complaint support an outright rejection of individual and collective
freedom of religious expression alone.

It's more like, Clinton did nothing and September 11th happened.  Bush 
took an aggressive
attitude with a military Clinton had reduced in size and isn't being 
supported.  Never mind
that Bush even if we should send more troops doesn't want to.  It is 
harsh to be using
so many reservists when you don't have the regulars.  Clinton did worse 
than nothing, he fire
bombed muslim countries around Christmas which could accomplish nothing 
and probably
only inflamed the region.  An impotent show of force hitting only the 
wrong people is the
worst use of force that there is.

I think you're assuming that Iraqi's like the U.S. Constitution at this 
point, they're
not Westerners who seperate church and state in the cultural way we do. 
 Indeed,
fundamentalist Islam holds that it's of religious importance who governs 
and what
religion he/she supports.  There are non fundamentalist muslims, but so 
far one must
question the potential for any of them to influence the muslim street 
adequately.  
Supposedly noone liked Saddham, isn't it interesting that no muslim country
would support our going in to Iraq on the premise of removing someone they
supposedly don't like.  It religiously offends some muslims that non 
muslims
are in control of a muslim country.  Never mind that muslims religiously,
fundamentalists types, want to subjugate the whole world under a muslim
super state.  This is the type of muslim Bin Laden, and we know he is so 
driven
that he will kill even fellowmuslims if they try to stand in his way, 
is.  Islam has
been at war with the west since it came into existence.  There was a time in
Europe when the pope had to pay 25000 silver pieces a year to keep Vatican
city free of Islamic rule.  There needs to be a foundational shift in 
Islamic
thinking, until that happens there will be times where force is justified.  
Hopefully, the world will globalize without becoming an islamic super
state and the spread of posterity will make it harder to recruit extremists.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux Wifi Clinic - Saturday May 15 11am to 5pm
Message-ID: <20040507190639.GA8502@gate.kl-ic.com>

This is a reminder of the Linux Wifi Clinic on Saturday, May 15 
from 11AM to 5PM.  Riverdale High School off Terwilliger in SW
Portland.   http://hs.riverdale.k12.or.us/directions.html 
The school has tables and power plugs, and lots of bandwidth to the
Internet. 

Invite your friends (well, no, not YOUR friends... :-) )  Post this
to other user groups.  If you are a business owner and too busy to
do your own setup, stop by and meet some of the many consultants
available who you can pay to do it for you.

There was a great deal of interest at the PLUG meeting last night,
with quite a few Linux people interested in attending and helping. 
The big question there was, how many Wifi savvy folks would be there
from Personal Telco Project?  Some folks have made enthusiastic
commitments, but the more the merrier!

There are three levels of project we -could- do:
   (1)  basic Linux system setup on a laptop
>> (2)  setting up Wifi and road warrior security
   (3)  setting up a PTP node
   (4)  WAP hacking, like reprogramming WRT54Gs .

However, in the interests of time, we will be concentrating on (2),
setting up Wifi on laptops with Linux already running.  Setting up
portable security, IPTABLES, SSH keys, etc. will be a priority.  If
the clinic works out OK, we can be more ambitious the next time.  We
would like to concentrate on 802.11B.  Again, we can do G the next
time.  This is not to say we can't do some distro installs, or some
advanced hacking, after we get everyone up and running and secure and
cracker-tested;  I just think we will have a full day with the basics. 

So, prerequisites:

  (1)  Patience, and a willingness to help others if you can.

  (2)  A laptop with a reasonably recent Linux installed, and
       -backed up- (we will be testing security, you may get
       root-kitted).   Bring your AC adapter, CD drive, floppy
       drive, ethernet card, or whatever you need to move bits.
       We will be Linux distro agnostic:  Redhat 8, Debian ?, SUSE
       ?, Mandrake ?, or better.   Within the last two years so
       we can be sure there are drivers and security updates for
       that distro.  Avoid Lindows (too insecure). Unless someone
       is pretty familiar with wifi drivers for 2.6, we should
       avoid this recently introduced kernel.  

       If you want a nice distro for newbies, I suggest Xandros
       Desktop 2 Deluxe, which is based on Debian and has a lot of
       features designed for the new user.  If you are a cheapskate,
       download Debian or Fedora Core 1 (not 2!) and burn some CDs. 
       Check http://www.linux-laptop.net  for laptop gotchas.  No,
       you cannot run a decent road-warrior Linux on your 286 8Mbyte
       240x320 10 year old cheapo.  We are not here to help you 
       recover from horrendously bad buying decisions.

  (3)  A wifi card with linux drivers.  I suggest a PRISM based
       Senao card, 2511CD 200mW .  Cheaper, lower power PRISM
       cards are around, but beware, some manufacturers change to 
       unsupported chipsets while keeping the same model number.
       If you are unsure, ask the list.  We can support beta or
       oddball drivers if someone steps up to support and configure
       those drivers.  The Atheros G stuff looks interesting, but
       we need a volunteer to take care of those installs. 
       Built-in wifi can be "challenging".

  (4)  The ethernet-connected Wireless Access Point (WAP) that
       you plan to use at home (no USB unless you are sure you
       can configure it from Linux).  If you are using the WAP
       with external DHCP and routing, you may want to bring in
       your server (yikes!). 

       If you don't have a WAP, I suggest the $80-$100 Linksys
       WRT54G (not GS, and serial numbers starting with CD5...)
       because it is a customizer's playground, or the $40-$60
       Linksys BEFW11S4 because it is cheap and easy. Note that
       almost all current WAP units are web-page configured and
       pretty easy to figure out if you've read the docs.

  (5)  Documentation - bring your system notebook to make notes
       and write down procedures (you DO have a system notebook,
       yes?  If not, buy a steno pad and start taking notes!).
       Also, manuals for your WAP, wifi card, Linux distro, and
       pointers to websites you have found useful so far.  Read
       the docs you have, please!  

  (6)  Think up some secure, easy to remember passwords.  I like
       initial letters and numbers, like 4oYbabtU ( 4 of Your bases
       are belong to Us ).  Rude phrases are easier to remember and
       harder to babble to others.  We may quickly crack the passwords
       you have now:  "Rover123", "Shirley", and "studMuffin" are
       overused.  I cracked 4 passwords on my father-in-law's computer
       in 230 milliseconds ... he learned to use better passwords.

  (7)  Crucifixes, magic amulets, black candles.  Prayers and/or
       Spells.  We will have good people there, but cannot guarantee
       results, so whatever supernatural gestures work for you...

  (8)  Did I mention patience?

  
Rick Lindahl ( rick at invictusnetworks.com ) will be there with some
gear to sell (Senao cards, antennas, cables, other fun stuff). 
We may also have somebody to peddle Linksys WRT54G WAPs.  Since our
vendor friends may run out before you get there, make arrangements in
advance to be sure the device you want to buy will be reserved for you.

I will probably think up more stuff before next Saturday.  Help
of any kind will be appreciated.  The cool thing about the Linux
world is that there is always something you know that somebody
else will appreciate learning (and vice versa)!

You've mentioned the major version, but not the minor version. Versions
8.6 and 8.7 followed the security patch a week trend, 8.9 and more
recently 8.12 are a very different matter. Both are major version 8, but
two are secure today, two very definitely aren't.

The last sendmail hole was found over 6 months ago, similar to the time
frame for the last postfix hole. Exim, another MTA, had a hole announced
yesterday. All Linux distributions contain helper scripts to handle
generic sendmail installations, so even if can't handle the config
yourself it isn't too difficult. None of the others include the level of
functionality that sendmail has.

True, but the 3 orders of magnitude you were off by were far more
important. 300V is dangerous to handle, 300mV can be handled utterly
casually.

In the four or so years I've been on the list, it hasn't seemed
difficult to tell that a handful of the folks that have come along (and
in a few instances, gone away) might deserve to be afforded a bit more
understanding than usual.  Would showing a little compassion and giving
them the benefit of the doubt really be expecting too much? It *is*
possible to correct another's errors without coming off as a complete
asshole. Bear in mind that the list archives will recall everyone's
posts, not just those which you consider to be spurious noise. I'd
expect this to be an important point for those wishing to maintain a
reasonable reputation in the local tech community (especially future
university graduates).

Keith,

  I am on the verge of getting my prismGT-based card (3Com's 3CRWE154G72)
running with Slackware-9.1 and the 2.4.24 kernel. Whew! (Not there yet, but
a heck of a lot closer than before.)

  For those running similar systems, make sure that your hotplug setup
includes firmware.agent (available from the Prism54 Web site) and the
firmware itself (1.0.4.3.arm).

  BTW, I'll buy one of the pcmcia cards for the older (8-bit) laptops here.

Message-ID: <20040507141920.3fcc27b7.jason@vancleve.com>

Anyone know of an antivirus library for Java?  We have an odd
requirement for a Web service in development:  we are to scan all
incoming messages for virii, within our Java application.

Well, I think this is probably the wrong architecture altogether,
personally.  Which renders my question twofold.  First, is there even a
usable Java library available for this; and second, what would be the
alternative?  If we can convince our client that we should not be virus
scanning in Java, within our application, we might get this requirement
changed.  But I'll need to make a strong case.

Couldn't we run a *nix daemon of some sort, configured to listen to our
Web ports, scan all requests and relay a modified stream to the Web
server on different ports, or so?  That daemon would only need to flag
messages as infected (an HTTP header will do), so that our application
can respond with an appropriate error.

So, my new downstairs neighbor wants Debian on their PC.  I went down and
started the installation.  It's a really old PC, so some time was involved
in unpacking the packages (though the download took just thirty minutes or
so on my blazing fast network -- heh) and today I went down to get the
video working for a nice graphical system to meet their expectations.

Lo and behold, they have some weird-ass video configuration!

It seems that on the back of their PC, there's a a video card with a six
inch cable feeding ANOTHER video card with separate 15-ping mini Dsub
connector to feed the monitor.

So we've got a Voodoo 2 card.  I assume that's an intel PCI card feeding
the voodoo card (there doesn't appear to be onboard video).

The sstfx kernel framebuffer module installs but then makes the screen
blank at installation.

I tried X with a fairly generic monitor config (haven't looked at the
monitor specs yet, but it is not totally junk for a 15 inch model) using
the tdfx xserver driver with no luck at all.

Any ideas on getting the framebuffer working on this thing?

Anybody ever used a Voodoo2 add-on card before?

Any help appreciated.

Amavis with clamav can do this.  It can be configured as a kind of SMTP
pass-through that will take a stream in one side and send it out the other
just marked for infection (or quarantined as you see fit).

Why would you want an HTTP header in an email message?

Anyway, you can certainly flag infected messages.

My father had one of these.  The Voodoo2 (I liked to call it a
"DooDoo2") provides 3D graphics.  Normally, it just passes 2D graphics
through from the onboard video.  When it goes into 3D mode, I gathered
that the DooDoo essentially cuts off the 2D input and substitutes its
own.  I think you _could_ just disconnect the DooDoo and connect the
monitor directly to mister 2D.

On the other hand, you might still be able to use DooDoo2.  I recall
the word "glide" used.  See, e.g.:
 
   <http://www.xfree86.org/4.3.0/glide.4.html>

I've got one of these sitting in a cardboard box.

Honestly, sure it would be possible to correct Michael without being
quite so rude.  It has, however, been done before and has provided no
results.

I had honestly hoped that harping on him at every turn would lead him to
leave the list again, but that doesn't seem to be working too well. 
Michael won't learn, as his posting history demonstrates.  Michael's
contributions to the list thus far have provided nothing positive I can
recall.  He regularly starts ranting about various things (which
actually lead to him leaving the list 'for good' a few months ago),
often asks vague questions without answers, and provides the list with a
plethora of just plain Wrong Information.

If I were terribly concerned about my reputation in the local tech
community I likely wouldn't be posting under a pseudonym.  Most of my
tech work that isn't for local friends and family has actually been
contract work from far away from here... I don't see much of a market in
Oregon.

And, for what it is worth, I'm not majoring in a computer field.

The only effective policy I've found for dealing with net kooks is to
simply ignore them.  They tend to thrive on attention, and ignoring them
tends to dry up their enthusiasm.  I also ignore them when they're not
being kooks (if ever), which further deprives them of whatever help they
might have otherwise gotten.  New subscribers may be at first misled
into responding or taking their advice seriously, but most people are
pretty quickly able to figure out who's worth listening to and who
isn't.

People using Cyrus IMAP and Sieve filtering can have message flags
automatically set in delivery, so you can just mark messages as read
without having to even open them.  Something like this:

if header :contains "From" [ "@robinson-west.com" ]
{
  addflag "\\Seen";
}

Otherwise, procmail can simply discard the messages.

...and I would ignore him, but he just isn't a kook like I've ever
encountered before.  It's like he genuinely wishes to help and provide
to the community, he just isn't capable of providing anything useful and
gets easily distracted.

Maybe he's just the most elaborate troll I've yet met?  :-)

Because it's not an email message but a SOAP-over-HTTP message, as many
"Web services" are.  So I need something that can scan HTTP requests and

Would something like squid-vscan set up transparently to intercept the

I've been saying that for years... and more along those same lines of
interpretting the behavior of systems as one would the behavior of a
living organism.

But the really KOOKY part about this article is this line:

'Unlike much of the soggy thinking peddled by too many anti-globalisers,
"The Corporation" is a surprisingly rational and coherent attack on
capitalism's most important institution.'

Now, I'm going to let the comment about "soggy thinking" slide.  It's full
of so many vague qualifiers ("much", "too many"... one would be too many
to some, so the statement stands) that it doesn't really mean anything.

The SHOCKING part is the last bit.  The corporation is "capitalism's most
important institution"?!?  Are these people totally ignorant?  Adam Smith
makes it VERY CLEAR in his Wealth of Nations (particularly in Chapter 10)
that the firm is an ENEMY of capitalism and can do nothing but hurt the
public interest.  (Granted now that Smith viewed capitalism as a force of
enlightenment rather than a scheme for domination.)

Now, I'm not going to defend capitalism[1] here, but to say that an attack
on corporations is an attack on capitalism is way off base and just shows
how frighteningly effective corporate propaganda has been.

J.

[1] Props where props are due, I suppose... capitalism did go some ways to
serving Smith's purpose of increasing worker productivity, but the profit
motive and a lack of social values has failed to translate that increase
in productivity into more leisure time for the working class opting,
instead, for higher profits and more wealth for the ruling class.

You can do the same thing as your sieve filter above with
procmail/formail, like so:

  :0f
  * ^From:.*@robinson-west.com
  | /usr/bin/formail -A "Status: RO"

I do something similar so that duplicate messages aren't treated as new:

  # Mark duplicates as already read.
  :0 Whc: msgid.lock
  | /usr/bin/formail -D 8192 msgid.cache

  :0 fWa
  | /usr/bin/formail -A "Status: RO"

See the formail(1), procmailrc(5), and procmailex(5) manpages for more
details.

Excuse me,  how about if from contains @athlonrob.com or @brelin.net?

Jeme and AthlonRob are still going, I hope people realize that I
myself haven't posted anything until now in contrast.

Just as well I suppose.  If the three or four individuals who have decided
to be extremely irritating block me, maybe I can be heard by others who
aren't so problematic.

"We are a group of enthusiasts dedicated to teaching and learning about

all levels of experience."

I guess that's just a lie.  I don't feel enthusiastic anymore.  I tried 
to help someone, look what happened when I made a mistake that was 
really only off by an order of
magnitude.  I'm not an EE.  I am a two year degreed political exile from 
PSU.  If people genuinely love this subject, I do not expect to offend 
so many that I would be
driven off purposely over a simple mistake.  It's very hard to take what 
Paul Mullen wrote.  It is a good suggestion to be careful on a local 
tech list.  My experience with
plug, if I am to take it seriously, has only suggested that I won't ever 
work in a local IT position.  At least not in a position supporting 
Linux and Unix environments.

Everyone should realize that that quote is from the main page they 
signed up through.  If it's wrong, it really needs to be taken down 
before someone else ends up in the
same boat I am in facing a post like this.

The sad story is, I have seen admissions by some on this list that they 
were purposely trying to intimidate me into staying off.  I guess that's 
considered acceptable behavior.
I guess also that there's some reason to get angry with mistakes even 
though this is email and therefore long distance communication.  By 
definition, limited and error prone.

You'd better make that @axpr.net ... I don't own AthlonRob.com (although
the other AthlonRob and I had thought a little bit about buying it).

FWIW, other domains I might send email from include no-ip-here.net and
insert-ip-here.net.

Mr. Robinson, you might need to lurk for a while and go read The
Jargon File before you start posting again.  Welcome to the Net, not
very often we find people who get to Linux before going online.

Is this why Portland unfairly taxes business and hired out of nation
help for the big pipe project?  I sense a hatred of business, why would
I want to be in a place that has such a problem?  Maybe this is the reason
why Oregon has had the worst unemployment in the nation.  

I will say that there are multiple corporation types.  There are small cap
and big cap corporations.  Even families sometimes form corporations
to distribute land, etc.  Before everyone thinks corporation means
oppression and excessive wealth, consider that it's not really fair if
only the rich can have tax breaks.  Corporations are a means for less
wealthy entities to save on taxes and build up.

It's not capitalism or any other government system that is a problem, it's
whether or not a few extremely successfull people are greedy to the
point of absurdity.  Consider, the value of wealth goes down
if you have more than you can possibly spend, no remaining customer
base, and it doesn't make you happy.

It's been a bad week.  Even the press is embarassed
to some degree reporting, a first really.  I hope it raises the bar on our
hopes for the individual person and causes a ripple affect here at home
in a positive way, the way the super bowl scandal did.  If it didn't make
us angry, the Iraqi people would be right in thinking that we aren't
commited to their freedom.  I don't blame Rumsfeld or Bush, shame
how investigations are just getting started and already a problem that
Rumsfeld may not have been able to predict or prevent is being used
by some to pressure him into resigning.  I think this country believes
in innocent until proven guilty.

My father was pressured in the military by a superior officer to disregard
his beliefs and pressure his subordinates.  He refused being thrown down
two ship ladders for his actions, but he did refuse.  There should have
been a court martial of that superior but my father didn't seek one.  
Fortunately, my father didn't have any more problems with him.  The
point he made was this, pressure can be hard to resist but there's a
higher principal to uphold.  Even my mother didn't know this story
till tonight, it was a real surprise.

Actually, more like all cars have four wheels, all bicycles have two.
To say that all vehicles on the road have four wheels is to say
everything that has an RJ-11 or RJ-45 connector is a phone cord
(whether or not it fits, anybody who has done network troubleshooting
over the phone, and the guy on the other end is an idiot[1], knows what
I'm talking about).


[1] Idiots suck.  They don't know that they don't know, so they think
they know, and call you up, and refuse to take your advice, thinking
they know better.  Terminally stupid[2].

[2] I differentiate between stupid and ignorant.  Both are ignorant
and both imply the person is capable of learning in the first place.
To qualify as stupid, you have to fail to learn when provided with
ample clue.  Ignorance is readily fixed, stupidity could be terminal[1].

I was re-running the phone lines in the walls in my first apartment
(since it had five phone outlets and only one that actually worked,
got credit from my landlord for doing it, too) at two in the morning
(too hot to sleep) and I held a couple of the wire leads in my teeth
for a second.  Well, I wasn't concerned about the ~12VDC of the phone
line under normal conditions, but I did forget about the ~90VAC that a
phone line carries when it rings.  And at that moment, someone dialed
the wrong number.  Dropped that wire instantly.  Roommate and I had a
good laugh.

The Oregonian had an op-ed the other day talking about how news
agencies are always stuck struggling with trying to figure out if they
should print Bush verbatim or fix his grammar and go for the word Bush
was trying to say when he says something not in the dictionary.
There's some press conferences the president holds that nobody gets
anything press-worthy from because the President just doesn't seem to
be able to make sense.

AOL 5.0.  I was doing tech support for Excite at Home at the time, and
there just didn't seem to be a way to use both an ethernet connection
and AOL for Broadband at the same time, ironically enough.

And fails to do so in a reasonable manner these days, which encourage
the stupid to make themselves glaringly obvious.

It's like bit.net but worse.  AOL is strong evidence that 26 million
Americans can be wrong.

Keep SSH on there and offer to log in and help out if there's a
problem?  Dialup with a real ISP is a snap:  Just make the PPP daemon
run persistently and use an external modem.  Then Grandpa only needs
to turn the modem on and wait a few seconds for the daemon to try the
modem again.  Be sure to install Patience, that'll give them more
Solitaire action than any human could ever need.

Try six or seven a day, all in a situation where AOL broke Windows (at
the very least networking and IE/OE, sometimes something nasty enough
I'd transfer them to Microsoft to let them take their $200/incident
support call/psychic network wannabe stab at it), times five days a
week, for a year.  And I was taking calls for Excite at Home.  I doubt
you've spoken to 1600+ AOL users, much less that many with the same
problem.  5.0 and 6.0 both broke Windows.  I only took about 3500
calls during my entire time taking calls for Excite at Home.

I think the definition of stupid is, "ignorant, but don't care."  This

more of "I am upset with them, so they are stupid in my opinion."  Maybe 
this is
why so much tech support went to India.  Are the Indians just plain

I wonder if AOL went open source tomorrow, if this would still be said?
Some ISP's have certainly oversold their products and the software they have
provided clearly had bugs.  I would guess that AOL as an alternative to MSN
failed more because it is an alternative than any other reason.  How many
businesses are afraid that any non Microsoft product is going to be
nonviable?  AOL may not be perfect, but at least something is
compeeting with MSN.  The race isn't over Internet service now, it's
over helping people see the Internet the way they want to see it.

Not really.  I occasionally get India when I'm making transfers at
work.  The new guys can be hard to understand and possibly won't
understand you unless you start trying for your best BBC accent, and
are frustrated from dealing with the dialect difference all day.

> I wonder if AOL went open source tomorrow, if this would still be said?

Yes.  The damage has been done, and it will take a long time to
overcome it.

I'd hardly call a tit a "scandal".  Sheesh.  It wasn't even displayed

And I'd hardly call increased censorship "a ripple [e]ffect in a positive

Well, when we're shooting them and putting them in prisons and deciding
how their nation should be run and by whom, well, we're clearly not
committed to their freedom.

OK.  But what does it take to show that these guys are guilty of just
plain lying whenever they like to suit the current spin?

Here's a really nice example of Rumsfeld just lying the way he always has,
but forgetting that this is 2004 and we actually have instant access to
prior records to show inconsistencies:

<URL: http://www.moveon.org/censure/caughtonvideo/ >

Man, I love that one.

These guys (and I mean everyone with the opportunity, really) have been
manipulating the press, particularly television, for years and getting
away with it.  Finally, the resources exist to prevent the large scale
fraud that has been perpetrated for the last several decades.

Jerry Mander, in his book _Four Arguments For The Elimination Of
Television_, describes one flaw of the medium as being an inability to
revise, research, and correct.  This particularly applies to live
broadcasts where information that is incorrect can be given by honest
mistake and taken as fact by the audience who might not be tuning in at
some later hour when the correction is issued.  (And unlike print media,
there is no public archive of corrections for later perusal.)  This has
led to certain public figures purposely giving false information to
television broadcasters for immediate effect knowing full well that it can
later be corrected or denied with very little risk of being challenged on
the spot.  Until very recently, it was common for a person interviewed on
television to simply say, "That's not what I said" and offer some
variation that cannot be challenged in the immediate context and therefore
will be considered truth by the majority of the viewers.

I can just imagine that Meet The Press (the source of the clip noted
above) has a team of folks sitting off-screen with tons of digital
transcriptions of interviews and press statements and conferences through
which they can grep and instantly queue to the interviewer for display.

This clip is a great example of that because it's clear, at first, that
the interviewer is surprised that Rumsfeld would deny Iraq was considered
an imminent threat, but then has evidence to contradict within seconds.

The technology is very powerful.  It's good to see it used as a force of
enlightenment once in a while.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0405080700150.6609@pecos.madboa.com>

It looks like some bot (spam or virus, I can't tell) is running
through the PLUG archives -- or someone who's infected is subscribed
to PLUG -- and lifting Message-Id headers for mail shenanigans.

I was combing through my mail log this morning when I saw a couple odd
entries:

  May  8 01:27:19 irvine sm-mta[12110]: i488RGXj012110:
  ruleset=check_rcpt,

  5.7.1 <pine.lnx.4.58.0404080417080.16338 at pecos.madboa.com>...
  Relaying denied. Proper authentication required.

  [...]

  May  8 04:19:52 irvine sm-mta[14153]: i48BJhXj014153:
  ruleset=check_rcpt,
  arg1=<pine.lnx.4.58.0404080417080.16338 at pecos.madboa.com>,

  denied. IP name lookup failed [69.111.40.185]

The "arg1=" entry indicated the intended addressee, but the wierd
thing is that it looks like a pine Message-Id header. The only
difference is that it's all lower-case characters; otherwise, it's a
dead ringer.

So I searched my sent-mail archives looking for that header. Bingo!:

Subject: [PLUG] debian discs won't mount
Message-ID: <409CFA05.8070509@brianquade.net>

I downloaded all of the debian 30r2 disc images and used cdrecord to 
burn the first image onto a disc.  I wanted to make sure that it 
recorded correctly before I boot from it, so I tried to mount it and 
look at what is on it.  But when I did a normal "mount /dev/scd0 
/mnt/cdrom", I got 4 lines of output, the first said that /dev/scd0 is 
an invalid argument, the second line said that the disc is read-only, 
the third line was the same as the first, and the fourth said that I 
must specify a filesystem type.  I used the Red Hat Hardware Browser and 
verified that /dev/scd0 is the correct device for the cdrom drive.  So I 
tried mounting again, this time giving it the command line option "-t 
iso9660" even though that is supposed to be the default.  This time it 
told me "wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/scd0, or too 
many mounted file systems".  I tried a different disc image and the same 
thing happened, so I don't think they got currupted in the download.  My 
/etc/filesystems looks okay.  Another disc that I burned mounts fine 
using the same mount command, so this has to be something with the 
debian disc image.  Has anyone else downloaded and burned cd images of 
debian 30r2?  What am I doing wrong?

AOL can't release their source code at this stage of the game.  There
are too many really really really old bugs that could be exploited if
the inner workings of AOL were released to the public.  AOL relies on
security through obscurity.  They are a *very* secret organization. 
I've never seen a company so unwilling to discuss their product.

All with the same problem?  No.  But 1600+?  Easily.  I was hitting
about 15/night a few years ago in the 'Get Help Now' forum on AOL (which
is no defunct) about four nights a week for about a year or so.

15 * 4 * 52 = 3120

The rest of the stuff I did on AOL was far less formalized than that.

Just so everyone is clear on this point, one of the conditions of using
Riverdale is that we can't do things for profit at the school. It is OK to
connect up with potential consultants - as Keith suggests - but not to
charge for work done on site at Riverdale.

I'm probably being overly careful here, but I don't want to mess up a good
thing. Riverdale has been a great place to hold Linux Clinics and we
really appreciate it.

I checked out the vscan site, but I couldn't determine whether it will
always bounce infected requests to the client, or whether it is able to
tag them and pass them on to a Web server.  Do you happen to know that?

I don't... I've never used squid-vscan before, I've just read about it

Yep. They were "the bomb" about 6 years ago.  If you had two they
would daisy-chain and do SLI (single-line interleave) which was
actually pretty nice (even with just one it was a very nice card,
IMHO).

Glide is the correct buzzword.  This is the howto I used years back to
get my voodoo2 working: (The linux 3dfx howto, available at many
places)

http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/xf3D/howto/3Dfx-HOWTO.html

Although, now there is a not that this howto is outdated, with some
links: "See glide.xxedgexx.com for more recent info, and use
news.3dfx.com for inquiries."

Russell is probably right in that you can ignore the voodoo card, and
go straight to the i740 (wire it that way--of course you won't get
acceleration off the voodoo, although the i740 does do "decent"
openGL for that time period).   You may also be able to leave the
voodoo patch cable in place and use the i740 directly.

If you do get it going, it should perform well enough to play some
semi-recent games (UT, for example, which has been ported).

I think Rob is doing everybody a service by pointing out that most of
what Michael says is nonsense.  The real danger is that just enough of
what he says give credence to the rest of what he says and he pronounces
with such authority that I'm sure many believe that he knows what he is
talking about, mostly he does not.

only an order of magnitude? no the information was completely wrong. 
Having just looked up the signaling specs for ethernet it looks like a
3.15V peak-to-peak for 100BaseT if that is signaled differenterly the
potential between the two conductors of a pair could be as much at
6.3V.  This is about TWO orders of magnitude less than the 300V you
mentioned, and the 300 you seem to think saves your answer is no where
is sight since the person who mentioned 300mV (three orders of
magnitude) said "more like" i.e. on the order of.

(Please note that my discussion of ethernet voltages is based on a very
quick search an may be way off on some of the details.  Also when
working on strange cabling be careful, phone lines use much the same
wiring as ether net and the ring voltage of a standard phone line can be
as much as 100V relative to earth, this can give you a nasty shock and
be quite harmeful if yo are holding the wire in your mouth standing in
barefeet in a pool of water...don't do that.  On the other hand 100V is
not anything like 300V)

Good point.  I will change the wording on my announcement webpage.  "If
you want to raise your fists (full of dollars), take it outside (the
school grounds)."  Note, I will need to inform Rick Lindahl and others
who might be bringing wifi stuff to sell;  we may need to set up some

to come prepared with the correct equipment.  Thanks for the correction,

Message-ID: <409f7604.15293559@mail.aracnet.com>

HI all,
Okay, in Mike's class we were trying to setup DNS to resolve to a
simple caching client/server so that we could dig locally and see it
find the other machines on my private network as well as show a
difference in time between getting and address from my ISP's domain
server and the then stored locally version that should be stored
locally in the cache. Nothing seems to work.
I can connect to my isp and get the correct info using:

dig www.pcc.edu

but it's not being stored locally.
I can do:

dig -x 127.0.0.1 and get proper reply

I can ping by IP on my closed network.

If I try dig -x 192.168.4.2 ( this is the IP address in my network of
the machine i'm doing the resolve/caching on)
I get error no server available.

I've attached my script file that shows this.

I'm unable to figure out why it's not working.

Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,
Harry

Subject: [PLUG] slackware download process????
Message-ID: <409E7E2D.5060508@brianquade.net>

I have been trying to figure out to download the current slackware 
distribution.  I read much of the documentation and am still confused.  
Every other time I download a cd installation, it comes in the form of 
an iso file that I just burn onto a disc.  But slackware has different 
kernels and options, so the documentation explains how to create the iso 
using mkisofs assuming I already have the whole directory structure (or 
just the files I need) on my machine.  But I can't find any 
documentation about how to download all of those files into the correct 
directories other than to create the directories by hand and then 
download each file by hand into the proper directory.  There must be a 
simpler way to do this.  The documentation also refers to a program 
called loadlin, but it is not very clear about whether loadlin is only 
for dos installs or if you can use it to install over an old 
(non-slackware) linux install or do a clean install.

Even to say that in absolute terms is inaccurate. There have been 3-wheel
automobiles manufactured, at least until the 1950s. (One manufacturer
of these gas-burning, street-legal tricycles was Morgan, headquartered
in England & I believe is currently the largest English-owned automobile
manufacturer in England -- they produce something less than 1000 units
in a year. ISTR there were others, but for reasons below I'm sure someone
will mention who they were.)

And IIRC, there are some versions of recumbent bicycles that have 3 wheels;
yes, they are properly called _tricycles_, but you'd just annoy people &
wear yourself out correcting this usage.

My point with these OT corrections is that is always hazardous to speak
of absolutes & certainties concerning any topic. I used to say that
``unique" & pregnancy are two absolute conditions -- you either are or you
aren't -- but personal experience has proven to me that it's possible to
be ``kinda" pregnant (Google on the term ``blighted ovum" for the details).

One of the few absolutes I would now count on now -- based on my experience
on Wikipedia -- is that in any sufficiently large enough group, while
there will be people who puff up their egos by expounding incorrect
knowledge, there will also be sharp minds that will correct this
misinformation, thus deflating these egos. Unfortunately, some of these
inflated egos prove to have armoring, & prove immune to the constant
corrections.

Geoff

PS -- Rereading the above, it occurs to me that some people here may
think I'm talking about them: as I said, all of my examples concerning
inflated egos & their armoring come from Wikipedia; so if the shoe fits,
I wouldn't advertise it.

  I have the 4-cd-rom set for -9.1 and you're welcome to copies. My
preference is to support Patrick and his elves so I'm on the subscription
service. But, the distribution is certainly available to be copied.

  If you're installing on a workstation/server then you'll probably want the
ide kernel. If you're installing on a portable with pcmcia support (e.g.,
for an external cd-rom drive) then you'll want that one, too.

 Loadlin is used to boot linux from a DOS system. You don't need it. You
also don't need rawwrite if you're working on a linux box.

  I have found Slackware to be very easy and clean to install over a prior
(RH 7.3) distribution and on brand-new machines. Oh, ... I also installed it
over a libranet installation.

  Will you be at next Saturday's WiFi Clinic? I can bring the cd-roms or I
can burn a set and bring them.

Subject: [PLUG] cabling help
Message-ID: <BAY9-F199ep4Tau1g8m0001859e@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I am in a small building that has a pre-built cat5e network.  All jacks
and wires are cat5e which transmits both voice and data.
At the patch panel (with cat5e connectors), I need to add a phone unit that
has nothing but RJ11 connectors.
So I am in need of a coupler/connector/conversion module that
connect cat5e cable (RJ-45 head) to RJ11 jacks.

I went to Fry's this afternoon and they don't have anything like that.
My best solution for now is to go and figure out how to make a custom
cable that RJ11 on one side and RJ45 on the other.

Short from doing that, does anyone has a better solution for me?  There
might be things that I don't know of so I thought I ask all the gurus on 
this list
before I go get books on RJ11 and RJ45 wiring diagrams.

thanks

Hi ,
Yes, bind is up and running, so is named, I can run rndc and make
checks as well.
As I said, when I run the dig command against the loopback it performs
correctly.
I can log on to my ISP and dig finds the NS's and brings back the
info.
However, something is not caching that info locally and I'm unable to
find where to make a change in order for it to do that.
If I could figure out how to set it to caching the info locally I
think that would do the trick.
Thanks,
Harry

  Check with the owner of Oregon Electronics on NE 10th and Couch. If he
doesn't have a computer cable he can make one. I highly recommend him.

I don't know of any converters.
The custom cable sounds like the better idea as long as the cat-5 is
wired to standard.
You'd only need a 2 or 3 foot long patch cable to make the patch on
the patch panel.

Maybe I'm not clear on the question, but RJ-45 female plugs are designed
to accomodate RJ-11 male plugs.

Yes you are right.  But I want to connect between a cat5e cable and an RJ11
jack.  RJ11 jack is too small for the cat5e cable.
To get to all the wall jacks, voice signals are sent through these cat5e 
cables.

There are slackware iso's available.  You can go to slackware.com and 
click on 'get slack' for a list of mirrors.

http://slackware.com/getslack/

or if you can not find what you need there, you can use a google search 
and pull up something like this.

http://ftp.man.olsztyn.pl/pub/linux/distributions/slackware/slackware-9.1-iso/

If you do this however, I still recommend using the md5 checksums from 
slackware.com to insure you have the correct image. Hope this helps.

To get a response to this query, you would need to set up a
reverse-lookup zone file in /etc/bind for your private network.

The program bind knows nothing about what is in the hosts file, it only

To test for caching, it seems to me that you would need to track down
where the cache is being stored.  Although, I suppose you could do
something like "dig www.google.com @192.168.4.2" then (if you get an
appropriate response) you could unplug your gateway and try the same
command again.  If the resolver is caching, you will get the same
response, if it is not, you should get a "no server available" error.

Good Luck,

Randall,

  You might consider tightening the range of possibilities somewhat. Are you
looking at application development, SysAdmin service provisions, starting an
ISP or training company?

Just curious,

Cat5e is a cable spec, it defines the electrical and signal
specifications of the cable, not the signal assignments.  There are a
number of specs for the signal assignments, but mostly these juts defone
the pairs, you will need to know which wireing spec and which pair the
phone circut is on.

Ok, I now have Debian (or Deviant as my fingers keep trying to say) 
installed on my IBM T21.  It was actually a piece of cake once I decided 
to use the boot floppies instead of the CD-Rom.  I hooked up to the 
Oregon State ftp site and installed the unstable version because it fits 
my personality.  Since I believe that sleep is vastly over rated, I 
finished last nite, or early this morning, including xwindows, wmaker, 
synaptic, kde, gde and mozilla.  When I finish playing with it a home 
I'll bring it to work and try to hack to the IP address which was left 
open for me to bypass the Sonicwall Firewall appliance which requires 
McAfee Antivirus to be installed.

Which brings me to my issue.  I'm not thrilled with the screen 
appearance and I think its because I didn't get an option for 24 color 
1024x768 screen.  I got higher and lower but not that.  I tried to edit 
/etc/x11/xfree86config-4 using the kde editor which allegedly writes in 
text.  It kept telling me I couldn't write (copy over the existing file) 
and to check my rights or that the 20gb hard drive was full.  I suspect 
that I'm missing something here.  I'm willing to edit files, including  
/etc/network/interfaces but I'm afraid I'm missing some simple, stupid step.

Any hints,

Thanks,

	You must edit this file as root. Either start the KDE editor as
root, (probably not a good idea,) or drop to a shell, su to root, and edit
the file using vim. (or emacs, as the preference may dictate.)

Let's hold up here for just a second... are you burning an ISO file onto
a disk as a file or as an image?  You need to burn it as an image... if
you mount the CD and do an ls, you should see many files, not just an
ISO file.  :-)

AFAIK, you should be able to boot most of the kernels from Pat's default
CD.  Do you think you'll need a funky kernel?  Those CD making
instructions are simply to help you make an ISO out of a set of files if
you need to do something funky.

And to get them all, download the whole directory tree.  Most ftp
utilities out there more advanced than the commandline 'ftp' are able to
handle this.  I'm not sure, but I think 
wget ftp://ftp.scarlet.be/pub/slackware/slackware-9.1/ will do the
trick.

Those instructions are up there for people trying to install Slackware
on ultra-low-memory boxes, essentially.  We're talking like 5MB of
RAM... where the initrd is too big.  :-)

As Rich stated, loadlin only works with DOS and really, you don't need
to worry about it.

As Rich said... just pop in the CD and use the default ide kernel, you
should be good to go.  :-)

  Excellent insight, Rob. What our friend needs to do is read the man page
for 'cdrecord' and use that to burn the ISO images onto the cd-r disks. I
didn't see that the writing mechanism might have been incorrect.

  However, disks are still available if needed. But, I think you'll find
True Happiness with your downloaded ISOs and cdrecord.

Subject: [PLUG] Shared Address Books
Message-ID: <1084235176.29788.95.camel@localhost>

Hey list-

I've wanted to implement something for a while here on my home network,
I just haven't gotten around to looking at *how* to implement it until
recently.  I can't find anything that explains how to deal with shared
address books like what I'm looking for.  :-\

I'd like to start storing address books on my server in such a manner
that regardless of the email program I'm using, I can access my address
book much as I access my email (imaps).  At first, I thought LDAP was
the way to go for this... I went so far as to set up openldap (which
didn't want to compile on my old server box) before it really started to
look like it wouldn't do the trick.  Sure, it could provide a
server-side address book for me, but that book would be shared among all
the users of my server and would, by and large, be read-only.

So is there such a thing out there?  Or is it a pipe dream to be able to
share a single address book between Thunderbird or lookOut Express when
I'm using somebody else's computer, SquirrelMail when I'm on a public
computer, and Evolution or KMail here on my baby?

Surely the idea has been discussed before...  :-)

Both of those editors can be scary at first. If you can't be bothered to

  D'accord. If you ever used WordStar and any other editor that uses the
ctrl-<key> shortcuts, joe will be really easy to use. It's small, fast and
great for small jobs. Given all that, I still prefer emacs for coding.

Mike,

You need to setup X for kde, gde, or mozilla.

If you are using a earlier RedHat distro, there is Xconfigurator.
Later ones have xf86config, maybe other distros have this because it
is from XFree86.org.

When X is setup.  Start the X windowing system by issuing:
startx.

Or you could have the system startup in X by editing /etc/inittab or by
answering yes in Xconfigurator when it asks for startup option.

I read that you've got X configured somewhat... if you want X to start
automatically when the machine boots (as I do), then you will want to
install a "display manager" to manage graphical logins.

I like gdm, but there is also kdm and xdm.  Only install one.

(If you install gdm, be sure to go into "configure greeter" and change to
the graphical greeter and set it so that system functions can be done
without the root password.  That way, the system can be shutdown from the
gdm greeter without having to type a password.

OK, maybe that's just my biases coming through.

Well, the first thing to do is not run it.

How is it getting started?  How are you starting X?

This is one of those places where the configurability and customizability
of GNU/Linux systems gets to be a hinderance.  There are so many ways you
could be doing this, telling you how to undo it isn't exactly
straightforward.

If you're running a display manager (xdm, gdm, kdm), then usually the
display manager will let you choose which session manager or window
manager you'll be using (kde, gnome, enlightenment, windowmaker, etc.).
Start up with something other than KDE.

If you're starting X with startx from the command line, then you probably
have something in your ~/.xsession file that is starting KDE.  Modify that
to start something else.  You can change it to gnome-session, maybe.

After that, you have to run aptitude (or synaptic or dselect or whatever
makes you happy) and remove all the KDE stuff.  The easiest way I've found
is to remove everything that says kdelib, kdebin, kde-lib, kde-bin, etc.
That will remove the required libraries and apt will remove all the
applications depending on those libraries.  It's a start, anyway.

While metapackages are really nice for installing large collections of
packages, there's no commensurate way of removing large collections except
by finding the common dependency and removing that.

Hey.

I think I have a situation where my web designer has flaked on me.  If you
are good with css, have a couple of good looking sites under your belt,
know your way around the gimp (or Photoshop, if you must), and can work
for relatively cheap (how cheap?  We'll talk about it), then I have a
project for you.  One of several.

I'm the administrator for a group of websites that all desperately need to
look better.  One of them is an ecommerce site that is about to launch and
needs to have a new look created essentially from scratch (though within
the framework of the catalog/shopping cart application that is running).

This is all project-based, 1099-style contract work.  We're looking at
quick and dirty (but looking clean...ish).  If this is something you can
bust out in a day or two, the pay will be pretty good.

There will certainly be future work.

Immediate response, if possible.

Thanks.

Then you must have selected a monitor that doesn't support 1024x768. 
Try selecting a different monitor, or use the medium setting for monitor
selection, and select 1024x768 @ 60 Hz, your lap-top should be capable
of that.

Good Luck,

OpenLDAP needn't be read-only, though I'll admit that easy-to-use GUI
clients aren't exactly easy to come by.

If you can set up your local users with passwords in your LDAP
database, then there are a few GUI clients that'll allow folks to
connect and alter records. GQ (a gtk+ app) is my favorite:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/gqclient/

I haven't installed phpLDAPadmin, but it looks pretty full-featured:

I know that Jim McQuillan of ltsp.org is doing all he can.  He was a SCO 
guy before Linux came along.

Subject: [PLUG] Extracting files from an incremental tar backup
Message-ID: <1084302956.14443.3.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Anybody know how to extract/restore files from incremental tar backups
created using the -g switch?  I haven't destroyed my system or anything,
but I am curious how to get the files out.  Obviously there is an
initial tar file which is a full backup, and then a series of
incremental files created using the incremental backup file from the
first operation.

Any help appreciated!

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0405111413210.14572@neon.netpro.to>

Any LWP gurus out there?
I'm trying to debug a problem I'm having with LWP and I'd like to view the
POST data that is being sent to the web server.  I've included the
following:

use LWP::Debug qw(+);
use LWP::Debug qw(conns); conns('+');

According to the LWP::Debug manpage, the "conns" function is supposed to
"show all data transfered over the connections".  I'm just not sure how to
make conns actually do that...
Thanks,
~M

Is it possible to view the same Linux desktop that I use locally by using

Yes. It is possible. I would suggest a different approach to achieve the same result. I would use XDMCP to login graphically and start an x session. Are you connecting to the linux box from a windows or linux machine?

Ideally, I'd like to be able to connect from both.  So would using XDMCP
give me the same session remotely as when I'm physically sitting at the
computer?
I want to be able to work on my computer, wander off, get on another
computer and access my original computer and everything I was previously
doing.

In either case, VNC or XDMCP, you would be starting a new session, so you would not see the windows that are currently open for the user that is logged in locally. I guess I misunderstood your question.

I'm no LWP Guru, but perldoc LWP::Debug says that the functions are only
used within the library. So maybe you should look for something else for
this function.

You could always just print the data before you POST it.

Right, but I'm trying to see what the problem is between LWP and the
server.  If I use curl then everything works as it should.  Mozilla works
as it should and I can see that things are passed correctly when I use the
Mozilla HTTP Live Headers plugin.  There's just something screwy that LWP
is doing with the POST that breaks things for certain specific cases...

The graphical suggestions are good IF you can afford the time, hassle, 
and politics of putting the special client (er, server, depending on 
what flavor) on the remote machine.

On the other hand, for those of you who can live without the graphics, 
"screen" is the niftiest program ever, supporting all kinds of stuff 
like detaching and reattaching, scrollback buffers in each of multiple 
windows, split-screen, and intelligent key bindings that don't conflict 
much with other apps' magic keys.  And all you need is a VT100 (emulator).

Not enough people use or know about screen, but even if you never use 
the multiple virtual window capability, it's worth using screen within 
the window for all your terminal sessions in case you get booted -- you 
can always reattach to the screen and have your process happily waiting 
for you.

Hi Linux UG Leader,

We're looking for GNOME hacks for our upcoming book, "Linux Desktop
Hacks." We already have half of the book filled with KDE hacks, but no
GNOME hacks! Do you know of any GNOME Hackers who could help us out?
Please forward this email along.

If you have a hack to share, please send 'em our way by having your 
members email me (marsee at oreilly.com) with "GNOME hacks" in the subject

As thanks for sharing, we'll make sure to get copies of "Linux Desktop

As most of you know, O'Reilly's Open Source Convention is in Portland
again this year.

If you can find money to attend or you can get your employer to spring
for the bill, I recommend attending.  And to make things better,
O'Reilly is offering a good discount to locals - which I assume means
any member of any of the LUGs in Oregon and Southwest Washington - AND
of course, you all know how you can become a member of PLUG or MWVLUG or 
ELUG.  (We all have real tight membership rules.  You must be willing to 
say you are a member.)

Complete information about O'Reilly's discount program follows this 
posting.

                                          Sincerely,
                                          David Mandel

   P.S.  PLUG is talking to O'Reilly about providing them with
   volunteers like we did last year - but PLEASE don't regard this as
   a cheap alternative to paying to attend.  We like having the 
   conference in Portland and want to see O'Reilly do well on the
   conference.  I hope we can get some volunteer positions for people,
   but only for people who can not afford to attend normally.

Message-ID: <BAY9-F53GJ2TUSzbAUf0001ebd9@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I am using Mozilla 1.6 and just download the latest J2SDK from Java.
When trying to setup the java plugin, I simply
create a symlink from mozilla/plugin to the ns610/libjava plugin
that comes with the Java JRE/SDK package.
When I invoke Mozilla, it would crash and give this message:

----------
INTERNAL ERROR on Browser End: No manager for initializing factory?

  System error?:: Success
----------

If I remove the symlink, mozilla would start again just fine.
Pretty odd.  Did I miss a step besides creating the symlink?

Thanks

--Vincent

For anybody who didn't want to dig around their website to locate prices
real quick, as I didn't get a good idea of what kind of range we were
talking about from this email, here are some of them:

Day pass - $425
Convention Sessions - $895 early bird, $1095 standard
Exhibit hall plus keynote and BOF - $50 early bird, $75 standard

AFAICT, the fee reduction is 25% for being local, although I could be
mistaken there.

Is this "Open Source" Convention for corporate folks or ordinary people?
Probably I should think twice before buying any of O'Reilly books from now on.

O'Reilly is a for-profit company. No one, from Tim on down, has ever
been anything less than forthcoming about that. The convention is
being held at a major hotel, and all the speakers are presumably being
paid and having their travel expenses covered. O'Reilly has at least
eight employees whose salaries are funded to some extent from
conference proceeds.

So, yeah, O'Reilly, the speakers, and the hotel are all making money
on this thing. Does that really call into question the integrity of
O'Reilly publications? Do *you* work for free?

There's HTTP::Proxy, that can sit in between your post and the

The problem is creating the symlink to the wrong version of the
plugin.  The Mozilla 1.6 binary is compiled with gcc 3.2 and the Java
plugin needs to use the same compiler version.  The gcc 3.2 compiled
version should be in the ns610-gcc32 directory.

I would guess based on those prices that they're targetting people with
outside funding who need to learn some of the topics quickly.  "Ordinary
people" with more time than money would be better off learning from less
costly sources (e.g. books, FAQs, mailing lists, etc.)

Charging for the exhibit hall seems a bit excessive, though.  At most
conferences I've seen this is free for anyone who would have a strong
interest and can make the trip.

I find the idea very intriguing.  Perhaps I imagined it hearing about it,
but it seems that there should be a provision for whitelisting certain
servers inbound, therefore removing the computational requirement.  In
other words, only unfamiliar or infrequent SMTP servers would be required
to perform the computation tax.

While the proposed solution would probably work great for my tiny system
with a low volume of traffic- what about a small ISP that receives tens of
thousands of emails a day?  This computational tax is pushed onto the
sender of email, does it cause any corresponding work to be performed by
the receiver, ie, figuring out the expected solution?  How would that
work?

A few comments...

At a penny per email, most of us would likely be spending more than a
few bucks a year in addition to our ISP fees.  PLUG would need to start
advertising.  The LKML would need to start charging membership fees. 
Yahoo!'s groups program would implode and go bankrupt in about three
days.  Windows users would all be locked up for not paying their bills
when they got the latest worm.

The email computation scheme seems, to me, to be a bit nutso.  When a
mail server receives an email, be it from another mail server or from a
user, what does it do?  Quite often, it turns around and talks to
another mail server.  If you add 10 seconds worth of CPU time in there,
AOL is going to find they need to buy a skyscraper worth of blade
servers to keep up with the added CPU time.

Sure, they could specify only when non-servers connect to them do they
request the computation (and then, what, compute on a per-recipient
sliding scale?), but then they need to find a scheme to identify servers
instead of clients, since in SMTP talk they're all the same.

Naw, I don't think either of those schemes will fly nor will they work. 
Hunt down the root causes of spam... those who actually make the money
off of it... or keep filtering with more and more advanced spamassassin
rules, but don't charge me a penny or ten seconds of CPU time per email,
that's just nuts.

My two cents worth.  Oops, I guess that's three cents now.  Plus at
least a few dollars for the poor ol' PLUG server that turns this email
into a few hundred more emails....

This is the "convention space costs money" insanity, and the "employees
who set up conventions need to get paid" insanity.  This is not at all
out of line for professional conventions, and this convention in particular
is NOT run by volunteers.  A similar volunteer-operated conference I attend
yearly costs $700, for example.  I know they comp at least some of the
speakers.  O'Reilly does turn a small profit on this - though they lost
money as a whole last year.   

If you cannot afford more, I would suggest paying $37.50 (w plug
discount) for the exhibits.  Plenty of good things to see, and good
folks to talk to, and the keynotes are plentiful and fascinating.

This is a professional conference.  I am considering purchasing a full
conference ticket, even though I'm not a professional in this field.
While not exactly a bargain, attendees get good value for money, and
O'Reilly is not gouging.  If it is not worth it to you, don't go.  If
you think conferences should be cheaper, set up one of your own.

IIRC, we were able to get in to the exhibit hall for free last year.
I believe this was through a combination of early registration and
the user's group discount.

I should have included the cost for *just* the exhibition hall *without*
any speakers... which *is* free.

Nice to see I'm not the only one usually too lazy to click on a link.

Message-ID: <20040512172245.GA28001@gate.kl-ic.com>

Attendees of the Linux Wifi clinic next Saturday, May 15:

Bestbuy is having a Linksys sale again;  WRT54G B+G router, $90,
BEFW11S4 B router, $50.  A Linksys mail-in rebate takes $10 off
that price.

We will be focusing on 802.11B at the clinic, but the WRT54G can
be configured for B only. The WRT54G runs Linux so people are
doing wonderful firmware hacks on it.  Be sure to get the Version
2.0 unit, which is labelled "Version 1.1" on the box, but has serial
numbers starting with CDF5.... in little lettering on the bottom of
the box. Serial Numbers CDF4... and lower are earlier versions and not
suitable, these are probably flushed out of the retail channel by now.

There is also a new WRT54GS Speedbooster version, which may prove even
better for hacking someday, but isn't getting much attention yet;  you
probably want to purchase the plain WRT54G.

The local folks ( http://www.portless.net/ewrt/ ) that are doing the
EWRT firmware hack also have a local source of the WRT54G units at $80.

See you all Saturday at 11am!  http://www.keithl.com/linwifi

***Eclipse
Publisher: O'Reilly
ISBN: 0596006411
"Eclipse" is a fast-track approach to mastery of Eclipse. It's a tightly
focused book that examines all aspects of Eclipse: the menus, preferences,
views, perspectives, editors, team, and debugging methods, and how they're
used every day by thousands of developers. Eclipse covers hundreds of
techniques, from the most basic Java development to creating your own
plugin editors for the Eclipse environment. Development of practical
skills is emphasized with dozens of hands-on examples that get down to
business.

***Learning Red Hat Enterprise Linux & Fedora, 4th Edition
Publisher: O'Reilly
ISBN: 059600589X
This book provides a clear, no-nonsense introduction to the Red Hat
distribution of Linux. It takes you through installation and shows you the
key parts of the system, always with an eye toward what can go wrong and
what you need to know to get over the humps. New in this edition are
installation instructions and package updating for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux and Fedora, and information on the GRUB bootloader and the CUPS
printer system.

***WarDriving: Drive, Detect, Defend
Publisher: Syngress
ISBN: 1931836035
This book educates users of wireless networks as well as those who run the
networks about the insecurities associated with wireless networking. This
effort is called WarDriving. In order to successfully WarDrive there are
hardware and software tools required. This book covers those tools, along
with cost estimates and recommendations. Since there are hundreds of
possible configurations that can be used for WarDriving, some of the most
popular are presented to help readers decide what to buy for their own
WarDriving setup. Many of the tools that a WarDriver uses are the same
tools that could be used by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a
wireless network. Since this is not the goal of a WarDriver, the
methodology that users can use to ethically WarDrive is presented. In
addition, complete coverage of WarDriving applications, such as
NetStumbler, MiniStumbler, and Kismet, are covered.

Yeah... I like GUI-ness for my emailing.  :-)

Good enough, but not as good as it gets, I dare say.  :-)

I like Evolution... it's bloated and slow as hell, but it sure is purdy.

And, FWIW, gnome-terminal supports clicking of links when using
text-mode email clients, as well.  I'll bet mutt with some mouse support
supports clicking of links, too.  I know slrn does for usenet...

Subject: Home Networking Annoyances Needed for New Book

Dear User Group Leader:

Once again, I must say thanks for the great response to our previous 
calls for annoyances, gripes, and complaints about Excel, and the Internet,
and other topics. The email we received was useful and gave our
Annoyances books a great head start.

As you might guess, we have yet another book in the wings--this one
focusing on home networking annoyances. Everything from cabling hassles to
setting up a router to wireless access points to fussing with TCP/IP
settings to installing a shared printer. Whether you've set up a wired
(Ethernet, phoneline, or powerline) or wireless (802.11a, b, or g)
network, merely shared a DSL line, or networked a bunch of PCs and Macs,
feel free to share the annoyances you've encountered along the way.

If you or any members of your group have home networking annoyances 
you'd like to see solved, email marsee at oreilly.com with "Home Networking
Annoyances" in the subject line. Please note what hardware, software,
and/or service is giving you grief (e.g.: a LinkSys Cable/DSL Router with
4-Port Switch, SMC's EtherPower II network cards, SBC DSL, Windows XP,
etc.).

As thanks for sharing, we'll make sure to get copies of "Home Networking
Annoyances" sent to your group shortly after publication.


--Marsee



***

An example:

The Annoyance:
I added a new computer to my network, but it doesn't appear in My Network
Places or Network Neighborhood on any of the other computers. The Windows
help files tell you to reboot all the other computers on the network in
order to see the new computer, but there's got to be a better way!

The Fix:
There is. Assuming your hardware connections are working, and you've
created at least one shared resource on the new computer, you don't have
to reboot the rest of the network to see the new computer.

Wait twelve minutes. Honest. Could I make that up? Get a cup of coffee,
empty the dishwasher, or change all the burned out light bulbs in the
house. Then open the network folder again, or press F5 to refresh the
display if you didn't close the folder. You should now see the new
computer.

Why does this happen? The icons in the network folders (My Network Places
and Network Neighborhood) are controlled by a service called the Computer
Browser Service, which browses the network, peers down the pipes
(including the virtual pipes of wireless connections), and checks to see
who's on board. In a peer-to-peer network, the computers elect one of
their own as a browser master using a complicated scheme that involves a
private conversation among the computers (held secretly so you aren't
aware of it and can't control or interfere with it). The browser master
runs the browser service every twelve minutes, and populates the network
folders of all computers on the network with icons representing the
computers it finds.

Already mentioned as deadly for list servers and ISPs that handle
thousands or millions of non-spam messages a day.

A nastier problem is the spam zombies. An awful lot of spam is now
originating from windows boxes that have been cracked. Some crackers are
selling the computing power (in this case spam power) they have at their
disposal. Spammers will once again not pay for the cost of their garbage.

Ethereal to the rescue.  Thanks, Randal.
The character '??' needs to be encoded as '%FC' when sent to the server.
If I send the '??' in my LWP POST then it's encoded as '%C3%BC'.
If I instead send the '%FC' in my LWP POST then it's encoded as '%25FC'.
It would be nice if I could somehow turn off any LWP encoding of the POST
altogether.  Maybe this is possible?

So then I added "use utf8" to my script and the POST is encoded correctly,
but it's broken several parts of my script and caused lots of strange
behavior.  Sigh...

It's an idea that was proposed and discounted some time ago. The major problem
is that a large percentage of the spam is relayed through virus-infected
systems, so the spammers still won't pay the cost - the computational effort
will take place on infected home computers, penalizing innocent victims
who would have no clue why their systems are so slow. And it puts an 
unreasonable burden on legitimate servers that happen to process large
volumes of email.

First of all - Have you ever seen a vendor who charges potential customers for 
demonstration of his products? 
Have you ever seen a car dealer who ask you to pay for a test drive?
Why don't you pay for every sales pitch?  
O'Reilly in this sense is no different than any other vendor who strives for 
your business. All this fluff and bluff like five star hotels and speakers 
are the vendor's business expenses not his customers'.
I'm not working for free but nether I'm asking for an additional pay every 
time I demonstrate completed projects to my customers.

  There is apparently major differences between Fedora on one side and (at
least) Slackware and Debian on the other side in the ability of the hotplug
system to load firmware.agent. At least with the 3Com 3CRWE154G72; but since
it involves loading the firmware via firmware.agent I suspect the card brand
and model don't matter.

  After many hours of working on this with excellent local help I asked
EmperorLinux to look into the problem. They confirmed that the problem
exists with at least slackware and debian but works with their default
fedora loads.

  Something to consider germane to Saturday's clinic.

They are old ideas.  The "digital puzzle" is the same as the "hash cash"
proposal on the Cypherpunks list years ago.

If put into use, it will kill almost all mailing lists.  (It becomes too
expensive to send bulk mail.)

You cannot whitelist because most people do not control the servers
their mail goes through.

The only way to slow down spam is to break the kneecaps of spammers.

You could probably write an easy Java library to connect to the clamav
daemon and send data over to it from within your application.

[Hash-cash approach]

Problem 1: Users of low-powered systems.  Problem 2: Users of shared
hosts.  Problem 3: Mailing lists.  Problem 4: Addressing problems 1-3
opens loopholes for spammers.

Heh.  I'm mighty tempted to snail-mail Discover a copy of:
  http://www.craphound.com/spamsolutions.txt
with appropriate boxes checked.  

I'm really surprised there hasn't been much coverage of the Windows
spam-zombie-virus problem.  You'd think Dave Barry would jump to write a
column with imagery like that.

Meantime, I've finally enabled SpamAssassin on my hosted box.  
Works like effin' magic.

Eh? I'm not familiar with many Java acronyms. No, I was thinking more
like, it has a defined protocol that listens to UNIX or TCP sockets,
both of which I'm sure you can "do" in Java rather easily. :-) So your
program has volatile data, it connects to clamd, sends the data, asks
clamd a question, disconnects, and then acts on the answer.

I'm not a lawyer, and definitely am not an ACLU fan, but I read an
article by an ACLU goon a few months ago (which I have since thrown away
when cleaning out old papers) that outlined this.  As I recall, it
stated you are allowed, by law, to view personal emails stored on a
system, but *not* personal emails traveling *through* a system.

Again, IANAL and I really don't remember the whole thing for sure.  But
Google might be able to locate the article for you.

Just a word of warning. There may be state laws that apply beyond what is
allowed or disallowed under Federal law.

There may also be distinctions between mail on your employer's mail 
server vs. on your personal ISP's mail server. Generally employers are less
restricted when it comes to monitoring employee communications compared
to other situations. This again may vary from state to state.

In other words it can get complicated. Ask a lawyer if the answer really
matters.

  A student did a project using this sort of approach and it made it all the
way to the International Science and Engineering Fair finals. I've no idea
how it was judged.

  If you can, visit the ISEF tomorrow morning 9:00am-noon at the Convention
Center. Some amazing projects there, including a robot built from the toy
construction set (forget the name; uses thin dowels and round hubs with
holes around the rim) that solves the Rubic's Cube. Many neat CS projects as
well as mathemtics, engineering, environmental science, zoology and other
subjects.

I would be surprised to find that you could argue for presumption of privacy
if you send messages in clear text over a public network.
Maybe the same rules apply as for the phone network, but the Internet is
much more public and much less controlled than the phone network.

Probably no "reasonable expectation of privacy" if email placed in a 
known unsecure system.  Unlike placing a letter in a sealed envelope in 
the US mail where its a federal crime to intercept or open.  That said, 
if the answer is important enough to bet a few C notes, hire an 
intellectual property guy and get an answer with an insurance policy 
behind it.

The "summary" answers you get here come with no warranty or probability 
of accuracy and are worth about what you pay for them.

Message-ID: <40A469D9.3090405@robinson-west.com>

Going through Postfix's site after implementing graylisting,
I've run into something referred to as SPF.  Apparently, the
idea is to query DNS TXT records where the valid sending
source for a domain's mail will be listed.  I'm probably
oversimplifying this, but so far this is how I understand it.

The idea then is to look up whether or not the indicated
hostname in a message coming in is in fact one that that
appropriate domain server lists a matching ip address for.

The part about SPF that has me confused is why it requires
the use of SASL or why SASL is being pushed.

How can SPF make it possible to know for sure that any
email message is coming from the source indicated in it's
header?

Is SPF a fully developed approach to shutting down mail
forging, or is it still experimental?

This idea of pressuring anti-spam technologies onto the
Internet, will hobbyist's get sued for noncompliance?  

If someone can patent an idea and sue everyone using
it, what's to stop SPF, or any other technique, from
getting patented and charged for?

As far as denial of service if too many DNS requests
for the TXT records SPF is based on, how much of
a problem could that be?  I get hundreds of junk mail
attempts a day where the domains chosen do seem to
be pulled out of thin air.  The sitenames used probably
have nothing to do with where this mail comes from.

The site of interest is http://spf.pobox.com

The only way to slow down spam is to reduce the economic profitability
of it.  More effective marketing of spam products in other venues
reduces the available customer base.  Incomplete/invalid/fraudulent
transactions against vendors who use spam (and who cannot seek recompense
by legal means) can drive up their cost of sales to unsustainability. 
Focus on the transactions, not on the email.  Cause them to lose their
credit-card merchant accounts.   Anyone want to write a "buy-bot"?  Do
landfills take deliveries?  Or do we just deliver the misrouted goods
to other spammers?

Of course, for the fraud-peddler spammers there is always Mugu baiting
( i.e. http://baita.mugu.co.uk ) and variants.  In some cases, mugus
have been led towards jail or even murdered by crime syndicates, so
this works too.

So, after the spammers, are penniless, ostracised, jailed, or worse,
THEN you can break their kneecaps.

Hmm, couldn't we all avoid reading spam by having our smtp servers 
deliver the
headers to us before the messages themselves for our inspection? 

This doesn't stop spam, but it could save someone the trouble of reading 
it.  

If you delete the header message, that means that the message on hold is 
spam.
Given a certain timeout, that message can be discarded.  Alternatively, 
you could
write spam in the body of a reply to a header email and the server could 
parse
that reply using perl, etc.

Any tips on how to implement my, "you don't have to read a message you don't
trust," idea using Postfix-2.1.1?  It seems like I can easily hook a 
perl script to
Postfix, guess I just need to learn how to trigger hold and sender must 
be on a
whitelist.

I'm not following you here. I've only attended two O'Reilly 
conferences (1999 in Monterey, and last year here in Portland), but I 
wouldn't characterize the sessions as demos or sales pitches. Some 
speakers were better than others, of course, but none of them used 
their presentation time to sell a book.

Anyone who'd confuse the Portland Mariott with a five-star hotel 
either has not visited a five-star hotel or owns stock in Mariott. :-)

Seriously, however, the argument about expenses was mine, not 
O'Reilly's. I was just trying to point out that there are plenty of 
legitimate expenses to consider when evaluating the price of a 
conference.

Admittedly, business-oriented technical conferences aren't cheap. 
SANS, LISA, and the rest of them are out of my budget reach. I wish it 
weren't so, but I'm not going to call O'Reilly's reputation into 
question for trying to compete in that marketplace.

Actually, acronyms have to be speakable words.  JNI is an abbreviation

Hi All,

I am planning on attending the clinic, and am wondering if anyone would
like a copy of my modified Gibraltar OS.  This is an industrial grade
firewall/access point that can be installed on anything that will boot
to CD-ROM and has 64 Megs of RAM.  It can also use USB thumb drives,
floppy drives, or hard drives for storing the configuration that is
automatically loaded during boot.

A show of hands, and I'll try to burn as many as wanted.

Thanks,

I'm aware of the site, thanks, but I'd no intention of a formal research

Michael,

Did you miss the L-O-N-G thread on here (what, last month, month 
before??) about SPF records? Most likely, it's archived by now. If 
nothing else, it's probably cataloged by google.

OK, do you NOT get Linux Journal, that had a very informative article 
about SPF records and how to implement them in a two part article in the 
April and May issues?

Either way, rather than asking questions that are answered with simple 
(and I mean simple) searches via google, you should go to google.

I'm NOT trying to talk down to you, or to put you down in any way, shape 
or form.

I'm simply pointing out that many of the questions you ask are already 
answered, and you'd save time and much bandwidth by looking for the 
answer instead of making someone else look for it for you.

Well, the truth is, is doesn't. Nothing does with 100 percent accuracy.

BUT, what is the likelihood that someone is going to spoof both the name 
AND ip address of a valid mail server, in spam?

The name is easy. The IP is harder.

Looked pretty developed to me in the LJ articles. Enough so that 
multiple MTAs support it.

Not a question anyone here can answer with authority. Ask a patent lawyer.

Why would it be any different than anything else? The DNS does one 
query, caches it, and then does another query when the TTL runs out. 
Usually a couple of days or more later.

Probably. And for those, the SPF record doesn't exist, so it's tagged as 
unknown. The system can't tell if it's forged or not. Only if the domain 
exists, and an SPF record exists can the system say if it believes the 
mail to be spoofed or legit. All other cases default to unknown.

Much harder, and since the SPF information is stored in the DNS along
with MX and the rest of the domain information, you can do a name <-> IP
check and be reasonably sure that the MTA giving you the mail is one
that is allowed by the SPF header.

Depends on what you mean by "fully developed."  There a couple caveats
for using it for your own domains for roaming users and the like, but
it's significantly more reasonable and implementable than competing
proposals.  The only major problem with it is that in order for it to be
effective, it requires large-scale adoption.  But that's a problem for
all of the competing proposals.  Another minor issue is that one of the
biggest spam problems (Hotmail) is owned by a major backer of some of
the more broken (but profitable) proposals.

Unless there are patents currently pending on the "technology" in SPF,
the answer is "no".  IANAL, but were a patent to be granted it would
have to be applied for by the authors of the technology within 1 year of
publication.  Given that SPF doesn't do anything really new, I'd be
surprised if even the USPTO found it innovative and non-obvious enough
for a patent.  It's basically a "reverse MX record".  Rather than
answering the query "where should I send mail for <domain name>?" it's
answering "where should I accept mail from <domain name>?".

Barring bugs in the DNS server, SPF records are pretty small (the AOL
SPF record is 185 bytes) and shouldn't present any DOS problems.

Yes and it's up to the local configuration what to do with "unknown"
mail, it can be accepted, rejected or "other" where other might be
"increase spam score by 1.5".  Ideally major ISPs and mail hosts will
add SPF records quickly and that alone should curtail the spam problem
significantly, even if you are accepting unknown mail.

Subject: [PLUG] RAID 5 problems...
Message-ID: <40A53BDE.1010502@robinson-west.com>

Trying to implement raid five, I've had it corrupt multiple times.

Do you need a spare drive for a raid 5 to work?

I'm trying a raid 1 now with 1 spare drive,  hopefully
it's the way I set Raid 5 up.  It could be that the
scsi card, drives, power source, or 68 pin scsi cable
are the source of the problem.

Maybe I should just get a new 68 pin LVD cable.

For an adaptec 2940U2W, do the connected drives
have to be able to draw combined no more bandwidth
than the card is capable of?  I have four hard disks that
can do, I guess, 20 mb/s.  I have a tape drive too that
can do 10 mb/s.  I'm wondering if lack of bus bandwidth
caused my RAID 5 to crash.

If so, I can see about picking up a second scsi card
and cable to increase the bandwidth I have to
work with.

Anyone know off hand what an ultra 2 scsi hard drive
on average draws power wise?

Why does md need a spare drive and does it need to be
a whole drive or just a partition on one?  How big does
the spare need to be?

Raid 1 should be more repairable than raid 5 since each
drive has a normal filesystem on it.

On my mail server $mydomain and by inference $myorigin are not 
virtualized.  Only the 14 other domains are.  Also $mydomain has no 
entries into the virtual table.

Looking at the Gibraltar page it appears to be a commercial product. You
can download a trail version, but it looks like the 1.2 release goes for
990 Euros(?) per license. Are they going for the Sendmail model?

A few things here i can answer.  Yes you do need a spare drive for raid 5.  
For example if you have 5 20gig drives you would end up with an array that is 
80gigs (it uses the extra 20 gigs for parity).  Thats the beauty of raid 5, 
you can lose a drive in the array and be able to replace it and rebuild your 
data.  You also need a minimum of 3 drives to implement it.

I can not give you a knowledgable answer about your bandwidth question, but I 
can let you know I am have a raid 5 array I am running on a compaq card with 
7 drives on it and havent had any problems.

As far as any array goes each "disk" should be a separate drive.  Preferably 
all the same model, but you should try to have them be the same size at 
least.  The size of the raid array will be calculated by the smallest drive.  
If you have a 5 gig, and 2 10 gig disks in an array, it is only going to use 
5 gigs on each of the 10 gig drives (I dont know if you can partition these 
into 2 5gig partitions and use the extra space for something else)

Hope i answered a few of your questions

Does plug support this? I'm getting Dunno in the logs.

I think I have a valid SPF record set up on my domain server
for my own domain.  Can someone verify?

I guess I should ask my ISP to implement this, at least the record.

I've looked through the archives...  It appears that I'm the first one 
to discuss SPF.
Can anyone point me out more specifically in case I've missed it?

The beauty of SPF is that looking up a TXT record can be done fairly fast
as long as the domain owners implement it and it is less invasive than 
bounce
check or greylisting.

into existing code, without re-compiling. Ramchandar Krishnamurthy shows
how this can be done.

"The .NET framework provides the plumbing, allowing you to concentrate on

The version that I modified is 0.99.8, which is a free product, released
under the GPL, if I recall.  It has a slightly older kernel, but the
whole package really does some amazing things.  No fancy web interface
either, just you and a built-on-Debian command line.

Actually, that's not the case.  With a few exceptions, speakers on the
main tracks are *not* paid, although their conference fee is waived.
Speakers giving tutorial talks (before the general conference) are
paid from the extra money collected by the tuition fees.

However, a conference of this size *is* an expensive operation.
Having been involved in some way with every OSCON (and Perl
conference) from the beginning, I can tell you a lot goes on behind
the scenes to make this all work.  I can also tell you that I've been
told by reliable sources that the conference actually *loses* money
each year, so even at these rates, nobody's laughing all the way to
the bank.  Tim sees the conference as an essential component of being
the world's largest publisher of books about open source software,
and thus as a loss center, not a profit center.

The speakers are not allowed to propose or deliver presentations that
are product oriented, although certainly you'll be more likely to buy
a person's book once you've heard them speak (in theory :-).

Thanks.  I think the SPF filter just marks you mail and that 
spamassassin has to
process the markings.  Anyone upgrading their spamassassin?

I  must say that I'm amazed by the some of the flaming over this.  I hope it
quiets down.  The SMTP protocol is troubled by it's inherent weaknesses.
The fact that it's so hard to know where something is really coming from
results in filtering being overused and over strained.

One note, I believe their are ways to make SPF more leanient for sources
that should be able to relay through you.  There is SRS.  I still think
a better solution is to set up additional mailsites though for remote
locations.

I think my SPF record is good to go.  Unfortunately, my attempt to bring a
second server up using Raid 1 with a spare instead of Raid 5 failed.  I
really want to get my primary outside server back up.

I don't get Linux Journal.  I wanted to ask about it because people 
sometimes say something that isn't in print.  As far as what to do with 
unknown mail, anyone implementing SPF have a suggestion?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0405151828260.27985@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I've googled without finding the answer to my questions about setting up a
WEP key for the SOHO WiFi portion of the network. The LinkSys/Cisco WAP is
configured (thanks to Russell and Kurt), and the Orinoco Gold card worked
immediately in the IBM ThinkPad 600E (when '/etc/rc.d/rc.pcmcia start' was
run).

  From what I've read, the KEY="..." line goes in wireless.opts on the
portable (it's running Slackware-9.1) and in the appropriate place on the
wireless hub.

  But, how to select a WEP key? Do I just pick any 12 (or so) hex pairs? Is
there any rhyme or reason to selecting a key that will be as secure as any
other in a very low volume (1 portable, not on all the time) environment?

  I also have a question about WAP placement. On my computer desk in the
office I have a bookshelf. If I put the WAP on the top shelf it's surrounded
on two sides by the particle board side and back. Do I need a box or
something to raise the antennae above the verticals? The portables will be
used the den (about 30 feet as the radio waves fly through walls) and,
possibly, the back yard if it's ever nice enough (but not too light to see
the LCD screen). My searches on the Web have yielded all sorts of hits but
nothing pertinent to these two questions.

Do *not* consider WEP secure.  It isn't secure.  It will stop casual
assaults, but nothing sustained.

Most WAPs have some sort of key generating things... there's some
standard turning characters into a key.  In the past I've set my WEP key
to 'pepsi' and 'alina' (there was a Maxim magazine sitting there when I
picked that one, see
http://www.maximonline.com/girls_of_maxim/swimsuit_2004/alina.html).

Try it without raising it... if it doesn't work, try raising it...
AFAIK, the only way to be sure Wifi will work in a location is to test
it out and make sure it does work.

Randomly, make it up as you go along, make it as long as possible.  Your
Access Point is going to be on all the time, isn't?  That will be the
target of leachers.

Particle board will block some of the waves, but may not cut out enough
to matter.  The foil on the insulation of your house will be more of a
problem, unless your like me and your house doesn't have real
insulation, but instead has this gray fluffy stuff that has long since
packed down to the bottom of the walls.

You need to modify /etc/network/interfaces to include the wireless
extensions for the pcmcia card.  Things like:

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
    address 192.168.100.100
    network 192.168.100.0
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    broadcast 192.168.100.255
    gateway 192.168.100.1
    wireless_mode managed
    wireless_essid mywifinetwork
    wireless_key 2974385d349d38ad15f444cfec
    wireless_channel 7

Change to suit your needs, you should be able to just plug in the
wireless card, and find out what interface name was assigned to it by
looking in /var/log/syslog.

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

Message-ID: <20040516155001.GA9739@gate.kl-ic.com>

Regards WEP security:   The purpose of WEP is not to make your system
perfectly secure.  WEP merely makes it more costly to penetrate your
network remotely.  WEP penetration is more expensive than slipping 
your sliding glass door off its rails and copying a hard drive, or
calling your secretary for a little social engineering.  WEP is not 
likely to be the weakest link in your security chain.  That said,
you should be using SSH protocols on your inside ethernet, and over
wireless.  Defense in depth.

WEP at least keeps the traffic down.  A seven tumbler lock is better
than a hook-and-loop, but neither should be confused with a bank vault.

Regards finding a key:  The builtin "generate a random hex string from a
phrase" feature of most WAPs is probably good enough.  As a contrarian,
though, I typically get my random numbers from http://www.random.org .

Accept it, unless you don't like getting email.  If possible add a
header so you can have spam assassin increase it's spam score and use it
as another criterion for separating the spam from the ham.

Any reason for not using WPA over WEP? I understand if you have legacy 
issues like OS and/or hardware that doesn't support WPA as we've faced 
that problem in the office with Win2K. New access points and/or 
wireless routers should support WPA in some fashion. WPA supports more 
advanced encryption where new encryption keys are generated after some 
set interval. 

For my own WIFI porting of my home network I use a Linksys WAP54G access 
point with WPA Preshared Key enabled and it supports either TKIP or AES 
encryption with WPA enabled. I used AES encryption and a group key 
renewal of 300 seconds. WPA works fine with WinXP and under Linux I'm 
using the "wpa_supplicant" daemon on my laptop that runs SuSE 9.0. I 
couldn't find the "wpa_supplicant" daemon on the SuSE CDs so I had to 
build it from the source. 

For managing WEP keys under Linux I use the "kwifimanager" program that 
is part of KDE. At some point it would be nice to have a unified 
process for managing both WPA and WEP but so far I have found that I 
need two different pieces of software to do this and I don't really 
have the time for any further experimentation.

WEP scares the heck of me since it is my understanding that good 
cracking programs exist to allow someone to crack a WEP key after the 
program sniffs a sufficient number of packets from a given wireless 
network. This may not be so easy on a small home network with a couple 
of machines that aren't generating millions of packets but say in an 
office that has 20-30 people all using WIFI it wouldn't take long to 
generate millions of packets on the network.

I'm still amazed at how many of my neighbors have WIFI in their home and 
in some cases they have the default SSID "linksys" broadcasting and WEP 
isn't even turned on. Sadly I the vendors are to blame as even the 
Linksys quick start guide recommends just using the defaults so 
everything just works. That's really dumb since it doesn't take into 
account that adjacent houses all may have the of the same AP or router 
broadcasting the same SSID and are all set on the same channel. :-O

I'm sorry as I probably didn't really answer all of your questions since 
I'm pretty limited in my WIFI experience.

I handle this by putting my access point outside my firewall.

I did this to a certain extent but still used WEP when I was stuck with 
a Win2K laptop from work that only supported WEP through WIFI. I added 
a 3rd NIC to my dual-homed firewall. I put my AP on its own subnet and 
used OpenBSD's "authpf" for authenticating a user into the internal 
network from the WIFI subnet. Since all of the WIFI systems I have at 
home now support WPA I've moved the AP back inside as it's easier for 
the less technical users within my household to access my internal 
servers.

I wouldn't ever want a completely open AP on my home network since I 
don't want to have the FBI or other law enforcement officials showing 
up on my doorstep. Someone sitting in a car outside my house or one of 
my neighbors could potentially use my AP to use my internet connection 
to access systems illegally or something if it was completely open. I 
don't think most of my neighbors are that technical and none of them 
strike me as the types as they're all nice people but you never know 
these days. 

In an office that is secured using WEP or even WPA think about how easy 
it is to open up a network so an AP is wide open. All it takes is for 
someone to reset an AP using the button on the back and presto...The 
system goes back to default settings which include broadcasting a SSID, 
and all security settings are disabled. 

I'd like to see an AP that can be reset but still retains certain 
settings like SSID, WEP/WPA so the AP can never to set completely back 
to its factory settings which leave it wide open to anyone with a 
working 802.11 NIC within communication range. From what I've seen the 
consumer type APs that everyone is using do not have this feature and 
most offices I see use the same ones e.g. Linksys, D-Link, Netgear 
modules that people typically use at home.

PTP had a legal opinion on this and except for the hassle there was no
risk to having an open AP.

While helping set up Rich Shepard's Linksys acess point, I was
somewhat astonished to find that the wireless network was essentially
bridged with the inside interfaces (the hub side) of the device.
Essentially (pardon the ASCII art):

  OUTSIDE                   INSIDE

                       ((*))
           +---------+  / \   wireless
           |         |   |
 to        |         +---+
 cable/dsl |         |
     ------+         +---     4 ethernet ports
           |         +---
           |         +---
           |         +---
           |         |
           +---------+

All of the INSIDE, wired and wireless are all on the same subnet,
e.g., 192.168.xxx.0/24.

In my linux-based router at home, my PCI wireless card uses a separate
network for its interface from the other "inside" network.  Do all
WAP's behave like Rich's Linksys?  I kind of like being able to
separate the networks.

Yes, most WAPs function as bridges.

Which is why I have a separate firewall and a access point, and not a
wireless DSL/cable router.

My setup

        OUTSIDE                   INSIDE

                       ((*))

           |         |
           |         |
           +---------+

I have set up my inside interface and my wireless interface to act as
two separate and unreachable (from each other) networks.  That way my
home network is secure and secured from the wireless.  My wireless AP is
completely open and doesn't use WAP, but it is behind a firewall.

How do get to your "stuff" on the Inside Interface from the wireless side?
 You do not?  Is the wireless side only for Internet access?  Your design
appears secure, but some of my clients use wireless as their only
connectivity to the "Inside Interface" part of the LAN.

The only person who would need access inside is myself.  I ssh to a box
outside my network and back in for access.  I would suggest having
another host setup as a vpn access server and use that for wireless to
inside access.

Never depend on wireless for security, is the model that I have found
most reliable.  Then I'm never disappointed.

I've heard often that WEP is not secure- why is that?  Is WEP so
fundamentally different from SSL or SSH that it does not offer the same
level of security?  Is it just a design flaw?  Not knowing enough about
either but couldn't something as secure as ssh be extended to a WEP
implmentation?

This seems to be cited frequently in googled pages.... it is not a well

The short answer: yes.

The design goal of most access points is to add one or more systems to
the LAN without stringing wires. Most consumers want the systems to be
able to talk to each other for file/printer sharing. Putting them on
different networks makes that a lot more difficult.

However, where you put the access point in your LAN can make a difference.
In your example you showed an AP/router that manages a private network.
If your wired LAN is on a different hub/switch, then hanging the AP off
one of those connectors can essentially put the wireless connections
on a separate network:

  OUTSIDE                   INSIDE

                                         ((*))
           +---------+            +---+   / \   wireless
           |         |            | A |    |
 to        |    r    +------------+ P |----+   192.168.1.0/24
 cable/dsl |    o    |            |   |
     ------+    u    +---   LAN   +---+
           |    t    +---
           |    e    +--- 192.168.0.0/24
           |    r    +---
           |         |
           +---------+

Note that this only works for AP's which act as routers. My WAP-11, for
instance, is just a bridge.

A lot depends on what you're trying to accomplish. Conceptually there's
no difference between the wired/wireless connections to the AP, especially
if most of your connections are wireless.

When you think about it, putting things on the same subnet makes 
sense for most users.  They want to reach their printer and their
desktop from their wireless laptop, and probably couldn't handle
writing routing tables, especially if they had multiple switches
and subnets.

The Linksys WAPs and the Siemens Speedstream WAP do it that way.  I
prefer everything on one subnet myself, as I use my server's DHCP to
assign the same persistent ID to my laptop whether it is tethered or
wireless.  I feed my network with a crossover cable into one of the
4 ethernet ports on the back of the WAP, so the WAP ethernet ports,
and the wireless, are both extensions of the internal network.  I
have WEP to keep out the casual interloper, and SSH between machines
to slow down the folks that get through WEP, and Smith&Wesson to take
care of the folks that penetrate my physical security ( a much more
likely risk, IMHO ).

If you want a separate net, you can connect one of the WAP "internal"
ports to a separate E'net port on your server or firewall.  Otherwise,
you can use the cable/dsl port of the WAP to connect to the internal
network and get a different subnet, albeit one that inherits the
internal network's security.  And if you don't like the way THAT
works, buy a WRT54G and install one of the hacked firmware versions
that works the way you prefer, routing tables and all.  As the Perl
folks say, "there's more than one way to do it".

"I cried because I had no drivers, until I met a man who had no source ..."

I spent part of yesterday helping a young friend try to find a Mac
compatable PCI wireless card.  We ended up mail ordering a WET54G
ethernet-connected bridge.  For PCMCIA cards, we found only Apple,
Asante and Farallon/Proxim cards.  There is another company that sells 
Mac drivers for PRISM cards, $30.  There may be more out there but
we didn't see it.

So as hard as it seems to find Linux drivers in a Windoze world, there
are drivers or development projects for most of the PCMCIA cards out 
there.  The poor Mac folks are having a much harder time of it.

Don't the new Mac's pretty much all have wireless builtin?  Or maybe
you meant to compare "poor Mac folks" with "wealthy Mac folks", the
latter presumably able to afford the newer Mac's. ;-)

I found the information shortly after I sent this.  Due to a mail server 
upgrade fubarage, that was this morning.

Hopefully we have a speaker for the AT session.  If not, we will think of

Message-ID: <20040518031808.GA1648@nellump.net>

How significant of an impact does the cache size have on an IDE hard
drive? I see two commonly available configurations: 2 MB cache and 8 MB
cache. There really isn't much of a price difference to justify going
with the smaller cache drive, but I'm still curious. My best guess is
that for a system whose data retrieval patterns are relatively
scattered, then the cache might help, but that it would not do much for
a backup or MP3 server.

The biggest reason you want the 8mb cache:

2mb cache = 1 year warranty
8mb cache = 3 year warranty

With the adjusted firmware do you only get filtering between inside and
outside? Or do you get the ability to do filtering and/or routing between
all three legs?

See the diagram at  http://docs.sveasoft.com/SV-WRT54GHardware.html
It shows the three ports (eth0 [times 4], eth1 [WAN], eth2 [WIFI] )
that the firmware talks to.  The adjusted firmware can do anything
that Linux can be configured to do, so it is a matter of configuring
route  and  iptables  and so forth.  The EWRT folks 
(  http://www.portless.net/ewrt/ )  serve up a personaltelco captive
portal on the Wifi, redirect information from security cameras, all 
sorts of things.   This is NOT a gui/webpage setup kind of thing,
you have to write the tables, crosscompile, build and flash the code
yourself, but it is apparently not difficult for someone who has done
similar configuration on a regular Linux desktop machine.  And of
course, if you turn off the outside access to the flash, it is much
more secure than a web page configuration would be.

I hope we can have a demo of EWRT configuration at a future Advanced
Topics.

Advanced topics, Wednesday May 19:

I will be bringing my LP70 projector and my baby (40 inch) screen;
it would be nice if someone has a larger screen and brings that.

I rewired a portion of the projector to make it turn on reliably,
and it hasn't given me any problems the last dozen times I used it,
but obsessive-compulsive me is still a little worried that it may
not be perfectly reliable yet.  The LP70 is 1024x768 and light-years
better than the old Proxima, though.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0405181329050.24278-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

Goggle'in has me running around in circles trying to get DBI with an ODBC
data source working.  I'm stuck dealing with a database on a MS SQLServer
and the script runs on a Linux box.

Anyone have good step-by-step instructions?

  FWIW, I have installed iODBC from an RPM but installing DBD::ODBC using
CPAN fails as does using a plain old tarball.  It appears the RPM didn't
supply all the directories or perl Makefile.PL -o /usr/lib (where the
iodbc libs reside) doesn't recognize them as iodbc libraries.


TIA,

I'm guessing that there's a -devel version of the RPM that you need
to install as well.  That's the one that usually trips me up.

Thump goes my head against the floor.  (Tripped, I believe -- still have
to test.)  There was a -devel package.  And I just shut down all the
Mozilla tabs I had open dealing with it so I could work on something
else.  (Seems it's a day for personal rain clouds following me around.  
This isn't the first for today.  :-)

I have a bigger screen. Someone would need to get it from me tonight as I 
cannot get it there on my own.  (I will be coming straight from work and I 
don't want to carry it both ways.)

The ISC dhcp implementation has a rerouting package to punch into another
subnet, if your using dhcp with a pool of say 1 ip address you
shouldn't have any illegits hopping on.  If you have to logon to an 
encrypted
web link to transmit with the ip dhcp gives you, that should stop 
illicit traffic
too.  Someones more likely to hop on and attack your laptop as opposed to
your Wireless gateway.

Learning how to route between subnets isn't a bad idea, it offers some
security benefits.  It's easier to route legitimate traffic in than it 
is to block
illegitimate traffic, one should implement both of the firewalling
strategies though.  I can't think of a really good reason to avoid 
putting an
AP on it's own subnet.  If you use samba instead of NT, it shouldn't be too
hard to extend smb shares onto another subnet.  Security wise, do you
need to have an AP Wireless hub transmitting onto the Net?  Do you
want to send any sensitive information over it?  Wireless technology
offers a possibility of community communications on subjects that
aren't security sensitive.

WEP sounds like a waste of time.  SSL tunneling all protocols seems like
a better idea.  What would really be cool would be to replace WEP in the
wireless cards themselves with ssh technology.

Rather than trying for time-of-day limitations, you could make use of one
or more of the linux Quality of Service packages.  If you're using a linux
box as your firewall this should be pretty easy.

http://www.linuxforum.com/linux-bandwidth-limit/cbq.html

This allows you to limit Kazaa to whatever data rate you'd like while
allowing other protocols to speed ahead.

Anyone ever heard of IMail?  It apparently works with declude.  I hear 
with IP4R
lists and RHSBL's that there are ways to balance those checks using 
multiple
checks.  I think Postfix with Mailscanner uses declude, but my ISP says
otherwise.  I've been trying to find out more about what they're doing 
just to be
informed ;-)  I've never heard of Imail before.

I like to work on the forging problem myself.  Aside from anti forging 
techniques
and RHSBL's, what is being done to discourage people who write viruses and
spambot's directly?  What is the rate for catching these people and 
intervening
via diplomacy or law enforcement in person?  I'm not saying that any 
spammer
should be brutalized, especially innocent ones.  I wonder if law 
enforcement/high
tech specialists visiting some of the worst spammers to discourage the 
behavior
or clean up infected systems gratis is a necessary part of the spam 
solution.
 
There is enough monetary loss that some business may find economic wisdom
in offers of free assistance to willing parties that need it.  With SPF 
and technologies
like it, knowledge of where spam is coming from increases the 
possibility of someone
carrying out targeted on site visits.  Whether we are there yet or not 
is a curiosity
or mine.  How can we know if this happening and under which standard such
visits will be governed?  What about liability?
  
Everyone could start charging for someone to send them an email, but I know
that a lot of people wouldn't like that.  It also reduces the existence 
of this type
of forum.

A historical note of interest, people used to pay for their paper mail. 
 Jefferson got
upset about the amount of mail he'd get at times because he couldn't 
afford it.  I
wonder if email will change the same way that paper mail has?  Who 
knows, the
U.S. Postal Service may change and take over Internet email in this country
someday.  We are using less paper communication than we did even five years
ago, that suggests that what goes through email systems now must be getting
more critical.

I believe IMail is windows-only "solution", and if I'm thinking of
the correct program a friend of mine is forced to use it, and has had
many frustrating moments...  Sorry for being so vague :(.

Innocent spammers?  What's the distinction between guilty and
innocent?

I don't believe this is possible to do without violating at least one
ammendment, but INAL.

FWIW, a few years ago there was some talk about the US Post office
assigning everyone an email address based on their postal address, and
delivering the mail in hardcopy to mailboxes.. I don't know how
serious the discussion was, but it's probably in the slashdot
archives somewhere.

You know, I could've sworn that I searched the bugs database a couple 
days ago and came up empty. Getting senile I guess.

Thanks. There was a workaround in there that worked for me.

Sometimes there are minor errors in a package's install/remove
scripts, which you can repair in /var/lib/dpkg/info/foo.* and then
run:

  # dpkg --configure foo

Always good to feedback any problems to the packages maintainers
(probably already reports by the time you look).

Infected computers where the owner had no intention of spamming
others.  Yeah, it's an oxy moron.

It's a shame that Imail is a Windows only solution.  It's also a shame
that my Internet access went out and it's the phone company's, not
my ISP's, problem.  My dad uses their filtered email service right
now, he gets an awful lot of warnings about virus breakouts.  I
don't understand why Opus doesn't change to something other
than Windows.  What's the viability of competing to provide
broadband service running a Linux and/or FreeBSD based ISP?

On another topic...  I think the grounding issue may have been linked
to improper scsi termination.  It also appears that my raid crashes are
being brought on by a temperature problem.  It was in the 80's when
I was having trouble.  I've attempted adding another fan, it would be
nice to know the temperature on the surfaces of the drives and inside
the case though.  I'm also wondering if there are some snap on fans
for 3.5 inch bays.

The other thing I've wanted for a long time is a meter that informs me
of the power draw from the computer's power supply.  Does someone
make a product that works well with Linux?  I want to be able to
answer questions: is my 250W, etc., power supply big enough,
have the power wires to a drive shorted, and how many watt
hours do these servers use per day.  Briefly: short detection,
load detection, and brownout detection concerning the power
supply's max capacity.

There are quite a few out there. I use these O'Reilly books:

Running Linux ISBN 1-56592-469-X
Linux Network Administrator's Guide ISBN 1-56592-400-2

Unix in a Nutshell has been helpful at times too.
ISBN 1-56592-427-4

Not Linux specific, but you can learn a lot from _Unix Power Tools_.
Jerry Peek is the author.  The Multnomah library has two copies.

The only book that I know covers it is by O'Reilly and is woefully
out-dated.  At one time, I undertook to update the HOWTO, but didn't get
very far with it.  What problems are you having, specificially?

You can't really compare the two; while some of their capabilities
overlap, the combination of the two is usually the easiest and most
effective.  For example, if you're only using SSL protect SMTP relaying,

Subject: [PLUG] Getting rid of duplications...
Message-ID: <40AC5BBF.60107@robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to find all the mail exchangers for knllc.net so that I can 
upgrade 450 blocks to 550 blocks.  The
attached script is picking up duplicates from a copy of say yesterdays 
maillog created by postfix.

There can be more than one NOQUEUE with mx-unique#-knllc.net.  Whatever 
is sending this junk will forge
different hello names using the same mx-unique#.knllc.net at times.

In an arbitrary text file where the field seperator is a newline, is 
there a quick way to reduce duplicate entries
down to 1?  I could write a C program to take care of this, but that 
seems like overkill.  

Here's a sample of lines that I go after and apply cut to, etc. from the 
postfix log...

 .
 .
 .
May 17 03:17:46 xerxes postfix/smtpd[11010]: connect from 
sb-2-mx-237.knllc.net[66.10.93.237]
May 17 03:17:47 xerxes postfix/smtpd[11010]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from 
sb-2-mx-237.knllc.net[66.10.93.237]:
450 <sb2-ms-issuevulnerable.com>: Helo command rejected: Host not found; 
from=<sonya.h at issuevulnerable.com>
to=<sonya.h at robinson-west.com> proto=ESMTP helo=<sb2-ms-issuevulnerable.com>
May 17 03:17:47 xerxes postfix/smtpd[11010]: disconnect from 
sb-2-mx-237.knllc.net[66.10.93.237]
   .
   .
   .


I grepped this piece.  In reality, I've got SPF and other lines in the 
log.  Let's say instead of
issuevulnerable.com, that the same sb-2-mx-237.* shows up later in the 
log with
sonya.h at looloo.com.  My current script will now have sb-2-mx-237.* at
least twice.  I guess that's what the problem with it is.  

My only other thought is to hard block any site that doesn't pass SPF 
verification.  What
if knllc.net SPF registers looloo.com, issuevulnerable.com, alf.com, 
etc...?  What's to
stop someone from running multiple domain names off a single set of ip's 
so that you
have so many names to block even if you get away from blocking ip's that 
it becomes
absurd to do so?  If they have to buy another name to spam me that does 
cost them
money, but names are so cheap.  I imagine if I learn how to virtual host 
that I can
do at least three or four domains on a single ip.

BTW: I don't have a sonya.h user, though I don't know that that can help 
me here.

A good book for system administration and such is 
Linux Administration Handbook by Memeth, Snyder, Hein

It's a Linux specific rendering of the classic

You don't need a gui for web docs.  "lynx" and/or "links" work well as web 
browsers.

Subject: [PLUG] knoppix logging
Message-ID: <20040520190248.GB26381@patch.com>

I'm using knoppix to diagnose a network problem. The object is to have knoppix 
release and renew a dhcp address then look at the logs to see what server supplied the 
address.

Problem is, knoppix isn't logging anything to /var/log/messages or /ramdisk/var/log/messages.
Can't edit /etc/syslog.conf to change the target
Logging is functional for X and wtmp.

Suggestions?

Look for a program called "dhcpping".  It will tell you where the leases 
are coming from.

ethereal is also very useful.

dhcp does not record where it gets the lease from.

It should, but it does not.

Thanks, that's good

Except when you do a release/renew the interface goes down and the capture stops.

I worked around this with 

for i in `seq 1 200`
do
  tcpdump | tee -a dhcp.watch
done
 
> dhcp does not record where it gets the lease from.
> 
> It should, but it does not.

But, it does:

Windows:  ifconfig /all <= will show dhcp server
pump:     pump -i <IFACE> --status | grep "Boot server"
dhcpcd:   logs extensively in /var/log/dhcpcd.log, including IP of DHCP server
		(may require -d option, but that's easy enough)

pump documentation states:
       Pump logs a good deal of information to syslog, much of it at the DEBUG
       level.  If  you're having trouble, it's a good idea to turn up syslog's
       logging level.

which was the basis of my original question.  

`man pump` would have revealed the --status option which would have told me
what I needed to know.

But then I'd still be in the dark about knoppix logging possibilities.

Don't have knoppix here but this seems to work on Red Hat 7.3.

ifconfig eth0:1 10.0.0.1

tcpdump -i eth0:1 ether host my-mac-address

dhcpcd -k eth0

dhcpcd eth0

Cheers,
Mike

Wil, do you want to clarify what you mean here? By ssl, I'm assuming
you're referring to starttls, no? I do relaying with postfix based on
starttls (check the headers on this message), but I disbelieve that
mail.nxnw.org is ripe for relay abuse, as it only allows a particular
public key to relay through it, that postfix on the client end uses
to authenticate itself. Is there some flaw in this strategy that I'm
overlooking?

Granted, I have *no idea* how to get windows clients to present a
tls certificate when doing smtp -- but that's not a problem I have to
solve :-).

Subject: [PLUG] 3D graphics on SiS 300 and Gentoo
Message-ID: <1085104214.3625.1.camel@timmy>

I have been working on getting 3D graphics working on my system for a
while. Now, glxinfo reports:

direct rendering: Yes

But glxgears does not display any gears (just a black box). It does spit
out rather high FPS's (~415). Before, when glxinfo was reporting "No",
glxgears displayed gears, but at about 200FPS.

My card is an SIS 300/305 plugged in an AGP slot. lspci says this about
it:

0000:01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]
300/305 PCI/AGP VGA Display Adapter (rev 90)

I am using XFree86 4.3.99.902-r2 (the Gentoo ebuild) because 4.3.0 does
not include any support for my card (sis_dri.so does not exist).
sis_dri.so does exist in this more recent version.

Although i have the sis, sis_agp, and agpgart modules loaded, my
XFree86.0.log shows the following:

(EE) SIS(0): [drm] Failed to acquire AGP, AGP disabled

I am at a loss. Any ideas?

Thanks,
Evan

FWIW, glxgears displays in the 3000-5000fps range with the more
recent ati / nvidia cards.  I don't know much about SiS, although
judging from the little I know about the 300, I would guess it should
be much higher than 415 when working correctly.

Are you by chance, using xinerama, odd (or high) color depth, or a
particularly high resolution?  ( > 1280x1024?)

Not using xinerama or any other weird configuration. I was using
1152x864 at 24 bit. I switched to 16-bit 640x480, but still no gears.
The FPS did jump to ~620.

My hunch is something to do with AGP is not working correctly. Where can
I go to see more logging on that?

I believe Wil was saying that if you have an open relay on port 465, 
albeit one that demands SSL crypto, that sooner or later the spammers 
will figure out how to take advantage of it.

No, that's a pretty good scheme. I use it on my local net, but 
off-site hosts can only relay using smtp/auth.

Exactly.  If you're requiring a client cert, you're better off than
password authentication, but it's good deal more trouble to manage the
certs than just passwords.

At one point I tried to figure out how to use a cert with Netscape
(pre-Mozilla), but I have never been able to find docs that really
explain SSL/TLS certs very well, so I never figured it out.  When SMTP
AUTH came around I breathed a sigh of relief that I wouldn't have to. 
That said, I *would* like to find good docs that explain the intricacies
of SSL and the myriad of cert formats, ciphers, etc.

Did you set the user / group permissions for DRM correctly in the
config file?

In the XFree86 log file - should be in /var/log.

An approach that has helped me in the past to get my XF86Config file
tweaked properly is to boot the machine up with a Knoppix disk.  It does
an impressive job finding out what your video card's capabilities are and
writing a config file to match.

Is /var/log filling up as fast as you can clean it? Does `top' show
anything interesting? You can use the following "findbig" Perl script
written by Randal to identify the largest files...


#!/usr/bin/perl
require 'getopts.pl';
require 'find.pl';
&Getopts('n:');
$n = defined $opt_n ? $opt_n : 20;
@ARGV = ($ENV{'HOME'}) unless @ARGV;
&find(@ARGV);
sub wanted {
	$size{$name} = -s _ if not -l and -f _;
}
@sorted = sort { $size{$b} <=> $size{$a} } keys %size;
for (@sorted[0..($n-1)]) {
	printf
	    "%40s, %5dK, last accessed %3d days ago\n",
	    $_ , (-s)/1024, -A _;
}

e.g. `findbig /var'

Usually if there's a program writing to a file and you delete the file,
the OS still keeps the file open (and the space used).  So you'll need to
restart whatever program was using the log file.

No, it filled up with log files.  I need to watch that closer.  Always
on my day off too.  How does it know?  I just had to wait a bit for my
deletions to register.  I think it is working now.

Are you using logrotate to manage your log files?

It turns out the main culprit was amavisd-new!  There were 2 gigs of
old quarantined virus mails in there!  I am using logrotate but my
procmail log was not included.  It will be! And apt-clean freed some
space too.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0405211134590.16595-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

In a typical MS verses the world fiasco I was logging http access data as 
W3C Extended (Microsoft -- embrace and enhance) format then won the main 
battle and went back to combined.  Now I have a pile of these buggers that 
I'd like to get converted (as close as possible) to combined format.
   Awstats didn't like them when I tried to use it to read them in so
there may be an issue with the actual format.  I had found an Apache
LogFormat that claimed it was for W3C Extended but the 'other (Windows)'
log analysis program didn't like it either so this may be in vain.

Searches give me almost nothing on the topic and my attempts to figure out
a method to convert haven't panned out.  Anyone have a script or program
or can point me towards one to do this?


TIA,

Rod,

You might try searching freshmeat. e.g.,

for starters.

I did find this but after looking at it again I realize I had my
terms/formats confused.  I thought it converted from Apache (combined) to
Windows format.  A wrong direction for me.  When I just re-looked at it
and then loaded it on a system a few minutes ago I saw my confusion.  Now
hopefully I'll get them converted.
   One more win for Open Source Software!

Thanks for the pointer.

Message-ID: <BAY9-F57XzYd9FeNQwP0005d02d@hotmail.com>

This is sort of a warning for everyone who is attempting to install
Fedora RC2....

I did 3 installations of it.  The first two works just fine.
The 3rd one did not.  The Nvidia driver broke (I am using QuattroFX 
card....)
The other 2 boxes that worked are using older Nvidia chipsets and they are 
fine.

I did a google search and apparently this is a known issue.  And someone 
reported
that the *latest* kernel, 2.6.6, works fine.  I am trying to fetch
the patches but can't get to kernel.org (verio.net seems to be having 
problems).

So, be forewarned that you are using a *newer* Nvidia chipset on your video 
card,
you may want rethink about using Fedora RC2...

I just did an install this morning on an nForce 2 chipset with a Geforce
FX 5200 video card. It's up and running smooth as can be. Maybe it's just

The non-commercial drivers should work fine.  It is the commercial drivers 
that have problems with the kernel.  (The 4k stack issue.)  The only fix 
is to remove the 4k stack patch from the kernel and rebuild the kernel.

The problem i am running into is a hang on a scsi driver.

I submitted a source rpm for unison to the Fedora project today. 
Unison is sort of a two-way rsync; it negotiates changes between 
directories in two directions, not just one (ala rsync). If you're 
interested, the source rpm is online:

   http://www.madboa.com/geek/downloads/unison-2.9.1-0.fdr.1.src.rpm

To build it, you'll need a local ocaml installation, binary rpms for 
which are available from fedora.us.

Well I got if figured out.  Ended up writing a perl script the

accepted it ... kind of.  I have a test server to fiddle with and I placed 
the other domains data into it.  Interesting results so far.

Thanks for the input from all.

There is fping (can't remember where to find it) but I'd suggest you power
the whole network down.  Start up the hubs/switches/routers and then the
Samba server.  After they're all running start the windows systems one at 
a time.  I quite often had trouble with Win9x systems on a not-Windows 
only network.  The stupid Windows machines and the MS TCP/IP stack would 
get something in the mind and not let go of it.  ARP tables whatever. And 
just retarting didn't work very often.  It took a complete powerdown.
   If this doesn't help try removing and reinstalling the TCP/IP stack and 
if all else fails the NIC drivers.

Of course the network experts on the list probably have a better solution 
but I usually got so mad I resorted to the bigger hammer technique.

Ahh... when I saw that there, I thought to myself "Self, I'll bet that
fubar's up nvidia drivers." ...sure enough, I was right.

Also, small correction; it isn't a 4K patch, it's a mainline kernel
option.  You don't need to remove any patches, just change one quick
thing in your .config.  :-)

Find me a card reasonably priced that performs comparably to nVidia
cards with open source driver that aren't hindered by the vendor...

nVidia does have good reason for keeping parts of their drivers closed
source.  As such, they must be distributed in binary form, and that 4k
stack option *does* break binary compatibility, apparently... so of
course it's going to break the drivers.  :-)

I do believe it is perhaps a bit irresponsible of RedHat to distribute a
kernel with the 4k option enabled....

   I did uncheck that option in .config but
  apparently, in the new 2.6.6 kernel, that 4k stack option is permanent
  and no longer configurable...

I believe the technical reason for this problem is the browse master
configuration in the "Client for Microsoft Networks" service component on
the windows boxes. One of the windows boxes has elected itself browse
master, and the samba netbios daemon is probably not configured to allow
being a slave. The reason powering down all the windows boxes works, is
because then the linux box can make itself master before any windows boxes
can challenge it.

I'm not familiar with Samba enough to know if you can configure browse
master settings. I'm sure you can, and if so, that might be a place to
start as far as resolving your issue.

  Two weeks ago tomorrow a young friend of mine was very seriously injured
in a car accident as she began her trip to spend Mother's Day with her
family in Seattle. In brief, both her legs were severed above the knees, she
has serious internal damage and she's still in the ICU at Emmanual where
they're keeping her in a sedated coma as she fights infection after
infection. Four days later she had her 30th birthday. Of course, she's not
at all aware of the extent of the damage. Her name is Josey Peterson.

  If you're willing to donate blood in her name, please do so. She (or her
insurer) get a credit for each pint contributed. Since she'll be in the
hospital for several months and will have a long road to recovery and
getting back to her life as a great photographer and master printer, we're
all doing what we can to help.

  In addition to the blood donations, an account has been set up in her name
at one of the local banks to help defray medical expenses. A local provider
is hosting a Web site, but whoever threw a page up there did a horrible job:
the text cannot be read over the image <http://www.joseyaid.com/>. Perhaps
someone with good Web design skills will design and post a better page. If
you're willing to help in this regard, please call Blue Moon Camera and
Machine on North Lombard (503-978-0333) and speak with Jake, Zeb or Amanda.

Thanks, all,

Good idea. I'll see how that works in about 8 hours when the ISO is

  She doesn't need to pay for blood she's received when we contribute a
replacement pint. I don't know what the current price is for a pint of
blood. Last I knew -- several years ago -- it was $75. So, she doesn't need
to pay for each replacement pint contributed in her name.

Welcome to Fedora Core 2. As you've noticed, this is a known issue. This
is what happens when you use a highly experimental kernel, things break.
As the feature involved does seem to be the way of the future, it seems
likely that nVidia will take care of this issue very soon, but they
haven't had a driver release since this feature was created (and they're
having to deal with a major new product in the mean time too). This goes
back to Fedora being an _experimental_ distribution, by contrast nVidia's
driver is aimed at the workstation market whom are generally a lot more
conservative about new distributions (guess what, you've got a Quatro
card, they might listen to you!). Until the likely driver update the open
source "nv" driver works or you can build a kernel with the 4K stacks
disabled (apparently a process they've made difficult).

Since we're on the topic of Fedora breakage. You might want to avoid
installing it on dual-boot systems as well. The 2.6 kernel changed how
the kernel reported the partition table information, and Fedora failed to
take the time to get newer versions of the utilities.

Getting SiS video working nicely is a big PITA.  I've had varying luck,
currently none.  If I had more need for DRI or less interest in hacking
around, I'd just go buy a used ATI or Matrox at FreeGeek.

Go see http://www.openna.com or pick up Securing and Optimizing Redhat Linux
from www.tldp.org.  This book has a good section on samble.

Try tcpdchk.  Make sure nmbd and smbd are running.  Don't string too 
many hubs
together, you'll get unreliable samba performance.  DNS comes first, go to
www.isc.org and set up split dns.  Use netstat -lpt on the samba box to 
make sure
smbd and nmbd are running.  Swat is shunned by many, but as long as you 
have a
good iptables firewall that filters your external interfaces or you run 
samba behind
your firewall, you'll be fine using it.  Remember that everyone has to 
be in the same
domain.  Use security = user and program the 98 boxes to log on to your 
Windows
NT, samba, domain server.  It's properties on Microsoft Network client 
in network
neighborhood.  I strongly recommend going to grc.com and understanding 
Gibson's
recommendations about controlling Windows 98 network bindings so that 
you will
have the fewest possible.  Most common problems are not setting up samba 
to use
encrypted passwords and not being in the right domain.  I believe you 
can connect
multiple domains to the same samba server though by collating browse 
lists with it.
I strongly recommend using samba-2.8 or newer.  

If you can't ping the samba server, is that machine in the same subnet? 
 There are also
sysctl keys that disable ping support.

I'm attaching my working smb.conf.  This is my master smb server that 
Windows 98 logs
into just fine.

Message-ID: <20040522185757.A811D406A@joseph.doink.com>

Hi folks, long time no e-see,

For the last 3-4 days my machine is rebooting on its own.  It shuts 
down at 6:32-ish and is back up at 6:43-ish.  I've been 
troubleshooting this, but I could use some help.  Here's what I've 
done so far:

- set the clock to before the reboot time and watched it pass
  right on by the troublesome time without rebooting.

- run each cron job that runs during those hours and found that
  none of them cause any problems.

- checked all my log files:

    /var/log/kernel/*
    /var/log/messages
    /var/log/secure
    /var/log/security/*
    /var/log/security.log
    /var/log/syslog

  and found nothing.  Really, the log file stops when the
  shutdown occurs and resumes when the reboot is finished.

- The day before the shutdowns started happening I installed 3
  pieces of music software, 2 were LADSPA plugin packages and one
  was "snd", a sound file editor.  I removed all of that and the
  problem persists.

- Checked my tripwire report.  Nothing odd.

- Mandrake 9.0's "msec" has a bit of an oddball report, e.g. 

  Security Warning: Change in Suid Root files found :
	    -       Newly added suid root file : /usr/X11R6/bin/Xwrapper
	    - No longer present suid root file : /usr/X11R6/bin/Xwrapper

  rpm -V and tripwire both think the offending files are fine.  The
  above could be reported if the snapshot file that msec uses
  gets corrupted or out of sync somehow.

- rpm -Va doesn't report anything new.

What else could/should I do to find the trouble?

Thanks....

Not that I would admit to remembering any Fortran, but I think this
ought not to be too difficult. Under the hood g77 uses a library
called libg2c which is really just GNU's name for libf2c. You can
find the source for libf2c here:

   http://www.netlib.org/f2c/

(Scroll down, look for libf2c.zip.) This library is written in C but
callable from Fortran. Following the examples here it should be possible
to write your own Fortran-callable wrappers around any C functions
including BSD socket functions. The tricky bit will be figuring out how
to map a BSD socket descriptor to a Fortran Unit number. File open.c
in libf2c would probably be a good place to start for this.

Another option would to redirect externally. You could have the Fortran
program open a named pipe (which to it is just another file), while some
other program written in C feeds data to the named pipe from a network
socket.

Are you pinging by name or by address?

nmap will find all addresses and ports open in a defined subnet.

Did you set up the Samba server to be the Wins server?  What OS level
did you assign to the Samba server?  How long has the peer to peer
network been running?  All of these are factors in the Browse Master
election.

Good Luck,

Hmm, the mentions I saw elsewhere didn't overstate the issue. Not only
did they ship a 4K stack kernel, but they deliberatly removed the ability
to revert this from their kernel source RPMs.

They knew:
http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-test-list/2004-April/msg01454.html

Best easily findable answer:
http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=26745


So you can go for vanilla kernel source, otherwise you have to manually
edit the kernel source RPM, and remove the application of the
"linux-2.6.5-nostack.patch" patch. There have been a couple mentions that
CONFIG_REGPARMS *may* also cause problems.

Russell,

  There used to be some FORTRAN libraries to collect data from instruments
with the GPIB (I think that's the name HP gave it) bus interface. So, I
suspect that it should be possible to load data from external sources.

This looks like it is most likely a hardware problem, check the
motherboard for bulging/leaking capacitors.  If they look fine, try
changing power supplies.

Power problems?  Do you have a UPS?  If so, is the battery still good?

  Is anyone currently using win4lin to run legacy M$ apps on a virtual win98

VMware fires up just fine, but I can't get it to load the virtural win98.
Don't know if I need to re-run the vmware.pl script or there's another
problem for me to identify and solve.

  How is the hardware support in win4lin? I need access primarily to my two
printers and, on very rare occasions, to the cd-rom drive.

TIA,

I use win4lin to support MSIE for software development.  It seems to
work just fine with Windows 98.  I can access my smb/lpr printers just
fine and the CDROM.  The only thing it doesn't seem to support is
activeX.  I've also used it with some weird MS meeting software through
IE that it didn't handle very well.  My only disappointment is if I want
to use it with a 2.6 kernel, I have to pay more money....

Have you tried the latest version of Wine? It's getting better by the
month - grab and compile the latest source distribution from:

http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/wine/

Sean,

  Thanks for the feedback. Are you running version 4 or 5? For the price
difference I'd like to give it a try on the new box and see if my two
applications (MapInfo and the GPS mission planning/differential correction)
run on it.

Evan,

  No, I haven't. I tried it some time last year and MI wouldn't run at all.
I will give the new version a shot.

I think it's version 3.0, which is why they won't do very much for me
unless I upgrade.

Nothing else in the house is experiencing power line problems.
I do have a UPS.  I'm not sure how to test the battery; I suppose I 
could take it to a battery shop.  My UPS software hasn't complained 
at all.  Maybe that's not conclusive tho.

Thanks for the idea....

I'll look at the MB.  I wouldn't expect reboots at the same time each 
day, within +/- 3 minutes, from a hardware problem that would be 
impervious to resetting the clock.  The power supply is new as of 
last summer.  I have a spare though and can try swapping.

Like Sean, I am using version 3 to run two applications under Windows
98: my genealogy program (TMG: The Master Genealogist) and an older
version of Delorme's Topo USA.  This is under Mandrake 9.2.

Works perfectly.  I was never ever able to get either program to run
well under Wine.

andy/Sean,

  OK. I'll buy the download version 5 and try it on my Slackware
workstation. Without reading the docs I don't know if I can just make a zip
file of _everything_ in the virtual win98's c: drive (including the OS, my
two applications and all files) and install all that on the new box with the
win4lin. Alternatively, I can dig out the win98se disk and install that,
then zip the application directories and move them over.

  Based on your experiences, what would you recommend?

Thanks,

Rich

andy,

  Next question: since the vendor supplies a kernel patch that must be
applied and the system rebooted, can the same patch be applied to new
kernels when as you apply them?

  I wonder how this works with the Slackware kernel upgrades since pkgtool
handles this automatically.

Hmmm-m-m,

Rich

That's a gotcha with Win4Lin... if you aren't using one of the distros
they provide a kernel for, you build your own kernel.  You'll have to
build your own kernel from now on if you use Win4Lin... I personally
enjoy building my own kernels (I can't *stand* letting somebody else
make such intricate choices about *my* system for me), but if you've
never done it before it can be a pain.  :-)

Don't use pkgtool for kernel upgrades any more if you start building
your own kernel.

Rob

Rob,

  Ah! I've built many a kernel. Now, however, I find (so far, at least) that
the stock Slackware kernels work well for me. Perhaps I'll just stick with
figuring out how to make vmware-4 run on slackware and put off another
decision until that version is no longer supporting the current kernel.

> Don't use pkgtool for kernel upgrades any more if you start building your

  True. I tend to use pkgtool when P at rick sends out a new version of
Slackware and build my own when either a security upgrade is released or I
need a particular configuration.

Many thanks,

Rich

Well, Pat doesn't patch them very often, so you should be able to just
take his .config (and if you can't find it, let me know, I went
searching for one a *long* time ago and found it in a very obscure
place, I have that place archived somewhere), patch the kernel, add the
win4lin options to the config, build, and be good to go.  :-)

Subject: [PLUG] win4lin?
Message-ID: <20040523044241.GA6392@gate.kl-ic.com>

I too am using Win4Lin version 4 with Win98 (I feel like I should
be talking about this at Winaholics Anonymous, not here) for a few
legacy applications.  I wouldn't mind using Wine, if I knew for sure
it would handle those legacy apps, but I have other things to do than
re-solve a solved problem.   I would rather wait for open source
replacements for the apps.

But I digress.  Win4Lin allows me to talk to dongled CAD apps, and 
seems to work with IE6 (for those Frontpage sites you would rather
not visit, but must), and most importantly for me, is designed to work
on top of Linux filesystems, with all the security and efficiencies of
that.  That means I can use Win4Lin in one desktop window, and edit
the text files that relate to an application in a Linux xterm window
on another virtual screen.  F##k notepad and dos-oid command windows.
Win4Lin reboots in seconds, which makes the usual windows crashes a
lot easier to live with. 

If I was really ambitious, I would hang all sorts of debuggers and
tracers on the programs running under windoze, and reverse engineer
them.  This would be a good platform for that, and help with porting
those apps to Linux, or designing replacements.

My biggest complaint is that Win4Lin is not compatable with 3 button
mice (which some CAD apps like).  When they finally get that fixed,
I will consider upgrading to a new version past 4.

My other complaint is that the install process kinda sucks, especially
if you need to combine the Win4Lin addons with a non-stock kernel.  You
can theoretically purchase a downloadable version over the web, but in
fact this is a Web-based installer, and you never actually get a CD
image or tar file that you can tinker with.  As a result, *after*
you pay your money, you are confronted with a failed partial download,
without even a clue as to how to back out and try again.   So even
though it costs $10 more, and means waiting for snailmail, you should
get the physical CD version.

I have a client who had a box in colo that would reboot at about the
same time every day. Turns out that the power cord had gone bad and when
the UPS truck went past the back of the building where his cabinet was,
it would shake the cord enough to disconnect. 

I doubt that your problem is a bad power cord, but I would NEVER have
checked the power cord on my client's colo box. One of the support guys
bumped the cord when plugging a keyboard in (and after plugging in the
monitor on the crash cart) and watched it reboot.

Strange but true.

I also had a SCSI disk that would fail every 44 hours, plus or minus 2
minutes. That might have been a failing capacitor, but it wasn't worth
investigating. I just got a new disk.

Keith,

  Thanks for a very insightful review. Germane to this last point, according
to one Web site I found Mall-Wart carries the boxed win4lin and the price,
IIRC, is $89.

I think you have to have a Win98 installation CD.  Win4Lin requires
it, probably for legal reasons as well as ease in extracting the
pieces they need.

I believe you need a new patch file for each new kernel.  NeTraverse
is pretty good about getting them out quickly.  

I'm not sure, 'cause I use a generic kernel on Mandrake and NeTraverse have
prebuilt kernels for that.

No idea, but my impression is that it is a very simple,
easy-to-install patch, especially if you're knowledgeable at building
kernels, which you seem to be.

I suggest booting from Knoppix about an hour before (up at 5:30? 
horrors!).  If the reboot is due to the hard disk or something on
it, Knoppix will still be running at 7:00.  If it is due to power
or other hardware, Knoppix will reboot, too, though it will not
leave a log of when.  

I'm betting it is something on the hard drive, possibly enemy action,
with a slight chance that it is a temporary disk failure caused by
frisky overuse by some other apps.  If the problem does track the hard
drive, it is time to build a new hard drive from scratch, because you
will never figure out which bits are bad - unless you've been running
tripwire and religiously saving the results.  Easier to do a rebuild,
reload from the distro, then reload apps and data.  The latter may be
copied across directly, since they may be corrupt but are unlikely to
crash the system.

Look at the BIOS and make sure all the suspend options are turned
off.  6:32 may be when the machine is quiet, some time after morning
log manipulations, and the BIOS thinks it can turn itself off.  A
hard drive powerdown may do the same thing.

The easiest way to test a UPS is to unplug it from the wall.  If the
attached computer crashes, the UPS is not doing its job (and there
is somebody on your circuit who is turning on some high power item
at 6:32 or so - Alarm clock->shower->waterheater?).   Note, only the
CPU box should be on the UPS, the monitor should be powered from the
wall;  this could be the monitor getting reactivated and overloading
the UPS.

Good luck.  Oh, for a power line monitor chart recorder ...

I once ran a NT network in Chicago. WHen I looked at the logs, everyday 
at 6am, the UPS kicked in for like 5 seconds. What I finally found out 
was that at 6am, the local electric company switched from one type of 
power plant to others and caused a really brief interruption. Decreased 
the sensitivity on the UPS and it went away.

Is it true that Win4Lin does not yet support the 2.6

kernel, if you want to use it with a 2.6 distribution?

They also forgot that a few other video drivers use god-awfully huge
structures that they pass on the stack.  (ATI's driver had such
problems.  Thankfully the big bit on the end it no longer used and could
be dropped.)

I have been seeing all sorts of nasty problems with 2.6.5 from FC2.

I am now using the 2.6.6 kernel from Rawhide.  It is being much more
responsive on my dual AMD.  It also fixes the apic problems.  (Or so I
have been led to believe.  We will see if they come back.)

The Rawhide RPMS can be found at ftp://mirrors.kernel.org/fedora/ in the
development tree.

That wouldn't happen to be an opteron, would it? (If so, I'd like to

  Is there a simple way to edit postscript files? Google hasn't revealed any
to me. There's PsTricks, but that's for graphics within LaTeX.

  I downloaded some tabular data from Web pages. I want to strip off the
last line ("Report problems here") that falls on a second page when I
convert it to a pdf file. I would also strip off the header, too, if I could
identify it in the ps code.

  Any suggestions?

Thanks,

PS is stack-based (like RPN on an HP calculator), and while the commands
are a bit cryptic, you can generally figure out simple things like the
end-of-page command.  I've hand-edited lots of PS, using gv or GSView to
check my work.

Just ran across this:
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mj/papers/psref.txt
But note that most PS generators define their own macros and use those
instead of e.g. "showpage".

PDF is not normally hand-editable, since it's in binary format.  Convert
it to PS, fix it up, then convert back to PDF.

Much luck,
  Aaron

Download the tabular data in some other format than Postscript?

If you are stuck with Postscript, remember that a postscript file is
Just Text(TM).  Use your favorite text editor and go to town.  Of
course, it helps to have an inkling of how Postscript works.  It is a
postfix operator language, like your old HP calculators.  You stuff
things onto the stack and then call a function that eats the stuff on
the stack.  Stuff to be printed literally appears inside parens, e.g.:

  (this is text that is printed) show

where "show" is a function that "paints glyphs representing character
shapes".  You can tweek text inside the parens, but alignment is often
controlled externally, so it might mess up things.  If you are just
getting rid of text, that might not cause you so much difficulty.

The pagination problem might be more complex.  You can't just reflow
things in Postscript, that is the responsibility of something
upstream.  You may or may not be able to patch things up tractably in
the Postscript.

For full details, see Adobe's canonical _Postscript Language
Reference, 3ed_, Addison Wesley.  I think it is even online somewhere
these days.  Ah, yeah:

  <http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/PLRM.pdf>

Good luck.

I'm not sure about present day, because I haven't tested the UPS, but 
in the past the house would take momentary power hits, to the point 
that the answering machine and microwave would complain.  But, the 
computer and UPS kept humming along fine.

I really like that idea.  Unfortunately I'm running SCSI CDROM

I have been running tripwire religiously and looking at the
output every day.  That doesn't mean that I haven't been hacked
somehow, though it's supposed to help detect that.

My machine never powers down, and I haven't changed the BIOS in
I don't know how long.  At 6:32AM the machine is hard at work
finishing nightly cron stuff.

Only the CPU, DSL and POTS modems are on the UPS.  Printer,
scanner, monitor, etc are on the same ckt, but not plugged into
the UPS.

PGE installed a recorder on the power for my previous house when

~3PM every Monday. %-/ The problem appeared once in the time that
they had the monitor on my power and then went away for good
without explanation.

I think Scribus (http://www.scribus.net/) will import PS files and allow
you to edit them within reason.

There have been a couple of replies indicating that is is just text.  
Well it is usually, if you're lucky.  I have seen and had to give up
dealing with several PS files because the micro-spacing commands made
finding the text impossible (pre/early linux times and all the nifty
utilites that have come out of the Open Source movement.)

A quick look at the Scribus documentation turned up a mention of 
the pstoedit utility.  That might make editing easier.

  That's like using a 10-gauge shotgun to kill a fly.

  What I did was find where page 2 began and erase from there to the end of
that page. Worked just fine. Then I converted them all to pdf (headings and
all) and will incorporate the pdf files in the appendix of the report I'm
writing. No sense making a major production of this. :-)

  I appreciate Russell's pointer to the PS manual. I've avoided buying a
book on postscript because it's just more to learn that I don't use every
day.

Thanks all,

Are you on a subnet that can directly access 192.168.55.200?

Try changing your IP to 192.168.55.100 and then see if you're able to
get it.

  How do I change the IP address of the WAP without accessing it? Or, do you

If you're going to try accessing 192.168.1.1, try setting your IP to

Try returning it to the configuration (pre "I now have this unit ...")
and see if it works that way.  I don't quite follow how you have it
configured now.  Draw a picture, maybe?

getting a kernel that has been reliable for it.  (The apic bug has been

It doesn't require power problems to uncover a bad UPS battery. The
consistant reboot time could be caused by the UPS doing a battery
discharge test. If the battery is in really bad shape the UPS woule be
unable to switch back to AC power quickly enough and everything connected
dies briefly.

You said you didn't think it was a power problem, but you didn't say you
know the battery is good. How old is the battery (or batteries)?

Rob,

  Problem solved. I had the WiFi switch plugged into the shared port on the
wired switch; the one used to connect the two wired switches. When I moved
the WiFi switch to another port I was able to connect on the .200 address.

  Sigh. Thanks very much, all of you,

Maybe I was a bit too strong in my "don't think it's a problem".
I did put UPS testing on my list of things to try.  This UPS is 8
years old, as is its battery -- seems kinda old to me.  I have 2
other UPSes if I need them.

I also thought that Keith's Knoppix suggestion could be modified
for my situation.  I could leave the machine idling after booting
from floppy.  A reboot under those conditions could rule out a
lot of things.

Thanks everyone for your continued help on this....

If all else fails, you can always reset the WAP and set it up again.
This may be required if you made WAP changes that you didn't write down.

I will assume you have either the recommended WRT54G or BEFW11S4.  These
units are nearly identical for routing configuration.  It is easiest to
do all this with a single straight-through ethernet cable from your
setup machine to one of the WAP's 4 LAN connections.  I will refer to
the setup machine as SETUP.

Unless you made changes to the contrary, you can only access the Linksys
WAP from the LAN side, not the WAN side.  That means the router will
only talk configuration to addresses it believes are on the subnet
it controls.  If you set up the Linksys with 192.168.55.200 as a
configuration address, then it must also be configured so that
192.168.55.xx is part of the internal address space.  Also, SETUP
should be configured to route 192.168.55.xx to the ethernet connection
that is wired to the WAP.   The output of /sbin/route from SETUP would
be handy for debugging this.

You can test the connection with a PING to 192.168.55.200 .  If you 
get "no route to host" from SETUP, then you are not routing on SETUP
correctly.  If you get no response to the ping, then the WAP is on
a different address than you thought.  If you get a response to ping,
but no configuration web page, I suggest you try browsing to
http://192.168.55.200:8080 , which is an alternative port for the
configuration web page, and may have gotten enabled when you were
setting something else on that page.

If you decide to reset the WAP, write down what you do.  I can write
up the details of setting up the WAP from scratch, but I do not have
time now.

One such alias is "everyone", which, as you might guess, contains a list of everyone who has an email account on the server. The alias works for everyone except one user. In other words, if I send an email to everyone at mydomain.com (domain name has been replaced to protect the innocent), all the users in the everyone alias get the email except this one user. I have reviewed the /etc/postfix/aliases file and found no error. I have also tried moving the users name to a different location in the list of users for this alias and running newaliases, but still no luck. There is another alias that this user belongs to that works. Any ideas? How can I trace the distribution of an email with postfix? Can I turn on verbose logging or something? Is there a way to look into the aliases.db file, to see if there is an issue there?

Thanks,

Not true.  After all, you have to unplug the UPS to put the switch
in between, yes?  While I would not suggest hanging onto bare metal
on your computer while fiddling with the power cord, the computer is
grounded through the peripheral connections (which we are told are
not connected through the UPS).  The most unsafe part of the unplug
is what it might do software-wise, if the machine is poorly configured
and the UPS is in fact faulty.  And that can be remedied by doing
the unplug test while the machine is looking at the GRUB splash
screen, or some other unmounted condition.  

This crude test of the UPS tells us whether the problem is power side
or computer side.  Testing with Knoppix (if you can't boot from CD,
boot from a different distro on a swapped hard drive) tells us whether
the problem is hardware, or disk/software.   The point of all this is
isolating the fault to one segment of the problem space.  Without that,
we can speculate forever and come up with thousands of plausible fault
scenarios.  Speculation ends when empirical data collection begins.

Given the response to a reboot, and the response to alternate disk/software
we can make more intelligent suggestions for further testing.  Until
there is more data, the problem space is too large.  Debugging is 
intelligent data collection.  I have plenty more tests to suggest after
knowing the results of the UPS and the alternate software tests.

Did you check the logs to make sure that a message wasn't sent to 
him/her? I'm wondering if s/he has something morally equivalent to a 
procmail filter that's deleting or moving it.

The only procmail filter for this user is one that pipes mail through spamassassin. There is no filter to move or delete mail that is marked as spam and the users all share an autowhitelist database. None of the other users had my recent mail to everyone marked as SPAM. I looked through the logs for the users name and it looks like there was an email sent to this user around the time that I sent an email to the everyone alias, but the mail never made it into their inbox. It is likely that this log entry was for the message I sent, but there is no way I can tell for sure, is there?

After all the discussion about FC2 and problems with certain video drivers
I decided I would wait to upgrade my Desktop (with a NVIDIA video card)  
but I have an upcoming server upgrade from RHL 6.1 (or possible complete
new install) and was thinking of FC2 since the 2.6 kernel has some serious
performance improvements.
   I'll be checking the Fedora site in a bit but would appreciate any
input on using FC2 on older and plainer hardware.  It is an AMD-K6 3D
processor (450 Mhz), 256 MByte RAM and SCSI drives (HD and tape) with a
BusLogic Flashpoint LT host controller.  Oh yeah, IDE CDROM.


FWIW  :-)

Message-ID: <40B38D5C.4090404@robinson-west.com>

I can't get fsck to install.  I get errors about bzip2 every time I try 
to emerge.  Something about it being moved while it's being copied.
I am getting weird errors about directories under bzip2 in the portage 
tree not being files.  I'm stumped.

So far, this looks to be the only barrier to having a system that boots 
cleanly.  I didn't bother with setting a hostname permanently
or configuring /etc/hosts because this is a laptop.

Has anyone else had trouble with aggressive CFLAGS and gentoo?  What are 
working CFLAGS settings for the initial install?

I didn't have proc mounted when I first attempted the bootstrap.sh 
script.  I stopped the script, mounted proc, and restarted it.
I'm wondering if something got corrupted to the point of me having to 
start over.

Curiosity here...  I told my samba server to bind to 192.168.1.1 and 
127.0.0.1 bind interfaces only.
That doesn't seem to be working right since it breaks if I iptables 
block ports 137,138, and 139 on
my outside interface with a global ip on it.  I get errors on a lookup 
that it can't hit the broadcast
address of my global subnet.  This is very strange and frustrating 
behavior.  If this is normal, I guess
that noone should run any file server services on their gateways.

I've gotten what looks like a fraud email from E-Bay tonight.

I forwarded it to abuse at ebay.com and deleted it.  It claimed
that my Ebay account has been defrauded and looked very
legitimate except for the fact that spamassasin didn't like it
and it had an attachment.

This is the second really strange email that I've gotten in so
many days.  The first one was I'm some woman in St. Petersburg
Russia interested in doing web developement for your site.
Now this one.  Both of these strange emails appear to be blatant
attempts at social engineering, saying the right thing at the right
time to get information from me.  I forwarded the Russian one to
my ISP, they thought it was very clever.  What uses a .eml
file anyways?  Is that really plain text?

Airplanes have a black box.  This is the second red flag that something
might be wrong which has come up in a very short time period of
time.  Can I create an ethernet bridge with something like an old 386
 to detect any unusual traffic including alien protocols, etc, coming
off of my servers?  It may be that people who have been trying to send
me spam are retaliating against my recent anti spam upgrades.  I've
implemented SPF checking and greylisting.  I've also limited the
valid email addresses at my site that Internet clients can send to.  
Whoever sent this ebay thing sent it to an alias that I use for ebay
mail.

As far as reporting spam, how can you if the addresses in an email are
so easily forged?  If everyone uses SPF and SPF records can be
trusted, forged mail will be no more.  This list doesn't even use SPF
though.  It takes about five minutes to implement the necessary dns
TXT record.

The Ebay message claimed that I have been suspended, probably just
a ploy though.  Are hoaxes in general getting to be more convincing?

Between porn 49 and there's no way that that is superboy 32, why watch tv
at all?

Besides, I hear another option for bigscreen viewing is a projection screen,
like the ones used in classrooms at PCC and PSU, with a three color ceiling
mounted projector.  Big picture, hardly any space used.

There are some web broadcasts that are nice, but they generally call for 
more
than a 500k dsl line.  The biggest problem with television today is not even
being able to watch the news without worry of porn stories or steamy ads.  
The news is really awful about showing pictures and even worse about
hype, especially channel 8.  It was bad enough to get Cialis ads in my
inbox, now there is a tv ad advertising it.  I don't watch any TV, not even
pornTrek.

I've never worked with postfix, but there should be a message-ID in 
each log entry (that's the way it works in sendmail land, anyway). I 
typically track "lost" messages by that ID.

I think you need to start over and to follow the instructions.
I don't go for very agressive CFLAGS myself.  Some of the ebuilds do have
problems with them.

Watch your space on /var & /usr.  Both can get filled quickly.

Rod,

I too use putty to access my servers and the color comes up.  As much
as I like the color to quickly identify files.  Nice to see what is
executible.  The folder color and others by default have been a
challenge.  I have found that if I just change the hue of the blue in
Putty for that one connection then it is fine.  My problem has been
with ANSI Blue.  I just make it brighter.

Go into teh Window - Color section of Putty and change them.  You can
either set it while in that section by  clicking on the left upper
window bar and chossing 'change Settings' or you can do it permanently
by loading the save session and changing it in the options to the
left.

I fought with the color mappings on linux for many different
connections including telnet(windows and *inx), exceed, and putty.  I
just found changing the client to be easier and faster.

Head over to http://forums.gentoo.com and do a search
with the key words "Ino directory", and I think you'll
find that there are others with your same problem: 
too agressive CFLAG settings on previously compiled
binaries.

You may need to start over without these agressive
settings.

Um, I don't believe there are any broadcast stations in Portland between

Um, do you know what porn is?  (hint:  It's not on Channel 8.)

Why are you so afraid of seeing what other people do?

I mean, I don't condone a whole lot of what goes on in this world, both in
public and in private, but I'm not burying my head in the sand for fear of
catching a glimpse.

Pardon me if this is insensitive (perhaps you're some kind of recovering
addict -- like an alcoholic who can't go near a bottle for fear he'll lose
it and go on a bender), but it's really, really strange for a supposedly
adult person to be so bothered by the actions of strangers.

Just a little old for a UPS battery. 8 years old for a UPS battery is
ancient. Figure UPS batteries should be replaced about every 5 years or
so. Nice thing is that smart UPSes will tell you the battery needs to be
replaced, rather than having a dumb one die during a short outage, of
course then you have to heed its warning.

I'd also like to point out that a battery can't produce nearly the
current a wall outlet can. As the source of that energy is inside the
UPS, the UPS is more than capable of grounding all the power coming out
of it. You'll lose the ground you'd want to use for ESD, but you
shouldn't be unsafe.

A couple seconds to Google "eml" and "suffix" suggests this might be

Sure, but odds are you won't be able to distinguish unusual traffic from
legitimate traffic without a bit of work. What do you mean by "alien
protocols"? Do you mean non-IP traffic, like PIM or AH or OSPF or GRE or
anything else in /etc/protocols that isn't part of the TCP/IP suite?

Or do you just mean "bad stuff", whether it's ip or not? 

> It may be that people who have been trying to send me spam are

Pretty unlikely. It's not all about you.

It's about your email address finding its way into a list that contains
a few million other addresses, and that list gets sold from spammer to
spammer, all with the forlorn hope that 0.01% of the recipients will
actually think it's a fine idea to buy their drugs or pr0n or hot stock
tips or mortgage refi's from someone who advertises via spam.

> As far as reporting spam, how can you if the addresses in an email are
> so easily forged? 

If you really don't have better things to do with your time, then you
could look at the received lines, see whose ip address is in the last
"Received from:" line before your own systems, do a whois on that ip,
and send your complaints there.

Chances are it's going to be a compromised Windows system on cable or
dsl, and the owners have no clue that their peecee is being used to
relay spam.

I'd rather spend that time working my dog in agility, flyball, and
herding. Or spending time in the garden. Or helping my daughter with her
homework. Or about a zillion other things.

That is pretty much a function of your own skill at critical thinking

I was hoping to not have to do this as it is (as you mention below) a pain 
from all the clients I use to ssh into the servers.

Do this regularly -- the right click thingy -- then forget to fix it 
permanently when I have the PuTTY main window up.

I'm about half tempted to change the DIRCOLORS file and be done with it
but others tht ssh in might have an issue with that.


Thanks for the suggestions,

Subject: [PLUG] Fedora Core 2 (?)
Message-ID: <BAY9-F5fx5NDSbhewyW00034a1f@hotmail.com>

Between work and home, I have 4 linux boxes.  I have upgraded 3 of them 
already.
And yes, there are *substantial* performance improvement.  I only have
problem with one of the 3 boxes not having a working Nvidia driver.
Yes, that was annoying but performance improvement is quite substantial, I 
just leave that
box with the 2.6 kernel (but no X) as server.

The 2 boxes that upgraded just fine (with X supported well) is using Nvidia 
Riva TNT2 and ATI Rage 128 as video cards respectively.  The box with video 
card problem is using Quadro FX 500 from Nvidia.  Someone was saying that 
GeFORCE works fine under the 2.6 kernel.
My 4th box is a GeFORCE card and I have not been able to find time to do the 
upgrade.

Could you make a ~/.dircolors file, and then put in your profile / login script the running of dircolors with this particular file? You could set them all to white.

My kids and I like to watch Scooby-Doo, The Munsters and H.R. Puffinstuff. With MythTV recording the shows and cutting out the commercials I have to put up with much less commercial influence on the kids, which is great for everyone. They don't have to whine about things we are not going to go out and buy and I don't have to listen to it.

Unless you consider Three's Company to be porn (which you might, after all Jack does pretend to be gay in front of Mr. Roper), there really isn't any porn on basic cable TV. I haven't seen any porn related news since Boogie Nights was released in the theaters, which by the way was a great flick, especially if you like porn.

"
It may be that people who have been trying to send me spam are

retaliating against my recent anti spam upgrades.

Pretty unlikely. It's not all about you.
"

I was getting what looked to be targeted spam.  I suppose someone may
have chosen a user name out of thin air that made it look targeted.  I
use ebay quite a bit, it must have been harvested off of there.  Do
people actually get paid money after they sell you something on E-Bay
to provide your email address to spammers?  E-Bay could fix this
problem by having an address they control show up to the seller
anonymously forwarding messages to the buyer.  This way, E-Bay
sellers would get an E-Bay address instead of mine.  

I for one think there's nothing wrong with trying to get a question
answered locally instead of going to google all the time.  There was a
time when the thought of regional linux help centers was seen as
an ideal.  Anymore, I fear that google has wiped out the idea of
getting questions answered through such regional centers.  As far
as using google all the time, I see great value in a question answered
locally.  It doesn't matter if google knows, what matters is what you
and I now.

"
It's about your email address finding its way into a list that contains
a few million other addresses, and that list gets sold from spammer to
spammer, all with the forlorn hope that 0.01% of the recipients will
actually think it's a fine idea to buy their drugs or pr0n or hot stock
tips or mortgage refi's from someone who advertises via spam.
"

So it doesn't matter where it comes from or who sent it.  The fingers
of the buyers of those lists along with the fingers of the sellers of those
lists need to be broken!  Course I'm not serious, but there should be a
way to proactively get out of other people's databases and enforced
laws regulating the collection of statistics about what disinterested
parties are doing.

Aside from this...

What bothers me more than spam is how electronic transfer works.  You
don't have to provide a code for paypal to write an  e-check against your
account.  My bank won't offer me a way to explicitly sign these transfer
requests either.  Paypal bounced my account three times when  I
accidentally set the payment method to check instead of credit.  At $22 a
bounce, that really hurt.  I've attempted to set the default to credit, but
paypal puts me on a page that essentially dicourages that and puts the
primary payment method back to check.  Add to that that some auctions
require direct transfer, taking the checking account off of paypal isn't so
easy.  I put it on when a seller required me to verify and it has been a
nightmere ever since.  I wonder if any banks are better about this than
Washington Mutual is?  It's harder for me to walk in to a branch and
withdraw funds than it is for someone to go after those funds 
electronically.  
That is just wrong.

I use Ebay because I'm after hard to find items including: 32 pin simms and
DIMMS from the pc100 and pc133 days.

Why are UPN 49, WB32, and Fox 12 becoming so degraded?  Most cable and 
satellite television sources in my experience don't give their customers 
choice of
programming.  If they charge you exorbitently for it, it's really not 
worth it.  I'd like to see more useful stations.  How about a station 
devoted to how
to's for Linux administrators?  So many people are looking for 
information on how to do the same things, it could be a really nice 
service.  The other thing that
bothers me about the media today is that it hasn't diversified enough. 
 There is a small ethnic slice in most programming it seems.  The 
tendency in sitcoms
seems to be toward liberal and egalitarian value systems.  It's not just 
what is shown that's sad, it's the attitudes displayed which are in some 
ways worse.
I bet the islamic world would view us more favorably if we'd stop 
producing so much offensive programming.  Cleaner programming at home 
would make
it easier to win the peace abroad by improving our reputation.

I was pleasantly surprised at how well PuTTY emulated an xterm when
accessing a Linux system, color and all.  But if you don't like it,
there should be a setting for terminal type or answerback.  Change it
from 'xterm' to a terminal that doesn't support color, such as 'vt220'
or 'vt102'.  You can even play with it from a terminal session with e.g.
"export TERM=vt220".

Good luck,

"I get errors" is about as useless as it gets.  Yeah, I have fsck on my
gentoo system.  Yeah, it installed without any problems.

Copy and paste the error, would you?

I would strongly suggest setting a hostname anyway... Linux doesn't like
walking around without a name.

Way back when I first gave Gentoo a try, I think I did have a few
problems with overly aggressive C[XX]FLAGS causing unstable binaries.

After doing a little bit of research on how much the CFLAGS really did
for me, though, I toned things down considerably and have found the
system is generally in better shape with everything running nice and
stable like.  :-)

Most ebuilds that will have problems with common CFLAGS filter them out
these days (they didn't back when I was getting started).

Um, yeah... those twelve people that don't know how to use Google would

The information you're describing is best left to on-demand media like the
web.

Oh, you mean how deregulation and lax public interest requirements of the
FCC have led to there being only five media companies that control all of
broadcast and cable television in not just this country but the world?

I'm with ya, there, buddy.  That's a real bother.  The same rich, white
conservatives at the helm of every media company.

> There is a small ethnic slice in most programming it seems.

Well, it's getting better.  At least now you can see blacks on TV that
aren't The Jeffersons or the Huxtables.  Of course, even "reality
television" woefully under-represents the poor and disenfranchised that
make up a much larger percentage of the population than the executives,
lawyers, doctors, and politicans that are so woefully over-represented.

Yeah, we, in the western world, call that "The Enlightenment".  It's a
path we started down about four hundred years ago as a more rational,
positive response to other popular movements of the day like "The
Inquisition".

Really, you're right.  I'm sure if our value system more closely
represented the Taliban, we wouldn't have all these problems!

Burn the televisions!  Cut off the hands of criminals (and just break the
fingers of the annoying spammers)!  Bandage those women from head to toe
so as not to tempt the men into sin!

Wow... Michael, you really do support all of those Taliban doctrines,
don't you?

Kinda gives me the jibblies.

Tapal raping commander Tucker is close enough, if you really must
know.  The way the Abu Gharaib prison scandal has been reported
has been insensitive.  One minute you're watching to find out what a
public official is saying when, without warning, pictures are shown.

If any of these prisoners are innocent, think just how cruel showing
those pictures is.  I think everyone knows that that is hard on a
muslim prisoner.  The sad thing about the whole
scandal is, it only takes one unit in the military for a scandal this size
to hit the news.  It says to me that the news is looking for something
wrong instead of reporting the large number of good things that are
happening.  You can't predict deriliction of duty in the ranks.
It's ultimately the commander in the field and sometimes a
private that need to be responsible.  I was ordered to do it is never
a valid excuse, for a military that has a code of honor.

In all likelihood, this probably happened in World War II and other
wars that people are so nostalgic about also.  Today, it's reported
differently.

have gained power because noone wants to balance them with the

I was bragging of my 180 day uptimes (three in a row) to a friend who
works for a university in Germany.  He proceeded to show me his SGI box
with an 850 day uptime....

And it isn't where it was when it was turned on.

He said two men to carry the box, four to carry the UPS.  Yup, they
unplugged the UPS and carried the system, running, to its second
location.  And it survived without any problems.  :-)

Show me a system with a 800-day uptime and I'll show you a system

War is insensitive.

Sorry you have to be confronted with the brutal reality of the violence
you support.  I suppose it DOES make it very hard to continue to support
war when you are constantly reminded of the stark inhumanity of the acts
required to maintain dominance by physical violence.

If any of those people are innocent, think how cruel it would be to not

We don't learn by turning our heads away and discussing it in the

Like all the people that are being killed with bullets instead of
broomsticks?  Like the women and children that are being bombed instead of
raped and tortured?  Like the conversation of an entire nation to a
prison-state instead of just one obvious prison complex?

Yeah, too bad our military has never had one of those.  You'll find that
the current administration is working very hard to stop the problems that
lead to this scandal... but perhaps they disagree with most Americans as
to what the problem was.  It seems that the administration believes this
to be a security problem:  the information about the torture was supposed
to be kept secret from the people.  They're busy plugging holes in the
secrecy network instead of working to stop violence and brutality.  Of
course, purging their ranks of torturers, sadists, and misanthropes would
leave them on, at best, a skeleton crew... with no experienced leadership.

That's more of that "Enlightenment" I was telling you about earlier.  See,
as time passes, we are learning that the purpose of civilization is to
minimize suffering and it is a contradiction to think that violence is a
means to that end.

Whom would Jesus bomb?

Um, no.  I'm not afraid of reading your paranoid ranting nor your holy war
rhetoric.  I don't skip the list just because there's somebody out there
saying things I don't want to hear.  But perhaps that's indicative of the
real difference, here.  I don't want to hear those things because I don't
want people to actually believe them.  So I have to know they exist in
order to know how we've failed to educate and enlighten.  I think perhaps
you don't want to hear or see the things you don't condone because you
want to pretend they don't exist and hope that ignorance becomes
widespread enough that the ideas are lost to history.  This is, again, the
difference between the Enlightenment and the Dark Ages that preceeded
(when knowledge was withheld from the people and, as a result, posterity
suffered the loss of history).

> Oh I'm sorry, you're the guy who can't get in any person's way even if

Well, I don't have a car or any money, so I certainly couldn't get in any
person's way of taking those things from me.

If you'd listen and watch, you'd find that I'm deeply principled and work
very hard to adhere to those principles every day and in every way.

> abusers.

No, worrying about them isn't strange.  Worrying without accepting their
reality and working toward rational means of relieving their suffering is
pretty darned strange, though.

> It's against my values to see certain acts that I consider private.

How can it be against your values to SEE something?  Surely your values
cannot dictate passive behavior.  If I were to stand outside your house
with a banner depicting "certain acts" (whatever those may be) and you
were to look out the window, would you consider that a failure to adhere
to values?

Furthermore, how are you to learn about others' acts, behavior and
motivation, without observation?  It seems that ignorance would only
re-enforce social ailments for lack of open dialog to diagnose flaws or
objectively interpret scenarios.

> Too many liberals dominate the public ear and have gained power because

> sound value systems.

See, that's more of that muddle-headedness that sometimes comes out in
your attempts to diagnose technical problems.  There are such a thing as
"liberal ideals" and "progressive values".  Many of those systems are quit
sound, mature, healthy, and rewarding.  But because the fundamental
defining characteristic of "liberals" is that they are simply NOT
conservative.  There's really only one way to be conservative -- to adhere
to the shared mythology of some ideal of ignorance and repression (for
what else could "conservative" mean if not going backward in learning and
what could an opposition to "liberalism" mean if not being for more
repression?), but there are an infinite number of ways to NOT be that one
way.  Perhaps it's difficult for the conservative mind to grasp the idea
of infinite choice -- that ideals can be chosen rationally (or randomly!)
from the infinite possibilities of reality and not merely be handed down,
whole and unquestionable, by the Authorities of the previous generation.
But that's how it is.  There is no one set of "liberal values", but
liberalism does not imply a lack of values.

Uh... what kernel was that thing running?  uptime is tracked not by some
subtraction of datestamps, but by adding the current date to the number of
ticks since the system started.

I guess if the system was REALLY slow, there might be fewer than 32K ticks
in 850+ days.  But at 100hz, 32K ticks is something like 500 days.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

Yeah, I've done it a number of times on my (other) PCG-68P.  I ran into
a similar problem where, after I'd take out every single screw I could
find, I still couldn't get it open.  The culprit turned out to be a
rather cantankerous sticker on the inside of the case, undoubtedly there
to prevent you from pretending you didn't just void your warranty ;-P 
However, cracking the case wasn't necessary  on my laptop as there was a
somewhat hidden hard-drive access panel on the bottom.  Not sure if
you're in the same boat, but poke around for a while and make sure
you've removed every single screw, there are undoubtedly a number of
hidden ones.  Often times innocent looking rubber feet will actually
hide screws.  Occasionally there will be one under a sticker (but
usually not and you can typically tell without removing the sticker). 
Of course, YMMV.

Basically, Sony goes to a lot of trouble to keep you out, and for good
reason.  In my experience there is usually an easier way of accessing
both the hard drive and memory that actually opening up the entire case.

How old is that Vaio?

Most laptops have hard drive access panels of some sort on the bottom...
you rarely need to dig into the guts.  Of course, I've never ripped open
a Vaio.

I have a friend who replaced his hard drive in his Vaio a few years ago,
he didn't have any issues, but I didn't see it.

Did Google know anything about it?

Paul,

  In northern Germany the days are very short -- particularly during the
winter. So, it doesn't take that long to accummulate an impressive uptime.

I'm using a PCG-FX200 series.
The Vaio that I replaced the hard drive on didn't open from the bottom.
I had to remove the speaker bar on top, then the keyboard from the top.
Once that was out of the way, there was capture brackets that held the 
drive in place.

BTW, FC1 installed just fine with the new drive I put in the Vaio.

Subject: [PLUG] events/0 chewing up CPU time
Message-ID: <1085527919.7008.65.camel@localhost>

Hey list-

I upgraded to 2.6.6 a few days ago and am really liking it, except for
one small problem.  When I close the lid to my laptop, events/0 starts
eating all the available CPU time it can.

Google is turning up next to nothing.  It seems somebody had a similar
problem with one of the 2.6.0-pre releases and somebody else thought
unexpected ACPI events could potentially cause events/0 to run away.

I guess they were right.

This is a Dell Inspiron 2650 using the i8k modules.  ACPI is enabled
(and controlling my CPU speed).  2.6.2 did *not* do this, with a nearly
identical .config (which can be seen at http://rob.axpr.net/configfile).

Nothing much is appearing in dmesg (http://rob.axpr.net/dmesg), either.

I don't know how to further diagnose this.  What is events/0, exactly? 
I'm pretty sure it's a kernel thread, but beyond that I'm a bit
stumped.  :-)

Any thoughts on a solution?

Rob

Well, if it's running irix, then it's probably a 64 bit kernel.

  I have a Vaio PCG-V505BC. When I doubled the RAM I took the machine to
Northwest Computer Support. I can confirm that the system disassembles from
the top because I had to make a second trip there so they could seat the
keyboard properly.

Hmm, not the right model: http://www.divideby0.com/photos/vaio-f280
Though if I remember right there was something funky about the hinge
assembly there, that might help.

Hear, Hear!  There seems to be an unhealthy fascination with long up 
times.  I'm firmly convinced that with a good hard platform beneath it 
  a linux/unix os is remarkably stable.  Incidentally, I do remember 
seeing sometime ago a screenshot of a Novell Netware 3.12 server showing 
over 2200 days of run time.

Keith,

  I think that was the one left behind a wall -- working away -- when
offices were remodeled. The construction folks didn't bother notifying
anyone that the machine was there so they framed and sheetrocked the area.
It was only when there was a problem and the company couldn't find the
offending machine that they followed the cables and learned what happened.

Courier IMAP and Postfix server...

Outlook has been configured to save sent messages on the IMAP server...
A week after making the changes on the client to store messages on the
server, the CPU load stays at just under 100% caused by IMAP processes
owned by each connecting user...
No other server/client system changes have been made in the past week
prior to the increased CPU load...

The box is a 2.4GHz Xeon with 2GB RAM

Any ideas could be causing the huge IMAP load?  I don't see any problems
in the logs...

There has to be a way to tune it up later, or maybe it won't be that big

The colorization is meant to help you distinguish different parts of the 
text
from each other logically.  Blue when looking at your filesystem for
example means directory.  I think that only vim is colorized in Redhat,
you should be able to use vi instead and get black and white.  The other
trick that may work is changing your ls alias and .vim.* file.  I can't
remember what vim's initialization file is called exactly.

I would at the very least set -O2 and -march, then -msse, sse2, whatever
is appropriate for your CPU.  -fomit-frame-pointer is usually safe.  If
your system has SSE support, setting -mfpmath=sse should result in
faster binaries.

All of those should be safe for most every package.  Anything it won't
be safe for will filter it out in the ebuild.

And as to tuning it up later... sure you can, you just recompile
everything.  Guess how long that takes......

And it sounds like you should not watch any TV until you grow up.

"pornTrek"???  You have got to be kidding me?  If you think what passes
for Star Trek these days is Porn, then you need to watch some real porn
to figure out the difference.  

Big hint:  One is people having sex to cause sexual arousal in the
viewer and the other is flogging a dead franchise to make a few more
bucks off of Rodenberry's spinning corpse.  If you are getting aroused
watching Star Trek, you need serious therapy.

Actually if mentioning sex cause you as much distress as it appears they
do, then you really do need some help. Sex is a part of being a mature
adult.  If seeing or hearing it mentioned causes you discomfort, then
you have a sexual dysfunction that you need to deal with, in one way or
another. Most well-adjusted people are able to see it, and if it does
not interest them, move on.

Unfortunately there are people who are trying to inflict your neurosis
on the rest of society at large.  They need to get a grip as well.

As well as w3m, which I found in the past handled tables best of the
three.

And if you *are* running a gui in the form of xterms (or other term of
choice) in X, w3m can be configured to display inline images within the
terminal window as well.

I've not taken apart a 505tr but I've taken apart my z505hs to replace 
the HD using this guys documentation of it:
   http://modular.fas.harvard.edu/z505he/apart/

It wasn't very difficult and if your case is similar to mine it 
shouldn't take you less than 30 minutes to open it, replace the HD and 
close it if you've never done it before.  A bonus is that nothing on my 
sony's case was "snapped" together in a way that you'd break off a 
crucial-yet-extremely-fragile tab while taking it apart or putting it 
back together.

This page links to several other laptop disassembly pages for other sony 
models that might be more similar to your laptop than a z505:

They do, but not down to the per channel basis.  There are people
working on that.  If it happens, there is talk that it will kill off
most of the less popular channels.

TechTV had Linux related programming.  "Market forces" pretty much
killed it off.  It was bought by Comcat and is being merged with G4TV.

There are programs that reflect your value system.  They are on PAX.

They are also dreadfully BORING.

Like mentioning sex and all that naughty stuff?  Too bad.  Unless you
kill off 95% of TV executives (not a bad idea really), you will not get
very far in changing things.

"Clean" shows do not tend to get good ratings unless they are well
written.  Well-written TV shows are few and far between now-a-days. 
(Especially since the networks want to own the shows and micromanage
everything that goes on.)

Oh bullshit!

That is probably the dumbest thing I have heard you say yet!

First of all,  our TV shows are one of the few things the Islamic world
LIKES about the US.  (When they can see it.  The Mullahs hate our TV as
much as you do.)

Second, have you ever seen what gets shown on TV in the rest of the
world?  Monty Python (in England) had full frontal nudity on occasion! 
TV from Europe is much more raw than anything you will see here.  In
France they show actual Porn on broadcast TV.  (Not just the softcore
crap we show on cable.)  Even Canada shows stuff that could never get
shown on regular TV.  (Like "Puppets Who Kill" and "The Mr. Hell show".)

The only countries that are as puritanical as the US are the religiously
ruled Islamic countries and many Communist countries.

The way we stop making enemies out of Islamic countries is to NOT BOMB
THEM.  (As well as getting them laid more often.  Sexually frustrated
males are a BIG problem in Islamic countries right now.)

Ahh! Ahh! w3m!

It even does that inline images thing (HOW do they do that?) in

You are wrong.

All time is kept that way internally.  System speed has nothing to do
with the uptime numbers.  (Expect in cases where the number rolls over
due to being in a too small numeric type.  And it has happened...)

If they have not rebooted in 850 days, then they have a whole bunch of
security issues to deal with.

Uugh.  PAX not only runs The Weakest Link, it *is* the weakest link!
The only show worth watching on that network is /That 70's Show/, and
even then the only ones on PAX are the ones that Fox got tired of
rerunning into oblivion.

Hopefully the useless ones nobody watches that the cable company uses
to pad out the bill.  You know, like The Weather Channel, Univision,
Telemunundo, Golf Network, etc.  I almost said "KOIN," but we can all
hope for a good disaster that leaves the entire city unharmed save for
the KOIN tower, and then something major enough to restore the view of
the mountain to the rest of downtown.  Why should we move around KOIN?
They're the ones who suck...

/Invader Zim/ was well written, original and funny.  Nickelodeon
micromanaged it to death, then cancelled it at the peak of it's
popularity midway though the first season...so we only know the first
one-fifth of the story...

I can't believe I read it myself.  Maybe if we kept our military to
ourselves on our own soil for defense instead of picking fights in the
Arabian desert we might have some respect in that part of the world.

And to everyone else that offered suggestions I'll expand.  I like 
non-white or black backgrounds so I use a grey but even with a black 
background some of the colors tend to fuzz-out a bit making it really 
difficult read the output.
   The yellow in vi (vim?) is one of the worst and the green used in the
ls/ll listings runs second.  All in all I'm pretty darn happy with black
on grey ie. no colorization for most of what I do.  I'm going to look at
Aaron's suggestion and move back in time to a vt102 emulation and see how
that works.

Thanks to evryone for the suggestions.

Sure, if the update is to a module. Just "modprobe -r" the module, put 
the update in place, and modprobe the new one.

Of course, if the updated module is for your root filesystem (e.g., 
ext3) or your main drive subsystem (scsi_mod or its descendants), then 
an update in place will be somewhat difficult. :-/

To me, uptime isn't all that meaningful a figure as long as the number 
and frequency of the downtimes remain reasonable. Unplanned and 
too-frequent downtimes are the real buggers.

Subject: [PLUG] MWVLUG Site Tests
Message-ID: <1085589587.17939.94.camel@localhost>

All,

I have upgraded MWVLUG's bandwidth and would like to make certain that
it is reliable and  see how it performs under a load. Would you mind
hitting the site and poking around?

Here's the link:

  http://www.mwvlug.org

Note that there may be a slight miss in connection. It may happen, for
example, that clicking on  a link does not come up until the second time
the link is clicked. 

The reason this may happen is that I will be "pulling cables" this week
to simulate conditions of failing bandwidth. The idea, of course, is to
ensure that GenCom's link to the Internet is reliable even during a
bandwidth failure.

P.S. Remember, MWVLUG's site is _your_ site. Feel free to contribute
local meetings, news, anything Linux and Open Source related.


Thanks!


Best,

Subject: [PLUG] old tape formats
Message-ID: <20040526171324.GA2771@gate.kl-ic.com>

I have some 12 year old tape images made by Novaback, a backup program
for DOS and Windoze.  The bits are intact, but the original tapes,
drives, machines, and software that made these images are long gone.
(Some years ago, I dd'ed the ancient DC300 tapes onto newer media, and
have images for those that did not erupt in brown vapor).

Now I want to get at a file I made in 1992.  While I have the Novaback
image, as bits, I don't have a program to take it apart.  I imagine I
could decode the backup file format and eventually write a program to
extract the file, but perhaps somebody in the world has already done this.

Any suggestions where to look for programs, or just the tape format?

Keith

----
BTW, I have done this with other, even older tape formats.  It is a
fun puzzle to solve, but it is time consuming and I don't have the
time right now.  I can still read old DUMP and TAR images from the
same era, so this is another reason why open source and open standards
are superior to proprietary standards.

Message-ID: <20040526174057.CCB5D4064@joseph.doink.com>

I let my problem child computer run overnight after booting from
a tomsrtbt floppy.  It rebooted just as before, which I believe
tends to indicate that my installed OS and disk drives are not
likely the culprit to the reboots.  Then while sitting at the
computer my house experienced a brief power hit, not even long
enough to reset the microwave clock.  But the UPS barfed and the
computer shut down.  Just a couple months ago this didn't happen.
The UPS I have is old enough, as is the monitoring software, that
I didn't get any software warning of a low battery condition.  I
thought to check the turn-on time of my programmable thermostat.
It's set for 2 minutes before reboot time.  I'm in a sea of
circumstantial evidence!

I'll be replacing my UPS.  It turns out that APC has a trade-up
program, and I can trade in all 3 (different brands) of my weak
UPSs for new APC units.  They pay for shipment of the old ones
back to them, and I pay for shipment of the new units to me.

Thanks for the help folks.....

Message-ID: <16564.52460.378931.37688@eris.dischordia.net>

Man... every once in a great while, something just _works_.... and
having dealt with computers, including everything from avionics
to ASICs, for approximately 22 years, I get really excited when 
something just works.  So, I apologize for this OT spam; but, I
have to get this off my chest.

I wanted to listen to my (quite large) collection of mp3s from my
laptop on the patio.  So, I thought I'd give NFS a try.  After
literally 2 minutes looking at the exports and nfsd man pages, it was
working beautifully.  (Yes, I know there are other applications that
stress NSF... but, don't let the bad totally cloud out the good.)

I guess I'll have to send another check to SPI.

====================================

On Tuesday, June 8, Richard M. Stallman, founder of the GNU Project and
Free Software Foundation, will give a speech in Lincoln Performance Hall
at Portland State University: "The Free Software Movement and the
GNU/Linux Operating System."  He will discuss the purpose, goals,
philosophy, methods, status, and future prospects of the GNU operating
system, which in combination with the kernel Linux is now used by an
estimated 17 to 20 million users world wide.  There will be a
question-and-answer session afterwards.  The event begins at 7:00 PM,
and will last approximately three hours.  Lincoln Hall is located on the
Portland State University Campus in Portland at the corner of Broadway
and Market Streets.

Jeme,

  Are you extending the invitation to Microsoft resellers in the Portland
metropolitan area? That might be a more appropriate audience than the
already converted. How about SCO vars?

Josh,

  "wish" is the Tcl shell program. You should have it in /usr/bin.

I'd suggest talking to the Novaback people.  Proprietary backup
software sucks for just this reason.  I've got (or had) some old tapes
in something probably even more horrible than Novaback.  Luckily, the
data itself is also present in a nice reliable tar format.

I have recently rediscovered a QIC drive (and ISA interface cards)
that I thought were long gone.  If you think those parts might help
you out (not clear how they would), let me know and we might be able
to get you together for a date.

Rich,

That is what I thought but it is not on the system.  This is a new
Fedora Core 2 machine which I installed almost everything. :-)

Places to look  for it?  I do have the RPM package of:
tcl-8.4.5-7

I see that fedora split up the tktcl package into:

"tcltk ? Package split up into separate expect, tcl, tclx, tix and tk
packages"

Thus I bet I don't have the one that now has 'wish' in it.  Now that
is poor.  Oh well, Off to find the package and read where it is now.

It's part of Tk.  Look for wish8.3 (or whatever).  If your locate
database is up to date, just do "$ locate wish".

Josh,

  The 'what-provides' option to rpm should reveal in which package wish was
placed. If the package provider left it out then he should be made aware of
that fact.

Thanks.  I did figure it out.  TK was not installed.  Now here is an
odd thing.  I had first selected 'Everything' to install then after
seeing that was 6GB I decided to not do that and just select items
that I wanted installed.  So going though it all I actually ended up
selected everything that was selectable from the above install list
and this was only 4GB.  HMM.

Okay, what they list as 'Everything' is a lot different then if you
actually select everything from the options.  Don't get that at all. 
Very odd if you ask me.

But I did get TK, TIX, and TCLX installed.

Thanks,

Josh

Thanks Rich.  That is a great piece of knowledge.  Of course mine was
saying. "Nothing provides wish"  :-(

Fixed that.

I've been told that the stepchild distributions like Fedora and RedHat
have greatly improved their package management.... The guy who told me
that is one I trust enough such that his comment _almost_ sparked me
to try out RedHat again... The package mgmt was the primary reason I
always recommended Debian (back when people used to ask me about such
things ;-).

Is it true or false that the package mgmt on those systems is greatly
improved?  For those of you who use both Debian and the RPM-based
distribs, are they as good as Debian now?

Having toasted my Fedora test install, I'd say that it isn't as
reliable as Debian's yet.

I am trying to help a client diagnose an FTP problem (DOS FTP isn't
opening a ftp-data connection to a particular host).  I've got a linux
box on his network and I want to use it to sniff his FTP sessions to
figure out what is going wrong.  I assume his ActionTech DSL modem
acts like a switch and can be forced into hub mode, which will allow
my sniffing attempts to capture his connections.  What is a good tool

Nope. NetWare. It's a surprising OS that doesn't seem much time in the

I don't envy your quest to get that modem to work. However, you might
try "literal pasv" at the DOS FTP prompt to force passive mode, which
doesn't attempt alternate callback connections or such.

That's what Debian's distributing, I don't know about others.

Certainly makes it easier for people to know what they're getting once
you're also distributing GNU/Hurd and whatever else.

Although that may be asking for trouble. Use a cygwin CLI FTP client
instead?

Thanks for the suggestions!

I remembered and tried "macof" from the dsniff toolkit, which is
supposed to blow the switches ARP table and push it into hub mode.  It
didn't seem to work.  I hammered the switch, but never saw the ftp
traffic from my linux box.

The other idea I had was to put ethereal on a w2k box and run the DOS
FTP client from there (but I am not onsite at the moment).  The
ActionTech actually does the right kind of connection tracking.  I can
run (linux netkit) ftp in normal (non-passive) from the linux box to
aracnet.com through the ActionTech and it works fine.  I switch to
passive mode and that works too.  When he tries connecting to his
host, it doesn't work with DOS FTP, but does work with WSFTP (but that
is undesirable for other reasons).

The DOS FTP program doesn't have a passive mode option.  The "literal
pasv" thing is something to try though.

Cygwin is probably too invasive a workaround in this case.

Thanks!

It's a project, not a midterm or a quiz.  Technically, if you read a

Subject: [PLUG] Movie trailers
Message-ID: <1085622904.18120.26.camel@d8qbcf21.comcast.net>

I was demonstrating some features of Linux to our son-in-law last night.
All was going well until he asked me to play a movie trailer for
spiderman 2. He led me to a link at movies.yahoo.com, quite long so I
won't paste it into the email. When I click on the link, a window pops
up titled "Media Helper" that supposedly scans my system looking for the
appropriate plugin. After a bit it asks me to choose my player and
connection speed, with two choices. 1. Windoze media player
2. Real Player (but the button for this selection is grayed out.)
I messed around with it for a bit and got it to accept Real Player, but
then it claims there is no matching stream for my default settings.
I have realplayer 8 installed, as well as Kaffeine, and Noatun. I have
three browsers; Konqueror, Galeon, and Firefox. I have been unable to
configure any of them to play the trailer. I tried copying the link and
then opening the URL in each or the media players with no luck. Today I
received this link in an email:
http://www.thedayaftertomorrow.com/trailer2/
I was hoping the problem was related to Yahoo, but evidently not.

TIA,

  Mel

People have tried doing hot kernel swapping.  It is pretty hard to do
and VERY experimental.  I have not seen anything on it in the last year
or so, so i have no idea how far they got.

I use version 2.60 - worked well for
http://www.thedayaftertomorrow.com/trailer2/

which is Quicktime - for some reason I'm having trouble with Media
Player videos - I can only hear the sound.

Have fun,

Hey List-

I need to set up an IM server with 'shared roster' or 'groups' support. 
Jabber is perfect for this, but such functionality (the shared roster)
doesn't currently exist in a working form.

Are any of you aware of any other IM packages out there, I'm maybe even
willing to dive into closed-source land if necessary, that might offer
such features?

Any experience with them?  It looks like either PeopleLink or Akeni
would do the job, albeit quite expensively.

I'm going to keep looking, but would appreciate input if y'all have
some.  :-)

If you're like me and your connection speed is too slow for the quality
you want, you might want to just download the movie. This is difficult
for windows and realplayer urls (they use their own streaming protocol -
use mencoder), but the quicktime video on that site is an http download.
Just look at the source.

If your connection is fast enough, then the mplayerplug-in is probably
the best bet.

Could you elaborate for the list what exactly you mean? Selected
preset groups of people you can broadcast a message to at a whim?
I.e., a sort of "mailing list" for IM?

Certainly clients can already do this, but I imagine you don't want to
set up the same groups in clients a dozen times, eh?

I'm sorry, it's been a LONG last couple of days.  :-)

The 'shared roster' or 'shared group' or 'predefined group' works like
this...

Everybody in group A subscribes to the Group A group.  Now they're on
that list and that list is in their contact list.  Now to set up their
contact list, they just subscribe to the proper group and it's done,
they don't have to subscribe to each individual person.

An example might be if Jabber.org had a PLUG group.  We could all
subscribe to the PLUG group instead of everybody emailing everybody
their JIDs... and we'd all be on each others' group rosters.

Jabber 1.4 has such support, called mod_groups, but it doesn't seem to
work anymore, you lose yoursubscription when you log off.  :-\

Message-ID: <393-58004@sneakemail.com>

I recently thought I take the plunge and upgrade from my aging PIII system
to a fancy new AMD Athlon 3200.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to get the
motherboard (Gigabyte GA-7N400 Pro2 rev 2.0) and the memory (2x Kingston
KVR400X64C25/512) to play together nicely.

When running single channel (64 bit memory path) Memtest86+ v1.11 runs
flawlessly, however as soon as I reconfigure for dual channel (128 bit
memory path) I start seeing errors.  I've swapped both motherboard and
memory yet the problems persist.

I figure I have some options:
  1) Reduce the memory bus frequency so it works
  2) Try the expensive HyperX "matched" RAM
  3) Try Crucial's CAS 3 RAM (vs 2.5 on Kingston's, maybe slower timings
     help?)

Has anyone else had issues with their nForce2 boards running dual channel?
What did you do to solve the problem?

Some war hero, why doesn't he support body armor for
the troops among other essential supplies?  A lot of
brave people didn't serve in Vietnam, U.S. troops were
so unpopular at the time that it could have been very
difficult to be on the homefront.  Iraq isn't Vietnam
at this point, Kerry can make Iraq another Vietnam
though.

Kerry lies about what he believes and he frequently talks
out of two sides of his mouth depending on which
audience he is with.  As far as calling Bush a drug addict,
he isn't.  Bush in fact has actively worked to provide more
help to addicts.  Bush hasn't lied about having "had" a drug
problem.  Bush tells you what he believes whether you like
it or not.  Kerry doesn't.

There's a saying, "pushy Bush and scary Kerry."  There's a
lot of truth in that.

People put little messages on the end of their emails that
aren't Linux related and most of the time there wouldn't
be a response like this.  It's about time someone balanced
some of those little messages.  You wouldn't attack this
on the list if you didn't believe in seeing points pushed
here that suit you over ones that don't.

If you have an open mind, you'll look for any truth
in my Kerry statement and consider if there is some wisdom
that can culled from it.  Kerry deserves criticism for claiming
to be what he is not and for misleading different groups of
voters on his stands just to please them.

When the USS Maine blew up and we got into the war of 1812
everyone though it had been hit by a torpedo.  The truth is, it
was an accidental igniting of coal dust in the engine room.  
Yellow journalism was responsible for getting us into that war.
Consider, there aren't any completed investigations into what
happened at Abu Gharaib nor any concrete evidence
of abuses at the Guantanomo prison.  However, the press
is convinced there are human rights abuses and is reporting as if
this is certain.  Some detainees have been
held a long time and that there need to be limits on the enemy
combatants rules, but we've really never done anything about
terrorism in this country that has defined an enemy combatant
classification adequately.

Bush gets unfairly and harshly criticised.  He is working
with the constraints of a legal system that has never been
tuned for the occasional need to hold people under minimal
cause.  We decided we had to hold a lot of Japanese Americans
in WWII, at the time noone could have known that that was
wrong.  To a certain degree, we're doing the same thing now
because we haven't solved the problem of finding those who
pose a real threat to the nation out of a larger group that's by
and large innocent and patriotic.

There are calls for Rumsfeld's resignation.  Anyone who believes
without a doubt that he ordered the atrocities knows a different guy
than I do.  It is the President's job if Rumsfeld hides inhumane
programs from him to determine that and replace him.  
This is neither the job of the press nor anti bush individuals who
aren't particularly concerned  that proper trials and hearings get
held.  Those who commited the atrocities are guilty.  Those who
ordered them too commit atrocities are guilty.  Justice demands
that truth prevail over the political ambitions of the Bush
administration's detractors.

There are lot of factors that make Bush look bad because our system
has never had to go through what it's going through now.  The nation
was hurt, but there isn't the purpose that was there for WWII.  I don't
think it was there even for our actions in Afghanistan.  The real problem
is that people haven't come to grips with the reality that our nation will
have to be involved in military actions abroad in the future.  There also
isn't the realization that justifications for war will seem less 
suitable as
newer technology brings atrocities to us sooner.  As a result of rapid
warfare tactics. the chances for innocent civilians to get out of the way
is less.  The public more and more isn't accepting any of the costs of war.
This is not realistic.

Kerry has not demonstrated strong moral character to me.  AlQuaeda
attacks this country when it is weak, six months after Bush took office
for example.  With AlQuaeda growing and a clear need to provide security
in Iraq as long as the Iraqis want it, stability and strength are what is
needed.  We don't need an administration change right now.

Liberal, if it means lie to the American people and tear down religious
institutions through political avenues, is bad.  There, now it's defined.

Ahh. So kinda like how the AIM servers download all your contacts to
you whenever you install fresh.

Maybe try a different client? Like GAIM?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0405270701510.30932@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  A new problem with my HP Professional Color 2500C printer: the 11"x17"
paper feeds slightly skewed. I suspect that the feed rollers need a
cleaning. Has anyone any experience with this type of problem on a
large-format printer?

  I suppose that cleaning sheets are available at office supply stores.
Think it would work for me to run one through (from the back or manual feed
tray in the front), but on both sides so as to clean the rollers across the
width? I don't have any documentation that describes this problem.

TIA,

Rich

Colin,

  My postfix spam filters have been placing copies of this (at least, I
assume that's what it is) for a couple of weeks. I always go by the
guideline: if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.

A quick google search turned up the following results:

Based on that and other results I suggest staying away from this offer, it
appears to be not only SPAM but also a scam...

Hi,

This shows up in my mailbox at PCC about once a month and each time it's an 
"act now, call before..." offer.  Imagine the absolute minimum that meets 
these specs and it's an OK offer but not great.

Cheers,
Mike

That functionality is already in Jabber.  This would make it easier to
add a whole slew of contacts to your list that automatically updates
itself as other new members join or existing members leave....

I did... I've tried psi, GAIM, and tkabber.  It half-works with gaim
because gaim stores the contact list locally.  If everybody used gaim,
it *might* work, but I don't think it would continually update itself as
it should.

It's a bug in Jabber nobody seems to care about except for me.  After I
posted to the Jabber Admin list about the issues with the setup, I
received an off-list email from somebody stating *they* were shocked no
other IM services support said functionality, including Jabber, and that
it was one of the top requests they had for *their* servers, which
include IM functionality (and are adding this shared groups support in
the next release).

I've assembled four or five nforce2-based systems so far and haven't
encountered any problems with any of them... and I generally use the
third cheapest RAM available.  They're all running in dual-channel mode.

DOES reducing the memory bus frequency solve the problem?  DOES slowing
down the timings solve the problem?  You should be able to test either
of those through the BIOS, I think, with your current RAM.

I'm a huge nForce fan, myself... my old Duron 650 was able to outperform
most PIIIs of the 850-900MHz category in many benchmarks thanks to the
overabundance of memory bandwidth available to it.

I generally do the same.  Look at the html source to find out where
they've actually got the film, then make a quick wget to fetch it. 
Sometimes this means jumping through a couple hoops.
Then play it using mplayer.  I used to have it work via my browser, but
every so often I run into a problem with it.

  The linuxprinting.org Web site does not list the Oki 9200N color LED
printer at all. Does anyone know if this printer is supported under linux?
Any color LED printers?

Thanks,

  It is supported by EasySoftware's PrintPro; that's good 'cause I have a
copy of that. Now, has anyone used any of these led printers? I'm wondering
about the cost of supplies, output quality and local sources.

  My HP Professional Series 2500C has done very well, but it's comparatively
slow, _very_ expensive to operate[1] and takes a lot of room.

[1] Separate ink cartridges (at almost $40 each) and separate print heads
(about the same prices) for CYMK makes this an expensive printer to run.

Not only was the site accessed by humans, it was also accessed by the

I've been getting it too.  A good criteria if spamassassin is installed

"Platen cleaner" for typewriters should help.  Swab the rubber rollers a
couple times and a bunch of crud should come off.

If your livelihood depends on the printer, I'd recommend taking it in
to The Printer Place for a cleaning rather than doing it yourself.

Uses the PCL5c language, same as a Color LaserJet, which is well-
supported under Linux.

Never used the color LED printers, but Oki's B&W LED models are IMO some
of the best printers around.  Very crisp output, cheap consumables and
quite durable.

Wonder if there's a continuous-ink system for it?

using 802.11x. My main reason (other than security) for not wanting to use 802.11x is mostly that I
just don't want wireless signals running throw my house. I know, stupid, but I'd just rather not.
And I know there are products out there for phone line and power line ethernet connection sharing.
I'm wondering if anyone has had experience with these and what they thought of them?

Mel,
What I have done that works quite well, is to install the mplayerplug-in
v.2.6, which handles most Windows Media and Quicktime movies. For Real,
use the RealPlayer 10 alpha which just recently was released. 
https://player.helixcommunity.org/2004/downloads/ 
Select the RealPlayer Alpha not the HelixPlayer as that does not handle
RealMedia properly. By having both of these installed, I can watch Real,
Windows, and Quicktime as well as AVI, and MPEG. 
Because of the crappy way Yahoo Movies is set up, you seem forced to
have Windows Media Player as your only selection even with RealPlayer 10
installed. When I tried the Spiderman 2 trailer mplayerplug-in started,
and then it took about 5 minutes for the clip to load, only to have just
the sound work and not the video. This may be a problem with the .wmv
format. Not certain on that. It's the first time I've seen an issue
though. I've just watched 3 short films on atomfilms.com with the
RealPlayer 10 plugin and it worked great!

Enjoy,

In there are six of the stock phrases that are burned in the brain of
every sleazeball salesman when he emerges from the primordial ooze and
begins his instictive migration to the nearest car lot or discount
furniture store.

Four or five more stock phrases there.  Was this thing computer-
generated or something?

Oh, and the specs are for last year's bottom-of-the-line model.  You can
do better for $200 at Fry's or Wal-Mart.  Heck, you (or your friend) can
just about do better with a volunteer stint at FreeGeek.

Aaron,

  I noted that it does use PCL5; the linuxprinter.org site doesn't list that
model, however.

  I'm trying to find the cost of the consumables. Not that easy. May require
a call to Okidata. (I had an Oki dot-matrix printer that I sold to a former
associate. It's still working perfectly after 20 years with one replacement
print head. Great products.)

  A serious reservation, however, is weight: 72 kg! That's 159 pounds --
without the duplexer (which I don't need for color in any case). That is a
_very_ heavy printer for a SOHO.

> Wonder if there's a continuous-ink system for it?

  I doubt it. Ink cartridges have expiration dates (about 2 years) and the
printer refuses to run if a cartridge is expired. PITA! I don't know about
the print heads, but when replacing the expired black cartridge didn't print
the entire length of an 11"x17" page in portrait mode I bought a replacement
black print head. That solved that problem.

  The color printer is used only for producing maps that accompany reports
and permit applications. I just don't use it that frequently. But, when I
need it, the tabloid-size paper is exceptionally valuable for clarity of
presentation. And, some agencies require maps to be that size, too.

Thanks,

Rich

Aaron,

  Good idea. I know that alcohol will dry the rubber, but there is another
common liquid one can use. Lighter fluid? I don't recall.

  I keep it covered when not in use. But that's certainly an idea. The
printer is quite heavy and large; not at all fun to try to move.

I wouldn't trust "Avtech", but every so often Dell has a deal like
this that's surprisingly close and limited to educators. My father and
mother got a P4 Celeron *laptop* with slightly *better* specs than
this machine for around $300.

I wouldn't use Naptha (lighter fluid).  According to the MSDS, DEC
platen cleaner is a little over half Xylene, with some MEK.  Others use
chlorinated solvents.  I don't know of any common chemicals one could
use, maybe dry-cleaning fluid or spot remover?

Real or not, that looks like an average price for that level of hardware.
$699 is way too much for what's listed.

Have that, but still not working for me. Thought I might need a simlink
from /opt/mozilla/lib/plugins to /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins, but that
hasn't helped. (With Galeon at least.) I am running Suse 9.0 Personal
btw.

That's what MSRP is. (Manufactures Suggested Retail Price for those that 
don't know.)

Basically, that's what the manufacture thinks is the fair market value 
for the item you are purchasing. Most of the time, you will purchase 
stuff at much less than MSRP.

I've seen a lot of (Tom Petersen) retailers that advertise (Fry's) 
discounts from MSRP to make you (Damark) think you are getting a 
fantastic deal. Without checking it out, you may be paying more than the 
regular price, elsewhere.

Kudos to the guy that decided to check this out before jumping. :)

This figure [MSRP] is intended to make street prices

Mel,
Distro shouldn't be an issue. What I do is find one location for all
plugins, i.e. /usr/lib/mozilla (Fedora Core 2) and then simlink the
plugins directory in all other mozilla directories to that one. Mozilla
usually scans a number of directories to find plugins including
~/.mozilla/plugins, /opt/mozilla/plugins, /usr/lib/mozilla-X.X/plugins,
etc. but I find it easiest to locate all plugins in one directory then
simlink to it. Most non-ditro based RPMs tend to
use /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/ as the install location for their plugins.
Your solution maybe something like that.
As for realplayer, first uninstall the old RP:
rpm -e RealPlayer-8.0.3.465-10
then install the new:
rpm -Uvh RealPlayer-0.3.0.120-20040517.i586.rpm

This will install the plugin automagically
into /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins, btw.

The interface is much nicer and is GTK2. It handles media better than
RP8 as well. 

Good luck!

-Garrett

    I'm in the process in lining up and finalizing the speaker
schedule for the next few PLUG meetings (The first Thursday
meetings).  At this point I have:

    Jun 3, 2004  -     Chris Jantzen <chris at maybe.net>
                       He plans on discussing Bricolage 
                       (http://www.bricolage.cc/)
    Jul 1, 2004  -     Hal Pomeranz <hal at deer-run.com>
                       Topic is to be announced.
    Aug 5, 2004  -     Bradley Schrock <brad at schrocklaw.com>
                       A topic related to Open Source law.
    After that   -     Randal L. Schwartz <merlyn at stonehenge.com>
                       has talked about giving his presentation
                       on personal experience with the law.
                       David Mandel <dmandel at DavidMandel.com>
                       has been thinking about giving a presentation
                       on Open Source Software for MS Windows Users.
                       But nothing is scheduled at this point.

    Is anyone else interested in speaking or do you know of anyone
who should be asked to speak?  If so, please contact me either by
email or by calling me on my cell phone at 541-730-5285.

                                          Sincerely,

I don't want to start another flamewar about this, so I'll state my
opinion once and withdraw from the field:

Debian is free to call their Linux whatever they want. So is RedHat,
Yellow Dog, etc. However, Richard Stallman has *no* right to tell others
what to call their distro. There's nothing in the GNU license that says
"you're free to redistribute this software as long as you prepend 'GNU/'
to the name". If Stallman wants to insist on a name then maybe the FSF
ought to come up with it's own distro.

Truth be told, for years the GNU's Bulletin referred to the OS as simply
"Linux". This whole "you must call it GNU/Linux" thing is relatively new.

I won't hold my breath for that one. :)

That would, I suppose, be an ideal solution.  :-)

I guess I'll dig around the mod_groups code a little bit and see if I
see anything that makes sense.  I really have neither the time nor the
talent to do any significant programming, especially in c.  Jabberd is
an odd monstrosity of code... 

The lead jabberd developer seems, thus far, wholly uninterested in
mod_groups support at this stage of the game.

If you were watching PBS TV last Friday night (NOW with Bill Moyers),
you would know the truth about that misleading TV ad. Right after the
Vietnam war, when most of the country (Democrat and Republican) was
trying to reduce the size of the military, Kerry joined a great number
of Congressmen in voting against a large spending bill. One of the many
(MANY) items on the spending bill was body armor.

In short, characterizing a vote against an appropriations bill as a lack
of support for body armor is ridiculous and misleading.

I know it is too much to ask, but it pays to check your facts before
making allegations. Most everything you see in political ads (from
either side of the aisle) is misleading.

I think if you read closely, he is *asking* people to call it
GNU/Linux.  He might also be choosing to cooperate more with people
who do.  I don't see anything wrong with that.  Just plain "Linux"
really only accurately refers to the kernel.  The choice "GNU/Linux"
for the kernel plus the rest of the operating system is somewhat
arbitrary, just as any other choice is.  I personally try not to judge
other people for the name they give it.  The important thing is that
it exists and that it is Free Software.

Anyway, now we've got at least 4 cents.

ISO-9000 is a set of quality management standards. It is process-based,
not product-based. So, yes, ISO-9000 could be used for pizza production.

Hi,

I use Mandrake 9.1 with MPlayer and the mplayerplug-in with Mozilla. I
have all the codecs that are available for MPlayer and when I went to
movies.yahoo.com and chose the Spiderman2 movie trailer it played with
no problems.

Some of the streaming video requires java to be working within your
browser. Is that perhaps the problem with your setup? Do you have java
working in your browser? Otherwise I can only suggest that perhaps your
sound card was tied up with something else when you tried to play the
trailer -- which will cause mplayerplug-in to not play. (were you
listening to some mp3's at the time or something?).

Anyways -- the trailer does work under Linux. If you give more detail
perhaps I can help.

HTH

On Ebay you can often find Linux CD sets at attractive
prices. You can also find body armor at attractive
prices. Even if you are going to the Middle East,
perhaps you should have your own, because then it will
be yours to keep, and you might find that civilian

The thing is, what I run isn't just "GNU" and it isn't just "Linux". 
Calling it "GNU/Linux" isn't right either, because it's also software 
that gnu didn't develop and may have other licenses than the GPL.

For this reason, I tell them I run Mandrake. Period.

Or free and legal via BitTorrent.  I got my copies in less than a day 
via that method (and left it running until 2x the amount of data had 
been uploaded so that I don't freeload the BitTorrent system).

I'm not sure that the eBay versions are legal.  But IANAL.

: ISO-9000 is a set of quality management standards. It is process-based,
: not product-based. So, yes, ISO-9000 could be used for pizza production.

The funny thing about -9000, compared to -9001, -9002 or QS-9000 (automotive) 
is that ALL it really does is say 'write your quality plan down, and show 
inspectors that you are following your written plan.' There is NO requirement 
for process improvement (unless you write that in.)

I was at a 9000-certified stamping plant where the process boiled down to 
'stuff whatever crap that comes out of the final machine into boxes, and ship 
the closed boxes to customers.' No verifications on how accurately the 
machines were producing, (such as CPK.)

So, 'throw stuff on the dough, bake it and call it a pizza.'

Not in all cases. Documentation exists on both sides of WW-1 and -2 that 
snipers often sent home for their favorite scoped deer rifle to please be 
sent to the front, and these tools were warmly received by their brothers in 
arms on arrival.

I have also heard about Vietnam soldiers bringing a trusty farm-use 12-gauge 
with them for jungle use, but I cannot confirm that.

Nice lineup! In particular, I remember a talk some years ago at either
SANS or USENIX by Hal Pomeranz that was both very informative and
entertaining.

I also remember a karaoke performance of "Mack the Knife" by Randal
Schwartz that was...well...memorable...

Subject: [PLUG] Tracking down missing OS code author
Message-ID: <20040528165004.GA11542@gate.kl-ic.com>

This may be OT, but it relates to open source.  What happens to an
OS program when the author/website can no longer be found?

Many of you have seen my presentation on Dirvish for disk-to-disk
backups.  I had quite a correspondence going with Dirvish author
J.W. Schultz, with the last email from him dated March 1.  I received
no emails after March 1, which I chalked up to either busyness,
offendedness, lack of social skills, or "other" (after 50 years,
people still surprise me a lot, programmers especially).  In all
that email, I never learned his first name or what city he lives in.

Well, last night I learned that the Dirvish website
(http//www.pegasys.ws/dirvish) is no longer responding (it was up
a couple of months ago).   This led me to check with some of his
other correspondents, look for postings to the RSYNC mailing list,
Kernel mailing list, etc.  Apparently he dropped of the radar just
after March 1.

I know JW is older than I am, having discussed big-iron/punch-card
machines in his email (yes, I've used punch cards and paper tape).  
Further sleuthing revealed that his pegasys.ws website is registered
as a "dot website", and the .ws domain registrar (western samoa ?!)
does not reveal names, email addresses, etc.  The IP address is within
the xo.com subnet around the Bay area (thank you traceroute);  no news
articles or obituaroes for "Schultz", though.  Not that you are
required to reveal your real name on the internet.  There are, or
course, a zillion companies with Pegasys and Technologies in their
names.  There are also about 150 J. Schultzes listed in the Bay
area; and given his privacy habits, he may well be unlisted.

Can anyone suggest other means for finding a software guy?  Social
engineering techniques to apply to xo.com, the .ws registrar, SUSE
(his distro of choice), etc?  

If he is not findable, at what point do I set up a Dirvish website
of my own and start supporting it?  What is the etiquette here?

And for the rest of you O.S. authors, what are you doing about
continuity after you are unexpectedly called to a meeting with 
the Great Penguin In The Sky?

Arrest records?

Since his site went away some time after he disappeared, it might be 
intentional.  Or maybe he had a heart attack or something and his 
registration expired while he was in the hospital.  Maybe he found a 
bus with his name on it :-(

> If he is not findable, at what point do I set up a Dirvish website

I'd pop up a site relatively soon so that the search engines get it, 
but make sure that there are disclaimers that this is just a public 
service "for great software from the MIA author" and that you'll be 
redirecting to the original site once it is back.  That should make 
it clear to the author (if he is still around) that you are just 
trying to help rather than take over the project.  I'd collect 
patches and code.  I'd also put a plea for more information about the 
author on the site.  

If the author stays under the radar for more than a few months without 
showing up somewhere on a search engine, then I'd assume that he's 
either no longer capable of being on line or for some other reason 
has voluntarily dropped out.  Whatever the reason, you're it at that 
point.

Software that is orphaned without explanation rarely seems to come 
back without a supporter.  I cannot think of any examples.  I have 
seen sites that are mirrors of sites that dropped off the Internet 
for some reason.  Those sometimes grow into the main site for the 
software.

"Apres moi, le deluge" seems most common.

I would suspect that that is a mistake, since the use of most (all?)
shotgun ammo violates the Geneva convention, (full metal jacket).

Well they drilled it in to our heads in Marine Corps bootcamp in 1987,
though it was given very little attention thereafter. That being said,
only Military Police and Force Recon (USMC Special Forces) were issued
Combat Shotguns. They just were not a needed part of the Marine's basic
equipment load out. Nor during the (First) Gulf War were we ever allowed
to provide our own weapons, nor keep any we found on the battlefield. It
was an instant court martial in either case.

Message-ID: <40B7C54A.2090905@robinson-west.com>

I picked up some generic PC100 on ebay and it says low profile on it. 
 Does this simply mean that the DIMM is
short compared to other DIMMS?  I'm mixing it with Kingston ram and 
testing it now, hopefully memtest will
still be cranking away tomorrow.  I had one heck of a time getting it to 
detect.  I'm testing it on a VA503+ board,
these can support 512 megs can't they?  I figure with DIMMS that they 
can be mixed since they are fully
populated, unlike their simm predecessors.  Unlike Kingston memory on 
Ebay, the price of this generic
was actually reasonable.  I've seen an awful lot of this or that DIMM 
didn't work, isn't all PC100 ram
equal?  How about PC133 modules?

Subject: [PLUG] Gentoo running, filesystem and sound trouble...
Message-ID: <40B7CAAD.5030206@robinson-west.com>

I got a working gentoo system by not optimizing anything at all.

How do I fix the audio so that I can use it as a non root user?
I've tried supplementary group audio on my user account, but
that doesn't seem to work.  I get can't open /dev/dsp errors
with a normal user.  Is there a way to install the
installation guide and other docs, this is my first gentoo
system where I'm migrating from Redhat.

The filesystem trouble involves trying out Reiser.  I corrupted
it the first time I rebooted, but it repaired.  I think it didn't
umount properly.  What does the proper fstab entry look like
for a reiser partition?  I put portage on it's own reiser partition
when I realized that a 1.5 to 2 gig /usr is tight for a basic
system.

I have since tarred my portage partition and could change it to
ext3, but I'd like to keep it as reiser.

Can portage use an nfs mounted source code repository so that if
multiple systems run gentoo, the newest code from abroad only
has to be fetched once?

Hopefully this will work better on my laptop better than Redhat 9
does, so far so good.  I haven't tried getting Maple 9.02 for Linux
installed yet.  That might take installing Maple to Redhat 9 again,
tarring it up, and then moving the binaries over.  I don't think the
install script will recognize gentoo.

The problem with Redht 9 even on my desktop box has been
instability.  I think some of the libraries may be the wrong
versions, etc.  Seems that the 2.4 to 2.6 transition hasn't been
very clean.

Hello,
 
I recently downloaded a set of SuSE 9.0 diskimages from bittorrent.  SuSE Installs and runs nicely enough, but I want to make sure I've got the "real thing." (Particuarly before I leave the box up and running for more than 15 min at a time.)
 
Does anyone know where I might find a set of MD5 sums for the SuSE Pro 9.0 ISOs?  Is there anyone willing to create MD5 sums of their existing SuSE disks?  Perhaps I'm going about this in the wrong way?
 
A cursory google search did show a set of MD5 sums for SuSE 9.0 Pro disks, but they are on a russian site that I can't read.  THAT isn't all together comforting.
 
Thanks for your time and input,
Erik.

Well, WHAT ARE THE ERRORS?  If you are going to say you got errors, it
is best to also list out exactly WHAT the errors are, you know?  We
can't psychic.  ;-)

If they're permission errors, you need to fix the device nodes so your
users have permissions to play audio.  Are you using devfs?  udev?  just
regular devs?

Erm, SUSE 9.1?  Not 9.0?  I just deleted my ISO images of 9.0 :-(

I thought that bittorrent already had a check built into it.  I have 
retrieved bad ISOs via FTP and HTTP, but never via torrent yet.

It does, but it doesn't help if the person sharing the file in the
first place had a corrupt image.

It looks like the error was "can't open /dev/dsp", but I agree with
Rob.  Michael, it would help a lot if you formed your questions more
clearly, possibly by like this:

<preamble about the problem> I'm getting these errors:

$ <command>
<error output>
...

I believe I've pointed you to ESR's essay on asking good questions,
please take that seriously.  There's a bit for everyone in that doc,
and it is reasonably well written.

Regarding your permission problems.  Have you logged the user out and
back in so the group change takes affect? Have you checked the
permissions on /dev/dsp to ensure you are part of the correct group,
and that the permissions on the device haven't been fubar'd?

I wouldn't recommend switching back to ext3. Its performance is
significantly below reiserfs. Besides, you frequently run out of inodes
on an ext3 filesystem with Gentoo.

Frequently?  Although a long time ago I used to worry about such
things, I've never come close to running out of inodes.

Like I said, can't open /dev/dsp.  I added the audio group to my user 
account,
it works now.

I guess I needed to log out and then back in to X for the change to take 
affect. 
I have mail access on my laptop now, this will allow me to post future 
errors.

I'm attaching the kernel config for my running kernel.  I think I'm running
devfs, it's in there if I am.

I'll give the reiser tip a look, though I'm wondering if gentoo's init
scripts need specific lines added for shutdowns and halting?

What essay will tell me how to deal with the difficulties I've 
encountered on this
list lately?  No essay will lessen my disappointment in you for joining 
in on a
burn me thread.  For what it's worth though, thanks anyways for almost 
being
helpful.  Instead of "I believe I've pointed you," how about showing me 
again
or emailing me privately?

 As far as properly asking questions goes, there's no excuse for being 
unduly
harsh with someone who doesn't.

Yes Rogan, I have.  It wasn't working at first, but it does now.
As far as a preamble, everyone knows what /dev/dsp is.  I couldn't
post the actual error at the time because I wasn't emailing the list
from the machine it was happening on.  Yeah, I probably could
have done sneakernet.  Permission problems are obviously
common though.   Noone has to answer a  question here. 
Certainly it's okay to ask me for more information.

Aside: I would appreciate it if you, of all people, didn't use fubar 
because of what
           it stands for.  You may not believe in the importance of God 
after going
           through years of Catholic education, but I hope you will at 
least recognize
           the beauty of human sexuality.  Please refrain from the use 
of sexually
           derogatory terms in the future.  I've been through a lot of 
relationship pain
           lately that I won't go into here, I'm especially sensitive 
right now.

What docs are there on the permissions various gentoo programs are supposed
to have?  What's the best way to get this information?  In the rpm 
world, you'd
get it from the rpm.  With emerge, I don't know what to do.

Are you asking me to attach my kernel instead Rob?  The .config is the 
shortest
definitive reference I know of on how my kernel is configured.

Are you capable of anything other than harsh criticism when it comes to 
discouraging
the things you find rude?  It can get really irritating at times.

If the list administrator wants to set a maximum length for a single 
posting, he/she  is
welcome to do so.  It's not as if I'm purposely pushing a ton of 
information on people
to jam up their systems.  Not too long ago, I was using a modem myslef 
to go
online :-)

As far as message size, what is the maximum size that is reasonable
for everyone to take?  How can one check his/her size in mozilla, pine,
mailx, your favorite unlisted MUA?

Absolutely.  If you followed the advice in the essay, generally
speaking, you would find far less people consider you a troll or kook.

IMHO, nobody has been unduly harsh to you on this list.  As far as I'm
concerned, you've deserved every flame you've received, and you've
dished out as much crap as you've received.

Generally speaking, diagnosis of a problem is really sped up with the
exact error message happening.  It helps people google for you (I don't
think you really know how to google, anyway) and to grep their minds for
the thing.

Is your laptop not network connected?

And okay in what way is it for you to ask for more information?  (Whoa,
that sounded a bit Yoda-like)... AFAIK, it's as okay for you to ask
stupid questions as it is for me to blast you for it.  :-)

Your reasoning is fubar.  :-P

Hmmm?  What do you mean, what the permissions the programs are supposed
to have?  The question doesn't make sense to me.

Generally speaking, you can determine if anything has oddball
permissions by reading the ebuild; it's mostly just bash, anyway.

Absolutely not... we wouldn't know what to do with a kernel except boot
it.

Generally speaking, if you're going to attach something to an email
being sent to a mailing list, it is polite (to the list readers and
*especially* the list admins) to post a URL to the file instead of
attaching the file directly.

Capable?  Sure.  But do I find as much pleasure being polite to those I
consider rude versus being snide with them?  Absolutely not.  :-)

Depends on the context.  If it's an attached file, I'd say 2-3K is about
as big as you'd want to get.  If it's actual text... something that
isn't reasonable to put in your webspace, I'd say there isn't really so
much of a maximum.

What happened to your system date?  It's May.  May of 2004.  As much as
you'd apparently like to roll the clock back to 1325, you're not going to
do it by slowly decrementing your system time.

Think about it, Michael.  This isn't a technical problem and doesn't
require a technical answer.  Rob asked if you were running devfs or some
other automatic /dev filesystem.  You didn't have to include your entire
kernel config to show whether or not that was the case.  And you didn't
even include the simple answer.

This is very much like your failure to check google before asking the list
a question.  You sent the entire kernel config and said "the answer's in
there somewhere" with the implied "but I'm too lazy to pick it out for
myself."

grep -i dev /usr/src/linux/.config

Even THAT would give shorter output then the entire file.

The actual technological limit of message size isn't really important here
at all.  What's important is that you send as much information as is
appropriate for the investigation of the problem at hand -- no more, no
less.

Oh, and I was always taught that FUBAR stood for "Fouled Up Beyond All
Repair", so get your mind out of the fucking gutter.

Are you just incapable of refraining from posting this insane BS to the
list all the time? I know I have asked you nicely to knock it off as
have others but it seems like once a month or so you lose control and we
all have to suffer through your rants until you get your meds
straightened out or whatever it is that finally makes you quiet down.

might as well be using the correct distro...

Looks like a Slackware ripoff there.  IF you REALLY want to mix Religion
and Linux, Slackware is the way to go... all hail the mighty Bob of the

If anybody else on this list is receiving large batches of email

As likely the only person to have cause to respond to this request (which
should be clear from the headers of the messages he's already received),
you'd think he'd've checked his MTA.

So, if someone could please contact AthlonRob for me and tell him that I
would have gladly shared useful information about his problem had he not
been a willful ignoramous, that'd be great.

I chose my wording the way I did, and publicly, because you didn't
appear to learn enough to ask well fromed questions when I tried to
help you before.  The intent was to make you feel a little guilty for
ignoring, or at least not taking seriosly, what _was_ meant as a
friendly gesture.  I've read that essay and I learned a number of
things from it, it was not sent in jest originally, and it is not
sent that way now.

By preamble I meant "content other than that which is below".  For
example, a brief description of what you are trying to do -- sure we
could discern this from some error messages, but it's a courtesy.  It
is something that we appreciate, which is worth taking into
consideration when you ask for help.

Unless I miss my guess, the error you were getting was roughly one
line.  I believe you are a hypocrit.  In the message I am replying to,
you blame me for not looking up a url which I did not have handy and
claim that re-typing a short error that was currently being displayed
was enough effor to deter you from properly asking for donated
assistance.

 > Aside: I would appreciate it if you, of all people, didn't use

I'm not so different from everyone else.  I'll try not to use the
term in communication with you.  Will you try to ask clearer
questions?

Make me learn, is that it?  Friends don't talk to their friends this way. 
Who are you and what did you do with Rogan?  This plug list is more
like a sparring ring, follow the rules or else.  This is unacceptable. 
The gentoo list is a lot longer, maybe it's friendlier.  I tried to answer
someones question though and got harangued already.

That would have made the message longer.  Less impact on the list I 
figured was
better.  Unfortunately, it didn't matter.

You are in my book.  You may not think so, but there's a sensibility with
you that I hope you'll keep.  At the master's level, it doesn't hurt to
come off as professional.  You're smart enough, why not?  For a man
who's so far beyond me, have you lost your humility?  I refuse to be
like a man who agrees with Rob's mission to personally attack others.

Listen to yourself, I think you're stretching saying that there's 
something wrong
asking for help on the plug list first.  You could have discouraged Rob 
from doing
what he did, or are you aware?  This is a cold list in my opinion, I 
just hope that
spamming Rob in retaliation doesn't backfire on me.  I sent Rob and 
Brelin an
apology, but I'd say that Rob may very well be out of control.  I got
mobbed Rogan, you have to know that that's wrong.  Is there some reason you
agreed with Rob instead of asking that him and the others with him to 
stop their
attacks?  You know me, what do you honestly think I'm trying to do that 
you'd
look the other way when I'm being personally attacked?  Is this a tech 
list or a
mafia list?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0405290642560.8108@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I _think_ I'm at the last stages of getting the WiFi portion of the
network going here, but I need guidance on setting up
/etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts on the notebooks.

  First, the local WAP configuration: WPA+shared key is enabled and a string
of 30 random digits (hex format) entered as the key. Access control is also
enabled and the MAC addresses of the WiFi cards in the two portables are
entered here. SSID and channel are defined.

  The portables both run Slackware-9.1 and the cards light up when the
systems are booted (the tech at EmperorLinux found the bad section in their
net.agent script that hung that up on my notebook).

  On my notebook I have the 3Com 3CRWE154G72 card which uses the prism54
driver. I also copied /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts to wireless.opts.local and
wireless.opts.remote so I can use the machine both here and away from the
office. However, there is no example setup in the options file for this
card; there is one for a prismII card and there is a generic one that has
placeholders for all sorts of esoteric information about which I know

  For the .local version, should I have only the lines for SSID=, CHANNEL=,

  Update: in the local version I created filled variables. But, (and this is
the strange part) if I leave the default, original, unmodified wireless.opts
in place, when I run 'iwconfig eth1', the proper SSID, channel and WAP
HWaddress is picked up. But, when I try -- as a user, not root -- to ping
another host I see 'network is unreachable'.

  Then, to confuse me more, when I cp wireless.opts.local to wireless.opts,
bring down the eth1 interface, then bring it up again and run 'iwconfig
eth1', incorrect ESSID and channel are shown and there is no WAP HWaddress.

  I _must_ be getting closer but I cannot yet see the path to network access
(both literally and figuratively).

Suggestions?

One suggestion would be to go back to the access point,
disable the wep key and the use the default wireless.opts and
make sure that you get a connection that way. Then you can
go back and add the wep key if you feel so inclined..

  More update: on the second portable the Orinoco Gold card I bought during
the clinic also seems to light up but, ...

  1) There's no iwconfig on this system.
  2) When I try -- as a user -- to ping another host instead of immediately
seeing 'network is unreachable' it tries to ping but reports that the
destination host is unreachable.

  I believe I'm rather stuck here.

Bill,

  Excellent idea. If the WAP is set up with access control based on the
cards' MAC addresses, I wondered if a key is superfluous.

Bill,

  One down, one to go. The ThinkPad with the Orinoco Gold worked right away.
And, a test with mozilla was successful in accessing the 'Net. So, now I
need to fix her applications (mail's still not working and she lost printing
via mozilla and OO.o), and get my Vaio working wirelessly.

  Thanks for the pointer.

  Update III: Using the same, generic /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts as in the
ThinkPad I rebooted the Vaio. WiFi card lights up but the network is still
unreachable. 'iwconfig eth1' indicates the proper network, WAP MAC address
and channel.

  What should I check to test the routing? On the cat5 the connection works

I have found plugin directories under /usr/lib/mozilla, /opt/mozilla,
and my user directory ~/.mozilla/. I created symlinks from wherever the
actual file exists to the others. I believe that Suse wanted them in
~/.mozilla/plugins, as the mplayer plugin is working after I created the
symlink there.

Yes, I agree, at least as far as I have been able to use it. I have been
able to bring up airamericaradio.com. But, I am back to having the
RealPlayer selection grayed out when trying to view a movie trailer. It
does provide a link to Real for a download of the Windoze version (Plus
trial). There are lots of plugins in the appropriate directory, I
created several symlinks to ~.mozilla/plugins. But evidently have got
the right one(s) yet.

  I lost my routing table -- except for localhost. Worse, I cannot add a

Does iwconfig say anything?  I can have a look at my 802.11b box a 
little later if you want me to.
Forwarding must be enabled if cat five works.  Signal obstruction could 
pose a problem.
The ip command is a superset of route, I've had to use in cases where 
portsentry got overzealous.
The route command is limited in it's ability to modify the routing 
table, though it could be that
I just don't know enough about it.

I've honestly just skimmed this thread, so let me apologize if I'm
coming from Mars....

If you've set your default route and stuff over eth0, then you unplug
eth0 and enable your wifi connection, your default route is likely still
going to be over eth0, even if eth0 is down and your wifi connection has
eth0's IP address.

I'm not sure if you're trying to switch back and forth between wired and
wireless... if you are, just re-issue the route add default gw line
every time you switch to be sure it's set for the proper interface.

Rob

  Regardless of planet of origin, no apologies are necessary.

  The default route _used to be_ set over eth0. This morning I was trying to
get the WiFi connections working on both portables. My fiancee's ThinkPad is
working like a champ; my Sony Vaio is still not quite there. But, there was
no route to the network when I booted with only the WiFi card in.

  Tests included popping the WiFi card and plugging in the cat5, then
rebooting. Still no route to the network. Both 'route' and 'netstat -rn'
show only 127.0.0.0.

  No, I'm trying to get the wireless going and only switched to wired to see
what happened to my kernel routing table. I've no idea why it won't come
back when the notebook was working perfectly on the cable.

  Well, I've a bunch of shopping and errands to do. I'll get back to this
later today. One problem I face is that I'm an occasional SysAdmin so I keep
forgetting how to check for routes, set them back up again and so on. If I
did these things on a regular basis I'd have many fewer questions to ask.
But, that's not my job so I don't want to deal with these issues daily.

Thanks,

Rich

No. MAC Addresses can be trivially spoofed. You want a key eventually.

Subject: [PLUG] Mutt "Browser" Mode Display Formatting
Message-ID: <20040529202747.GA5397@nellump.net>

I can't exactly recall why, but sometime in the last month or so I
decided that my mailboxes should be converted from 'mbox' format to
'maildir' format. I used to rely on the file size displayed in mutt's
mailbox "browser" mode to gauge how many messages might be in any given
mailbox. With maildir mailboxes, though, I see only the 4-byte directory
size. Digging through the mutt docs and examples, it seems as if there's
no way for mutt to display how many new and current messages are hiding
in a maildir mailbox. This seems surprising. Is there something I'm
missing?

I watched a guy do it at a PLUG meeting several months ago.  He was
pissed off he didn't have pubnet access, so just spoofed an
authenticated MAC... kicking somebody else off in the process.

Not very nice...

Actually, someone contacted Rob and he removed me from his block list and

Um, I think plugging your ears and shaking your head whilst others try to
talk to you is childish behavior.  A block on a particular address is
analogous.

I don't know why I didn't just send him a message from a different
address, though.  He certainly doesn't have all of my domains blocked.

  Er, folks, ... you didn't go to that URL to understand the irony of the
comment. Here's a list of Why2k server tools that won awards. The award for
best firewall was given to OpenBSD. Seriously. Ergo, the ironic comment and
reason for posting the URL on the PLUG mail list in the first place.

A computer programmer, bored with his job, decided to start his own
business. Wanting to do something totally different from his current
occupation, he bought a mating pair of rheas and a large tract of land.

His rhea farm was soon doing a booming business as there appeared to be a
great demand for the birds. Not being satisfied with just selling the birds,
the rhea farmer started researching how the birds were being used. He found
that all parts of the birds were being used, except the feathers. Nobody
wanted the plainly colored rhea feathers.

The ex-programmer, now rhea farmer, purchased some equipment, technical
people, and chemicals, and was soon selling fancy, colored rhea feathers.
The resulting sales were amazing and made the new feather merchant very
happy. There was one small problem. The workers making the colored feathers
were becoming quite ill. The concerned young man called in a number of
doctors to determine the nature of the illness.

It was discovered that without exception, the workers had developed a severe
case of ... "dye a rhea".

In other words, it needs the following features:

1> Members should be able to read messages via email or the web interface.
2> Members should be able to post messages via email or the web interface.

Anyone know of any existing software that allows this?

I have a music share on a 2k3 server that I have been accessing via samba 
(version 3) for months now, yesterday  it quit working.  I can mount the 
share but dont see any files.  What makes this odd is this is a shared folder 
on the disk, I also have the whole disk mounted via a samba share and can see 
all the data on the disk accept the music folder is empty.

I did a disk check on the disk, removed the share, moved all my mp3s into a 
new folder on the disk (good excuse to finally get them organized), and made 
a new share.  Now when I mount the folder I can see all the files accept in 
one directory (I organized into genre folders), any ideas?  I am not showing 
anything in the logs on either the windows or linux machine.

Sure, enough.  /lib/modules/2.6.3/kernel/drivers/serial/serial_core.ko

I even got a message that /dev/ttyS0 and /dev/ttyS1 had interrupts

Reran XFree86 -configure and got actually mouse action.

If I remember correctly, the 2.6 kernel translates all mice to look like an 
IMPS2 mouse or something.  I just installed SuSE 9.1 and it all seems to 
work fine.  But, your existing X config might be fubar.

It's no different than using kill lists with newsreaders. It makes your

Why wouldn't you want to respect his obvious desire to not communicate with 
you? That's a spammer's attitude, that your message is more important
than his wish to not see it.

A person cannot know whether or not they want information until they are
presented with that information and can make a decision.  It's a flat
contradiction to say that you can know what you don't want to know.

Um, not quite.  Spam is unsolicited.  This guy was soliciting responses.

And I was right.  He was interested to read my response and removed the
block.

This is a personal issue.

WAP != "Wireless Access Point"

WAP = "Wireless Application Protocol"

WAP is used by cell phone to get to the web.  Acronym pollution has
effected my WAP class from time to time.

Zot,

  I didn't realize that acronyms were limited to a single definition. :-)

  Whether it's "pollution" or lack of specificity is probably dependent upon
one's perspective.

Subject: [PLUG] Errors in spamassassin
Message-ID: <1086046083.12278.46.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I run a script that calls 

        sa-learn --debug-level --showdots --spam --dir

I get a lot of these errors (like 143k FOR 1.6k spams):

Argument "\007905386M-Y^Kk@" isn't numeric in numeric lt (<) at
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm line
1245.

I have not tracked down the problem, but wondered if I am alone on this:

  1214 sub tok_put {
   1215   my ($self, $tok, $ts, $th, $atime) = @_;
   1216   $ts ||= 0;
   1217   $th ||= 0;
...
   1228   if ($ts == 0 && $th == 0) {
   1229     return if (!$exists_already); # If the token doesn't exist,
just ret        urn
   1230     $self->{db_toks}->{$NTOKENS_MAGIC_TOKEN}--;
   1231     delete $self->{db_toks}->{$tok};
   1232   } else {
   1233     if (!$exists_already) { # If the token doesn't exist, raise
the toke        n count
   1234       $self->{db_toks}->{$NTOKENS_MAGIC_TOKEN}++;
   1235     }
   1236 
   1237     $self->{db_toks}->{$tok} = $self->tok_pack ($ts, $th,
$atime);
   1238 
   1239     my $newmagic =
$self->{db_toks}->{$NEWEST_TOKEN_AGE_MAGIC_TOKEN};
   1240     if (!defined ($newmagic) || $atime > $newmagic) {
   1241       $self->{db_toks}->{$NEWEST_TOKEN_AGE_MAGIC_TOKEN} =
$atime;
   1242     }
   1243 
   1244     my $oldmagic =
$self->{db_toks}->{$OLDEST_TOKEN_AGE_MAGIC_TOKEN};
   1245     if (!defined ($oldmagic) || $atime < $oldmagic) {
   1246       $self->{db_toks}->{$OLDEST_TOKEN_AGE_MAGIC_TOKEN} =
$atime;
   1247     }
   1248   }
   1249 }

This month's scheduled speaker has a family emergency and 
had to cancel at the last minute.  Thus, we need a speaker.

Would anyone like to fill in?

If not, I will come up with something, but it will definitely
be last minute as I'm not working on any Open Source projects 
at the moment.  At least, I'm not far enough along to speak
on my work.

                                          Sincerely,

Subject: [PLUG] dspam vs spamassassin
Message-ID: <40BC023D.6060200@dimstar.net>

I've been reading about dspam.

It looks like a good alternative to spamassassin. It also has some 
features that I like, such as tracking, and graphing.

Has anyone here used dspam? Positives? Negatives?
