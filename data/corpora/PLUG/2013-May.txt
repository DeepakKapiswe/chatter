Subject: [PLUG] Unicode mystery
Message-ID: <20130501080226.6e464a13@Devil8>

As I read my mail this morning there are a couple posts to Plug-Talk by
Russell regarding FCC chairs. The text was interesting, but to me what
was even more curious was a mystery glyph in the subject line: "?."
From the context the glyph was intended to by an apostrophe. This glyph
did not render in Claws Mail. I copied and pasted it into a LO Writer
document, where it also failed to render, and ditto for Gedit. Looking
at the headers for the mail I find "User-Agent: Gnus/5.101 (Gnus
v5.10.10) Emacs/21.4 (gnu/linux)."

I can go to websites written in Thai, Devanagari, Chinese, Arabic, or
any other of the hundreds of writing systems in the world, and they all
render flawlessly in Firefox on any Linux computer that I have ever
tried. Similarly, when I occasionally receive an e-mail written in a
non-Roman script, it renders fine in Claws Mail. However, I must confess
that I am ignorant of the magic behind the display. These things have
always just worked without intervention by me.

I noticed that the glyph appears in Claws Mail and Gedit as a box with
numbers in it, specifically:

00
92

Assuming that this is the Unicode value, I used Fontforge to look up
what U+0092 is supposed to be, and it turns out to be "C1 Control
Character." Googling on what a C1 Control Character might be turned up
a Wikipedia page where U+0092 is defined as "Private Use 2: Reserved for
a function without standardized meaning for private use as required,
subject to the prior agreement of the sender and the recipient of the
data." WTH?

And having got this far I remember that occasionally text on an
otherwise English web site or e-mail has a glyph that does not render
properly. From past experience the apostrophe seems to be a common
culprit. So now I'm curious about what program(s) are producing
this unusual glyph instead of the intended apostrophe, and why. (I find
"Emacs" in the header above.)  It might be useful to know not to use
such program(s) when writing text for web pages. 

So I started my Wednesday morning with a bit of education. But I bet
there's more to the story. :)

That looks like a Windows CP1252 apostrophe.
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252

The document is not UTF-8, regardless of what the header
says.

John,

   I see a lot of these types of glyphs in messages written with a Microsoft
tool in a GUI mail user agent but read by me with alpine (a text-based MUA).
I don't know that they're unicode and have always assumed they're some funky
HTML code. For the most part I ignore them.

   When they show up in a message that I forward I delete the cruft and
replace it with the appropriate punctuation and that resolves the issue.

I use a lot more than ordinary keyboard characters in my emails,
with vim-enabled constructs like CO? and E = ?mv? .

How many of you can read those?  While I don't use M$ crap, I
do see a lot of funny text out there.  I have a few Asian
friends and clients, so I see a /lot/ of text that doesn't
render well in UTF-8 on the ASCII text window I use for email.
And some surprising stuff that does - one Israeli correspondent
sends emails with headers and diclaimers that render in Hebrew.

So, think of <92> as a warning - the sender probably runs M$,
their machine is probably p0wned, and their attachments will
p0wn other M$ machines.  Fix them before you forward them.

Looks like carbon dioxide, and E equated with one half of m v squared on 
Thunderbird on Ubuntu 12.04.

No problem here: Carbon dioxide and E equals one-half m v-squared when
using both Claws Mail and the nmh show command.  However, the latter
depends on the terminal program (and the font it uses?).  Roxterm,
urxvt, and Terminology work.  The VTs (<alt><ctrl>1, etc) can't
display the subscripted two of carbon dioxide or the "?" that John
was talking about -- they just show a small box.  (The VTs have a
limited character set; they don't speak Unicode.)  Interestingly,
urxvt can't display the box glyph (it doesn't show anything), though
Roxterm does.  Terminology doesn't display the box glyph either.  It
displays what looks like a small, mid-line apostrophe.  Just to gild
the lily, emacs, with which I'm writing this message, displays "?"
as "\222": octal 222.

I'm sure John's correspondent's machine runs M$, but that says nothing
about its state of viral p0wnage.  As Jim Garrison mentioned earlier,
John's correspondent's software is probably using the Windows 1252
code page.  Unfortunately, some people seem to think that's Unicode.

Agreed.  I'm always amazed at Mutt's ability to faithfully display Russian,
Chinese and Korean spam.

ditto Thunderbird/Ubuntu (12.04 and 10.04)

Surprisingly it's also readable in MS Outlook for Mac 2011 (v.14.3.2) on
OSX 10.7.4 (imap connection to Gmail)

+1, also in Alpine. (Honestly, I think Rich and I are now a

Hi Rich,

While I have yet to try org-mode, it does look interesting.  If no one
answers here, you might try asking questions on IRC in the #emacs
channel of irc.freenode.net.  There are several people there who use
org mode.  (Contrariwise, there are some there who loathe it.  Ye pays
yer money an' takes yer chances.)  Also, the Emacs Wiki web page

    <http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/OrgMode>

has some information, and pointers to lots more.

Hope this helps.

Dale,

   I planned on looking at the wiki and thought that personal experiences
from folks here would also be helpful.

Thanks,

Hi Rich,

I use org-mode daily for task management (and have for nearly three years
now), but that's where I draw the line.

It has some very sophisticated features, such as tables, scheduling,
calendar integration, agendas, export to rich document formats (eg: wiki
markup, LaTeX documents, Beamer presentations, etc...)  However, when I've
used it for those purposes in the past, three critical problems have come
up:

 - Only other users with a very similar org-mode and emacs configurations
can build the final documents.  I've spent hours trying to figure out why
emacs couldn't generate a pdf from an org file that worked fine on a
different machine, to discover it was a /minor/ version difference in
org-mode versions.

 - building documents, exporting to different formats, or doing any other
document manipulation that utilizes the org-mode structure has to be done
interactively.  This is not a major issue for small documents, but as files
grow, and you need to incorporate progressively more complex features (such
as using bibtex, image conversions from formats such as svg to raster,
and/or performing other build-time tasks -- evaluating source code to
ensure accuracy, perhaps?) you'll run into trouble automating the build.
 This gets worse when you need to go back and build an old document, and
you can't remember the 7-step process to get a result out, or when you go
on vacation and someone else needs to do the same.

 - /once in a while/ the parser will become confused, and it's not always
obvious when that has happened.  I've lost significant content because I
inadvertently typed "..." in the wrong place, and org conflated a top-level
section.  *If you notice* you can switch to fundamental mode and fix the
syntax issues, but if you don't notice, you can end up deleting/moving more
than you expect.  This can range from merely annoying, to disastrous.

That said, I find it's very hand as a TODO manager, and many people do
swear by it, but I strongly caution anyone considering its use for complex
/ multi-person documents.

Rogan,

   Thanks very much for the feedback. I am renewing my marketing program and
wondered if org-mode would be suitable; that is, keeping tasks and notes on
results all in one place rather than in several. From what you write I think
it can do the job for me.

   Since this is a major re-write for me I'm not yet sure of all the
components I want to prepare and track.

Much appreciated,

Rich

Hi All,

Just as a counter-example to the "will take anything" assertion...

FreeGeek declined when I asked about their willingness to recycle the
SkyPilots we got from the defunct MetroFi network.  The ones we have
recycled have been dismantled by PTP volunteers.  The upside is we've
made several hundred dollars on aluminum scrap.  We've also recovered
and reused various components.  I'm told (by a guy at FarWestFiber)
that the circuit boards are worth ~$1/lb, primarily for the rare-earth
elements in the capacitors.  The polycarbonate GE Lexan is not worth
money as scrap, but FarWest was taking it until recently in their
rigid plastics bin.

That said, I think you are pretty safe with FreeGeek for the burnt
servers.

ok, fair enough. _I_ will take anything, and if free geek doesn't want it,
I volunteer to figure out what to do with it.

it may depend on who you get working in receiving that day. I have had some
variability in attitude, but I've never been flatly refused. there were
some things I chose not to give them because of what they would do with
them, but that was my choice rather than theirs.

Goodwill will also take electronics for recycling, if you get to Free 
Geek on a day when the receiving help doesn't want them.

   I have an old, spring-operated radio that I want to recycle. Will Free
Geek accept it and appropriately canabalize it?

And old Freeplay?  Cool!  Accept it?  Yes.  Appropriately cannibalize it?
If it works, it'll go to the store.  If not, it will be scrapped.

If it's bustid, I'm sure there are DorkBotters who could find a use for
that nifty clock-spring generator.  Heck, the survival store on Glisan
might even want it.

I use scribus. You import the PDF as a graphic, then add text as needed, or
whatever you need to change. Then export as a new PDF.

This is of interest to me, too ... I have Scribus 1.4.0 running on 
Mageia 2, KDE4, but I cannot import a pdf, and opening a pdf is less 
than satisfactory.

Any hints would be appreciated

In the meantime, I searched Scribus help on "import pdf" and basically 
they suggested a number of other packages for editing pdf's including 
this snip:
"


  * If you want to edit a PDF that comprises artwork, you can use GIMP
    <toolbox4.html>, Krita <toolbox15.html>, Inkscape <toolbox9.html> or
    Libre Office Draw <toolbox18.html>, depending on the content, as all
    of them can import PDFs and will let you edit the files.

"

So I tested that suggestion with GIMP (2.8) and that works pretty well, 
I think.

Thank you
Regards
Fred James

PS: I used to use xJournal on GNOME with some success.

If you are talking about a text PDF, you can also use
LibreOffice/OpenOffice Writer, it has import/export PDF.

Also when you say "edit", are you referring to editing an existing document
(which can be tricky to change text depending on the settings of the
original PDF), or creating a new one?

Well, feel free to donate it to FreeGeek, it might make it to the store
anyway.  But I would not mind trying to find a new antenna for it, or
failing that, making something out of it for my earthquake kit.

Aaron,

   I suppose a limp wire or a coat hanger will serve as an antenna. Should I
put your name on it when I bring it to Free Geek?

I don't usually hang out there, so I guess you can just tell them that if
it winds up in the store, there's at least one person who would buy it. :)

The Cadillac program for editing PDFs is Adobe Acrobat. However, I
refuse to pay the money for it, although as a graduate student at PSU I
can use the graduate computer labs where the computers have it
installed. I still don't use it because I can find open source
solutions that have been adequate for my needs so far.

If you have a problem with Scribus be sure you have the latest (1.4.2)
and when you import the PDF create a graphic frame first and import the
PDF into the graphic frame. This is still a kludge, however, as Scribus
cannot actually edit the PDF file. You can use Scribus to place white
boxes over things to "erase" them, and then more text boxes on top of
that to add text, or even graphics frames to add graphics on top of the
PDF. 

As others have noted, LibreOffice can import a text PDF and edit it,
although not as well as you might think. The problem is that when a PDF
is created the text is segmented into chunks that no longer flow like
text in a normal text editor. Forget about line wrap and paragraphs. 

When faced with the need to edit a PDF I usually find it more effective
to copy the elements out of the original PDF and paste them into a new
document in Scribus or LibreOffice Writer, adjust and edit the text as
desired, and export as a new PDF. This works well as long as the text in
the original PDF is still text and has not been converted to paths, and
the graphics are not locked.

In the unlikely event that Free Geek won't take them, three other 
places in southwest that recycle computers/electronics:

1) ecoBinary at Nimbus and Hall, near 217.
2) Green Century off Macadam in SW Portland
3) Far West Fibers near 217 and Denny in Beaverton

Depending on how burned these servers are, there may be some

Requests for www.* are served as I expect, the page(s) for the .net and .org sites are delivered.

However requests for the ServerAliases, new.example.org and testy.example.net, are fufilled from default.example.com

This is on Apache 2.2.22 A similar config is working as expected on an Apache 2.2.8 installation.

PDF is not really a word processor format, more of a final output
format for screen and printers.  Adobe has their pricey editor but
reversed engineered software is going to be hard to find. Essentially,
when creating PDFs, you always work from a non-pdf source (word
processor, etc) and export to pdf the final copy - analogous to
printing - so that who ever you give the pdf to can view/print on
anything device withour needing your particular software. If someone
gives you a pdf, and you need to edit it, you should really ask for
the original source file.

On Linux it is easy enough to view, print, annotate, but the solutions
(Libreoffice/Openoffice, Scribus, etc) are not going to work very well
in most cases, especially not if there is any pdf security set.  xpdf
has some tools to convert (see you repo and
http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/home.html )  You might also try:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDFedit  <- This might be nice.
http://pdftohtml.sourceforge.net/
http://www.pstoedit.net/pstoedit/

That said, GIMP and Libreoffice 4 can work, but after import you
should first save as a native format and edit that, then, once done,
export to pdf.  I find Libreoffice Draw a bit easier to use for this
than GIMP.

"xournal" is my go-to choice for tweaking PDFs.  It's nominally a pen-based
note taking app, but works fine for making minor to moderate modifications
of PDFs.  As others have noted, it's very difficult to actually /change/
the content of a pdf (eg: tweaking existing words in the original font,
removing graphics, etc...) but you can over-lay content to achieve a
similar effect.

I'm by no means an apache expert,  but my configuration (arrived
at by trial and error, years of accumulation, for a huge number
of URLs) is far more complex than that.  Among other things, each
Virtualhost stanza has a DocumentRoot or some other handler in it. 
Not sure how your config finds the content it serves.  I assume
you left the handlers out of the above for simplicity.

I would experiment with changing the ServerAliases to separate
stanzas with experimental handlers on them.  And set LogLevel
to "biblical flood".  

It probably isn't necessary, but I use the specific dotquad IP
address in NameVirtualHost instead of the wildcard *.  But then,
I use an http port on one of my IP addresses to sneak VPN traffic
past aggressive institutional firewalls.

I did. 

I also retyped the relevant bits.  What should have been there was:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
            ServerName    www.example.net
            ServerAlias   testy.example.net. morehost.example.net
    </VirtualHost>

While a trailing dot is used in Bind configs to root a FQDN, this is breakage in Apache config.
Worse, using `apache2 -S` or `apachectl -S` to syntax check your configuration yields a "Syntax OK" message.

So removing the trailing dot on testy.example.net resolved the problem.

I think somewhere on this thread someone asked if ethernet can work over USB.

I just tried a quick test of a Soundstream model 
ss1001 USB to Ethernet device. It let me load web 
pages, so I guess it works OK. Ubuntu on an acer 
Aspire netbook. The device is about 2" long and 
3/4" square cross section box with a Ethernet 
jack on one end and a USB cable coming out the other end.

PS: I successfully installed Ubuntu to a 16G 
thumb drive (but couldn't get a 32G to work something about the formatting.)

Thanks

I don't know if they sell laptop stands or docks, but Think Penguin (in
addition to Zareason) is a good place to buy computers from.

good Luck,

Thanks for the heads up. I had not heard of Think Penguin before. Sadly,
they offer only low end laptops. What I want will probably set me back a
couple thousand simoleons. 

At the top of my list at the moment is the Traverse Pro from Puget
Computers in Seattle. It has everything I want except the docking
station. But I can use a USB 3.0 docking station with it, and its USB
3.0 ports are at the very back of the sides. Its competition is a high
end Thinkpad 530. The Thinkpad offers a perfect docking station, but no
blue-ray burner.

I have decided to defer the decision until school is out a month from
now. The DVD burner in my T61 doesn't work and one of the two DVD
drives in my desktop has also died. I'm down to one working DVD burner
in the house. But I can limp along for another month.

Subject: [PLUG] LibreOffice spreadsheet question...
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1305110935060.2347@grond.sourballs.org>

I don't use spreadsheets very often, so my cell-formula-fu is quite 
limited.  I'm trying to come up with a way of having a cell (let's call it 
'A1') contain the value of another cell.  That other cell will be the last 
occupied column of row 1, and it will vary over time.  So sometimes I want 
A1 to contain the value of E1, because that's the last occupied column; 
but other times it should contain the value of W1, because that is the 
last occupied column.  I rummaged through the Help, but didn't see 
anything that obviously solved my problem.

Can this be done?

If so, can someone explain how?

Thanks in advance.

There's several ways to tackle this one. The easiest (but a little 
inelegant) would be to use a named range for the column or a named range 
in the cell one beyond the end. Then every time you insert a new row 
into your active data area, you would automatically expand the range or 
bump t6he marker cell down a row.

Another solution (I haven't tested this myself yet, but it looks right) 
from the Minor Point blog offers a formula solution good for both calc 
and excel. You can read about it here:
http://minorpoint.blogspot.com/2010/09/how-to-find-last-used-row-in.html

Hope that does the trick for you!|

INDEX(A1:Z1,1,COUNTA(A1:Z1),1)

where it is assumed that the Z1 is as far in the row as your data could be.
 Otherwise change Z1 to whatever you want.  Also, this assumes that there
will be no blanks in the columns to the left of the last.

I am trying to follow the solution in your first paragraph ...

The second paragraph solution, and others I have seen so far, only count 
the number of rows, or with a little modification the number of columns.

But the original question was (I believe) to place the value found in 
the last non-blank cell of a row, into the first cell of the same row?  
As I understand it (and I may be wrong), that would be something like ...

Row 1 has values in
     B=2
     C=40
     D=1
so we want cell A1 to contain the number 1, which is the value in cell D1

Row 1 changes and has values in
     B=2
     C=40
     D=1
     E=75
so we want cell A1 to contain the number 75, which is the value in cell E1

Row 1 changes again and has values in
     B=2
     C=40
     D=15
so we want cell A1 to contain the number 15, which is the new value in 
cell D1

Could you please, clarify your first paragraph solution, perhaps with an 
example?
Thank you
Regards
Fred James

What behavior do you want in this case:

 B=2
 C=40
 D=<blank>
 E=14
 F=80

The potential presence of blanks is what makes this a bit more complicated.

Back to the original poster and that question ... I am guessing that 
there wasn't supposed to be any blanks such as in your example.  But one 
would have to ask the original poster to be sure.

Did you precede INDEX... with an equal sign?  Otherwise I do not know what
could be causing the problem.  You might place =COUNTA(A1:Z1) in another
cell to see if that returns the expected value.  Then try
=INDEX(A1:Z1,1,<that expected value>) to see what you get.  Note that the
last "1" in INDEX(A1:Z1,1,COUNTA(A1:Z1),1) is optional, and can be dropped.

If you need to have blanks in the row but still want the last entry you
might be able to start at the end of the row and count blanks, but I am not
sure how to do that.

Arrg, @#%! I messed up.

The syntax for index()  should be INDEX( range, row, column, area ) In 
my original response I had row and column transposed. Also, I'm using 
excel here because that's what I have installed on a 17 yr old Dell 
Inspiron 5000. Anyway in Calc the parameter delimiter is a semi-colon, 
but it's a comma in Excel. SOooo... the two functions work in tandem; 
COUNTA() counts the number of items in the range, and it uses that value 
to tell INDEX what row number is last. If you read the documentation 
(and you should) you will see COUNTA() skips  blank cells that might be 
in the range/list. You'll save yourself a lot of effort if you adopt a 
non-null "no data" indicator instead of leaving empty cells in your 
data. I'd recommend using one single-quote in cells with no data.

Here's an example of these two functions in action. Suppose we have a 
list of colors in C3:C9 like so:
   |___A ___|___B___|___C________|
1 | indigo     7
2|
3|               infra-red
4 |red
5|orange
6|yellow
7|green
8|blue
9|indigo

Cell B1 contains the function COUNTA(), and the parameter is the range 
of colors, "C3:C9". Cell A1 contains the INDEX function which calls 
COUNTA function, and looks like this:

    INDEX(C3:C9, COUNTA(C3:C9), 1, 1 )

This returns the value of the cell in the list at row 7, column 1, and 
since we're only returning one column, the area is 1. I'm going to add a 
couple of conveniences before we push, but that's a description  of the 
naked functions.

To make this more readable, were going to use a name to refer to the 
range, now. So we add a column name above the first row of data. and 
name the column "colors". Do the usual Calc / Excel naming ceremony to 
add a named reference tothe whole column and we can now reference the 
column range with its name, 'colors.'

   |___A ___|___B___|___C________|____D____|
1 | indigo
2|                   *colors*    *wavelength*
3|               infra-red     '
4 |red           750
5|orange        620
6|yellow        590
7|green         570
8|blue          495
9|               violet       450


And change the formula in A1 to:  INDEX( colors, COUNTA(colors), 1, 1 )
Now we can can add additional columns, such as wavelengths (nm) of the 
associated color. THis is a table and you can use functions like LOOKUP, 
HLOOKUP, MATCH and many others to read and write its cells. Google 
searches are helpful if you don't know what an operation is called, like 
"curve fitting" or "table functions".

Hopefully this will hepl you make sense of the Calc functions, and I 
suspect you may be revising your model, but I didn't really follow what 
you were trying to do. If you still want an explanation using that 
construct, then I'm going to need an example, I think.

In Row1 Column A, enter ...

         press <Ctrl-Shift-Enter> ... this adds {}'s and makes it an array

In Row1 Column B, enter ...

Copy this to Column B for each row in use (the row number should

Enter data in rows, in columns C to Z ... blanks are allowed.

Column B of each row will contain the value displayed in the last column 
of that row that contains data.

Key items:
     blank cells are allowed
     numeric and character data are allowed
     data in columns AA and beyond will cause errors
         might be able to work around that, but have not tried at this point

Note:  I tried combining the formulas in columns a and b, and I got 
formula overflow errors.

I would be interested if anyone finds an error or problem, or has any 
comments or suggestions ... thank you.

I shouldn't make sweeping statement when I haven't double checked the 
facts. I didn't have a copy of Calc to try things yesterday. My 
reference was a memory like a sieve and software superstitions (y'know, 
that 's the little irrational things you believe or do with software 
you've used for a long time and still  have little habits that you 
thought were necessary when first learning, but aren't?)  I think  
you're right about the commas. Commas and semi-colons do appear to work 
the same way in calc and excel. Commas delimit array elements, 
semi-colons delimit ranges (i.e. the multi-range A1:B2;C1:C5 references 
two separate areas but both are selected)

Subject: [PLUG] need help with Apache HTTP_REFERER
Message-ID: <70086D201BD484439914C36F5C8BF16101ACA12ED272@EMAIL04.pnl.gov>

Hi

I need to configure my Apache web server to redirect an incoming request if it?s not from a specific web site.  I?ve been trying unsuccessfully to use the HTTP_REFERER to do this.   Most of the discussion I?ve found about this involves the prevention of hotlinking.  My webserver a RHEL5 box running RHEL5 Apache 2.2.3.

This is what I want to do:
        Request from www.foo.com<http://www.foo.com> goes to the web site.
        Request from anyone else gets an html page that essentially says you have to be registered to access the web site.

Here is the original VirtualHost definition:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule   ^/$  /training/who/cgi-bin/login [R]

    ServerName example.org

    DocumentRoot /apps/example/training/www/Root/who

    ScriptAlias /training/who/cgi-bin/ "/apps/example/training/www/Root/who/cgi-bin/"
    ScriptAlias /training/cgi-bin/     "/apps/example/training/www/Root/who/cgi-bin/"
    Alias       /training              "/apps/example/training/www/Root"
    <Directory "/apps/example/training/www/">
       AllowOverride All
       Options +FollowSymlinks +Indexes
       Order allow,deny
       Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>


Here is one example of the syntax I?ve tried. This displays the Apache default web page.  The error message in the log file is Directory index forbidden by Options directive.
<VirtualHost *:80>
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.foo.com [NC]
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.org/training/who/redirect.html [L]

    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} http://www.foo.com [NC]
    RewriteRule   ^/$  /training/who/cgi-bin/login [R]



This next syntax results in getting to the application login page instead of getting the redirect.html page displayed.

<VirtualHost *:80>
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} .
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !.*www.foo.com [NC]
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.org/training/who/redirect.html

    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} .
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} http://www.foo.com [NC]
    RewriteRule   ^/$  /training/who/cgi-bin/login [R]


This also skips the redirect, and goes to the login page, without graphics:



<VirtualHost *:80>

    RewriteEngine on



    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$

    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www\.foo\.com/.*$ [NC]

    RewriteRule \.*$ http://example.org/training/who/redirect.html [R=301,L]



    RewriteRule   ^/$  /training/who/cgi-bin/login [R]



Any help is appreciated.

Thank you.

Blu-ray came out too late as an optical disk format.  It didn't really
catch on.  Unless you have a specific need to use  a Blu-ray burner, I
wouldn't bother with it.

Glad to hear you checked out Think Penguin.  I recently learned about them,
& they sound like a good shop.  They use hardware that's libre software
friendly.  Also, they're flexible about what distro they provide, unlike
System 76.

Cheers,

Elcaset

Marvin,

Why don't you put it back to the original configuration.  Boot the 
system.  Then move the diretories under home to home2.  Create links 
from /home to the /home2 directories.

original:
/home/user1
/home/user2
. . .
New:

ls -hal /home
lrwxrwxrwx user1 user1 12 May 13 9:14 user1->/home2/user1
lrwxrwxrwx user2 user2 12 May 13 9:15 user2->/home2/user2

Easy as pie.

Ken

Good answer..

Yes. I know this problem. It has been a very long time since I have looked
in this space, but it is related to having all the files in the right
place, at the right  time so that the login process can get to what it
needs to get to, with the right permissions.

Debugging what particular piece of that is out of alignment is well worth
the effort and much better than the link solution, which will work for the
short term and create a huge mess at the end of the day.

Try blkid on the partition you are trying to mount and make sure the
UUID matches what /etc/fstab is expecting.  Also, in case of login
troubles, try logging in as root (root's HOMEDIR doesn't live in
/home) and looking at dmesg output to see if it'll give you clues as
to why.

Hi All,

This is my first post to the list.


> This is going to painfull in the long run.

You may try:

# mv /home /home_old
# ln -s /home2 /home

This is generally a painless solution, that I use when I am stuck with disk
space.

I hope, after that you may be able to login.

Subject: [PLUG] Strangely frozen desktop
Message-ID: <20130517202553.6cb95024@Devil8>

I have a desktop computer that streams internet radio all day for me
(Xubuntu 12.04 x86_64, freshly installed several months ago).
Just now I decided to shut off the radio and watch a movie with VLC.
However, while the mouse moves around, it will not click. And I notice
that the clock says 2:47 PM, when it is really 7:57 pm. The keyboard is
also not operational. But the weird thing is that the radio continues to
play. I assume that means that it is just X that has locked up. 

This is about the third time that this has happened. As I recall, last
time there were no messages in /var/log/messages or in Xorg messages.
However, this time I know it happened at 2:47 pm, not that that
information is much help.

Without a keyboard or a mouse I'm going to have to reboot. This is
annoying. The video is just GeForce 6150, pretty vanilla, and I'm using
just the default nouveau driver; never installed anything else. I'm
wondering if it's time to bid Ubuntu goodbye and go to something else
that has an xfce flavor. I'm tired of constant updates and breakages
that I can't diagnose. Any suggestions?

The proprietary Nvidia drivers work well enough.

Does the computer have an SSH daemon running?  If so, you could log in
remotely and restart the session manager, which should effectively
restart X.  I don't recall what session manager Ubuntu uses.  If it's
Gnome's display manager, the command would be "service gdm3 restart".
Replace "gdm3" with whatever your system uses.

I don't know what an SSH daemon is, so my bet is that there is not one
running. Not unless it was installed with a default Xubuntu
installation. Also, Gnome is not installed, except for those parts

I once installed the nVidia drivers on a Fedora computer and later
uninstalled them. Afterward nouveau drivers would not work because the
nVidia drivers had hopelessly garbled a bunch of links. After hours of
googling I finally got the nouveau drivers back, but never did get the
nice Fedora teardrop splash screen back. 

If I ever have to install the proprietary nVidia drivers to get a
computer to work, I'll get a different computer.

Look for one with an Intel Video chipset. Those should work nicely.

$ pidof sshd

if you get a bunch of numbers, you have an ssh daemon running.  If you
just get another shell prompt, then you don't.

Subject: [PLUG] "Gave up waiting for root device."
Message-ID: <5197F55F.5050305@comcast.net>

I installed 12.04 on a Dell Dimension 2400 that has a PCI card driving a 
SATA hard drive. When I boot I get the following error message:

Gave up waiting for root device. Common problems:
- Boot args (cat /proc/cmdline)
- Check rootdelay= (did the system wait long enough?)
- Check root= (did the system wait for the right device?)
- Missing modules (cat /proc/modules; ls /dev)
Alert! /dev/disk/by-uuid/82df63b6-8b97-4287-ae1b-db29565f5370 does not

Dropping to a shell!

BusyBox v1.18.5 (Ubuntu 1:1.18.5-1ubuntu4.1) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

(initramfs)

I'm assuming that the problem is GRUB is not finding the SATA device 
(although that is just a guess on my part). What do I have to do to get 
this box to boot?

Thanks.

An [SSH][1] daemon is the server-side software that allows you to
remotely login via an SSH client.  You end up with a shell (i.e.,
command line) session on the remote machine, over an encrypted
connection.

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell

If it's a stock Ubuntu install, it should have an SSH daemon running.
Try this from a shell on your laptop:

  ssh username at remote_hostname

You will be asked for your password on the remote host.  Once you're
logged in, you can attempt to restart the display manager.  The
Internet tells me that the various Ubuntus use [LightDM][2] by
default, so try:

  sudo service lightdm restart

[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightDM

The "sudo" command will ask for your password.  If the restart goes
according to plan, the frozen display should go dark briefly, and the
graphical login screen should reappear.  If it doesn't, and you don't
stand to lose any unsaved work, etc., it's probably simplest to
reboot.

Is this a brand new install that was broken from the start, or did it
work in the past?

The kernel can't find the root file system.  GRUB is configured to
tell the kernel which file system is the root file system.  There are
multiple ways a file system can be identified.  In this case, it's by
[UUID][1] (universally-unique identifier).  AFAIK, GRUB doesn't verify
that the file system exists.  It just passes the info on when it loads
the kernel into memory.

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuid

It could be that GRUB is configured with the wrong UUID for the root
file system, but that seems unlikely if this is a brand new install.
It's possible that the initramfs doesn't contain the driver module
necessary to access the SATA card.  (An initramfs is a file that, once
loaded into memory by GRUB, appears to the kernel as a stripped-down
root file system.  It is used briefly during the boot process, prior
to mounting the real root file system.)

Troubleshooting this could be a bit complicated for e-mail.  You might
consider hauling the computer to the clinic tomorrow.

you may try to boot with a live cd/usb (ubunutu installation meda may work too)

after booting in the console try "sudo blkid" command and compare with your disks ids.

If they are different you may try to change grub config manually. If they are the same (it is probably a kernel module issue). Then you sould obey the clinic advice...

There is no SSH daemon running on the desktop. After rebooting the
desktop I tried Russell's suggestion:

	$ pidof sshd

And just got another command prompt. 

More important to me is that this should not be happening in the first
place. Freezing X is pretty unforgivable for an OS, especially as the
hardware in this computer is pretty plain. That's why I'm thinking of
replacing Xubuntu with something less cutting edge. For this computer
stability is more important than features.

Can the computer function as needed without an X server at all, just 
console mode?  Then you could bypass all graphics-related issues.

If you don't need advanced graphics, using plain vesa mode by configuring
xorg manually [1] may also be preferrable option.

It happened again last night. As before, no warning, nothing in
messages or logs. And the sound continued; just X was stuck. 

After rebooting on Friday I applied all the Xubuntu 12.04 updates, some
of which related to X. I was hoping that might fix the problem, but
apparently it did not.

This computer ran straight Ubuntu 10.04 without a problem from the time
it was released until just a couple months ago when I finally did a
fresh install of Xubuntu 12.04. The freezes started after installing
12.04. It is always possible that it is hardware related, but if so the
hardware problem would have to have begun coincidentally right after
installing 12.04. 

I think I'm just going to shop for a distro that I can get with just
Xfce and multimedia codecs, and long term support, really, really long
term support. It's annoying always having to futz with things.

Not sure if you got this fixed at the clinic or not but thought I would
reply anyway.

At the shell if you type exit will the server go ahead and boot
correctly?

There is a problem I ran into (known but with the tools which create the
initrd IIRC) in my case I am using LVM but it might be worth it for you
to give the following a try especially if the computer booted properly
after typing exit at that shell prompt you mentioned.

When the grub screen is displayed edit the configuration and add
rootdelay=30 to the end of the kernel line.

If the root delay works and allows you computer to boot
edit /etc/default/grub and add/modify it so that you have a line like
the one below.

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rootdelay=30"

In my case rootdelay=2 actually works.  I just suggested 30 to give it a
bit longer for you.

This may not help you, but if not maybe it will help others.

Yes. This is what happened at the clinic.

It's one of the things we suspected, but we pretty much figured the real 
problem was the PCI card that runs the SATA hard drive. I don't have the 
model number handy right now, but Keith Googled it yesterday and found 
people were having problems with it about 10 years ago, which is the 
rough age of the machine.

When I get some free time this week I'll try your recommendation and see 
what I get.

Thanks for the tip.

Sounds like the same bug I ran into.  I bet the rootdelay option will
help you get going since this worked.  From what I have read it seems
that most people running into this are running software raid or using
logical volumes but it sounds like it is not limited to those
configurations.  FWIW the message you originally posted is included in
the upgrade document for Debian at
http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html#boot-timing

My computer is old and used but not used up so I for sure understand.  I
have not had any new problems once I added the rootdelay=2 option
to /etc/grub/default and then ran update-grub so that the grub
configuration files got updated.

My computer runs Debian and what is really strange is that it had work
for years without running into this problem until Wheezy was released
and the 3.8.x kernel made it into sid.  I can still boot the old 3.2.x
kernel but the 3.8 series requires the delay in order for it to work.

Hopefully it will work for you.

Subject: [PLUG] mailx question
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1305201458190.20630@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I use mailx to distribute newsletters to individuals in named lists. That
list is then passed to mailx on the command line, along with the message and
a subject line in double quotation marks. I want to learn if I can also add
an individual greeting (specifically, the recipient's name) to the body of
the mail.

   The man page seems to suggest that a mailx guru could use the -S option to
assign these names to a variable but I don't know how this would be done.

   Has anyone here used mailx like this and can offer me suggestions. Or, are
there other resources that might have examples of what I want to do?

TIA,

I've never used -S, so I'm not sure what setting internal variables in 
mailx does. The tool I'd normally reach for in this situation is m4. 
If, for instance, you were able to loop through a list of subscribers 
and assign $NAME and $ADDRESS, then

   m4 -D GREETING="$NAME" newsletter.m4 | mail -s "Subject" $ADDRESS

The newletter.m4 would contain the GREETING token which would get 
replaced with $NAME.

   Thanks, Paul. I'll read the m4 man page. And I see that mail is the same
as mailx. Interesting.

Great idea.  I have a server that I want to see how the sFTP client on it
works, I think it is going to force me to have pre-installed certificates
and not allow just plain old ID/Password authentication.
Test will take less than 5min.

I figured someone here would have it setup, I have a Ubuntu 10.x desktop
running with an older proFTPd that doesn't support sFTP. I made a feable
attempt upgrade it but it still shows it is running the same version as
when I started. So I thought I would try this avenue.

sounds like you're actually trying to use ftps, which is different from
sftp, and much less likely to just be floating around out there.

No I really do mean sFTP not FTPs. I miss used the term certificate. Should
have said key-pair. How ever I have confirmed via other means that I must
have shared an rsa ( or other ) key for this to work on this platform...

It seemed to be happening more and more frequently, so that made me
worry that it might really be hardware failing. So I burned Mint 14
Xfce and booted to it. I have been running it just from the live CD
without installing it for several days now, and no problems with X. If
it continues without problems for another week or so I'll go ahead and
install it. Then all I'll have to do is figure out how to get rid of
the Mint logo, which offends my artistic sensibilities.

Another reviewer observed 
    There is also remarkably little space on the drive, given it's
    capacity (320 G). That can be traced to an empty, extended 105 G

All,
I have a computer that won't boot, no beeps, nothing. The power supply
lights up and the cpu fan starts, but just silence after that. I've taken
everything out but the cpu and memory.

I was going to bring it to Northwest Computer Support to see if they could
isolate the problem, but they have become Blackpoint IT.

Does anyone know if they still take walk-ins or have another shop that I
can take the system too?

thanks,

   Ah, too bad. I had laptops fixed there and was well pleased with the
results.

   Actually not. But, I once had a CPU go bad. Someone here might have a
spare chip that will work in your system board and, if they loan you that
chip, you can test that for function.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux to be exclusive OS on ISS
Message-ID: <20130526132249.GA25171@jamhome.us>


Laptop computers essential to the day-to-day operations of the
International Space Station (ISS) crew will be switching operating
systems from Windows XP to Linux, according to published reports.

The laptops, which are on the space station?s ?opsLAN? network, are
used by astronauts to interface with onboard cameras and complete several
other routine tasks, Joel Gunter of The Telegraph explained on Friday.

While Linux had already been used to run several systems on board the
ISS, this means it will now be the exclusive OS used onboard the orbiting
laboratory, he added.

?We migrated key functions from Windows to Linux because we needed
an operating system that was stable and reliable ? one that would
give us in-house control. So if we needed to patch, adjust or adapt, we
could,? Keith Chuvala of the United Space Alliance, the organization
that operates opsLAN for NASA, told Gunter.

Hello,

I thought that by buying a Windows 7 computer I would avoid the dual boot
problems posed by Windows 8.  A couple months ago I bought a HP
h8-1360t with Windows 7 installed.  Unfortunately, it appears that this
computer is unfriendly to dual boot even though it runs Windows 7.

Can anyone tell me how to dual boot kubuntu 13.04 on my Win 7/HP h8-1360t?

Thanks,

Dan

It's also worth checking in with the support forum for your computer.
Usually, there's some good help there.

Typically, there is a BIOS setting to turn off UEFI:

Message-ID: <CAArUT0hAQcGgth9r58BN1fU9vVpdgqBR_FkCAE-iU+BYPkPBjg@mail.gmail.com>

I am ashamed, but I knuckled under and am running Unity.  Somehow I managed
to get plain Gnome-terminal on the Launcher some time ago.  When I tried to
get the same for a friend on her new install of 12.04, I could not find it
on Dash.  While trying to figure out what I had done to get it on my
machine, I detached it from the Launcher, and lost it!  Drat!, or words to
that effect.

So the search began. I did eventually find Byobu Terminal, attached it to
the Launcher, and it seemed OK, but with bells and whistles.  So I launched
the man page to try to understand the bells and whistles.  OK.  Closed the
man page and the instance of Byobu. Now Byobu launches but quits
immediately.

Don't you love the improvements we keep getting?

I am happy with plain Gnome-terminal.  Dash does not know about it.  Found
another terminal (XTerm), launched gnome-terminal, locked it to the
launcher, unlocked the broken Byobu terminal, and now I am back to where I
want to be.

Anybody here foolish enough to run Unity and have advice on how to more
efficiently deal with Dash and the Launcher?

I find that hard to believe. Every computer mother board has some sort
of BIOS, EFI or not. Otherwise it can't load the bootloader off the
hard drive or report what hardware it has to the OS, not to mention
operate all the hardware long before the OS has loaded any drivers.
One of the links I provided was the BIOS settings for the computer
model you provided. You may only have a fraction of a second to mash
"F10" "F2" "DEL" or whatever it was as the computer powers up.

Oops, stupid Blackberry. Got my thread headers confused. Comment still
stands though. You still have a BIOS in front of EFI. You may have the
BIOS setup software on a hidden partition of the original harddrive. I
hate when they do that!

BIOS is defined as the antiquated IO systems for PCs. EFI is a replacement, and not technically BIOS. According to the link below, EFI is just a software interface between the OS and the Firmware of a computer. It appears that you are calling EFI "BIOS" which it isn't.

There is no BIOS on my computer, as in, no keystroke to 'enter' BIOS and make changes to the settings. There's nothing to configure in a true (U)EFI based computer. There is a keystroke to cause the system to boot from the optical drive, USB or network. There is a keystroke to force the EFI to scan the system, and configure itself. 

But the human on the meatspace side of the keyboard can't make any manual changes. 

This is also why my computer does not support a floppy, unless it's attached to the USB port. Then it looks like just another thumb drive. No reason to clog up the works with a slow floppy interface.

Message-ID: <CAMs1osPD64N7mdkR+MMqRiheHg1_DW5pY8gcGaSnestNSq2B9A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I didn't see a way to turn off UEFI in the bios, but I did make some
progress. Here's what I did:
1. installed Kubuntu 13.04 from DVD
result: installation completes, but if I allow the computer to boot
normally I get the single line of text
grub rescue>
I don't see any obvious way to progress from this.
2. boot while holding down the <ESC> key to enter the Startup Menu
If I choose Boot Menu/UEFI options/Windows, it will boot Windows
If I instead choose Boot Menu/UEFI options/Kubuntu, I'll be left with the
"grub rescue>" prompt again.
3. choose Run UEFI Application.../File Browser select HDD: WDC
WD10EZEX-60ZF5A0/File Browser select EFI/File Browser Select kubuntu/File
Browser select grubx64.efi
I get the following screen:
"
GNU GRUB version 2.00-13ubuntu3

Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported.  For the first word, TAB lists
possible command completions.  Anywhere else TAB lists possible device or
file completions

grub>
"

If I then press <TAB>  I get a page of possible commands, including
"chainloader" "linux" "linuxefi" "boot" "xnu_kernel" and many others.

My question is - can I somehow boot kubuntu from this grub prompt?

Thanks,

Dan

This motherboard: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157262 does not have BIOS. While it may have a keystroke to access "BIOS Settings" this are actually an interface to the UEFI, and there is no BIOS.

i'm liking Unity a lot more since i figured out how to disable the 
annoying global menu (at least to the extent of having application menus 
back in the app windows).

anyway, this thread offers a couple of possible solutions to you problem 
of items not showing up in the Dash.

http://askubuntu.com/questions/225519/applications-not-showing-in-unity-dash

Also, fwiw, if you're a heavy terminal user, you should look at 
terminator (in the standard repo), a multi-pane container for 
gnome-terminal.

You can get an ICON for terminal on you desktop using the following
technique.

   - Open a Nautilus window (that's your GUI file browser)
   - Maneuver to /usr/share/applications.
   - Find there Terminal icon
   - Right-click and select Copy To
   - Select Desktop

You should now have a terminal icon on you desktop that will start
Gnome-terminal.
This technique has worked for years even pre-dating Unity

Does <ctrl><alt>t still work under Unity? I used to have a terminal icon 
in the (whatever that top bar of icons  is called). While I'm not using 
Unity, I am using Ubuntu 12.04 in Gnome Classic (?) mode, and

It does work.  But since I had already created an icon for gnome-terminal
in the launcher, I cannot determine if it would still work if that icon
were absent.

Message-ID: <CAHMmuJV-dMSygsLDncViCFUN5xQHB7unM9QsJS5xLSdVTYTnZQ@mail.gmail.com>

This laptop runs about 1000-1200.  This is with the 1600x900 mate display,
128GB SSD, 6 GB RAM, intel wifi and dell blue tooth.

As people are discussion real quality systems for running linux I wanted to
point out this not so advertised model.

It has an 8 hour battery.  A very high quality keyboard.  reasonable track
pad and pointing stick.  The display is reasonable quality.  It is mate but
not ips.  I have found it totally workable.

I have not had any device problems so far with ubuntu.   I am also running
windows 7.  Will be moving to a Linux with win 7 in virtual box as the
linux side is more tested.

Ubuntu has been more stable on this laptop then my desktop at home.  Both
running latest 13.04.

Insides of the device are great.  Battery is removable.  Then miniSata for
drive, memory, wifi, and bluetooth cards are all accessible with two screws.

It is a mid weight box.  But I am happy to trade the weight for the access
and repairable laptop.

I do not have the Wi Gig card or wireless dock.  Sorry can't help  you
there.

Dell win 7 install is very reasonable but with office and apps it is around
40GB.  Slightly problematic.

My goal is to run the win 7 from the partition it is on in virtual box and
natively.  It looks like this is possible.  Happy to update anyone who is
interested in that attempt directly.

All FN buttons and audio controls are working right now. I have a few more
items to test.

This should not be a problem at all.  I have dual booted both win 8 and win
7 with linux.  The question is whether you want to do it with Secure EFI,
EFI, or BIOS only modes.  I am double full your Win 7 box shipped with
secure EFI but you may have to figure out exactly what state the firmware
is in and which partition type you need to support it.

I am a fan of vanilla EFI.  However there are a lot of things that get done
to mess up the EFI to work with win systems.

The crazy partition setup that has a gpt and a protective messed up MBR
partition that is used is a real mess.  So for Win 8 I went back to BIOS
only mode.  Win 8 is happy to install on a MBR partition on a BIOS only
mode device.

You just need to be clear at the end state you are shooting for.  And the
current state of your windows partitions and disk partition label.

Most configs are possible if you are starting from scratch.  Getting there
from one or the other can be problematic.

For example if you take win 8 secure laptop and reinstall linux on it you
may get a non working partition table.  Because of the protective MBR GPT
stuff I mentioned above.  I spend way too much time dealing with a partial
install before I went back to BIOS only mode.

Interesting.  Since Byobu is the default terminal, how does it know to
launch gnome-terminal on  ctrl-alt-t?

Subject: [PLUG] Mint 14 Xfce issues
Message-ID: <20130528192649.1f15ec8c@Devil8>

My desktop computer has only three functions: Stream internet radio,
play videos, and serve as a backup method to get on the net when I
hopelessly mess up my laptop. It ran Lucid until a few months ago when
I made a fresh installation of Xubuntu 12.04. Unfortunately, there is a
problem with Xubuntu 12.04 and the graphics (Geforce 6150 on the
motherboard) causing intermittent lockups in X. A week ago I decided to
try Mint 14 Xfce, which I ran for many days just from the live CD. No
problems with lockups, so yesterday I installed it, wiping out Xubuntu.

But now I find numerous problems with it. For starters, in the terminal
the "jjj at Devil10" is in Mint green. I can't stand that color, and
besides it's really hard to read. I can't find any setting to change it,
although I can change the color of the background and the rest of the
text. I installed Gnome-terminal, but it also comes up with the same
color. Must be a Mint thing. Is there a way to excise Mint green, or
did I make a bad distro choice?

Also, I can ask questions on the Xfce forums, but to do so I should say
what version of Xfce I have. How can I find out what version of Xfce I
have?

I assume you mean the terminal prompt, rather than the titlebar text.
Check your ~/.bashrc file.  You should find one or more lines like:

    tput setf n

where "n" is an integer number representing the color of your
text.  ("setf" stands for "set_foreground", meaning to set the
foreground text color.)  I do something similar, causing my prompt
to be displayed in bold white.  If I su to root, the prompt
changes color to red.  I find this quite helpful.

Forgive me, but you'll have to determine the color-to-number mappings
yourself.  It's been too long, and I've forgotten what they are.
Also, you'll want to check the man page for tput(1) and terminfo(5).
The latter will tell you what the terminal capability names are that
you need to feed tput.

I believe the command "xfce4-about" will turn the trick.

Hope this helps.

Thanks for the info. Yes, I meant the terminal prompt. I'll work on this
later.

I had to install xfce4-utils first, but having done so, the above
command tells me everything about Xfce4 except what version I have. 

I tried apropos xfce4, which gave me about 20 commands related to xfce4,
but none that would give me the version number. Evidently this is a
closely held Mint state secret.

I have Mint 13 on my laptop, and it has Mate desktop not Xfce.
However, you should be able to see the installed version from within the
Synaptic Package Manager.
It shows columns for package name, installed version, latest version, and
description.
I can't remember if this is default software or not, I have always used it
on Debian/Ubuntu based systems.
If you don't have it, you can install it from apt on command line, or the
default Software Manager.

You should also be able to get the version info from apt itself, with the
command:

$ apt version [packagename]

Just supply it with one of the main package names for xfce.

Hello all,

I have various inquires out for June but no confirmations. I invite YOU 
to give it a go, especially if you have never presented before. I also 
have two topics of my own: The bhyve talk I gave in Tokyo and Ottawa 
(now boots Linux guests but that isn't in the wild yet) and some ZFS 
testing I have been doing in a controlled environment. In short, just 
what impact is there to:

Adding a ZIL
Enabling and disabling various caching
Turning some knobs like prefetch
Comparing NFS to CIFS to AFP to iSCSI
Making dd output more useful
Making sense of iozone, fio, xdd and friends (at best seeing the tip of 
the iceburg on these long, slippery slopes)

And the like.

Thoughts? Requests?

Hi

I have some suggestions for speakers from ones I attended at LinuxFest if that would be of interest.

I just lurk on the list as I'm out of town.

Subject: [PLUG] Needs some speakers have some of my own topics


Hello all,

I have various inquires out for June but no confirmations. I invite YOU to give it a go, especially if you have never presented before. I also have two topics of my own: The bhyve talk I gave in Tokyo and Ottawa (now boots Linux guests but that isn't in the wild yet) and some ZFS testing I have been doing in a controlled environment. In short, just what impact is there to:

Adding a ZIL
Enabling and disabling various caching
Turning some knobs like prefetch
Comparing NFS to CIFS to AFP to iSCSI
Making dd output more useful
Making sense of iozone, fio, xdd and friends (at best seeing the tip of the iceburg on these long, slippery slopes)

And the like.

Thoughts? Requests?

Can anyone recommend a service I can use that will provide my work with
secondary mail service to catch email when we are down and then forward to
my primary when we are back up.

One option I've seen is http://dyn.com/email/dyn-email-backup-mx/
Does anyone have experience with them?

What good is a forum designed for posts if how to post isn't obvious?

I would appreciate a clue stick on where to find the link to start a 
post on the LibreOffice forum site.

Thanks.

Subject: [PLUG] Loosing columns in LibreOffice Writer
Message-ID: <51A7F287.90908@comcast.net>

I have been using Word Perfect in Virtual Box to produce a three column 
page. It has worked fine for me for several year. However, it does 
require starting up Virtual Box. The concept is simple enough that I 
should be able to do the job in LibreOffice Writer. In fact, I can 
generate a three column page in LO Writer, and it prints fine. The 
problem comes when I save, and then re-open the file. Instead of having 
three columns, I have three pages. I turned on the feature that shows 
separator line between the columns, and these still show. But I can't 
get to the second and third columns.

Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks.

AFAIK, Libreoffice doesn't much advertise its official forum (no link to
it) just a Q&A site: http://ask.libreoffice.org/en/questions/
You just ask a concise question at the top.

If you mean this one, http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/forum/ then
you need to log in.  This forum appears empty.

If you mean the LO nabble mailing list...either mail it in, or click
"new topic" on the nabble web gateway.

If you mean this one: http://en.libreofficeforum.org/
I don't know who runs this but it ain't LO. whois record shows owner is
hidden via a Toronto Privacy company.

Works fine here with LO Writer Version 4.0.2.2.  I opened an old MS Word
97 doc, coverted to 3 columns, saved, it reopened fine.  I don"t have WP
docs so can't test that one.

Now, when you save your document, did you explicitly say to save in ODT
format?  I think, LO, by default, tries to save back into the original
file format and the conversion to WP my be gimpy.

Anybody know of any problems like that?  Or some place to look?

Fred,

   Any 'system necessary' files will be Microsoft-specific. On all the
portables I've bought over the years I've just run cfdisk to repartition the
drive and installed linux. Put the boot loader in the master boot record
(MBR) and you'll be good to go.

Chances are, you can't keep those hidden partitions and install Linux. 
If you want to keep those partitions (in case, say, you need to call 
for support or install a BIOS upgrade), you can either

  1. Swap out the factory HD for another, keeping the original in a
     safe place;

  2. Use Clonezilla (or an equivlent) to store a full-drive image
     in a safe place.

This last one is the only one I knew about. Next time I'll try the first

Thinking you might be on to something I tried again, starting with a new 
document opened from within LO Writer (as opposed to using the default, 
which I have set to .doc, since that's what I have to use for the work I 
do.) Instead of copying and pasting anything, I typed each line in sort 
of generically -- "Line one, line two," etc. When I finished the first 
column I inserted a manual column break and pasted a copy of column one 
into column two. I repeated that for column three. Then I saved as .odt, 
.docx, and .doc. I opened each, and they all looked correct.

Next I took a copy of the .doc version, selected all, deleted, and typed 
in the text I usually use. I copied and pasted some text from a .txt 
file. As with the preceding test I inserted manual column breaks and 
pasted column one into columns two and three. I saved it. Since it was a 
.doc, it saved as .doc. I shut down LO Writer and reopened what I just 
saved. The three columns became three pages, again. However, I noticed 
some blank lines that hadn't been there before. After deleting the blank 
lines I still had three pages. But when I inserted a manual column 
break, moved to the newly created column, hit delete, the text on page 
two moved up into column two. I repeated the process of deleting blank 
lines that shouldn't be there in column two, inserted a manual column 
break, and hit delete. Then I did the same thing for the text that moved 
up into column three. When I was finished I saved, closed, and reopened. 
This time the page looked like it should.

I also figured out how those blank lines got there. Sometimes, when I 
paste in some text, it wraps to the next line. To keep things lined up I 
insert a tab at the beginning of the second line. However, even though 
it now looks right, it's not. What I need to do is insert a new line 
character at the end of the first line, and then insert the tab at the 
beginning of the second line.

Anyway, I now have a process that works. And more importantly, I can 
produce a template I can hand over to someone else so that they can do 
this task on their copy of MS Word in the future.

Thanks for giving me the hint to take a more step by step approach to 
tracking down the real problem.

Its actually an upstream bug and the only reason its not affecting
Mint yet is because Mint is shipping older packages.
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47288 indeed its
affecting both Ubuntu and Fedora
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61287 but is not a Ubuntu
or Fedora bug.
