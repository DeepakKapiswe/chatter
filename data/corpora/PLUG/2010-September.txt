I am working with a USB drive supplied to us by a former contract company
that contains a backup of an Oracle databse. Looking at the file system, I
see this:

drwxr-xr-x  6 60004 60004  4096 Jan 25  2010 .
drwxr-xr-x 11 root  root   4096 Feb 20  2007 ..
drwxrwxrwx  4 60004 60004  4096 Dec  5  2007 6614448.992
-rw-------  1 60004 60004 16883 Jan 25  2010 .bash_history
-rw-r--r--  1 60004 60004   901 Oct 23  2009 .bash_profile
-rwxrwxrwx  1 60004 60004   424 Feb  1  2008 check_patches1.sh
-rwxrwxrwx  1 60004 60004  1220 Feb  1  2008 check_patches2.sh
As you can see, the owner and group are showing just a number. My guess is
this is the user id of the owner as it existed on the original server. Is
that correct? The company gave me a set of users to recreate but not the
original Second, is there a way to determine what correct this?
Unfortunately, asking the contractor is not an option.

Thanks,
Robbert van Andel

Looks like the user this referred to is lost.  This is a good reason to
backup the password files along with a data backup.  I don't think there
is any way to figure out what is supposed to be in /etc/password from
the bare number.  If the user id was the same one that the database
used, then set up Oracle if at all possible and chown to the Oracle 
user id.  Ask an Oracle expert if there is a backup of Oracle how to
extract from Oracle what the user name was from the id.  If the user
id doesn't have to be the same as the database id, my guess is that
you can set a new user/group to 60004 with a name of your choosing.
Thing is, and others can verify this probably, Oracle might be 
expecting a specific user name and group name stored in the data 
itself.

Try googling the following:
find database name oracle

I wonder if the tool mentioned in the above link was used to make the
backup?

actually it was created using cp -av. I'll try the chown method.

My brother-in-law Sean Ressler could give you the answer as he does
Oracle for a living.  I'm worried that there is some proprietary
procedure you need to get the username/groupname set right.
I'm sure there are other Oracle professionals around as well, anyone?

I'm not sure that the account name/group has any real meaning as the
connection to the database
does it's own authentication.
The contents of .bash_history would probably revel some needed clues.

Robbert,

   I've seen owner/groups as numbers on downloaded source files; they don't
prevent me from running.

   Regardless, as root you can change the owner and group to whomever you
want and go from there.

Correct.? Names in text are, like DNS Hostnames, a convenience for
human beings.? the numbers, be they UIDs, GIDs or IP Addrs are what count
to the machine.

If you have access to the original server you can
check it.

You can either sudo chown the files to any user on the system, or you can
create a new user and group with that number (60004) for user id (uid) and
group id (gid).

If you just create the same user on two systems they the user may have
different uid and gid on each system and your situation would arise.

? ? Berkeley DB originated at the University of California,
? ? Berkeley as part of the transition (1986 to 1994) from 4.3BSD
? ? to 4.4BSD and of the effort to remove AT&T-encumbered code.
? ? It has evolved a great deal since then and is now part
? ? of Oracle where it is distributed with source code under
? ? a dual use license.

? ? Berkeley DB (BDB) is a computer software library that provides
? ? a high-performance embedded database, with bindings in C, C++,
? ? PHP, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, Smalltalk, and other languages.
? ? BDB stores arbitrary key/data pairs as byte arrays, and supports
? ? multiple data items for a single key. BDB can support thousands
? ? of simultaneous threads of control or concurrent processes
? ? manipulating databases as large as 256 terabytes, on a wide
? ? variety of operating systems including most Unix-like and
? ? Windows systems, and real-time operating systems.

All,

Does anyone have good ways to debug running processes without restarting
them?

I've used truss before, but I've always restarted the process for it.
Any recommendations would be appreciated.

thanks,

You needn't restart a process to use strace/truss. Just point it at an 
existing PID:

   strace -p $PID

It's more difficult, of course, if the parent process starts up 
multiple long-lived forks or threads, but a single-threaded process 
won't pose any difficulty.

Well, the process itself will be multi-threaded. That's where the vendor
thinks things are going wrong, and the hope is getting the strace output
on the processes will allow us to catch an issue as it happens.

Is there a big performance hit in running strace (this is SLES 10) and
dumping to a file? It might be easier just to use -o and preventively
write all the output beforehand?

I usually dump to a file rather than stdout, just because the spew 
comes at such a high rate. Unless the machine's CPU or I/O subsystem 
is already overloaded, you shouldn't have much trouble writing to a 
file. Keep an eye on file size -- strace dumps can be large -- and you 
should be just fine.

Funny you ask as I was reading about this very same question last
night. I haven't tried out the methods described yet so YMMV

Drew,

   Not at all funny, as it's a serious concern. I'd like to use a CMS for my
site, take advantage of httpd and postgres running here, yet keep my
business financial information and the rest of my system secure from any
successful httpd incursion.

   The above answers half my question: yes, with sufficient work, knowledge,
and attention to detail httpd can be isolated from the rest of the system.

   The other half of the question is whether individual applications can be
secured.

Thanks for the pointer,

Rich

An alternative, if you have spare machines (real or virtual), is to 
proxy the application through your public web server to another 
machine that's not directly accessible from the Internet and hosts 
little information of value.

In your case, I suspect it's overkill, but it's a very handy solution 
in those cases where you want to

* delegate administrative privileges to someone who doesn't have the
   same privileges on the main web server

* want to ensure that the application can't monopolize CPU or IO
   resources the main web server needs to have

* the application requires resources or versions you don't want on
   your main web server

Paul,

   If I had another system (and the room for it), that would work well.
Unfortunately, that's not an option now. I could set up a virtual machine,
but I don't know when I could make the time to learn how and actually do it.
:-(

Many thanks,

Rich

Hi Rich,

Absolutely. I have experience with BSD jails and I have to say that I
love them. Really, BSD jails, in my experience, are a "wonder" technology.

Here's an overview/HOWTO:

The '-f' option causes strace to follow forked child processes, so you
can attach to the parent before a child with an as-yet-unknown PID
spawns.

An aside: anybody else been impressed with the ksplice blog? They've
had some great articles there.

VirtualBox is very easy to set up. All pointy-clicky and stuff, with a
very nice CLI if you're so inclined. I'd be surprised if learning how
to isolate your web servers from the rest of the host wasn't
significantly more time consuming.

I don't use Ubuntu very often and don't know the answer off hand and
don't have time to do research on this at the moment.

Would some Ubuntu user answer Craigs question for me.
Send the answer directly to Craig as he isn't (yet) a PLUG member.

THE QUESTION IS:

David,

I am the person that spoke to you at the fair today about VBasic,
parallel port control of step motors etc.  I just installed Ubuntu on
a Win 7 computer to run as a choice on the initial startup.  It comes
up with a window for a name and password entry.  I tried to enter a
password of my choice and used my name but I can not get anything to
go forward from that point.  Is there an initial name/password
combination that I need to get things going?

Paul,

   I need to upgrade my server/workstation's distribution. After that I can
create a VM and run another instance of httpd there just for the
outward-facing Web site.

Thanks for the suggestion,

David,

If he installed Ubuntu, the installer would have prompted him for a
username and password. That's what he would use to login. If he's using
the livecd, then there shouldn't be a username and password, at least
not in the most recent builds (~since 8.04?). I'm not familiar with
earlier versions than 8.04.

In addition to what Daniel said, there is a password file somewhere
that theoretically can be edited. I recall once at a Clinic we needed
to reset a user's password. If I recall correctly the guru who
attempted this was Keith, however, I also recall that we failed.

I know I have seen "lost password" posts on the Ubuntu forums more than
once. The forums are accessible by web browser and are searchable:

http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=327

I would recommend searching the Installation and Upgrades forum. I
would do so myself, but I am off to paint a house.

   This is so simple I'm embarrassed to ask for help. But, ask I must.

   In /var/www/htdocs/ I have phpinfo.php (perms 777); the file content is:
<?php
phpinfo();
?>

   When I try opening the file (ctrl-o) I see a blank page with "Done" on the
firefox status line. When I enter the URL of http://localhost/phpinfo.php I
see the file's content.

   What am I doing incorrectly?

Thanks,

This is normal, phpinfo(); will only generate a report when rendered
through apache/php interpreter. if you want a copy of the output, view
it as http://localhost/phpinfo.php, then ctrl+s to save it as an html
file on your computer.

   Unfortunately, for this situation, the live web site is not hosted here,
so any php information returned would refer to that installation and not my
local server.

Run "php -a" from an xterm on the server to get a PHP interactive shell.
then from the PHP prompt you can run the command "phpinfo();".

Carlos,

   Well, that explains the problem.

   I don't have MySQL installed and php is apparently configured to require
it. It cannot find the mysql libraries. Guess I need to rebuild php to fit
my system.

Thanks,

   Something is screwy here. When I look at the build file for php I see that
it's configured with pdo-sqlite enabled (which is what I wanted to use
phpinfo.php to determine), so that's OK.

   However, I'm not able to get the CMSs I'm trying to evaluate to install. I
tried the drupal-sqlite patch, but nothing happens when I try to run
install.php. The instructions for the elxis CMS (which is installed in
/var/www/htdocs/elxis/) say to point the browser there and the installation
page should display. I see only the directory contents.

   Is this a php issue, an httpd issue, or a major user error that I'm not
seeing? Sigh.

It is probably an httpd config issue.  The original html you posted, if works
then the install.php should work.  Normally you will need to enable
php processing .so library.
At least on my system in /etc/httpd
httpd]# ls
conf  conf.d  logs  modules  run

all are directories but logs, modules and run are links to other locations.
modules should have something like libphp5.so along with a bunch of
mod_*.so files
Also for me when I installed php I got a config file /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf
Below is the relevent portions without the comments.
-------------------
<IfModule prefork.c>
  LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so
</IfModule>
<IfModule worker.c>
  LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5-zts.so
</IfModule>

AddHandler php5-script .php
AddType text/html .php

DirectoryIndex index.php

Message-ID: <1283548382.2109.5.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to improve the reception for a wireless link from a WAP11 to
a Linux box.  I have three of them.  Two of them are version 2.6 models
whereas one of them is a version 2.2 model with USB port.

A couple of questions:

Can these units bridge without running a crossover cable between two of
them?  Can these units bridge with the ethernet unplugged?  Can two of
these units be used to connect one ethernet segment to another ethernet
segment wirelessly?  Can there be multiple repeaters?  How do I set up
multiple repeaters?  What is the difference between a WAP11 and a WET11?

Larry,

   Here I have:

[root at salmo /etc/httpd]# ls
extra/      magic       mod_php.conf  php.ini
httpd.conf  mime.types  original/     sql-ledger-httpd.conf

> all are directories but logs, modules and run are links to other locations.
> modules should have something like libphp5.so along with a bunch of
> mod_*.so files

   I have that library in mod_php.conf:

[root at salmo /etc/httpd]# grep libphp5.so *
mod_php.conf:LoadModule php5_module lib/httpd/modules/libphp5.so

> Also for me when I installed php I got a config file /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf

   I've mod_php.conf and php.ini. There must be a critical line or three
commented out somewhere. When I try to run php from the command line I get
errors:

[root at salmo /etc/httpd]# php -a
PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library
'/usr/lib/php/extensions/mysql.so' - libmysqlclient.so.15: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory in Unknown on line 0
PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library
'/usr/lib/php/extensions/mysqli.so' - libmysqlclient.so.15: cannot open

PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library
'/usr/lib/php/extensions/pdo_mysql.so' - libmysqlclient.so.15: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory in Unknown on line 0
Interactive mode enabled

   Yet, in /usr/lib/php/extensions/ there is mysql.so, mysqli.so, and
pdo_mysql.so. However, libmysqlclient.so.15 is not installed. Could that be
the problem?

Thanks,

Rich

   How strange! More Google searching found a thread with this problem and
the solution is to install mysql! Imagine, Pat requires mysql to be present
in order to run php. Sheesh! Solves the problem here, too.

   What a PITA this is. Oh, well.

This is what I thought, but I could say for sure as I have personally
installed Ubuntu in a long time.

In any case, Craig wrote back to say he had solved the problem.

Thank you everyone.

   Installed MySQL. Can run 'php -a' interactively from the command line.
Still cannot get the appropriate address to run phpinfo.php in the browser.

What was the reference to Vbasic? Is that Microsoft's visual basic, 
or another basic. In any case, is there a good basic compiler for Linux?

Thanks

   I've not found the appropriate Google search term for this situation and I
hope one of you can point me to the appropriate doc so I can learn how to
fix the problem.

   When I point firefox to http://localhost/drupal-sqlite/install.php,
http://localhost/elxis/install.php, or http://localhost/phpinfo.php I see
the file contents rather than having it run. When I point the browser to
http://localhost/appl-ecosys/index.shtml the home page of my web site
displays.

   I can invoke php interactively from the command line. What might be
missing or mis-configured to cause this result?

TIA,

Rich

   In /etc/httpd/httpd.conf is the line

Include /etc/httpd/mod_php.conf

   That file contains:

# Load the PHP module:
LoadModule php5_module lib/httpd/modules/libphp5.so

# Tell Apache to feed all *.php files through PHP.  If you'd like to
# parse PHP embedded in files with different extensions, comment out

AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

# Tell Apache to feed all *.php, *.html, and *.htm files through

# and insecure, so be sure to know what you're doing.  It's a convenient
# shortcut, but probably isn't suitible for high-traffic sites if you

#AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .html .htm

# This will display PHP files in colored syntax form.  Use with caution.
#AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

It's starting to look like Apache isn't completely configured to serve 
php scripts.

On a CentOS 5 box I admin there is a config file named php.conf in 
/etc/httpd/conf.d with these "php" lines (found with grep).

LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so
LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5-zts.so

AddHandler php5-script .php

AddType text/html .php
DirectoryIndex index.php

 From your message I think you're missing AddHandler

   There's also the directive DirectoryIndex. That was set to index.html.
Changing that directive to index.php solved the problem.

Yea!

This used to work but no longer. If I want to search on a specific
phrase I enclose it in double quotes:

"The Underwater City"

Now, Google reports all sites that contain "the" and "underwater" and
"city," even though the words are scattered throughout the web site.

How can I get Google to respect the fact that I want only sites that
contain the phrase as a specific string?

I just tested this by using the advanced search for specific the exact
wording or phrase and it put the whole string in dbl quotes and all the
results on the 1st page contained that phrase. I then did a simple search on
it w. dbl quotes and got the same results. It appears to work as I would
expect it to...?

I repeated the test but without going through the advanced option (i.e., 
I only did the phrase in dbl quotes as a simple search) ... my results 
were that same as Mike's, at least as far in as 3 pages worth.
Am I missing something?  Sorry if this is of no help.

Correction:
This turns DVD's into avi's. I don't know much about the reverse process.

It is spelled DeVeDe and I have had good success with it too.  You can also
check out todisc, I haven't tried it but it sounds like another option.

I'm pretty sure Avidemux can do this, but I've never tried it. I think
you can also do it with K3b but, again, I've never tried it.

I found DeVeDe to be quite limited compared to Dvdstyler. If you just
want a bunch of AVI files converted to DVD titles or chapters, the
ease of use of Dvdstyler can't be beat (you load the files as chapters
or titles, remove the main menu and click "burn"). If you want menus
to go to each title or chapter, it's pretty easy to do, but you do it
one button at a time (I'd like some batch-like options like "create
buttons for each title").

   That shows me the source, all right:

<? phpinfo(); ?>

   Is there a syntax error in there? Does it matter if it's on one line or

So your web server is treating the php file as plain text. 
Common config problem, lots of web pages, including archives of this list,
speak to what to do.

Subject: [PLUG] Wii to ISO
Message-ID: <1283727274.3239.4.camel@ubuntuthink>

Folks, 

sorta related to the AVI to DVD thread, I've been wondering how to back
up our Wii DVDs. I've gotten one of the DVD-ROMs that are supposed to
read Wii DVDs (GDR-8164b), but haven't yet gotten the DVD recognized. At
least dd doesn't work. I see reports of k3b working, but that's not
happening either. 

But it may be related to the external housing, may just have to get a
SATA to IDE adapter to get it internal. 

If anyone here has done it with Linux, help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Mike

   Huh? That's html-formatted and doesn't display in alpine ... except with
difficulty.

   But, I was missing the language directive, php, before the function. That
makes sense. Since I know no php I didn't see that.

Thanks,

Rich

A little background information on this. The reason why PHP code shows
up as nothing, but looks fine under view --> source is because with
SGML and XML, items between <? and ?> are processing instructions and
thus the web browser doesn't render them. Odds are, the browser is
getting Content-Type: text/html in the HTTP headers.

Chroot doesn't provide the resource restrictions (needed to provide

If your running a distro with a recent kernel and the lxc userspace

is a lot more mature.

Subject: [PLUG] KPhotoAlbum crash
Message-ID: <AANLkTinUW72reZH6SP9QE7gVM5t3zXgvhfLUjVhs=p7n@mail.gmail.com>

I have a consistent, reproducible crash (seg fault) of KPhotoAlbum  when I
run Maintainance->Recreate Exif Search Database.  I ran this Maintenance
item first after adding folders and files to my collection and getting the
message when starting KPA that it was necessary to do so.  I have done many
things chasing this problem, but the status now is that I removed the new
folders and files from the collection, transfered from my backups the
files exif-info.db and index.xml (from a time prior to my recent use of
KPA).

Now KPA starts and appears to run OK, but it still crashes if I
run Maintainance->Recreate Exif Search Database.  I found on
http://www.kphotoalbum.org/index.php?page=news this note: "New images was
not correctly inserted into the exif database (thanks to Bart Visscher for a
patch that fixes this.) Please rerun "Maintainance->Recreate Exif Search
Database" to ensure your database it working again."

I also observed that when a crash occurs the file exif-info.db gets
rewritten to be about 3KB, contains the text "SQLite format 3"; the good
file contains the text "This File contains an SQLite 2.1 database"

I tried to generate a backtrace which the crash handler thinks would be
useful, but have not been successful, even after over 2 hours of downloads
of debug files.

Testing this is complicated by the absence of complete documentation (there
are instructions as to where the docs are, but they are not there, at least
not functioning).  Also, it appears that it is not possible to point KPA to
another folder to experiment using some test jpg files.  Only on
installation can the folder name be given.

If anybody here is using KPA, I would appreciate it if you could
run Maintainance->Recreate Exif Search Database, look to see if SQLite2 or 3
is used, and offer any advice.  I have a considerable amount of data entry
invested in this program, and I would hate to have to replace it from
scratch.  When KPA is running, it is very convenient and friendly.

Thanks,
-Denis

from 4.6 Final to 5.5 Final.  A strange issue has popped up.  When I go
to restart the network interfaces I get a SIOCADDRT network is
unreachable error.  What having to do with an upgrade would cause this?
Oddly enough, networking seems to be working just fine despite the
error.

Wow!  I didn't think it was possible to upgrade between major versions
of RHEL/Centos.  It certainly isn't supported.

My guess is that you ended up with an older config file that conflicts
with a newer rpm.  Look at your *.rpmsave's and *.rpmnew's for things
that look different from your config files.  Then read the newly
installed man pages for those to see what to fix.

"Isn't supported" is a very mild way of communicating what the 
denizens on the CentOS mailing list would say, which would be more 
along the lines of "DON'T!"

We see this when the default gateway device is not reachable from the default
interface.

There is also the possibility that SELINUX which is on by default in
5.5 could be causing problems.
Possible but not likely.  A bunch of other stuff would be spamming the
log files if that was the case.

There is a log of can't reach 224.0.0.120 in my logs.  Hmm, I think
avahi is causing a problem and generating the error.

Okay folks, how do I stop this?  I have NOZEROCONF=yes
in /etc/sysconfig/network.

An upgrade from 4.6 to 5.2 and the 5.5 should not have been a big deal.
I am not running X, which probably would break.  If I have to back up
my custom scripts and apply to them to a fresh install of 5.2, fine.
Seems like this issue should be directly solvable though.

avahi is part of the zeroconf set that started shipping with RHEL5 (and others).
It normally doesn't cause problems, just consumes some CPU time and
memory resources, mostly very
small.

We had some problems with this type of thing when we were setting
the gateway in the /etc/sysconfig/network file instead of the
interface we wanted to use
for the default route.

Also you can turn avahi-daemon off by
chkconfig avahi-daemon off
service avahi-daemon stop

Maybe.  Depends.  Major to Major upgrades like this work when you boot
to the target distro and do upgrade as the command line option.
5.2 to 5.5 would not have the problems.  4.6 to 5.2 would have been
the place that
probably broke it.

Avahi spamming multicast? Weird .. I don't have any sage advice but

Okay, solved the network startup issue by explicitly indicating a
gateway for each network interface in the ifcfg-ethn files instead
of one gateway in /etc/sysconfig/network.

One odd problem left, on boot I get a cannot find usb 2-1 messages
even though nothing is plugged in to the usb ports.  During the
upgrade I had a dvd burner plugged into the usb, but I have since
taken it off.

Another area of trouble is getting the spamcannibal local web site to
work.  Every time I try http://xerxes.robinson-west.com/tarpit/ I get
a 403 forbidden message.  Nothing in the logs beyond that, so I am
having a heck of a time troubleshooting it.

Only need one as a default route.  If there are others those go into
route-<ifname>

That is because it probably has an alias reference in /etc/modprobe.conf

Even from localhost?
Maybe the httpd configs didn't get moded/upgraded as needed.  There are areas of
packages that may have changed.

Try adding NOZEROCONF=yes to the ifcfg-ethX file(s) for your network
interface(s).

How do you limit the IPv4 addresses that Net::EasyTCP binds to in server
mode?

I don't want it to bind to 0.0.0.0 2345 for example for security
reasons.

I prefer for example 192.168.5.500 2345.

Is limiting in server mode to one IP address possible?

I added this to httpd.conf, but I'm still getting 403 forbidden no

I'm running Apache 2.2.3.

Anyone else think that the spamcannibal docs are terrible?

Just add the host to the server side as an IP address, just like the
client example.
       $client = new Net::EasyTCP(
                mode            =>      "client",
                host            =>      'localhost',

The host being left out of the server says to listen on any ip/interface.
If you want to listen on only one then specify only one IP address.

Did you restart the service after the change or kill -SIGHUP the process?

Yes.

You normally see this in sample files to indicate this is information is
relative to your install and you need to change it.

E.G.

 "/var/www/cgi-bin" should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
    # CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.

Two random debugging thoughts:

  1. If SELinux is enabled, do "ausearch -m avc" to get a look at
     what's being denied

  2. Bump the debug level of your web server. If you're usinng Apache,
     try "LogLevel debug"

Subject: [PLUG] Network Transfer Speed Bottleneck Identification
Message-ID: <1284176535.2643.6.camel@nathan-laptop>

I have a home network running off a linksys wrt54g2 (802.11g) router,
and file transfers between pc's on the network over NFS are only getting
~6.5Mb/s... 

my understanding is that though 802.11g theoretically supports ~54Mb/s,
that real world experience is around 20Mb/s avg. As there's no other
traffic on the network, and neither pc involved in the data transfer is
working under a significant load, I am expecting to be seeing transfer
speeds around triple what i'm seeing. 

is this a realistic expectation being hampered by some
misconfiguration/hardware obstacle, or is what i'm seeing as good as it
gets? any insights into this are greatly appreciated.

regards,

nathan

> 54Mb/s for 802.11G is the "theoretical maximum". There's a few things that
can affect transfer speeds:

1. Signal quality / Interference - What is the signal quality on both
clients?
When you scan the wireless networks from your clients do you see other Wi-Fi
APs on the same channel? If there are many, you set your Wi-Fi AP to a
different channel.

2. Distance - How far away are the clients from the Wi-Fi AP? With 11.G,
after 100' the throughput drops off significantly to the point where it's
not all that much faster than "B".

3. Do the Wi-Fi cards in both computers support "G"? - If the Wi-Fi AP
supports 11.B & G, and a client connects at "B" it will force the other
clients to connect at "B" as well.
* If your seeing speeds of 6.5Mb/s, this almost sounds like what's happening
as the theoretical max is 11Mb/s and so throughput of 6.5 - 8Mb/s is about
on par with what you would see.

HTH!

I just replace the kernel?  Where can I get the configuration of the

I am unable to delete two files on a hard-drive that originally was in
a ntfs partition.
The files are named "." and ".."

Trying to use the rm -r -f command fails as does the rmdir command.  I
tried renaming them but that fails too.

I really need to remove these two files, how can I tell the linux OS
that they are not being used as a folder relocation command and
actually remove them?

Well, the reason you can't remove them is that "." is your current directory and ".." is the parent directory.

May I suggest reading:

Sorry for misleading the general reader, I DO understand that "." and
".." are in the file structure.

There IS some type of hidden file in the folder.

I tried using the "stat filename" command to locate the inode and then
use the "find . -inum inode# -exec rm -i -d -r * \;" command but it
still won't delete the folder.

Is there any lower level command that can actually go in and remove that inode?

Here's the result of the "stat filename" command -

I still cannot remove this folder from the NTFS partition.

I am trying to carefully archive data from a corrupted system and
running under Knoppix 6.01 CD so I can safely do this.

Okay, I took the hammer to the folder and removed it.

1. I tried to stop the ntfs mount under Knoppix, not successful, so I
did an init 6 command to stop Knoppix

2. I then yanked the hard-drive off the computer and mounted it on my
Windows XP system.

3. I then successfully remove the 2 folders.

4. I then could NOT remove the USB mounted drive, so I had to kill Windows XP

5. After Windows XP came down, I yanked the hard drive off the system

6. I remounted the hard drive under Knoppix again.

7. I am currently doing a vfat partition to ntfs partition backup under Knoppix

I honestly think that I had a file that should be used to troubleshoot
a bug in the mount.ntfs thread under linux.  Apparently I had a file
or directory that the linux OS cannot handle

Sigh.. this has consumed some time, and forced me to reboot 2 systems
to successfully remove that pesky file.

Anyways, problem solved.

For those who would like to know, apparently a multibyte or wide
character in the file name caused major problems.  The rm command
clobbered the name, and removed the directory listing, but was unable
to actually remove the file, and subsequently any further rm or rmdir
commands failed, with an error report that the directory was non-empty
(which is true)

Here's the error listing
knoppix at Microknoppix:/media/hdc1/windows/SendTo$ stat 3*
  File: `3\275 Floppy (A).lnk'
  Size: 129       	Blocks: 64         IO Block: 32768  regular file

The stat command fails:

cp: cannot stat `./windows/SendTo/3\275 Floppy (A).lnk': Invalid or
incomplete multibyte or wide character

The \275 is some type of multibyte character?

I believe I have experienced something like this when I was working with
a VIA EPIC system.  I had to re-compile the kernel as 386/586 with AMD
K2 support
not 686.  Took a while to figure out but I was doing everything via pxe without
any local storage.  It was a 2.4 kernel back then but I believe it to
be the same issue.

your suggestions for places to check reminded me that i probably failed
at 'asking good questions', and gave me some thoughts as to possible
causes. thanks mike.

here's answers to your follow-up questions, and some additional
information.

1a). signal quality - 80-100% dependent on where in the apartment i am
1b). interference - being in an apartment, there's a ton of other
networks around, and if i fire up dd-wrt on my spare router to do the
scan (not sure how to see other networks channels in network mgr/cli), i
see that most are on the channel 6, so changing channels is definitely
something i will be looking into.

2). distance - there's probably a max of 30 feet that i stray from the
router, but there's almost always an internal wall between the laptop
and the router, which i credit for getting 80% signal strength 25-30
feet away in the living room.

3). network configuration - the two pc's involved are basically in a
server/client configuration, w/ the "server" being an old HP laptop
running debian testing, which shares a 1TB external HDD over NFS. the
server is connected to the router via ethernet. i've tried changing the
port on the router as i initially thought this may have been tied to a
failing port, and i changed the cable at the same time to no effect.

the laptop is a newer dell inspiron 1545, running Ubuntu 10.10, which
connects over a WPA2 wlan w/ mac filtering (not sure if this would
contribute to overhead). the laptop has the dreaded Broadcom card in it,
so i currently have to run the broadcom-sta driver, though normal
network speeds are fine, so i don't think it's an issue on the "client"
network hardware configuration

add'l info: 
"client" fstab entry - 92.168.1.105:/media/disk       /media/net
nfs     soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192
"server" exports entry - /media/disk
192.168.1.0/24(rw,async,no_subtree_check)

other thoughts: 
by changing the wlan channel and switching to async export, was able to
squeeze about another 100KB/s out of the connection, though still much
lower than i'd hoped. i set the router to g-only mode to eliminate the
possibility of a b-mode connection causing the slower speeds, so it
doesn't seem that's what's going on.

one possibility might be the USB read speed on this older laptop (circa
2000), though i'm not sure how to test read-speed except...<pause for
googling>

okay, head-desk. hdparm -t /dev/sdb shows me this fabulous output:
hdparm -t /dev/sdb

/dev/sdb:
 Timing buffered disk reads:    4 MB in  5.50 seconds = 745.40 kB/sec

which is right in range with the maximum speeds i'm seeing. seems i've
found the bottleneck. if anyone has pointers from here on ways to
improve this, i'd be stoked, though i have a feeling this may be due to
crappy old USB ports.

ty much for your assistance.

regards,

Message-ID: <1284195873.4051.7.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I'm wondering how exactly this tarpit implementation is supposed to
work???

I have MailFilter installed and it appears to be working with postfix as
the MTA.  I also have clamav and spamassassin installed and they seem to
be working.  Now in theory, I should be able to build a blacklist or
import blacklists for spamcannibal to be able to know when to tarpit
someone.  So far, I've turned the queue rule off as that is clearly
dropping emails silently.  I'm not sure if I need an iptables queue
rule.

Michael Robinton's instructions at http://www.spamcannibal.org have a
lot to be desired.  There seems to be no troubleshooting advice.
Perhaps someone has set this up on their own mail server?

   Yup. Not the driver, but the resolutions in xorg.conf's Screen sections.
Open that file (don't know where the ubuntus put it, but on Slackware it's
in /etc/X11/), go to the screens section and you should see something like
this:

Section "Screen"
     Identifier     "Regular Screen"
     Device         "nVidia GeForce 6150"
     Monitor        "Acer LCD"
     DefaultDepth    24
     SubSection     "Display"
         Viewport    0 0
         Virtual     1440 900
         Depth       24
         Modes      "1440x900" "1280x1024" "1152x864" "1024x768"
     EndSubSection

   My Acer monitor does no more than 1440x900 (which is fine for eyeballs
with many miles on them), and I'll bet your Screen section shows no higher
resolution, either.

   Add the one you want at the left of the group.

Rich,
The newer versions of X.org autodetect everything so there is no 
xorg.conf (FYI this makes things really screwy when using a KVM switch 
because there is no "state info" available if the switch is set to 
another system at boot time - but that's a different story).  I have 
created several xorg.conf files by various means and had limited 
success.  I think the problem is further exacerbated by having two 
methods of setting resolution - one from nvidia and one from linux. 
Maybe I'll fool around with xrandr . . .

Frank,

   That's my understanding, but I thought the .conf file could be used if
present.

   Probably a good idea. Autodetection is not always a good idea. It would be
nice to be able to override what is detected by user-established
preferences.

   As I keep writing (and saying), while all progress involves change, not
all change involves progress. Sometimes we're too clever for our own good.

Good luck!

One of my biggest complaints about all the Linuxs is the seeming 
inability to get the display right.  Not to throw rocks, but how come 
Micro$oft gets it right about 99% of the time?  I can put W7 on this 
same system and it will see the display and set the correct resolution. 
  Circles will not look like footballs and . . .  well enough of that. 
You are absolutely right: we tend to do things because we can, not 
because we should.

Maybe I need more coffee.  Then I'll watch my friend play his match at 
the US Open.

   Probably because they and the hardware manufacturers/vendors are together
in bed to ensure displays work with the software ... as long as you buy new
hardware, of course.

   There you go: that's a plan.

   Two golf shops in Gresham have gone into the bunkers and disappeared in the
past few months. One had been at the corner of Burnside and Division for as
long as I've lived out here (17 years now), the other was relatively new
with the development of Burnside around Civic Drive (the latter sounding
more like a politician's promise than a street name, but what do I know?).
That's too bad, even though I don't golf.

   More coffee is always good.

Yup, since anything over 255 is more than a byte.

This is a much more interesting issue than what I first read last night. I agree that this /may/ be an .ntfs problem, but I'm not convinced. I certainly have had similar issues over the years and was able to resolve them with "sudo rm -Rf <path-to-parent directory>. I don't have an NTFS partition mounted that I can experiment with, but I would be interested in hearing about anyone else's success.

Congrats on fixing the problem, but /man/ that sounds like a BPITA.

Subject: [PLUG] too many identical md5sums - is this normal?
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=3iOCBf8xLsaGNaX2sXJR_KpwUOxiO5z036MAB@mail.gmail.com>

In running md5sums against my files, I found in my home folder that 522
files had the same identical md5sum (of the 176K+ files) but when I did a
search, they were not the same files, in fact most are different from each
other.

Is this normal, that 522 different files give identical md5sums? I have
another set of files with 191 identical md5sums.

Or is something broken with Ubuntu 10.4  64-bit linux?

I am concerned now, as it was my belief that identical md5sums are hard to
duplicate (with different files)

   Ah, good for you, Frank.

   We had issues with 9.10 on my wife's new Toshiba Satellite and that was
resolved by upgrading to 10.04.

   Fortunately for both of us there was a newer distribution available that
fixed the problems.

My first inclination would be to think that the files are hard-linked 
to one another. Do "ls -i" against some of the files with the same 
checksum. If the inode number is the same, that's the answer.

Paul:

I found the problem, hundreds of files have been hacked, replaced,
nulled out, basically disrupted.

That's why the md5sums are the same.

btw, the inodes are different, but the file contents have been eviscerated.

Because your problem doesn't map well to its strengths?

Without a use case description the question is difficult to answer.

Examples:
  Because you have something already developed in Oracle|MySQL|Sybase and 
    the conversion costs are not worth it.
  Because you need to control access at the database, not application, level.
  Because your political environment (read:  employer) forbids.

But none of those makes a lot of sense in a question vacumn.

   If you'll have multiple simultaneous users use PostgreSQL (or MySQL if you
insist). If the database is on an NSF-mounted drive you could also run into
problems.

   SQLite is a fully-relational dbms with triggers and other useful features.
It's great for embedded dbms back ends (ask the Firefox and Apple folks)
because everything in stored in a single file. It's quick, flexible,
standards-compliant, and has great support on the mail list (including the
lead developer.)

You have a drive sponsored by the National Science Foundation?

Just to add to the mix...

SQLite is the most *widely* deployed SQL database in the world.

I figure that anything I can think of is possible....   :-)
but......

HOW easy would it be to take one of my doll patterns, scan it into GIMP
(or whatever) then make everything longer but not wider?

keep in mind I have only recently learned about scanning and my use of
GIMP has not included image manipulation.

Is this a simple matter of learning something that already has easy
instructions clearly written down and I have not found them, or is it much
more complicated, like my last (and still working on) project of scanning
and filling out documents?

Thanks
Debra Hubbard

Or use ImageMagick's convert.  I'll bet that you could use -geometry
to stretch it out in one direction only.

Admitting that I am not an expert ... I have never seen that in Gimp 
but, you can do it in OpenOffice.
    Open a new text document
    Insert an image (Insert->Picture->From file)
    Grab and edge and push or pull it as desired (left mouse click and 
hold to drag, for example)
If an 8.5x11 sheet wouldn't work for you ...
    Format->Page->(and on the Page tab) change the settings under Paper 
Format
Hope that helps, but maybe someone knows a better way?
Regards
Fred James

<snip>

Here, let me google that for you.
http://www.google.com/search?q=fedora+12+kernels
Result #1, from linuxquestions.org, entitled:
"True Image boot problem: cmov feature not present on CPU"
This turns out to be regarding some proprietary software.

Result #2, from fedoraforum.org (ooh, maybe relevant!) entitled:
"Fedora 12 on eBox 3300- cmov error - FedoraForum.org"
Third post, first answer says, "From F12 onward a processor supporting cmov
(amongst others) is required: F12 Release Notes" [with a link to the F12
release notes]

Remaining results and a similar search on Centos 5 say the same thing, that
Fedora 12 and Centos/RHEL 5 no longer support your CMOV-less i586-ish CPU.

HTH, HAND,

"Fedora 12 requires an Intel Pentium Pro or better processor, and is
optimized for i686 and later processors. "

Fedora 12 (and possibly earlier ones) has ditched compatibility with i586
and earlier architectures in the default kernel.

Message-ID: <4C904B92.7000904@ambidexter.com>


Hello all,

I am sorry to be silent on Advanced Topics. Here's where I'm at:

I have applied to use the Free Geek meeting space with with the idea
that Linux Fund could provide beverages (including the correct one) and
pizza and ask for reimbursement through a tip jar. I realize that
order-anything-you-want is a long-cherished PLUG AT tradition from Zot's
first meeting on hacking the Fedora installer to use tape... but that
has the inherent problem that any place that welcomes groups like us for
meetings tend to go bankrupt. BYOB and P with a nonprofit's space should
be more reliable and will have very predictable costs.

One catch: Only the third Tuesday is available. I know this is a
conflict for at least one regular.

Thoughts?
/
I am waiting on one potential speaker but am very open to a plan B. Does
anyone have a talk they would like to give? I am trying very hard to
have a OGD1 board to demonstrate the programming of and that may be
suitable. I guarantee the audience would know more than me but it would
be hands-on.

Thank you very much to those who have pinged me about this!

Michael

Dear PLUG,

After the Roots Closure and August Dog Days of Summer, it's time for the
Portland Linux/Unix Group to beta test a new location and date:

Free Geek on the third TUESDAY of the month as opposed to Wednesday.

That would be September 21st at 7PM

http://calagator.org/events/1250459235

Having watched two venues go bankrupt, we will try a new strategy:
beverages (including the correct one) and Pizza (no fishies as per
special request) will be served and a donation requested.

Topic: UnTopic/Roundtable

John was concerned that the topic be of interest to him: Solved!
Timothy has suggested an online security best practices roundtable.
I will fill silent time with stories. You've been warned!

Caveat: our application for the space is still pending and we may find
ourselves a few blocks away at the Lucky Lab listening about how
Facebook is being used at the Oregon Humane Society.


Michael

Hey Michael,

I wanted to write briefly about the possibility of my providing a talk
about Artificial Neural Networks using Linux. I thought I might give
insights about what ANN's excel at and how to create and use them.

A picture is worth a thousand words:

  http://cooper.stevenson.name/?p=24

The red line in the graph is what the ANN predicted the price
fluctuations for the MSFT security. The green line is how the stock
actually moved.

I'd love to hear from you to share this technology; if you have
questions or would like to schedule an Advanced Topics meeting date, let
me know.


Very Best,

Announcing the September meeting of the Portland R User Group. More details can be found at the Meetup page for this meeting at http://www.meetup.com/portland-r-user-group/calendar/14457932/

Main talk:
"Getting Started with R"
M. Edward (Ed) Borasky

Lightning talk:
"R in the Wild: Qmedtrix"
Homer Strong

Social hour (following talks):
Le Hana Japanese Bar & Grill
3500 SW River Parkway


Location:
    OHSU Center for Health & Healing
    Room 3171
    3303 S.W. Bond Ave.
    Portland, OR 97239

    From the lobby or parking garage, take the elevators to the 3rd floor and follow the signs to the Conference Center. Directions available at http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/visiting/locations/chh.cfm


Talk descriptions:

"Getting Started with R" will cover:
    * Downloading and installing R from CRAN on Windows, Mac or Linux.
      Linux includes openSUSE, Ubuntu and Fedora.
    * Running a few demos.
    * The structure of CRAN.
    * Where the documentation is on an installed system.
    * The RSeek search engine.

Mr. Borasky will also have .ISO files of his R-based openSUSE appliance, which is at http://borasky-resear.... If you bring blank DVDs, copies can be burned for you.

help getting some flavor of Linux installed on this laptop, so I thought 
I would bow out of my usual commitment.  I'd like to provide as much 
notice as I can, but I can't find any info about when the next clinic 
is.  The website says 17 August, which was a Tuesday.

Hello all,

I have lots of live/install discs from the State Fair and am open to
something crazy like giving them away around the city as has been done
in other cities.

Might anyone want to join in? Other ideas?

it's the third sunday of each month, and yes, that includes this coming
sunday.

no notice is needed, just show up between 1 and 5 and wait for the next
available volunteer to help you out.

however, info about the laptop might be helpful to someone so we can look up
the particular challenges involved with installing linux on it, and perhaps
prepare to meet them.

I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has built a network source

rely upon online updates to speak directly to the client machine.

I have several systems that I have to recreate from scratch, and wish
to set up a source repository to assist that task, but I've never done
this before.

Your advice, experience, tips are welcome.  I would appreciate hearing
the pros/cons and pitfalls and advantages of this type of software
maintenance.

I have set this up for our systems here at work.  I setup one machine to
run cron daily as the repo sync process but have all the internal machine
point to the local repository.  Most have to do that since most of the internal
machines don't have internet access.

I use cron, wget or reposync depending on which site I pull files from.
After pulling files with wget I just use the createrepo program to turn
my directory into a repository and share everything via http.

A lot depends on the distribution(s) you're hoping to mirror. Without 
knowing that, any response I give would be tentative.

Another thing, that is somewhat related.  I have a bunch of lab
machines that people
use to test various pieces of software.  We also use a pxeboot install
process that
allows use to easily re-install a machine from scratch.  I'm using
Redhat/Centos/Oracle
distros and create a kickstart file for the various types of installs
that we do on a regular
basis.  This makes re-creating a system very quick and easy.

No, not really. I'm somewhat familiar with mirroring CentOS and 
Debian, which have fairly different requirements.

CentOS is mirrored mostly by version. That is, the primary choice you 
face is which version(s) you want to mirror (4? 5?). CentOS, like RHEL 
on which it's based, is a fairly compact distribution. Any given point 
release (e.g., 5.5) can be mirrored for installation and update 
purposes with about 20 GB of disk space. Bandwidth requirements are 
fairly minimal -- except when a new point release hits the mirrors.

Here's a compact version of my rsync script, which doesn't mirror the 
large ISO (CD, DVD) files or the smaller centosplus or extras 
repositories:

----- %< -----
VERS="5.5"
/usr/bin/rsync -avSH \
   --exclude "isos" --exclude "centosplus" --exclude "extras" \
   mirrors.cat.pdx.edu::centos/${VERS}/
   /srv/mirrors/centos/${VERS}/
----- %< -----

The primary choice with Debian, OTOH, is which platforms (i386, amd64, 
source, ...) you want to support. I use the ftpsync utility (which 
uses rsync under the hood) for Debian mirroring. You don't really It's 
hard to exclude a specific version, so you end up mirroring stable, 
testing, and experimental all at once. Our mirror for the i386 and 
amd64 platforms a little over 100 GB of disk space and the nightly 
bandwidth requirements are much larger than for CentOS.


Both Debian and CentOS I make available to local machines via HTTP 
(using lighttpd). Installations (using PXE) and updates (yum, apt) are 
quick. I can kickstart a CentOS 5 virtual machine in five to seven 
minutes, depending on the complexity of the installation. Debian takes 
a bit longer because it lacks a kickstart facility, but it's still a 
relatively quick process.

Thanks, Wes.  I should have been clearer:  I meant I want to provide the 
agency for which I volunteer with notice that I won't be coming in this 
Sunday, if that's when the Clinic is happening (in case they can find 
someone to pinch-hit for me).

The laptop is a Toshiba Satellite L505 with a 2.2GHz Intel Pentium Dual 
Core T4400 processor, 3GB RAM, a Realtek Wireless LAN NIC (which I think 
can be a problem).  I haven't spent as much time searching as I wanted 
to, but there seem to have been a lot of ACPI issues, which may have 
been solved (or partially solved) with a recent kernel.  I have found 
various problem reports and some suggested fixes for similar machines 
(in the L505 family) on Ubuntu and Arch Linux forums, but it's hard to 
get an accurate sense of the timing (i.e., does a problem and attendant 
fix that was reported six months ago still apply now?).

The exact model is L505-ES5018, as reviewed by CNET here:
http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/toshiba-satellite-l505-es5018/4505-3121_7-33970179.html#reviewPage1 


I needed a sub-$500 notebook really quickly (as in, buy at retail) -- 
AFAIK, it's just not possible to get a Linux notebook for that price in 
Portland, unless maybe you get really lucky at Free Geek.

i'd be happy to join in on something like this, and i'm also a big fan
of warbooting (rebooting demo models in retail shops to run from live
disc, then walking away), though there's not many companies that smile
on this practice. :)

Message-ID: <1284601631.4401.15.camel@nathan-laptop>

so i've been working on unifying our home network, getting everything
friendly and playing nicely together (no mean feat in a mixed OS
environment as i've come to learn). as a way of smoothing out bumps
caused by the fact that our main work/play computers are laptops, and
frequently travel with us to different locations, i decided that
mounting network shares in fstab wasn't optimal, as they're not present
when away from home. i did a bunch of research online and was surprised
to find a not-very-large number of pre-written answers to the problem. 

i've managed to piece one together myself (warnings, bash amateur), and
thought i'd share in case others have similar questions, and ask for
feedback on possible improvements/better methodologies; though it works
solidly, it feels kludgy to me, especially in the first few lines. 
thanks in advance for your time.

Subject: [PLUG] Using a new perl on CentOS...
Message-ID: <1284604766.3103.9.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

It goes without saying, Perl-5.8.8 is long in the tooth.  If you
download Perl 5 these days, the current version is 5.12.1 and
there is an upgrade via CPAN to 5.12.2.  Sadly, force uninstalling
Perl 5.8.8 via rpm -e --nodeps breaks vim and possibly other tools
in CentOS 5.5.  I did so anyways and installed from source Perl 5.12.1.
How do I actually make this work though?  I added 
/usr/lib/perl5/5.12.1/i686-linux-thread-multi-ld/CORE/
to /etc/ld.so.conf to get vim working again.

I'm wondering if important tools on CentOS are hard coded to expect Perl
5.8.8 or if worse a Perl 5.8.8 bug is important?

Net::EasyTCP doesn't work after replacing Perl 5.8.8.  SpamCannibal
doesn't work in the sense that dbtarpit exits prematurely, but that
may not be a Perl issue.  Strangely enough, MailFilter does work.
I'm on the SpamCannibal mailing list, but I don't think that anyone
is home there.

How does Perl handle finding it's libraries etcetera?  Do I need to
add anything else to /etc/ld.so.conf to get things working?

Anyone know why I'm getting the following:

Leave the system Perl alone ( /usr/bin/perl ).  Especially the
redhat version, they messed it up to match their expectations.
Let rpm upgrades take care of any "improvements" added by
redhat to that, but otherwise keep the cotton-pickin hands off,
or Wierd Things Will Happen.

For everything else, install the Perl of your dreams in
/usr/local/bin/perl , and modify any scripts that are hardcoded
to /usr/bin/perl that you want to use it.  Since binaries in
/usr/local/bin are used in preference to /usr/bin , many scripts
will use the local version.

Besides keeping all the redhat perl scripts working, this also
leaves you with a version of perl on the system that may be bent
but is unlikely to get broken.

If you ever end up using a VPN or other nonstandard interface, using 
the route utility to identify your gateway might be problematic since 
it'll return more than one value.

The ip utility, however, will reliably show your default route without 
relying on grep:

   /sbin/ip route show 0.0.0.0/0 | awk '{print $3}'

> mactest=`arp -a | grep -i "$gateway)" | grep -i -o '[0-9A-F]\{2
> \}\(:[0-9A-F]\{2\}\)\{5\}'`

Again, the ip utility will handle this with a little more aplomb:

   /sbin/ip neighbor show $gateway | awk '{print $5}'

> targetmac="XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"

In fact, I suspect you could do away with asking for the default route 
entirely and instead just ask if your target MAC is reachable:

   MAC=$(ip neighbor show | grep 'XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX REACHABLE' | wc -l)

   if [ "$MAC" -eq 1 ]; then
     ...
   fi

> upcommand="mount home-net:/media/disk /media/net"
> downcommand="umount home-net:/media/disk"

You can still have these entries in /etc/fstab, just use the "noauto" 
option to keep it from mounting at boot time:

   home-net:/media/disk  /media/net  nfs  hard,intr,rw,noauto  0 0

Then you can replace $upcommand with a simple "mount /media/net" and 
$downcommand with "umount /media/net".

So, assuming you added my suggested /etc/fstab entry, my short version 
of your script would be

#!/bin/sh
MAC=$(ip neighbor show | grep 'XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX REACHABLE' | wc -l)
if [ "$MAC" -eq 1 ]; then
   case "$2" in
     up)
       mount /media/net
       ;;
     down)
       umount /media/net
       ;;
     esac
fi

thanks a bunch for your feedback, the ip utility certainly seems a

A few problems with this.

1. SpamCannibal and EasyTCP require perl, not python.

2. The Slackware 10.1 based server is running perl 5.12.1 just fine.

3. Obviously, CentOS's perl 5.8.8 doesn't match.

4. I've already installed perl 5.12.1 as the default on CentOS.

5. I did an rpm -e --nodeps for all of the CentOS perl packages and 
   then I deleted /usr/lib/perl5 prior to source installation.

Thing is, there has to be a way to do this and if there isn't, there
should be an explanation why.  When perl 6 is finished, will people
still prefer python?  I don't understand why people want 
to leave perl for python.  If Redhat has done something strange to
perl, what did Redhat do?  Can I duplicate this with the newer source
code to be compatible with CentOS 5.x perl and perl 5.12.1 on the
slackware based server?  The slackware server is nfs root based, so
please don't suggest that I upgrade.

I'm tempted to install perl 5.8.8 via yum on CentOS, but this won't
match what I have on the Slackware server and it is older.  Is there
a way to install the standard perl to a non standard area to study 
it somehow so I can figure out what RedHat did to it?

EasyTCP isn't working on the CentOS server with perl 5.12.1, I get a
lot of unintialized value errors and I don't know why.  Isn't perl
capable of emulating older versions of itself?

Yes, interfaces change and things break.  RHEL5/Centos5 is at the end
of the major update period.
We will probably get one more with major fixes that are not security
related after RHEL6 comes out
at the end of the year.

Depends.  I find python is easier to read.

The tarball for the 5.12.1 and the source rpm. stick the two together
and start building.
Oh, btw, start figuring out what all the patch files do as these were
probably pushed up stream
but you don't know until you look at each one.

The reason for using a distro like Centos is similar to/and why people
use Redhat is for stability.
Moving perl to something that breaks existing working programs is not
in the cards.
Centos follows the exact same packages.

The idea of leaving the base perl and building/installing the newer
version is very reasonable as
it won't break things that worked before like vim (and others).  If
you need 5.12.1 for EasyTCP
then place in /usr/local/{bin,lib} as needed and change the few places
in EasyTCP to point to
the new version of perl.

If you really want to do things like replace a major language that has
dependencies in dozens of packages.
Go for it.  Be prepared for a lot of bumps on the way.  Do it on a
machine you don't care about as when
you get it to the point that none of the major programs that use perl
work, re-install from scratch and start over
learning from your mistakes.   That the beauty of of Open Source, you
are free to do what you want with it.

Grab the source rpm files from

Ask the author.  If you ask a question in the right way, with enough
detail. You will
probably get a useful answer.

Nice jab at Perl.  Trying to upgrade Python from 2.4 to 2.5 or 2.6 on a Distro
like Centos 5 is really painful.  Not really worth the effort to do a
full replacement.

Probably a stupid question, but if one wanted to find all files with
execute bits set in a folder (find . -executable), and then execute
them, all within a bash script, is there a simple "for files in *"
loop that would accomplish this?

Here, let me Google that for you.
http://www.google.com/search?q=wap11+ntp
First answer is a page entitled, "Weird dates and time stamps on old
Linksys WAP11..." which is someone asking much the same question as you,
but in 2006 on WirelessForums, which would be a great place to find people
who know something about WAPs.  So this answer has been sitting on the web,
waiting for you, for 4 years.

The first response to the question confirms that Linksys hard-coded the NTP
servers.  A later response includes the actual source code with the addresses.

I didn't see an answer to that.  I suspect not, unless you replace the
firmware.  Surprisingly enough, googling for "wap11 firmware" gave me
links to firmware for the device, and in fact, the first result was a page
about loading a (far superior) D-Link firmware onto the WAP11, as well as
increasing output power.

It's truly amazing what a web-search can tell you.

Are you sure that's a jab at Perl? I read it as saying that when
upgrading Python you can run into the same headaches/problems as when
trying to upgrade Perl. So just another bit of anecdotal evidence that
you need to be careful when trying to change the defaults that a
system ships with.

Some are misunderstanding Pat.  He did not mean replacing system
Perl with system Python.  He endorsed my suggestion regards Perl.

His suggestion was to s/Perl/Python/ to my message and treat Python
the same way.  That is, leave /usr/bin/python alone and make upgrades
to /usr/local/bin/python .  A wise extension of a basic philosophy -
let updates manage the distro, make improvements to /usr/local .

While a dependency-free distro would be a nice dream (why oh why
can't dependencies be managed per individual tool, not whole
systems?), in reality a change to one tool affects many others. 
I run distros, rather than roll my own, because I'm relying on
The Upstream Vendor to do the regression testing for me.

I suspect there are other tools in the distro that should be left
alone, with upgrades going into /usr/local/bin instead.  Perhaps
the C compiler.  Other suggestions?

At the risk of being misunderstood, again, I can confirm that it was not a
jab at Perl.
In fact, I was warning that similar cautions and solutions apply to Python
as those described by Keith for Perl.

I do that when I set up a net-install system.  Usually, I set up a basic
install dir using an install CD, and then make a cache of remote network
repos using Squid, apt-cacher-ng or something similar.

I highly recommend caching package repos.

Sorry for confusing the issue.

I know that on RHEL/Centos most of the automation/admin tools are written in
python and replacing/upgrading it with a new version is really a bad
idea unless
you want to go back to editing files with ed.

Subject: [PLUG] Array Variables in KSH
Message-ID: <4C938444.9070808@cooper.stevenson.name>

Hi All,

This seemingly simple question has had me perplexed since last night. I
want to index an array by a loop counter variable, for example:

  for (( column=1; column < ( num_of_iterations + 1); column++ ))
  {
      min_value[i]=$(code creating min_value)
      print "column_min: " ${min_value[i]}
  }

Easy enough. The print statement works and everything's fine.

However, if I say:

  print "column_min: " ${min_value[2]}

The variable is empty!

Even worse, as soon as I drop out of the 'for' loop, KSH seems to forget
the variable even existed. For example, just outside of the braketed
code above, suppose I wrote:

  for (( x=1; x < ( num_of_iterations + 1 ); x++ ))
  {
         print ${min_value[x]}
  }

KSH has no idea what I'm talking about; it's as if $min_value[] has
simply vanished.

How can I create arrayed KSH variables that "stick?"


Very Best,

A question, if I may ... in the first snip ... where does the index 
variable 'i' come from and how is it incremented?

Basic answer -- you can mirror just about any public repo with rsync.
apt-mirror is an excellent tool for said purpose.

If you do any custom repo, you'll need to rebuild the package database.
the yum-arch or dpkg-scanpackages command can be helpful there. Both
collect package headers. You can even apply such commands to packages
downloaded on a single system, such as those in the /var/cache directory
tree. 

Some distros have their own tools for custom repos and mirrors -- I
think the Red Hat Proxy (and Satellite) servers costs a bit of money.
Someone mentioned Cobbler, which I think is a free option.

SUSE has Zenworks.

Both SUSE and Red Hat have front-ends that allow update management from
a custom repo. I gather that SUSE Zenworks can also be used for Windoze
updates. I think Spacewalk is an open source option to Red Hat Network,
but haven't tried it.  

On the Ubuntu side, I don't know if Landscape can be pointed to custom
mirrors either.

Thanks,
Mike

Thank you Fred. Your insightful question solves it...I should have written:

  min_value[column]=$(code creating min_value)

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=nviB=Rp+RtoqNQEUoHvuoebo7hnrW7sH=XYQk@mail.gmail.com>

I have a hacked D-Link DGL-4300 gaming router free to anyone who wants
to experiment with the Ubicom IP3023 chipset on this router.

The router still talks to the internet, but drops out of WPA et all
secure mode into all clear mode without warning on the wireless side.

Was expensive router, 1 Gig ports, etc, but apparently too
irresistable a target.

Yours for free, if you like.

Message-ID: <1285030019.2111.5.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

How do I get perl-5.12.1 to uninstall spamassassin 3.3.1 and it's 
broken dependencies which I installed via CPAN?

I'm installing perl-5.8.9 from source under /usr/local and hoping 
that I can run spamassassin and Net::EasyTCP using that instead.

Another question I have, can I add a dynamically linkable copy 
of Perl-5.12.1 after the fact?  I'd rather not undo all my CPAN 
work where I'd really like to get vim back as vi isn't so great.

Has anyone gotten spamassassin or Net::EasyTCP to work with 
Perl-5.12.1?

Message-ID: <1285092800.3722.7.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I found a tool called checkinstall that can create an rpm from a source
tarball.  Trouble is when I am creating a Perl rpm from source tarball,
how do I make certain that it will be recognized as fulfilling the 
dependencies that CentOS's Perl rpm does?

So far I haven't been able using cpan2rpm and checkinstall to create
rpms for Perl and all Perl related modules, but I have a few.

You can't.

The CPAN installer is not a packager.  It's just a downloader, builder,
and installer, with a dependency mechanism built-in.

You're... out of luck.

No, but I tried it. I do a little home music recording. Audacity in the

Kirk,

   Have you tried 'cp file.ext <printer_name>'?

   I assume that you have (or will have) CUPS set up so it 1) knows there's a
printer somewhere and 2) how to communicate with it.

Hi Kirk,

Get a load of this (link this script in your /etc/init.d/ directory):

------------------------------------ Begin Script
---------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

#initialization variables
myprinter=/dev/lp0
logo_file=/usr/local/doc/my_logo.ext

#print logo to printer
lpr -P$myprinter $logo_file
-------------------------------------- End Script
----------------------------------------


You can do fancy things like dynamically assign the printer name by
scanning the 'dmesg' startup log. If you had different models of thin
clients, for example, this might come in handy.

I've written this script "fuzzily," i.e. the precise commands need to be
checked and tested. This should give you a pretty good guide though.


Very Best,


D. Cooper Stevenson

I have used (and still do use) Kino and its actually a pretty decent
program.  Learning the proper way to cut, splice and edit is slightly
different but once one gets it then its a snap.  Solid enough to keep me

+1 for Kino.  I postprocessed all my bike videos with it.  Of course,
since I've never used any other video editor, I have no idea how it
compares with other stuff.  But for a clueless, permanent noob like me,
it worked out great.

    sudo cp <filespec> /dev/parport0
   
Assuming your system has one parallel port.
You can set up the sudoers to allow this command without a password challenge.

Subject: [PLUG] nginx serving out http Ubuntu local archive pages questions
Message-ID: <4C9B9846.5090608@gmail.com>

  Is anyone using nginx to serve out a distribution archive?  While I 
have nginx running and can see the root page, I cannot seem to get the 
ubuntu (debian derivative) archive pages to display.  I want to use 
nginx to be the local repository for a LAN group under http for apt-get

If you are running nginx and a debian or ubuntu local archive, please 
let me know how to configure for a local server.  My server obtains a 
dhcp IP from the cable modem, into the local group 192.168.1.xxx, but I 
don't know ahead of time what that IP will be.

I was trying to use the local 127.0.1.1  or 127.0.0.1 IPs  but for some 
reason I still cannot see the pages from the http browser although 
recycling nginx indicates that it is happy with the config files.

That number is just under 4G of course, but the rest is probably
stolen by your video card.  If you want more of that back, check bios
settings.  However, setting it too low could cause you video problems.
Anyway, it sounds like it's probably seeing all of the RAM.

Anyone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on any of this.

Looks right. You can always check make menuconfig and the kernel opts though.

Message-ID: <4C9DE62D.2060902@gmail.com>

I've been having lots of issues with a XFS partition I use to host my
mythtv files.

I've done the umount,mount,xfs_check, xfs_repair -L routine, several
times over the last couple of days

Yesterday I lost most of the media files on that partition.  I've
finally capture an error message of interest.

Filesystem "dm-5": XFS internal error xfs_alloc_read_agf at line 2293 of
file /build/buildd/linux-2.6.32/fs/xfs/xfs_alloc.c.

I tried googling it but without any luck.

Any other ideas where to go from here?

Subject: [PLUG] Video cards...
Message-ID: <1285477420.12805.15.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm in a tight spot.  I want and need a better video card than a Radeon
7500, but I have been burned twice trying to get one.  My first attempt
was an ATI Radeon HD 3450.  This card seems to work okay on one system
with linux from scratch, but it doesn't work on my Intel D845PEBT2
motherboard with Linux from scratch.  I've also had problems with this
video card randomly dropping signal under Fedora 12.  The obvious thing
to do, try and get a different video card.  I acquired an NVIDIA 6200
AGP 4x card.  Big mistake, text mode not supported at all and there are
compatibility issues with the open source nouveau driver.  I do not want
another video card that requires proprietary drivers.

I'm currently looking at a Radeon HD 2600 PRO card with dual HDMI ports.
Nice, I could run two high end monitors with this card.  Question is,
does this card even work under Linux from Scratch let alone Fedora 12
without a proprietary driver?

It has to be an AGP card and it has to be a 4x card or an 8x/4x card.

If I'm at a point where I need PCI express meaning a new motherboard,
what should I buy?  What should I avoid?

I'm currently in a situation where I have to open my case and substitute
my Radeon 7500 card to network boot Linux From Scratch and back things
up.  This is not ideal to say the least.  The stability issue where I
randomly lose signal with the Radeon HD 3450 is totally unacceptable.
The NVIDIA card not supporting text mode is just annoying.

Is there anyone other than AMD and NVIDIA in the video card business
supporting Linux better via open source, free, fully featured drivers?
Anyone who produces video cards that doesn't release the specs to the
open source community is making a major mistake in my opinion.  I don't
even have Windows on my personal computer anymore.

I'm not familiar with that particular CMS, but the driver would go 
somewhere that Apache can find it.  The css would need to go where the 
CMS can find it.  Is there a search path configuration for 
CMSmadesimple?  Have you considered Drupal instead, very easy to install 
and supports PostgreSQL out of the box.

Michael,

   First, I don't need that ancient pair of files; I need to re-complile PHP
with postgres support.

   Second, I was going to use drupal but it's inappropriate for our needs.
That is a good tool for sites heavy on user contributions, frequent changes
(e.g., news, shopping), and with hundreds to thousands of pages. It's not
the right CMS for a professional services firm whose Web site is essentially
a digital brochure.

Thanks,

Rich

Might I suggest Wordpress for that sort of site?  It is easy to install
and upgrade, I've found, from what fooling around I have done with that.

I have Wordpress on my desktop (!) running behind my firewall box under
Mandriva, which seems to have a good LAMP stack (hey, I got it working).

There are lots of free themes and I have been running vanilla Wordpress
for about 18 months without getting hacked, though I've seen many tries.

Just a thought,
Robert

Hi

I need a translation in ordinary language.  I tried to open newsletter and
received the following error message

Download Error
/tmp/09Sept-Oct-2010_MMMnews.pdf could not be opened, because the
associated helper application does not exist. Change the association in
your preference.


The last newsletter I received from this group was before my upgrade to
lucid and I did not have any problems opening it with my default document
viewer at that time.

Sooooooooo what do I need to do?


Thanks
Debra

PS when I got home and continued my system update, it just continued on
from where I stopped it at the end of the Linux Clinic last Sunday.  It
only took about another 1/2 hour.

What did you do before you got this message? Did you double-click on
the file in your file browser (Nautilus)? Or did you tell Firefox to
download and open the file? Or something else?

Debra,

   You apparently lost the connection between the document type and the
application (xpdf, acroread, whatever) that allows you to read it. You can
either reset that connection or download pdf files then read them.

   I know the apache Web site has a gazillion pages of information. While
I've been using httpd for quite a few years, it has been with only
superficial understanding.

   For example, this morning I tried logging in to my business accounting
application, Ledger123, and saw an Atlanta error:

Not Found

The requested URL /sql-ledger/login.pl was not found on this server.

despite localhost/sql-leger/login.pl being the address I've used for years.
I am without clue where to look for the source of this error so I can fix
it.

   /etc/httpd/httpd.conf and /etc/httpd/sql-ledger-httpd.conf have not
changed since I last accessed it.

   What's a good introduction that will allow me a better understanding of
what's going on behind the browser? I've a couple of other web apps (and I
can access them locally) and knowing more about the whole process will make
me a more comfortable admin. The appache.org http project documentation page
for version 2.2 has a bunch of links. Where should I start?

TIA,

Rich

Temporarily bumping the LogLevel up to "debug" is always a great 
start:

   http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#loglevel

I'll emphasize the "temporarily": debug-level logs are large and full 
of details you may not want leaked.

   Thank you, Paul. I'll do that to work on the lack of access.

   What I meant, and I see it's not clear as I thought, was where should I
start learning more about http and web apps from the apache.org site. Or,
some other place.

Note that the error references "/srv/httpd...", not "/var/httpd..." 
I've moved most of my web content to the /srv filesystem, but the 
default Apache configuration for most distributions still put the 
DocumentRoot in /var.

So, do your backups have a /srv/httpd filesystem?

Paul,

   I've seen that, and seen a translation somewhere between /srv/ and
var/www/. I don't recall off-hand where that is.

> So, do your backups have a /srv/httpd filesystem?

   No. They reflect the file system directories.

   Again, the only explicit change I've made in the past week or so is
removing /etc/apache/ since that's been deprecated.

Thanks,

Rich

Paul,

   First, in /etc/httpd/httpd.conf the DocumentRoot is set to
"/srv/httpd/htdocs" and the server gets very upset if I change that to
"/var/www/httpd/htdocs" because it cannot find /var/www. Strange. But, it
works. Which illustrates that I need to learn more about what goes on behind
the curtain of httpd.

   Second, I found the error in L123 not working. There must have been an
alias in /etc/apache/ that directed httpd to look in /usr/local/sql-ledger/
rather than the document root for those files, and that alias was not in
/etc/httpd/. It was commented out in /etc/httpd/sql-ledger-httpd.conf for
all these years. Uncommenting it fixed the problem.

Thanks very much,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] what simple linux command does this?
Message-ID: <4CA3CE02.5030507@gmail.com>

  This is a "noobie" linux question.

I cannot seem to find a simple linux command to do the following:

mv /one/long/path/on/a/partition/file 
/another/path/on/another/partition/file

i.e. simply move a file around across directories and partitions.  The 
names and paths are not necessarily the same.

I have been reading the internet and read scores of comments like "use 
rsync" (nope, not preserving paths) "use cp -R/r" (nope, not copying 
recursively, just one file).  Both mv and cp refuse to create new 
directories or directory paths (unless recursive and we're not doing a 
recursive copy)

So far all that I have been able to do is

mkdir /another
cd another
mkdir path
cd path
mkdir on
cd on
mkdir another
cd another
mkdir partition
cd partition
cp /one/long/path/on/a/partition/file .

I think you get the idea.

Isn't there an easy way to do this?

How about:

$ mkdir -p /another/path/on/another/partition/
$ mv /one/long/path/on/a/partition/file /another/path/on/another/partition/

I'm more of a fan of:
$ mkdir -p /another/path/on/another/partition/ && mv /one/long/path/on/a/partition/file !!$

The && just to be sure you're only doing it if the mkdir works
the !!$ to lessen my propensity for typos.

See `man bash` for History Expansion for the !!$ magic

Which, by the way, is incorrect.


either 
    $ mkdir -p /another/path/on/another/partition/ && mv /one/long/path/on/a/partition/file /another/path/on/another/partition/
or 
    $ mkdir -p /another/path/on/another/partition/
    $ mv /one/long/path/on/a/partition/file !!$

In all cases we keep ending up with at least 2 commands (I don't count 
conjoined & commands as one command)

So there really isn't one single command, is there?

This is what I was afraid of.

I am looking at the source code of cp now.

I don't believe there is, but I think it's an easy script to write.
Something like this should do:

--Rogan

#!/bin/bash
#
#   this has only been *very* minimally tested:

SRC_DIR=`dirname "$1"`
DEST_ROOT="$2"
DEST="$DEST_ROOT/$SRC_DIR"
SRC_FILE="$1"

mkdir -p "$DEST"
cp "$SRC_FILE" "$DEST"

You are wanting to do two things:
   make a new directory
   copy something into it

Why should there be a single command for it?

Actually I was looking at this from a C++ point of view.  You have a 
simple file.open() command for source and destination. This command 
includes the path + filename.

I already have written a c++ program which does what I want, so this 
thread is now closed.

  To all:

Thanks for your suggestions, I went ahead and looked at the cp source 
code and some C++ programming references and created a copy command 
which does have the full path in both the source and destination files.

The tricky part is getting a suitable size read buffer, particularly 
when the file size > 10 megs.

In looking at the full list from three different major on-line retailers and
a couple of local places.  All I find is variations of ATI and nVidia for
AGP.  Similar in the PCI-E cards.   The only other vendor of video is
Intel and they only make it for their own boards.

We got new hardware at work about two years ago that had Radeon HD
2400 XT cards.
The basic driver for all distros worked well enough for us doing
development but we
needed to configure it for dual monitors.  The basic driver didn't
work for dual head.
There was several ways it got solved.

1) proprietary driver
2) rebuilding X with the latest and greatest.
3) Using a distro that had a version of X that supported the card.

The person that rebuilt X used Gentoo.
The others were a mix of Centos and Fedora 10+.

I'm not sure if anyone has explained yet that these !-variables have to 
do with bash's history. I read this article recently on bash history and 
found it to be quite good:

http://symkat.com/90/understanding-bash-history/

You can do some pretty cool stuff with your bash history.

Enjoy,

Scott
