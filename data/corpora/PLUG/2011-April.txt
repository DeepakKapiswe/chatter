To shortcut to the end of a very long and annoying story, I gave up
getting the WRT54G set up as an access point and ordered a D-Link
DWL-2100AP access point. The D-Link arrove yesterday, but I was not
able to get an IP address from it either. Upstream is a D-Link DGL-4100
router.

Since both devices are D-Link, and relatively recent, this morning I
called D-Link technical support. Very nice, albeit ineffective people.
I spent an hour and a half on the phone with them, including the last
45 minutes with an upper level tech guy. At the end they concluded that
there must be an incompatibility between the router and the access
point. I found that difficult to believe since they had no reports of
this in their knowledgebase. I can't believe I'm the first one to
discover the problem.

However, while poking at things the second level tech support guy had
me check the router to see if MAC address checking was enabled. It was,
and he told me that it is not supposed to be enabled by default, so I
turned it off. It didn't resolve the problem.

After telling me I should return the DWL-2100AP we ended the
support call. Then I decided to try the Linksys again, in the hopes
that perhaps having turned off MAC address checking in the D-Link
router it might now work. 

IT DOES! The phone happily asks for the WPA password I set, then
connects, and is able to buzz out all over the internet. My laptop also
connects without a problem.

So I am keeping the WRT54G, and I have placed the DWL-2100AP in my
Clinic box for further poking on the 17th.

   System is Dell Latitude E-5410 running a brand-new installation of
Slackware-13.1/64-bit. I replaced the 2G RAM with 8G (two 4G DIMMs), yet
/proc/meminfo shows only 3.9G (close enough to 4G) installed. What might be

Dan,

   My "improved" do they mean the kernel sees only half? :-) The system is
running the 64-bit version of the OS. 'uname -a' shows x86_amd as the OS
flavor.

Thanks,

Unfortunately, the bios installer is all Windows based. I could loan you a 80gb laptop drive to restore the original OS, do the upgrade and then swap your linux drive back in. Assuming the system uses sata drives.

   My Google search shows me there are some tools for RHEL, Debian, and
Ubuntu. I've no idea how to bend the process to work with Slackware.

Russell,

   The company has a community-supported linux group. I can sign up there and
see what help might be available.

   I have a SATA-USB external drive adapter. Could the upgrade be done
somehow connecting your drive via USB? I could download the .exe (or
whatever they use) onto a separate thumb drive.

   If this might work I'll be happy to bring laptop, adapter, and me to
anywhere convenient for you.

Thanks,

Rich

Unofficially, I was talking to David this evening and we decided that
we'd "relocate" the PLUG meeting to the RMS talk this month, since it
neatly coincides pretty much with our regular meeting time.  The
decision was assisted by the fact that David was lacking of a speaker
this month.  Stand by for the official announcement for confirmation.

As Paul Heinlein told us a month ago, check for "pae" with
/proc/cpuinfo, as well as /boot/config-2.6.[whatever] for
CONFIG_X86_PAE.  There are probably other associated options
that must also be configured.  I assume you have tried booting
into MEMTST, and looked through dmesg for clues, and looked in
the CMOS BIOS setup for clues, and updated the BIOS if needed.

Lastly, make sure both DIMMs work properly and are properly
seated in their sockets, perhaps testing each one by itself
with MEMTST, and testing both sockets with just one DIMM.
You can also try mixing one new and one old DIMM.  Lots of
experiments to try, and a fuller picture might lead you to
the cause.

Keith,

   Apparently, that's what's needed. For whatever the reason, Dell did not
make their BIOS version A03 accept > 4G RAM despite being on an Intel i7
chipset/CPU that runs at high speed.

   What's worse, in my opinion, is that after 20 years of linux in the world
(and many businesses running this OS), Dell does not have an inherent means
of upgrading the BIOS unless the system is running Microsoft. Of course, HP
had the same crappy customer support attitude on printer firmware upgrades.
It's a shame that Microsoft can still bend these companies over as they do.

   I'm seeking a means of upgrading the BIOS version, perhaps with an
external hard drive.

Dear Rich, 

While I haven't tried it personally, I gather some others have upgraded
Dell BIOSes with DOS and BartPE-based tools. (BartPE, IIRC, is a
bootable version of XP; but it requires at least an XP installation CD
for verification). Perhaps such media came with your Dell?

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

   Nope. Nothing but what was on the hard drive.

   FWIW, Dell will ship the E5410 with Ubuntu rather than Windoze, but you
still cannot upgrade the BIOS with their factory installation of Ubuntu.
Wonder how they explain that.

   I've been offered a hard drive with Win on it. I don't know if it can boot
from an external connection or whether I need to take off the bottom cover,
dig out the hard drive, swap them, then figure out how to upgrade the BIOS,
and return the system the way it was.

Russell, Mike, Dan, et al.:

   While the laptop is upgrading everything to Slackware-current (the
soon-to-be-released 13.37) and it's raining so I have an excuse to put off
the yard work and gutter cleaning, I've dug more deeply into Dell's hidden
OSS world.

   For the record, they have this site
          <http://linux.dell.com/wiki/index.php/Repository/firmware>

explicitly to "... provide a mechanism which can be used to update the BIOS
and other firmware on our systems. We used the mkbiosrepo.sh script in the
dell-repo-tools package to build a repository of all the BIOS and firmware
images available on http://support.dell.com (only the latest version for
each system is in the repository). Now our systems' BIOS and firmware stays
up to date automatically by the same method our operating system software
stays up to date."

    They go on to write, "This [sic] *only* support for firmware updates that
you get from this site is via the mailing list. If you call Dell phone
support, it is unlikely that they will even know this exists, and under no
circumstances would they be able to fix any problems with it. On the other
hand, the developers of this software are on the mailing list, and will
likely be able to look at and fix your problem."

   So, here goes my weekend.

Subject: [PLUG] Buying laptop?  Buy another hard drive
Message-ID: <20110402203523.GA26746@gate.kl-ic.com>

When you buy a laptop that comes pre-installed with Windoze, buy
the version with the cheapest hard drive they offer.  Then buy
another large hard drive,  preferably two identical large hard
drives, from another trusted vendor.  Then install Linux from
scratch on both of those.  Why?

You may need that Windoze hard drive for warranty service.  You
may also need it to upgrade the BIOS.  Manufacturers typically
charge more per GB for hard drives than Newegg or Fry's, so 
you can save money buying it yourself.  And if you ever want
to sell the laptop, you will probably find more buyers (sadly)
if the machine is running Windoze.

Lastly, if you ever want to do bit copy image backup, it is
somewhat helpful if the backup target is identical to the
backup source.  You are less likely to find a hard drive to
the drives the manufacturer buys.  So, buy two hard drives!
Hard drives are so damned inexpensive these days, having
spares is cheap insurance.  

Yes, it is nice to make a copy of Windoze go away by installing
Linux over the top of it, but Redmond has an inexhaustable 
supply, and they will count your machine as a Windoze machine
no matter what you do after they've sold it.  If you want to 
make Windoze really go away, help spread Linux.

The above does not apply to laptops preinstalled with Linux,
of course.

Keith,

   Dell has a linux group pretty well hidden in the company, but they have a
linux based firmware tool kit. Currently only the BIOS is upgradable, but
they expect other firmware to join the parade. The idea is to upgrade
firmware as can be done with distribution software using yum, apt, slackpkg,
and others.

   Now, only .rpm packages are available (perhaps the .deb packages are
there, too). I've just joined the firmware developers' mail list and
volunteered to port the process to Slackware. I'll get help in writing the
SlackBuild script from the slackbuild.org folks.

   I don't know about you and others, but by the time I decide to replace my
portable machine it has no resale value regardless of what OS is installed.
:-)

I still have a couple of Win98 programs that I use from time to time. 
I'd like to be able to run them on a virtual machine on my Linux 
machine. To that end I installed the .deb package for VirtualBox from 
Oracle, and successfully created a virtual Win98 machine. The base 
machine only supports 16 colors at 640 x 480. To get better resolution 
and take advantage of some optimization one must next implement "Guest 
Additions." Unfortunately, support is not provided for Win98 (or 95 or 
ME). Two alternatives are mentioned (that I've found through Google). 
One is a commercial product for about $40. The other is free, but I 
don't find clear instructions on how to use it.

http://bearwindows.boot-land.net/vbe9x.htm

Is anyone on the list using VirtualBox to run Win98? And can you point 
me to clearer instructions on how to use the vbemp drivers?

Thanks.

Is there a reason you couldn't use a virtual Win2000 instead, it is possible
there is support for Win2000 guest additions (I'm not sure).
I know it is more likely Win98 programs will run in Win2000 than the other
later versions.

The LSI SAS 3081E-R, just in JBOD mode, and yes: I loaded the latest
version a few days ago as part of working on solving this all; it
still hits the same notes occasionally.

OK, cool.  The firmware update didn't solve the problem, but I am
overdue for a kernel upgrade on that machine anyway, so I will see if
that resolves things for me.  It is a 3gb (well, 3/6 now, with 3gb
SATA disks) and all.

The other possibility is that one of the disks really is failing a
bit; they did get shipped across the world and all, and at least one
got beat enough to fail shortly afterwards.

You really do want to get the newer drivers in place as there is an
issue running
smartctl through that driver to SATA devices.  The new driver fixes the problem.
modinfo /path_to/mptsas.ko

modinfo mptsas.ko
filename:       mptsas.ko

Note that the in-kernel drivers may not be up to the latest from the vendor.

Ken,

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1104031303480.9469@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   There is a SlackBuild script for the libsmbios library, and one subscriber
to the mail list said that with the data files available at linux.dell.com
he's successfully upgraded the BIOS on his Latitude Dnnn several times.
Ergo, it will work for me, too, once I read all the documents and understand
what I'm doing.

   So, Dell provides the ability to flash their BIOS firmware from linux
using .rpm, .deb (if I recall correctly) and .tgz (Slackware). Isn't that a
plus!

   Others here with Dell systems may find this useful. There are only a few
server, desktop, and portable models that cannot be upgraded this way.

   I let everyone know when I've completed the process.

   My development version of CMS Made Simple is in /var/www/htdocs/cmsms.
When I try to access it firefox displays a 'page not found' error.
/var/log/httpd/error_log has nothing more:

127.0.0.1 - - [04/Apr/2011:09:53:57 -0700] "GET /cmsms/index.php HTTP/1.1"
404 195

   The software suite includes httpd-2.2.17, php-5.2.17 (recompiled to
support postgres rather than mysql), postgresql-9.0.3, and
cms-made-simple-1.8.2.

   In /var/www/htdocs/ is an executable info.php that calls <?php phpinfo();
?>. But, running this results in an error:
./info.php: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token ('
./info.php: line 1: <?php phpinfo(); ?>'

   Where do I start looking for the source of this error? Seems strange to me
that phpinfo() won't run.

Cut 'em a little slack. <oh god, bad pun not intended, i swear>

Dell is miles ahead of most vendors by offering Linux firmware upgrade
tools at all, even if they're unsupported. I'd bet that it is
troublesome to get new platforms for BIOS flashing validated/approved,
as there's a high potential for bricking your customer's device. Not
to mention the variety of distros to track. I'm sure Slackware does
not make the cut when figuring out what OSs to pay attention to.
"Slack-what?" The margins that consumer laptops operate at demand that
they pay no attention to you.

HP has bootable CDs (and you can construct bootable USB images, with a
Windows tool, of course) that will update BIOS, BMC, storage
controllers, at least for the DL series. That's a reasonable approach
for a vendor, IMHO.

   Mea culpa! It does work when I use firefox to run info.php. But, I'm still
not able to access cmsmadesimple. Sigh.

I'm looking for a good Dell LT, but when I asked them for a no o/s or Linux
they wouldn't sell me one. If fact, the sales 'droid I talked to said they only
sell them with Windows so they could "...be sure it's working right."

Is there secret phone number that would connect me to their skunk works so
I can get a laptop with Linux on it? Seems that the Windows sales reps
there don't know about Linux, and claimed it didn't exist.

But I might just try Keith's idea, too.

Fuzzy memory, but do you link to cmsmadesimple from a page that works? 
Or do you try to load it directly into Firefox? I seem to recall that it 
doesn't work to do directly access a local php file. I have to load 
through an index.php file. At least I think that's what I do. Like I 
said, the memory on this is fuzzy.

Based on what you've written,
There must be a definition in your Apache config listing /var/www/htdocs/ as the DocumentRoot for the server
(if you have virtual servers defined then you must be accessing the specific one)
and if so 
/var/www/htdocs/cmsms/index.php must exist.

Since you say "development version" perhaps the Document root is /var/www/htdocs/cmsms/
therefore you specifying "http://somehostname<maybe_the_rest_of_FQDN>/cmsms/<with_or_without_index.php>
goes a level too deep in the directory structure.

Dick,

   I was trying to access http://localhost/cmsms/index.php.

Michael,

   It does:

/var/www/htdocs/cmsms/index.php

> Since you say "development version" perhaps the Document root is

> "http://somehostname<maybe_the_rest_of_FQDN>/cmsms/<with_or_without_index.php>

   By 'development version' I mean it's local and not accessible by the
outside world. With this URL: http://localhost/cmsms/index.php I see:

Not Found
The requested URL was not found on this server.

   Wait ... I just restarted httpd and not I see a blank page rather than the
"Not Found".

   When I access http://localhost/sql-ledger/login.pl it works. Both have
/var/www/htdocs/ as the root directory. I see nothing explicitly mentioning
cmsms in /etc/httpd/httpd.conf. Last October, when I first set this up it
worked.

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] Do I have the wrong Java for Desire 2 Learn?
Message-ID: <20110404202250.401cba87@mailhost.pdx.edu>

The professor has put numerous articles and papers on Desire 2 Learn. I
can download almost all of them just by clicking on them in Firefox
3.6.16 on Fedora 14 x86_64. Sometimes, however, the download does not
happen. But then later I can click on the same java link and it does
download. Today there is a new PDF file that I need before class
tomorrow, and I can't get it to download at all. I could e-mail the
professor and she will send it to me directly, but a better solution
would be to resolve the problem.

I have also never been able to configure Firefox to open PDFs in a
browser tab. I don't really care; downloading and opening directly
is fine. But maybe if I could get that working it would be a
workaround. I have read countless pages about how to get Firefox to
open PDFs in a tab, but almost all are hopelessly out of date, and none
have ever worked for me.

I have also tried Opera, but it doesn't work either.

Note that the link on the page is javascript, hence I cannot just use
wget. The name and location of the file is not visible to me, not even
looking at the source for the page.

Any suggestions welcome.

You might start with your /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd file and find out where
your httpd.conf file is located, i.e., look for a line like:

httpdconf=${HTTPDCONF:-"-f /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf"}

Then, look in your httpd.conf file for the DocumentRoot directive.
In your case that *should* read:

DocumentRoot "/var/www/htdocs"

If not, there's your problem. If that's correct, I'm out of ideas.

HTH,
Robert

Firefox says it is Java(TM) Plug-in 1.6.0_22. I don't have Chrome, and
I don't think I want it.

Since my original post I managed to get Opera to download the file and
automatically open it in Adobe Reader. Hopefully that will continue to
work. But I'd still like to get Firefox to work correctly. What is
weird is that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, and
sometimes it doesn't work at first but then half an hour later it does.

Yes. That's what I was talking about. What I would need for something 
like that is a link from localhost/index.php that opens 
localhost/cmsms/index.php. I think this agrees with some of the other 
advice the list has given. If all it was was an html file, you could 
drag it into a browser and it would work. Because it's php, it has to 
follow the DocumentRoot route, which is most likely localhost/index.php. 
At least, I think I have that right.

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT

? ? ? ? ? ? ?PLUG Meeting will be different than normal

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Richard Stallman
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?is speaking at
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?Portland State University
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?during PLUG's normal meeting time.

? ? ? ? So, instead of having a PLUG meeting we will attend
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?Richard Stallman's talk at 7:30 PM at

? ? ? ? The PSU Native American Student and Community Center
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?710 SW Jackson St
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?Portland Oregon 97201

? ? And if Stallman's talk gets out early enough we will
? ? go over to The Lucky Lab Northwest Beerhall at 1945 NW Quimby
? ? Portland, Oregon afterwards.

? ? *******************************************************************

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Abstract
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? for
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?Richard Stallman Talk

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Presented by
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?Portland State University
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?Chapter of
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?Association of Computing Machinery

? ? The Free Software Movement campaigns for computer users' freedom
? ? to cooperate and control their own computing. The Free Software
? ? Movement developed the GNU operating system, typically used with
? ? the Linux kernel, specifically to make these freedoms possible.

? ? The Portland State University Chapter of the Association for
? ? Computing Machinery and the Computer Science Department are proud
? ? to welcome Richard Stallman to PSU for this general-interest talk.
? ? Mr. Stallman is the father of the free software movement and the
? ? concept of 'copyleft', the original author of GNU Emacs, the GNU
? ? Compiler Collection, and many of the utilities used in the GNU/Linux
? ? operating system.

? ? This event is free and open to the general public. Mr. Stallman will
? ? be available for a brief Q&A session following the talk.

   Yes, /var/www/htdocs/cmsms/index.php exists.

   No, there are no virtual hosts in /etc/httpd/httpd.conf.

   And, other local applications work just fine. So did this one last
October. When the old hardware broke and files were restored from the backup
to the new hard drive something affecting only this one local application
must have changed. I'm trying to find out what that change was.

The log message is quite
clear:? /cmsms/index.php is not found.
You still have not provided the
DocumentRoot for your system.
(and I do believe that lack of rwx
permissions for the index.php for the webserver UID would generate a different
error, but....)

   Excuse me, Michael, but I keep reporting it as /var/www/htdocs. In
/etc/httpd/httpd.conf it's shown as

DocumentRoot "/srv/httpd/htdocs"

   Somewhere (and I can't find it right now), /srv translates to /var/www.

   Other local applications (such as my accounting program) are also in
/var/www/htdocs/ and work just fine.

   Found the source of the error: I mis-specified the postgres options when
rebuilding the latest PHP package so neither pgsql.so nor pdo_pgsql.so was
built and installed.

The Calagator info I see here:

http://calagator.org/events/1250460423

states that the talk will go from 7-9pm. So you probably want to correct 
the mention of 7:30 above unless you have access to newer information.

Thanks,

The link to the ACM of PSU website in that calagator entry says 7:30.
I just contacted the PSU ACM folks on IRC.  They say that the doors
open at 7pm, talk starts at 7:30pm.

Thanks for clarifying this, Russell. I had only looked at the Calagator

We managed to get our portlandfiber.com blog back into operation:

  http://www.portlandfiber.com/feed/

The longer version of my argument is here:

  http://www.portlandfiber.com/2011/03/google-fiber-in-portland-is-dead-long-live-portland-fiber-instead/

Mary Beth says the public meeting schedule has slipped a little due to
a bureau shuffle at city council a month or two ago, so they probably
won't be held earlier than the second half of April, maybe later.

   Hokay. I tracked this down to config.php in the cmsms/ directory. I
believe it is related to the string used to identify postgres-9.x to cmsms
and I'm waiting for insights from that forum.

The sad thing is, for all the happy talk from the FCC, they are
unwilling to take a substantive action that amounts to anything.
Seriously, there is *NO* prospect that the FCC or Congress will *ever*

Hi

Just discovered a problem with my web site..

If I enter  www.website.info   I get the correct stuff <not the real name>

If I enter website.info  I get another one of my sites not the right one.

Based on that information does anyone have a clue?
I have none..  Don't know if it has always behaved this way.

I am guessing there should be a fix in apache?

TIA

Are these publicly viewable websites? Why not share the URLs?

First Questions to Answer:
Do www.website.info and website.info resolve to the same IP?

Are you using virutal hosts?  Is one of these falling through to the default site 
because it doesn't match ServerName or ServerAlias definitions?

Marvin,

   Looks to me like you need an .htaccess file in your document root to
re-write the latter address to the former address.

   In my case I did this:

RedirectMatch permanent ^http://appl-ecosys\.com ^http://www.appl-ecosys.com/$

   Woiks.

how are you defining your virtualhost? ServerName www.website.info?

Apache does not make any assumptions about different hostnames pointing to
the same place. You have to have both a ServerName and a ServerAlias if you
want to use both names. I usually use the base domain as the ServerName (
website.info) and use the other as the alias (ServerAlias www.website.info).

it would be nice if you could post your entire virtualhost config entry. you
can sanitize it by replacing names specific to your setup with placeholders.

I actually recommend against using .htaccess files for most sites,
unless you have very specific requirements about allowing lots of less
privileged users directly edit your web root settings.  (It is rare
that you can't accomplish all the same things without .htaccess.)

In order to interpret .htaccess files, Apache needs to traverse every
single parent and ancestor directory of every document accessed to
check to see if the config file exists and if its settings have
changed.  In addition, .htaccess files can be a source of security
issues.

Marvin, once you get things working, consider moving those .htaccess
settings back into the vhost config, and then disable AllowOverride
(the setting which allows .htaccess files to work) entirely.

Good luck,
tim

Tim

I am quickly running into a brick wall..  I did create this file and
it didn't help..

I posted my config file yesterday......  Which I cleaned up and
doesn't even have the old web site that still comes up..

I cleaned my history on my browser....

I may just try a different browser and see what that does...  In case
firefox has this stored somewhere that history doesn't get?

Thanks

Marvin

Beware of browser cache loading
old versions of sites after you make changes - it is crazy
making.
Choices are to use another browser or taking care to shift-click
the reload button

This may be obvious, but just to be sure:  You did restart Apache
after making the configuration changes, right?  

apachectl restart

or 

/etc/init.d/apache restart

or similar

I wrote a tool once that looked at every .htaccess file and hoisted it
with the proper <Directory> name into a central conf file.
Unfortunately, it looks like it's not around any more. :(

Others suggested verifying that the DNS records are correct. Have you done
this yet?

ping website.info
ping www.website.info

you should get the same IP address for both.

for example:

wes at ryoko:~$ ping the-wes.com
PING the-wes.com (209.20.82.208) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from ryoko.the-wes.com (209.20.82.208): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64
time=0.000 ms

wes at ryoko:~$ ping www.the-wes.com
PING the-wes.com (209.20.82.208) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from ryoko.the-wes.com (209.20.82.208): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64

? ? The Free Software Movement campaigns for computer users' freedom

? ? Compiler Collection, and many of the utilities used in the GNU/Linux
? ? operating system.

? ? This event is free and open to the general public. Mr. Stallman will

Hello,

I had some experience with SQL Ledger a few years ago.
It served the needs of the company I was working for, but we saw it had some
room to grow.  I have not really followed it since then.

Message-ID: <4D9EADB6.7020307@nathanewilliams.com>

hey all,

i'm sure most folks who have been paying moderately close attention 
already know that gnome 3 was officially released today, but i hadn't 
seen anyone bring it up, but in case you've been living under a rock...

hey! gnome 3 wasl released today!

i've been using it in the fedora 15 alpha for a few weeks so far, and 
i'm quite impressed. there's a few things to adjust to, but over all i'm 
very pleased with the new approach to desktop interaction. probably the 
only thing that makes me a little hesitant is the gsettings approach to 
configuration, which seems a lot more like the windows registry than 
traditional linux config files.

there's been quite a lot of controversy over the new gnome shell, and 
people either seem to be all for it or unbelievably irritated by it from 
what i've seen in the blogosphere.

has anyone else tried it out yet? any impressions to share?

regards,

nathan

Gnucash is the one that always appears at the top of the list. It is
lacking a lot of things, e.g., payroll. Also, you really have to know
your accounting because it is rigidly double entry and assumes you know
the correct offsets. However it does have the ability to import data
from Quicken (although not Quickbooks).

LedgerSMB (www.ledgersmb.org) is a fork of SQL Ledger. Clean up of the 
code and the database has been done and is going on.

Many SQL Ledger users have moved (or are moving) to LedgerSMB.

Daniel,

   Sure do! There's a fork of SQL-Ledger (although Armaghan refuses to call
it a fork) called Ledger-123. He and the other developers have fixed broken
code, cleaned the code, patched bugs, and added features. I've been nudging
him to add more service-business-oriented features and they'll eventually be
there.

   L123 is adaptable to virtually all businesses. There is a great community
on the mail list and if you know perl you can do things yourself. Most of us
use postgres as a backend, but there are choices, and it will work with
almost every Web browser.

   I've been using it for a decade now and really like it.

Rich

Have not tried it yet, but thanks for sharing your impressions.  I'm
probably in a space that could be best described as "curious, but not
anxious" to try this out.  For the time being, I'm using Ubuntu Maverick
(mostly because I failed to get either Arch or Debian installed or
working correctly on this laptop), and I'm not planning on upgrading to
Natty when it is released.  I'll probably wait a few months, for kinks
to be ironed out.  Natty won't be using Gnome 3 by default anyway, it'll
be using the similar-but-different "Unity," and I'm also curious (but
not anxious) to see how those two approaches to the desktop compare and
contrast.

Fun but confusing times in *nix-o-sphere, all of which probably means
another year of this not being the fabled "year of Linux on the
desktop."

i've been following the Gnome3/Gnome Shell and Ubuntu Unity development 
for > a year now, and using Ubuntu Netbook Remix lightly for a few 
months on a lovely little System76 Starling 10" screen netbook. UNR's 
shell seems roughly like a step between the traditional Gnome desktop 
and Gnome Shell / Unity. So, from my sitting on the sidelines, i can 
extrapolate a bit from my experience with UNR.

UNR is fine on a small (typical tablet size, but larger than smartphone) 
screen, and would probably function well on a touchscreen. However, it 
definitely is a UI for a content-browsing, communication, and 
info-consumption device, with a tiny bit of casual content-creation 
capability. As a developer, it's NOT a suitable UI for the kinds of 
programming i do, for writing long documents, or for general-purpose 
computing. It's heavily dependent in a pointing device, you can't use it 
fully from the keyboard.

Smartphone UIs such as those offered by iOS and Android are great at 
what they do. Tablets that use those OSen but lack phone capability are, 
to me (as some industry article mentioned this week), little better than 
portable TVs/media-consumption toys.

It seems like Gnome Shell and Unity are trying to bridge both worlds - 
traditional GUI for large/multiple displays, and pointer- & 
gesture-dependent/small-form-factor displays. The early reviews of both 
Gnome Shell and Unity are pretty well split between love and hate. As 
someone who's lived almost daily since 1984 with the well-known desktop 
metaphor and WIMP (windows/icons/menus/pointer) interaction model, as 
well as with the *ix command line, i'd welcome a completely new 
interaction model for my meat-and-potatoes working environment if it 
made organizing information and workflow easier and more intuitive.

Message-ID: <20110408183819.GA16505@gate.kl-ic.com>

Early wednesday morning April 6, yum update loaded glibc-2.5-58. 
This seems to be what broke gnome-panel on my Scientific Linux 5.4
systems, and is affecting other SL users elsewhere.  If I restart
X, the gnome panel goes away, and sometimes gnome hangs (though
ssh access still works).

While this distro is based on some 3 year old components, the 
panel problem also may be affecting Ubuntu 11.10 alpha:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-panel/+bug/754197

I'm still learning more about this.  Until then, I suggest folks
don't logout/login (which restarts X) until they are sure they
are not affected, or have time to debug it.

I repeat the helpful answer from Rich to my similar question asked about a
year ago (below).  For my business, I'm using gnucash with some success, it
is fast and reliable, but invoicing is awkward and I haven't gotten bank
transaction downloads to work. (How well does LedgerSMB work for those tasks
Rich?).

I gave up on LedgerSMB, when I needed to create the chart of accounts for my
company.  Seemed like there should have been an example I could tweak, but I
didn't find it.

Good Luck.  Please let us know where your journey ends...

On FreeBSD, it's "/usr/local/etc/rc.d/apache22 reload", which does a
soft reload rather than a hard server down-up cycle.  Might be something
similar in Linux.

Patrick,

   I don't use LedgerSMB. I considered it but the features are so far behind
Ledger123 for my needs that I've gone with the latter. And, I never did get
GNUcash to build successfully on Slackware, although others have (on their
machines, not mine).

   Invoice creation in L123 mostly works as I want. It's great when the
invoice amount is fixed: create a sales order and generate an invoice from
that. When using the time card facility (and when working on a retainer and
need to provide details) it's still a work in progress.

   As L123 works now, I can generate a time card report that shows the date,
amount of time, description of that time, and amount with a total amount at
the bottom. However, when that displayed time card report generates a sales
order and used to produce an invoice, those details are dropped in favor of
the default time card contents of date, service code (which in my case is
almost always the same so it's not informative), time, and amount. I can
probably look at the perl code and change the embedded SQL (if that's where
the problem is) or modify the LaTeX variables. I've not looked.

   The statement capability is OK for most folks, but does not work on a
retainer basis. I want to show the retainer payments and time/expense
charges for the duration of the project, with each month's details added.
Or, at least on a month-to-month basis. I'm trying to nudge the key
developers to providing this for us service businesses. Folks with product
businesses (manufacturing/assembly, distribution, retail) love L123 and
that's where the development focus has been.

   L123 has that from SL.

The Fedora/Redhat Apache httpd initscript's "reload" actually HUPs it,
which kills the child processes immediately. Dunno about FreeBSD's.

I've gotten into the habit of using "graceful", which just does:
apachectl -k graceful

That lets child processes finish their current request before being
replaced by children running under the updated config:

apache2ctl graceful
...On Debian flavors, which is nice if you're running a production box
and you don't want to kill apache mid-request.... it also runs
configtest prior to restarting, which is nice in case you''re
experimenting with config options.

Subject: [PLUG] Host Unknown Problem After Name Change
Message-ID: <20110409154255.GA28040@www.gisnet.com>

I've recently set up a new web server running CentOS 5.5 and I wanted to
change the machine name from what it was named when it wsa built to
something else.  So I set hostname=hotspur.gisnet.local and changed the
HOSTNAME= line in /etc/sysconfig/network to HOSTNAME=hotspur.gisnet.local.

The problem I have now is that each night when it tries to send the daily
output from Logwatch to root the mail doesn't get sent because it thinks
that hotspur.gisnet.local doesn't exist. I guess I need to chnage a setting
in some config file, but I can't tell which one(s) to change.  Here's what
I see in maillog (last night before the logs were run I chnaged it back to
lower.gisnet.local, and so the log records for Apr 9 are normal and
correct, but for Apr 8th, you can see the problem:

Bill,

   What do you have in /etc/hosts? Each machine on the LAN should have the
same contents. The format usually is IP address, white space, full name
(e.g., hotspur.gisnet.local), white space, alias (e.g. hotspur).

   On Slackware (and, if I recall correctly, in Red Hat), the network
configuration has separate key/value pairs for hostname, network name, host
IP, gateway IP, and DNS IP.

I was a little shocked - both bidders appeared to be young
students.  I assume that they are living on money from home. 
Which means that the young woman who won the auction will
be explaining an extra $450 expense to Mommy or Daddy.

This is what's in one of my machine's /etc/hosts. I just put names in these
for convenience' sake. I didn't think these were all that criitcal for
changing a machine's name, but like I've said before I've got a lot to
learn about system administration.

/etc/hosts:
# Do not remove the following line, or various programs
# that require network functionality will fail.
127.0.0.1               localhost.localdomain localhost
::1             localhost.localdomain6 localhost6

In hosts? I thought that stuff would be in /etc/syhsconfig/network or
somewhere down that networking directory tree in razamatz.cf or
ishkabibble.conf. (Sorry, but was this stuff hard to learn when you were
first going at it? I think it's especially hard for the knowlessman because
it's in networking where several major software packages come together, and
half the time when I try to debug these sorts of things I don't even know
what I'm looking for, let alone know in what package the problem origiinates. 

What's strange is that even thuogh I've changed hostname interactively, and
also reset it in the /etc/sysconfig/network, and then re-starting
sendmail, the log entries are still using the old name
'lower.gisnet.local'. Also if I enter this command:

> sendmail -bt -d0.1 </dev/null

I get some pretty clear evidence that the new name hasn't 'stuck':

I don't really want edit sendmail.cf, but from the Internet research I've
been doing it looks some do exactly that. Beacuse I found three ways to
solve this (supposedly) and all of them seem fairly complicated, I thought
I'd ask here and get some clarification before I try something I don't
understand. Here's the two (old) web sites I've got that claim to have the
solution (I think):
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-server-73/change-sender-address-of-outgoing-emails-in-sendmail-571828/
and

Bill,

   Professional SysAdmins will correct me if I'm wrong, but /etc/hosts,
/etc/hosts.allow, /etc/hosts.deny, /etc/hosts.equiv, and /etc/host.conf
identify the hosts on your local nectwork so they can directly communicate
with one another. In /etc/host.conf here I have:

[root at salmo ~]# less /etc/host.conf
order hosts, bind
multi on

So the system looks in the hosts file first.

   Read the wikipedia page on /etc/hosts:

                <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29>

> In hosts? I thought that stuff would be in /etc/syhsconfig/network or

   Again, in Slackware (with more BSD than SysV in some aspects compared with
the Red Hats and relatives), /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf holds port information;
e.g.,

# Config information for eth0:
IPADDR[0]="192.168.55.1"
NETMASK[0]="255.255.255.0"
USE_DHCP[0]=""
DHCP_HOSTNAME[0]=""

> (Sorry, but was this stuff hard to learn when you were first going at it?

   Actually, no. But, I spent a year reading about linux before installing
RH-4.0 and booting into it the first time. I also bought, read, and used a
ton of books. I've six of thse that I was going to give to Goodwill since I
no longer need/use them, but I'll send them to you via media mail:

   - Linux in a Nutshell by Jessica Perry Hekman.
   - Linux System Administration, A Users Guide by Marcel Gagne'.
   - Linux Cookbok, by my friend Carla Schroder.
   = Running Linux, 2nd Ed, by Matt Welsh and Lar Kaufman.
   - Building Secure Servers With Linux, by Michael D. Bauer.
   = Multitool Linux, by Michael Schwarz et al.

   You can re-imburse me the postgage cost. They may be old but they have the
basic information that will increase your understanding and comfort.

   That's true. However, once you understand the overall structure it all
becomes clearer and makes sense. The key aspect of linux (and the other
unices) comes down to what I was told many years ago: linux tools are
single-purpose and easy to understand, but there are thousands of such
tools.

> I don't really want edit sendmail.cf, ...

   Despite your need, like the needs of most of us, to do too many things at
the same time, seriously consider replacing sendmail with postfix. (There
are other replacements but I've been happily running postfix here since I
brought our mail sever inside more than a dozen years ago.) Much easier to
understand, maintain, and configure.

As Rich suggested, replace sendmail with postfix.  You'll gain normal-human 
readable configuration files and, in IMHO, have a more secure system.

Only one correction: the bit about "hosts on your local network". /etc/hosts
and related files are not limited in their scope to local (LAN) hosts. You
can put any IP address/DNS name mapping you wish in /etc/hosts. And you can
block script kiddies in Asia, Russia, etc. by adding entries in /etc/hosts.deny.

The way to think of /etc/hosts is simply as a way to override all DNS
lookups for specified hostnames. /etc/hosts is always consulted first, and
if the information is found there, the real DNS server is never consulted.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1104111001500.17442@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've made what appear to be all necessary adjustments to the adodb_lite
SQL drivers to accommodate postgres-9.x. I'm now getting a 404 Page Not
Found error when I try to open /var/www/htdocs/cmsms/index.php (as
localhost/cmsms/index.php). My Google searches find nothing I see as useful
in explaining how to identify why the page isn't being found.

   However, I may have a hint.

   If I look at that file with a pager I see the php code. But, when I open
that file in firefox I see errors:

Site down for maintenance.
"; exit; } if (!is_writable(TMP_TEMPLATES_C_LOCATION) ||
!is_writable(TMP_CACHE_LOCATION)) { echo ''; echo '

The following directories must be writable by the web server:
'; echo 'tmp/cache
'; echo 'tmp/templates_c
'; echo '

Please correct by executing:
chmod 777 tmp/cache
chmod 777 tmp/templates_c
or the equivilent for your platform before continuing.

   I saw that message last week and changed permissions to 777:

drwxrwxrwx 2 rshepard users 4096 2010-11-08 09:49 cache/

   If the cache/ and templates_c/ directories are world-writable does it
matter who the owner or primary group is? There are no files in the cache
directory and three files from last Friday in the templates_c directory:

Whenever I change the hostname on a machine, I do a recursive grep on
the /etc for the old hostname.

  grep -r <oldhostname> /etc

then manually edit the places that make sense.  When the old hostname
is gone, I might even reboot to make sure any running processes get
the message.

Thanks, Rich! I'm sure I'll get good use out of this library. Even old
books can teach one whose current liquid (as in ready to use) knowledge is
is just a very small drop in a very large bucket.  I'll be happy to cover the
shipping cost, no problem.
 
I'm not sure that all this about /etc/hosts and resolv.conf answers my
question, because I can't find the old host name in any of those files, so
whatever is being done now isn't being done there. So do you or anyone
else know if the original machine name gets embedded into sendmail's
configuration when you first set up, and I have to go digging into the the
sendmail configuration to change it, or if this is happening elsewhere?

It's not critical, I can live with machine names of 'upper' and 'lower'
(named imaginatively after their positions in the rack) but I thought changing
machine names would be simple. Man, the water gets deep fast no matter
which way I step off my tiny island of Linux knowledge!

Hi

How many RAM sticks do you have...

A dead stick could do that..

Pull them both out and see if any thing happens..

Good luck

Bill,

   That's because you have nothing other than 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts, and
hosts.allow, hosts.deny, and hosts.equiv are probably equally empty.

Now that's the kind of surgical precision I like! It's simple and though 
time consuming, it's not my time it'll consume, and I'll bet this gets 
the job done, too. Not as elegant as a comprehensive analysis of the 
evidence, leading to a deep understanding of all the underlying factors, 
culminating in an informed determination of the cause and dramatically 
concluding with a laser-sharp master stroke, but it'll do.

I'll give that a try. Thanks for this and all the other responses! And 
the 3 - 0 vote for Postfix. Sounds like
replacing sendmail with postxfix should go on my to-do list.

I would also try booting with all peripherals and cards removed.  I have
seen a shorted hard drive cause a similar problem.

Yesterday afternoon, I opened the box, pushed on all the connectors, 
including the memory sticks, plugged the power back in, hit the power 
button, and it started right up. I have no idea if it was fixed by 
anything that I did, but it's back to working, so I'm happy.

Thanks for the idea.

Caveat:  I have essentially no training in electronics, but lots of
experience in resolving failing hardware.  There may be some witch-doctoring
nonsense in my notes below, but it works for me.

1) I'm suspicious of the power supply.  I've never heard of a recent (last
decade) power supply that wouldn't power down if you held the power button
down for 10 seconds.

2) While you've got the case open, check for bad electrolytic capacitors.
This is a 5-second check (once you know what to look for) that can save
hours of diagnostics.  Here's a reasonably good article on that:
http://www.capacitorlab.com/visible-failures/.  In the first picture, I
count three good electrolytics, in the upper left, center, and bottom.  The
rest are all bad.  This is an extreme case, as I usually only find one or
two bad.  It doesn't matter where you find the capacitors (anywhere on the
motherboard, on a PCI board, etc.).  If they bulge, they're bad.  They might
still work for a while, but they're failing.

3) I once spent two hours trying to diagnose hardware problems before taking
a machine into the shop where it worked fine, and continued to work fine for
a couple of years after that.  The tech recommended for next time: "Before
you get too involved, turn it off, unplug every wire, leave it for about 20
minutes, and try it again.  Sometimes electronics can get in an incorrect
state, and a complete power-down and discharge will allow them to reset."

4) If all that fails, unplug every component you can do without temporarily
(every PCI board, all USB devices, extra hard drives, DVD drive), then see
how it does.  Devices can fail in ways that cause them to flood a machine
with meaningless signals (at least that's my theory).  I have a machine
right now that will take way too long to run its POST memory check if a
particular external USB hub is plugged in.  Once the machine is up, plugging
in the USB hub is fine.  I think the hub must be slamming the bus with noise
until the O/S gets far enough up to reset it somehow.

Good luck.

                                     -Brian

Dick,

   It's a repair technique with the technical name of 'benign neglect.' I've
used it to repair computers, washing machines, and other mechanical things.
When benign neglect fails, percussive maintenance is an approach to
consider.

I agree with Rich and Rod.  I've been running postfix for years after 
trying to decipher sendmail and it's security issues and I can say that 
it runs well on an old P4 and has been serving about 50 users that 
send/receive 15-35 thousand e-mails a day.

Just in case someone runs into an unusual situation, here's a couple 
more details that could be useful.

hosts.deny and host.allow only apply to programs that are linked with 
tcpwrappers(libwrap).  Fortunately this is true of most, if not all 
network programs one might typically encounter.

The order of name resolution is controlled by /etc/nsswitch.conf.  The 
hosts: line could be altered to change the order of lookups or insert 
things like LDAP, NIS, etc.

   Well, it won't win. The politicians and PC (that's 'political

Old euphemism.  It is closely related to "percussive attitude
adjustment", favored by thugs and system administrators.

Along a similar vein ... Alan Olsen has claimed to be in favor of
phrenotherapy.  Phrenology is a pseudoscientific study of bumps on the skull
as a way to understand various derangements.  Alan suggested jokingly that
phrenotherapy, the application of additional bumps to the skull, might
correct misguided ideas in some individuals.

I suppose that turns a suitably equipped sys admin into a phrenotherapist.

Some years ago, in a former position at a software company, we had to set up our own postfix server for our QA department, as the testers were able to routinely cause the Exchange server to fall over under the load they placed on it. We set up postfix on a PIII, and were never able to overwhelm it with email.

Rich,

Double check your web server configuration.  Some distributions have the 
DocumentRoot /srv/www, others /var/www/htdocs, even others have it at 
/srv/www/html.

But this might be non-sense if the site is serving other pages.

Ken,

   In Slackware, /srv/ is an alias for /var/www/.

Ken,

   I've traced the problem to the ErrorHandler404() function in
misc.functions.php. However, I cannot find where control is passed to the
error handler for bailing out of the application.

   Looking at the on-line PHP manual I discovered a function called
debug_print_traceback() but inserting it at the top of ErrorHandler404()
does nothing visible. Sigh.

   I signed up on the php-general mail list but so far have not received any
pointers on how to use that function (or a better one) to learn where the
startup is going wrong.

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

The error 404 usually means the file is not found.  So, what is the 
program looking for?

Ken,

   Aha! You've identified the 64-bit question: what is the application
seeking? That's what I'm trying to learn. The opening page is index.php, but
the function displaying the error, ErrorHandler404(), is being called by
someone I've yet to discover.

   Looking at the on-line php manual I found a function,
debug_print_traceback(), and put that at the top of ErrorHandler404(). No
joy: nothing visible or in directories. I subscribed to the php-general mail
list and hope someone there can help me either use that function properly or
show me a better way to learn what's calling the error handler.

   In C and Python I know how to step through the code one line at a time. I
know nothing about php (and have no interest or need to know more than it
takes to get this running again.)

For those of you running RHEL5 clones ( RedHat Enterprise Linux 5,
Scientific Linux 5, CentOS 5, etc ), and had to deal with the glibc
version 58 patch problem, here's a downrev patch that works. 

It is Really Cool to run a distro supported by folks who are even
more responsive than The Upstream Vendor.

From:    Troy Dawson <dawson at FNAL.GOV>
Subject: TESTING - glibc security update fix for SL5

Hello,
There was a bug with the latest glibc update that went out for SL5.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=693882
It causes evolution to fail, and the gnome panel to crash.

As far as we know, this bug doesn't affect any non-graphical 
environment, so servers should be safe.

We have created a glibc with two changes taken out that fix the bug. 
The problem is that it removes one of the security patches.

*Security Update Removed* CVE-2011-0536
The fix for CVE-2010-3847 introduced a regression in the way the dynamic
loader expanded the $ORIGIN dynamic string token specified in the RPATH 
and RUNPATH entries in the ELF library header. A local attacker could 
use this flaw to escalate their privileges via a setuid or setgid 
program using such a library.

*Security Updates Still Applied*
CVE-2011-1095, CVE-2011-1071, CVE-2010-0296

This fix is for those admins who had to downgrade their glibc due to 
evolution and/or gnome-panel crashing.  We feel it is better for them to 
have three security patches, rather than none.

We do not plan on pushing this out, we are waiting for a fix from TUV.

To test or update

SL5
-------

            yum --enablerepo=sl-testing update glibc\*

or you can download rpm's by hand at

http://ftp.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/5rolling/testing/i386/glibc/
http://ftp.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/5rolling/testing/x86_64/glibc/

glibc-2.5-58.el5_6.2.6.sl5

more and more difficult.

I was using Google Sites for a while, but the 20mb limitation kicks in 
on large docs with screen shots. Does anyone know how to setup a web 
server with similar functionality to the file upload features of 
providers like Yahoo and Google? Do they just ftp through port 80?

thanks,

Have you looked at WebDav and configured your own Apache server to support
it?

I've seen a few articles on that and could probably forward one off-list
if you're interested.

I stumbled upon Ubuntu One which seems to suffice for now. They have a 
5gb upload limit.

Other people have been telling you how this can be done; my question
is: are you sure you want to?

If the company is putting more and more restrictions between you and
the machine you want to send the data to, they are probably not doing
that *accidentally* or anything.  Which means that your work-arounds
here are breaking deliberately placed rules, which is, y'know, at
least a written caution offence, and maybe grounds for immediate
dismissal.

For example, in my last job where you doing for unrelated data would
potentially still have cost us the right to work with the government
on health data for five years, taking half our revenue stream away in
a shot?  Ouch.  The company would *not* be impressed.

No, they upload to port 80.  Which requires appropriate software at
the server end, which is actually surprisingly hard to come by.

As an implementation consultant you create a LOT of doc. At some point 
you need to get it from point A to point B. Invariably one of those 
points is across a corporate firewall. As enterprise software has become 
more complex, the supporting doc has grown. I currently have a 60MB doc 
that goes through the step by step of installing automation software 
across 6 servers. It contains a LOT of screen shots, thus big file size.

There is a rule that says you can't plug in USB devices that don't have 
encryption software, which by the way only works on Windows. There isn't 
a rule that says you can't move doc from your linux laptop to the 
Corporate sharepoint. The former is done for security, the latter is an 
unintended side effect.

File size limitations on email aren't security prevention measures. They 
are cost of storage issues. I understand the need to cut down on the 
general rabble emailing 100MB files around, but at some point you need 
to be able to get large amounts of information from point A to point B 
without having to open a help desk ticket, get 6 approvals, wait four 
weeks for a firewall port to be opened, all on a three week contract. 
Diminishing returns on efficiency mean diminishing returns on productivity.

WebDAV is a good suggestion, but at the end of the day, Bank of America 
or JPMC need the doc to reside on their internal sharepoint, be in 
doc/docx format, and all the other trappings that come with working in 
corporate environments. I love to evangelize F/OSS, but I don't sell you 
the bridge, I just build it.

For those facing the same issue, I got around the problem with Ubuntu 
One. 5 GB file size limit, thank you very much Canonical.

Any AIX gurus here?

I'm looking to get info on what files SMIT updates when changing things

without getting into details F6 will give you the command the smit

unfortunatly sometimes it is a ksh script. More details can be found
after you run the smitty command
in /smit.log and /smit.transaction (may be transactions.

90% of the systems config is kept in what is called the ODM database.
do a man page on odmget

The mozplugger Debian package configures things so that pdf files open
in Firefox/Iceweasel windows. I don't know what the Fedora equivalent

Just to follow up -- I was having this exact problem and adding ipython.el to my

I don't know what happened, but it cleared up when I did the silly thing
and closed and reopened Firefox. 

Silly me, tried the google translator first, the characters were
detected as Chinese, but the translation was non-sensical.

Is there something else I should check? Nothing weird appears in
my /var/log/secure, and an rpm -Va doesn't show anything odd.

Yes, it's this Sunday again, April 17, 2011! It's at Free Geek, 1741 SE
10th Avenue in beautiful east side Portland! It starts at 1 pm and ends
at 5 pm.

Bring your computer with Linux problems and we'll replace them with
brand new problems! Bring your evil operating system and we'll replace
it with a lovely Linux system! Or come and help others solve their
Linux problems. Or come to ask questions. Or just come and look over
shoulders to see what it's all about.

We have monitors, keyboards, meece, and a few other devices. All you
need to bring is the box. And we have the latest versions of major
distros that we can burn to CD for you.* We'll even have coffee and
probably munchables. And mostly we'll have fun!

*The latest Ubuntu that I have is 10.10 because 11.04 won't be released
until April 28. If someone wants the current release candidate I'll
download it; otherwise I'll wait to add 11.04 to my library on the
28th. Of course, I also have 10.04 for those who want to stick with LTS
versions.

Yet another data point, it is normal for me as well.

If 1 out of 7 people is paranoid, and the other 6 people in the room are
normal.... maybe its you.

(I kid, I kid)

But seriously, time to run a malware and A/V scan there bucko.
Browser hijacking is one of the big things those buggers do these days.
Malwarebytes Anti Malware is my first suggestion.
Actually my second.  My first is probably obvious- run Linux :)




Oh and because I just couldn't help myself-

Oh OK, so you literally meant Chinese.
Some of us who thought it was malware (which is a legitimate guess based on
the limited info), didn't realize it was just translating the page to
(incorrect) Chinese.

So next possibility is a cookie issue with La Volpe di Fuoco (firefox), or
maybe a third party plugin.

I did think about localization at first. I get pages in German all the time.
But then I thought, "PLUG wouldn't have a localized site, would they?" It's
pretty cool if PLUG's site is localized. But I get it in English, es tut mir

I'm running RHEL 6. 

I do not see a Malwarebytes version for Linux. When I search for your
other suggestion "La Volpe di Fuoco", all I see is a reference to an '82
Italian movie. 

I've just run chkrootkit on my system, and all I see are "nothing found"
and "not infected" messages.

One other strange thing I'm seeing now is the same Chinese in some
google ads on several side banners. The only reference that might be
related is from an ArchLinux site,
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=71447 

Thanks,
Mike

As I suggested in the other branch to this thread, it was my mistake. In
fact, it was a traceroute that tipped me off.

Since I was still seeing gibberish Chinese in the banner ads (yes, it is
Chinese characters, but the the google translator interpretation
suggests more gibberish than something real)

I'm guessing it might be java-related. So I've just tried reinstalling a
fresh copy of the Java Runtime Environment from the Sun site. If it
doesn't help, I'll let y'all know.

Thanks,
Mike

Sorry about that, see my other post (RE: possibly a cookies issue).

I was going on the assumption, as several others did, that you were running
Windows at that point and had a malware infection.
Malware Bytes is a Windows anti-malware program, thus is useless on Linux.
It is one I recommend to all my Windows using friends/family/acquaintances
etc (those who are unwilling or unable to use Linux, or at least Mac...).

Your first post just said gibberish Chinese, which many of us took as a sign
of an infection, and not literally a Chinese translation problem.

La Volpe di Fuoco is "Firefox" in Italian (or as far as Google translate can
give me anyway).  I have been playing Assassins Creed Brotherhood which
takes place in Renaissance Italy.... so sorry about that ;)  It is not a
suggestion for a program to run.

Since you are getting persistent Chinese issues it seems like it could be a
cookies problem, or something along those lines.

Message-ID: <BANLkTikes-ToW-TWn=vYyH5Z2rA7beLERA@mail.gmail.com>

I asked sometime ago about what distribution I should use for a small FTP
and sometimes small Web Server.  I had a Mandrake 8.x system but the file
system wasn't letting me deal with multiple GB files like DVD iso images. So
I moved off what I needed to keep and wiped it. I started playing with
Ubuntu Desktop 10.04 and am sorta happy an sorta not. Here's what I I
need/cpuld do before. ( Don't laugh, I mainly work on NON PC / NON Unix
based IBM gear. I also mainly use Windows for my work and personal systems )
I dont' want to trust a Windows box to do this stuff open to the world.

#1 On my previous system, I had worked my way through a basic firewall setup
that allowed FTP and HTTP through my External IP
#2 I could thru linuxconf quickly enable/disable/vhange the external
interface when I wasn't activily using it.
#3 FTP was ProFTPd
#4 Liked Midnight Commander for some file / object work
#5 Used Webmin for a few basic tasks.

So is Ubuntu Desktop where I want to be for this simple stuff or do I want a
server class version of Ubuntu? The splash screens for the Ubuntu SW  site
says 1000's of programs, but the largeswt list I get there is 267, big
difference. I have pulled ProFTPd and Webmin and got them installed. I am
having trouble with getting the firewall working and a way to simply disable
the external IP when I don't need it.  I can bring this beast by the clinic
on Sunday, if that is the best place to get it working as desired.

With any major Linux distribution, you'll have access to more or less
the same set of software.  Generally the only difference between
versions of a distribution (and even different distributions) is the
software that is installed by default and possibly what kinds of
package management tools they rely on.

If you're looking to enable/disable the external interface entirely
for all services, then you shouldn't need to bother with the firewall.
Just disable the interface when it isn't needed.  This could be done
with network manager or whatever other GUI the distro provides for
that, or possibly a command like:
  ifdown eth0

With any fresh install of Ubuntu you will have very few packages
available. That is because they ship Ubuntu with most of the
repositories disabled.

Go into System > Administration > Software Sources and enable the
additional repositories. You should end up with 25-30,000 packages. You
can also enable the repositories from within Synaptic Package Manager.

Many of us have been there. We will keep the children in check.

I don't serve off of Windows without a firewall. :)  Too many late nights.

Good practice is to *only* allow the services to each machine that are
required. Some folks like to stop it at a firewall, but I'm a
belt-and-suspenders guy, so I run firewalls everywhere I can,
including the end-box.

Not sure what the Ubuntu equivalent is, but I'm sure there's a GUI
(ugh) and CLI for it.

> #3 FTP was ProFTPd

I won't weigh in too much here, FTP has lots of strong opinions. My
opinion is that FTP should not be used.... ever. Just rsync, or put it
over SSH. (FTP sends passwords over the wire).

DUDE! Classic! Fun UI. Didn't know it was still out there.

Webmin bit me one too many times. It's probably better now, but....
it's kind of like the prom date who gave you that "special" gift....
which required a doctor visit... maybe still hot, but I'm never
getting that close to her again.

> So is Ubuntu Desktop where I want to be for this simple stuff

Yes, and no.

Most of the current support tutorials are desktop focused. However,
they're based on a lay-user target.

> or do I want a
> server class version of Ubuntu?

If you have a keyboard, mouse, and video hooked to the machine, and
are used to such an interface, it might be easier to manage desktop.
If you're used to heads down Linux: text only, no prompts/helps/GUI,
then server class is great (and uses less disk and RAM). In all
honesty, in the last 13 years, I've found that if it's my own box,
text is fine (I'm used to it), but if I have to admin with any other
folks, I need "desktop", or rather, others do.

That's a packaging thing. If you want to install "Office" (of whatever
flavor), there's more than one program installed.

The clinics rock, I can't endorse them enough.... but I do need to show up more.

Wow, I do this automatically, and totally forgot about this step.

Anybody got a link handy for the "non-free" step? Or does the above
cover it now?

FWIW, I run Firefox in a pretty cookie-free mode, having to re-enter
usernames and passwords every time. 

I think the reload of jre helped. Haven't seen the Chinese in the banner
ads since I uninstalled all jre, and reinstalled the Oracle(was Sun) RPM
fresh.

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Backup Alternative Meeting Site
Message-ID: <1302966264.3427.9.camel@Maui>

Folks, 

The other day, I was talking to Gary Schleinkofer, the Networking
Academy Coordinator at PCC. He asked me to pass along his offer to use
PCC classroom facilities for future PLUG meetings (SE Center or Willow
Creek, if I understood him correctly)

I told him that we have established sites for our meetings, but have had
to change venues in the past. But if things change in the future, PCC is
a possible alternate location.

Thanks,
Mike

The other way to do it is direct, via the /etc/apt/sources.list file.
The additional repos are there, just commented out. Basically, repos are
in four categories (+ a few others)

Main (what can be installed at first)
Restricted (non-free software)
Universe (Open source sw not supported by Ubuntu)
Multiverse (non-free software, not supported by Ubuntu)

For more info, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu
and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine 

In addition, I normally tinker with the actual repo URLs. The default
URL IIRC (even though it's "us.archive.ubuntu.com") usually downloads
direct from Ubuntu servers in the UK, which can be a bit slow. I
normally switch that off to mirrors.kernel.org. (Last I checked, the PSU
mirrors seem slow too, I think they have a slower pipe.)	

Thanks,
Mike

The /etc/apt/soutces.list file can be a bit faster than the GUI, but
you still have to reload afterwards. 

I have had issues with the PSU and OSU mirrors. They are definitely the
fastest, but I discovered that they didn't have all the packages. I'm
not sure how that can be if they are "mirrors," but that's what
happened. It may also have been an anomaly, although the time when it
happened the missing files that I needed stayed missing for a week
before it dawned on me to switch mirrors. It was several years ago, but
I recall that when I switched to the US main mirrors my available
packages increased by a couple thousand.

The GUI has a really handy tool for testing the speed of the various
mirrors. Recommended, but check your total package count before and
after changing.

Hi John, 

Last time I tried that GUI tool a couple of years ago, it gave me
results that I didn't trust, like mirror sites in Alberta with 10M
pipes. Sure, it has to be an algorithm combining pipe, load, and
distance. But some human judgement is still required.

Thanks,
Mike

Well I think I have the system pretty much where I need it for now. I have
the firewall only allowing FTP and HTTP on the outside address and both
servers appear to be working fine.  Also have VNC working on the inside
interface.

I do have a question. I setup a couple of users for the purpose of FTPing.
Each has files it its /home directory. On my Mandrake system it was more
server like and a user had to login then startx if they wanted the GUI.
Ubuntu is starting in X and I see all the users I setup. I would just as
soon not see them on the GUI startup/login screen. Is t here a way to hide
these extra users?

Well,  I was trying to get just a terminal/console type startup and have
hosed things up. I told Ubuntu to start in Failsafe with xterm. It still
boots the darn GUI but I now have a small xterm. I've tried a number of
things to get it back based on a couple of web tips I can find... but
nothing much has changed.

Anyone know how to reset things back?

   I have two directories of images where each file name has spaces between
the words. I'm not having success writing a shell script that takes each
name in sequence, removes the white spaces, and leaves the extension as-is.
I'm certain that this can be done in perl, python, ruby, scheme, awk, sed,
and so on. I believe that a shell script would be a one-liner.

   Suggestions appreciated.

There is as perl script called 'rename' that makes this very easy:

$ rename 's/ //g' Some\ File\ Name.ext

Will take the spaces out (destructively, so be careful.  I don't know
how it handles filename conflicts that may arise, I suspect not
gracefully.).  Combined with find and xargs, you can apply it to a
whole directory tree (I haven't tested the following line though, so
beware of typos/etc..):

$ find <path> -type f | xargs rename 's/ //g'

On debian my debian system, 'rename' is a symlink to
/etc/alternatives/rename, which points to /usr/bin/prename, which
apt-file says came with perl.  If you don't have 'rename', try
'prename'.

There are also probably other programs called rename.  This is what I
get if I run 'rename' with no arguments:

 $ rename
Usage: rename [-v] [-n] [-f] perlexpr [filenames]

Shell typically does this in a one liner by calling awk, sed, Perl ...

But since you're not interested in those options it makes it difficult to suggest a solution.

Be careful, rename on Ubuntu is different that that on OpenSuSE.  The command line above with an expression is an OpenSuSE style command.  Also be aware of spaces in directories that are parents of the target file.  I'll post a perl script I wrote to deal with this as soon as I am in front of that machine.

There is as perl script called 'rename' that makes this very easy:

$ rename 's/ //g' Some\ File\ Name.ext

Will take the spaces out (destructively, so be careful.  I don't know
how it handles filename conflicts that may arise, I suspect not
gracefully.).  Combined with find and xargs, you can apply it to a
whole directory tree (I haven't tested the following line though, so
beware of typos/etc..):

$ find <path> -type f | xargs rename 's/ //g'

On debian my debian system, 'rename' is a symlink to
/etc/alternatives/rename, which points to /usr/bin/prename, which
apt-file says came with perl.  If you don't have 'rename', try
'prename'.

There are also probably other programs called rename.  This is what I
get if I run 'rename' with no arguments:

 $ rename
Usage: rename [-v] [-n] [-f] perlexpr [filenames]

--Rogan



Be careful, rename on Ubuntu is different that that on OpenSuSE.  The command line above with an expression is an OpenSuSE style command.  Also be aware of spaces in directories that are parents of the target file.  I'll post a perl script I wrote to deal with this as soon as I am in front of that machine.

if you're going to go that route:
    it's safer to replace the spaces with underlines so 's/ /_/g' 
    the find/xargs will still choke on files with spaces in the names, 
    however the syntax to work with that is find ... -print0 | xargs -0 which then uses NULL as the file name delimiter
    so:  find <path> -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rename 's/ /_/g'

    add -v to rename so it will print out the names of the files it changes
    use -n to not actually rename, but to show what it would have done

Not sure why the need for a "one-liner"?  This bit of script (SH/BASH) 
extracts a list of files (excluding directories).  From there my 
approach would be to either ...
    feed it to AWK
    make a file of it and use EX (within VI) to create the desired 
command lines
... I'd probably use AWK, though.

Keep in mind that it would be a good idea to check for duplicate results 
before actually committing to this ... could be disastrous.
Good luck

I repeat the helpful answer from Rich to my similar question asked about a
year ago (below).  For my business, I'm using gnucash with some success, it
is fast and reliable, but invoicing is awkward and I haven't gotten bank
transaction downloads to work. (How well does LedgerSMB work for those tasks
Rich?).

I gave up on LedgerSMB, when I needed to create the chart of accounts for my
company.  Seemed like there should have been an example I could tweak, but I
didn't find it.

Good Luck.  Please let us know where your journey ends...

That would seem to work:

Rogan,

   There's no 'prename' here, but there is /usr/bin/rename as part of the
util-linux-ng package. The man page does not suggest the flexibility to use
sed to eliminate spaces or replace them with underscores.

   Here, it's:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ rename
call: rename from to files...

   I don't need a list of directories as I copied those files from the cdrom
disk to specific and known directories.

   I like the idea of using awk; for whatever the reason I did not see this
as the most parsimonious solution. I'm probably mistaken, but my
understanding is that sed would be used within a file to make changes
line-by-line, while awk can be fed by the 'ls' command.

Thanks,

Rich

   Looking at the file names in the two directories, I see that all I need to
identify each one uniquely is the image number. So, for example in one
directory, where there 'Some Long File Name 1.jpg' but the number is
inclusive to 60, I type "ls | awk '{print $5}' and see 1.jpg through 60.jpg
on the console. I'll need to experiment how to insert the non-ubuntu rename
command in this command line so the files are renamed rather than listed.
I'll copy a bunch of files to another directory (but can always replace the
originals from the cdrom disk).

   The second directory is more interesting as each file name has the image
number wrapped in parentheses; I'll need to play with the awk command to
figure out how to strip the parentheses from the number.

Thanks,

Rich

So, it sounds like your files are uniquely identified by visible
characters, so this won't be a problem.  If that weren't the case,
then there are three problem scenarios come to mind, all of which are
more or less rooted in the fact that rename is not an injective
(one-to-one) function and its domain is a superset of its codomain.

 - Any time you rename, you *might* rename to something that already
exists.  e.g.; consider the files "READ ME.txt" and "README.txt".  Put
more generally, you're only transforming the files that currently have
spaces, so it's not uniformly applied to all the files in the
directory.

 - The rename is only applied to one file at a time, regardless of how
it may act as a batch job, so there is no guarantee that some
intermediate state of your files won't result in conflicts.

 - If you happen to have any files that are only differentiated by
whitespace, some of those would eventually conflict.  e.g.; "READ ME"
(one space) and "READ  ME" (two spaces)

   Since each file name is unique, there should not be an intermediate state.

Following this thread this morning, two thoughts occur:

1) Add some error checking code to test for the "new" file name, to see 
if it already exists, before making the change.

2) Every program I recall using that involves changing a file name 
already does this, which means somebody already wrote this code. Is 
there a function somewhere that could be called? For example, store the 
old file name in a variable, remove the unwanted characters, then submit 
that variable to the function that looks to see if the name is already 
in use.

You're correct about being

The stream can be the
contents of a file, a bytestream spewing from a pipe,? the output of a command

ANNOUNCEMENT: PLUG Advanced Topics April Meeting

IPv6 Networking with Ted Mittelstaedt: Part 1

The first in a multi-part series on IPv6 networking by Ted Mittelstaedt,
the author of The FreeBSD Corporate Networker's Guide.

Part 1: Theory & management & ISP routing, as well as current events in
the IPv6 realm. For example, did you know that Nortel just sold
Microsoft a huge chunk of IPv4 legacy addresses for something like 7
million dollars? This has really turned the tables on the game. Up until
that happened the thought in the community was that the large ISP's
would be the biggest pushers of IPv6 deployment. But this is an early
indicator of what's going to happen. The large ISPs are going to spend
millions in vacuuming every scrap of IPv4 out of all the corners on the
Internet before they will start pushing their users to go to IPv6. That
is a serious problem for any small ISP that does not have a stock of
IPv4 because they will be run out of numbers and new customers will not
be interested in their IPv6 offerings as long as the large ISPs still
are handing IPv4 out.

Where: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue

When: TUESDAY, April 19th, 7PM

BYO Food and Beverages

Sorry for the late announcement. Tax day distracted quite a few of us.

Those of you of "a certain age" might remember that Ted was the 
networking columnist for Computer Bits. He's probably forgotten more 
about networking than I'll ever know.

Paul,

   While I regulary read Computer Bits I don't know that I paid any attention
to who wrote what. At least, not to the extent that it stuck with me. :-)

I totally disagree.  This was a liquidation at a bankruptcy court, and
Microsoft likely bought it only because they could.

It's very difficult to transfer IPv4 space... the massive routing tables
won't allow a lot more partial transfers.  So if anything, the RIRs will
step in soon and say "transfers not allowed", just to preserve the
routing table size.

I suppose you could *tunnel* a partial space, but that'd be like getting
hand-me-downs... IPv4 traffic that has to be tunneled to get to where it
really needs to go.

If you need a better explanation, consider this.

Suppose I own 4.x.x.x right now (that's 4.0.0.0/8), and I'm really only
using half.  So I decide to sell you 4.N.x.x where N > 127.  Now, if
you're not immediately adjacent to me on the internets (and it's not
possible to be adjacent on multiple vectors, so the answer is *never*),
every single ASN router will have to record *two* routes where they
formerly had one: one toward me for 4.0.0.0/9, and one towards you at
4.128.0.0/9.

If people are allowed to do that, the routers would quickly collapse.
The RIRs won't allow that.

Thus, there's not going to be an IPv4 gold rush, and instead IPv6 *must*
be deployed before the first RIRs are dry.

I'm not an expert on backbone routing, but ... I don't grasp how a few
extra ipv4 routes are going to lead to armegedon but ipv6 routing
isn't.  Surely with the proliferation of address space, ipv6 is going
to be *more* expensive to route than ipv4.

My little 200MHz 32meg RAM Mips-based Netgear WGT634Us are maintaining
routing tables hundreds of routes long and it doesn't seem to be
causing them much strain.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BGP_Table_growth.svg

Are you really suggesting that even 256 (instead of 2) new routes is
going to make a difference?

Btw, I am all for IPv6 deployment.  I've been asking ISPs about it and
they are mostly non-responsive.  "People aren't asking for it, so you
asking for it is an anomaly we are going to ignore".  Maybe they think
it will cut into their $/static-IP business.  I guess Comcast was
doing some test deployments in some of their markets.

Isn't this a very strict requirement?  I guess if you hire a consultant,
he/she is not staff, so OK.

Personal Telco *is* 100% volunteers.  Our bigger problem is that we
don't have a cohesive network from a routing point of view.  We are an
aggregation of independently-served networks.  So the advantage of
this for us isn't so great.  We could get along fine with the /48 we
got from hurricane electric and tunnel between nodes.  If we were
purely wireless and/or backhauled to a common point, it would be more
useful.

It's been pointed out that I mis-read the original post.
Having gone back and re-read the original I see that indeed I did.

My apologies to Rich for misconstruing his request and openness to solution implementations.

I am looking for suggestions for a templating system.  I need to
generate a tree of configuration files to "bake" into a firmware
image.  My tree overlays (replaces) the standard configuration to
localized it for a particular situation.  I have rolled my own in Perl
and sed, primarily, but it seems like this problem is not unique to me
and SOMEONE MUST HAVE DONE THIS BETTER BEFORE!

I'd like something that supports some if-then-else logic as well as
variable replacement.  For example, the config files might be shaped
different if I am bridging rather than routing.  Or different target
devices might have different numbers or types of interfaces.

Can anybody suggest something they like?

One thing that comes to mind, besides something like xslt, would be
ViewVC's (formerly ViewCVS) "easy templates" which comes in a module
called ezt.py.  The application uses them extensively for HTML
generation, but it is a general, simple templating language with
conditionals, loops, file includes, and of course variable
replacement.

Have you looked at m4? It's ancient, of course, but m4 and a Makefile

It's also worth noting that PHP is a templating language on steroids. 
Command-line PHP might be overkill for you, but it can do just about 
anything.

If you can tolerate a Java-based solution, Velocity is really nice. 
Simple, expressive in-template language with variable replacement, 
conditional flow control, and expressions. Well-supported, mature 
framework. The only real Java skill required to use it is the ability to 
construct a command line to generate your output.

The explosion of web frameworks has given rise to scads of templating
systems. Some are focused on HTML, but may be general purpose enough
for your use.

I'm just starting to use Jinja2:

If you're rockin' the Perl you might go for Template Toolkit:

REMINDER: PLUG Advanced Topics April Meeting

IPv6 Networking with Ted Mittelstaedt: Part 1

The first in a multi-part series on IPv6 networking by Ted Mittelstaedt,
the author of The FreeBSD Corporate Networker's Guide.

Part 1: Theory & management & ISP routing, as well as current events in
the IPv6 realm. For example, did you know that Nortel just sold
Microsoft a huge chunk of IPv4 legacy addresses for something like 7
million dollars? This has really turned the tables on the game. Up until
that happened the thought in the community was that the large ISP's
would be the biggest pushers of IPv6 deployment. But this is an early
indicator of what's going to happen. The large ISPs are going to spend
millions in vacuuming every scrap of IPv4 out of all the corners on the
Internet before they will start pushing their users to go to IPv6. That
is a serious problem for any small ISP that does not have a stock of
IPv4 because they will be run out of numbers and new customers will not
be interested in their IPv6 offerings as long as the large ISPs still
are handing IPv4 out.

And I already have five personal /48's, and one /48 for my company.

Seriously, there's enough space to give every *individual* who will
likely ever need more than one segment their own /56 (for 65536
segments :), and they're still handing out /48's left and right.

I suspect broadband-to-home will be handing out /56 by default, and
it'll be trivial for Portland Telco to get a /48, so that they can
allocate /56's to each of *their* end nodes for multi-segments.

Yeah, exactly.  The special clause is kind of useless for our
topology.  We can solve the problem ourselves without it (although a
little more proactivity by local ISPs would be nice).  It was pleasant
that people thought about us.  I think I even participated in lobbying
for that clause in a tangential way.

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=5KbH8J-gvUEY_1dz-kH5j1pzBZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Have people had problems with Virtual Box on openSuSE or other Linux?
Or have I simply screwed something up with my particular installation
of Virtual Box?

I originally used Virtual Box with Windows 7 as the host OS and was
able to install and run most any OS I wanted including openSuSE,
Fedora, Ubuntu, several different versions of Knoppix, PC-BSD, and
openSolaris with few problems.

Now that I'm using openSuSE 11.3 as the host OS, I have been able to
install a good working version of Windows XP, but seem to have major
problems installing and running other OSs.  I may have been successful
with Ubuntu, and haven't tried openSuSE or Fedora; but have major
problems using Knoppix and PC-BSD.

Are problems like this common with virtual box in Linux?

I'm short on time and almost ready to go back to VM-Ware server which
has served me well over the years.

David,

I had to abandon virtual box on Ubuntu because I ran into some serious 
issues early on. Could barely get through a Windows Server install, and 
accessing the machine was very slow.

I used vmware server on Ubuntu but it's no longer supported. I finally 
settled on KVM.

Have you tried KVM? I've been using it successfully without issues for 
about a year. I find it very intuitive and easy to build, copy, and 
maintain images on the command line.

Here's a shell script (some details elided) I used to install Windows 
XP as a KVM-hosted VM:

virt-install \
   --name="WinVM" --ram="2048" --vcpus="2" \
   --os-type="windows" \
   --network="bridge:br0" --mac="54:52:00:XX:YY:ZZ" \
   --disk="path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/WinVM.dsk,size=30"\
   --cdrom="/usr/local/src/winxp-sp3.iso" \
   --vnc --hvm --accelerate

You'll need to update the various options for your local setup, of 
course, but otherwise it's a straightforward process.

You'll get a VNC window for the installer GUI...

i haven't had any problems on Ubuntu 7.x through 10.10, installing Win 
XP and 7 guests as well as transporting disk images from other host 
systems and migrating older configurations, using bridge and NAT 
networking setups. But, in all fairness, i haven't had to mess with any 
of the server editions of Windows.

I recently took a networking class and successfully installed Windows Server
2008, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Fedora 13 and Ubuntu 10.04.  All
without issues.
I was using Kubuntu 10.10 as the host.
Which version of VB are you using? Version 4 has made a lot of changes that
make it easier to use and to backup and export VMs.
If you post the settings you are using for your VM, I will happily try to
copy them on my machine and see if I run into any issues.

With KVM, it's so convenient to be able to start a VM from the command
line, e.g. the following boots the noted system --

virsh start server1.example.com

When networking is configured to start normally, you can connect to it
with SSH like any other remote system.

Thanks,
Mike

How about a virtual serial console for choosing a kernel to boot and
watching the boot messages?

That would be very useful for remote servers acting as hosts.

It's been a while since I used it, but kvm (qemu) also has a VNC
console setting which could accomplish this same thing.  This is
similar to VMWare's RemoteDisplay.vnc.* configuration to give you
simple remote access to the VM console.

Nice.  How do you connect to it?

I have set up VirtualBox to redirect the virtual serial console to a
named pipe and then point minicom to the named pipe.

These are all functions of the libvirt stack which while it works w/
several VM backends, but is commonly used w/ KVM:
http://libvirt.org/

virt-manager (GUI for managing VMs, VNC display of console)
virsh (interactive shell and scriptable mgmt tool)

So KVM doesn't really have a GUI, but libvirt does. I can't say enough
good things about libvirt.

One place that VirtualBox seems to beat KVM (as of when I was
researching 6 months ago) and that was USB pass-through.  That is,
Linux Host (of course), but you need access to a USB device from the
guest OS.  VirtualBox does this.  KVM as of 6 months ago kind of did
it but only for USBv1 devices.  I don't think I even *have* and USBv1
devices.  So, for desktop applications, VirtualBox still has some
advantages (unless I'm missing something).

Subject: [PLUG] Need DLL help to get a Windows program working with WINE
Message-ID: <1303485874.12433.41.camel@Maui>

Folks,

I've been trying to get some Windows-only test software working on RHEL
6 for a client, but it borks out with an 

OLE Error 80040514

Can't get them onto Linux test software due to contracts. 

What I see online suggests that if I know what DLLs that program uses, I
can get winetricks to load them (or at least clones) with WINE to
address the error. 

What I don't know is how to figure out what DLLs are used by this
Windows piece of (@!#t) software. Or perhaps there's some standard
setting with winetricks that can help. 

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: [PLUG] Solarized Color Scheme - Xresources
Message-ID: <20110422152639.GA2577@jamhome.us>

I've been trying to implement the Solarized terminal color schemes on my system with limited success.
Information on Solarized:  http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized

My laptop is running Kubutu with Xorg package version 1:7.5.  I've copied the provided Xresources file to ~/.Xresources

The perceived problem is the the background isn't being set to the proper light or dark settings.

I've not had cause to modify X color defaults before.  So I don't know where to go to fix this.  

Has anyone here successfully implemeted the Solarized color settings?
What suggestions do you have for bending X to my will?

Yup, KVM still seems to be a work in progress. For example, KVM uses USB
1.1 for a touchpad passthrough for me.

In addition, it's a bit weird to have to use virsh destroy servername
(instead of a simple shutdown).

Nevertheless, I feel more confident knowing that KVM (with libvirt
stuff) is native to various Linux distros, and doesn't have the
weirdness of that specialized Xen kernel.

Thanks,
Mike

You might be able to get the list by running:
  objdump -x myprog.exe

Alternatively, if you run the program under a debugger in windows
(free/easy: ollydbg) you should be able to see all of the executable
modules (dlls, exes) loaded.  I'm sure there are easier ways in
Windows, but I haven't done serious Win dev in a long time.

There are Windows tools for this job. I used one a couple of 
years back and it was easy to use. Evidently no longer on my system.

A couple stabs via Google turned up

    and
http://dev.depeuter.org/xptruss.php

Have you installed Jet 4.0 and MDAC 2.8?  I'll bet the program was written
in VB6 and/or Access, look for Wine help along those lines.

I don't know if you can reveal what the test software is, but it'd be nifty
to know.  I've done some testing in my time...

Good luck with the Linux-ification,

Subject: [PLUG] Apache or PHP configuration problem
Message-ID: <4DB20D1A.5040901@comcast.net>

I have Apache and php running on my Ubuntu desktop machine. I just 
installed Apache 2.2.17 and php 5.2.17 on my XP laptop (I used the .msi 
installers for each, and then tweaked the Apache httpd.conf file to fix 
path errors caused by the php installer). I expected that I would be 
able to copy a directory from /var/www from my desktop to my laptop and 
have it look the same. For some reason, images and css don't appear to 
be working on my new XP installation.

I know php is working because I can display phpinfo, and when pointing 
to localhost, index.php opens correctly.

So, is this an Apache configuration problem, a php configuration 
problem, or something else?

Googling tells me that the file mime.types needs to have a line saying

text/css                                css

I have that.

Any other ideas?

Thanks.

Works for me:

yes

$ EBS="/net/dbvolx"

$ if [ "${EBS}" == "/net/dbvol" ]; then echo yes ;else echo no ; fi
no

I suspect the error is elsewhere.

What do your apache logs say?
Could it be an issue with the end-of-line character?
If you create this file on XP, does it render correctly?
  <html><body>Hello</body></html>
If you creat that file on linux and copy it over, does it render correctly?
Do something similar with a simple php and css file.

Works for me here, too.  Here's what my bash has to say for itself
$ bash --version
GNU bash, version 4.1.7(1)-release (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu)

According to the bash man page, "==" is both an arithmetic and
a string equivalence operator.

Making it a single equal sign resolved the issue. 

I am using bash 4.1.5 on Ubuntu 10.04.

After some trial and error, I've got the test software working. I'm now
pretty sure it's something silly like flash or java (which of course
also has to be installed/enabled via WINE, d'oh!), gotta test the result
on a different VM. 

Appreciate everyone's help!

There were previous discussions about the possibility that I could
give a talk on Scribus. I'm not sure I made it clear that my decision
was not to go to LinuxFest Northwest.

That is the correct and portable method.  Remember that [ is an alias 
for 'test' and 'test' specifies a single equal for string equality. 
Bash may have a built in test, I haven't checked, just use the common 
'test' semantics.

Regarding the problem of web pages that work on my Linux install of 
Apache and php, but not on my XP install of Apache and php:

It was too nice a day to be indoors, so I didn't get to do any testing 
until this evening.

I created simple files with a line of text and an image. I found that I 
can display images as plain html files, or from php files served by 
Apache on my XP installation. I can also introduce css. All I did for 
that was to create a style to set the background of the body. I applied 
it to an html file, and to my index.php file. The background changed on 
both of them.

So, from that it appears that Apache and php are working.

Next question: is there a "strict" kind of setting in Apache? I wonder 
if the site that works on my Linux machine and also when served from 
SpiritOne's server is somehow not "strict" and that I have errors that 
don't show up there, but show up on my fresh XP installation of Apache 
and php. Also, I'm guessing that apache is where the problem lies, and I 
probably don't have a problem with php.

if you check the source of the rendered page (i.e. via your browser), 
are the missing page resources actually where the browser's being told 
they are? is that location within your doc root?

if it works on new pages you create, maybe it's the old pages that are 
the problem, such as... absolute url references instead of relative?

just throwin' ideas around here.

Yes.

On my Ubuntu machine DocumentRoot is /var/www/

On my XP machine DocumentRoot is D:\Server\www\public_html

I have an index.php in DocumentRoot on each machine and link to 
index.php pages in various projects that are in their own directories in 
DocumentRoot. I copied the directory in question from DocumentRoot on my 
Ubuntu machine to DocumentRoot on my XP machine without making any changes.

I'm guessing it probably is a problem with the old pages, but not 
absolute vs. relative references. If I take the first <img> tag on the 
site, put it in a file called image-test.html, with <html> and <body> 
tags around it and open it in Firefox, it displays correctly. I didn't 
change anything inside the <img> tag.

Tomorrow I'll start building the problem site's index.php, one piece at 
a time, and see what's causing the trouble.

> just throwin' ideas around here.

I appreciate them. Even if they're not directly the answer, they help 
lead me to what is.

The link I created in my DocumentRoot's index.php looked like this:

Why I included index.php/ after testing/, I can't explain. However, 
after correcting it to:

<a href="testing/">Test Site</a>

everything works as expected. Just out of practice, I guess.

Note that in Ubuntu and Debian, /bin/sh is dash, not bash, which is
more strict in its posix sh(1) conformance ('==' for string comparisons
is a bashism). Login shells by default use bash, but shell scripts,
unless explicitly using bash via "#!/bin/bash" will by default be
interpreted by dash.

The checkbashisms script from the devscripts package on Debian and
Ubuntu will highlight issues for you.

I did not know that: "Debian Almquist shell (dash) is a Unix shell,
much smaller than bash but still aiming at POSIX-compliancy. It
requires less disk space but is also less feature-rich."

You can also include "set -o posix" toward the top of your bash 
scripts to help enforce POSIX compliance.

i was going to suggest that it might run faster if you set it on fire first.
given that the author has a page like this http://analytic.tripod.com/id20.htm
on his website, i'm guessing/hoping/praying it's a joke.

add a newline after the search string). I'm drawing a total blank on how to
write the replace regex and need a clue stick.

I'm not sure how to reference the entire search string, but you can
reference subsets with escaped parens.  To get around some difficult
notation issues, here's how you tack "foo" onto the end of ABCD:

query for: \(ABCD\)
replace with: \1foo

In general, things in parens can be referenced by \N where N increases
as you encounter open parens from the left-side of the search string.

Rogan,

   That does not look familiar, but trying it didn't work for me. Yes, the
string is parentheses was replaced, but the dollar sign was then added
rather than a \newline. Must be something I did wrong.

Thanks,

Rogan,

   The built-in emacs info page on regex replacement shows that \& replaces
the entire search string. Unfortunately, when I try \&$ or \& $ I don't get
a \newline but the dollar sign. Any thoughts on why?

I believe that $ just matches end-of-line.  Inserting a new-line is
trickier (which is why my example used 'foo' instead.)  I think you
can get a newline character with: C-q <enter>, which should leave you
with a single character that looks like ^M.

   Apparently, it's C-q C-j, but I'm not sure how to correctly enter these.
The ^M is the DOS end-of-line; in emacs the result should be the following
text moves to the beginning of the next line. I'm still searching.

Thanks,

Rogan,

   Aha! For the replacement string I put in the text I want to retain and
follow that with Ctrl-q/Ctrl-j (using the Ctrl key, not a symbol for it) and
off emacs goes. Works.

I do this in vi all the time. It shows a ^M in the search/replace string,
but not in the actual text that got modified.

^M shows at newlines in the text when viewing DOS-formatted files in Linux.
This is a separate, unrelated thing.

Wes,

   Turns out that ^M is also the Mac end-of-line visibly rendered in a pager.
In emacs I discovered that the original file came from a Mac, not a Windows
box (which was my assumption). Converting the line terminator from Mac to
linux was a simple:

 	tr "\r" "\n" < inputfile > outputfile

no need to futz with it in emacs at all. :-)

   Now I need to learn how to use split() in awk to reformat the date field
from mm/dd/yy to YYYY-MM-DD. Discussion starts on page 190 of the ORA
sed/awk book.

It just crashed. (WINE can run unprivileged, as I did in this case, so I doubt

i was going to suggest that it might run faster if you set it on fire first.
given that the author has a page like this http://analytic.tripod.com/id20.htm
on his website, i'm guessing/hoping/praying it's a joke.

Subject: [PLUG] Favorite Linux Netbook specific distro?
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=PTht6Giob+ydCpLxhSWDvAWkN1w@mail.gmail.com>

I'm going to purchase my first Netbook this week. What's your fav
Linux Netbook specific OS and why?

I plan to check out Jolicloud, gOS, OpenGeeeU, CrunchEee, and maybe
Meego. I currently rung Debian Squeeze (KDE4) on my Lenovo T60 so I'm
kind of keen on the full-fledge desktop experience even though I
really don't need it nor take advantage of it.

Also, I wonder how many people show up at the PLUG Linux Clinic w.
Netbooks and get help with Nebook specific OS problems?

Thanks in advance for your comments, recommendations, feedback.

Mike

Yes most likely the fact that you were trying to run it in WINE instead of
an actual Windoze environment saved you some headaches from cleaning out
malware/nagware/etc.
IMHO stuff that is As Seen On TV! (tm) as far as computer programs go, is
next to worthless (unless you are watching an actual tech review show kind
of thing, not an ad).

Besides you are already taking a good step to speed up your computer- you
are running Linux instead of Windows.... ;)

I use Fedora plus a kernel, instructions, a utilities from 
http://www.fedora-netbook.com/

Still using Fedora 12 on my ASUS Eeepc.  Works quite well so haven't 
been worried about getting the latest and greatest.

i don't need a netbook specific OS for my netbook (i use stock
xubuntu, and pare down the list of running processes judiciously.
don't need cron if you run updatedb manually on occasion,
frinstance.).

then again, i also bend the fabric of time and space and do crazy
things like run two-three virtual machines simultaneously on it while
still using the console interactively.  it isn't awesome, but neither
is it terrible.

i did try out the netbook remix of ubuntu, but as a 20-year veteran of
the X window System who has his setup pretty tweaked, their little gui
immediately turned me off.

can't recommend gnome or kde on the thing, though.  i use xfce4 or
ratpoison depending on my mood.

Message-ID: <FBF7E8F888BA4BDB816CF11E5021A846@qlaptop2>

Hello,

We're building a wireless 3G IP camera system that will FTP a large 
(2.5Mbyte) 10 megapixel jpeg image every 30 minutes to a remote server, for 
use in a time-lapse image application. Using a cron job, we pull the image 
from the attached IP cam via curl http://<local cam IP address>/img.jpg 
 >/tmp/image.jpg, and then FTP it to the remote server. This works fine when 
the 3G connection is working well (around 300-400K upload bandwidth). But 
when the 3G connection slows to a crawl, which happens multiple time each 
day, the FTP transfer hangs or times out.

I tested a script that uses split to divide the 2.5Mbyte image into smaller 
50k chunks, which are individually ftp'd, then reassembled at the server 
using cat. This works but will require a fair amount of experimentation and 
additional code to make it reasonably robust to deal with missing files, 
slowdowns, timeouts, retries, etc. etc. My question - is there a better 
apporoach or code out there (for a bare-bones slack 2.4.23 environment) that 
would automate this process and reliably handle the transfer of the large 
file to the remote server under erratic bandwidth conditions?

Thanks,

Tom S.

I looked at some Netbook versions, like the netbook version of Ubuntu
and EasyPeasy, etc. but I found the interfaces horrible and
unfamiliar, so I installed a standard desktop version of Ubuntu
instead.  They seem to work fine.

Give rsync a try. If you don't want the overhead of SSL I believe you
can still have rsync use the
r commands for the transfer. Can't remember been a long time.

Rsync options can also take care of the file's deletion when
successfully transfered. As a success
check may want to look at the option for rsync to use a checksum vs
just the filesize.

A question tho' does each file have a unique name ? If not after 30
seconds a reattempt could
delete the previous file.

No software is going to make your 3G network not suck, but have you
tried scp or rsync?

Well that's interesting.? Is this all on one 3G network or multiple
carriers?? Are the 3G slowdowns consistent with respect to time of day?? Do
you you have multiple camera points?
Please tell more.

I use the 64bit version of Kubuntu on my netbook.  It has the option of the
Netbook or Desktop interface and you can change back and forth as you
please.  I usually stick with the standard desktop and have no issues.  I
only make a few tweaks to reduce the amount of disk writing it does and it
works quite nicely.  I have found that if I use an encrypted home directory,
it is slower to boot but most other things work at normal speed.  I also
manage to get about 7 hours of use on a charge.

I believe this is a problem with all carriers altho we use Verizon. Basic issue is competition with cellphones and that's a big problem esp. during rush hour. Throughout the day, we've measured upload speeds as high as 450kbs and as low as 8kbs. 

We do have a number of these systems out there (not with 10mp cams tho) and this problem shows up anytime you're in an urban or suburban area. Performance is actually much better in rural areas (if you can get a signal), presumably because there's not as much cellphone traffic.

Have not tried rsync. Scp at first suceeds in sending about 15% of the file, 
then stalls and eventually times out the same way as FTP. Not sure why but 
it may be that during times of poor bandwidth verizon limits the amount of 
data you can send in one session (?)

Subject: [PLUG] rsync
Message-ID: <4DB867DF.2080408@gmail.com>

All,

I have been playing around with rsync getting ready to upgrade to 
Natty.  I have an encrypted /home and some reading suggests that 
occasional failures happen to the home partition during installation.

I put together a script sometime back and the external hard drive is now 
full.  Have deleted some old backups that weren't necessary to make some 
room.  Looking at the logfile...some adjustments are in order.

The question is which of the dot files are really necessary to keep, and 
will it save much room if they are not copied?

Thanks,

Bruce

If you do, get the options right: include '--partial' or rsync will
*delete* the incomplete file, not retain or resume it.

Hmm, as many people don't seem to feel the need to run a netbook
specific distro it makes me wonder what if any
real benefit is? Maybe their geared more towards ARM based hardware?
Maybe just have simpler, web browser type
interfaces for a broader user base who won't be hacking, tweaking, and
running a lot of different apps? Or maybe they were just
over-engineered thinking that off the shelf netbook hw couldn't run a
standard distro well? Or maybe it's just marketing, a chance
for someone get their name out there amongst the 100s of Linux distros?

I've settled on the Toshiba NB series. In my research thus and the
only issus I've come across are with the Realtek NIC and touchpad
don't seem to
work out of the box on a few distros. From the threads I've read,
Realtek provides a Linux driver that works, but I didn't see anything
about the touchpad. Which
is fine, because I despise thouchpads. IBM won my heart with their
track-stick idea.

I will add in another data point, using regular Fedora 12 (at the moment) on
an Acer Aspire 110.
It works fine, can be a little slow for some things, but it is certainly
quite usable.  My wife currently using it for her daily driver (which is why
I haven't updated it).
She mostly uses OpenOffice and web/email.

My only real problem with this particular netbook was the 512MB RAM module
is soldered on the mobo, thus you can only upgrade to 1.5GB RAM and not
2.0GB.
At any rate it has been chugging along happily with a regular distro, I
think I pared it down a little bit, but noticed it worked fine even with
GNOME (after upgrading the RAM though).

browser (and acrobat reader) cache are typically my biggest "hidden"
files.  here's how you can tell what's worth investigating/pruning:

cd ; du -sk .??* | sort -n

personally speaking, i don't have enough in there to think about
compared to the size of the rest of my homedir (300M:46GB)--and this
home directory is 11 years old ( => lots of stale old dotfiles i could
probably prune if i cared enough).

but then i also have most apps' cache sizes dialed down pretty low and
did once scrub the acrobat cache dir manually.

dotfiles used to be mostly config files.  and they still are, though
gnome's config file directory is bigger than my entire home directory
was for quite some time.  funny, since i don't even use gnome (but do
use some apps that use that framework under the hood, i guess, since
the config files are there and recently modified).

Hi folks, 

not sure if others are subscribed to the ubuntu-us-or list, but there's gonna be
a shindig on Saturday at Backspace in downtown PDX for the Natty release.

more info at:

http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/team/924/detail/

as a heads up if you can make it, they may be trying to charge cover at the
door, but just tell them you're with Ubuntu Oregon and you can get in for free.

hope to see you there!

nathan w

note: this may belong on plug-announce but i wasn't sure if that list is
strictly for plug events.

Thanks Chris,

That provided some more insight.
The other thing that is working, the longer I look at the list, the less 
I see that I think I really need.  Most of them can be built new by the 
new install.

With the rsync hardlink option, and the huge hard disks available
these days, you can save thousands of daily snapshots on a hard
disk.  The dot files take up almost no room, compared to the log
files and the big data files I create.  I can typically get a
year of daily images from 6 machines on a $80 2 terabyte disk
(using the "dirvish" application, written by a friend and hosted
on my server).

Besides personal files, the dot files are probably the most
important files on your system.  They contain a lot of
personalization information.  After an unfortunate glibc
upgrade, my .gnome2 and .metacity files got mangled by a
misbehaving desktop, and the daily backups were important 
ways of finding out what went wrong, and the source of the
most recent working versions of these dot directories.

The browser cache is in .mozilla .  I haven't looked, but
that is probably the biggest user of dot file space.  You
might want to investigate, perhaps add that to your rsync
--exclude-from= file.  Don't save that pr0n where the cops
can find it!  Let us know what you figure out about that.

Keith,

Thanks.  I knew they were the config files.  Just wondered if there were 
some more important than the others.  I just remembered I am working 
with a 60G partition and have been backing up 3 machines for a number of 
years.  A new external HD is seriously in order.

Not to worry about the pr0n...it is buried well...I myself will never 
find it!!

there was a discussion earlier on the ubuntu loco mailing list about adding to
calagator. if it hasn't been done yet i'll update it tonite. as for the notice
on the backspace site... dunno, but i talked to them today and they're aware
we're coming.

Hey!  New to the mailing list, but figured I would submit another data
point for your consideration.

I've been switching back and forth between Ubuntu 10.04 and Archlinux
on a Dell Mini for the past year, with one of the early Atoms and 1GB
of RAM.  This thing has soldiered on like a champ, and really haven't
noticed any slowdown running the full GNOME environment.  In fact, I

Thanks for the tip on Arch! I tried it a few years back and I couldn't
get it to boot on my IBM T60. I was
a bit disappointed as it seemed to be a potentially great distro. It's
also now listed in the top 10 distros on
distrowatch.com and has gotten some very good reviews as well. It's on
the list of distros to try out.

If anyone who regularly attends the PLUG Sunday Linux Clinics is
reading this thread, I'd be curious to know how
many people are showing up with netbooks and asking about some of the
more obscure distros like Arch. It's always fun to sit
at home and play around w. different distros, it might be more fun to
have a "netbook nerd" day to be able to check out what other
people are running, talk shop, eat penquinos, and drink coffee. :-)

I have been running Ubuntu on my ASUS EEEPC 1000.  It's snappy even
with GNOME Desktop.

I no longer have a netbook, but when I did I tried several distros on it 
(Asus eeePC 701).  The ones that ran best were Cruncheee, Puppeee, 
Salix, Peppermint, and Linux Mint XFCE edition.

I've been mulling the decision on a netbook ever since the first eee
pc came out. What I really want is a true hand-held computing device
like that of the Nokia N810 or the Toshiba Libretto W100
(http://us.toshiba.com/computers/laptops/libretto), which had really
great promise I thought, especially the 3G or WiMax versions. But UMPC
/ MID devices are 3 to 4 times
the price of most netbooks. IMHO, a 4" Android phone is just a bit too
small and battery life too short for true mobile computing and 10"
netbooks are still a bit too big and heavy to carry around, use in
your hands and for phone calls. <sigh>

I go to most of the clinics, and I've pretty much only seen people trying to
get Ubuntu to work on netbooks. I've seen perhaps 5-10 netbooks show up
there so far.

surprised no-one has mentioned jolicloud. i haven't used it personally, 
but it's apparently very popular, and all the reviews i've seen speak 
well of it. (i believe it's ubuntu-derived)

To be honest I'm a bit skeptical of the cloud, unless I'm the one hosting my
own cloud.

Any distro should work fine enough on a netbook, I think it's just a matter
of manually tweaking it to your performance tastes. I've had good
experiences with debian squeeze running xfce4, it doesn't take up a lot of
space and it doesn't suck up as much power as KDE or GNOME.

Message-ID: <20110428192058.44ab178d@mailhost.pdx.edu>

As has been mentioned here recently, today, April 28, is the release
date for Natty Narwhal, Ubuntu 11.04. I have downloaded the Alternate,
Desktop and Server of the Ubuntu live CDs, 32- and 64-bit. I have also
downloaded Kubuntu Alternate and Desktop (there is no server version) in
32- and 64-bit CDs.

I will also download the Natty versions of Xubuntu and Lubuntu as soon
as they are available. Ditto for the Ubuntu Netbook, as well as
Edubuntu and the multimedia remix. 

If you want a CD and don't have or want to spend the bandwidth to
download it yourself, just holler and I'll burn you one. 

I maintain the last several versions of Ubuntu, and at least the latest
versions of Fedora, ArchLinux, CentOS, DSL, Gentoo, Knoppix, Mint,
OpenSuse, Slackware, Puppy and Slax, as well as several varieties of
rescue CDs and utility disks.

I installed Natty on an Eeepc netbook this morning for one of the 
engineers at work. The Eee had Windows on the HD. The installer shrunk 
the NTFS partition to half the disk and installed Natty on the other 
half. Both Windows and Linux work as expected. The Linux environment 
correctly configured the wireless, audio, and the built-in webcam.

The default destop feels like the old netbook-spin desktop. It's not 
really my favorite, but it's pretty attractive and its operation is 
easy enough to grok.

   For the record, yesterday was the official release date for
Slackware-13.37.

   So there. :-)

Making it hard to find and re-enable the "old style" desktop, so that
people can be functional, is a pain-in-the-butt.  I really don't like
the computer-as-uncomfortably-large-smartphone idea.  Wrong direction.

It would have made more of an impression on me had I not been working 
with an Eeepc, which *is* just an uncomfortably large smartphone. :-)

I typically install Ubuntu only on laptops; its firmware support for 
wireless devices is (imo) ridiculously good. Desktops and servers get 
Debian or CentOS (or, occasionally, Fedora).

As it happens, I am typing this on an EEEpc 701 4G with ubuntu 11.04
(there are parts that overflowed onto an SD card).  I did manage to
find and reselect the Classic Desktop, so it is reasonable comfortable
again.  What I read about future intentions, though, gives me
considerabe pause about the future of Ubuntu.

Yeah, I finally buckled as more and more devices started showing up
(family laptops, family desktops) that I didn't want to have to pay so
much attention to.  Ubuntu has historically given a pleasant
out-of-the-box experience for non-nerds.  Maybe Unity would be fine
for a non-nerd, but ... when they ask *me* about something, it would
be nice to know the answer.  I can't see myself using that thing
enough to know the answer.

I have been playing with Natty since Alpha 2.  I have come very close to 
giving up on Ubuntu several times, because, I assume this to be the 
future of Ubuntu.

One evening, a young friend showed up and looking over my shoulder he said,
"WOW, THAT'S COOL!!"
"What is it?"

I continue to tinker so I will know what's where when the inevitable 
question arise about it.

Did I say that I wasn't real fond of it at first?

Thanks for the update.

I have downloaded 13.37 32- and 64-bit DVDs.

I want to keep the latest version of popular distros, but it is hard to
keep up to date.

Huh, I hadn't heard of "Unity", but then again I don't run Ubuntu. So
I looked it up
and came across this interesting forum post entitled: Default Desktop

I wonder how much different the reactions would be if you took a
similar group and gave them a Gnome desktop, or KDE, or whatever.

I suspect the results would be about the same, but it would be
interesting to see an experiment.

Probably. We all work differently in a UI that gives us that option. I
didn't like really like the Linux UI
on the first few distros I tried as it was Gnome. Then when I started
running the KDE versions of distros, I stopped using MS Win.
So a lot of it is just personal preference in how the UI feels to you
and how you move about and do things in it.

There are people out there who just want a window manager. I tried it
a few times and it was okay, but after a few days I went back
to KDE. And I honestly don't do anything to the default KDE. I just
install the distro and start using it. Maybe that's why I like it so
much.
I'm not a hot-key guy and I still like my trackball.

I am having issues with Natty.

Neither the Home key nor the Windows (meta) key works as advertised.
In fact a lot of the "short cut" keys to not seem to function.
I have even tried plugging in a second keyboard.  No joy.

I do not seem to have a way to get the launcher.
Yes, I can get a command window (cntl+alt+T), but the whole point of a GUI is to not need
the command line.

Anyone else seen these issues ?

Sorry to hear that, Bill.  I have not experienced any keyboard issues.  
Most of the keyboard shortcuts I try, just work.

Subject: [PLUG] question on NAND solid state drives lifetime
Message-ID: <BANLkTikGxebOn66Uhr6=tBWUgVnsMy+t1A@mail.gmail.com>

While I understand that solid state drives considerably speed things
up on the motherboard, others have discouraged me from purchasing
such, stating that the NAND technology only permits a limited number
of writes.

My applications are number theory processing and image fft analysis,
so will my system eventually fall victim to the limited write cycles
of the NAND solid state drives?  I do hammer files continuously
sometimes.

Does anyone have some experience with ssd?

The newer drives (particularly Intel and OCZ) look very promising... but ???

SSD's Do have a limited number of writes. That number is pretty high, but
there is a limit. SSD's really shine in Read Mode and can have read times
10x of a spinning drive. writes are faster too, maybe (3x or so ).

I don't know how in Linux or even if you can, but on some of the servers I
work we can pin files into memory that we know are going to get high usage
and then flush them to disk when we are done.  I have a client that does
this, course they have 256GB of memory to do it in :)
