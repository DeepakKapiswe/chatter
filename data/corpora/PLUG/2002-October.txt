Message-ID: <1033455764.7592.5.camel@zontar.clueserver.org>

The discs are mislabeled in the installer. disc 1 is actually the "play
disc". Disc 2 is actually disc 1. Disc 3 is actually disc 2.  The
installer for Linux is on the last disc. (Marked disc 3, but the
installer calls it disc 2.)

The controls are not what I am used to. It is going to take some time. 
High resolutions are not always the best as the deatil can overwhelm
your targets.

You will probably need an nVidia AGP card as well as the closed source
nVidia drivers to play the game.  (Along with a big beefy machine.)

So far, I can play the game with full detail cranked up and it works
fine.  But I am using a dual Athalon 2100+ MP system with 512M and an
nVidia card with 64 megs of ram. Your millage may vary.

Though it has been giving me some headaches, the newer 2.4 kernels include
some complex facilities for bandwidth management.  Using these along with
iptables (for selection of traffic types and/or machines whose bandwidth
you want to regulate), you should be able to setup pretty much anything
you like, then just run a shell script from a crontab at 12:00 and 1:00 to
make the necessary policy changes.  These facilities are part of the
current iproute software package in recent versions of linux, the
"tc" and "ip" commands are the primary ones of interest, but be warned
that the documentation sucks, and much is not documented at all.
There is however a web site which provides a great deal more info,
though it still hasn't solved my problems :-(   See:

   www.lartc.org

for more information.

Ah ha!  When I ctrl-esc to get the wmaker menu for gkrellm and add
omnipresence, CPU jumps up to 90's.  Take off omnipresent and it goes
back down to normal.

Report this problem to WindowMaker crew?  Gkrellm author? XFree86?  All

I'm now glad that Gnapster went dead, because it induced me to find
better software for the same purpose.  I haven't tried gift yet, but
LimeWire is meeting my needs.  It's the best example of java I've seen
yet.

I think something's happens to the OpenNap server system since Gnapster
and lopster (I think) both use this.  LimeWire is on Gnutella and thus
isn't affected.  No mention of any of this on any web searches I've
done, except I read a very general article somewhere about how the
recording industry is using software to attempt to block the online
sharing of their property.  just a guess...

that file linux.bin is no good for booting. I even tried running

  In postfix's header_checks, you can use 'i' after the final slash in the
regex. This changes the default, case-sensitive checks to case insensitive.

Here's a review with a nice tip.

http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=1842&page=all

"There is this new feature coming with RH8 that you create a directory
called ~/.fonts and you throw in all your TTF fonts in there, and they get
recognized automatically from the system!......Too bad that
OOo(OpenOffice.org) does not recognize the TTF fonts I installed on my
~/.fonts dir, though. Other GTK+ application can't see them either, eg.
gedit, while other can (eg.  Gnome2 Terminal). This is an incosintency
issue and, in my opinion, it should be fixed."

I'll have to see how well it works.

Just the Gkrellm author, since there is no evidence (at this point) that
it is a problem with WindowMaker and/or XFree86, and I'm sure they have
enough bugs of their own to deal with.  The author of Gkrellm can push the
bug report up stream if it turns out not to be their problem.  Have you
checked to see if this is already a known bug?  A fix might already be
available.

This machine is totally up to date as far as Red Hat Network, which means 
openssl-0.9.6b-28.

I have read most of the threads in here on Slapper and I surmised that RH

<rant>that rule sucks</rant>

>From the question, I'm assuming that "our Linux Server" is "our Linux Firewall".

You'll need to/could:

	segregate the people allowed full access and noon-time access into
	  differing IP address pools

	have a rule early in the FORWARD set that defines access for the 
	  group with limited access

	use cron to modify the rule at noon and 1:00pm


This could be as simple as

	iptables -R FORWARD <RULENUM> <RULESPEC> {-j ALLOW or DENY depending on time}

This is how I got it to work.  When installing Linux I used grub as the boot
loader.
Let every thing go by default except that you have to put a label on the nt
partition
or grub will not see it.  To do this at install time when it shows the boot loader
options
at the bottom of the screen it will list the different partitions and a check mark
on the
default boot partition.  Select the nt/dos partition and the above this line you
can
put in the label name.

Hope this helps

We're working with Michael now in #orlug to see if we can determine

How exactly do you conclude that the Red Hat updates fail to fix this
vulnerability?  Could it be possible that somehow the machines were
infected prior to the update?  Do you have documentation that states that
the Red Hat fix is not enough?

Thank you

OK, so before I scouring my systems, could you just assure me that

a) you don't have any services running that were statically linked 
   against older, vulnerable openssl libs

b) that you restarted all ssl-enabled services (web, mail, whatever) 
   after you updated to the latest openssl rpm

wget is a handy tool to know of. The -m switch makes it mirror the site you
specify, following links. This doesn't work with many dynamic-content sites
however (wget sees the page "hey, this is a new version!" grabs it,
eventually finds a link back to the top, queries the server for the page,
sees it, "Hey, this is a new version!" grabs it...")

Just doing wget <url> will pull just that url down the pipe. 

A useful thing to do would be to bind a key to a script that cd's to a
predefined downloads dir and runs wget on whatever is in the clipboard.

As is curl, which supports a ton of protocols: http, https, ftp, 
gopher, dict, telnet (!), ldap, or even file. It even can handle 
cookies. Sadly, however, I don't think it has the equivalent of wget's 
--mirror option.

Keith:

	Not to rub your nose in it, at all, but (for me) this is 
where firewalls come in very handy. I made the usual modifications to 
httpd.conf and checked /tmp for signs, then made changes to my 
firewall (appliance) configuration. Closed ALL incoming UDP ports, 
except 2.

	I'm "up2date" as well, but I try to think in "layers of 
security." I love my Netscreen(s), but I'm going to use iptables as 
well, when I finish my server upgrades in a couple of weeks.

	Sorry to hear about your problem. I certainly don't envy the 
damage control process. I can say that I've been there with similar 
issues in the past. I got suckered into trying WireX's "Immunix 7" 
and had so many problems that it felt like I owned an Windows NT box!

My server got slapped silly with the A variant about two weeks
ago, so I fixed it and updated my openssl RPM then. Since then my
server's logs show about 3-4 attacks per night -- but none have
got through since. A friend down the hall upgraded in time too,
but he forgot to restart httpd and he got "slapped" with the B
version the very next day. 

Seems to me, given the numerous (failed) attempts for slapper to
get into my machine lately, that the current RPM is okay as long
as you restart httpd. At least I hope so.

Here's what a successful attack looks like (in
/var/log/httpd/error_log):
[Thu Sep 12 15:43:11 2002] [error] [client 12.163.231.102] client

out (client 12.163.231.102, server www.gisnet.com:443)

(lots of SSL handshake timeout messages follow)

After the upgrade, here's what a failed attack looks like:
[Mon Sep 30 20:35:53 2002] [error] [client 211.133.188.52] client
sent HTTP/1.1 request without hostname (see RFC2616 section

Well, good questions. The openssl RPM updated on 13Aug02
Name        : openssl                      Relocations: (not relocateable)
Version     : 0.9.6b                            Vendor: Red Hat, Inc.
Install date: Tue 13 Aug 2002 08:56:41 AM PDT      Build Host: stripples.devel.redhat.com
Group       : System Environment/Libraries   Source RPM: 
openssl-0.9.6b-28.src.rpm

I don't know if the update restarted the daemon, I'll have to check. I 
don't have any documentation from Red Hat and am awaiting a reply from 
someone at rhn-users which I'll forward to the list.

I don't think so. The only rpms I have installed are openssl-0.9.6b-28 and 
openssl-devel-0.9.6b-28. There is only one piece of software on the system 
that isn't an RPM and that doesn't use SSL at all.

That I did not. I guess that is a standard procedure that I didn't know 
about. Does that mean that these other services keep a running copy for 
themselves, rather than hitting the (updated) library each time? Enlighten 
me on this :-)

What's the magic RPM invocation that will tell us all the services
that we need to restart?

Please, rub my nose, I have to learn it :-) Before I turn off all UDP, 
which ports have to be open? DNS needs 53, right?

This is good news and I hope that is what happened.

I know the recommended cure is a total rebuild but what are the steps to 
purge the system of this worm? I'll be pouring over the RPM verify output 
pretty quick here. I've deleted the files in /tmp and of course killed the 
.cinik process.

	Don't know for YOU, ... but for ME, I closed all UDP ports 
except DNS (53) and SMTP (25). I don't know what services you run on 
your box(-es), so I can't suggest anything - YMMV. At least one 
version of Slapper likes UDP port 2002. That door - and nearly 
everything else - is closed on my system(s).

	I've check /tmp several times. Grepped /var/log/messages(*) 
and so forth. I'm clean (knock wood).

	FWIW, I highly recommend Netscreen firewall appliances. I'm 
sure that some hard-core Linux heads will say that IPtables work just 
fine, and more power to them. I like a box OUTSIDE of my server(s) 
and the Netscreen(s) work just great - VPN, IPSec, etc. They're a 
bear to configure, but worth it!

	Hope that this helps.   ;-)

Keith,

  While I don't run httpd, I don't know of any package that restarts the
running daemon upon upgrade or freshen. I've always done this manually.

Because it's a complete compromise (i.e. they can run any code
they like on your system) the only sure cure is a complete
rebuild. But I think the risk vs cost to rebuild equation differs
depending on what's at risk. To me, I can afford to shut off my
one server for a few days while I scream and kick and chew the
rug trying to figure out how to repair the mess. Others may not
have that luxury and need to be able to show due diligence
towards their company's internet security. So I just pulled the
obvious teeth from the beastie and now watch my logs closer. So
far so good.

Here's some tips I collected for dealing with the A version (UDP
ports are different for the different versions, but for A they
are 2002.):

To look for your own IP in other people's firewall logs:
	http://dshield.org/warning_explanation.php
To check what other ports are open:
        $ netstat -an | grep -v ^unix
To see what process is bound to each port:
        # /usr/sbin/lsof -i -P |more

After de-fanging slapper, I had a lot of traffic on port 2002 at
first but it died off rapidly after I wasn't responding to the
infected zombie peers. AS long as you don't see your IP send out
messages (use tcpdump), you're okay and they'll leave you alone

As was discussed earlier, what probably happened is that I didn't restart 
the apache service after the RPM upgrade. Below is the response I got as 
well as a file to compile to test for the vulnerability.

Thanks for all the hints/tips/cluesticks.

Simply, this is completely untrue.

The most logical explanation as to the cause of the problem is that the 
server was not rebooted (as was suggested in the errata) or your apache 
otherwise restarted, and the ssl libraries unloaded. If you do not do this, 
simply updating on rhn will *not* secure your system.

Here's a file you can compile to test your servers for the vulnerability. 
Every one of our servers, from RH 6.2 to 7.3, was not vulnerable after 
adding the errata and rebooting to clear the libraries.

Check to see if you have openssl 0.9.5a installed as well. If you do,
this needs to be patched as well.

A competent C programmer could give you a more complete explanation...

What seems to happen is that when a process (e.g., httpd) is started, 
the linker maps into memory any dynamic libraries against which the 
process is linked (e.g., libssl.so) and then does magic so that the 
main process can find the library's routines in memory.

Once started, the process typically doesn't have anything to do with
the disk-based copy of itself or the libraries against which it's
linked.

So you can delete a program or its libraries out from underneath 
itself without affecting the running process.

The only way to pick up new, patched libraries it to restart the 
process.

The ultralinux.org link will give you pointers on the proper way to build
kernels on a sparc.  I don't think you use the make lilo/boot/zImage/bzImage
that you use on x86.  I think just "make" is all, and then copy the kernel
to the Right Place for silo to find it.  (It's been awhile.)

But does anyone know if they ever fixed the 2.4 kernel series to build on
sparc?  For ahwhile it was broke, and the vt.c header problem seems 
indicative of a generic kernel source for sparc issue as opposed to the
proper make incantation.

Check some spark lists and see if they ever got 2.4 properly ported to 
sparc.  I ran 2.2.18 'cause 2.4.x was broke so long.

Okay--so how did you get around the vt.c problem--just go to 2.4.18?  I take
it then 2.4.18 is now sparc-friendly?

While that may be true with RH-derivitives, Debian restarts just about 
everything (even pcmcia on a laptop getting sources from the network, 
grrr) when it upgrades.

IMHO, that's the way it SHOULD be, anyway.  Why upgrade if you're not 
going to start using the upgraded packages?

	You answered your own question with your "pcmcia" (sic) comment.  ;-)

	If the upgrade (process) only restarted daemons from upgraded 
applications, that would be fine and certainly prevent absent-minded 
omissions such as the one that Keith experienced. OTOH, if the 
upgrade ALWAYS restarted the entire box (server, workstation, 
whatever), then you'd have a Windows-like process that reboots every 
time you breath on it.

	Some people set up cron to run (Red Hat's) "up2date" at 
regular intervals (e.g. weekly). That kind of down time (for weekly 
reboots) would adversely impact a commercial server unless the admin 
was very careful about the timing of the upgrade. A 5 minute reboot, 
once a week, drops a server's uptime to less than 99%, annually (over 
4 hours/yr).

Hello Linux folkz,
Could somebody please recommend what FS should be used for
SQL database partition. I want to run MySQL DB on my server and it has
following options:
1. MySQL database can handle a raw device partition to store and
organize the data.
2. MySQL can store InnoDB table data in a large data files on the top
of existing FS.

Which method is more preferable and what journaling FS is more
suitable to handle large datafiles of 500 MB and may be more?

Thank you in advance

Alex

The downloadable demo is about 100 MB, and runs decently on my Athlon
1.2 Ghz with a cheapo Nvidia GF2MX video card after you turn down
some of the special effects in the game. A nice feature of the demo
is that you can play online.

As a side note, has anybody on the list managed to get some decent
OpenGL running on dual monitors at the same time using separate video
cards?

Hi Brian,

Thanks for your response

I have a remote K12LTSP server with "cygwin" installed.  I can connect it 
from a local
WinXP box (also installed with "cygwin") using the IP address of the 
server.  But WinXP could not access the server with its name.  Ping IP 
address of the server shows connection but not ping server's name (or its 
aliases).  I need to find out whether DNS is running on the server and 
configured properly.


I did following tests

(Remark: IP address of server:-  192.168.0.254
                name of server:-  server.ltsp      aliases:-  ltsp
from  "network")


On the server as root

# ps -ef|grep bind
root 2775 2729 0 16:21 pts/1 00:00:00 grep bind

# dig @192.168.0.254

and

#dig @127.0.0.1         shows the same result.


If DNS has been installed in the server and how to configure it properly so 
that the local WinXP can ping either its IP address or name

Thanks

I, for one, think it ought to be up to the admin, not the 
package-management system, as to when applications are forced into 
using the upgraded packages.

Take, for instance, the openssl package update. On our main Linux
login server at work (Red Hat 7.3), 136 separate packages require the
openssl dynamic libraries:

  [heinlein]$ rpm -q --whatrequires libssl.so.2 | wc -l
      136

Among them are

* mail clients: balsa, evolution, mutt, pine
* web browers: galeon, lynx
* service daemons: apache, openldap, postgresql, sendmail, squid

I like to be able to upgrade libraries as soon as the update is posted 
so that, on the one hand, clients like pine or galeon pick up the 
upgrade the next time someone launches them.

But...

But I certainly don't want mail or database access disrupted 
willy-nilly at the same time. That's silly: "I'm sorry, everyone, but 
we have to schedule a service downtime because our package manager 
wants to install some bugfixes and who knows what applications it 
will automatically choose to restart."

True, Red Hat's notice could have said something to the effect of

  You can easily discover which packages are affected by the upgrade
  to this package by querying the RPM database:

     rpm -q --whatrequires libssl.so.2
     rpm -q --whatrequires libcrypto.so.2

  As soon as possible, you'll want to restart long-running processes 
  associated with the list of packages returned by your queries.

That completely different, however, than putting such restarts into 
the hands of the package-management system. I shudder to think about 
the service disruptions...

At some point, you face two choices:

* dumb things down like Microsoft has so that every update tells the 
  admin s/he should reboot the system

* rely on the admin to know what's running on the system and what will 
  be affected by a library upgrade.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0210020632410.6640-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Progress is being made, but I'm still not where I want to be.

  The logs were rotated again this morning, according to
/etc/cron.daily/logrotate's report mailed to root (and forwarded to me).
However, /var/log/maillog was _not_ rotated.

  I took /var/log/maillog out of /etc/logrotate.d/syslog, but it remains as
a separate script in that directory.

  Let me see if I have this correct:
	cron calls /etc/cron.daily
	/etc/cron.daily includes both 1postfix (the mail log analyzer) and
		logrotate. So the mail log is analyzed before it's
		rotated. That's fine; should be only the previous 24 hrs.
	/etc/cron.daily/logrotate is a shell script that invokes
		/usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf
	/etc/logrotate.conf includes /etc/logrotate.d
	/etc/logrotate.d/ is a directory that contains scripts for:
		junkbuster  maillog  mgetty  psacct  rpm  samba  snmpd  syslog  uucp

  And we've come full circle: the /etc/logrotate.d/maillog script is not being
called, apparently. That script calls for daily rotation of
/var/log/maillog.

  If I have this correct, then I'm at a complete loss to understand why the
last step is not taken. Can someone nudge me in the right direction, please?

Thanks,

Rich

Hold the presses.  I too am fighting a logrotate issue and noticed while
looking at your problem (and mine) that somewhere along the line the mail
logs have been moved from /var/log to /var/log/mail.
   Looking in /etc/syslog.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/syslog and a mail
stats script there are some differences.  Some are looking at
/var/log/maillog and some at /var/log/mail/maillog.
   Are we rotating one file (or at least trying to) and analyzing 
another?

Paul, is there anyway to determine which of these or other applications
are, or might be, statically linked?  Or is that even an issue?  My guess
is the rpm database wouldn't know.

  Not me! /etc/syslog.conf includes:

  I do believe, Rod, that static libraries end in .a and all .so are
shared/dynamic libs.

  You could run `rpm -q --whatrequires libssl.a`; on my system there are no
such packages.

It is an issue, but, no, rpm doesn't keep track of static linking.  
You'd have to run nm or objdump against all your binaries to check for
the presence of the old library routines.

Stephen,

It sounds like a DNS issue definitely, but I'm a bit a novice at
"setting up" named on a server, I recently began to try and get my
webserver to handle DNS.  It's a bit of a brain cell killer...so I pay a
local hosting company to do DNS for this web-server, until I can get
some reading material on DNS--

On my system, Running Mandrake...

In 

/var/named

theres a file <domainame>.<suffix>

it's what I know as the "zone" file.  It's where the IP and reverse IP
info. resides.  For this machine, although I'm just now getting into
doing DNS with this machine.

Here's what it looks like, I know it's a little messy...but notice the
how the names are correlated to the IP of the machine.


@               IN      SOA     superhero.kidmillennium.net.
root at kidmillennium.net. (
                        2002090202 ; serial
                        1H ; refresh
                        15 ; retry
                        14D ; expire
                        12H ; default_ttl
                        )
webmail         IN      A       198.88.146.58
@               IN      MX      5       superhero.kidmillennium.net.
@               IN      NS      superhero.kidmillennium.net.
@               IN      A       198.88.146.58
mail            IN      A       198.88.146.58
superhero       IN      A       198.88.146.58


I don't know that this is actually functional...I pay a local hosting
company (www.kattare.com) to do DNS for this web-server, and I can just
edit it on-line...I think his server even updates the "serial number"
automagically if I forget.  You must update the serial number for your
changes to the zone file to take affect, and replicate/propagate
properly.   

Hope this points you in the right direction.

Who said anything about rebooting?  I meant stopping and restarting 
running processes, like the original thread complained about when 
Apache/SSL was upgrade - but not restarted - and the system was 
subsequently hacked.

Also, the downtime during a Debian upgrade is nil to none - the packages 
are updated, reconfigured, stopped and then immediately restarted.  Only 
if a user just *happened* to connect to said application during the 
second or two that the process is restarting would they see any 
problems.  They would probably attribute it to a timeout somewhere, and 
try again.

For those of us who covet our precious uptime, but want to keep things 
updated - and that doesn't necessarily mean the kernel - this is STILL 
the way to do things.  Even my aforementioned pcmcia upgrade worked fine 
after I realized what it did and restarted it manually after everything 
else was completed.

I recall being asked if I wanted to restart pcmcia.  Presumably, a
"no" there would have prevented the brief loss of connectivity.

Now that you removed the duplicate entry that was causing that error, 
did you rerun "logrotate" in debug mode and to see if it reported 
anything interesting?

Also I went back and looked at your original posting with your logrotate 
configuration for your maillog:

Does it make sense to have a "size" directive when you're rotating the 
log on a daily basis? I have a daily rotation for my "MySQL" log that 
does not specify a "size". In your case you don't care about the file 
size just that the file is rotated on a daily basis.

The other thing you might try is removing the "copytruncate" and add a 
"create 640 root root" directive instead. This will cause the existing 
log file to be compressed and a new, empty file is created in its 
place. On my system my logfiles have root both as owner and group so 
that's why I supplied the "create" sample I did. You can omit any of 
the attributes for "create" and logrotate will use the attributes from 
the original file.

Hi Stephen,

The best source of troubleshooting DNS problems is the syslog.  Each
time the DNS server starts, it logs what zones were loaded and what
zones were not loaded (as well as what line in the zone file it didn't
like).  It also tells you what ip address it is listening on.

The best advice I've heard is to never create your zone files from
scratch, always copy a zone file that you know works and make changes to
that.

Subject: [PLUG] Open Office - Hooray!
Message-ID: <20021002171744.58BA535AC7@ados.com>

Hi all!

A success story! (so far...)

I am about 1 year into using Linux (Mandrake 8.1)
I live in rural them-thar hills (dial-up connection, discussions about public 
trans. are a joke to me) and after a SEVEN HOUR download, I installed Open 
Office all by myself!

This is a 'thank-you' and tribute all the folk on this list who have helped 
me with newbie questions so far, and also a great deal of credit goes to the 
Open Office folks for creating a program and an instructional web page so 
that just about anyone can install it.

I was pleased to find that it opened some 'test' Microsoft documents I had. 
Not perfectly though - fonts look 'clunky' (no improvement over Star Office 
5.2) but it doesn't FLOOD your desktop, at least.

Next tests for me are:

1) Let's see how it handles check-boxes in Word, and
2) Let's see if the people I work with over the Internet (who are all 
IE/Outlook sheep) see in THEIR copy of a .doc file I created, everything that 
I see. (Is it WYSIWYG in -both- directions.)
3) Oh yeah - printing...


I'll let you know how it goes...

			   Overview of LVM
		       (Logical Volume Manager)

				  by
			   Cooper Stevenson
		    <cooper at linux-enterprise.net>


      Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a system for handling disks
      and disk partitions.  It enables one to "glue" two or more
      disks or partitions together to form a larger virtual
      disk which can then be logically partitioned and used like
      a normal disk, only with extra features.  For example, one
      can resize LVM based file systems.

      **********************************************************

          Agenda:

              7:00 - 7:30  Business

  "/var/log/maillog" 2002-9-30

  This is not the problem, either.

  But, don't get discouraged! There _has_ to be a reason, right?

Well, if it did not solve his problem, it may have solved mine.

Logrotate was going out and trying to read about 10,000 bogus error 
messages in a directory that no longer existed.  Hopefully nuking the 
status file will end that behaviour.  (The process would wedge with 99% 
cpu usage.)

This file is only used to keep track of the last (successful?) rotation to
the best of my knowledge.  You should also look at all the files
associated with logrotate to make sure those bogus entries (non-existent
directories ) aren't in one of them.
   I do vaguely remember problems with entries in 
/var/lib/logrotate.status but that has been years ago.  Let me know if you 
_don't_ find the bogus directories in the other logrotate files.

  Wow! All of a sudden there are a lot of us with log rotation problems (or
"quirks"). I don't feel bad that I'm the only one suffering from

Hi, folks.

Well, I *kinda* go the RAID array working.
I did it as software raid, and it all seems to be working smoothly.

/proc/mdstat shows:

	Personalities : [raid0] [raid1]
	read_ahead 1024 sectors
	md2 : active raid1 md/1[1] md/0[0]
	      156301248 blocks [2/2] [UU]
	      [>....................]  resync =  0.1% (171864/156301248)

	md1 : active raid0 ide/host3/bus0/target1/lun0/disc[1]
ide/host3/bus0/target0/lun0/disc[0]
	      156301312 blocks 8k chunks

	md0 : active raid0 ide/host2/bus0/target1/lun0/disc[1]
ide/host2/bus0/target0/lun0/disc[0]
	      156301312 blocks 8k chunks

	unused devices: <none>

My only question is this:  how the heck do I mount the RAID?

I've tried
	mount -text3 /dev/md2 /mnt/raid
	mount -text2 /dev/md2 /mnt/raid

and I get the same error each time:

Again, many thanks in advance :)

What was the error?

My first guess is that the raid array isn't started.

windoze.  I know that most of us don't like windoze, but in the healthcare

Install windows first, then install linux. Use Lilo (or grub - if you
must). Fancy crap like "system commander" is a waste of space.
Also, google is a good place to look.
Also, this question is asked in here about once a month, so the
archives would be a good place to look.

Both Linux and BSD include bootstraps that will support this, just
install windows first.

What was the error?

My first guess is that the raid array isn't started.

Speaking as a Linux newbie, I'd have to agree with that. I've
installed Linux on three machines already and after each effort I
felt like I'd been rode hard and put away wet. But with a little
help from friends and allies, all my machines are working. And I
think it's good that learning Linux is hard. There's value in a bit
of struggle.

Me, I'll use both systems as long as they butter my bread and don't
eat my lunch.

	I had a real bad experience with an ASUS (CL2) motherboard. 
Seems that ASUS tweaks their boards, some. They HATE Micron RAM!

	Let me repeat that:  NEVER use an ASUS motherboard with Micron RAM!

	... Weird, almost impossible-to-diagnose problems appear and 
cause numerous kernel panics while the motherboard EATS the RAMM.

	Had an older (abt 3 years) Intel 810 board go bad, AND the 
Intel 815 that replaced it. Turned out to be a bad CD-ROM drive 
(according to Pacific Solutions) that killed the secondary IDE 
controller on the brand new (815) board. Probably a combination of 
heat and the bad CD-ROM drive that caused the original 810 board to 
go, as well.
	Overall, I stick with Intel boards, myself. The built-in NICs 
are better than on some boards.

	I see Soyo all over at Fry's. Very few Intel boards. Maybe it 
was just their inventory that day, or something.  Dunno.

I used to hear Amptron boards referred to as "the finest motherboards made
in someone's garage." I hope their products have improved since I first
encountered them. About half of my ten PM-9100s BSOD when the video
drivers are installed in Win95 <spit>. Sorry, just my experience...

POOR = ECS K7S5A + Duron  lan/audio in MB

Watch the ads and you can pick up the MB and 1.2 Duron for $79, Fry's had some
$30 32M TNT video cards with $20 mail in. With 256 Mb DDR ( no name Fry's  ) at
$42, $79 Samsung 48x12x48 ( CompUSA ) with $50 mail in and $35 case from ENU, I
put together a couple of boxes for ~$281. I had some 265 DRAM I wanted to use
in the MB but couldn't get to work. I don't know if it was me, the MB or the
RAM. 

Watch the ads and you can pick up the MB for $49 and put whatever AMD you want
with it. I think this is the cheapest board in town but a friend is using the
MSI KLE133 Audio Video LAN ATA100 from ENU $62 for Windows systems. With the
savings of video card this might be a better deal.

He was able to put together a Athlon 1700+ XP with 256 Mb Ram, 40G drive, cheap
cdrom ( can't remember the spec ) for, I think he said ~$245. The video is
NVidia so it should work with Linux but I can't say for sure this MB works with
Linux.

Those are the cheapest systems I know of.

If you have the cash the 7200 RPM 80G Western digital with 8M buffer is really
fast. $120 ( ENU ) and 1.5 times faster than the 7200 40G Western Digital it
replaced. ( I used the 40G in the new box ) Fry's was selling the 80G for $139
with $40 mail in. $99 pug $.34 is pretty nice ( I remember paying more than I
could spare at the time, for a 230M disk, so if this doesn't seem all that
great please take into account my being around when 8M ram was something I
thought I would buy after I won the lottery. )

Thank you
Russell

That file was the cause of the problem.  The bogus entries were from
someone trying to hack mailman on my server.  (The script just dumped a
bunch of crap in the log.)  I need to investigate this farther. There
may be a race condition in logrotate that is causing the problem.  (If
you have more than 10,000 files in a directory, ext2 slows down a GREAT
deal.  If logrotate has a file in logstatus that suddenly disappears, it
seems to go out to lunch for a very long time.  (Like until killed.)

Did you issue a lilo after building your system?

There is discription on the web somewhere what each letter in LILO means when 
booting.  Any case says that lilo cannot read the boot sector completely.  
There is a second and third part of lilo that is read from the disk 
partition.  This is what gets updated when you run lilo after configuring 
lilo.conf.  There is sometimes mention of adding a linear parameter, but 
first try coordinating your boot sector with your current configuration.  
Boot into that configuration using your boot floppy.  Then run lilo.  The 
copy you boot sector as before and complete the process.  Then try again to 
boot from the ntldr and choose Linux.

Good Luck.

I'll second the K7S5A recommendation.  We are using it in our fileserver
at the office with no problems.  Since it is a server, the onboard sound
doesn't get used.  As you are doing sound work, you might want to confirm
that the onboard sound will work for you.

Well,
It took two months to convince my colleagues in our eng. dept.
to switch our operations and process data analysis into Linux environment. 
It happened almost two years ago. Up to the present moment our dept. is 
running only on SuSE Linux. Totally M$ free environment! 
All my colleagues are running Linux on their home computers and don't
wan't even hear about Winbloze. 
In the last year we had company wide M$ OS/software license audit. 
You should have seen those M$ auditors who tried to check M$ registration 
numbers on our Linux boxes!  We didn't say to them that we 're running on 
Linux. That was an unforgettable entertaining show!
These dorks tried to contact M$ tech support in order to determine what 
version of winbloze we're running, why it doesn't look like it and where to 
find reg. number. We were laughing like crazy.
Our manager screwed our entertainment by telling them that it's not a Winblows 
but Linux - Miky$oft killer. 
Auditors went away all red faced.  
Other departments started to express their interest in Linux as well.

Actually I was doing this today.

Now try to make a filesystem on the raid partition (if that's the right
word)

Something like 

mkfs.ext3 /dev/md0

then try to mount it with

mount /dev/md0 /mnt

This should work.

  Looks to me like several mail log rotation problems have been solved.
Except for mine. :-(

  As yesterday, logrotate.d sends me a message reading that it ran at 4:13
this morning, but the maillog hasn't been rotated since I did so manually
four days ago.

  Do I need to creat a cron job to have /var/log/maillog rotated daily?
While I suppose this kludge would work, it misses the point that something
is not right despite the files _appearing_ to all be proper.

  What do I do to diagnose/test this further? The suggestins made so far
have been found to not apply here, but they've helped Alan with his problem.
Now I'd like to fix the one here.

Thanks,

Rich

Well, lessening the filtering shouldn't affect mail retrieval, since
the filters are applied when mail is received.

Are these users using outlook? I've noticed that with outlook mail
retrieval is very slow, but with say, the mozilla mail client, it
works as excepted.

BTW: Postfix is an MTA. There is something else allowing you to
retrieve your mail - a separate pop or imap server. The problem may
be there.

Plug seemed a bit slow this morning, so here's a story to read.

 -----------------------------------------

 The Parable of Free Air
 http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=33949&cid=3674122

 Once upon a time, some people lived in a cave, and no one knew that
 there was a world outside of the cave. The cave provided everything
 they needed, with plenty of fish and water. Luminous mushrooms
 provided both food and light. The only thing in short supply was
 air. All air came through a small shaft connected to the outside
 world. The shaft was controlled by a single company, Microshaft,
 which carefully rationed its flow to maximize demand and collected
 breathing license fees from everyone who had to breath. To save money
 the company hired cheap labor to operate the valves, but these
 laborers were often barely competent, and the air supply was
 unreliable. The shaft was poorly maintained, the air was often stale
 and laden with viruses. By selling a product that cost them
 essentially nothing to produce, Microshaft's profits were enormous
 and they became rich and powerful.

 One day, a group of daring young renegades discovered that there were
 other ways to get air, just by moving some rocks that blocked
 openings to the outside. And they offered their air free. At first
 people were hesitant to use Free Air, thinking something must be
 wrong with it since it was free. Initially Microshaft ignored the
 renegades, dismissing them as a fringe movement and minor
 nuisance. But eventually Microshaft saw them as a threat. They
 started a major marketing campaign to convince people that the Free
 Air was bad for their health. But people found that they actually
 felt better and healthier breathing the free, fresh air. Microshaft
 added more and more features to their air, perfuming it and coloring
 it with smoke to give it "added value". Many people started to
 dislike Microshaft's heavy, bloated air that was hard to breath and
 began flocking in droves to the sources of Free Air.

 About this time, after some years of hard volunteer work, Open Air
 developers finally increased the size of a Free Air portal so that a
 person could actually squeeze through to the outside. The first brave
 individuals who ventured through it discovered that not only was
 there an unlimited supply of air in the outside world, there was no
 way you could harness and control its supply.

 Alarmed, Microshaft sought to have the government declare Free Air
 illegal since it threatened their business model, which they had
 developed and rightfully earned through many years of hard work. They
 called the use of Free Air "theft" and claimed that the "viral"
 nature of the Public Breathing License advocated by many Open Air
 rebels would threaten the livelihood of Microshaft's suppliers and
 distributors. Indeed, the whole economy of the cave would collapse,
 they said. Laws were quickly passed and the portals of Free Air were
 sealed off.

 A charitable organization called the Business Air Alliance was formed
 to help protect businesses against the threat of Free Air portals. By
 proving that it was theoretically possible to fund terrorist
 organizations with the money saved by breathing Free Air, the BAA
 successfully lobbied to strengthen the laws so that any attempt to
 make an opening to the outside became punishable by death. Possession
 of shovels and picks became a criminal offense, and the BAA performed
 random audits to help citizens comply with the law. For their
 protection, everyone was required to wear an Air Rights Management
 security device, which would send an alarm to the authorities if it
 didn't detect a secret mix of fumes found only in Microshaft air.

 As time passed, Microshaft and the government became
 indistinguishable. To prevent future uprisings, a new feature was
 added to the air to keep the people sedated happily ever after.

Short answer: Yes.

Longer answer: I would create more than 3 partitions.  First, I've never done anything with the BSDs so I'm not sure what an optimal partitioning scheme would look like to them.  But here is what I would do for the windows/linux partitions: First, I would make small /boot partitions (one for linux and one for the BSD) close to the beginning of the drive (under the 1024 cylinder limit).  While this isn't absolutely necessary with newer BIOSes, it eliminates the possibility of a problem.  Next I would make sure that my Windows partition starts under the 1024 cylinder limit. Then I would create a swap partition for linux and perhaps for the BSD (I don't know whether BSD does swap files, or whatever.  Like I said, I'm not familiar with it). Finally I would make my / partitions for linux and BSD.  Depending on what you are planning on using linux for and how many different distros you'll want to try, you might think about making a separate partition for /home.  Up to you though.  I hope that this helped.

Hey Rich,

Let's back up a little. I've lost track of exactly what your config file 
looks like, what the current output of logrotate is in debug mode, and 
what the log directory looks like. (ls -la output on /var/log or 
wherever maillog exists.

Could you post those three things?

  Two things here: first, in /etc/logrotate.conf I had inadvertently included
logrotate.d twice. When I removed one of those statements the output changed
to include the above. For some reason, this didn't show up yesterday (or
Tuesday, whenever it was that I ran logrotate with the debug option).

  Second, while /var/log/maillog was just rotated, it still is 970K in size
and includes records back to 9/30.

  I also just removed (before running logrotate -d) the line in
/etc/logrotate.d/maillog that specified rotation when the log file was > 1M.
If it's rotated daily it should not be greater than 1M anyway. Here's
/etc/logrotate.d/maillog:

/var/log/maillog {
    daily
    rotate 4
    copytruncate
    notifempty
    missingok
    postrotate
        /usr/bin/killall -HUP syslogd
    endscript
}

  Is there something here that needs correcting?

Thanks, Russ,

Rich

Linux likes a separate partition for swap, so I would use 4 partitions.
A windows partition, a Linux swap, a Linux root, a BSD.  ( think the
winblows partition has to be the first one on the disk)

I'd keep it to four primary partitions, unless you have an older bios
that has restrictions.  BSD "partitions" its partition so it doe snot
require a separate partition for swap.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0210031103140.11606-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  For the past couple of hours, whenever I close and re-invoke pine the
process halts while I see a message, "Formatting scroll text ---- 95% ".
Eventually this goes away and is replaced by a message, "Unable to connect
to cnews.newsguy.com:119".

  That domain is not found (by grepping) in ~/mail/* or
/var/spool/mail/rshepard.

  What can be causing this and what can I do about it?

  Part 2. When I tried sending this message just now, postfix at my site
rejected it because of the subject. That line read, "A strange MUA
behavior". Nowhere in /etc/postfix/header_checks do any of these words
appear. Just what I need, more nonsense with mail.

Thanks,

Some questions to help narrow down the cause.  Do you have iptables or
ipchains filtering your network traffic, as well as the mail filters? 
Do you have control over your reverse lookup (DNS)?

Does anyone have any idea why apache is no longer logging access
requests or errors for me.  I upgraded to 1.3.26.  The new version's
http.conf file does do a few different things, but appears to log in the
same way to the same place.  Any idea on why this changed with the new
version?

See what happens when you simplify this. The syslog logrotate 
configuration file only has

/var/log/messages /var/log/secure /var/log/maillog /var/log/spooler 
/var/log/boot.log /var/log/cron {
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
    /bin/kill -HUP `cat /var/run/syslogd.pid 2> /dev/null` 2> /dev/null 
|| true
    endscript
}

in it. Put this in your maillog stanza:

/var/log/maillog {
    daily
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
    /bin/kill -HUP `cat /var/run/syslogd.pid 2> /dev/null` 2> /dev/null 
|| true
    endscript
}

I believe it should inherit the rotate 4 from /etc/logrotate.conf, and 
I'm not sure the rest is needed.

Is there any nntp-server entry in your ~/.pinerc file?

Does the Apache user have write access to the log files?

  I was getting error messages about two attempts to rotate /var/log/maillog
so I took out the reference in /etc/logrotate.d/syslog.

  I'm not sure either. I _think_ I got this from the postfix installation,
but I'm not sure who put it there.

  Well, I just made your recommended changes and re-ran logrotate with debug
on. According to the output:

rotating pattern: /var/log/maillog  after 1 days (4 rotations)
empty log files are rotated, old logs are removed
considering log /var/log/maillog
  log needs rotating
rotating log /var/log/maillog
renaming /var/log/maillog.5 to /var/log/maillog.5 (rotatecount 4, logstart
1, i 5), 
renaming /var/log/maillog.4 to /var/log/maillog.5 (rotatecount 4, logstart
1, i 4), 
renaming /var/log/maillog.3 to /var/log/maillog.4 (rotatecount 4, logstart
1, i 3), 
renaming /var/log/maillog.2 to /var/log/maillog.3 (rotatecount 4, logstart
1, i 2), 
renaming /var/log/maillog.1 to /var/log/maillog.2 (rotatecount 4, logstart
1, i 1), 
renaming /var/log/maillog.0 to /var/log/maillog.1 (rotatecount 4, logstart
1, i 0), 
renaming /var/log/maillog to /var/log/maillog.1
creating new log mode = 0600 uid = 0 gid = 0
removing old log /var/log/maillog.5
running shared postrotate script
running script with arg /var/log/maillog : "   
    /bin/kill -HUP at /var/run/syslogd.pid 2> /dev/null 2> /dev/null
  || true
"
  Looks great, eh? But, ls -la /var/log shows:

-rw-------    1 root     root      1046804 Oct  3 13:38 maillog
-rw-------    1 root     root       938543 Sep  8 01:02 maillog.2

  No maillog.1, no new maillog, existing maillog still has records from 30
September.

  The logrotate debug output reports all these changes, but they are not
seen in /var/log. Is this user error some place? I'm really puzzled now.

Thanks,

Rich

Paul,

  Yes: news.aracnet.com. And that's been there for a while now.

  I keep looking for a pattern when I get this message about loading, and
the pause at 95%. Seemed to me that it is related to either html mail or
something else from Microsoft's MUA that pine has to handle before
displaying the messages.

  I removed the last couple of messages from my inbox (wrote them to disk),
but that made no difference. Then, as suddenly as it appeared, the message
went away.

Too strange by far!

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

When running "logrotate" in debug mode it only "tells" you what it's 
going to do but it doesn't actually do anything. Run it without the 
debug argument and it should actually to what it says its gonna do.

  Sonofagun! So it's trying to attach to the nntp port (I didn't pick up on
the port number) and that's where 'scroll text' comes from? Huh!

  And I use slrn for Usenet, not pine. Guess I'll take that out again.

Thanks, Paul,

Its a good point, but not the answer.

I change the logs to 666 which where owned by root (apache runs as
nobody) and set to 600.  Still, no difference however.

Sean (and listers)

I've got raid working. It's a good feeling to know, knowing that I did it,
considering my amazing lack of experience with Linux.

Also, I've gotten the box to act as a PDC for our Windows machines.

Now, to get the NT box up and running as BDC and tape backup server.

Ah, the work of an IT department (that would be ME) is never done...

AND... the IBM document referenced below was a help. As was a slew of other
documentation, primarily the HOW-TOs and one mailing list (ataraid list at
redhat) that said it WAS possible to use software raid with the Promise
controllers.

TTFN!

Actually I was doing this today.

Now try to make a filesystem on the raid partition (if that's the right
word)

Something like

mkfs.ext3 /dev/md0

then try to mount it with

mount /dev/md0 /mnt

This should work.

Actually this document

Seems to be the most complete and up to date that we (my workmates and

That was never in question, and I'm sorry if my answers gave the 
impression that I said that.

My point was that if you are using the hardware raid features of the 
Promise card, then you don't need the software raid features of the kernel.

If you are using the software raid features of the kernel, then you are 
using the Promise card as a standard EIDE controller, and not a raid 
controller. You may or may not see a performance hit by doing it this way.

Subject: [PLUG] squid and non-browser access
Message-ID: <20021003174431.A4834@defiant.ncplus.net>

Howdy!

I finally figgered out how to get pppd to dial out, persistently, and
on demand. And I got squid to let the demand come from a different
server. However, I haven't figgered out what to set to let the demand
on the different server be from a non-browser app.

Konqueror and Netscape have a proxy setup page. I haven't found that
setup in lynx or mutt or fetchmail or sendmail.

The network:

dax:
 modem
 pppd
 squid
 nic

auger:
 browser
 nic

defiant:
 lynx
 nic
 mutt

I can get the browser on auger to start a ppp session on dax, and see
the network. Doesn't work for the news reader tho, or mutt, or the
instant messenger.

defiant also has a modem, mostly because it's a laptop; so I do email
by dialing direct. But I'd like to get my email thru the network - the
multitech regularly connects at 26.4 while the xircom usually connects
at 14.4 (features of being in Port Hadlock).

TIA!

Try this

I think it's for a 675, but is probably the same.

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=cisco+678+password+re
covery
produces
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/474/pswdrec_6xx.html
the official cisco process for password recovery, which also works for the
675 etc

The first option gets the current password out of NVRAM, the second blasts
the entire configuration, resetting the password.
I have had to do this more than once, and its a bit of a pain, but much
better than having a $100+ paperweight.

Most QWEST DSL users have a 675 or 678 dsl router, incase anyone was
wondering.

Lopster was a fine, fine piece of work, for my needs.  Slick and very

Did we ever discover what happened to the servers/server lists?

Subject: [PLUG] New motherboard: Do I need to re-install?
Message-ID: <3D9DA9AA.9C59373E@computer-arts.net>

Running RH 7.2. I just replaced my old Gigabyte GA-6BX7+ motherboard
which used an Intel PII with an ECS K7S5A (recommended in the previous

"Motherboard advice" thread.) The new board has and AMD Duron processor
on it.

All I did was swap the motherboards and then boot it up. In other
words, I didn't do anything Linux-wise to configure for the new
type of processor. Everything basically came up okay. But, as you 
would expect, there are a few "oddities."

Before I start to debug what's left, it occurred to me to ask if
I should really have re-installed Linux. For example could some
libraries or other code have been loaded or built that depend on
the processor type?

Along the same lines (and I realize that this is probably a pretty
open ended question without a "real" answer) how common it is for
mainstream Linux applications to build code that is dependent on
processor type?

Thanks. I had looked here a couple of days ago and they weren't there
yet.  Now they are.  Is there a way to upgrade my machine with the new
version without overwriting my existing data files?  Or is backing up
the only way?  Most importantly I'm want to preserve my Evolution inbox
and contacts.

I've never known a Red Hat package to muck around in a user's home 
directory. Anything in /home should be off-limits...

but a backup is always a good thing :-)

Ah, then we'll just call it a misunderstanding on my part :)

I wasn't interested in hardware raid because everything I'd read said that
you'd be stuck with the 2.4.18 until Promise came out with a new driver and
things that I had read made it look like it might be a while for a new
driver.

Anyway, it's working, I'm logging in. Next step... LDAP!

That was never in question, and I'm sorry if my answers gave the
impression that I said that.

My point was that if you are using the hardware raid features of the
Promise card, then you don't need the software raid features of the kernel.

If you are using the software raid features of the kernel, then you are
using the Promise card as a standard EIDE controller, and not a raid
controller. You may or may not see a performance hit by doing it this way.

  In what directory(ies) are your data files? /home is safe from trashing,
so is /usr/local IIF it's on a separate filesystem.

Could somebody please advise where should

Or should I convert my Perl script into C/C++

What is the better approach to achieve this goal?

This is a Perl FAQ.  Check out:

http://perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perlfaq3.html#How-can-I-compile-my-Perl-program-into-byte-code-or-C-

The short answer is that it won't help very much.  You can learn a lot
about the subject by using Google to search through the archives of
comp.lang.perl.misc, or try searching Perlmonks.com

Just backup the subfolders inside

up and running, just copy the contents into the new
/home/YOUR_NEW_SYSTEM'S_USER_NAME/evolution/local.  I've done this many
times with evolution, and it's always worked, even going from later
versions of evolution back to earlier (don't ask me why, it's

  You realize, of course, that devolving is not the way to get ahead in the
biological world. Evolution is supposed to be unidirectional although the
rates of change can be gradual or very quick.

  I read this from a newsletter sent to me earlier this week. Microsoft's

There was some kind of perl2exe tool that used to be advertised in he Perl
Journal as I recall...

But first consider:
If your Perl script is mostly doing text processing (which is common
for Perl scripts) then it's not likely that you'll speed it up much at all
by converting to C++ and compiling.  Perl's regex engine is highly
optimized already.

Perhaps you should figure out which parts of the script might be sped up
by moving to C and rewrite only those parts and create an extension that
is callable from C (Use the Inline::C module for this).  For example, if
you're doing some kind of matrix
multiplication (something that you _could_ speed up in C) Inline::C let's
you insert the C code for doing this into your Perl code.  It takes care
of compiling and creating an extenstion from the C code.

So it's likely that you won't be able to speed up things too much by
moving to C/C++ (in the case of text processing), but for other cases
where things can be sped up in C try using the Inline::C module to rewrite
those parts instead of rewriting everything in C/C++.

How would a script get access to the clipboard (or, more to the useful
point, the mouse paste buffer)?

I use wget the way some organic life uses, say, oxygen.  I think it'd be
damned handy to do what you've defined above, but I wouldn't know how to
grab the data short of actually pressing the middle button on my mouse to
add an argument to my get command.  A script would be neato because it
could also properly parse out shell metas and so on.

True Story:

A friend, Wayne, built his own Airplane.  It *mostly* works.  The latest
adventure was a cooling problem.  He was messing with oil coolers to fix
it, and therefore leaking a lot of oil.  He put an old ripped up carpet
on the ground under the engine to catch the leaking oil.

When he went to test the new cooling engine, it works, but the prop
snagged a loose end of the carpet and wound it around itself until the
prop snapped.

My Comment:

Wayne failed to build a thread-safe engine........

One more followup to my "new motherboard" questions. The K7S5A
has on-board sound. Linux finds it as "i810_audio." If anyone
has used this sound chip (especially on this motherboard) I'd
like to hear how it worked for you. I haven't been able to get
it to work very well so far.

Just curious, but why did you go with a raid1 of two raid0s instead of a
great big raid5?

Seems to me that you'd get just as much redundancy and 50% more drive
capacity out of a raid5 array of the four disks you've got.

Did you put a filesystem on the device?

Even with lots of (mostly superficial) improvements, Windows is still no
cakewalk.  So what's the point?

Computers are complex devices and expecting them to operate smoothly with
absolutely no specialized knowledge on the part of the user is absurd.  
Reviewers and most users are familiar with the methods and terminology
that Microsoft uses and therefore are confused by anything that is
different.  I would say that in the modern age, a wholly new computer user
would have more difficulty and frustration taking a Windows CD and bare
hardware to a working internet-connected workstation than a Debian
GNU/Linux CD and bare hardware to the same end point.  And in the end, the
Debian GNU/Linux system would be more stable, more secure, and have more
available software.  Hence, the longer the system is used, the lower the
pain and frustration regardless of learning.  You can know everything
there is to know about Windows and still have to reboot regularly and
experience occasional lock-ups.  Knowledge doesn't decrease your pain
(though knowing WHY you locked up might alleviate some of the
frustration... or it could make it worse.  Depends on your personality
type, I guess).

Anyway, I just woke up.

One thing I DO like about current iterations of Linux over M$ is that 
there is a LOT of hardware that Linux just works with, and M$ requires 
driver cds, disks, or trips to the 3rd party vendor webpages to find 
drivers for.

IE Win98 NEVER saw my nVidia graphics cards (not even TNT1!) nor my 
Diamond audio card.  I don't think w2k was much better.  Starting up 
windows in 640x480x16 is a painful experience on a 19" monitor.

I have a development board that drivers do _not_ exist for M$ on the 
web, yet I'm positive that Knoppix would see everything just *fine* and 
it'd work flawlessly.  Well, just as soon as I get it to POST again.

Mike;

I have the K7SEM. It uses the SIS 7018 Codec Sound chipset.

This is listed as the ``Trident 4DWave DX/NS, SIS 7018 or ALi 5451 PCI
Audio Core'' option in the 2.4.18 kernel.

If your sound chipset is the same then this is the way to go. It works
great for me.

Hmmm... Mine doesn't appear to be using the same chipset:

  kernel: Intel 810 + AC97 Audio, version 0.21, 06:29:46 Jun  1 2002
  kernel: PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:02.7
  kernel: i810: SiS 7012 found at IO 0xd400 and 0xdc00, IRQ 11
  kernel: i810_audio: Audio Controller supports 2 channels.
  kernel: ac97_codec: AC97  codec, id: 0x434d:0x4941 (Unknown)
  kernel: i810_audio: only 48Khz playback available.
  kernel: i810_audio: AC'97 codec 0 Unable to map surround DAC's (or DAC's not present), total
channels = 2
  modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module sound-service-0-0

Google reveals that there are various drivers available, but I haven't
figured out whether any of them solves the "only 48Khz" problem. This
does appear to be an issue for the sound software I'm using, which
wants to do 44.1

Anyway, the search continues...

Mike;

The best answer I can give you from here is to compile ``Intel ICH (i8xx)
support in a new kernel. The help section for this option states that it
includes support for your sound chipset.

Modules have gotten a lot better with recent kernels in my opinion. If you
would rather eliminate *any* chance for hassle then simply compile it in.

Are the oddities related to peripheral devices (like sound card), or
core devices (like harddrive)? The only distribution that I know of that
would require a complete reinstall because of this change is Gentoo.
(Does Linux-From-Scratch count as a distribution?)  The other
distributions compile their packages to run on as little hardware as
possible.  About the only exception is the kernel, where you can choose
a precompiled version for your architecture.  The most common problem
I've seen with trying to change architecture out from under an OS is
failure to mount the root partition (even though the drive could be read
well enough to load the kernel), but it sounds like you have gotten past
that hurdle.  This doesn't mean that your kernel is optimized for the
Duron, or the chipset on your new motherboard, just that it is generic
enough not to choke on your hardware.  For optimization, I recommend
configuring and compiling your own kernel.

I can't think of a way to do that in bash, but I bet it could be done

Based on what you say below, it sounds like the issues I
have left are probably NOT related to the processor change. 
That is what I had guessed, but I thought I'd ask, since
this is the first time I've tried to do a swap like this.

How did you do it?  Are you just using pppd settings?  While it has been a
while since I have messed with pppd, it can be set to bring the link to the
internet up on demand, and for any kind of traffic, not just HTTP.

On auger, you can just set up a default route to dax, and on dax have pppd
configured to be its default route.  Any traffic on auger for the 'net, be
it HTTP, ssh, telnet, anything, should cause dax to bring the link up, and
dax should forward packets for auger and the laptop.

Check The Fine Manual as to whether you need to set up dax as a router.  If
you do, then adding the following to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local should fix
that:
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

One thing to watch out for: you would likely want to set up sendmail (or
whatever MTA you are using) to queue up mail rather than trying to deliver
straightaway, otherwise every e-mail you send will cause the link to come
up.

You do not need to set up pppd for each application.

Why a raid 0+1?  I'm not really sure. I *know* I had a good reason when I
decided to do it... *shrugs*
And the filesystem thing - I thought that that was the problem (it was) and
I figured out how to do it.

It took some research to figure out how to put an ext3 fs on the drives :)

Just curious, but why did you go with a raid1 of two raid0s instead of a
great big raid5?

Seems to me that you'd get just as much redundancy and 50% more drive
capacity out of a raid5 array of the four disks you've got.

> My only question is this:  how the heck do I mount the RAID?

Did you put a filesystem on the device?

Hello Linux fokz,
I've hit this dilemma during new MySQl database 
installation with InnoDB tables support.
What concept is better to use for data storage?
Let database engine to operate with raw partition 
to store and manage the data or go with large data
files on a top of existing file system?

Thanks in advance for any advises or source of information.

If you run #rpm -Uvh * on a directory that contains all of the rpms on 
the 3 RH 8.0 disks, you will indeed install EVERYTHING in that directory.

If, however, you run #rpm -Fvh on that same directory, you will only 
upgrade (RH calls it "freshen") those RPMS that already exist on your 
system.

One thing about this. If they've packaged things differently, then you 
may end up with dependencies that require you to install (rpm -i) 
certain rpms.

It's much easier to use the installer that comes with the distribution 
and choose the "Upgrade" option. Make a backup of your existing system 
first.

First of all, you would want to use "-Fvh", not "-Uvh".  There is another 
reason why you don't want to do this...

If Redhat has changed how the package works, or the packages have picked 
up new dependancies, you will not get them.  Using upgrade will take care 
of these sort of things.  (Freshen does not look for changes in the 
required dependancies.)

Do you just want the sound card to play CDs, or will you be using
software to generate sounds (and possibly Midi) that you want to
play?  My experience has been that getting an all-around working
sound card is probably more difficult than most of the other common
cards.

I'm currently using a Sound Blaster Live card. But I think this
is probably somewhat "old" technology at this point.

So far, I've never been totally happy with any sound chipset that
came on a motherboard that I've had. Just today I gave up on using
the on-board sound on my new motheboard (in the previous threads
you might have seen) and put in the old Sound Blaster.

PS... I'm pretty much of a novice with audio hardware and the
associated drivers. So take the above with a grain of salt.

Message-ID: <3D9E61EA.5A6DFCD8@computer-arts.net>

When you install Red Had, it provides a program to partition
the hard drives. I *think* it's called "Disk Druid" (or something
like that)

Can anyone tell me if there's a way to invoke this particular
program to partition a new disk, when your not doing an install?
I can't find any reference to anything that appears to be it
using "apropos" or just looking through the normal "bin" directories.

  There's the old fashioned way: fdisk and, perhaps, cfdisk. The former is
installed on your system and you can invoke it to see what you have without
trashing anything. man fdisk

Well... I guess the honest response to that is, I can't figure out
how to use it :-)  I used to use it, once upon a time. But, for 
example, how do you tell it that you're using "ext2" or "ext3" file
systems?  It doesn't *seem* to be there in the known partition types.
(Or maybe that's not the right place to look)

Partition types and filesystem types are two different things.  Fdisk is 
for creating and modifing partitions and to a certain extent the type of 
filesystem you can place in the partition.  The filesystem utils are for 
creating/formatting the different types of filesystems; ext2, minix, 
ext3, etc.
   Disk Druid is a fancy front end to handle both things at once.

I just need something to play .wav and mp3 stuff.
I don't make music(ask anyone who has heard me sing)
Besides, I can only sing in the shower, in a town near Whitehorse,
with everyone else out of town. and all the wildlife free to run away.

I have heard that old technology is best :)

Onboard systems never really impressed me. When they break, it's
always twice as hard to repair/replace.


What I have going is a dual Xeon board that will be my new SCSI file
and print server. I need a pretty good Video card so I can keep track
of the day to day stuff until it gets burned in, and a sound card so I
can listen to the Irish Rovers and the Chieftains, while doing my
homework.

I take everything with a grain of salt. 
Sometimes with a wink and a nod.

My bear to cross is setting up my system to dial out to my ISP so I
can dump my windows box. Email and Browsing I still do using my
windows box. Printing, depends on what it is and how quickly I got to
have it.

Oh, and class work of course. The VB class I'm taking (instead of the
Java class I wanted) has required me to build a WINXP box because it's
a VB.net class(PCC knows no shame) So not only do I  get to install
and play with XP but I had to load a 4 gb program to do the work!
Worse, I had to BUY both products, which, even with student discounts,
is more than I make per month! Fortunately, I made the decision to use
hard drive mobile racks and can switch the machine (AMD k-6 500, 256
mb Ram, UltraSCSI 8gb HD's) between XP and Redhat 7.3. I am proud to
say I installed Redhat 7.3 Friday without the first hiccup or blart.

So, getting back to the subject, Sound card is for playing music while
I work.

  Try, as root, `/sbin/fdisk /dev/hda` (or whatever hard drive you want to
partition). You'll be prompted to enter "m for help". That gives you a menu
of options. The 'l' option lists all available filesystem types; the 'p'
option prints the existing partition table, and so on.

  The tune2fs tool permits you to turn on and off the journaling option.
That is how you can switch between ext2 and ext3.

Okay, well I had a go at this. The utilities I've got don't seem
to be able to create ext3 filesystems, but I did this:

(1) created a partition with fdisk
(2) used mkfs to make an ext2 filesystem
   (the details of these two commands are below the dotted line)

(3) using the Gnome "hardware browser" hdc1 *appears* to look
    like it should.

(4) the command:  mount -t ext2 /dev/hdc1 /data
    gives the following error msg:

    mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdc1,
    or too many mounted file systems

    Rebooting doesn't make any difference.

Can anyone help me out with what I'm doing wrong here?
(Or tell me how to run Disk Druid?)

Subject: [PLUG] mutt (re)formatting command
Message-ID: <20021005102750.A9354@defiant.ncplus.net>

In a previous version of mutt (redhat 6.x), there was a formatting
command that would take long-line paragraphs and 'fix' them - quoting
included. I used it for awhile, and then noticed that any editing in
the paragraph 'fix'ed it, even without the special command.

All I can remember of that command was that it was not intuitive,
and use a { in the command sequence .... I first discovered it in a
magazine article somewhere.

However, in my current version of mutt (I have always used vi as my
editor) that auto-fixing of edited long-line paragraphs is disabled,
and I don't know how to re-enable it; nor can I recall what that cool
re-formatting command is.

Any of you folks have a clue - that you could pass along?

TIA!

Create a journal on the filesystem using tune2fs and remount it as ext3:

$    tune2fs -j /dev/hdaX

Journal option info is available in the tune2fs manual. For info on
mounting in "writeback" or "ordered"  mode (ext3 v.2 features) see the
ext3 faq:

http://batleth.sapienti-sat.org/projects/FAQs/ext3-faq.html

I believe the syntax would be something like this to first convert to
version 2:

    mount /dev/hdaX /mnt -o journal=update

with 'ordered' as the default, writeback mode could be obtained with:

    mount -o data=writeback

> Can anyone help me out with what I'm doing wrong here?

Did you remember to create the mount point, ie "mkdir /data" ? That's
the thing I always forget... Otherwise, no clue.

g'luck,

Tyler

The one you're describing sounds like a vi command (or vim?).  I use vim
with mutt... If, in command mode, you press 'gq}', it will reformat from the
cursor to the end of the paragraph.  Similarly, 'gqj' will reformat the
current line.  And you can highlight area (vim only) using Shift-V, then
press 'gq' will reformat the whole area.

Okay, well it *appears* that the disk I've been trying to partition
may actually have been bad. I swapped in another hard drive and was
able to format and mount it, using fdisk and mkfs.

Thanks for all the help, especially the tips on how to change
ext2 to ext3.

There was some discussion earlier about forming a plug focus group to gain
a practical understanding of legal issues, ie stuff for sysadmins and
programmers. I noticed these "Law School in a Nut Shell" articles designed
to introduce law to the computer-oriented:

Part I:
http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=382

Part II:
http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=382

Is there still any interest in a PLUG-law focus group? I was thinking it
would be useful to bounce informal questions around and share legal
knowledge. Maybe call it PLUG-ianal ? :)

Find someone with a copy of spinrite if you want to take the time (10-20
hours) and install the possibly bad HD in a system, boot to DOS then use
spinwrite.  I've had it fix a couple of 'bad' drives that went on for
years.  I've also had then go down again in short order.
   When building a new system I always try to run spinrite on the hard 
drives is I have the time.  It will look for an correct errors that most 
other HD software just faints on.  Also a good way to burn-in the hard 
drives.

This is true. It's a function of what you've set as your editor... in my
case:

    [from .muttrc]
    set   editor="/usr/local/bin/gvim '+/^$' -f -c 'colo elflord' -c noh"

You can also map the reformat commands to something a bit easier to remember
and key, like...

    [from .vimrc]
    nmap <C-J>      gq}
    vmap <C-J>      gq

...to map them to ^J (the vmap is for visual mode, and maps the selected
area rather than the current paragraph).

Also of interest is how you've set formatoptions. Try `help formatoptions'
from within `vim' for the details.

Happy Vimming (as Bram would say :)

Bzzzt. Sorry, thank you for playing. Freshen _does_ check do a dependency
check before installing packages. The only difference between -U (upgrade)
and -F (freshen) is that -F "will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists" as per the RPM man page.

one would configure palm conduits.  It's like when my mom cleaned up my

how to configure conduits with this new version?  Thanks.

It's a Netgear FA511 PCMCIA which I think takes the tulip_cb.o driver.  However, the disk that came with the card has 2.2 kernel modules.  Where can I download 2.4.x kernel modules for PCMCIA?

I have the Tulip-like driver selected, but I cannot find tulip itself.  I
feel there's something fundamental I'm missing but I haven't found docs to
help me out.

Thanks,

DECchip Tulip (dc21x4x) PCI support
is under the PCI section.

However, at this page:
http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/201/2001/8/0/6478677/
shows how to edit your config for a 2.4.9 kernel.  May help your
current situation.

You might want tp try the one right above what you selected, if Xircom
Tulip-like Cardbus support (old driver) didn't work.

< > Xircom Cardbus support (new driver)

This driver is for the Digital "Tulip" Ethernet CardBus adapters. 
 It should work with most DEC 21*4*-based chips/ethercards, as well 
 as with work-alike chips from Lite-On (PNIC) and Macronix (MXIC) and  
 ASIX

I was wrong about tulip_cb as part of the kernel  pcmcia tree. I think now, the
doc I read, meant tulip kernel suppport was from the two Xircon drivers, hey
what do I know?  tulip_cb is part of the pcmcia_cs external drivers so you can
go get the tar ball and compile it. 

You might want to get the updated pcmcia_cs source, if	"(Did 3.1.22 really
ship with RH7.3?)" is true.

Does anyone out there have all 5 of the Red Hat 8 iso files? I've been having a very difficult time this weekend trying to download them. I ended up with discs 1 & 5, but no luck with the others. If someone has them, I have an ftp server that you could upload to and I can mirror them for the rest of the list.

gnapster depends on napigator to locate open-nap servers, unfortunately they recently changed the format of their server lists. It looks like somebody with programming skills could easily patch napigator.c to work with the new format.

Sorry I am not very clear of your comment.  M40G exists on WinXP under

C:\"My Network Places"\"Entire Network"\MS Windows Network"\SEC\M40G\Shared

>Has the smbpasswd file been initialized?

I have no smb password.  However I tried follow adding a new password but 
failed:

# smbpasswd
New SMB password:
Retype new SMB password:
unable to open passdb database.

For WinXP and 2000, you have to add a machine account to samba in order to
connect.

First, you need to add a machine account that matches the computer name you
plan to use:

"useradd -d /dev/null -s /bin/false M40G$"

The home folder is set to /dev/null since this account won't need to store
any files, and the shell is set to /bin/false for security purposes. The
trailing $ signifies that this is a machine account. Now that you have that
done, you need to add it to the smbpasswd file:

"smbpasswd -a -m M40G"

-a for adding an account, -m to signify it's a machine account.

That's it. Restart Samba and the WinXP box for good measure, and you should
be in business.

Hi All Guys,

I tried several days to get WinXP connected with Samba Server without 
success !!!

looking like connected but the shared folder did not show up

Hi, listers.

I'm looking for some information on Installing OpenLDAP RPMs, specifically
the Mandrake RPMs.

I've installed the RPM as follows:

	rpm -Uvh openldap-2.0.25-7mdk.i586.rpm

and it looks like it installs.

Great.

Now, Where the heck are the fles that I need to configure in order to make
it work???

I've searched for the slapd.conf file - not found

So, I scratches me head and I wonders - what did I miss?

TIA!

I believe the server itself is in the openldap-server package, rather
than the main package.

Sorry for the standard questions:

* what video chipset are you running?

* is gpm running?

* in /etc/X11/XF86Config, does the CoreKeyboard device defined in the 
  ServerLayout section match the keyboard InputDevice defined later 
  in the file? If so, does the keyboard definition look reasonable?

All;

I am giving away a Sequent 250 server. The server is running a fresh
installation of Dynix 4.4.4.

It has aroun 15 4G SCSI hard drives.

If you have a use for it, you can have it.

Subject: [PLUG] VPN needed for other OS
Message-ID: <1034018651.31782.126.camel@dereklinux>

Hi all,

I need some advise about secure tunnels.  I've been trying for the last
week to get a win2k machine to tunnel into an IPSEC deamon running on a
test box (configured for x509 certs).  This has been a very frustrating
experience, particularly since it still doesn't work, connection logging
on the client box shows nothing, and all the server says is "connection
not authorized".

First question, does anyone know of an alternative with about the same
level of security?

Second Question, can anyone give a short run down of how the ipsec
tunneling is supposed to work?  In particular, the documentation doesn't
say anything about iptables rules, yet ipsec looks for kernel support
for iptable, ipchains and ipfwd (or whatever that old one is).  Does
there need to be NAT rules in place for the tunnel, or does ipsec take
care of that?

I eagerly await your words of wisdom.

Derek Loree

i815, although RedHat thinks it's an ATI Rage 128.  If I boot into
runlevel 3, I can then run startx and run Gnome.  Xconfigurator is
apparently no longer around, so I used the RedHat Display tool to change
to the i815 (i810 driver), but then X wouldn't start at all after that and
I got "No devices detected" and "no screens found".  I did a "rmmod r128"
and then "insmod i810", but it still didn't work.  Under the Section
"Device" in XF86Config, the RedHat Display tool changed the Driver to
"i810" and the BoardName to "Intel 815", but left Identifier, VendorName,
and Device set to "ATI Rage 128".

> * is gpm running?

No.  If I turn on gpm, I can't use the keyboard in runlevel 3 either.

By 'RedHat Display tool,' do you mean /usr/bin/redhat-config-xfree86?
That seems to be the blest successor to Xconfigurator.

If you've got your hand on all the relevant specs for your monitor and 
video subsystem, you can always try the canonical XFree86 tool: 
/usr/X11R6/bin/xf86config.

That's a different set of modules entirely. The Linux frame buffer 
device is a stab at abstracting graphics hardware in order to allow 
Linux graphics software to run on a wider variety of platforms. IOW, 
that's kernel code, not XFree86 stuff.

M understanding is that there are relatively few occasions when you'd
need the fb abstraction on x86 hardware.

Drats. That's the easy answer :-)

The Xkb* options are not, as far as I can tell, very well documented, 
but this seems pretty sane to me.

It's under "System settings --> Display" in the "Hat menu".  And it's
apparently the same as redhat-config-xfree86...

I get the same errors as when I use redhat-config-xfree86.

Uh, yeah.  Well you didn't provide much info for what is a complex topic.  
And ipsec is a complex topic.  From what I know so far, the 
authenitacating part of ipsec, called isakmp, has problems with going thru 
NAT.  It stems from the fact that part of the authenciation mechanism uses 
the source ip address of the incoming packet, which is mangled during the 
NAT process.  Addressing freeswan specifically, there is  a patch out now 
called NAT-traversal which attempts to overcome this issue.  I'd refer you 
to the freeswan-users archives found at www.freeswan.org for further 
details about the patch.

Put these as the last two lines of your program:

    BEGIN { warn sprintf "after compilation: %.2f %.2f\n", times }
    END { warn sprintf "after execution: %.2f %.2f\n", times }

That's the user/system cpu time (in seconds) after compilation and
after execution.

I bet if your program is of any significant size and purpose, the
compilation time will be a very small fraction of the execution time.
Now think of how much *human* time you'll be spending keeping a
"binary" up to date, and also realize that the time to load an
entirely separate unshared binary will probably be more than the time
for the already memory-paged-in Perl executable (on most systems :) to
simply read the source and compile it.

In short, Perl's compilation time is nearly always not the issue, once
you look at it.

You're right, I didn't provide much info, mainly because there is so
much.  When I started, I used the instructions from:

http://www.natecarlson.com/include/showpage.php?cat=linux&page=ipsec-x509 
Nate claims that this works even with the client behind a masquerading
firewall.

What I'm fishing for with the second question is more like:

1) Server starts up, network interfaces start, ipsec interfaces start,
waiting for a connection.

2) Client starts a connection, sends initial packet (I think this is the
start of phase 1 using IKE).

3) Server responds to initiation, Phase 1 is successful if the client
replies back.  This establishes the tunnel (I think, I also assume this
is when the win2k client will start logging connection activity).

4) Client sends encryption needs back to server (initiation of Phase
2?).

5) Server generates encryption parameters (time of key rotation, etc.).

6) Client accepts encryption parameters and starts sending out encrypted
packets.  Now everything should work.

The part I don't get is how the packets go from the tunnel device
associated with eth0 (the internet side) to eth1 (the LAN side), Nate
says nothing about iptables rules, or special tunnels to the inside
interface.  He also has two seperate tunnels set up, one to the
interface with no subnet, and one to the LAN subnet, I don't understand
why.

Why am I fishing here?  Because I'm hoping for some real world
experience, not just a programmers version of what ought to happen.

Thanks

Ya, I think I see. There is another RPM that is openldap-server.

Actually, I got tired of trying to find the files and just downloaded the
source and installed it. Which was ANOTHER fun time for me.

Ya know, nothing that I recall reading (and maybe I don't read enough) talke
bout making links to libraries in the lib directory. There's alot of stuff
that is assumed, I believe. I had to poke around inside various files to see
what files and directories the programs were trying to access. Sheesh :P

I believe the server itself is in the openldap-server package, rather

Any time you want to find out where the files are loaded after
installing an RPM issue:

rpm -ql <package name>

Where package name is the short name of what you installed.  In this
case issue:

rpm -ql openldap

Since you are using a newer version of RedHat, do you suppose you are
using XF86Free 4.0.x?  Then you should look at the /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
configuration file for your settings.

If it's RH 8.0, then it's probably XFree86 4.2.0.

Thanks, but RH 8 doesn't have an XF86Config-4.  It's just XF86Config.  Oh
well, I'm back to RH 7.3 so I can actually get some work done at work...

Also, the reason 7.3 and below had a XF86Config-4 file was they shipped
with both 3.x.x and 4.x.x XFree and the XFree86 people added that
functionality for those people who needed one or the other or both.. 

Red Hat now only ships with 4.2.x and has moved back to just using
XF86Config as the configuration file.

when ipsec starts and ipsec interface is started with it, ipsec0 for 
example.  you can specify the name of the interface in ipsec.conf and bind 
it to specific interface like eth0.  when the tunnel is successfully 
created, ipsec should update the kernels routing table automagically so 
that packets destined for the far side of the tunnel will get routed to 
the appropriate ipsec0 interface.

I haven't read Nate's documentatiion (been meaning to) so I can't speak to 
it.  Two things I do recommend is going to either the www.freeswan.org or 
www.freeswan.ca website and rifling thru the documentation found there.  
And subscribe to the freeswan-users mail list.  It's probably the most 
free-form mail-list I've seen, definitely don't use a MS based MUA to 
peruse it.

The ppp options are: (/etc/ppp/options)

  lock
  crtscts
  defaultroute
  noauth
  noipdefault
  persist
  demand
  ipcp-accept-remote
  ipcp-accept-local

and the command string is:

 pppd /dev/ttyS1 115200 :$remoteIP remotename $isp user $user \
 connect "/usr/sbin/chat -v '' AT OK ATDT$phone CONNECT '\d\c'"

(yes, it's in a script so that I can use different isp's.) This is all
on dax, and anything I do on dax works just as advertised. ANY access
outside the local net causes the modem to dial (and to keep trying
until a connection is established); and once established, I can
browse, or ssh, or whatever I choose when at the dax console (or
logged into dax).

I also have squid running on dax, and the changes I made to the
squid.conf file are:

 http_port 80
 http_port 3128
 http_port 1080

 acl our_networks src 192.168.0.0/24

auger's default route is dax on eth0, and dax's default route is
ncplus on ppp0. But the only traffic on auger that will bring up dax's
modem is http. ssh, telnet, ping don't..... same is true on defiant
(the laptop) and additionally includes fetchmail and lynx. However,
konqueror on auger will cause dax's modem to fire up; but only because
I set the proxy page in konqueror on auger (with the proxy disabled,
no access to the modem).

ummm, I did add run an iptables command: (from the squid HOWto)

 iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -d 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128

is that a related step? where in the Fine manual do I look?

I'm running mutt and sendmail (and fetchmail and procmail). I'm OK
with the link coming up alot - the fone line was installed primarily
for data comm.

I didn't think so. But the proxy question arises....

I found in the sendmail faq (in the newsgroups) that you can get mail
that is stuck in the mqueue to move by running "sendmail -q<time>".
How do I put options on the commandline in the rc.d directories. Those
all seem to be soft-links; but I haven't seen any instructions on how
to add options to soft-links.

I want to do kernel profiling but I see no /proc/profile.
I restarted the kernel and passed a "profile=2"
statement to the kernel but still no /proc/profile. I
realize that I may have to compile profiling into the
kernel but I can't find kernel profiling in the menu
when I run make menuconfig. help.

I can use the SCSI drives for a RAID demo machine for
my classes.

Answering part of my own question:

The problem was Grub. Apparently, I still haven't
completely mastered grub.conf. I'd still like to know
whether kernel profiling is in all kernels or whether
it must be compiled in. A quick scan of the source
didn't give me the answer.

I have a functioning VPN between a Linux/FreeSWAN firewall and a Cisco

If anyone tries this particular combination, I found it necessary to add
"pfs=no" to my ipsec.conf for the tunnel to the VPN3000.

I didn't post it because I already solved the problem. When I said
that I haven't completely mastered Grub, I meant that I had to
go back to the documentation to figure it out I've not yet
memorized the details of grub.conf as I have for lilo.conf.

Then you missed a few items. One was profiling for User Mode Linux.
Cool stuff. It seems like every time I explore Linux source code
I find more cool things that cause me to steal time away from what
I'm supposed to be doing.

Remember, a mailing list like this is _not_ just for your own personal
gratification.  When you publicly ask a question, you are engaging the
minds of other people.  If you solve your own problem after you have
asked, both for those peoples curiosity and for posterity, I think it
is polite to outline what the solution was.  Think of it as the price
you pay for requesting free advice.  Just my opinion.

Subject: [PLUG] Problems using a Netgear PS 110 print server device from Linux
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0210081119410.1682-100000@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

    I'm setting up a Netgear PS 110 print server device.
This is a device to put your printers on a LAN a bit like an HP Jet
Connect.

    The Netgear PS 110 print server has a network connection and two
parallel ports.  The network connection is connected to the LAN,
and each of the parallel ports is connected to a printer, P1 and P2.
Windows PCs on the LAN can print to either printer.  So far I
have NOT been able to print to either printer from a Linux box
on the LAN.

    I should be able to print via samba, lpd, or ftp according to the
manual and I think the Netgear configuration supports this, but ...

    (1)  I can use a command like:
              smbclient -L PS330444 -I 192.168.0.4
         to get information about the supported services, but
         I can not print using smbclient like I normally can.
         When I try this nothing happens at either printer.

    (2)  I can use ftp to get to the Netgear box, read and write
         the Netgear configuration file, reset the box and so on.
         But, I haven't been able to ftp a file to either printer.

    (3)  I don't remember what happened when I used cups (lpd), but
         as I recall nothing happened.  I think the files justed
         queued up with the first one being active.

    Does anyone have an idea about this situation?
If so, we advise me.

                                          Sincerely,

Message-ID: <20021008191633.21480.qmail@web14403.mail.yahoo.com>

Can anyone give a thumbnail guideline for when someone might
want to prototype an application in perl, then rewrite it in
something faster for production use? Anyone have any examples
and real world speedups? Am I wrong in thinking that a lot
of the perl module functions are already written in C or other
compiled languages, so the performance gains in rewriting an 
application completely in C might not be worth it?

I'm asking this for the programmer neophytes among us,
myself included.

Thanks,

Sean Harbour

As always there are tradeoffs and it depends on your application.
As you implied, prototyping is generally a lot faster/easier in a
scripting language like Perl or Ruby than it is in C/C++ especially for
applications that include text processing(due to the ease of using regex's
in the scripting languages) and file access.  So using a scripting
language tends to minimize development time, but runtime may not be
optimal (again, depending on your application).

My understanding is that for text processing where regex's are used that
you are not likely to see much if any speedup by moving from Perl to C.
Other types of applications that might be mathematically intensive might
benefit from being rewritten in C.  However, in order to save development
time, you don't need to rewrite your whole Perl script in C, you can use
the Inline::C module (it's on CPAN) to rewrite the time consuming parts in
C.  Check out Inline::C, it's quite cool.  It allows you to basically
include C code in your Perl script.  The first time the C code is
encountered it is 'sent out' for compilation by gcc and then an extension
is created.  On subsequent runs compilation is not needed and the extension
code is called.  So Inline::C makes it easy to mix Perl and C to get the
best of both worlds - Perl for the things you wouldn't want to have to do
in C (like text processing and simple parsing) and C for the things that
are slow in Perl.  (there is also similar module for Ruby now called
RubyInline).

BTW: Another way to easily create extensions for scripting languages (most
of the well known ones are supported) is to use swig (simple wrapper
interface generator). (http://www.swig.org).  Swig is best for going the
other way: when you have a large C or C++ library around that you want to
be able to access from your scripting language.  I used swig to
generate extensions for Ruby (it'll work with Perl too) from a C++
class library when I was contracting at Intel and I cannot
recommend it highly enough. I also used it recently to create a Ruby
extension for a large public domain BDD library written in C - it
literally took about 15 minutes. Swig is a VERY slick tool and I'm always
surprised how well it does in 'guessing' what I wanted with minimal
intervention from me.  Anyway, with swig you can easily take an existing
C++ project, for example, and make all of your C++ classes available in
Ruby (or Perl, or Tcl, or even Java).  Swig is sooo much easier than the
traditional ways of creating extensions (like XSUBS in Perl) and you can
easily target multiple scripting languages mostly without changes.

...sorry for getting a bit off topic (I realize you're interested in going from
Perl -> C) but I just had to put in a good word for swig. ;-)

	I've been wanting to chime in on this kind of topic for 
awhile, now. So, please forgive the personal 
rant/musing/prognostications, but ...


	Web Development is DEAD, particularly in Portland. Business 
tends to have lousy Web sites. Too many "young turks" (names 
withheld, to avoid potential lawsuits) and opportunists that "took 
the money and ran" with no thought to proper construction or 
"Information Architecture" on the sites that they butchered.
	Business - particularly small business, which makes up nearly 
all of Oregon's offerings in this area - only cares that they HAVE a 
site, not how effective it is, how attractive and engaging it is, or 
how easy it is to navigate. I wrote an article about proper Web site 
design for ComputerBits magazine in November of 2000, and nearly all 
of that article is still applicable, today.

	With the IT crash about 2 years ago, nothing is going on in 
Web development - except falling salaries. What was paying decent 
money 2 years ago is now a secretarial position! Salaries are LESS 
THAN HALF (!!) of what they were in early 2000. With a Bachelor's 
degree in computer science and at least one major programming 
language (e.g. C, C++, Java, etc.) you MIGHT be able to get 40K a 
year ... maybe.
	My new motto is: "Friends don't let friends do Web development."


	Web site hosting is equally dead. With large NOC's like 
Exodus filing for bankruptcy, there is a tremendous GLUT of hardware, 
so hosting prices have fallen like a lead balloon. The hardware and 
infrastructure can't dissolve like wet toilet paper, so the companies 
that own it (or purchase at a deep discount) have to find a way to 
make their investment payoff.
	Whereas business Web site hosting used to command between $50 
and $100/month, it's now at $7.95!  ... That's right, you can now 
host a commercial Web site for about 1/3 of the cost of dialup - and 
get all of the "bells-n-whistles" (e.g. unlimited bandwidth, 
unlimited POP accounts, custom CGI, etc.)

	Programming is going overseas at a fast clip. U.S. 
programmers are about as "in demand" as stale potato chips. Most 
large-scale programming is going to India, Pakistan, or the former 
Soviet republics.

	There is some optimism about computer security positions as a 
growth market, but industry speculators aren't projecting this market 
to open up for about 18 months.

	http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,547669,00.asp

	My contact at the Portland Business Journal claims that she's 
having to work 10 times harder to get new advertising business, and 
is having trouble paying her bills as a result (she's obviously on 
commission).

	I think that it's very ironic that sales of computers 
continues to grow. MS viruses (and now Linux "Slapper") continue to 
proliferate at an alarming rate. However, no one seems to care about 
QUALITY or SECURITY in all but a few business sectors. Even the 
Oregon State Human Services department prefers to avoid spending any 
money on securing their (mostly Microsoft) system and ADMITS that the 
thing is WIDE OPEN.

	I keep wondering what it's going to take to wake these people 
up? ... some kind of high-tech "9/11" experience???

	:-(

Who gave them the money? Suits who wanted to get rich. Why did they give
them the money? Because they wanted to get rich. I want to do business. I
want to do meaningful work for a fair wage. Not get rich. So don't blame
"young turks" like me who do web development, because the wealthy were too
consumed with their greed to use good business sense.

Should we blame programmers here, or perhaps we can take a look at the
rich that control these companies, that make these decisions? EVERYTHING
is moving overseas. Crappy web developers didn't cause this.  Everything
is moving overseas here the labor laws are minimal or nonexistent. Where
the "elected" officials can be purchased more easily. Where environmental
laws don't exist. Where standards of living are lower and expectations for
wages lower. Not our fault.

Nothing will wake them up, probably. It's all about the bottom line. It
will continue to be from here on out. Not that it wasn't before, by the
hyperspeed greed that took over in the 90s is here to stay. The only time
it will go away is if the average guy wakes up and realizes that it's not
cool that he lost his job to someone being paid slave wages in India,
simply so his company could bump up the stock price a little higher for
the CEO to get a raise from $90million a year to $100million a year. Until
something jars the sheeple from their slumber it will continue. It will
probably take another Great Depression. That will no doubt come eventually
as the economy continues to stagnant under the weight of the income
descrepancies rampant in the economy.

Good afternoon.
I wrest your attention from your spleen-venting, ranting 
performances that belong on Plug-Talk (probably because I 
disagree with it, I want it stomped on. :) )

Anyhow. I've got a Linux box here, see? And it's running (no no 
don't leave!) Slackware version 8.1.  The card in is is from a 
disenfranchised macintosh; the //proc/pci lists it thusly: 

 Bus  0, device  16, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 
21140 [FasterNet] (rev 34).
      IRQ 10.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=20.Max Lat=40.
      I/O at 0xe880 [0xe8ff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xfebffe80 [0xfebffeff].

It's running Sendmail (no no don't panic) version 
220 mail.hotp.com ESMTP Sendmail 8.12.4/8.12.4

It works OK, except for some of these, which come from some 
(sigh) macs: 

Sep 24 08:24:17 mail sendmail[21510]: g8OFJIQI021510: 
SYSERR(root): collect: I/O error on connection from 
tech.hotp.com, from=<s_cobb at hotp.com>

My solution has been a non-solution. IE, "bugger it, I don't have 
time to fix it- most people can set their outbound mail server to 
be my computer. Let's do that."  It's worked, in the sense that the 
underlying problem is not solved, but the sufferers can get on 
with their lives.   My presumption is that there's something 
wrong with the cabling on that floor (shrug) that causes some 
sort of latency. (the building could stand a good re-cabling).

However, now I am working on a perl script that downloads 
information from the web server. And I don't have log messages 
for this problem, but here's the symptoms. . . 
1)  Web server is IIS/Windows. Perl script uses Net::FTP and 
downloads a list of files in ascii mode. Random files seem to 
lose all line / file endings, generating an error.  When I say 
"random", I mean that there doesn't seem to be any coorelation 
between files that are selected for this mistreatment, but 
subsequent attempts to download the file are also bad. I don't 
mean that 4 our of 5 files download OK and the next day that 
last file has a 4 in 5 chance of downloading- it has 0 chance.

2) When it generates an error, the file is not removed from the 
server and not saved locally (I have a backlog of about 1300 
files).  However, viewing the file in Windows gives me proper 
line endings.

2a) I've tried using ncftp to download each file in binary / ascii. It 
does not help - the file comes down the way it decides to come 
down. This would lead me to believe that this is file-related; 
however, the files are created by two automatic processes (they 
are catalog requesting forms) and the process is identical.

3) Occasional ftp sessions "time out" for some unknown reason 
(it says the server has closed connection).

In other words- FTP has also a mysterious ailment. There's a 
subtle connection between FTP and Sendmail- they use the 
network card.

The network statistics look like this: (ifconfig eth0)
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:94:AD:93:96  
          inet addr:10.10.10.45  Bcast:10.10.10.255  
Mask:255.255.255.0
          EtherTalk Phase 2 addr:65280/53
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  
Metric:1
          RX packets:31584334 errors:1 dropped:0 overruns:0 
frame:0
          TX packets:27420007 errors:90 dropped:0 overruns:0 
carrier:180
          collisions:0 
          RX bytes:3049054126 (2907.8 Mb)  TX 
bytes:1644590675 (1568.4 Mb)

I'm not that worried about the TX errors: the box has been up for 
76 days. Before I got this box switched to another network 
segment, this number was ... excessive (on the scale of multiple 
hundreds of collisions per hour).

--------------
So the question I have today is ...
Would replacing the card in the Mail server have a greater than 
50 percent chance of helping the problems with Mail and FTP- 
or do you suppose there's another underlying reason for this? 

The card in my linux box seems to work well. Maybe I should 
just swap cards temporarily?
----------------
Russ, mildly confused.

	I'm sorry, but I just don't buy into the "as I'm just a lowly 
consultant, I'm powerless over this stuff" kind of mentality.
	My kind of consultant is not much different than a doctor or 
lawyer ... I don't let clients control every aspect of the process. 
For instance, I don't tell my doctor how to treat me, medically. I 
also don't tell my lawyer how to write a contract. By the same token, 
I don't accept a client's process or procedure. That's what they are 
paying ME for!

	Obviously, it's different for folks like you.

"Linux, along with Solaris, also came out ahead of Windows in terms of
administration costs, despite the fact that it's less expensive to hire
Windows system administrators. The average Windows administrator in the
study earned $68,500 a year, while Linux sys admins took home $71,400, and
those with Solaris skills were paid $85,844. The Windows technicians,
however, only managed an average of 10 machines each, while Linux or
Solaris admins can generally handle several times that."

"There were other costs the study was not able to quantify, according to
Robinson, such as security. While study participants were reluctant to
provide hard figures on the costs of security breaches, it appears that
the "cost for handling security issues on Windows systems was very high,"
says Robinson. The study revealed that Windows administrators spent twice
as much time patching systems and dealing with other security-related
issues than did Solaris or Linux admins. "

http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-10-08-016-26-NW-BZ-MR

This segment of the study also looked interesting:

"Windows owners are responsible for ensuring that they comply with
Microsoft's licensing policies by maintaining inventories of software
products installed. Microsoft has threatened audits and lawsuits where it
believes companies have violated those policies.

Partially out of a fear of such legal action and the penalties that they
may carry, many companies have implemented costly software inventory
products to perform these audits internally. These products may range from
$5 to $50 per seat, depending on their functionality. Because Linux and
Solaris are not licensed in this fashion, companies that use these
products do not need to fear such penalties."

	I've been wanting to chime in on this kind of topic for 
awhile, now. So, please forgive the personal 
rant/musing/prognostications, but ...


	Web Development is DEAD, particularly in Portland. Business 
tends to have lousy Web sites. Too many "young turks" (names 
withheld, to avoid potential lawsuits) and opportunists that "took 
the money and ran" with no thought to proper construction or 
"Information Architecture" on the sites that they butchered.
	Business - particularly small business, which makes up nearly 
all of Oregon's offerings in this area - only cares that they HAVE a 
site, not how effective it is, how attractive and engaging it is, or 
how easy it is to navigate. I wrote an article about proper Web site 
design for ComputerBits magazine in November of 2000, and nearly all 
of that article is still applicable, today.

	With the IT crash about 2 years ago, nothing is going on in 
Web development - except falling salaries. What was paying decent 
money 2 years ago is now a secretarial position! Salaries are LESS 
THAN HALF (!!) of what they were in early 2000. With a Bachelor's 
degree in computer science and at least one major programming 
language (e.g. C, C++, Java, etc.) you MIGHT be able to get 40K a 
year ... maybe.
	My new motto is: "Friends don't let friends do Web development."


	Web site hosting is equally dead. With large NOC's like 
Exodus filing for bankruptcy, there is a tremendous GLUT of hardware, 
so hosting prices have fallen like a lead balloon. The hardware and 
infrastructure can't dissolve like wet toilet paper, so the companies 
that own it (or purchase at a deep discount) have to find a way to 
make their investment payoff.
	Whereas business Web site hosting used to command between $50 
and $100/month, it's now at $7.95!  ... That's right, you can now 
host a commercial Web site for about 1/3 of the cost of dialup - and 
get all of the "bells-n-whistles" (e.g. unlimited bandwidth, 
unlimited POP accounts, custom CGI, etc.)

	Programming is going overseas at a fast clip. U.S. 
programmers are about as "in demand" as stale potato chips. Most 
large-scale programming is going to India, Pakistan, or the former 
Soviet republics.

	There is some optimism about computer security positions as a 
growth market, but industry speculators aren't projecting this market 
to open up for about 18 months.

	http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,547669,00.asp

	My contact at the Portland Business Journal claims that she's 
having to work 10 times harder to get new advertising business, and 
is having trouble paying her bills as a result (she's obviously on 
commission).

	I think that it's very ironic that sales of computers 
continues to grow. MS viruses (and now Linux "Slapper") continue to 
proliferate at an alarming rate. However, no one seems to care about 
QUALITY or SECURITY in all but a few business sectors. Even the 
Oregon State Human Services department prefers to avoid spending any 
money on securing their (mostly Microsoft) system and ADMITS that the 
thing is WIDE OPEN.

	I keep wondering what it's going to take to wake these people 
up? ... some kind of high-tech "9/11" experience???

	:-(

Two things.

First off, this depends in part on what kind of consultant you are. I've
worked since graduating from college in 97, for companies. I've never been
an independent consultant or even a terribly highly paid consultant with
lots of pull or influence. I make the right decisions technically, I try
as hard as I can to influence the clients my company works with to make
the right decisions, but in the end I only have so much power. I'm the one
being paid. They don't have to listen to me.

Which brings me to part 2. If someone makes triple or more than I do to
make business decisions and still doesn't listen to me (which happened to
many of us in the tech field) then how does that make it our fault? Should
we have quit our jobs in protest? I need to eat. So if my employer tells
me to go do some programming and I know their business plan sucks, I may
tell them so, but I still need to pick up a pay check so I won't push it
TOO hard, otherwise my family will end up poor and destitute.

This is what I don't get. If CEOs, managers and executives don't get paid
to make good business decisions, what the hell do they get paid so much
for?

I understand. I just wanted to clarify that when talking about taking the
money and running there's a difference between the programmer picking up
his paycheck and the suits which lead the client astray because they want
the money. They generally run the show both for the client and the
consultancy (at least in most situations I've been involved with). Not the
programmer.

When you're a consultant that isn't independent, this has to be your
mentality. Remember, there's a difference between independent consultant
and someone working as a consultant for a company. In the latter position
you have suits above you who will often supercede your good advice with
their desire to please the client, even if it's not the best idea. You
either have to learn to live with bad choices or quit. I choose to feed my
family. My bad.

What does that mean? Folks like me? Folks who work for companies that pay
their salaries and don't want to lose their jobs by speaking out too much?

Has anybody else seen this problem while attempting to install RH Linux 8.0?

I am unable to install my RH 8.0 personal due to issues with anaconda.
There are a number of problems with anaconda that lead to a message that
states: "OSError: [Errno 12] Cannot allocate memory".  I'm unable to save
the complete error message to a floppy disk to submit to bugzilla or to
here.  My pc freezes at this point.

This error occurs after I've selected the packages that I want to install.
I'm not sure what's going on, but if any of you have seen this or heard
about it, please let me know.  The Red Hat site does not help at all.  In
fact, it's a piece of dung.  Everything that pertains to RH 8 leads to a
dead webpage.

TIA,

Don't know the specific answer, but will offer this.  I've been 
configuring a replacement mail server just recently and was experiencing 
network outages of either painfully slow or out right dead.  When I 
finally got around to doing an ifconfig I noticed the RX errors.  Not 
many, but it would increment.  After too much troubleshooting I replaced 
the patch cable and that fixed the problem.  Overall I learned that RX 
errors are really hard on network performance and reliability.

Subject: [PLUG] Yet another RH8.0 failed install
Message-ID: <28533.209.210.3.17.1034117410.squirrel@webmail.woo-hoo.com>

I have this HP Vectra VL which, as long as I pass the "no-hlt" parameter
to the kernal, worked perfectly using RH7.3.  I just tried the "upgrade"
but then did a clean install of RH8.0 and it fails upon booting.  The last
line output is:

Freeing unused kernel memory: 212k freed

It simply halts after this point and is unresponsive to any keys.

Even when booting off of the boot floppy it stops in the same place.

Any suggestions on what could be causing this type of failure?

Thanks for your help.

Try the text.  I have had some trouble with the graphical in other version
and the text always worked for me.  At the start type text.

The graphical worked well on RH 7.2 and 7.3.  I'm aware that there were
problems with graphical installs on 6 or 6.1.  But what the hey, I'm not
getting any where with it up to this point.

Every so often I run into problems with the graphical 
installs.  The text is a bit more robust.  I just 
finished installing 11 machines via PXE with the 8.0 
release candidate, worked fine on all.  (A bunch of P-II 
thru P-III machines.)  Once we get the release in, I'll 
run it again.

I once worked for a company where I was asked to hack into message boards
and find out the names of people who were posting messages about the
company to drive the stock down. I quit promptly and contacted the SEC.
However, part of the reason I quit, is because I knew in a showdown with
management I would be fired or worse. That's corporate America.

Tony,

  Happens in different ways. I've been making my living for the past 10
years consulting to a market my former employer told me had no potential.
I've no idea what they're doing, but they pulled out of the
Portland/Northwest market years ago. I'm still here.

This subject has probably been beaten to death before,
but if so, I missed it. My cockatiel chewed through
the cable of my primitive mouse, and I replaced it
with a Logitech optical wheel mouse. (I'm going to
keep the cockatiel away from this one.)

The new mouse works fine with Linux, despite the fact
that Logitech makes no mention of this OS. But it
doesn't support the wheel feature, just as the old one
did not. Is there a way to get such support with Linux?

I have a logitech mouse with a wheel.  To get it working, I just kept
trying different protocols in gpm until I found one that worked.

The protocol change "IMPS/2" worked for me as well.  Most applications
seem to work with the mouse wheel.  (So far the only one I have that
doesn't is the Adobe Acrobat reader.)

Now my only problem is on my mouse the wheel serves as a third button so I
keep pasting things in by accident...

Dilbert cartoons go back a number of years and were around when I worked 
at this company. We had a bulletin board in the coffee room and every 
morning someone would posted the absolute perfect Dilbert cartoon that 
had the same tone and "flavor" that the executives had sent out to the 
company employees for the previous day.

The cartoon was posted sometime between 0600-0700 and would be promptly 
removed by the first executive that entered the building. I was usually 
in the office by 0730 and got to see the daily cartoon board.

Bruce,

I didn't see another reply, so I'll chime in. Change the value of QUEUE in
/etc/sysconfig/sendmail and then restart sendmail. The default is

    QUEUE=1h

You can change that to

    QUEUE=5m

to have it attempt to flush the queue every 5 minutes rather than once an
hour. See /etc/init.d/sendmail for how that value is put to use.

I leave it at the default and just `sendmail -q' as root from the command
line on the rare occasions that warrant some percussive persuasion :)

Specifically, the compilation of the oggtst package which supports the
ogg format doesn't work as RH changed the directory location of automake
between 7.3 and 8.0.  But it's more problematic than that, as I can't
get the make command to work for oggtst.  Anyway, if anyone has figured
out how to compile oggtst in RH 8.0, I would really appreciate it. 
Thanks!

When programmers cost $5/hr and CPUs are $10 per mhz, it might
make sense to rewrite Perl into something else.

We crossed the line a long time ago where programmer time was a lot
more expensive than CPUs.

Stop looking for false economy.

I'll agree with this, and in fact I've often been impressed by perl's
speed.  More than once it's actually outperformed my C code just because
the perl developers have spent so much time tweaking and optimizing
things.  (especially the text parsing and regex bits)  The only real slow
part is the startup time, and that is quite bearable for anything with an
overall runtime over about 1 second.

However, if you have something that only runs for 100ms, then that perl
startup overhead becomes more critical.  I'm impatient, but even I can
wait 200-500ms for perl to load and compile.  ;-)

I see now that the 'sendmail' in the rc.d tree is a script, rather
than an executable like the one in the /usr/sbin dir.

two other files, it turns out....

the interval defaults to 1 hour.... interesting value.

yeah. I've found that the Portland group sometimes responds quicker,
or has different useful experience. So, now that I'm stuck over on the

I think that's implied when you ask q to repeat every so often, altho
it's not specifically stated in the docs I read. Maybe I'll have to
get the bat book.

There are commands in the man page that describe how to list the
hosts, but I don't appear to have any. There are not commands
documented on how to change that. There was also a comment on the
single threaded issue related to small memory capacity. I should
probably use that, since all my mail is on my laptop, a 50 Mhz 486
with 20MB of ram.

Still looking for those expanded docs.

Hi Ben,

I have no luck.  Problem still remains

At 09:12 AM 10/7/2002 -0700, you wrote:
>"useradd -d /dev/null -s /bin/false M40G$"

It went through without complaint.

>"smbpasswd -a -m M40G"

It went through without complaint, not requesting for adding password

stop ipchains and restart  Samba

# mount
/dev/hde2 on / type ext3 (rw)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
usbdevfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbdevfs (rw)
/dev/hde1 on /boot type ext3 (rw)
none on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
none on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
none on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type binfmt_misc (rw)
//M40G/Shared on /mnt/WinXP type smbfs (0)

One thing I could not understand.  It seems mounted but with a (0) content.


Backside Story
===========
Previously this hard drive ran RH7.3 with Samba server installed also 
having problem in connecting WinXP (the same WinXP under this test).  Samba 
server could see WinXP and its shared folder for file transfer without any 
problem.  But WinXP could not see Samba server.  The smb.conf file was a 
basic Samba config file similar to this one now used.  Unfortunately I have 
not saved the original file for future use.  After installing Samba-2.2.31 
coming with RH7.3 CDs, the setup was quite simple without much work, no 
password requested, no Administrator added to Samba, etc.   But It worked 
one-way only.  Later I made a fresh installation of RH7.3 erasing the old 
one. Now both ways are blocked.

Thanks

Stephen Liu

Message-ID: <20021009020510.G24087@defiant.ncplus.net>

Ok. the reference - I'm running RedHat 7.2

What I found, after all those nice hints came in.

/usr/sbin/sendmail is the main executable.
/etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail is a script that runs at boot.
/etc/sysconfig/sendmail contains two envars:
	DAEMON=yes
	QUEUE=1h
/etc/mail/sendmail.mc contains directives for updates to ....
/etc/sendmail.cf contains the specific local instructions; among which is:
	MinQueueAge=30m meaning a msg must stay in the queue for 30m.

This implies to me that if I send a message, it will first go to the
queue and wait for a half hour. This would explain why, when I wait
for mutt to say "message sent" and then immediately drop pppd, that
the message doesn't get sent until the next time that I start pppd;
but then only actually gets sent if I keep pppd up for at least an
hour (or a multiple of an hour from when sendmail was started).

Because of that (I think), I found some messages still in the queue
after several days, which is what initiated this dialogue. I originally
set the queue.warn to 4 days (up from 4 hours) and the queue.return
to 35 days (up from 5 days) due to the fact that I was having to find
someone elses DSL pipe or dialtone to collect my email. I would then
answer and reply between visits, and it was typical to be several days
before I could reconnect to the internet. Even tho I have dialtone in
my house now, I haven't reverted those settings yet -- incase I take my
laptop somewhere else on a vacation (a what?).

I added "sendmail -q15m" to my ppp dialer script after the actual dial
command. perhaps that should be moved to ip-up? or maybe it's moot on
my next reboot, since I changed the /etc/sysconfig/sendmail QUEUE
value to 15m.

I haven't found any instructions for m4 on how to address sendmail.cf
settings that aren't included in the default sendmail.mc file. I just
perused the "info m4" doc, but found nothing specific to sendmail. It
was interesting to learn that 'dnl' means 'delete to newline'.

I haven't found the command that tells me which version of sendmail
I'm running. I know I updated it in April 2002 to whatever was latest
at that time, but I can't remember the syntax for learning that sort
of info.

Thanx again everybody!

`locate README.cf'

On my distro, it's "/usr/share/doc/sendmail/README.cf".

Sandy already showed how to get this information by telnet, so I will just
note that Sendmail stamps its version number in all outgoing mail:

Received: (from brucek at localhost)
        by defiant.kingkon.com (8.11.6/8.11.6) id g9995Dr24903;
        Wed, 9 Oct 2002 02:05:13 -0700

if I remember correctly, the format is
(sendmail.cf version/binary version)

I didn't have par as part of the RH7.2 distro, so I first set this up
with fmt. It worked, sortof, but not as I remembered the old command.
So, I went out and found par with tuxfinder, and got Par152; compiled
it per the instructions (no handy .configure, or install - but put a
link into the same dir as fmt, and got all the dir/file permissions
tweaked). And I do like the way it works.

And now _I_ resemble this remark.

mine's in the .vimrc -- haven't found where the old vi is better yet.

Hi Stephen,

I didn't catch that you were trying to mount a Windows share on the linux
box...I've never tried that so I won't be much help. However, maybe my
smb.conf can help you at least get the WinXP box access to the samba server.
This setup is currently running, and my WinXP box can connect to shares and
transfer files. I've made no modifications to the WinXP box other than
setting it's workgroup.

   server string = Samba Server

   hosts allow = 192.168.1. 127.

I'm sure it's not the reccommended way to do it, but I
find that "telnet localhost 25" works quite well. Then
the SMTP command "QUIT"

Just edit the original file (the file it links too).

Depending on the OS, you may see that the original SysV startup script
gets its configs from another file.

Every startup script for starting a sendmail daemon already has it run the
queue at some set interval (like 30 minutes).

On systems that don't have a listening mail server (no -bd), then I just
do a "sendmail -q" (no time interval) via cron.

(I see that this is carbon-cpioed to a list I am not subscribed too. If it
doesn't bounce: "hello Portland!")

If you're someone who is a "jack of all trades" you can still get work...I

I know that there's the smart_wrap option, but that only controls the
formatting in the pager. I haven't ever seen a reformatting command
for mutt.

Searching the mutt documentation didn't turn up anything particularly
useful.

I just use VIM and just do 'gqip' when I need to reformat text.

You don't need -bd to have it run as a daemon and periodically run the 
queue.  'sendmail -q<time>' will start still a deemon, even without -bd. 
  If you also add -bd on the command line, it will listen in addition to 
periodically running the queue; if not, it won't.

If you're running the queue very often, you might want to take a look at 
some sendmail options: persistant host status and single threaded delivery.

Persistent host status will prevent it from trying to connect to down 
hosts every time it runs, and single thread delivery will keep multiple 
simultaneous queue runs from competing with each other to talk to the 
same host.  Both of these have issues though; review the sendmail docs 
before trying to enable them.

I understand -- that is why I said "listening" and my example showed only
running queue a few times a day.

On some of my systems, I run a sendmail replacement (called mailout) which
I wrote. It can't listen for port 25 connections. It is a light-weight
replacement for a real smtp server which often is not even needed on most
systems.

Thanks for the info. Exim has similar features, such as queueing multiple
messages to particular domains so they can sent in a single connection.

These days, on my real mail servers, I use Exim and sometimes postfix.
(Although I continue to do work with sendmail and qmail when it comes
a long.)

It is great that there is such a variety of good software to choose from.

The mail should be attempted to be sent immediately. Then if it
temporarily fails, then it will need to wait 30 minutes between queue
runs. Note: generally you do not need to ever have a -q queue run, unless
you have mail that couldn't successfully be sent in the first place.

You should look at your mail logs (/var/log/mail.log or /var/log/maillog
or similar) to see what is happening to your message. Each message can
have multiple log entries (lines).

That will start a daemon each time. You don't need the "15m" time
interval.

I use:

Subject: [PLUG] Redhat 8.0 at a glance...NICE!
Message-ID: <005e01c26f27$7ed63390$6501a8c0@Endeavor>

There are surely tons of reviews, so I won't go into it much, but in a
word....NICE.

The new Gnome desktop is sharp.  On my IBM A30 all hardware except for
my PCMCIA wifi 802.11 wireless internet card was detected.

OpenOffice.org 1.0 is standard, as is Mozilla 1.0 (the latter is out in
1.1 as of this writing).  There are launcher ("shortcut" icons)" on the
lower left panel to launch the word processor, spreadsheet, and
presentation (like PowerPoint).  Ximian Evolution is an excellent mail
client similar to Outlook.  All have configured well right out of the
"box".

I do instant messaging, and gaim really delivers on a cross-database
level...ICQ and Yahoo configured well.  ICQ worked as is...uses the same
AOL network since they have owned it for about 4 years now.  Yahoo
required the loading of a simple plugin - which I found out with a quick
click on HELP and the FAQ.  Like Trillian has done for Windows, we have
it all in one package.  It's not my ideal client, but it's nice.

Mozilla continues to work well, as it does for me in Win.  I especially
like the ability under Advanced Options to DISABLE "open unrequested
windows."  Popups and those especially evil POPUNDERS...are GONE.  No
third party app to kill them.

I resented not having a terminal launcher on the panel, but that was
easily corrected.

A big music fan, XMMS does not play MP3's out of the box.  One fellow
suggested it's because Redhat does not want to get into the controversy
of supporting the mp3/CD piracy thing....I don't know, I'm an engineer,
not a lawyer or a politician. Regardless, www.xmms.org has an easy
update that will tackle the problem.  I should point out that I couldn't
find a launcher for XMMS, though it still launched from command line.

We still need to see a HIBERNATE feature...which is one of the most
wonderful features I have ever seen being a laptop user.

I run Linux mostly as a server...it chugs faithfully away when I leave
town and I don't worry about it much. After dual-booting my laptop
between WinXP and Redhat 8.0...I will run it a lot more.  Now if the
kernel developers can just get the extra mile and get us that hibernate
feature...

Subject: [PLUG] Any ThinkPad owners in the area?
Message-ID: <3DA49A00.3010602@day-reynolds.com>

I recently picked up a used ThinkPad 560 cheaply (<$150) on Ebay, and 
I've managed to squeeze a minimal Debian setup on the hard drive by 
mounting it temporarily in an external FireWire case, and running the 
install from my desktop workstation. However, the machine did not come 
with the standard external floppy drive, and as far as I can tell from 
documentation searches and a day or so of experimentation, there's no 
way to install a bootloader on one machine, and then move the disk to 
another -- prob. something to do with the BIOS-based disk access code, 
but bootloaders and assembly at that level are all black magic hoodoo to me.

So, if anyone out there on the list has a ThinkPad 560/570/600/whatever 
with an external bootable floppy drive, and is willing to let me use the 
drive for an hour or so, I would be happy to buy you coffee/a beer/some 
lunch/etc. for the favor. The install really is done, and I just need to 
boot the machine once to finish getting the bootloader set up. 
Alternately, if anyone has a spare drive sitting around, I'd be more 
than willing to see if we can't negotiate a fair price (the guy who sold 
me this box wants $40, plus another $20 shipping and handling, which 
seems a bit steep for something I'm literally only going to need while 
re-installing the OS).

Hello Linux folkz,
I'm sorry for these strange questions

After reading 
"Web Performance Tuning"
2nd Edit. 2002 by Patrick Killelea 
Pub.O'Reily. ISBN 0-598-00172-x  

I have the following assumptions:

Linux kernel uses buffered IO file access 
when it's reading and writing to the physical 
partition/device with its native FS.

Linux kernel uses unbuffered IO file access 
if a program (e.g. DB engine) reads and writes 
to the raw partition/device.
I assume it's because DB engine handles its
data transaction on raw device/partition 
without going through the kernel IO calls.
 
Does all above apply to the case if drives 
support DMA?

Why it's nessesary to bind raw devices to block devices
( bind /dev/raw/raw1 to /dev/hdb1 )
if a database engine reads and writes to the raw partition
without such binding?

Will this binding improve performance of the DB engine or
this needs to be done only in order to read from Linux what
has been written on a raw device?

Thank you in advance for any answers or sources of further
information.

Alex

So I created my own test which looks for a string in the full email and
I successfully flag it as spam by assigning a score.

Now, instead of flagging email from this test, can I

I've just been given a dell server at work to show them RH linux for an
intranet at the hospital that I work at. I'm trying to show them linux with
apache as opposed to windoze with IIS.  It has Windoze 2000 already

create two partitions.  How do I go about installing Red Hat at that point
in order to make it a dual boot machine.  I looked at the archives back
several months and saw that someone wanted to have linux in the MBR and
windows at hdb or something.

I'm not really sure about this.  I understand that I'll have to load linux
in the second partition and also load the linux bootloader such as GRUB or
LILO.

What will I see when I start the install of linux?  Will RH 8 see the ntfs
partition and then show the linux partitions?  Will I be booting up with
GRUB or the windows loader initially?

TIA,

Jim

You could always remove the Win2K drive, pop in a fresh drive and install

I have almost the same thing running here at work, a Windows 2000 box with
Slackware 8.1 dual booting.  LILO always takes over the booting (for me at
least).  It's easy to do, just as long as Windows is installed first.

I haven't used Redhat 8.0 but if it's like the rest of the Linux distros,
it should behave the same way.  Might even prompt to mount NTFS drives
somewhere during the install.

After you have shrunk the Win partition with PMagic, begin RH install
(don't create Linux partitions yet).
Use Disk Druid of fdisk to create Linux and swap partitions (don't tell it
to partition everything automatically, it'll wipe out the disk).
It'll want to install GRUB into MBR, let it. It probably won't recognize
NTFS, I think NTFS mounting is still experimental, unless RH enabled it in
their kernel (if it was FAT32 it would mount it).
It'll also give you an option to add the other OS to GRUB, tell it to do
it.
Then you choose which one to boot from GRUB and everything works fine.
That is, if your PC supports booting from second partition of the disk. If
it's a relatively old PC and the disk is IDE, it won't work because the
BIOS can't get to the disk above 1024 cylinders. Then what you do is this:
you move your Win partition with PMagic to open up a small partition at
the beginning of the disk, 10M is fine. Then in Disk Druid you tell RH to
mount the small partition as /boot and the big partition at the end of the
disk as /. The rest is the same, and it configures GRUB automatically to
deal with the /boot partition.

  I really need some help on this issue; I've been fighting it for several
weeks now without success. The problem is the reverse of spam blocking: it's
sending and receiving mail that should _not_ be blocked according to my
postfix filters.

  For example, here's one I just tried sending that bounced back to me:

Subject: Undelivered Mail Returned to Sender
----------------------------------------

This is the Postfix program at host salmo.

I'm sorry to have to inform you that the message returned
below could not be delivered to one or more destinations.

For further assistance, please send mail to <postmaster>

If you do so, please include this problem report. You can
delete your own text from the message returned below.

                        The Postfix program

<pjcogan1 at hotmail.com>: Domain.

  Now, much as I would love to reject hotmail.com and all the other no-cost
e-mailers, I cannot. The problem here is that 'hotmail.com' is not in any of
my recipient_check or sender_check map files. The only two records are:

[root at salmo /etc/postfix]# grep hotmail.com *
body_checks:/pleasestopsending at hotmail.com/ REJECT Spam rejected.
header_checks:/^From: <BeatriceTinsley at hotmail.com>/ REJECT Sender.

  In neither of these two instances, both with specific usernames, is the
reason the domain. The only instance of "Domain" is in header_checks, and
there's no instance there of hotmail.com! I'm totally bamboozled why postfix
is rejecting this message when I try to send it.

  I also have legitimate mail rejected when there is are question marks in
the subject, but not when there's a single question mark. That's another one
that has me completely baffled for there are no instances of question marks
in header_checks except at the end of specific subject lines.

  Some erroneous filtering I've finally figured out myself (the daily log
rotation of /var/log/maillog has _really_ helped me there). For example, I
was losing mail on a mail list from a user of the British ISP, virgin.net,
because 'virgin' is one of the postfix trigger words. I also had to
explicitly OK two ISPs in Nevada to prevent messages via their servers being
rejected.

  Help, please! :-)

TIA,

Rich

No, the DB will still need to use kernel I/O calls.  (I.e read() or
write() system calls.)  Without those calls the DB would need to know how
to talk directly to the hardware, and that would defeat much of the
purpose of the OS.  ;-)  I.e. your database would need to know your disk
SCSI ID, drive type, SCSI card, etc. etc.

This happens below the level at which an database interfaces with the
OS.  Databases have no knowledge of whether your drives use DMA or
not.  You can have both raw and block divices on any type of hard drive,
DMA or no DMA.

Here's a description of the data flow from your database to your disk, on
a sample disk write.  For you nitpickers, keep in mind this is appreviated
for clarity and is not 100% technically perfect.  ;-)

1) database
2) system call (i.e. "write()")

4) OS filesystem driver (unless DB is on raw/block disk, then skip this)
5) OS buffer cache (unless DB is on raw disk, then skip this)
6) OS block device driver [not sure if this is before or after RAID/LVM]
7) LVM driver (if used)
8) RAID device driver (if used)
9) SCSI/IDE driver

Linux doesn't bind a particular raw device to a particular block
device.  Most other unixes use something like /dev/dsk/<block> +
/dev/rdsk/<char> where the <block> and <char> device names are the same.

I think the actual command used is "raw /dev/raw/raw1 /dev/hdb1" based on
your example.

This is needed to tell linux unambiguously where to find the data for that
raw device.  ;-)  Look at "man raw" for more info.  It does not appear to
be optional, so it's not a performance question.

My take on the raw interface is that it's kind of klugy.  Linux was built
with block devices from the beginning, and working around them is likely
to result in finding more bugs than you might find otherwise.  ;-)

Indeed, if the intention is to compare performance, Apache would be at a
disadvantage on a second generation partition. Among other issues,
Apache's I/O will take much longer because it must read and write to the
center of the disk, whereas IIS will get the speedy outer rim.

The sad thing is, I think Apache would still come out ahead. :)

OK. I have a few minor corrections, but I am not a kernel developer either.

Well, I lied about minor correction.  This got long.  Sorry, I deal with 
databases and filesystems all day long as a systems architect, so it tends 
to leak over :-)

Steve's got this right.

_All_ normal block device access goes through buffering.  This buffering 
has been called various things in Linux.  In 2.2 there were buffers for 
reading and writing.  In 2.4, that was unified to one cache.  In 2.5/6 
they're changing it again.

This makes database people unhappy because when the low level kernel 
routines tell the C library that they wrote the block to disk, it might 
not really be on disk, but could be in a buffer somewhere (yes, I'm 
simplifying).  There are system calls and special attributes and some ways 
around this (think fsync() and friends).  But, that's a pain.  And, it 
doesn't solve the whole problem (see later).

Hence, you get the raw devices.  These are special devices created on 
demand that give another interface to some existing block device.  This 
extra interface is outside the whole set of caching etc. that the kernel 
does.  It talks about as directly to the hardware as the kernel can do.  
If you write a block on that interface, when it's done, the drive has told 
it that it's done (it still could be in memory on the drive!  users of 
speedy IDE drives beware, I've lost data due to this).

independent of the actual implementation of the filesystem.

I've never tried to mount a filesystem on a raw device.  Might be possible 
in which case this layer would get hit.

Are these before or after the buffer cache?  I can't for the life of me 
remember.

this was out of order above.  There's not really much here other than a 
pseudo-vtable of file-ops.

Actually, there are a few more pieces to DMA. It is set up by the driver 
and other parts of the kernel (DMA requires locked pages etc., so the VM 
subsystem is involved partially).

> 11) hard drive firmware

11b) hard disk cache.  Modern drives have this.  You can turn it off and 
should if you really want high levels of data integrity.  There was a 
large discussion on the ReiserFS list and the MySQL list some time ago 
(two years?).  You write to the drive, it puts it into cache and tells you 
it's done.  The power goes out.  Some drives do not use rotational energy 
to write the cache to disk (because the cache is too big).  See the actual 
drive specs.  But, don't assume that because the drive told you that it 
wrote the data that the magnetic fields are changed on the platters.

Can't remember off the top of my head, but I remember the syntax being 
similar to that of the loop-back device.

Raw devices have been around on other forms of Unix for a long time.  The 
discussion of raw devices that worked just like those of other Unix 
variants ended with Linus saying "no way, I'm not going to clutter up my 
already full /dev with more cruft!".  Ok, I'm taking liberties with what 
he said, but that is the meat of the argument.  The device space was 
already nearly full (running out of major numbers) and the /dev tree is 
full of all kinds of things that aren't needed most of the time.  devfs 
solves some of the problems.

Raw devices allow specific block devices to have unbuffered access.  They 
do this without cluttering /dev and without overuse of major numbers.

I would not necessarily say that it was speed that the DB people were 
after.  That is a factor.  I think that one of the biggest things they 
wanted was to be able to ensure that blocks were written to disk in a 
specific order. 

With the OS doing one or more layers of caching, elevator algorithms etc. 
and the drives or disk controllers doing the same thing, it is very easy, 
often common, for blocks to be written out of order.  If you are doing a 
very important transaction into a fully ACID compliant DB and the part of 
the transaction that says "DONE!" is written to disk, but the previous two 
blocks aren't when the power goes out, you'll have a corrupt database.

Some kinds of disk controllers (SCSI??, FibreChannel??) can have "write 
barriers".  When the controller hits one of these in the list of commands, 
it makes sure that all writes before the barrier are flushed to disk 
before it does one past the barrier.  So, in my transaction example above, 
you'd put a write barrier just before the "DONE!" block (I think one is 
put after it too so that transactions don't get mixed).  All the blocks 
that were part of that transaction will be flushed to disk before the 
"DONE!" block.

By forcing the order of disk writes, you usually slow down disk access, not 
speed it up.  But, you make sure that you'll have a coherent DB after a 
sudden power failure.

I actually think that raw devices (as done on Linux) are a fairly elegant 
solution to the problem of having direct disk access.  However, I also 
think that a system that makes you need such access is definitely not that 
good.  Most Unix variants fall into that category.

Best,
Kyle

This has to be a problem with your regexp entries in your header and body

2nd question:

I'd like to find out the configuration of the kernel that I
got from Red Hat via up2date. The current kernel I have is:
2.4.9-34, and I was hoping that there would be a ".config" file
in /usr/src/linux-2.4.9-34. The source is there, but there is
no ".config" file.

There is a "configs" directory, which has a number of config
files in it. Is there any way to tell which one matches the
running kernel?

Anyone using a hard disk write-back cache without a UPS and auto-flush on
power failure is begging for pain.  I've felt that pain and it's not
fun.  (Can you say 'fish out the backup tapes', boys and girls?)

I will freely admin to being behind the times on IDE technology, but all
my SCSI drives have write cache OFF even though the system is
UPSed.  Unless I'm running a benchmark to impress my friends. ;-)  Turning
it on gets that extra 20%, but is never appropriate for data that can't be
recreated easily.

My experience has been they're after the higher performance.  
Double-buffering by the OS is just wasting CPU cycles if you're already
using internal database caching as well as possibly caching at the
disk array level.

I think the reason you hear the "specific order" argument is because of
old-timers who learned to manage databases on JBODs (bare disks bereft of
caching/striping/RAID).

Those pesky database people-- always trying to get down into the meat of
the hardware to optimize the database layout for the current data
set.  Unfortunately, most of the databases I deal with have areas of
constantly moving "local busy-ness" which generally correspond to that
day/week/month's data.  Since (unfortunately) most databases have
archiving/data removal put in as an afterthought (if at all), this little
section of high I/O keeps creeping forward in the database over time.

The net result is all that careful tuning is completely useless after a
few weeks or months since the hotspot has moved.

(My solution: loads of battery-backed cache on the hardware (absorbs your
random I/O), and stripe* the fury out of everything (speeds the sequential
I/O).  This gets you 80% of the way there with 10% of the effort and it
works just as well on day 1 as on day 100.)

*I find that striping across hardware RAID-5 groups to be particularly
effective since many RAID-5 controllers are slow on sequential
writes.  Striping over them gives 'em a chance to catch up between I/Os.

Yeah, this is why any database worth anything does opens its files with
the O_SYNC option to ensure that the kernel doesn't return from the
write() until the hardware says the data is safe.  This option
periodically seems to break on linux.  Most UNIX variants have ways of
"translating" this safety feature to be faster and less safe.  Not
recommended.  ;-)

Writing data out of order isn't necessarily a problem if ALL I/O is going
through the buffer cache.  (And anyone mixing buffered and unbuffered I/O
is begging for lots of pain.)  The buffer cache need only ensure that
multiple writes to the *same data* arrive in order, which is usually not a
problem.  Reads to that data will come out of the most-recently-written
buffer so the application need never even know it wasn't on disk.

The power-lost/OS-crashed loss of data is a problem on any write-back
cache and a major reason to avoid them if there is no way to externally
recreate the lost/corrupt data.

Just to beat the point some more, the coherency problem isn't necessarily
related to the ordering-- it's a risk of having data "in transit".

One of the main reasons raw is faster for big databases is they do their
own caching so the buffer does nothing but add a few milliseconds of
searching the buffer to each I/O for no net gain.

Wow.  That sure got long.  ;-)

I have a ThinkPad 360PE. There is a feature that you have to set in
the lilo, or in the grub: floppy=thinkpad
This tells linux that you're running on a thinkpad, which as an
inverted floppy sense line. IBM decided to save some realestate on
this series, which requires the software to adjust.

I got RedHat 5.2 running by putting my drive into someone elses box,
and installing it all there, and then rebooting. I got RH7.2 installed
by connecting the laptop to another system which had a drive
containing _all_ the files from the two installation disks, and using
boot floppies made from disk1 to do an ftp install.

Maybe this is OT from what you are asking for, but I thot maybe there
might be some clues herein. As I read your question again, maybe
you're telling us that there is no floppy on your thinkpad...

It turned out that the tool I needed was a vim sequence, which I've
put into the .vimrc for handy use.

I tried the 'gqip' sequences (gq??), and it didn't do anything. Is
that a feature that is only available in the GUI? I'm doing email on a
system that doesn't support GUI (another long story), so I run 6
console sessions.....

Subject: [PLUG] Saving Gnome Session
Message-ID: <3DA59902.E29271BE@computer-arts.net>

When I check the "save session" box, when logging out of Gnome,
it appears to create the file $HOME/.gnome/session. In this file,
the apps that I'm running are saved, but no info about their
"geometry" appears to be saved.

It appears that I can edit the session file by hand, for example:
  6,Program=xterm
  6,CloneCommand=xterm +sb -geometry 80x24+6+356 
  6,RestartCommand=xterm +sb -geometry 80x24+6+356 
seems to do what I want, when I log off and on again.

However, Gnome periodically seems to want to change this file
when I DON'T do the "save session" thing. Also, of course, it would
be nice to have Gnome save the geometry info if possible.

Can anyone point me to documentation that addresses this?
When I open up "help" in Gnome is comes up with something that either
doesn't work very well, or that I don't understand :-)  It appears
that if If I knew exactly where I wanted to look, I might find
something, but I can't figure out any way to search through it.

The pages I design use tables for layout, so I usually just place text
above or below (as appropriate) the image in the same cell.  Use a <BR>
tag to force them onto different lines.

Some distro's put the .config of the running kernel in the /boot

You should have /boot/config-2.4.9-34
This is the .config file for that kernel.

/usr/src/linux-2.4/configs/ contains configs for all kernel packages.
If you know which one you installed (i.e. smp or not, i686, athlon, etc),
you can find your config.
If you want to rebuild, this is a good starting point, too.

Yep. Current versions of Debian and SuSE should run on it.

Nothing that requires huge amounts of speed :-)

Seriously, you could use it to host a variety of network services: 
web, light-duty RDBMS, dhcp, ntp, ldap. Unless your app is seriously 
CPU-intensive, it'll do just fine.

Yep, I had odd issues with my SS5-110 and Debian Woody (3.0) which I was
never able to figure out.  Debian seems to be one of the best distros out
there for Sparc, or at least has the best support.  RedHat dropped sparc
support after 6.2 (however it worked great).  And of course since RH dropped
it Mandrake follows suit.  SuSe used to have a sparc release but it would
appear they do no longer.  

Your best starting point for Linux-Sparc resources should be:
www.ultralinux.org
They have a listing of supported distros and FAQs.
Have fun!

  Only 1 person has commented that she would like to see images on my Web

You could give Gentoo a shot too.
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/gentoo-sparc-install.html

It looks like sparc32 support is somewhat limited, so one of the other 
distros might be better for a SS10. I've poked around on an Ultra 5 with 
Gentoo a bit.

The BSDs are an option also, I had NetBSD running on a Sparc Voyager 
(the luggable sun4m) in the not too distant past.

Ok. This was the last posting of a thread from last spring when I first
brought up a problem I was having with my machine resetting itself on
occasion. There was much to think about in all the good ideas that came
from this list. There were also a lot of other things that came up to
get in the way of pursuing any of them. But just recently, the problem
resurfaced, so I went back and read all the old posts and have come up
with what I think is a working solution.

To review: I have two floor mats under my desk chair, a metal table with
the mouse on it, and a metal frame/laminate topped table with the
keyboard and monitor on it. The computer itself sits on a wooden box
under the metal table. If the chair bumps the metal table, the machine
resets. (Last spring, other static events were also causing the reset.)

In looking over the various recommendations, the point about the static
mats being a capacitor made good sense. Also, that just bolting a wire
to them wasn't going to do much to drain that charge, since they are
plastic, after all. It occurred to me that I could approximate a fancy
discharge mat if I could incorporate a metallic grid into the mat
system. I now have a piece of chicken wire sandwiched between the two
plastic mats, and a length of small chain draped around the chair
pedestal so that it drags on the mat. I crimped a piece of awg 20
stranded wire to one of the cut ends of the chicken wire and ran that
over to a leg of the metal table. I ran another piece of the same wire
from that point on the table leg to the screw of an outlet cover. Spade
lugs are crimped to the two wires where they are held under a screw on
the table leg. I tried to use a spade lug for the wire under the cover
plate screw, but the screw is too short, so I just went with wrapping
the stranded wire around the screw before tightening it.

I have tested the setup by rolling the chair across the mat and letting
it hit the table. It seems to work! The system did not reset. While
that's probably not a great test, it is a test using the original
parameters. Time will tell if I've really solved the problem.

So, thanks to all who offered advice back in May. If this turns out not
to work, I'll let you know.

With help from Arjan van de Ven at Redhat, the solution to this problem
was the following:

"can you try putting

apm=idle_threshold=100

on the kernel commandline ? (eg type "e" in grub and then edit the line
with vmlinuz on it to add that)"

It fixed the problem.  Apparently I was the fifth person he helped with
this fix so it is not entirely uncommon.  The line has something to do
with power management for laptops which seems to break certain PCs.....

I'm in the process of working with a SoundBlaster Live on Red
Hat 7.2. I don't know exactly what the differences are between
Mandrake and RedHat, but I've currently got everything working
except Midi I/O. I'm using the emu10k1 driver. I'm just in the
process of installing the newest version of the driver from
Source Forge, which I *hope* will enable Midi. I would be more
than happy to compare notes.

Yes.  I have a copy of Redhat 6.2 that will work.  There are other 
distributions that support Sparc as well.

The same thing that you would do with any slow machine.  Make it into a 
firewall or web server.

Right. I'm having pretty good success using configs/kernel-2.4.9-i386.config
Is there a way to tell which config the running kernel was built with?

I just set up Debian Woody on a sparc 10. It went pretty smoothly, other
than the debian installer not realizing that the few tasksel selections
I made would fill the (420MB) disk. 

I did have a problem with the debian sparc netboot image and an IPX (sun4c
class), where the kernel just seemed to hang on loading itself. I didn't
have a chance to diagnose it any further than that.

I don't wanna imagine how long it would take a sparc10 to bootstrap a
gentoo install.

Yes, I installed NetBSD 1.6 on the IPX I mentioned above. Once I got the
darn thing to netboot properly (needed tftp, bootpd, bootparams, and
nfsd all working), it was a pretty straightforward install.

3rd question:

In my /boot directory, there are files called module-info-(kernel name)
for the kernels that came from red hat. Can anyone point me to info
on how these are supposed to be generated, and what might use them?

I'm not providing them for kernels I build. So far that doesn't
*appear* to be a problem. But maybe one of the ones already there
is getting used by default? (like the one simply called "module-info"
which is a link to module-info-2.4.9-34)

I think you really want to add a resistor in series to prevent possible shock.

chicken wire -> desk -> 10M ohm/.25W restr -> outlet cover

(That's 10 Meg ohm)

I'm using Mandrake 9.0 with a Sound Blaster Live and it seems to be 
working.

I have enlightenment as my window manager, no KDE or Gnome installed. 
I'm listening to mp3s with xmms right now, and gaim sounds are working too.

I didn't do anything special to get it to work. It indicated that it 
found it during the install, and away it went.

There is also a RedHat-like distro that reportedly works, called

Two items to be aware of:

1) Make sure you have enough disk in the Sparc. The one I have has
two 400 MB drives -- not quite enough to load X using the latest
version of Debian. This can put a crimp on many uses for it.

2) SS10's do not have a built in CDROM. You'll have to either
scrounge a SCI external CDROM drive (I built one using an old 411
case & a 4x SCSI Plextor drive -- works fine) or set up an NFS
server & use the CDROM drive on that.

On the plus side, I find that my SS10 is clearly zippier than the
486 I've been using as a testbed, & from watching the listings on
ebay, I can attest that you can find lots of spare parts to beef
it up, if you so desire.

Have you tried hooking up a Midi keyboard?  That's the only thing
that I haven't been able to get working so far, and I'm pretty
much stumped at the moment.

Thanks! I forgot that step. I should have one of those in a junk drawer,

Subject: [PLUG] KDE3 screwed by the commercial QT 3.0.5
In-Reply-To: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0210101508530.1896-100000@joan.burling.com>
Message-ID: <200210102142.g9ALgYV15508@gate.daniloff.com>

Hello Linux folkz,

After installing commercial version of
Qt 3.0.5 all KDE3 environment gets f***ed up.
I can't understand what could go wrong.
Should I have deinstalled free version of QT
whitch came as a default installation alongside
KDE3 or something else? 
Any KDE application starts and exits with 
error messages. Some applications won't even start.
Could somebody please give me an idea what
needs to be done to fix this disaster.

Thank you in advance for any help or sources of
information.

Alex

UltraWide, or SCSI II. Since it's a generation back, they're
very inexpensive right now. (I just picked up a sparc-compatible
external SCSI cable at FreeGeek for $2.50 -- about a third of
the mail order price of $9-10, which is still a lot less than
what this stuff cost 5 to 7 years ago.)

If you poke around the Sun web site, you can find the field engineer
manual for the SS10. Lots of useful tips there. (And I wonder how
long before some PHB at Sun decides to remove them in order ``to
save money"?)

Well, I'd try, but I don't have a keyboard, let alone a midi keyboard.

OK, having fun here on a 'pounder' machine. (Not connected to network, no

266MHz, 1.2GB HD, installing Caldera 2.2

Anyways, the symptom I'm getting is that the installation won't "stick."
If I shut down and reboot again the "LILO" only gets to "LI" and hangs.

Any hints?

	Images could really be valuable - depends on the focus of the 
site. I'd counsel you not to dismiss the idea, without careful 
consideration of what you want to do with the site and WHO your 
audience is.
	While YOU might not see the need for images, your potential 
audience might. This woman's feedback could be a bellwether for you.

What do you have 'textwidth' and 'formatoptions' set to? For more clues,
from within ViM, try `:help gq'. The online help for ViM is excellent.

[SNIP!]

It came from me with Kmail 1.4.3 from KDE 3.0.3.  While KMail sometimes 
doesn't handle MIME attachements from Eudora (older versions) sometimes, I 
haven't had the reverse be true.  I just upgraded to KDE 3.0.3.  Perhaps 
I've got a setting out of whack??

Subject: [PLUG] OT: suspicious returned e-mails
Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.0.20021010172235.00aa9008@www.dylanreinhardt.com>

Hi all,

The last week or so, I've gotten a handful of returned e-mails.

What's suspicious is that I'm certain I never sent them.  The accounts I 
supposedly sent from are aliases that are only used for inbound mail from 
web sites I host.

So something is obviously amiss.  I'm not sure what, exactly, one might 
stand to gain from spoofing real addresses to send mail to non-existent 
recipients, but I thought some of the more grizzled netizens among us might 
have an idea what kind of exploit is being attempted.

A copy of one such returned mail is copied below.  In this mail, 
ev at dylanreinhardt.com is an inbound alias.  My mail server 
is  www.digitaldrywall.com (yes, www... it's a RaQ).  A MIME header says it 
had a midi file attached, but the file type was exe.  I didn't try to make 
use of the large amount of gibberish data in the body of the message, so 
it's tough to say what the file might have been.

Should I be reporting abuse to postmaster at ooops.org, or is that what 
they're trying to trick me into doing?  Could this be some ultra-clever 
ruse to confirm webmaster addresses for a spam list?

TIA for any thoughts y'all might have... I don't imagine there's anything 
to be done... mostly I'm curious to keep up with what those crazy kids are 
doing these days.

Dylan

It's the nasty Klez worm at work. See...

http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.h at mm.html

...where you'll note...

Email:
This worm searches the Windows address book, the ICQ database, and local files
for email addresses. The worm sends an email message to these addresses with
itself as an attachment. The worm contains its own SMTP engine and attempts to
guess at available SMTP servers. For example, if the worm encounters the
address user at abc123.com it will attempt to send email via the server
smtp.abc123.com.

The subject line, message bodies, and attachment file names are random. The
From address is randomly-chosen from email addresses that the worm finds on the
infected computer.

Usually this is because the /boot area is not in the first 1024 cylinders
of the disk.  Try creating a 50MB /boot partition as the first primary
partition on the disk and reinstalling.

Sandy is absolutely correct about this.

I actually get klez messages from my own email addresses. Including 
addresses I haven't used in years. Makes me wonder who out there has my 
email address in their cache from 10 years ago.

  It's the power of the Web. I still get e-mail asking if I still have the
Libretto for sale (after 3 years?) and, today, a call from someone following
up on an Aplix question I posted somewhere over 5 years ago.

Go figure,

Ah, Klez...  yeah, my Windoze IT buddies have been making quite a fuss 
about that one.  I didn't realize it spoofed mail *from* addresses in the 
infected PC's address book.  Nasty.

I feel so out of touch.  Ever since I stopped using Outlook, it's been 
difficult to keep up with what's happening in the world of e-mail 
viruses.  :-)

Thanks for the info.

Then stop compiling it repeatedly.

See PPerl, mod_perl, FastCGI, SOAP, POE, etc etc.

Many solutions to persist a Perl compilation or a Perl process.

Subject: [PLUG] PC Reboots As Kernel Loads
Message-ID: <20021011072528.GB418@nellump.net>

Strange. I recently replaced the aging P166 motherboard in my Linux
box with a second-hand (known good) MicronPC i810-based 700 MHz
Celeron mobo. Everything looks alright until the kernel attempts
to load, at which point the box spontaneously reboots.

I can just barely make out where the kernel message spew is when
it barfs: it appears to be just *after* the "calculating delay
loop" line, which judging by the dmesg output of my other systems
is when the kernel decides what it has to work with in the way of
RAM.

Is it possible for "bad" RAM to make the kernel barf? This RAM came
off of the P166 board (yes, it's compatible with the Celeron --
standard PC133 DIMMs), and was working just fine. Also, I had no
difficulties booting with a Win98 boot floppy (sigh).

The next step I had in mind was to run some sort of memory test
software. Any better ideas?

Subject: [PLUG] Null Modem
Message-ID: <1034322097.6526.10.camel@moochercrew.org>

I'm trying to set up a serial link between my SparcStation 1 and my
linux box, using 2 radioshack serial cables, a Null Modem, and a 25->9
pin converter (I know, that's a LOT of cable to have a loose link in. 
Unfortunately, I don't know how to
A) find out which serial port I'm plugged into
B) Use Minicom to connect through a null modem (It always says I'm
offline, nomatter WHICH serial port I'm using
C) I don't even know if the sparcstation truely works, A friend gave it
too me, and said that it probably won't boot properly, 

I don't have a harddrive or a floppy drive in there, all I really want
is some diagnostics messages through my serial cable, since I don't have
a Monitor or a Keyboard for a sun.

Can anybody help me here?  Or am I dead in the watter?

Are you still using the same power supply that came with the 166 MHz
board?  If so, I would suggest trying a newer, beefier supply.  It
has been my experience that right around the bogomips calculation is
where the kernel really starts working hard.  An embedded PowerPC
board that I've been working on will often reset at that spot if
the power supply isn't up to snuff.

The memory test is also a good idea.  You can download a free one
at memtest86.com.

This'll wipe the information off your drive, but if you have any sort of
boot disk with fdisk on it, you can try fdisk /mbr
That resets the master boot record.  Then I would suggest what Steve
suggests and create a nice new partition.  Then reboot and all should be
good...

Good luck!

reset the master boot record on the hd.
That's what I'd try first.

Thanks - but how do I do that? (Is there a pushbutton?)

Be aware that you may be trying out too many new unknowns all at once.
You could use a Linux box with two serial ports connected with a cable.
Have a minicom talking to each port. Then with two windows on the 
screen, type into one minicom, and see it received in the other minicom
in the other window.  Then you will know if you have your cables working
properly.
Then attach it to the Sun box.
You will also need the pinout of the Sun serial port.
Google is your friend here.

You only need regular modem cable... nothing special about it... and on
Minicom it will always say you are not connected even though you are
connected to a Sun... Make sure you are connected to the "Serial A"
port on a Sun.  Here is a config file for Minicom... save it as
"/etc/minirc.sun" and type "minicom -s sun" .... you are good to go!!!

Some people use this list via email, and some use it as a 
newsgroup. It appears that, if you use it via mail, the string
[PLUG] is prepended to the message. But [PLUG] is not prepended
if you post via NNTP.

If I'm understanding correctly, this results in two separate
"threads" (at least as parsed by my news reader) when people
respond both via mail and NNTP.

I post with NNTP, but in this post I have prepended the string
[PLUG] by hand. So, will this result in only a single "thread?"

That depends upon how you (or your newsreader/MUA in particular) define
"thread". Mine (slrn and mutt) thread by References: rather than by Subject:
- which is a far better way to correlate, especially when someone alters the
subject.

I've seen a similar symptom when the kernel catches an NMI during the boot.
Try disabling them on the command line and see if the system boots.

Two questions.  Firs, how do I find what version of the flash player I
have installed?  I'm using Mozilla on my system and a couple of flash
games don't work on my linux machine.

Second, if I have an older version, how do I upgrade.  I downloaded the
new version, but the instructions are for Netscape.

I want to tag a question on to this. One nice feature of Mozilla is the 
ability to block images (ads) on a by server basis. This doesn't help 
with flash ads, which I am seeing more and more of.

Is there a way to block flash content on a by server basis? Or can I 
disable flash from automatically running (unless I OK it)?

Similarly as you would with netscape. Just substitute Mozilla like
replacements.

/usr/lib/mozilla-1.0.1/plugins

copy your new flash files into that directory. Your Mozilla version may
vary.

I looked into this a few days ago and found several solutions. One
approach is to use "jFlashmanager" [3] a java program that automates
turning flash on and off. You could also use a web proxy like privoxy [1],
or a bookmarklet that suppresses flash and iframes [2]. The approach I'm
taking is to block flash ad servers in my /etc/hosts file [4].


1. http://www.privoxy.org/

"Privoxy is a web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for
 protecting privacy, filtering web page content, managing cookies,
 controlling access, and removing ads, banners, pop-ups and other
 obnoxious Internet junk... Privoxy has application for both
 stand-alone systems and multi-user networks."

 License: GNU GPL

2. http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/zap.html

 "Removes java, flash, background music, and iframes from a page. (The
 HTML tags removed are object, embed, applet, and iframe.)"

 License: Free

3. http://www.jtedley.com./jtflashmanager/index.php

 "jTFlashManager gives you the capability to turn Flash on and off for all
of your browsers. "

License: Free

4. http://slack.net/~ads/

"You can put the list of servers above in your proxy machine's
/etc/hosts file and conveniently block ads for all your users. This
will also save you lots of bandwidth and help protect your users'
privacy. "

You probably have the dynamic library, but not the headers appropriate to
compile against the library.  This is one of the lame things about trying
to compile software on a binary distribution.

Perhaps you should check to see if your package repository contains a
libao development package, as opposed to a straight libao binary library
package.

Install the "devel" package that goes with the libao package. I don't 
have a RH8 system handy, so I can't give you the exact name.

I concur with Jeme. You have the library, but not the headers. The 
headers and source come in the devel rpms for that package.

It means you don't have 11Mb free on your root partition.
Type,
	$ df -h
to see what you have where.

Re: /dev/shm on RH 7.3, the relevant part of `mount` says
  none on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)

probably similar to yours.  (Was surprised when the installer asked a bigger 
swapfile, I already had allocated a generous swap partition).  But I don't 
think this is your problem.  Open Office wants a permanent place to install
itself.

Type,
	$ rpm -qilp OpenOffice-suite-1.0-3.i386.rpm
you'll see where it wants to plant itself.  If it's /opt, then create a symlink
	$ln -s /home/on/the/range /opt

That means it's not finding at least 11 megs available on the root ( / ) 
file system. What is the output of 'df'?

That's the device for the swap file. It's not unusual to have a swap 
partition that's 440 megs. I have a 1 gig swap partition. For no other 
reason than I have a 40 gig drive, and I'd rather not run out of memory. 
Even virtual memory.

This seems wrong to me. When I see devel in package names, I think of
me doing development work. I don't think of me just installing
software and using it.

I'd expect the devel package to have source for all the parts of the
program. If the headers of the binary libraries are necessary for
installing applications that must be compiled on your system, then why
can't the headers for that binary library be included in the
'non-devel' package; assuming that the headers are not the full
source.

I'm not sure I want full source of every tool on those systems where I
need to compile programs. Since all of my systems are unique (speaking
cpu's here), in order to have optimal compiles, I'd have to have all the
source on all of them; and there isn't necessarily enough disk space on
all the systems for that. As a developer, I'd want full source of only
those tools I'd be developing, or needing to view in order to complete
said development -- and then only on my development system. As a user,
I don't seen a need for any full source -- except those sources that I
choose for educational reasons.

When "devel" is in a package name (nearly always a library package), it
just means the headers are there for compiling software that links against
the library.

It _IS_ super dumb.  I totally agree.  There is absolutely no reason to
equate 
./configure && make test install 
with software development.  I think that probably scares people that it
shouldn't.

I'd like an answer to that, too, honestly.

Now, the headers are only required when you are going to compile software
and there is a method of moving binaries between machines and putting them
in the proper locations so that they work well enough to be called
"installed", so technically the headers aren't required to install
applications for which you have precompiled binaries.  But so what?

The "devel" packages are usually just binary packages with headers, not
source packages.  Yeah, it's totally dumb.  But so is packaged binaries
for fast computers.

Well, there _IS_ such a thing as cross-compiling.  You can build for other
architectures than the one running on your system.

Right, so most package management systems have adopted the following
naming scheme:
(these may be rpm, deb, tgz, whatever)

foo:  The binary executables, libraries, stock
configuration, and (at least minimal) documentation files to use the
application.

foo-devel:  The same as the above, often compiled with debugging symbols
in the binaries, plus the header files for compiling new binaries against
any shared libraries in the package and (hopefully) some extra
documentation.

foo-src:  The full source for the package and documentation, usually
modified with special patches and configuration defaults to make it
compliant with the schemes and ideals of the package maintainer and the
distribution maintainer (rather than the software's official maintainer).

Dig?

To list the partition table on a drive

fdisk -l  -u /dev/harddrive 

I only know of a utility for defragmenting a ext2 filesystem. since Linux has
support and patches for so many file systems you will have to look for
yourself.

You will need to specify what you mean by "safe and easy way". Are you talking
saving the data on the partition and resizing them, a wipe and repartition, or
are you looking for information on something like LVM?

Thank you
Russell

I don't know about safe and easy, but parted (partition editor) does
this job. It has been described as not for the faint of heart, but if
you read the manual and CAREFULLY plan your work, you should be able to
do it. I did it a few weeks ago after having read only the on-line
manual.

I need to resize the partitions safely not to destroy them making the whole 
system collapsed and/or some files/folders disappeared afterwards.  Also I 
need to add new partitions and removed unwanted partitions.

Thanks

What filesystem are you using? If ext2, defragmenting is not likely to
improve disk performance. This is because ext2 (unlike FAT and NTFS)
guarantees allocation of the closest free block even when contiguous
blocks are unavailable. While the files are still fragmented, the
discontiguous blocks are packed so closely that the effect of
fragmentation is minimal.

"Fragmentation on a typical ext2 disk is usually between zero and three
percent no matter how much file system activity occurs."

http://www.biznix.org/whylinux/windows/fragment.html

"The ext2 filesystem attempts to keep fragmentation at a minimum, by
keeping all blocks in a file close together, even if they can't be stored
in consecutive sectors. Ext2 effectively always allocates the free block
that is nearest to other blocks in a file. For ext2, it is therefore
seldom necessary to worry about fragmentation."

Ah, but you ARE doing development work. You are compiling software from 
source, which is development. You may not be editing the code, but you 
are compiling it. You'll only need those headers if you compile your 
programs. You'll never need them if you always install from a binary RPM.

You are only "installing software and using it" when you never 
"./configure", and always install the binary RPM. Of course, this is 
easier in theory than practice.

They're not required, unless you choose to install and "./configure" 
with the source.

Freesco runs quite well but takes a bit to set up and configure.  But the
great thing about it is it runs off of a floppy.  You edit and configure
the disk image then write it and boot to the floppy.  Have it running on a
P133 just fine, all the moving parts are the floppy and PS fan; CPU
doesn't even have a fan...but the box is quite large.

I think I have a pre-configured disk image laying around...

It's not editing the code, but it IS part of the developement process, 
and a vast step beyond what most computer users want to do with their 
computer.

*MOST* users simply want a computer that runs the programs they want, 
without any build environment at all. They just want it to work.

In that case, having the headers on the system would be wasted space, 
and could open up additional security holes.

For you and I, it's not a big deal to open the source tar ball, 
configure, test and install source. For Joe sixpack, he doesn't even 
want to know the capability is there. He doesn't care. He wants his 
computer to run, and that's it.

For the vast majority of computer users, there's no need for source, 
compilers, headers or any of this other stuff you and I like so much.

And there's nothing wrong with that. If they don't want to learn how to 
compile a program from source, they don't have to. The binary 
distributions do that for them, and that's what they get paid to do. 
That's also what makes America great. We each have our own choices to 
make.

In your opinion. For you, it probably is dumb. For the guy down the 
street that just wants to pick up his mail, surf, and maybe chat, a 
full-on developement system that can compile anything is dumb. He 
doesn't need it, and doesn't want it.

Other folks have other needs, and what fits your style might be totally inappropriate for others.

For about $50 or less, you can get a Netgear RT311 router off Ebay.

I found mine to be every bit as secure as a linux firewall (more in some 
cases) and faster.

It has a web based configuration, only available on the LAN connection. 
It supports port forwarding.

Subject: [PLUG] PCMCIA Driver for Debian Install
Message-ID: <3DAB05D0.9B9D45E7@attbi.com>

I'm using the network technique to install Debian on my Thinkpad 390X.
I've gotten to the "Select net modules" part where I'm supposed to
select a driver from a long list. I have a 3Com Model 3CXE589ET, 10 Mbps
PCMCIA card. I find a number of 3c--- drivers listed, but none of them
are specifically the one I have. Does anyone know if the model I have
works with one of these? I looked up the 589 on 3Com's site, but didn't
learn anything useful.

3c501		'EtherLink' support
3c503		'EtherLink II' support
3c505		'EtherLink Plus' support
3c507		'EtherLink 16' support
3c509		'EtherLink III' support
3c515		ISA Fast EtherLink
3c523		'EtherLinkMC' support
3c529-scyld	(No description available)
3c59x		'Vortex/Boomeran [that's all that's on the screen]

Thanks for any help.

My general method for dealing with this sort of issue is to pop 
/proc/pci into less and try to figure out what the kernel sees.

Of course, it'd also be helpful to know what kernel you're installing 
(does Debian still install 2.2 by default/). In the 2.4 series, 
there's a module specifically for 3Com 3c589 PCMCIA support 
(3c589_cs.o).

Not sure how I'd do that before the installation finishes.

I'm working with the floppies from:

http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/3.0.23-2002-05-21/images-1.44/

It looks like it's 2.2.20, although some files are labeled 2.4.16...

It would be nice if there were an easy way to set up effective firewall
rules using a command line or GUI.  Unfortunately there isn't.

The user interface isn't the problem.  Getting firewall rules correct is
difficult and error prone.  One must be intimate with how the firewall
processes rules, and understand in detail how IP protocols work.

Then the fun begins.  The firewall and the set of rules need to be
tested.  This step is difficult and requires experience using IP tool
sets.

My experience is the most effective firewall rule that requires the
lease amout of experience to setting up NAT.  This is what most off the
shelf consumer firewalls use by default.

IIRC, the Debian install kernel includes /proc filesystem support. You 
should be able to switch to the second virtual console any time after 
the "colorful" portion of the installer starts up, and check from there.

The default Debian 3.0 install floppies do use 2.2.20, but there's 
another (fairly well-supported) set of disk images available from the 
same mirrors. Look for the 'bf-2.4' directory under 'images-1.44', and 
you should see 'rescue.bin', 'install.bin', and 'drivers-[1-4].bin'. I 
have a ThinkPad 560 which I recently finished a Debian/bf-2.4 install 
on, and the driver for the 3c589-based Farallon network card I have was 
in the standard driver collection.

Plus, if you use the bf-2.4 images, you have the option of using an Ext3 
root partition, which (for me, at least) is a major win. I've spent too 
much time watching fsck slowly fill the screen with a row of equals 
signs, only to stumble over some mess left by an inopportune power 
failure. I also like to live on the "bleeding edge," and the 'unstable' 
tree of Debian has lots of nice 2.4-kernel-specific goodies.

The only issue I've found with a 2.4-based Debian installation is that 
fewer module packages are available as binaries: for example, the 
'thinkpad' modules which tpctl uses to replication most of the Windows 
ThinkPad setup utility's functionality is only available as a source 
package, which is kind of a drag on my 560 (a 133Mhz machine with 40MB 
of RAM).

Good luck,

I've only done a couple Debian installations, and both have been over
serial consoles, so my memory may not count for much -- but I
*thought* you could get to a shell prompt during the installation. Or
maybe that's only an option after installation and before reboot.

The Red Hat installer gives you a shell on the second virtual terminal 
(Alt + F2), and it wouldn't surprise me at all to see that Debian 
did a similar thing.

I second that.  Been using Freesco for about a year now.  You can
administer it via a webpage from your LAN, so you don't even have to
have a monitor or keyboard hooked up to it after it's booted.  Very
configurable.

Freesco runs quite well but takes a bit to set up and configure.  But
the great thing about it is it runs off of a floppy.  You edit and
configure the disk image then write it and boot to the floppy.  Have it
running on a P133 just fine, all the moving parts are the floppy and PS
fan; CPU doesn't even have a fan...but the box is quite large.

I think I have a pre-configured disk image laying around...

IIRC, the module for your specific card will be detected when PCMCIA is
first configured.  It was a couple of months ago, but it seems like the
install procedure missed the "Configure PCMCIA" step, you just need to
select it from the long list.

I'm pretty sure you don't need to load any "drivers"; in other words,
you can skip the step that loads the modules.  You will know if the
PCMCIA stuff loaded properly if the step after you do the "Configure
PCMCIA" is "Configure Network".  If the "Configure Network" doesn't show
up next, you need to go back to the "Configure PCMCIA" and try again.

I was actually blown away by how simple the installation was for a
laptop.

Good Luck

Now I'd like to install PostgreSQL, and my friend has never used it,

Can someone give me, in a nutshell, what I need to do to change all

Okay, so that was a poor subject, but here's what I'm looking for.

I have Windows 2000 on a 40GB drive in my _other_ computer....
But as long as it's been installed, I've never used but 4GB,
so that drive is going largely to waste.  I have a 9GB drive
I'd like to "move" my install to...  The disks are different
sizes, so whatever copy occurs can't copy the partition table,
'cause it will be erroneous on the 9GB disk.

The 40GB W2K partition is NTFS.  Any suggestions for easy-to-do,
bullet-proof, etc. copy?  I don't want to reinstall Windows,
recreate all the profiles, reinstall all the application software,
etc.

Thanks,

Could you use fdisk to resize the Windows partition? Then, "move" the
now 9GB partition to the 9GB drive?

This probably won't work with NTFS.

The best luck I've had with this issue is Norton Ghost.  They make a PE
version that came with the basic "SystemWorks 2000".  The PE version
won't do the network dumps, but can move a partition of one size to a
partition of another size on the local machine.  The drawback is that it
boots to DOS, so SCSI transfers are painfully slow (no drivers).

Subject: [PLUG] ftp and ssh
Message-ID: <000801c273d3$749216a0$0300a8c0@druidsgiant>

Hey all, I'm hoping someone has had better luck with this than I have. I
installed Redhat 8.0, then downloaded and installed the Pure-FTPd rpm. I
set this up as per the readme and had everything working satisfactorily,
other than the fact that it was plain ftp. (NOTE: I have been unable to
access the pure-ftpd site today, www.pureftpd.org, but google has the
site cached) SO, I tried to setup FTP with SSH. I followed the steps in
the faq, with a few differences. I've copied the pertinent faq section
below. I attempted to create a user of type 2, (encrypted access only)
but had to slightly modify the commands he used.

He used:
	useradd -u ftpuser -g ftpgroup -d /dev/null -s /usr/bin/false
customer2

I used
	useradd -u 600 -g 501 -d /dev/null -s /bin/false drewftp
He used:
	pure-pw useradd customer2 -m -d /home/customer2 -u ftpuser -r
127.0.0.1/32
I used:
	pure-pw useradd drewftp -m -d /home/customer2 -u 600 -g 501 -r
127.0.0.1/32

SO, now when I try to connect to the server over ssh using SecureFX
(http://www.vandyke.com/download/securefx/index.html) I get password
authentication failed while trying to use the drewftp user. However, I
can connect just fine using a regular user that I setup over regular ftp
(no ssh). Here's what SecureFX said:

* FTP over SSH.

-> How to run Pure-FTPd over SSH? I want to encrypt all connection data
(including passwords) .

FTP-over-SSH is a nice alternative over FTP-over-SSL (impossible to
securely
firewall) and SFTP (which is slower, but only uses one port) .

Customers using Windows can use FTP-over-SSH with the excellent Van
Dyke's
SecureFX client (http://www.vandyke.com) . It doesn't require any
special
knowledge : just tell your customer to check "FTP-over-SSH2" in the
"Protocol" listbox when creating an account for your FTP server.

On the server side, here's how to manage FTP-over-SSH accounts :

1) Add /usr/bin/false to your /etc/shells file (on some systems, it's
/bin/false) .

2) To create a FTP-over-SSH account, create a system account with
/dev/null
as a home directory, and /usr/bin/false as a shell. You don't need a
dedicated uid : the same uid can be reused for every FTP-over-SSH
account.

3) Create a virtual user account for that user (either with PureDB, SQL
or
LDAP) . Give that virtual user a real home directory, and only allow
connections coming from 127.0.0.1 (all FTP-over-SSH sessions will come
from
localhost, due to SSH tunneling) .

People with no home directory (/dev/null) and no valid shell
(/usr/bin/false) won't be able to get a shell nor to run any command on
your
server. But they will be granted FTP-over-SSH sessions.

Here are examples (Linux/OpenBSD commands, translate them if necessary)
.

1) Creating a regular FTP account :

pure-pw useradd customer1 -m -d /home/customer1 -u ftpuser

2) Creating a FTP-over-SSH account (non-encrypted sessions are denied) :

useradd -u ftpuser -g ftpgroup -d /dev/null -s /usr/bin/false customer2
pure-pw useradd customer2 -m -d /home/customer2 -u ftpuser -r
127.0.0.1/32

3) Creating an account who can use regular (unencrypted) FTP from the
internal network (192.168.1.x), but who must use FTP-over-SSH when
coming
from an external network (internet) :

useradd -u ftpuser -g ftpgroup -d /dev/null -s /usr/bin/false customer3
pure-pw useradd customer3 -m -d /home/customer3 -u ftpuser \
        -r 127.0.0.1/32,192.168.1.0/24



* Virtual users : /etc/pureftpd.pdb .

-> I made changes to /etc/pureftpd.passwd but the server doesn't
understand
them : I can't access any account I just created.

The server never reads /etc/pureftpd.passwd directly. Instead, it reads
/etc/pureftpd.pdb (or whatever file name you gave after -lpuredb:....) .

This file is a copy of /etc/pureftpd.passwd, but in a binary format,
optimized for fast lookups.

After having made a manual change to /etc/pureftpd.passwd, you must
rebuild
/etc/pureftpd.pdb with the following commands :

pure-pw mkdb

If you add/delete/modify user accounts with pure-pw
useradd/usermod/userdel/
passwd, don't forget the '-m' option to automatically rebuild
/etc/pureftpd.pdb and not only update /etc/pureftpd.passwd .

Oops, I gave a symlink.  /etc/X11/fs/config is the real file, and the other
is symlinked at fs: 

$ls /usr/X11R6/lib/X11 -l |grep fs
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           22 May 19 11:24 fs -> ../../../../etc/X11/fs

At any rate, you can usually tell where any file came from with: 
'rpm -q --whatprovides /my/file' but it's funny that 
'rpm -q --whatprovides /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fs/config' reports XFree86-xfs-4.2.0-8
but rpm -ql XFree86-xfs-4.2.0-8 reports /etc/X11/fs/config

They're hardlinks.  Do an ls -li on each file and you'll see they have the
same inode number.

Dear @openoffice.org:

What is the best way to go about job postings for your organization. I have looked over your lists and don't want to do anything that would offend a member by my lack of understanding of your protocol.

My assumption is that I must join the appropriate list and that appears to be announce at openoffice.org but I would like to do so more surgically than anything remotely associated with a Spam message and would like your input before I do anything.

I represent a bleeding edge client within the XML community and there are several outstanding opportunities that I would like to expose to the proper members.

Any thoughts and suggestions you may give me on how to do this appropriately within the realm of your guidelines  would be appreciated.

One problem may be that the home directory is customer2, but the user is
drewftp, I think SSH needs the home directory to match the user name.

I've only installed Postgres on FreeBSD, but here's my $.02

The default install doesn't allow remote connections. Most of the connection and authentication settings are in data/pg_hba.conf or data/postgresql.conf relative to the postgresql user's home directory. FreeBSD sets up the user pgsql by default under the directory /usr/local/pgsql. My guess is that RedHat isn't far off. The docs at http://www.postgresql.org/idocs/index.php?installation.html may help.

Good luck.

Should I have put free beer in the subject?  ;-^)

Red Hat's new bright red motor home is crossing the country and will be
stopping here in Portland for the weekend of Nov. 15 - 18. So far we've
planned for them to join us for a Linux Clinic on Saturday the 16th. 
http://www.idg.net/ic_956369_1794_9-10000.html

We want to have an evening for grownups too though. The goal is to find
a place where we can have a round table discussion mixed liberally with
beverages for Saturday night on the 16th.

So the question, who knows of a HUGE pub that can devote the space to a
group that wants to eat and drink and round table? We'd need to be able
to do all three. As far as numbers think 200 or so.

I'm a bit out of my league here as I don't drink beer but I'm betting
that some of you do. ;-^) Let's post your suggestions and then I'll make
the arrangements. We've got one month of lead time so I think we're ok
on that. We'd also want to brain storm some of the PR stuff.

The Linux in Schools folks are trying to send a group of 20 teachers to
NECC, the largest tech/edu conference in the US. There will be 10,000+
teachers there. We have teachers who have submitted proposals to present
from all over the country but we don't really have much funding to help
them with the costs of a trip like this. How would you folks feel about
a cover charge that would go to fund travel and registration expenses
for teachers who are accepted to present at NECC?
http://ccenter.uoregon.edu/conferences/NECC2003/

BTW I love what happens when you search for necc seattle on google!

I'd also like to explore some kind of business related event. Is there
someone with enough business/IT connections to bring together a luncheon
for Friday or Monday? We're working on getting some of the school IT
folks together for something like that. Who has some thoughts along
these lines?

Given that you want to do this on a Saturday, we will need to move fast

Is this going to be yet another Survival of the Loudest, or will people who 
are not pushy and obnoxious get a chance to get a word in? Quiet people with 
manners often know one or two things worthy of sharing. I'd like to support 
the event, but not if it's another typical geekfest where the annoying ones 
dominate.

You're right Russ, it's just that a lot of times (as in the case of the
"oggtst" code which started this discussion) there isn't an rpm readily
available, forcing novice users like myself to delve deeper even though
they just want things to work out of the box.  I'm thinking about
devoting some time to understanding RPM-building so that I can package
for other novices readily installable rpms for certain really useful
applications on the distros I'm using.  Redhat is to blame for this
particular problem, because they dropped mpg support in RH 8.0, but
failed to more completely support an replacement media-type (ogg-vorbis
being the obvious candidate).

I've been attempting to upgrade the kernel on my laptop running woody for
about a week and I keep losing my ethernet card every time.  Finally, with
the (infinite) help (and patience) of another list user, I got it solved.

# apt-get install pcmcia-source

This put pcmcia-cs.tar.gz in my /usr/src/ directory.  Untarred it, went into
the new directory (/usr/src/modules/pcmcia-cs) and, of course, read the
README file.  Which told me to :

# make configure
# make all
# make install

When I rebooted the system, my ethernet card started blinking again.  This
was a 2.2.20 -> 2.2.21 upgrade.  The 2.4.19 attempt failed miserably, so I'm
taking baby steps...

Hope that helps.  If not you, then someone else with a Netgear FA511 card
and a laptop.

Or Kennedy School.  Or Forest Grove (which is Very Empty from what I

I think the more central locations are probably better.
That way we can draw from east side, west side, north to
Vancouver, south to Wilsonville without anyone having to
drive more than 1/2-hour (barring rush-hour freeway stuff).
Forest Grove would probably lose half of us (no transit
either).

The Bridgeport is an excellent choice.  Kennedy school
could be cool.

Forest Grove would lose me and I live in Hillsboro. I don't want to ride
my bike down TV highway in the rain and dark in Forest Grove. No thanks.

Anywhere downtown is better. Transit, remember. Many of us don't drive to
these things.

And that's just ONE of the reasons that linux isn't quite ready for the 
masses.

Of course, there are two ways to think of this. One, the user that 
doesn't know how (or care to) compile his own programs probably doesn't 
need to be running that bleeding edge piece of software that's on 
version 0.04, or two, the package maintainers need to realize that not 
everyone knows how, or cares to know how, to roll their own, and they 
should provide the packages if they can. Otherwise, it's up to the 
distributions to do it, and they may not package it the way the 
maintainer wishes. There's a whole slew of reasons...

Check to see if some people are already doing this. In many cases, the 
maintainers of a package will readily accept help and put the packages 
up with the rest of their stuff.

Yeah. Damn patent holders. Redhat was stuck between a rock and a hard 
place. Being THE major distribution in North America, they are the 
obvious first target. I'm sure they couldn't afford to be sued over 
licensing fees for mp3 decoders. From what I understand, the fee is 
$.75, per decoder, wether it's sold or given away. So each ISO image, 
times the number of mp3 decoders, and you have a hefty chuck of change. 
I probably would have done the same thing given the same circumstances.

Are you reffering to a hard drive or a floppy drive.
If you want, I have a hard drive 3,2 Gb. I also have a
floppy drive, but I don't want to give it away unless
I give the ThinkPad 600 away too. I cand give you the
entire computer if you want. Just contact me off the list.

I tried Freshmeat, then Google. Goggle turned up gnometoaster. I was trying to
find the web page for the utility as I have never heard of it before to see
what it does. I was looking for a site with the tarball and saw the rpm listed
above the source. I don't know if this is a gnometoaster project or not. I
couldn't really find any information. The only other hits on google were for
Debian sites with debs. 

Thank you

Subject: [PLUG] Losing mozilla bookmarks
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0210150628390.18904-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  This new "feature" is extremely annoying. I save a bookmark in
mozilla-1.0.3 (not sure about the release digit) by pressing ctrl-d, check
that it shows up in the bookmark list, then find it gone the next day. This
has happened several times over the past couple of weeks and never before.

  Has anyone else experienced this lose of a bookmark? Can someone suggest
why it might be happening or what I can do to prevent losing them in the
future?

Thanks,

Rich

... actually, when gatherings are sufficiently large, I find
the opportunity to break down into smaller groups (table-sized
clusters), and drift from table to table until one finds a
comfortable group/topic to settle down a good environment.

Does anyone know what format RedHat uses for these events?

Message-ID: <7B2F6EA5E35E214882CB9828962BC3CF01D82519@corvallis.summit.fiserv.com>

Hi all.

I just got ATT Cable installed yesterday and am building a box to use with
it right now. My question , and I hope some of you who have already done
this will know, is that in order to get the box I want to use as my gateway
installed I have been told that I need to "register the MAC address" in
order to get DHCP working. The guy who installed it, he was very good about
sharing what knowledge he had, gave me a account number, registration code,
and a web site https://sas.r1.attbi.com to "register the MAC address" with.
(Note the parts in quotes are his words) So my question is I have to
register the MAC address to get an address and DNS info. I have to have an
address and DNS info to register a MAC address. So how do I do this? I do
have access to a Win2k laptop if that would help. Also if I ever swap out
the device, for example later I want to go wireless, how would one do this?
Here is hoping that one of you all have been through this. Any help would be
much appreciated. Thanks.

Ray

Yes, a 250-watt unit. I'm assuming that it's adequate considering the
box the board came out of had a supply rated for only 145 watts (!).

Sounds like an interesting lead. Too bad I don't know where to begin.
:-)  Google searching for "kernel disable nmi command line" doesn't
bring up anything helpful. Any leads?

11/17 Sunday     $500      $650
11/18 Monday     $350      $500

It is possible for non-profits to get a discount, but the reservation
has to be made well in advance (3-4 months).

BTW, if you think this is expensive, you obviously haven't gotten married

Kennedy School is close to 2 bus routes: the 33rd bus stops right in
front of the building (IIRC, the #10), & the Killingsworth bus -- a
cross-town bus that doesn't go downtown -- has a stop only two short
blocks away.

And I'll admit to having a bias for Kennedy School: I live within walking
distance of it. A 30-45 minute walk (one way), but still within walking
distance.

FYI - this get discussed about once a month.  See here 
http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/  for the archives.  Karl 
mentioned there was a search function, but I can't seem to find it at 
the moment.

That said, when I had ATT Broadband (we're in the middle of a move), I 
didn't have to go to said site to hook up a different machine to the 
modem.  As soon as the tech left, I unplugged the cord from the laptop, 
plugged it into the open port on my firewall, and after a couple of 
hours of tweaking scripts and such, it was up and running.

YMMV.

The "spare" I was referring to was indeed a floppy drive, but I 
certainly wouldn't turn down the offer of a 3.2GB hard drive -- the 
current one is 800MB, which is obviously a little bit of a tight fit for 
a full Debian install.

I'm probably not interested in *buying* a 600 series, if only because it 
lacks the one feature that attracted me to the 560: light weight, and 
thin/compact form factor. If you don't want the ThinkPad 600 or the 
add-ons (floppy, HD, etc.) either, though, I would be more than happy to 
have them.

	I'd like to chime in as the (lone?) "voice of dissension", 
vis-a-vis the location. ...

	Everyone seems to naturally gravitate toward some McMenamins 
property. This is understandable, given the LARGE number of these 
places all over Portland. I have always been enamored with the raw 
creativity in each one, with respect to preservation of the original 
building architecture, etc., and these places have certainly achieved 
a cult following.
	However, the food and service at ANY McMenamins just BLOWS. 
Why people keep going to a place that is ONLY about atmosphere is 
strange to me. These places are PUBS and restaurants, and the food is 
pedestrian, at best!
  	Paradoxically, some people DO find the food and service 
adequate. However, I consider this one of the essential mysteries of 
the universe. ... Though I suppose that if someone is nostalgic for 
the feeling of being so stoned that you don't care about the quality 
of the food you eat, then any McMenamins could well be an acceptable 
choice.    ;-)

	I, obviously, vote for Bridgeport.

That may prove to be the case. In any case I will be testing later and let you all know. My communication with the cable tech though answered most of my question. It would seem that they have proxies that will give you an address but are then only supposed to let you go to the site in question to resister and after that you are supposed to be good. So having said that does anyone know how to search the list archives. I can't find it.

FYI - this get discussed about once a month.  See here 
http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/  for the archives.  Karl 
mentioned there was a search function, but I can't seem to find it at 
the moment.

That said, when I had ATT Broadband (we're in the middle of a move), I 
didn't have to go to said site to hook up a different machine to the 
modem.  As soon as the tech left, I unplugged the cord from the laptop, 
plugged it into the open port on my firewall, and after a couple of 
hours of tweaking scripts and such, it was up and running.

YMMV.

	These errors and code snippets would indicate that this 
"HTML" was created by "exporting" some MS document to HTML. Microsoft 
LOVES to "export" almost anything as HTML, and they tend to use XML 
code in the result.
	In addition, any MS "exported" data nearly always contains MS 
"hooks" to MS products. (e.g. MS Word document, exported to HTML, 
would likely contain FrontPage or Access "hooks".) This is what you 
are seeing.

	You don't have to "purchase" MS Internet Explorer, which is 
why this browser now (statistically) accounts for roughly 90% of the 
browser market. The current "trend" is for (so called) Web developers 
to only code for MSIE. Sad, but true.

This worked beautifully (by the third or so attempt when I fixed my own 
mistakes).

Here's what I did (for the archives):

1) "Pretend" to install Windows 2000 on the target disk:

   a) Boot off the Windows 2000 Professional CDROM.
   b) Tell it you want to do a fresh install.
   c) Choose the target drive.
   d) Create the partition, format NTFS.
   e) Let it copy files.

2) Use GHOST to copy from source (working Windows install to transfer) to
   target:

   a) After the initial file copy in (1e), the installer will reboot.  
      Intercept this reboot and boot from GHOST DOS boot floppy.
   b) Start GHOST.  Copy from Windows 2000 partition on source disk to 
      freshly-created, partially installed (from 1e) Windows 2000 partition 
      on target disk.
   
3) Reboot.

That's all it took.

No you don't have to purchase IE but I'm not aware of any OS that it runs on that you do not have to purchase. I guess you could run it on Sun or HPUX but for most desktop users this would mean that you would have to buy Windows.

  I have a pdf file (one page) that allows us peasants to fill in the
blanks, but not save the filled-in form. Today, it won't print. Neither
directly to the printer nor from a postscript file written to disk. A couple
of weeks ago, it worked just fine.

  When I try printing, the printer's LEDs flash, "processing job", then it
stops processing after a few seconds and returns to comatose mode. Same
thing when I try to print the file from disk.

  Very strange and hasn't happened to me before. This is
Acroread-5.something. Has anyone seen this happen before?

  I have the postscript file if someone could discern the problem from
looking at it.

Thanks,

Rich

You didn't specify which bootloader you're using. If you use lilo, at the
boot prompt do...

    linux nmi_watchdog=0

In grub, use the command line interface to add...

    nmi_watchdog=0

...to your kernel line.

If that works, then for lilo you can add...

    append="nmi_watchdog=0"

...to the stanza in lilo.conf for your kernel du jour and then rerurn lilo.
This will take care of future boots so that you don't need to specify it on
the command line during boot. 

In grub, you'd add...

    nmi_watchdog=0

...to your kernel specification in grub.conf. e.g.,

    kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.18-5smp ro root=/dev/hde3 noapic nmi_watchdog=0
    (ymmv)

See Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt in your kernel source tree for more info
about NMIs.

Sandy

  I hate it when stuff is advertised or otherwise promoted as "free" 
  when it's really just included with purchase price, e.g., the 
  so-called Free Continental Breakfast at hotels.

  Stuff is only free of cost when no other purchase is necessary to 
  get and/or use it (as even that sort of free, as Jeme will no doubt 
  point out, isn't necessarily anywhere close to Free :-).

I believe it's actually the mac address of the cable modem itself that
needs to be registered.
I did the following:
- Plugged a win xp box into the cable modem directly
- Ran the disk they give you
- tested the connection etc.
- unplugged that box & plugged in my open bsd router, hub etc
& it all worked fine

Enjoy,

Hi all.

I just got ATT Cable installed yesterday and am building a box to use
with
it right now. My question , and I hope some of you who have already done
this will know, is that in order to get the box I want to use as my
gateway
installed I have been told that I need to "register the MAC address" in
order to get DHCP working. The guy who installed it, he was very good
about
sharing what knowledge he had, gave me a account number, registration
code,
and a web site https://sas.r1.attbi.com to "register the MAC address"
with.
(Note the parts in quotes are his words) So my question is I have to
register the MAC address to get an address and DNS info. I have to have
an
address and DNS info to register a MAC address. So how do I do this? I
do
have access to a Win2k laptop if that would help. Also if I ever swap
out
the device, for example later I want to go wireless, how would one do
this?
Here is hoping that one of you all have been through this. Any help
would be
much appreciated. Thanks.

I think you highly overrate the quality of food at McMenamins pubs.
Restaurants like the Black Rabbit OTOH have great fare.  

As to why people go there see
http://mikeraz.patch.com/writing/beernotes/nwbn1999March.html which is an
article I wrote for Northwest Beer Notes (may it rest in peace) in March

I think BridgePort is the best fit for location, ability to handle the crowd
size, and food/beverage/service quality.

I have no problem at all with McMinimans food, at least in
the Kennedy School or Blue Moon.

My favorite in the McMinimins chains (and they do have
separate meeting rooms) is the Kennedy School near
Alberta. It is served by the number 9 bus and had
good parking.

Subject: [PLUG] Configuring a CD Burner
Message-ID: <3DAC8AE8.39201C17@attbi.com>

On my RH 7.0 machine, I have an HP 7200 series CD burner. I've never
used it for burning CDs. It works fine for reading, but when I try to
use cdrecord, I discover from the man page that I need a SCSI device. I
note that this can be a virtual device and that somehow I can load a
driver and map it. 

I've tried reading the HOWTO at:

http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/html_single/CD-Writing-HOWTO.html

It only makes partial sense to me. I tried running the scripts in the
Quickstart section, but didn't learn anything useful. Can anyone
recommend another source of information on how to configure an IDE CD
burner?

(I did figure out how to prepare the data with mkisofs.)

Thanks.

Put this in lilo.conf:

append="hdb=ide-scsi"

in the proper section for the currently booting kernel.  Substitute your
CD-R device name instead of hdb (probably hdc or hdd in a typical setup). 
Run lilo -v.  If you're not running lilo, I dunno anything about grub. 
Someone around here probably does.
You have to load the module, or if you're lucky it's in the kernel,  for
ATAPI ide-scsi emulation (called ide-scsi).  You also need SCSI support
and SCSI generic support modules or built into the kernel.  This should
get you going in the right direction.  I had it up after a few failed
attempts (and kernel recompiles).

Yes I think it is. BTW and off topic. What is a good spot for buying parts for computers in the Portland/Hillsboro area? Is Fry's the cheapest or is there some place else good?

Is this the way to know the device?
[rstef at NEC /dev]$ ls -l cdrom
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            3 Mar  3  2001 cdrom -> hdc 

Here is my lilo.conf:
[rstef at NEC /etc]$ cat lilo.conf
boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
message=/boot/message
linear
default=linux

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.16-22
        label=linux
        read-only
        root=/dev/hda1

Should I put append="hdc=ide-scsi" right after the block that says
image= so that it would look like:

boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
message=/boot/message
linear
default=linux

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.16-22
        label=linux
        read-only
        root=/dev/hda1

append="hdc=ide-scsi"

Lilo is what I'm running.

Does the following mean that the module is loaded, or that it's
available to be loaded?

[root at NEC /root]# modprobe -l | grep ide-scsi
/lib/modules/2.2.16-22/scsi/ide-scsi.o  

There are a lot of other scsi related lines if I grep on just scsi.

Thanks for the help.

Yeah.  Try to mount it and see.  It could be just a default symlink to hdc.

Yep looks like it's loaded, which probably means it loads at boot.  Try
running lilo and rebooting and see what happens.

I ran lilo -v and then rebooted. Here's what I get, now.

Also, putting a music CD in no longer works. When I run a music playing

the above stuff.

Message-ID: <000f01c274c0$61f3b6a0$e984d38c@Endeavor>


Upon following the walkthrough at:
http://advosys.ca/papers/printable/postfix-filtering.html

I still can't make the final jump to get this working.  Towards the end
of the document, I am instructed to change the following line that
controls the smtp daemon as follows:

smtp   inet  n   -   n   -   -   smtpd -o content_filter=filter:

...trouble is I HAVE no such line...my similar one lists bsmtp
(attached) as follows:

bsmtp     unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
  flags=Fq. user=foo argv=/usr/local/sbin/bsmtp -f $sender $nexthop
$recipient

I should also point out this is on two lines, and not one line as
suggested by Advosys's document.

System:
Stock Redhat 7.2 i386
1ghz Duron / 128mb / 60gb IDE
postfix (unsure of version, beleive it to be latest back in April 2002)
Anomy version 1.55 Spamassassin - fetched from CPAN today (10/15/2002)

Suggestions?

In the contruction trades, tyvek is used as house wrap. You should be
able to find large rolls of the stuff at building supply centers.

Message-ID: <20021016051708.12595.qmail@web13807.mail.yahoo.com>

If you have scsi emulation enabled your previous IDE
device will no longer work (i.e. /dev/hdX), but only
for the devices you specify in lilo.conf. You should
access it via its new scsi device name (/dev/scd0 on
my Debian system, I've also heard of /dev/sd0).

It may be purely for asthetic reasons, but I think you
should indent the append line in your lilo.conf file
so that it's alligned with the others.

Also, did you reboot? That may be the reason that
cdrecord messes up like that.

Anyway, just some ramblings from someone who thinks
they know everthing. This advice may work, or it may
be crap. I don't know which.

Check the web page, they want the MAC address of the cable modem, not your

This info is for a 2.4 kernel. I haven't played with a 2.2 kernel in a while so
I don't know if this is accurate for that series.

cat  /proc/scsi/scsi

cat /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info

This will tell you what your drive is.

/dev/cdrom is probably still pointing at /dev/hdc. You will need to remove the
link and create another to the device name you got from
/proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info i.e. drive name:	      sr0 in my case.

If you don't get any info then you need to look for two modules, ide-scsi and
sg. Both are required for scsi emulation. If you didn't setup scsi emulation by
appending hdc=ide-scsi to lilo; if you install ide-scsi and then sg modules, it
will map your ide cdrom to a scsi /dev/whatever. You don't have to reboot. The
append in Lilo and reboot is so you have the scsi emulation at boot and don't
have to manually load modules. I like to know about loading and unloading sg
because I have had CDRWs that were a little flaky. I buy cheap. 

I like this shell script because I don't have to remember the directories in
/proc.

That's where you've totally lost me.  Compiling software is NOT
development in any sense of the word.

Not only is it possible to develop software without compiling anything
ever, but it's possible to compile software without doing any development.

Saying that compiling software from source is development is a bit like
saying dubbing a minidisc is composing music.

It MIGHT be part of A development process, that doesn't make it
development.  See previous post on the subject.

According to you, those people don't really WANT a general purpose
computer at all.  They want an information appliance.

You and me.

Again, you say he wants an appliance, not a general purpose computer.

See, I totally disagree with this on just about every level.

I reject your assertion that "the vast majority of computer users" have no
need or desire for the ability to compile software from source.  You don't
know the hearts of any majority anywhere and neither do I.

I absolutely reject the idea that there's nothing wrong with that supposed
state of affairs.  Failure of the public to DEMAND the capabilities
inherent in a general purpose computing device will lead a world in which
such devices are not common, inexpensive, and available.  That world is
one managed by information-owning oligopolies who control not only how you
see the world but which parts of it you see at all.  Willfull ignorance by
the majority results in power (through knowledge and skills) consolidating
in the hands of the few and the temptation to use that power to exploit.  
Not caring about and learning how the systems in your world operate (be
those your computer, your bicycle, your public agencies, or your body)
makes one more and more complacent, lazy and gullible over time.

There are plenty of people constructing binary distributions for no pay
whatsoever.  There are other valid means of human interaction than
commerce.

Being free to make choices is great.  But that doesn't mean it's great to
make any and all choices.  Choosing to be lazy and complacent or exploit
the laziness and complacency of others is not great... not by a long shot.

He needs it to maintain his personal and social freedom.  He may not want
it, but by giving up his own freedoms, he risks the freedoms of others and
that is destructive, sociopathic behavior.

This isn't a question of style.  It's not dots vs. stripes or even vi vs.
emacs.  Style is ultimately superficial and determines only HOW an
endeavor is carried out.  This is a question of whether or not an endeavor
(namely, the defense of our free lives) is carried out at all.

Alan,

  Try calling Home Depot for a telephone number for Johns Mansville. They
make building insulation that is faced with tyvek. Or, do a google search
and browse the 101,000 hits on Dupont's TYVEK it returned. Including a
couple of paid spots that sell the stuff.

i set up the domain on another dns server as a slave server, so that i
could still update my local machine and it would notify the slave server
of changes.

everytime it tries to make a transfer, i get this.
#/var/log/syslog
dns named[1246]: client 208.151.x4x.x25#1102: zone transfer
'thevacant.com/IN' denied


# /etc/named.conf
zone "thevacant.com" {
        type master;
        file "/var/named/thevacant.com.hosts";
        allow-transfer{
               208.151.x4x.x25;
        };
};

in the zone file on the 'local' machine
i have the proper dns name of the server as a NS record.



am I missing a step?

Thanks.

It is a long sad story of a geek without a computer. My old P2 gave up the ghost last week. I had to wait for payday to replace it. The parts are getting here today. In the meantime I've been unable to check the webpage. Thanks for the info though.

Check the web page, they want the MAC address of the cable modem, not your

In the contruction trades, tyvek is used as house wrap. You should be

	Pardon me, but it's only a "great place to drink beer" if you 
like Ales.    :-/

	I prefer the less-bitter, more mature, and smoother Lagers to 
any Ale. McMenamins can't take the time to actually WAIT for their 
beer to mature, so all they crank out is ales. If you like bitter 
beer, then this isn't a problem. However, if you - like me - prefer 
lagers, then nearly all of the Northwest microbrews are a 
disappointment, as most are ales. Saxer, Thomas Kemper, and some 
courageous others dare to buck this decidedly British trend.

	Lagers take TIME to brew. Different (bottom-fermenting) 
yeast. Needs refrigeration to make the yeast do it's job. Just can't 
set this kind of operation up in your kitchen, for instance.

	As I said, I agree with you about the atmosphere at nearly 
any (NE Broadway is a notable exception) McMenamins. However, I 
disagree with most people regarding the quality any of the properties 
culinary, service or beverage offerings. To each their own, right?

	Nice article, btw.    ;-)

Wow.  I've never even heard of a serial (RS-232) CD-ROM.  I suspect your
chances of getting this working are not very good.

Do you have a manufacturer and model number of the CD-ROM drive?  That
might help lead someone here in the right direction.

Yet again, I will not argue with you. My opinion is that compiling 
software is not an absolute must is the computer world. I'm also of the 
opinion (after talking to tens of thousands of computer users over the 
last 10 years) that users don't want to compile software.

In your opinion. I have a much larger view. He wants his computer to 
run, and he wants to be able to install (I said install, not compile) 
software in an easy manner, and have it work.

That more than anything else is why Windows has more "users". You can 
get the software, run the install procedure, and it usually works.

At the same time, I abhor users that "click [Next] as fast as possible" 
to get things installed. I *do* feel that users have to understand some 
of what they are doing.

I just don't think they need to know how to compile to use the computer.

And I disagree with that. They have the RIGHT to be ignorant, if they 
choose to be. You know, honor diversity and all that. You can't just 
honor diversity as long as it matches your diversity.

Then you reject the very premise that one can CHOOSE to be ignorant.

And that is their choice! It's called freedom of choice. They can do 
that if they so believe it's the right course of action.

You may not agree, and you can do what you want to try to change their 
minds, but I'll still fight for their right to be ignorant if they want 
to be.

Maybe. Won't put bread on my table. I deal with the world as it

I agree. But those that choose to be lazy (as you call them) have that

But don't you see, if you *FORCE* someone to do something that they

What is the basic difference between compiling software and "simply" installing it. I'm not a coder. For me compiling something consists of a small handful of commands. Most of the problems that pop up during a make install would just show up later and in other ways. Now I have installed almost everything on every system I've used for many years with apt. The exceptions being the occasional drivers and winders boxen I'm forced to use at work. With the new machine I'll be building this weekend I'll do the source thing with apt for everything except the base install. Why cause it is going to be fast and I want to watch it burn cycles. But there is *no* basic difference. Compiling can and is packaged behind various frontends. The average user does not understand an install wizard anymore than they would understand compiling and as long as the frontend consisted of making some basic choices and clicking ok it would be basically the same process. 

My point being that with the exception of coders there is almost no difference between the two processes and almost no difference in errors etc. BTW installing software does not get much easier than a Debian box once it is built. I think users don't care and just want the frontends they think they know.

Hiya, pluggers.

Subject sez it all. I'm looking for a Linux replacement for MS Exchange.

I've got about 20 people on Win2K boxen and we're running a Linux server (or
about to - it goes live this weekend...) and while I'd love to move everyone
to Linux, we have too many software packages that we rely on that are
Windows-only.

All I really need is the contact list and calendar management and sharing
features of Exchange, as we'll be using PostFix.

Any help?

The first question of course is what client you want to use or if you even care.

If you don't care perhaps phpgroupware?

Also, this would be a bit more longterm, you might look at this.

Michael;

Bynari's Insight Server is reported to be a drop-in replacement for Exchange.

  http://www.bynari.net/bynari/products.html

We hosted a presentation about the server from the network administrator
from a local company. He reported the only difference was that it was a
lot more reliable and that the configuration was much easier to restore in
the event of a disaster!

Very interesting node that someone has posted on Perlmonks:
http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=205801

Essentially, the person built a site for an "unnamed" company that's very
large and infests the 9th Circle of Hell, also known as Redmond, WA.

He built the site using Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Perl.  The unnamed company
objected and stated the site could only use the unnamed company's products.
The person resorted to spoofing the header information to incorrectly report
the underlying technologies, thus leading NetCraft to "confirm" that the
technology switch was made.

SuSE already has a nice product, SuSE Linux eMail Server 3.1. Based on 
Postfix, Cyrus, OpenLDAP, and Squirrelmail. See 
http://networking.earthweb.com/netos/article/0,,12083_1466561,00.html for a 
brief review by the fabulous me.

Bynari and Caldera's Volition are similar, and work well, what I don't like is 
they both charge client licenses for server products. SuSE's email server is 
one price no matter how many users connect.

A better solution for you might be Time & Chaos, it's a Windows shared 
calendar/contacts app. It works great on either a peer network, or 
server/client. http://www.isbister.com/chaos32.html.  It won't be all 
mega-integrated like Exchange/Outlook, but it's inexpensive, stable, and a 
hell of a lot easier to admin than Exchange.

Thanks, Cooper.

I had looked at their site before, but when I went back this time I actually
*read* what was there :)

They do indeed have a free version, albeit not their latest. Soooo.... I'm

Michael;

Bynari's Insight Server is reported to be a drop-in replacement for
Exchange.

  http://www.bynari.net/bynari/products.html

We hosted a presentation about the server from the network administrator
from a local company. He reported the only difference was that it was a
lot more reliable and that the configuration was much easier to restore in
the event of a disaster!

Anyone know of a good cross platform setup for this sort of thing? I don't
need email service or any of that goings-on, I just want a good way for my
husband and I to share contacts/calendars, between OSX and his Wintendo.
I've looked for something to do this, but there is no Outlook for OSX so I

Does he use a PalmOS device?  And not mind double syncing?  He could
perhaps sync the Palm between OSX and then Windows to keep consistent
schedules and contacts on both..

Granted I've not installed a winders box since 98 was new. But does not even a normal winders install overwrite the MBR without asking? 

Also it would seem to me that since you paid for the license you would be morally if not legally justified in getting a copy of XP from how shall we say less than official sources.

Message-ID: <3DADED5C.3D73757A@attbi.com>

Many thanks to all who offered advice, particularly to Matt King for
walking me through several steps of this process, and to Russell Evans
for his suggestions for figuring out to which channel my CD Burner is
connected.

For the archives, here's how I got my CD Burner working on a RH 7.0
machine. (Note that if your burner is connected to a different cable,
you would need to use something other than hdc in the first step.)

Add  append="hdc=ide-scsi"  to my lilo.conf file. Then run
  lilo -v
and reboot the machine. On my machine, it was necessary to run
  mknod /dev/sr0 b 11 0
  modprobe ide-scsi
and
  modprobe sg

Now, when I run
  cdrecord -scanbus
it reports:

Cdrecord 1.9 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1995-2000 J?rg Schilling
Linux sg driver version: 2.1.38
Using libscg version 'schily-0.1'
scsibus0:  0,0,0     0) 'HP      ' 'CD-Writer+ 7200 ' '3.01' Removable
CD-ROM

I successfully burned a CD with an image made from mkisofs with:
  cdrecord dev=0,0 /home/public/cd.iso

Along the way, I got useful information from running:
  lsmod   
to learn what modules are currently loaded, and
  dmesg
  cat  /proc/scsi/scsi
  cat /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info
which told me that my CD-Burner is on hdc - thanks, Russell.

There appear to be only two concerns. 

1) Playing a music CD doesn't work right. When I pop a music CD into the
drive, one of the player applications starts up, and acts like it's
playing, but there's no sound. cdparanoia still works, and gramophile
will play a .wav file ripped with cdparanoia.

2) Ripping with cdparanoia seems to take much longer than it did before.

Other than that, I'm quite satisfied with the results. Thanks again to
all those who helped.

  Why not have only linux on the box? If you need one or two MS apps, would
it be a worthwhile investment to buy a copy of vmware or win4lin and use
those?

I think the 32 bit Windows versions write their own boot loader to the MBR 
and set the active partition but otherwise don't modify the partition table.

Let's see, morally justified actions regarding Microsoft...  Hmmm...

He is hot taking about overwriting the MBR.  You can do that without

as well.)

That version of XP is overwriting the *partition table*.  This causes any 
of your other data to \go away, not just be inaccesable.  (Especially 
since this step is followed by a format.)

Hi Rich,

I need to demo Linux interacting with Windows (Samba, DNS, DHCP, etc.) and 
now have enough CPU/RAM to run vmWARE and was trying various configurations 
when this problem arose.

Cheers,

Win2K server with 20 licenses, MS Exchange - you're already talking about

I'm looking at Bynari - it's installed and now I'm perusing the

I'll probably also take a look at the SuSE solution. I prefer open source

Again?  Coupled with when?

You wrote that when you compile software "you ARE doing development
work".  I countered that and you say you will not argue.  So you changed
your mind and you agree with me?

So it IS dumb to call them -devel packages when they have are required for
tasks that are NOT development.  That was my whole point.

Unless you want every programmer in the world to write in machine code,
compiling software IS an absolute must in the computer world.

So?  What does this have to do with the fact that -devel packages are
badly named?

Understand that this is a very different argument than whether or not
"devel" packages are properly named.  I'd like to keep them separate.

How is your view "much larger" when it considers only immediate, selfish
desires and fails to consider long-term social implications?

To this type of user that you describe, it doesn't matter whether the
software compiles locally or not.  If it's easy and it works, this
apathetic slob doesn't care, right?

> That more than anything else is why Windows has more "users".

I think you should probably take a look at your industry history again.  
There are lots of reasons Windows has more users than anything for which
source code is available and none of them have to do with being easier and
more opaque.

That's no different than what I do.  I get the software and run the
install procedure.  And it usually works.

They don't and I don't believe anyone implied that they did.  I wrote that
they SHOULD and that failing to understand the inner workings of their
systems is ultimately destructive to themselves and their society.  But I
didn't write that can't use those systems in some capacity without knowing
how to use them to their full capacity.  That's absurd.  Hell, my father
can work a VCR for some purposes.

Wow.

That kind of reasoning would lead one to statements like, "They have the
RIGHT to have sex with their children." or "They have the RIGHT to shit in
the park."  "Honor diversity, brother!"

Nobody has the right to be destructive and ignorance is socially
destructive.

I don't reject the premise that one can choose to be ignorant.  I reject

And I can help show them why it is NOT the right course of action.

What does that even MEAN?  How do you fight for the right to be ignorant?  
Will you work against education initiatives claiming that they violate

That's not true.  I know lots of people that would put bread on your table
without one bit of consideration for commerce.

Hell, I have friends and neighbors give me bread all the time.  And I
usually put it on my table.

Perhaps you should get up and try to improve your situation, then.

But they DON'T have that right because it impinges upon the rights of
others by creating a powerful exploitative class.

The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.  People who become ignorant and
complacent are not practicing their eternal vigilance and are, therefore,
sacrificing their freedom.  They are also threatening the freedom of every
other person by allowing a few people to use that ignorance and
complacence to gain power and that power can then be asserted over those
who DO practice their eternal vigilance.  And what do we do about threats
to our freedom?

"He" doesn't see it that way, sure.  But that's because of his precious
ignorance.  It is our responsibility as the informed to fight ignorance
and teach.

People DO normally have to defend their freedoms!  I don't think that I'd
be encouraging a person to do something they don't normally have to do by
encouraging them to practice eternal vigilance and work to be more
informed about the systems around them.

The only people that encourage ignorance are those who would like to
exploit it.  And those who exploit are looking to gain power and the
consolidation of power is a threat to freedom as a whole.

Fighting ignorance is defending freedom.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0210161637450.23228-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I have an opportunity to buy a 19" equipment rack (4' tall) for a very
good price. I'd like to build a couple of workstations and a firewall system
to fit in there and replace the under-desk units we have. But, I don't have
a clue how many "U" are in a 4' case, what size case I should look to buy,
and so on.

  For example, there's a case (appears to be 4U from the photos) on eBay;
atx form factor with a system board and a few other goodies. Might this be a
worthwhile buy? I'm trying to learn and would appreciate learning from those
of you who work with this type of equipment.

TIA,

Hey,

I currently work at a dentist's office and we are looking for a 
high-speed connection to the Internet.  I can get SDSL through Worldcom 
(who currently filed bankruptcy) and ISDN through QWest.  Since we 
currently have phone service through QWest, I was thinking this would be 
a good idea.  Also, I was hoping to switch to a Linux router with the 
addition of a high-speed connection (we have ICS over a modem currently, 
don't ask).  

So, should I go for ISDN with Linux, or use DSL?  Does Linux care 
whether I'm using ISDN or DSL?

Thanks

Unfortunately, since the user agreement reads as it does, he would only be
morally justified, not legally justified.

Mike - You can get all that software for like $1 as a teacher/student

Granted I've not installed a winders box since 98 was new. But does not even

Also it would seem to me that since you paid for the license you would be

According to Toshiba tech support, current MS license for WinXP on my new 
Toshiba notebook requires the reinstall CD to wipe the partition table when 
restoring the system effectively killing a dual boot (Linux) system.

Me: Why is this?
Tech support:  "Microsoft is concerned about supporting systems with 
modified partition tables (Microsoft doesn't support OEM customers).

Me: How do I get around the problem?
Tech support: "Buy a real copy of WinXP."

Unless you're doing hosting, SDSL is probably a waste of your money.

Earthlink DSL works great with Linux and offers a very competitive 
price.  Many local ISPs like Coho and Internet Arena also offer DSL, 
usually through Verizon.  Some also offer ISDN if you're sure that's what 
you want.

I wouldn't recommend working with Qwest unless it's strictly 
necessary.  I'd like to tell you about all the great experiences I've had 
setting up services with Qwest, but I don't think I've had one yet.

Yah, and that functionality is what business users want. Exchange makes such a 
horrible hash of things- I'm sure I don't need to rant to you about how it 
mucks up backups and restores, and needs enough hardware to power the 
Pentagon just to serve a few users, and calculating all the various licenses 
would put a Google-sized cluster into a nervous breakdown, etc ad nauseum. 
Like on Star Trek, when they chased Jack the Ripper out of the computer by 
giving it an insoluble problem: "Compute, to the last digit, the sum total of 
our Microsoft licenses."

Ah yes, I forgot about the free version. That just might do the job. SuSE is 
$999, which is better than MS, but not better than free.

	Sounds to me like either they are admitting that you have a 
bootleg copy of XP, ... OR ... you need to hit them up for a refund 
for the copy of XP that you have. Either you have a MS license for 
your copy of XP, or you don't. If you DO, then they need to provide 
REAL customer service.

	I'd escalate this matter to that (tech support) idiots' manager.

	Well, I have to disagree with this.

	I had ISDN with Qwest, starting in 1995, then again last 
year. QWest will come to your house/business if your ISDN goes wacky. 
One bill, good service (really!).
	EarthLink works with local telco providers, so if you're in 
Qwest territory for your phone system, you're going to end up working 
with Qwest whether you want to or not. Deal with it.

	FYI, I wrote the original article on ISDN for ComputerBits 
magazine, several years ago. Search under my name, if you care.

It means you don't have 11Mb free on your root partition.
Type,
	$ df -h
to see what you have where.

Re: /dev/shm on RH 7.3, the relevant part of `mount` says
   none on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)

probably similar to yours.  (Was surprised when the installer asked a 
bigger
swapfile, I already had allocated a generous swap partition).  But I don't
think this is your problem.  Open Office wants a permanent place to install
itself.

Type,
	$ rpm -qilp OpenOffice-suite-1.0-3.i386.rpm
you'll see where it wants to plant itself.  If it's /opt, then create a 
symlink
	$ln -s /home/on/the/range /opt

Hey all,

After much technological upheaval at my house, I'm up against this problem
once again. Two new hard drives and three reformats later, I finally got my
Samba Server on and the Wintendo is able to connect and do basic things:
read, copy to, and delete from the share he's connected to. However he
cannot rename files. Is rename a completely separate permission? It doesn't
matter if he logs in as himself (w/admin rights) or me (w/admin/su rights),
that machine is unable to rename on my machine. When he tries, it says "The
source or destination file may be in use". Any idea what could cause this?
My machine is running OSX, his is running Win2k Pro. I've tried all manner
of permission juju, googling for the error, thus far, no dice.  Help!

It's a trap!

Echelon is perhaps the most powerful intelligence gathering organization in
the world. Several credible reports suggest that this global electronic
communications surveillance system presents an extreme threat to the privacy
of people all over the world. According to these reports, ECHELON attempts
to capture staggering volumes of satellite, microwave, cellular and
fiber-optic traffic, including communications to and from North America.
This vast quantity of voice and data communications are then processed
through sophisticated filtering technologies.

This massive surveillance system apparently operates with little oversight.
Moreover, the agencies that purportedly run ECHELON have provided few
details as to the legal guidelines for the project. Because of this, there
is no way of knowing if ECHELON is being used illegally to spy on private
citizens.

:-)

And while I'm at it, why can't those satellites from the movie "Enemy of the
State" find the DC sniper?

I wouldn't bother with a linux isdn solution.  For about $100 you can get a 
used cisco 700 router in ebay.  If you get the right model 700 you can also 
get spare teleco ports on it and hook the fax machine up to one of the lines. 
 If a fax goes out it drops one of the 64k connections for the fax and 
continues routing data over the other 64k line.  Set that up and then set up 
a linux firewall. Let cisco do what it does best and linux do what it does 
best.

Obviously, a man's judgement cannot be better than the information on 
which he has based it.  Give him the truth and he may still go wrong 
when he has the chance to be right, but give him no news or present 
him only with distorted and incomplete data, with ignorant, sloppy or 
biased reporting, with propaganda and deliberate falsehoods, and you 
destroy his whole reasoning processes, and make him something less 
than a man.

I hope not.  I've got a dual PIII/350 and a PII/233 that I use all the 
time.  The dual is my desktop - mostly - but does extra service (as all 
good Linux systems do) as SAMBA server, Web Server, Database server and 
virtual CDROM server on my SOHO network.  The single will become the 
'server' soon so I can cram some more applications and data on the 
desktop.  :-)

Message-ID: <NAEMLOHDCGGNKGMHCPFGOEBKCAAA.jimwebb@charter.net>

I have a home network problem that has me puzzled.  I hope that somebody out
there has more smarts and/or experience to help me.

When my house was built I had cat5 jacks placed in 4 rooms.  The cable led
to a closet where I had my cable brought into the house.  In that closet I
have the cable connected to the Motorola modem which connects to my hardware
firewall.  This in turn is connected to an 8 port 10/100 Netgear hub.  I
have cat5 cable connected from the hub into wall jacks that lead back to the
4 rooms.

I noticed today that when I attempted to attach a 4 port Netgear 10/100 hub
in one of the rooms to the wall jack that I was unable to connect to the
network.  This is the same network that I can successfully connect out to
the internet when I have one pc, without the hub, connected to that same
wall jack.  I switched cat5 cables.  That didn't help.  I moved the hub into
another room and the same problem occurred.  I can connect to the internet
with one pc, but not after I connect one or more pc's through the hub.

A friend thought that it may be due to some IEEE standard about how the wall
jack might be set up, but he couldn't remember the details.

Has anybody seen anything like this?  Can anybody help????


TIA,

Jim Webb

Does the hub have an uplink port?  Hook it up to that port.  If not use a
crossover cable between the hub and the wall jack, then hook the other
systems up normally...

You have attempted to connect a hub/switch to a hub/switch.  This calls for a 
crossover cable.

Obviously, a man's judgement cannot be better than the information on 
which he has based it.  Give him the truth and he may still go wrong 
when he has the chance to be right, but give him no news or present 
him only with distorted and incomplete data, with ignorant, sloppy or 
biased reporting, with propaganda and deliberate falsehoods, and you 
destroy his whole reasoning processes, and make him something less 
than a man.

This may seem mundane, but are you connecting to the uplink port in the
4-port hub?  You will need to do this in order to chain a hub to another
hub/switch. 

I'm assuming you have lights on the hub and all that, right?  

If so, can you ping/see other computers in different rooms with a
computer connected through your 4-port hub?  

Can you ping/see computers connected to the same 4-port hub?

I've installed wall jacks before and have been able to chain hubs
together through them. I've run into other problems, but it sounds like
the 4-port hub either isn't working or isn't attached to the 8-port hub
properly.

Hi All Folks,

CPU  AMD Athlon 1.4G
Motherboard	  2thMax 8KHA
ATX system
OS	Rh8.0

I suffered this problem since running RH7.3.  My RH8.0 was upgraded from a 
RH7.3 box

During "shutdown PC" on graphic mode RH8.0 closed but the PC is not 
power-off.  Following text displayed on screen

- snip -
Halting system
md: stopping all md devices
flushing ide device : hda hdc hdd
Power down

The screen hangs here and power is still on.

When "shutdown PC" on Console window with command

# shutdown -y -g0

same result.

Previously I have been playing around with BIOS and PC setup but no 
solution reached

Any advice.

Thanks in advance.

Stephen Liu

I've replied in plug-talk, as this has gone WAY off-topic for the main list.

It seems to me that your problem is related to crossing transmit and
receives all over the place.  Nothing to do with wall jacks per se.

If you're going to connect a hub/switch to another hub/switch, you have to
go from a regular port on one to the "uplink" port on another or use a
crossover cable.

Slot 1 motherboards are getting hard to find. You'll find plenty listed 
on pricewatch.com, but the few that I ordered turned out to be out of 
stock.

I've seen this, too.  Some machines power themselves off (ATX only?), but 
not all.  Don't know what it is, but it is safe to hit the switch when you 
see "Power down".

I find it's helpful to see two things when looking at samba probs.:

1. The file permissions on the file in question.
2. The relevant sections of the smb.conf; i.e. the share definition.

Could you share those w/ us?

Did you find out where OpenOffice wants to install itself?

Is /dev/hda6 mounted? type `mount`
If it is not mounted (not in the list) and there is no line for it in 
/etc/fstab, then you probably won't step on anything by doing the following,

# mkdir /mnt/hda6
# mount /dev/hda6 /mnt/hda6
# cd /mnt/hda6

poke around.

If /dev/hda6 does show up in the previous `mount` command, it will tell you 
the mountpoint, something like
  /dev/hda6 on /usr type ext3 (rw)

Then you know that /usr is on that partition.

Make sense?

Does power management need to be enabled in the CMOS setup to get this

Obviously, a man's judgement cannot be better than the information on 
which he has based it.  Give him the truth and he may still go wrong 
when he has the chance to be right, but give him no news or present 
him only with distorted and incomplete data, with ignorant, sloppy or 
biased reporting, with propaganda and deliberate falsehoods, and you 
destroy his whole reasoning processes, and make him something less 
than a man.

Thanks to everyone for your assistance.  I hadn't thought about the concept
that I was attaching one hub to another hub even though they were in
different rooms.  I used the uplink switch and now I'm able to connect two
pc's from one room using the 4 port hub.

Thanks,

Jim Webb

Were you able to ever get any computers to talk to the internet through
the 4 port hub? Were you able to get any two computers to talk to each
other through only the 4 port hub? Were you able to get any two
computers to talk to each other through both the 4 port hub and the 8
port hub?

Were you using the uplink port on only _one_ of the hubs? (You've got to
use exactly one -- no more, no less[1].)

Do the answers to any of the previous questions change if you plug the 4
port hub directly into the 8 port hub, rather than using the in-built
wiring?

My guess is that you need to use the uplink ports on one of the hubs;
the 4 port might be 'easier', in the sense that it is more mobile than
the 8 port hub. But don't use the uplink ports on both. If this isn't
it, try the other questions as starting points for troubleshooting.


[1] with the exception of crossover cables, but this discussion is
complicated enough without bringing them into the middle of it. :)

Did you find out where OpenOffice wants to install itself?

Is /dev/hda6 mounted? type `mount`
If it is not mounted (not in the list) and there is no line for it in
/etc/fstab, then you probably won't step on anything by doing the following,

# mkdir /mnt/hda6
# mount /dev/hda6 /mnt/hda6
# cd /mnt/hda6

Thanks Kyle. It is actually  hda5 and I set up the mount for it.
I also added the last line for it in /etc/fstab. From # man /etc/fstab 
I'm assuming "1 2" is the proper nomenclature

FWIW: Here's my take on the various xU sizes:

* 1U  : looks cool, but loud since tiny fans spin so quickly
* 2U  : the sweet spot!
* 3U  : a bit big, but not bad
* 4U+ : too big unless you need lots of local disks

If you can, you might think about getting a rack-mountable UPS to 
stick at the bottom of your rack...

  Thanks, Rod. My main server/workstation is a PII/333 that's been reliable
for about 4-5 years now and the other workstation is a P-MMX/500 we've run
for 2-3 years. Unless I'm doing serious number crunching or spatial
analyses, the cpus are waiting on us to press the next key so that's plenty
fast for 98% of our use.

  But, if I can put together faster systems at a very reasonable cost, then
it will allow me to consolidate all the systems in a single rack and that
has some space advantages.

  Thanks, Paul. All sound advice.

  I may bid on a 4U case with motherboard; it's atx form factor for the
mounts so it should be upgradable in the future. Could put a couple of SCSI
drives there and use it as the server for our little LAN. Over time I can
add 2U units as workstations and firewall. I thought about the UPS problem,
too. It would be nice to remove three mini-/mid-/full tower cases and three
UPSes from the floor under the desks and simplify the wiring. I suppose that
I could velcro the DSL modem to the side of the rack, too. :-)

Ray,

Thank you for writing to AT&T Broadband.

I apologize for the confusion. Once you have your computer set to DHCP, you should then be able to gain an IP and then access the site you were given. The Servers are set to provide a basic 1 hr IP lease to perform this process.

You do not need to run the Virtual Technician software to gain the necessary connection.

If you do not know how to configure to DHCP for your system, or need more information on how to configure your computer, please visit:
http://help.broadband.att.com/faq.jsp?content_id=1729&category_id=93

This page will give you the instructions you need. Please remember, AT&T Broadband does not provide static IP addresses.

Your feedback is important to us. If you have any service-related concerns or questions, please contact our Online Customer Support Center at http://help.broadband.att.com. Our Online Customer Care Specialists are available 24-hours a day, seven days a week.

I do not want to run the virtual tech software. The person who installed the system said I could register my MAC address by going to https://sas.r1.attbi.com and putting in my account info and registration code. I have not tried this yet but my basic question is if I have to register the MAC address to make DHCP work and I need to have DHCP working to get an IP and get to the page to register the MAC address, How do I register my MAC address? I hope I have been clear if not please mail me with any questions you might have. And please note running the Virtual Tech software is *not* an acceptable answer. Thanks.

Any enscript hackers out there?  I've made a few mods to the states file
mostly for monochrome output of PostgreSQL scripts but now need some color
stuff for perl.  Anyone came up with a decent definition for colorized
perl code?  The default emacs colors pretty much suck.

If I have to do this myself I'd like to get some input on what parts of 
the code should be what color.  I'd prefer to leave it monochrome but 
since I'll be using it for presentation to and documentation for the 
not-perl-savy the color will add some flair. (Heck it might hide some of 
my less than optimal coding choices :-)


TIA,
Rod

Thanks for the suggestion. I did try the man page first! It had lots of 
great info on the options to use with it. I was just really looking for 
a good explanation of ALL the fields within the output of DiG. I am 
really new at networking and am trying to learn all this.

The differing timestamps suggest that /home and /mnt/hda5 aren't the
same filesystem. The lack of a lost+found directory in /home suggests
that it's part of the root (/) filesystem, while /mnt/hda5 is a
separate partition.

What's the output of 'mount' without any arguments?

Terrel,

  I thought that I had read all that on the man page. "IN" means Internet.
"MX" is Mail Server, "SOA" is the Start of Authority (the highest level
authoritative name server that knows how to reach that IP address) and "NS"
is the name of the Domain Name Server for that IP address.

HTH,

Rich

Dirk;

The 2.4.x kernels allow you to mount a partition containing a filesystem
to more than one location. My guess is that you mounted /dev/hda5 to
/mnt/hda5 sometime in the past and forgot about it.

I have used the multi-mount feature more than once. It is a very handy
thing to have.

If you do not wish to see /mnt/hda5 listed like this, simply unmount it:

   cd /
   umount /mnt/hda5

If it will not unmount, see the man page for `fuser.' If normal `nice'
things to not unmount this filesystem, perform the following:

   fuser -km /mnt/hda5
   umount /mnt/hda5

Paul's right. /home is a part of the root filesystem.

Hi Matt,

RH8.0

I tried almost half day and could not solve following problem:

1) On Samba server 
WinME can be mounted but the share folder could not be found.

2) On WinME 
Samba Server was found in the workgroup of the network.  But when
clicking it entry was denied.  Both WinME and Samba Server were there.

All test results and file details have been fully described in my first
posting

Thanks

Stephen

Possibly my question then is more in the header of the reply. The fields 
of "flag" (qr, aa, rd, ra) "authority", "id". What are these. I 
appreciate your replies today.

And as soon as you have more than three of them stacked up the
cable management gets to be a huge PITA.  Especially if you have
KVM cables running to each.

Okay, I installed Bynari. Wanted to try it out. Will have to wait.

Bynari seems to take over the whole machine. If you surf to your server,
i.e., 10.0.0.3, you get the (very nicely done) admin and config screens for
the Bynari server.

You also have to disable anything using FTP, HTTP, POP just to install it.
I'm starting to rething the whole thing.

Updates (probably) to follow...

<heinleins-maxim>
  A server is only ready for deployment when it can be fully managed
  with only two cables -- power and serial console -- and fully 
  deployed with only three -- the first two plus ethernet.

  Any extra cables for things like redundant power, UPS warnings, or 
  multiple NICs are just gravy.

  <corrolary>
    GUI-bound servers are never ready for deployment.

Which is why I like IBM's breakout cables for their Xseries 1U servers.
One cable comes off the server which then connects with the KVM cables
(under the floor).

A couple things I have "learned", rack-mount cases are *expensive*.
At least historically, they've been hard to find for less than
$150-250.  In comparison, a nice adequate mid-tower costs about $40.
Secondly, anything less than 3U means that you need to mount PCI cards
sideways with a little perpendicular adapter.  This naturally reduces
the utility of PCI slots.  I quote "learned" because I've never
actually brought myself to buy one, so my knowledge here is mostly
theoretical.

Thanks Paul.


The differing timestamps suggest that /home and /mnt/hda5 aren't the
same filesystem. The lack of a lost+found directory in /home suggests
that it's part of the root (/) filesystem, while /mnt/hda5 is a
separate partition.

What's the output of 'mount' without any arguments?


root]# mount
/dev/hda3 on / type ext3 (rw)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
usbdevfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbdevfs (rw)
/dev/hda1 on /boot type ext3 (rw)

none on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)

OK, here's more or less what I'd do if you want /dev/hda5 to become 
/home. Make sure everyone's logged out, then from the first virtual 
console

Hello Folks,

As usual there will be a Linux Clinic at Riverdale this Saturday, the
third Saturday of the month.

We'll have copies of Red Hat 8.0 and you can even burn a beta copy of
K12LTSP 3.0.

Info and directions: http://riverdale.k12.or.us/~danh/

Next month we'll have special guests at the clinic. Red Hat's bright red
motor home full of Red Hat folk will be joining us fresh from their road
tour. They'll be here on the third Saturday in November (Nov. 16) with
lots of freebies and information. Be sure to mark your calendar in RED
for this one.

;-) Paul

	You are confusing the company (Echelon telco) with the code 
name for a global surveillance operation. Normally, a company would 
have trademark issues with choosing a name that is already taken. 
However, the Eschelon surveillance operation isn't a company, so 
there's no conflict - at least with respect to trademark.

	Anybody want to start a "war chalking" club called "Wells 
Fargo"??    <grin>

This account needs to be a valid linux user (like nobody, which should
already be on your system), not the remote machine name.

Setting security to "user" will make trouble shooting a little easier,
then you will know what user is logged into the samba server.

What is the resolving order?  Did you set up (or designate) a wins
server?  What is the OS level?  Is there some sort of browse master (at
least local)?

>

> comment = test share 
> path = /test
> browseable = yes

> guest ok = yes 
> 

What about the /home entry?  If you change security to "user", the
/home/valid-linux-user directories become easy to access, as long as you
are logged into the Winbox as that linux user (and either use no
password, or the passwords should match on both machines).

It might help if you got rid of the second NIC in the Winbox, MS OS's
have a hard time keeping their routing tables straight.

Another piece of advise, reboot the Winbox frequently while you are
testing, often it is the only way to make it re-read the changes made on
the server.

Fear not, it will work.

No, this is a function in the kernel, most of the time APM is enable in
the kernel, but is set to NOT turn on with boot, you can turn it on with
an "append apm=on" (or something like that) in lilo.conf, there must be
something similiar to that for GRUB.

There is another kernel option called "Real Mode power down" (or
something like that) that needs to be set for the system to actually
power itself down.  This may start to function when apm is turned on, it
may not.  If it doesn't, you will need to compile your own kernel to
turn it on.

I would, but....

#1 - That's a LOT of disks. So obviously at least I would want compensated
for the 7 disks, whatever.

#2 - Is that even legal? I thought there was proprietary stuff on one of
the SuSE disks that made that illegal.

Is anyone signing up for the class?

Also, have you arranged to give the class at Madison High School?
If not, would you be interested in using my house?
I don't have much equipment, but I have a house close to MAX
with fast internet and a large room in the basement that I have
used for seminars with 20+ people.

I prefer 2U cases, since it at least allows a couple of add-on cards, 
which reduces costs. I found some really good 2U chassis at 
www.servercase.com. Seemed to be good folks to work with, even when I 
ordered 40 of one model at once.  2U is also good if you have to 
retrofit a slot 1/A processor motherboard. These won't fit in a 1U chassis.

If you don't want to deal with riser cards, then you either have to have 
all your peripherals on the motherboard, or go at least 3U to allow use 
of the slots in your motherboard.

The trade off being space saved. In a standard 44U (7 foot) rack, you 
can fit a max of 8 of those mid tower chassis. When doing this, I used 
2U for the UPS.

If I put 4U chassis in there, I can fit 10 machines in the same space.

If I put 2U chassis in there, I can fit 20 machines in there. (Need 3U 
for the UPS now)

Chassis have dropped markedly in the last couple of years. When I did my 
first 4U chassis, I opted for some that were $169 each, with 300Watt 
power supplies from Enlight. That was about 2 years ago.

Earlier this year, I outfitted 40 machines, and put them in 2U chassis 
that only cost $175, with 350 watt power supplies. These came with 3 
slot riser cards that actually plugged into three pci slots instead of 
simply extending one slot. As a comparison, when I bought the 4U chassis 
above, the least expensive 2U chassis I could find was $399.

Most 2U chassis come with a way to mount at least 2 PCI cards. BUT, you 
can't use the AGP  slot, so one of those PCI slots will be your video, 
unless it's built in, or you use serial.

The 0x8000 is not there when I open the device with my own code,

Is there a way to change the size of a partition.  More specifically, I
am trying to upgrade to the new kernal via Up2Date.  I am getting a
message stating that my /boot partition needs to be at least 3MB (it's
under 3 by a little bit).  Is there a way to increase the size of this
partition.  Obviously, the space will come from another partition (I
have 85% free on my /home partition).

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0210172008070.22658-100000@tpol.peak.org>

I'm building a web interface for a series of tools, written in perl,
that build data files for a PalmOS game (like Scrabble(tm)) my kids
and I designed and wrote for fun.  Users will upload text files, and a
bunch of CGI scripts will compress the files into Palm databases and
return them to the user.  I'll need to generate web pages, keep track
of state as a session progresses, and manage large files on disk.  No
database access, though.  And no interaction with other sites for
credit cards or what have you.

I've never done anything like this before, but I know perl, and there
seem to be a lot of useful modules (CGI.pm among them) for this sort
of thing.  But a friend who does web apps semi-commercially recommends
PHP -- though he doesn't know perl and so can't exactly compare the
two.

Anybody out there care to make a recommendation or suggest somewhere
to explore the question.

Perhaps I should mention that this is strictly for fun.  I want to
provide a service to people quickly and effeciently and then get back
to writing apps in C/C++.  I'm not expecting to do this
professionally.

Thanks,

I'm sure everyone here will agree that resizing partitions can be dicey,
so good backups are highly recommended, if you like your data.

You'll find partisans for every possible approach.  Each will be right, to 
some extent.

Which leads me to recommend my language of choice: Python.  Web-based apps 
are what I do and Python is just about all I use.  It is about as intuitive 
a programming language as one could ask for, and far more versitile than 
PHP.  And if you're programming for the Palm, there's even a port of Python 
available for that platform: http://pippy.sourceforge.net/ .  It's a 
particularly good language for beginners and kids.

That said, there are many here who will vouch for Perl.  Perl and Python 
are very different languages, but each has broad applicibility and 
usefulness beyond CGI.  Either would make a great choice.

Zope might be particularly worth looking into if you're putting together 
any more than a few pages.  It makes sessions and state maintenance about 
as easy as possible and does heaps more besides.  It can be extended with 
either Python or Perl, though its support for Python is far better.

IMO, YMMV, etc.

Why Python, if I may ask? The reason I ask is because I've been curious
about Python, but I was never sure whether to spend the time to learn
it or not.

I'm a Java programmer professionally. I have used (do use) a variety of
languages in my career including Perl, ASP, JavaScript, SQL, C, C++ and
now I'm doing PHP in my spare time for personal websites. So I've had no
need yet to learn Python, but I've been curious.

Reason I ask is because if the reason to use it is that it's easier then
that's not *super* compelling to me since I already know other languages.
But if it's something else, then, well... I'd be interested.

I'm sure you'll get replies saying to use <insert language here>, and
just about any language can do the job.  However, since you already know
perl, the tools you want to provide a web interface to are already
written in perl, and you want to get back to programming C/C++ apps,
don't waste your time learning the idiosyncrasies of a new language and
just use perl.

Along these lines, any pointers to the 30,000' view of all the web 
languages?  I subscribe to both Linux Magazine and Linux Journal and they 
regularly feature what is supposedly the best thing since last weeks sliced 
bread.  I usually skip those parts since I'm not a web developer (whatever 
that means anymore), but if were to learn a new language, how does one 
decide what to focus on?

Depends, I know and I can't define what my intentions are either.  But I 
can't even say what PHP is.  Is it an API for CGI?  Alternative? Etc...would 
love to see a breakdown of the big picture.  Python, Lamp, PHP, PCP, LSD, 
they all sound great, where to start?

For my money PHP is VERY handy. It's sort of syntactically similar to C,
C++ and the like so learning it won't hurt you down the road to know it.
You can use it for web programming AND for scripting on the console.
Recently I wanted to write a script in a pinch to use various console
tools in the service of donwloading a radio show in real audio. PHP fit
the bill perfectly. Quick and easy.

It won't take much of your time if you're an experienced programmer.  If 
you're pretty well-versed in the use of basic structures like linked lists 
and hash tables, Python's built-in objects will be second nature.  The 
toughest thing about it is it's *very* OO.  Everything is an object... 
functions, files, properties, methods, etc.

It's easier in a uncluttered-syntax, easy-to-read sense, not in a "for 
dummies" sense.  My #2 reason for using Python is that I can write a lot of 
functioning code quickly.  My #1 reason is that I can look at that code 6 
months later and still see how it works.

If you'd like a more thorough (and partisan) argument in favor of Python, 
you might enjoy Eric Raymond's classic rant: 
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=3882

There's also a lot of interesting Python work going on in Portland.  For 
more info on that, check out PorPIG (the Portland Python Interest Group):

At the risk of starting _Language Wars_, I can recommend Ruby
(http://www.ruby-lang.org  http://www.rubycentral.com ) for very much the
same reasons with some advantages for Perl programmers:
*Everything is an object - even regexes and numbers:
/^SomeString/.type #=> RegExp
3.times { |i| print i } #=> prints 123 (example of sending a message to a
                        # FixNum object
*Built-in classes are always open meaning that you can add methods to
built-in types.  Example:

class String
  def encrypt
    #apply some sort of encryption routine to the string
  end
end

After that all string objects will reply to the encrypt message:
myString = "This String"
myString.encrypt
(you can also add methods to single instances of a class.)
[Ooops... the String class already has a crypt method, so no need to add
an encrypt method.]

*Iterators - a very cool feature.  Python has recently added iterators,
but since they've been in Ruby from the start they tend to be well
integrated into Ruby's class libraries.

*borrows the idea of sigils from Perl, but uses them much more sparingly
and (I think) to good effect(to indicate scoping).  For example, instance
variables of a class start with '@'.  This makes it easy to spot your
instance variables in your class.  Also globals start with '$' which also
makes it easy to spot them (and get rid of them ;-)

Ruby offers the following advantages for Perl programmers:
*Easy to move from Perl -> Ruby.  I did Perl for several years.  After I
had done OO Perl for a while I decided that it was just too ugly.  I
picked up Ruby and was productive in a matter of a day or two.
*No indentation as syntax issues.  I did try Python prior to trying Ruby,
but I really couldn't get comfortable with the indentation thing.

Yeah, that can be a problem in Perl.

Anyway, I tend to find that Ruby is like a much cleaner Perl (it's been
called Perl's younger, prettier sister) and the whole system (by that I
mean the language and it's associated libraries) is just well designed and
just tends to feel like it as you work with it.  I also find that my
productivity in Ruby is greater than it was in Perl (don't get me wrong, I
really _used_ to like Perl a lot).

I really don't have any web experience, though, so I can't give you a lot
of advice in that department.  There are CGI modules and web application
frameworks available as well as a very nice XML parser (REXML).

Message-ID: <1742.192.168.1.253.1034923488.squirrel@mail.robbyrussell.com>

My primary nameserver is not allowing a slave to get transfers from it.
I just recently moved from mandrake 8.2 to 9.0 and have shorewall running.
I assume that since its getting to the /var/log/syslog that its getting
through the firewall, so I can eliminate that possibility.

this is what the slave service is giving me as a result of the transfer
failure:
Reason for Last Failure:  Error 5 returned for AXFR query

My /var/log/syslog shows:
Oct 17 23:31:52 dns named[1246]: client 204.74.104.97#36486: zone transfer
'domainName.com/IN' denied

some sniplets from /etc/named.conf:

acl secondary.com { 204.74.104.97; };

zone "domainName.com" {
        type master;
        file "/var/named/domainName.com.hosts";
        allow-transfer{ secondary.com; };
        allow-query{ any; };
};

is there anything else that I am missing to get this to work?
When I was using Mandrake 8.2 (not sure what bind version), I had no
problems like this.

My current bind version is: bind 9.2.1-4mdk

any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1. I have tried every permission gyration imaginable. I started out thinking

Hi Derek,

Thanks for your response.

I reset WinME box by performing following steps

1) Removed all old passwords

2) Removed the  "network folder" with

3) Rebooted WinME to enter new user and new password

User = AministratorME

4) Start "Home Network Wizard"

(Remark: I was not allowed to enter "SEC" as workgroup.  I must select 
"MSHOME" as workgroup.  If I entered "SEC" as workgroup, after roboot WinME 
did not appear in the network)


Hardware
1) Removed the NIC for broadband connection
2) From

Neighbour networking -> properties
removed all corresponding   NIC adapter, NetBEUI and TCP/IP

Identification changed to
workgroup = MSHOME

Rebooted WinME, new workgroup "MSHOME" found together with the old 
workgroup "SEC" in the network.  But RH8.0 (Samba serve) could not 
connected to the network nor appear there.  Neither WinME could be mounted 
from RH8.0

After playing several times including rebooting WinME the workgroup 
"MSHOME" disappeared from neighbour networking.  Reset "home networking

find WinME either with its computer name or its IP address.

I could not move any further and I am at a loss what is its cause

Sorry I don't catch your question.  I just connect a WinME box to a RH8.0 
box using Samba for files sharing.

The funny thing is, last time I succeeded using this WinME box (almost same 
settings) to connect to another Linux box (RH7.3) also using Samba for 
testing files sharing.  It worked without much setup and difficulties also 
with 2 NICs.

This is the question.  If I reboot WinME with a crossover cable connected 
to RH8.0, occasionally it is hard to boot.  If with the cable removed then 
it defeats the purpose of reboot.

I am going to connect RH80, the Samba Server, to a Win98 box with the 
target to find out whether its settings having problem, also with a 
crossover cable for connection.

I am going to reply your comment in another box, hoping that the thread can 
still be traced

Message-ID: <Pine.GSU.4.21.0210180029330.19313-100000@garcia.efn.org>

I am using an old version of Mandrake (7.0) as a web server, and I am
using postfix.  I was just able to check my logs for today, and starting
at around 7:00 this evening I started getting huge "relay access
denied" security violations.  It looks like someone is trying to use my
server as a relay spam mailer since every 15 minutes there are about 100
relay attempts which are denied by my postfix.  

I've seen this a couple of times before, but once the relay access was
denied, the flooding usually stopped within a minute.  This time, though,
it's been going on for the last 3 hours non-stop.  Here is an example of
the security violations list:

===================================================================

That's just a very tiny bit of the thousands of these I've already had in
the last few hours.  What I want to know is, why does this continue even
when the relay access is denied, and also, "TEMPORARY DNS FAILURE".. is
this a denial of service attack on my server?

I'm building a different server that I will have the latest Mandrake
running, but for now, I don't want to upgrade my current older version
because if something goes wrong, I've lost the server and I can't have it
go down for more than a day.  So for now I just want to figure out how to
stop this current relay attempt on my system.

I believe this needs to be an IP address of instead of a host/domain name.

Hi Derek, 

This is further to my late posting. 

I connected the RH8.0 (Samba Server) to a Win98 box to continue the
test.  Problem still exist 

Win98 
- Samba Server (M40G) was not found under the workgroup in networking on
Window Explorer.  
- Searching computer with its name (M40G) could not found it.  

RH8.0 
[root at localhost bin]# mount -t smbfs -o username=root,password=msliu20h
//IWILL/Shared /test 
1786: Connection to IWILL failed 
SMB connection failed 


[root at localhost /]# route -n

Discovery during tests
======================

1) If after starting RH8.0, [root at M40G /]# appeared on Console window
then M40G (Samba Server) can be found in networking under the workgroup
SEC on Window Explorer.  But clicking its icon could not visit it,
permission denied.  I have no idea how to start that.  It happened
occasionally.

2) # locate smbpassword and
# which smbpassword
Could not find smbpassword

Both Win98 and RH8.0 require password to login


/etc/smb.conf
[global]

workgroup = SEC 
guest account = nobody
encrypt passwords = yes
hosts allow = yes
security = share 

[test] 
comment = share 
path = /test
browseable = yes
read only = no
guest only = no 
guest ok = yes

Thanks

Stephen Liu

it's a reference to the acl. Isn't that how ACL works?
I actually have several IP addresses in that acl, and you should be able
to use this method when you have several domains that use several IP
addresses for transfers.

can anyone confirm that for me?

...maybe I am doing it wrong.
but i have
acl aclName {111.123.111.222;
             111.123.111.223;
             111.123.111.224;};

then i have allow-transfer{aclName;}; in the proper domain section.

I'm slow.  I'm using named/bind the same way I've used it for years.  
May be time to upgrade my knowledgebase a bit.  :-)

What about check-names; ???

I don't have this set anywhere in my /etc/named.conf
is that an issue that could cause this?

I'm going to stay out of this, except to say that when you compare
"Perl" to PHP, be sure you are comparing a Perl web application
system, like Apache::Template and Template Toolkit running under
mod_perl, not just Perl-as-CGI.

Too many people compare Perl-CGI to $web_language_X, and discover
that indeed $web_language_X is better, for some definition of better.

stonehenge.com runs Apache::Template
Slashcode (slashdot and friends) is Template Toolkit based.

It's quite a good system.  See perl.apache.org for "why mod_perl"
and tt2.org for details about Template.

Subject: [PLUG] An acroread problem
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0210180854490.30293-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I just re-installed acroread-5.0.6 but I cannot print a form from within
it. The form prints just fine from xpdf, but I cannot fill in text in that
application.

  This had worked before, and other pdf docs print just fine from this
version, but not this one-pager. Filled in or not, it sends the job to the
printer, the "processing job *" message flashes twice, then the printer goes
back to comatose mode.

  Has anyone else seen this behavior? Better yet, has anyone a solution for
it?

Thanks,

Rich

  also-notify {
    x.x.x.x;
    };
  };

Is what I have for all my domains on my primary server (names and IPs
changed to protect the innocent)...and they all work.  Bind 9 (slackware
package).  I think it's more of a push thing than a pull...

P.S.  I dunno if you use it or not but webmin has a nice BIND admin
interface...that's what I use.

  allow-transfer {

Should have included this in the other e-mail.  Here's what's on the
backup server as the slave entry for the same domain....the y.y.y.y is the
IP of the primary server...

Message-ID: <20021018092246.A18308@kippered.herring.org>

Anyone tried and/or have any opinions about this...

http://tmda.net/

It certainly looks interesting...

* MTA independent (supports qmail, Postfix, Exim, Courier, and Sendmail). 
* Integrated "blacklist" and "whitelist" functionality. 
* Optional automatic whitelisting of confirmed senders. 
* Smart auto-responding -- won't reply to a mailing list or bounce message.
  Includes auto-response rate limiting to prevent mail loops. 
* Client-side support for both Unix and non-Unix (e.g, Outlook, Eudora,
  Mozilla) mail clients.
* Package installation available for Linux, and Free/Net/OpenBSD.
* Supports vpopmail and vmailmgr.
* Flexible filtering language allowing fine-grained control over how
  incoming and outgoing mail is disposed of.
* Local mail delivery, including qmail-style Maildirs, mboxrd-format mboxes,
  program (pipe) delivery, and forward to an e-mail address.
* Supports DBM and CDB databases, including on-demand auto-regeneration of
  DB files. 
* Optional logging of incoming and outgoing messages.
* Easy customization of confirmation messages through templates.
* Use of HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Codes) for "cookie" generation
  and verification

Fill in the form with acroread
print it to a file 
open it with ghostview
print it.
ask adobe for the source to acroread so you can fix it :)

While I don't run an open mail server, I have had cases of being 
severely port probed by the same system over and over again. In these 
cases I have generally tweaked my firewall rules to quietly deny any 
and all incoming packets from the IP address of the system in question. 
This kept my syslog from filling up with unnecessary messages.

>From the looks of it is would seem that some luser is attempting to 
relay email to users at AOL through your server. It may be that 
whatever means the luser is using doesn't doing much in the way of 
error detection so the sending process appears to be completely 
oblivious to the fact that no mail is being relayed at all.

I seriously doubt that this had the intended effect, removing the folder
from the desktop doesn't reset any of the network services or protocols,
it just makes it tougher to find them.

My advise was to login to the ME box as a known linux user (like
"satimis").

Dump NetBEUI altogether, if you have any other network protocols, the
Winbox may (or may not, it is not very predictable) try to use that for
SMB communication.  Stick to just TCP/IP, double check your address.

This is because the Winbox is acting as the "Browse Master" and has
cached information about SEC.  It'll go away in a day or two.

Those are settings in samba.conf, they have an affect on the "election"
that SMB enabled computers hold every 15 min.  You need to have an OS
level of 2 or greater to have the linux box win the election (OS level
greater than 128 if your battling Win2000 server or any version of XP). 
I highly recommend setting this up, linux makes a much better "Browse
Master" than any M$ product (unless your battling a domain controller,
in which case give up, it will win in the end -- though it may take a
few months).

If you have static address assignments, then whether or not the cable is
connected really shouldn't change the boot up behavior (unless you have
a flaky NIC).  I think you've changed the ME configuration too many
times, and the OS is getting more unstable, you might want to
re-install.

This might behave a little better.  IMHO Win98 is more stable than ME,
in fact an avalanche is more stable than ME, but that is just MHO.

Bill,

  I tried printing it to a file and printing it directly. Same results as
trying to print from within acroread. Didn't try gv.

  But, it is, I believe, a problem with the form. I just re-installed
acroread-4.0.5, repointed /usr/bin/acroread to that version's wrapper
script, and the filled-in form printed just fine. So, I conclude that
there's something in a form generated under acrobat-4 that no longer works
under Acrobat-5. Isn't this the Redmond model?

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

You can set the print command in acrobat reader to something that works better,
I have mine set to "kprinter" so I can choose the printer from KDE.

The Linux installation of Acroread is a mess. They don't seem overly concerned 
with details.  I just triumphed over a new installation of 5.06 that did not 
even want to start: "Warning: charset "UTF-8" not supported, using 
"ISO8859-1".

Now I don't know if RH 8 is doing something goofy, or Adobe, and I'm getting 
to the point where having to track down and fix these kinds of issues is a 
seriously irritating waste of time. I found the fix, the acroread script must 
be edited thusly, add:

LANG=en_US
 export LANG

to the beginning of the script.

I also had a similar printing problem- Acroread was trying to call up a 
printing subsystem that was not installed. Take a good look at the printer 
dialogue when it comes up, maybe it will be that simple.

Maybe.

The digest form of lists can be configured to send out a digest whenever
X number of messages or Y number of bytes of message are queued up. 

When the size of the digest-to-be passes the threshold a digest is sent out.

This lightens the burst load on the server and the reader.

Ralph,

  In CUPS I have redefined the laser jet from laser5 to both laser5_ps and
laser5_non_ps. The former prints duplex and the latter prints simplex. I
specified laser5_ps in both acroread-4 and acroread-5. It worked only with
the former.

Thanks,

Rich

  Thanks for passing the pointer, Carla. I'll look at the wrapper script.

  Both versions of acroread show /usr/bin/lpr in the print command box. That
used to work by itself, but now it works -- only in version 4 -- when I
specify the specific printer despite having CUPS see it as the default.

  Part of my problem _may_ be CUPS related. They changed things in the
newest version and some of my applications don't recognize when the printer
has paper in the manual feed (Tray 1). PITA.

  It used to all work before everyone tried to make linux simple for the
digitally-challenged (or, synaptically-challenged if you perfer).

I am installing bind 8 on RH 7.3 for a school assignment.
Before doing so I rpm'd away bind 9 and "caching nameserver" so I would
have a fresh go at it. Unfortunately, when I run "make install" I am
erroring. I am not able to troubleshoot the error, your input would be
greatly appreciated. Did I remove some necessary info when I got rid of
bind 9?

So as not to junk up your email I posted the session output here:

A person on another list was having difficulties getting Samba to work on RH
8.0. It turned out the issue was that he had iptables blocking the ports needed
by Samba. I don't know if this was a default or if he configured the rules this
way.

Subject: [PLUG] Reviews of RedHat 8.0 - is it worth $150?
Message-ID: <3DB06CCD.9E85DDDD@gisnet.com>

After fighting all day trying to install Red Hat 7.1 on a brand
new Athlon XP1800 and having IDE bus problems (drivers don't seem
to work), we were wondering if it would be worth just snagging
the $150 RedHat Professional 8.0 CD set from CompUSA (y'know
support the good guys and have it NOW rather than slooowly
teasing off the FTP archives.)

We do want server capability, but are the improvements worth the
price? Is it going to install on this hardware anyway? Any
caveats about doing this that anyone here is aware of?

If you want my opinion, do NOT install anything from RH on a .0 release. 
  History has shown that they're usually horribly broken, unstable and 
generally unusable unless you *like* living on the bleeding edge.

If you're stuck on Redhat, I'd suggest going with 7.3, since it's on the 
third (fourth?) iteration, it should be more mature and stable.

However, if you're installing a server system, why go with Redhat at 
all?  IMHO, Redhat and Mandrake are the 'eye candy' distributions.  They 
specifically tweak the system to make it look as pretty as possible on 
the desktop.  Who cares if you have a pretty desktop on a server?  All 
three of my server-type systems run headless, so no need for X or any 
other desktop-related items.  That said, I would suggest Debian, simply 
because it is much easier to keep on top of updates - which, on a 
headless server system, is key.

Also - you might try linux googling for 'Athlon IDE problem', perhaps 
adding your chipset version in there for good measure.  Chances are, 
someone, somewhere, has run into the same problem and has posted a fix 
for it on the web.  I was having a horrible time putting a 2940U2W into 
my AMD/VIA KT133 system until I found out that ONE bios setting caused 
the whole thing.  After I flipped the bit on that setting, it worked 
flawlessly.

I personally wouldn't patronize either RH or CompUSA.  Find a local 
retailer that sells Linux CD's for cheap, and then donate directly to 
your favorite distribution.

But that's just me.

Most folks on this list have lots 'o CDs of different distros, many just 
for the asking. If you show up at the Linux Clinic at Riverdale High 
tomorrow, I can give you RH 8.0 or 7.3 CDs. PLus, you'd have people on 
hand to help you troubleshoot.

It's Free Software. Try-before-you-buy is not only legal, but

It depends on how you'll be deploying the box. If you're mostly 
interested in providing network services (http, dns, etc), I'd stick 
with Red Hat 7.3 (and its subsequent updates).

If this will be someone's desktop machine, and you're interested in 
the latest GNOME and KDE releases, then 8.0 offers a better solution.

A couple things worth knowing about 8.0:

* it ships with gcc 3.2, which produces binaries that are incompatible 
  with prior gcc dynamic libaries

* it ships with Apache 2.x, which may or may not be what you want

Never used it.

Although I had heard that you have to pay a monthly fee to become a 
'preferred' customer, so that you are guaranteed updates *when* they 
come out.  So if you don't pay, and the servers are busy, you are SOL.

They may have changed that policy since I heard that.  I don't know.

  Nope. Same ol' policy.

  I'm running apt-rpm. Eventually most of the updates make it to the
tuxfamily.org repositories. Those that don't, I get from rpmfind.net.

One.

Regarding the pricing, a Red Hat Network subscription is 60 bucks a
machine, I believe.  There is some kind of premium service that costs
more if you want all the bells and whistles.

The company I just started working for has been using up2date to keep
a handful of Linux boxes running happily w/ no linux guru on staff and
 just the cheapo subscription.  I was suprised to see how well it works.

Well, "up2date -u" to update everything in one go sounds pretty
easy, but it failed for me because some configuration file was
changed outside of rpm's control. Must have been the custom
install I did of PHP a while ago. Anyway, I put the job off until
later when I had more time to deal with that. Then RedHat 8.0 was
released the next day. Freeloaders like me were then barred from
using up2date due to "high volume" on the Red Hat site. You need
to pay them $60 per system to get preferred treatment. I still
can't get in today. So from my experience, don't depend on
up2date to keep your system safe from hackers. By the time you
finally get your update, the robo hackers will have screwed,
blued, and tattooed your machine to their infinite delight.

OTH, if you MUST stay on top of these things for commercial
reasons, then expect to pay for the convenience. I don't like it,
but I don't expect RedHat to do everything for free. But at least
if you haven't paid for the service, you can get an instant
refund!

i think i finally tracked down the problem to the firewall.
/etc/named.conf was squeaky clean.

# iptables -A INPUT -p udp --sport 53

seemed to allow my zone transfers to work.
is this secure to open up?

I'm running rpm-update on a couple dozen machines at work and a 
couple more at home:

  http://www.kleemann.org/rpm-update/

You can point it at a variety of mirror sites (I like
mirrors.kernel.org, but opnsrc.support.compaq.com is a good backup). 
I've got a daily cron job that runs it in "tell me what's available 
for download, but don't actually download anything" mode:

  35   5   *   *   *    USER=$LOGNAME /usr/bin/rpm-update -d -n

Then I

  # download the updates
  rpm-update -d
  # find out what needs to be installed on any given local host
  rpm-update -r
  # hand-install touchy packages like kernel-* or rpm-*
  # and then let rpm-update handle the mass installations
  rpm-update -i
  # and, occasionally, clear out obsolete packages

Thanks for all the quick advice. We should have researched it
more. The guy whose machines needed the install on (Athlon xp
1800 and HP Pentium 4) couldn't wait and went out and got the RH
8.0. It also failed to install on either machine as well. Wahoo.
There's something about these new machines that doesn't like
Linux. He suspects something to do with the IDE drivers, but we
still don't know. Probably they have a Microsoft XP-friendly
chipset (muhaha.)

So the lesson learned is to be wary of the latest equipment; it
might not work.

P.S. I wish I could get to your Linux Clinic (I could bring along
a couple of stumpers for the experts), but I live far away and
over the mountains. But thanks again for all the help so far!

This may start a flame war and I can't say that I would be sad about that. 

But apt is free, updated quickly, and fast. :)Really I can't think of a reason to use RH for anything anymore.

Well, "up2date -u" to update everything in one go sounds pretty
easy, but it failed for me because some configuration file was
changed outside of rpm's control. Must have been the custom
install I did of PHP a while ago. Anyway, I put the job off until
later when I had more time to deal with that. Then RedHat 8.0 was
released the next day. Freeloaders like me were then barred from
using up2date due to "high volume" on the Red Hat site. You need
to pay them $60 per system to get preferred treatment. I still
can't get in today. So from my experience, don't depend on
up2date to keep your system safe from hackers. By the time you
finally get your update, the robo hackers will have screwed,
blued, and tattooed your machine to their infinite delight.

OTH, if you MUST stay on top of these things for commercial
reasons, then expect to pay for the convenience. I don't like it,
but I don't expect RedHat to do everything for free. But at least
if you haven't paid for the service, you can get an instant
refund!

I'd be interested to find out if one of the Debian bf2.4 kernels would
boot that sucker.  Look for the Woody NetInstall CD image (it isn't very
big), it will give you 4 different choices of kernels to try.

Just another $0.02

Howdy,

Any body have a handy procmail recipe for folks that match the 'no

I get alot of email from folks who can't type, and I'd like to have
something that will send back to the sender an automated message,

Hi Russell,

Sorry.  That is not my case.

I stopped ipchains and iptables before starting Samba   Also I restarted
Samba and network after having made changes to smb.conf and/or network

Thanks

Boy, I don't know. Depends on if Red Hat is your bag. I tried it and stuck
with SuSE, which costs half as much.

Here's a little script to make the up2date work for you automatically.
This script keeps issuing the up2date command until it does not give
an error.  It could fill up your system with processes or files.  But,
most of the time it just gets the rpms.



########################Cut here################################
#!/usr/bin/perl
#

my ( $OUTPUT );
print $OUTPUT = `up2date-nox -u`;
if ( $OUTPUT =~ /Error*/ )

   print ".";
   `./uptodate.pl`;
}

Do you have specifics on the MB or model of the HP. Do you also know how the
install failed? I've had a few GUI installs not work but usually I can get a
console install to work when that happens.

Hmm same here.  I won a copy of SuSE 5.0 or something roughly that old in a 
raffle at a Linux user group meeting.  Stuck with it ever since then.  The 
online update stuff has worked quite well (and I don't have to pay a fee 
for access).  SuSE's got several mirrors that are automatically downloaded 
into the update app.

I've never had any problems with getting things with the online update.  
Sometimes the speeds are slow (I managed to do an update the day that SuSE 
8.1 was released), but I got everything.  I didn't even know that RH cost 
money for guaranteed access.  That would have made me run in the other 
direction if I hadn't already been a SuSE fan.  I hope that SuSE doesn't 
start doing that.

Best,
Kyle

As a longtime SuSE user that started with SuSE 5.2 I would probably be 
running towards Debian if SuSE changes their policy. I have bought 
nearly every boxed set version of SuSE Linux since I started with 5.2 
so I'm not on any sort of free ride with SuSE Linux either.

Hi All,

Well... My mother sent me a virus. OK, I tries to explain to her not to open files with more than 1 dot, but it was from a friend that said they could not open the file, so....

I'm trying to identify which virus it is so I can try to clean up her computer. Subject line was "Hello!"
A file was simply attached - Budget.xsl.scr. The budget spreadsheet is an actual file of hers so the virus picked it up and attached itself then went through her address book and sent it out.

Her components are: Opera 6.1 for all browsing, and Eudora Pro 4.3 for her mail. Most e-mail virus warnings I've seen posted are due to the wonderful Microsoft Outlook products, so I'm not sure which virus this is.

Any help or direction to look would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Steve Coffman

You could try scanning her computer using http://housecall.antivirus.com
** note ** read carefully, you do not have to register.
Then buy her a copy of your least hated AV product.

You can find plenty of "system" chassis at this size too. Usually won't 
do any cards though. All the peripherals need to be on the mb.

It'll hold the main board, and then do 1 to 3 expansion cards (depending 
on the chassis and riser card). 2U isn't high enough to plug the cards 
directly into the mb.

Minimum size for using the expansion card slots vertically.

  I've decided to put off lobbying for an Oregon anti-spam law until after
the elections. No sense lobbying someone who may not be in a position to
help. Depending on who wins, I think that we can get 3-4 sponsors of an
anti-spamming law; house and senate.

  What encourages me is the article in today's Oregonian reporting that
Washington has successfully procecuted its first spammer under its law. This
is a 28-year-old from Salem who sent about 300,000 spam mails soliciting
sales of his $40 book on how to make money on the Internet. Under Washington
law, each incident can result in a fine of $20,000 plus the cost of
procecution. The judge dropped the conviction to a single incident and
lopped a third off the restitution of costs. The defendent now owes the
state of Washington $96,000.

  With precedent set across the river, it will be easier to garner support
among the legislators. I look forward to getting gowing on this next month.

Hmm same here.  I won a copy of SuSE 5.0 or something roughly that old
in a 
raffle at a Linux user group meeting.  Stuck with it ever since then.
The 
online update stuff has worked quite well (and I don't have to pay a fee

for access).  SuSE's got several mirrors that are automatically
downloaded 
into the update app.

I've never had any problems with getting things with the online update.

Sometimes the speeds are slow (I managed to do an update the day that
SuSE 
8.1 was released), but I got everything.  I didn't even know that RH
cost 
money for guaranteed access.  That would have made me run in the other 
direction if I hadn't already been a SuSE fan.  I hope that SuSE doesn't

start doing that.

Best,
Kyle

Bruce,

You mean "addressee unknown"? Like this?


## capture the address that caused delivery
:0
* ^X-Envelope-To: \/.*
{
	ENVELOPE_TO="$MATCH"
}

# bounce email not to me
:0
* ! ENVELOPE_TO ?? ^brucek at kingkon.com$
{
    # EX_NOUSER = 67 from sysexits.h
    EXITCODE = 67
    :0
    /dev/null
}


This assumes, of course, that your MTA/MDA is configured to add the
X-Envelope-To: header so that you can reconcile Bcc's, etc.

hth,
Sandy

p.s.    You may want to replace the /dev/null action with a delivery to a
        spam folder until you're content it's working.

So what happens to the money he pays the State of Washington?  And what
would you suggest for similar actions in Oregon - where does the money go.

Probably more suitable for "plug-talk", but I'm not a moderator.

Hmm, I suppose it would be theoretically possible. I've tended to alternate 
between upgrading and reinstalling.  I generally buy each version of SuSE 
Pro.  However, all the RPMs are available for download.  They just aren't 
organized with ISO images etc.

I've thought about mirroring all the RPMs locally, but with 8.0, I was able 
to just copy the CDs all to my drive and then twiddle a couple of things 
to point YaST there and haven't needed to load the CDs since.  Very handy.  
Hopefully 8.1's redone RPM handling supports this better. 

I think that SuSE doesn't officially support anything before about 7.0 now.  
So, you'd have to figure out how to manually upgrade to 7.0 and then 
probably do it one version at a time after that.  Unless you time is free, 
I'd suggest just buying the CDs :-)

Best,
Kyle

I think it was just this past summer when SuSE stopped supporting 6.4 
although they did release an OpenSSH patch for it a few months back 
because it was a rather severe problem. I finally retired my old SuSE 
6.4 gateway/firewall when they discontinued support for it. 

The system was a minimal install on a small hard drive and I was pushing 
the limits of how many upgrades I could go through without the root 
filesystem running out of space. The system was pretty close to full 
after the upgrade from 6.3 to 6.4 so I just left the system alone and 
only installed the patches SuSE made available from time to time for 
it.

That was on /. today. The defendent is appealing on the grounds that he
feels that some law involving protection of interstate commerce is being
violated or some such. I say hang him, or do as my .procmailrc would do -
send him to /dev/null. :-)

Sounds like a former "tech" at my work. He seemed to believe that any expansion card newer than ISA was hot swappable. On reflection, he was able to get the hardware he wanted for his own workstation, maybe he was less stupid, and more sneaky than I thought...

    May I chime in with something I have considered for a while?  Oregon
already has a 'no spam' law for telephones, called the oregon 'no-call' law
www.ornocall.com, where you can be put on a list they are required to check
before making a call to anyone in oregon.  It makes solictications illegal,
with a few cevats (covering the obvious, like prior buisness relationships,
and non-profit organizations).
    We could campaign for a no email-spam law and win.  And then campaign
for a no snail-mail spam law and win.  And we could campaign for laws
against sticking flyers on your door, and in your car windshield wiper.  And
then we could campaign again when television ads go digital and are targeted
directly at individual viwers.  And 50 years in the future when the next
communications medium goes big (telepathic advertising? *shudders*).  And we
could keep fighting every single step of the way.  But perhaps there is a
better solution.
    What I want is a 'no direct contact for buisness purposes without prior
consent' law.  It would make ANY directly targeted advertising illegal
unless that buisness has prior consent, either in writen form, or the prior
buisness thing from ornocall.com.  The details are fuzzy, but think of the
advantage.  If a law such as this had been passes when comsumers got fed up
with cataloges and junk mail at thier door, and soliticors on the phone,
then it would have automatically applied to the unforseen format of 'email'.
We could be the first state with a 'no harassment of consumers' law.  How
cool would that be?

Hi Tony,

There is no such an item in the CMOS of the motherboad.  I have been 
suffering this defect ever since I ran RH7.3.  I can power off manually 
without disturbance to the PC.  It is only inconvenient.

Thanks

Stephen

As the old saw goes, be careful what you wish for.

In the first and second quarters of 2002, the US Postal Service had
revenues of approx. $31 billion. Of that, $7.3 billion (23%) was from
"Standard Mail," which is primarily advertising.

I know a number of people who've spent time in Europe who will tell
you that our postal service is so much cheaper and more dependable 
than what you find in other countries.

If we vote to ban roughly 25% of the USPS's income, then postage
becomes a *lot* more expensive for consumers.

I'm a big fan of the Internet and digital information transfers, but 
I'm nowhere near comfortable enough with electronic security to forego 
completely a signature sent via snail mail.

For me, I'd rather ignore the junk mail that subsidizes the USPS than 
face much higher rates.

YMMV, of course.

Subject: [PLUG] USB hard drive with Linux?
Message-ID: <32795.209.210.31.3.1035128892.squirrel@webmail.woo-hoo.com>

Compusa is selling a 40GB USB2.0/1.1 external hard drive for
about $50 after rebates.  This price is a lot lower than say
a ZIP drive and tremendously higher capacity.  I bought one
and am trying to get it to work with RH7.2.  Could use some
help understanding Linux & USB.
I _think_ that it is being recognized and drivers being
loaded from the following output:
[root at sparky root]# cat /proc/bus/usb/devices
<snip>
T:  Bus=01 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=01 Cnt=02 Dev#=  3 Spd=12  MxCh= 0

E:  Ad=83(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS=   2 Ivl=32ms
[root at sparky root]#

According to this link, the driver "usb-storage" will create
the drive as /dev/sda (assuming no other SCSI devices are
installed):
http://www.linux-usb.org/USB-guide/x498.html


I presume the first task on order is to fdisk it and make a
partition.  This seemed to go well and the partition I created
on /dev/sda1 persists across reboots.

Wouldn't the next task be to create a filesystem on /dev/sda1?
I tried /sbin/mke2fs /dev/sda1 and it runs for awhile, gets to
the part about making inodes and hangs at about 577/1024.  Thought
I wasn't patient enough so I let it run overnight and it didn't
get any further.

Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.  I have read about
some usbide drivers but don't understand when or whether these
are needed, given the output of cat /proc/bus/usb/devices above
(doesn't that mean I already have drivers loaded?)
http://bravin.home.cern.ch/bravin/usbide/usbide.html

Does it stand to reason that if fdisk is working fine, that I
can create a partition which fdisk can read later, that all the
drivers are working correctly and it is now just a matter of
correctly creating a file system & mounting?

Thanks!

Seems to me USPS has managed to achieve higher rates all on their own.  And 
that junk mail is subsidized *by* us, it's not a subsidy *to* us.

On the other hand, if we did away with the legal monopoly USPS enjoys, we 
might actually see rates decline once FedEx and UPS entered the market.

Of course, if we de-monopolized the mail system, how long would it be 
before MS took over and had us all buying Passport-enabled postage 
chips?  It could be the next great virus vector. :-)

Everything you did is what I did. I've tried a similar setup and finally
switched to a firewire drive. I can run a cdrom from the USB box fine but a
hard drive will time out on large file operations. I did get the drive to
format but was unable to copy much to it without the drive locking up.

I tried the box in a USB 2.0 and USB 1.1 port on the Linux with the same
results. I couldn't get the box to work on a Win2k, with USB 1.1, box either. 

Thank you
Russell

Try passing

at the boot prompt.

If that works then append it to your boot loader.

Yeah, making it work would take a lot of changes I'm sure, and I *know* it
would have a great impact on the economy.  Imagine buinsnesses that had to
sell actuall products.

There would be some casualties of course.  On the email ban you might argue
the big telcos would lose out on all the asian spam overseas traffic.  I'm
willing to pay more for postage in return for less junk mail.  Alternatively
you could agree to recieve junkmail in return for lower rate postage.  Would
you do it?  I'm sure I wouldn't, but then I don't send much snail mail.

This will probably get better over time, right?

Like I said above, what about an agreement where they send you junk, and you
get cut rates?  That makes it your choice.  Remeber the www.ornocall.com
list is completely optional.  Actually the majority of oregonions aren't on
it.  A similar, but more general list, would still be opt in probably.

I'm not sure about it flying politically, but can't we go over thier heads
in this case?  Get enough signatures and it goes on the ballot, no questions
asked?  Its certainly something I would campaign for.  Of course it requires
not a small amount of refactoring, and research, as well as some pretty
detailed exceptions.  Who says we can't? :)  I mostly wanted to get the idea
out there for feedback.  Thanks a lot for the ideas!

How did the firewire drive work?  I have a firewire cd burner and hard
drive (on a windows machine).  I'd like to think that when I switch that
computer over to linux, those firewire devices will continue to work.

I've always wondered about that. In that "other" OS, I can have a little
icon with all the possible resolutions for my screen, and can switch
between them fairly easily. It comes in handy when designing web pages.
Sure, I like to work in 1024 x 768, but how does that page look in 640 x
480, or 800 x 600? My laptop supports 800 x 600, but not 1024 x 768, my
wife doesn't want 1024 x 768, and my mother-in-law wants 640 x 480
because it's easier to see. Family web pages have to look good for all
the family.

I'm looking forward to trying that out when it becomes available.

Subject: [PLUG] Debian X configuration on Thinkpad
Message-ID: <3DB351BA.9653951D@attbi.com>

At yesterday's clinic I was trying to find out why my X console came on
dim when I switched back to it after switching to a text console. (The X
console came on at normal brightness when X first started up.) There
weren't any Debian gurus there while I was, and I had to leave early, so
we were unable to resolve the problem. But Dan (I think it was Dan) gave
me some ideas of where to look. We tried running xf86cfg, but couldn't
get the buttons to respond. I decided to have a look at XF86Config-4 to
see what I could learn. Well, the first think I learned was that Debian
has an X Configuration tool. So, I ran dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86,
as instructed and walked through the various configuration options.

The important thing that I had to change was what I told the
configuration program I had for a video device. When I first installed
the OS, I had chosen vega, since I didn't know any better. Today, I did
some google searching and found a page with some more details:

http://www.linuxcare.com/labs/certs/pad390x-suse64-sys.epl

>From that, I learned that I should be using NeoMagic instead of vega.
Now, when I switch from the X console to a text console and back again,
the X console is at normal brightness.

So thanks, Dan, for pointing me in a direction that led me to the
solution.

Works well expect hotplug, I'm not using an official suse 8.1 and
http://www.suse.de/en/private/products/suse_linux/i386/new_features.html 
claims Hardware: Hotplug support for USB2 and Firewire so I came up with a
script to load the modules and mount the drive, so I'm happy with the firewire.
I've copied my running 8.0 system to it, repartitioned the boot drive,
installed a 8.1 beta wiping everything out, and then copied everything back. I
think the total I moved was 15G both ways.

Having an external USB ide CDRW is alot easier as the CDRW is reckonized as
SCSI without having to set up ide-scsi and sg.	Hotplug will set it up for you.
I was only able to burn an iso image at 12X max with USB, both 2.0 and 1.1,
with a 24x and 48x burner. ( I can burn a 670M iso in 144 sec with the 48x via
the IDE interface ). I can't remember what I got with the CDRW in the firewire
box. I got tired of booting from floppy and moved the CDRW back into the case.
Although the MB I have supports booting from an USB CD, I was never able to do
so. I updated the MB BIOS to the latest when I was playing with this, but got
no joy.

The price for an external USB at ENU have come down by about 1/4 since I bought
my external case and the deals on cheap CDRW, got the 48x for $29.95, make a do
it yourself external fall under my $100 per part budget, 59.95 + $29.95 =
$89.90. The firewire enclosures are still the about the same at $79.95.  

Thank you

Due, mostly, to the decline in volume. Less volume makes the system less 
efficient, and, in turn, cost more.

It's the inverse of why memory is so cheap these days.

Regardless, we still have the least expensive postal service in the 
world. I remember a time when we had the best telephone system in the 
world. We "de-monopolized" it, and it went to shit.

How do you figure? The USPS doesn't get one penny of taxes. It's 
supported entirely by postage fees.

The only monopoly the USPS "enjoys" is sending first class mail. UPS, 
FedEx, Airborne, all of them, are able to move anything else. Even then, 
you can send correspondence through FedEx, they even call it a letter.

You want FedEx et al to pick up at your doorstep daily? And just how 
inefficient do we have to make it?

 From what I understand, the big package movers don't want the letter 
business.

Subject: [PLUG] mail handling agents for users
Message-ID: <2437.216.99.218.67.1035169955.squirrel@sautez.dhs.org>

I have a domain that I manage for another and would like to give them
ability to decide how their mail to handled.  I'm allowing two mail boxes
on the server and all mail is being sent to one account on the server.

Thus:

user1
user2

postfix alias file:
@domain.com   user1

I had a promail file setup such they can do the follow:

:0:
  * ^TO_joeuser at domain\.com
  ! user2 at localhost


then the user1 could forward all the email to the other user on the same
machine.  The problem seems that the mail is not all going to that user. 
User2 has signed up for some maillist and the mailer is sending them BBC
or some other hidden way.

Is there a way that I can use procmail or some other tool that the user
could alter in his home directory to decide which mail goes where?

I know that I can put an entry in the postfix user alias file and now have
to temporary resolve the issue but would like the user of the domain to be
able to handle his email.

Thanks for any suggestions.

Josh

I think that if the ISPs --all the way up the line to the one that
is the North American connection to the Mother of All Spam Pipes
(the Korean Konnection)-- could be tasked with either charging for
spam or blocking it or paying us for it themselves, then most spam
would disappear.

The reason we have so much spam is that there is practically no cost
for the spammers. If we inspire or compel ISPs to charge a fee from
their upstream providers or spammers directly for spam sent into the
'net, I imagine we see an end to the junk. The fee doesn't have to
be large; even a 20 cent fee per 100 recipients would add up and
provide ISPs with some extra income that could possibly translate
into 25% less cost to us in user fees.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0210210650430.20067-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Yesterday morning someone from Japan attempted to crack our network via
ssh. The attempt was rejected and I want to report this to the originating
domain. However, I'm having a problem getting the outgoing message past my
postfix spam filters.

  The domain is "nic.ad.jp", and the problem is with the ".ad." portion.
Postfix sees this as "any character, followed by the letters 'ad', followed
by any character". This matches " addresses", " advertisement", and so on.
It's an interesting conundrom.

  I've seen ".ac.<country_code>" for academic domains, but I've not before
encountered an "ad". I suppose this is for the Network Administrative Center
in Japan, where I thought I should report this. I'll try the specific
domain, digirh.com, and that should go through.

  But, what does one do with an address that is so generic that it matches
spam filters as a regex when it's part of the domain name?

Thanks,

Rich

I'm guessing you have out-going SPAM tests.  The major pain method would
be to connect directly to their mail server server (SMTP port) and deliver
the message directly using telnet.  Some of the mail clients for browsers 
did/do this.
   A special program to send mail by-passing the local SMTP server would
be a neat thing.  Kind of like the spammers do (??? :-) but for us white
hats.

Xine libraries installation went all right, without any problems.
Xine user interface ui-xine went through configuration phase without
problems but it chocked on compilation make phase.
It gave me errors related to Imlib-light directory files which are a
part of ui-xine tarball.
Could somebody please share his/her positive experience

Thanks in advance.

I seem to recall that the Washington spam law makes it relatively easy
for private individuals to be awarded damages from spammers. I would
really like to see a proposed Oregon law do the same so that we do have
to wait for the Oregon state attorney general to decide that a spammer
is egregious enough to persue.

Alex,

  I may be slightly off on the details, but while the domain name, from and
to may be spoofed, the originating IP address can be found. Sometimes some
of those are spoofed, too, but there's enough info to track it back down
using whois, dig, nslookup (deprecated), host and other standard tools.

Ken,

  The time and effort involved. Candidly, I rarely report cracking attempts
from Asia because I assume from the number of open relays there that they
just don't care.

Well, it means that ISP's or government should spend some 
forensic resources to investigate each spam message if anti-spam 
law is adopted.
Who will pay for these procedures? Legiment users?
What if spam servers located overseas? 
Who will they charge then - domain owners or foreign governments?
The problem as I envision it is in anchient mail protocol standards
itself. There is no non-spoofable hard links or pointers to the real
host from which message was sent. What if mail servers just refuse to
accept/deliver mail messages without proper headers with clear
authentication. Then spam will vanish on its own. 
I'm just dreaming about it while deleting >200 spam messages 
I'm getting every day.

Alex,

  I suspect that ISPs will spend no more than they now do on their abuse
teams and the additional hardware and bandwidth needed to move spam around
the 'Net.

  The spam generators.

  What do you do now if you have a violation of US/state statute by a
foreign entity?

  Write better filters. I keep working on it which is why I sometimes
totally trash the mail system here and reject every incoming and outgoing
mail. Fixing the problem is not what I want to be doing at 6 am. :-) But,
other than last evening's major no-no, I'm getting much better at it. I even
understand what I'm doing -- some of the time.

If you are using Pine you should be OK. AFAIK there are no email type viri that have Pine as a vector and I should know. What is it that you are worried about?

Preston,

  There are a few advertised in Linux Journal. AFAIK, they all work in front
of the MTA, not back with the MUA or with fetchmail.

  If you're using fetchmail then your ISP should be filtering the virul
messages. Send them a message and ask what they're doing about the problem.
You can probably craft procmail recipes or use spamassassin (or one of the
other context analyzers) on your end.

F-Prot for Linux is free, though not open source.  The updates are
frequent and readily available.  However, as you would expect from a free
product, you're on your own to figure out how to update the files
automatically should you so desire.  (You just need to FTP them and
extract...)

You would need to set up procmail to run the messages through the scanner.  
I generally don't bother since Klez (the virus I see the most often)
doesn't infect *NIX variants running Pine.  ;-)

>Less volume makes the system less efficient, and, in turn, cost more.

Perhaps.  Or the inefficiency might come from the other business ventures 
they're plodding in to.  USPS, a *federal agency*, is one of the largest 
advertisers in the US.  Why is it necessary to advertise a service that you 
hold a legally granted monopoly for?  Because they are actively branching 
out into other domains, and that is simply not what they are good at, nor 
what they have been created to do.

Yes, the USPS is funded through our postage.  Bulk rates are significantly 
cheaper than other kinds of delivery.  There may be *some* efficiency to 
bulk mail, in that it sorts faster or is pre-sorted.  But the real expense, 
delivery, presents few economies of scale.  Every time we pay postage, 
we're paying not only for the delivery of *our* mail but for the delivery 
of *junk* mail.


>The only monopoly the USPS "enjoys" is sending first class mail. UPS, 
>FedEx, Airborne, all of them, are able to move anything else. Even then,

That little, insignificant monopoly is a $60+ billion business.

>You want FedEx et al to pick up at your doorstep daily?

Why not?  Seems like they're here daily anyway.   :-)

More to the point, who says that a competitor would try to do exactly the 
same thing?  The value of competitors is that they will try *different* 
things.   Seems to me that one of the big cost factors in the USPS model is 
that they are burdened with the expectation of daily home visits to every 
address in the country.  Talk about inefficiency!  Eliminate the bulk mail 
and the daily at-home pick-up and you've got a far cheaper model to work 
with.

Would it really be such a bad thing if first class delivery happened only 
three times a week or if you had to put your mail in the box at the corner 
if you needed same-day pickup?  There's *lots* of room for innovation, but 
the USPS won't be able to make it fly... only a private competitor will.


> From what I understand, the big package movers don't want the letter 
> business.

They don't want the "replicate the USPS business model" business.  If they 
were allowed to deliver first class mail, they'd find a better way of doing 
it.  There are tens of billions at stake, of course they want a piece of 
that business.  They just don't want to play be the same rules as the post 
office and I don't blame them... the USPS doesn't want to play by those 
rules either.  Problem is, they're stuck with them.

The problem here is not that all government agencies or monopolies are evil 
or inefficient.  It's that when you ask customers to declare their 
requirements up front, they usually over-specify... when you offer a range 
of services at varying prices, *then* they show what they'll really pay for.

The USPS is in much the same problem as the Apple Newton (trying 
desperately to make this a little on topic).  When Apple did their 
research, what they heard was that handwriting recognition would have to be 
a *key* component of any PDA device.  And they did it, and nobody bought 
it.  What Palm proved was that focus groups are often misleading... making 
a product that worked more reliably and cheaply by *not* giving customers 
handwriting recognition proved to be a much more successful proposition.

We constantly tell the USPS that daily home visits are at the very heart of 
our most basic expectations.  We endow that expectation with the force of a 
legal mandate. But I suspect that if daily visits were put side-by-side 
with a service offered a different model, we would see what people are 
actually willing to pay for pretty quickly.

Subject: [PLUG] Using Mozilla for e-mail
Message-ID: <3DB446ED.2030301@attbi.com>

I'm trying to use Mozilla as an e-mail client on my laptop. The window 
for adding a new card to the address book has no scroll bar, and is 
taller than 600 pixels. Unfortunately, the control buttons for 
performing the addition are at the bottom of the window. I have looked 
for a setting in preferences, but don't find anything that will let me 
change the size of the window, or in some other way allow me to see 
everything displayed in it.

Is this because someone decided that 1024 x 768 is what "everyone" 
should be using, or am I missing something?

I'll be trying other e-mail tools, but since I already know how Netscape 
works, I thought it would be easier to stick with the familiar for the 
time being.

Doesn't this have a spell checker?

This is not true. The USPS receives lots of our tax money. Among
other things, it pays for the bulk mail discounts that non-profit

I don't know. But rather than give up and say it can't be done,
it would be more useful to consider how it *can* be done. It
would probably require a change in the e-mail protocol that would
treat an unknown message's status from "trusted until proven to
be spam" to "not trusted until proven legitimate." Spammers do it
for the money, so all we have to do is make it more expensive for
them to operate. Spammers are using our resources without paying
us, either directly or through lower access costs for us. By all
definitions they are stealing from us. 

I say put the squeeze on ISPs to figure something out because the
higher up the pipe you go the more concentrated the spam load is
with a better economy of scale in which to develop and implement
anti-spam techniques.

But I do know that if each us tries to independently filter spam
on the extreme downstream end, we will not ever be able to bring
enough concentration of pressure to bear on these spamming
parasites to wipe them off the face of the earth. They will
continue to improve their delivery throughput (because without
checks, that's the way the economic equation goes) and we will
all end up spending all our time trying to design better spam
filters and seeing our systems performance degrade under what
will eventually amount to a spam-fueled DDoS attack. I don't want
to have to spend all my time and money garrisoning and defending
a fortress; I want to have some fun with the internet too!

I'm not clear on what you're asking for, Ed. If you want to manipulate
the text line for an xterm or rxvt window, the Bash-Prompt-HOWTO
has a lot of good ideas for getting past the ``xterm -T 'Title of Window'"
stage.

If there is nothing in Gnome -- or its window managers -- that support
the equivalent of the -T flag, then I have one more reason to
dislike Gnome.

I'm starting to use EMACS after not seeing it for about 20 years. I was
just getting into it at Prime Computer when I left there for Apollo, and
Apollo didn't have EMACS at the time. I read somewhere about using EMACS
to handle e-mail, so I suspect I'll move in that direction.

  An article in yesterday's "Oregonian" noted that a company is tryign to do
this. They have "legitimate" mass mailers post a bond ($100,000 was the
figure mentioned) against spamming. If they violate the trust, they lose
part of their money, directly proportional to the number of complaints
received.

  I didn't pay too much attention to the details because this is a
for-profit operation and the implication is that if we peons want to make
use of the trust certification we'll have to pay for it.

  I'd rather push for a state-wide law and get folks enforcing it. Cheaper
on my end.

For the love of all that is good in the universe please don't. For text based email either Pine or Mutt. I like Mutt because at least under Debian it integrates *very* nicely with everything else I want. Emacs makes a horrible mail client and is not so hot as a browser and IMO does not even do the test editing thing so well.

Problems like this is what prompted me to start using blackbox as a
window manager.  If you grab any border, except at the lower corners,
you can move the window anywhere.  Very handy for recovering from the
full screen mode of mozilla, too.

Different window managers behave differently, some have this
functionality, others don't.

One solution I've found is to use a "small screen" window manager like 
'ion' or 'matchbox', as they at least force the window to fit within the 
current screen dimensions. Unfortunately, if the application hard-codes 
the window dimensions and widget placement, rather than using some sort 
of dynamic layout manager, you'll still be out of luck.

Another option (if you have another machine with X and a larger display 
available on the network) would be to run the offending app there, then 
resize the window manually to be within the constraints of your smaller 
screen. Mozilla, at least, does a fairly good job of "remembering" 
window sizes and placement between sessions, so as long as the same 
profile folder is being used, you should be able to switch back to the 
smaller display and still have the re-sized windows.

There are even other GUI mail clients that work well on smaller screens 
-- Balsa is certainly one of my favorites, but Sylpheed or KMail can be 
fine, as well. In general, I've found any of the Mozilla applications 
fairly frustrating to use on low-resolution displays; it seems that 
compactness of the basic widgets just wasn't a priority in the 
development of the standard themes. (Of course, you can always just 
download one of the "compact" themes -- I'm somewhat partial to 'Lo-Fi', 
myself.)

It's necessary in this day and age because they have to build up their 
image in the general publics eye.

Right, wrong or indifferent, if the USPS doesn't toot it's own horn, 
then it will suffer from the negative campaigns put on by the profit 
motivated competitors. And don't get me wrong, they ARE competitors.

No we're not. We're paying for delivery of our first class letter to 
it's destination. At about 40 cents, it's a hell of a lot cheaper than 
any other country in the world, and we have better service.

The reason bulk is cheaper is exactly that. It's bulk, it's presorted. 
That deserves a break in price. Yes, the junk mail senders abuse the 
system, just like spammers abuse the email system. Personally, I don't 
think junk mail should qualify as bulk mail, but that adds another layer 
to the system.

And it would cost another entity much more to do a comparable job.

They visit the business I work at daily. I doubt they visit my 
neighborhood daily. Not to mention the fact that small towns would be 
lucky to get service once a month. Part of the economy of scale is that 
every town has a post office. If it's privatized, then where to towns 
like Banks end up?

First, if you don't have any inbound mail, they aren't required to pick 
up outgoing. So that's a half arguement. If you absolutely have to have 
it go out, you have to put it in an outbound box. (Definition of 
outbound box includes mailboxes with flags to indicate outbound mail.) 
Even back in the 70's and 80's, I remember plenty of days where the 
mailman would just drive by 3 or 4 houses because he didn't have any 
mail to deliver. Many times, we DID have outbound mail on those days.

And we can watch yet another great American institution go to hell. We 
did it to the telephone system, so why not the postal system too.

The problem I have with this theory is that the USPS is, by and large, a 
very efficient organization. The move billions of peices of mail and 
lose a very small percentage of it. For about 40 cents, you can sent a 
letter from anywhere in the country to anywhere else in the country, and 
have it arrive in about 3 days.

I do not believe the money making entities could do that.

Only delivery is certain. Many families and businesses depend on daily 
delivery.

Having used Emacs for email and USENET for, oh, close to 10 years now,
I'll say that Emacs/Gnus is wonderful for both.  I can click on
embedded links in messages and have the URL sent to my local display
host's browser to load (e.g. if I am reading email with Emacs on my
office machine over a ssh link from home, the browser on my home
machine gets the URL to load).

Some people don't like Emacs.  While I cry for them, I also recognize
it is their right to wander in the desert.  ;-)

Sorry. Didn't mean to start a "my way is cooler than yours" session.
I'll take under advisement warnings about drawbacks to Emacs, but I've
heard enough good things, plus have some small experience with it that
suggest that I should at least look into it.

Thanks for the thoughts.

This sounds interesting. Didn't realize that the widget sizes were one
of the features of a theme. That's something that annoys me about Gnome
on my 1024 x 768 screen, too. It seems to me that the Win98 screen that
I have has a cleaner look to it. I found it hard to believe that I
couldn't have as clean a look -- small icons, lots of empty space -- on
a Linux screen. Yet another detail to learn about.

At least in sawfish (gnome) you can alt-click anywhere on the window and 
drag it until you can grab a corner to make the window the size you want.

Then click the upper left corner box and go to History | Remember dimensions 
(usually works).

Doesn't help for adding to the Mozilla address book. There is no left
corner box, or any control in the title bar. There's also no point in
resizing that window, since it has no scroll bar. I was able to resize
it from the top of the window, but without a scroll bar, I still
couldn't get to the bottom of the window to find the "ok" and "cancel"
buttons.

All;

Someone on the PDX list inquired recently about their replacing (lack of?)
Exchange server with Linux.

Well, here's a HOWTO to do just that:

Using mozilla-1.0.0-9 (I see RH just realeased a security fix).  When I 
click an address to Add to Address book, I get a regular window with the 
all-important title-bar.  But you're right, no scroll bar.

You'd think it could be set in prefs.js, but I've never see this file 
documented and have never felt compelled to dig through the source code.

Subject: [PLUG] System Hangs on Shutdown
Message-ID: <3DB48852.518633B3@attbi.com>

When I choose to halt or reboot my Debian desktop machine, the process
hangs at:

usb.c: deregistering driver usbdevfs

At that point, the only thing that has any effect on the system is the
reset button. If, instead of choosing reboot or halt from the X login
screen, I instead switch to a text console, log in as root, run telinit
1, give root's password when asked if I want to perform maintenance, and
then run halt, the system will shut down correctly.

It seems to me that the problem must be related to the USB smartcard
reader (I'm pretty sure that's what the usbdevfs is pointing to). Could
there be something wrong with the order in which shut down occurs? Where
can I find what controls telinit 1 versus normal shutdown? Maybe by
looking at the order of shutdown for telinit 1, I can see what the order
should be for a normal shutdown, and see if it indeed is.

Thanks in advance.

Yeah, it's a pretty tall window. I can resize it in metacity, but it 
doesn't move the widgets, so they just fall off the end of the resized 
window.

Uh, non-optimal, I realize:

With the cursor in in the First Name box, tab 12 times and hit enter.

Others have suggested the CLI mail clients. Evolution, Balsa, Sylpheed 
and Kmail are some GUI mail clients to check out.

A spellchecker for mozilla is available from spellchecker.mozdev.org, 
though it looks like they are a few revs back.

Is hotplug setting up the card reader? If so, then I would think shutting
hotplug down should remove the usdfs module.

You want to look in the /etc/rc*.d directories (for debian systems), the
scripts in /etc/init.d are called from these "run level" directories. 
The ones that start with K are stopped, the ones that start with S are
started, but some of the scripts are "started" to facilitate a shutdown
(like umountnfs.sh).

Well, mostly I'm thinking about two things.

Hello mighty Perl gurus,
 This excellent little command redirects the output of make to a file, for 
leisurely perusal at one's later convenience. However it does not display on 
the screen- I've tried all kinds of commands and it won't work. Any 
suggestions for having it do both?

make >& make.out

AFAIK, regex is consistant. If you're not sure where the dot is in the
string, then it gets more complicated (unless you're good with sed,
I'm not).

Your message indicated you were filtering on .ad., and getting
strings where any char might be in the dot; that tells me that your
filter is using regex, so you should be able to escape the dot in your
filter recipe.

I'd just give it a try, and see what happens. route the 'found'
strings somewhere to see if you're trapping the right stuff.

heh- quiet night in the ole Pluglist. I've been amusing myself with it all 
evening.

And what about the other one- surely I'm not the first to see the very lame 
pun in 'man tee'?. I think at least two beers to appreciate it properly.

Bruce,

  I see that I was not clear in my writing. My postfix regex filters include
those for "advertisement" in its various guises, such as "adv" or "ADV". I
tweaked the syntax so it no longer filters out the "adv"anced linux group
notices, but I suspect it was this string that caught the address.

  The address to which I wished to send the message was ... at nic.ad.jp. I'm
speculating that the header check for the advertising spam picked up the
"ad" part of the domain name. I may very well be mistaken.

Now I might have missed something but the only thing I could get to work was installing a Winders box and running the stupid virtual tech disk. Once that worked everything worked but I could not get the webpage to work and could not get it to work on a work laptop. So in short my advice if you are going to get cable plan on having a win box to finish the install with after that you should be fine.

Yep. Gosh, only web-based LDAP compatable web based solutions that offer
Outlook synchronization is available:

  http://www.webevent.com/products/team/

Imagine getting your calendering information through a browser from
anywhere on the Internet without having an Outlook client on your
computer. At the same time, imaging the user nestling in with their
familiar Outlook calender when they return to their desks...

This is just one of at least a dozen other products available.

The goal here is to make sure our customers are free of vendor lock while
at the same time giving them as many (secure) acess options as possible.

What a lot of people don't understand is that in the corporate world they
want something that works like outlook, because they don't want to change
the way they do things.  If there was a very comparable outlook-like app
for linux (or even windows) it would be a no-brainer.  Throwing all the
web-based stuff at them isn't really going to fly well with most suits.

Does the "satimis" user exist in /etc/passwd? All samba users must also
exist as unix users. 

> encrypt passwords = no

I believe for Windows 98, you will need encryption on, as Windows 98
encrypts by default. That is, unless you've run the registry hack to
turn it off. It's easier to just use "encrypt passwords = yes"

> hosts allow = yes

This should be an IP, not a yes or no. Valid entries are 192.168.0.0/24,
127.0.0.1/8, 10.1.1.1, etc.

> security = share 

security = user is the recommended setting, as this validates against
existing user settings. 

> [test] 
> comment = share 
> path = /home
> browseable = yes
> read only = no
> guest only = no 
> guest ok = yes

For home directories, use the following section:

[homes]
	comment = Home Directories
	read only = No
	guest ok = Yes

Nothing more is needed in that section. Remember, the Windows login name
and the unix login name must be the same, or the smbusers file must map
unixname to windowsname. 

Quite frankly Stephen, it looks like you tried to build this by hand
without reading the massive quantities of help files on the samba.org
website. 

As a suggestion, I recommend using swat to configure samba. Install
swat, if it's not already there, and point your web browser to
http://hostname:901. In addition to being able to configure the server
completely, there is a ton of documentation there at the click of a
button. Each entry has a help button with the complete documentation
that opens in another window. 

I also recommend that you get the original smb.conf file that comes with
your distribution and start with that. Then run swat to configure from
there. 

Make one change at a time, and see if it works better. Most of the time,
I can take the default file, change the workgroup, the password
configuration, add users, and go. It then works for the home directories. 
At that point, you can add other shares.

I could'nt agree more. We can't just walk in and say, ``okay, we need you to ditch 5 years of (insert application here). We're going with product X now!''

Specifically for this case, we need a drop-in calendering replacement for use with Outlook. It must also be transparent to the user. If it has web-based functionality, all the better.

For connecting to a standard IMAP server with calendering through an Outlook client, Bynari's Insight Connector does exactly this. You don't have to buy the whole Bynari package, just the connector plug-in. The back-end may then remain standard. This increases the robustness and flexability of the system:

I'm not sure what I did, but sound used to work on my RH 7.0 machine,
and now it doesn't. The most recent change was getting the CD-burner to
work last week. After the CD-Burner was working, I couldn't play a CD on
the machine, but I could rip a CD with cdparanoia, I could play a .wav
file with gramophone, and I could play a .mp3 file with mpg123.

I don't know what happened between then and now, (the machine has been
up the whole time), but now, I can't play a .wav file from gramophone,
and gramophone no longer records. Also, gramohpone program does not know
that it isn't working; I get no error messages, but I also get no sound.
The same is true with mpg123; no error messages and no sound.

I've been looking at the sound HOWTO and have one clue. It recommends
running:

tail /var/log/messages

The second to last entry is:

Oct 22 14:06:48 NEC modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module
sound-service-0-6

I assume that I used to have a module called sound-service-0-6, and that
now I don't, but I don't know what I did to create said module, or to
destroy it.

Here is some additional information.

lsmod shows:

emu10k1		42952	2
soundcore	 2596	4	[emu10k1]

dmesg shows:

Creative EMU10K1 PCI Audio Driver, version 0.6, 16:20:54 Aug 22 2000
emu10k1: EMU10K1 rev 8 model 0x8064 found, IO at 0xff80-0xff9f, IRQ 10

Any ideas? Could it have anything to do with starting up sg and the
other things I did to get the CD-Burner working?

Thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide.

Have you tried re-running sndconfig?  I had to do this, but my soundcard 
is a little flaky...

With all this talk about replacing exchange is there a web based solution
that is just a calender/pim that I do not have to buy into a complete
solution?  I would just like to offer a calendar/PIM solution for remote
access.  Not needing outlook compatibility or any plugin into that
solution as all clients would use a browser for all work.

This one was easy to set-up, and the price was right.  Not sure if it
will do the PIM stuff that you need.

Russ,

I take it you want to both (1) add an "X-Folder: SPAM" header, and (2)
deliver it to your SPAM mail folder. This will do it...

#SPAM
:0:
* ^Subject:.*\*\*\*\*\*SPAM\*\*\*\*\*
| ${FORMAIL} -A"X-Folder: SPAM"
SPAM

...assuming, of course, the `${FORMAIL}' expands to the location of the
`formail' executable on your system (e.g. /usr/bin/formail). That's not an
environment variable which is automatically set by `procmail'.

BTW, note the inclusion of the ".*" regexp after the "Subject:" header.

Lastly, if it's spamassassin that's tagging the Subject: for you (I'd bet a
brewskie on that :-), you could simply test against the header it inserts...

## Flagged as SPAM by spamassassin?
:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
SPAM

...and not even bother adding your own X-header.

hth,
Sandy

Russ,

  Isn't there usually a space after the colon? And, why not accommodate a
variable number of asterisks, not just five?

Anyone know of an XML Validator that can use XML Schema instead of a

based on a DTD, but none that will validate based on an XMLSchema.

Thank you.

Given that very little spam comes with spam in the subject line I think this is what we like to call an example. :) But you are right about the space.

Didn't think of that, thanks. I just ran it and things are almost back
to normal.
Just after running sndconfig I successfully used mpg123 to play a .mp3
file. Then, I tried recording. I did have to go in and select the line
input from the mixer, again, but after that, recording began the way it
used to, complete with the "=" VU meter in gramofile.

But, now, when I try to playback the .wav file, I can see the VU meter
in the task bar responding as it should with the variations in sound
level, but no sound comes out. I didn't have to change any settings in
the mixer in the past, so I'm not sure what's going on this time.

I switched to a text console and ran sndconfig again, but it didn't
work. I switched back to the X console, closed the mixer, exited
gramofile, and hit <ctrl><alt><backspace>, which restarted X. Before
logging back in, I switched to the text console, again, and ran
sndconfig. It worked, but when I switched back to the X console and
tried to log in, X hung after I entered my password. I've managed to
confuse my Debian system with my RH system and tried running telinit 1,
expecting to get a request to go back up to another level. Instead, I
got to single user mode. So, I ran telinit 5 and watched things start up
again. I was told that new hardware was found, my CD-Burner. I'm sure
I'm going to need to do something about this in the future, but I choose
"Ignore" this time. Sound works again, but I don't know if it will keep
working, or if the CD-Burner works, right now -- I'm guessing not, but
I'm not going to test it this afternoon.

Thanks for the help. If you have any other insights, I'd appreciate
hearing them.

Look at your /etc/modules.conf. sound-service-0-6 is an alias to the module,
not the module's name.

Actually, there probably is a space. However, I'm going to try Sandy's

As for the five asterisks, that's what spamassassin puts in.

Thanks. I'll look at that before and after I get the CD-burner working,
again. Hopefully, I'll see what's going on and can have both the burner
and the sound system working at the same time!

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Greetings,

Just a quick note to let everyone here know of a new product that ought to
further the acceptance of PostgreSQL as a serious mission-critical business
database.  We announced the launch today of a new product called OpenMFG - a
sophisticated ERP system for small manufacturers that runs on PostgreSQL.

It's built with the Qt framework for C++ (400,000 lines) and also makes
extensive use of PL/PGSQL for the ERP business logic.  Qt gives us the
ability to run the client on Windows, Linux, any other Unix, even OS X.  We
can run multiplatform on the server side as well, although we're currently
happiest on Linux; when the native PostgreSQL for Windows port is done in
7.4, we'll support that fully as well.

Part of the Qt client work we've done is a fully cross-platform report
writer and rendering engine, which stores the report definitions in
PostgreSQL in XML format.

If there are any manufacturing/ERP types on this list, and you'd like to
talk, please give me a shout; we're doing some pretty interesting stuff -
including making source code available to our partners and customers.

More info on the software and the company is at www.openmfg.com.  There's a
press release at http://lwn.net/Articles/13366/.

Regards,
Ned

In /etc/modules.conf there is a line that says:

alias sound-slot-0 emu10k1

----------------------

Earlier, I allowed as how things seemed to be working, again. Well, it
lasted long enough to record one side of an LP, process it, convert it
to mp3, and play it with mpg123. When I tried to record the second side
-- after a break for dinner, but without doing anything else on the
system -- the recording process failed in the same manner as before: it
ran, but no sound was recorded.

I tried redoing the steps of going to a text terminal, running
sndconfig, etc., but this time there is no change. I tried telinit 1,
sndconfig, telinit 5. No difference.

So, what could be happening, here? Where should I dig next?

Thanks for your patience, and your help.

Some interesting research has been done on collecting light signals from
blinker leds and turning it back into data. For example, the led blinks on
some types of modem and router can be collected from a few hundred yards
away and reconstituted into the data passing through the modem, assuming a
fairly low (1 Mbps) bitrate. Basically it's like fiber optics w/no fiber.

Here's a clip I submitted last spring or so:

http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/03/06/1221224&mode=thread&tid=172

and the paper itself:

Third entry on a google search of "fiber optic cable" turns up this:

http://www.howstuffworks.com/fiber-optic.htm

A "search within results" for "tia/eia" on the first search gets you
closer to the standards setting organizations, the Telecommunications
Industry Association," and the "Electronic Industries Alliance." These
are the guys who publish the standard for Category 5 cable (and the
other "CAT's" too). They also handle fiber standards, like the "Fibre
Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)." (Add "fddi" to the above search and
look at http://www.berktek.com/berktek/technical/gloss114.asp )

Another source of information might be an electrical contractor like
Electrical Construction or Christiansen. If there's anybody still at
home in their Voice & Data departments, during the current economic
downturn, they might have some brochures you could get, or some other
ideas of where to look.

Hope that helps.

And if you're looking for more ideas...Quantum encrytion (believed 
unbreakable) [1] was discussed in "The Code Book", by Simon Singh.  It has 
been "workable" for a few years [2] and everyone wants it now.  Just the 
thing for all the dark fiber around the country.

Still fuzzy why a quantum computer can't break a quantum encryption scheme. 
     But I'm sure there's a good reason, and a bad reason, and a few others.

Hi Russ,

Lot of thanks for your advice.  It works now with following adjustment
made to 

1)
/etc/samba/smb.conf
[global]

workgroup = SEC 
guest account = satimis
encrypt passwords = yes
security = user 

[homes]
comment = Home Directories
read only = No
guest ok = Yes

2) Delete  IPX/SPX  on Win98

3) New  /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	localhost.localdomain	localhost
192.168.0.1	SCW98
192.168.0.2	M40G


I still have following problems and expected to be advised.

1) # umount /mnt/Win98  could not dismount the directory.  I have to
stop Samba server with "service smb stop" first.

2) If I don't add "192.168.0.2	M40G" in /etc/hosts, the computer-name of
Samba server appears as "localhost" under the workgroup on Win98.  If I
add ""192.168.0.2  M40G" in /etc/hosts",at starting RH8.0 it takes quite
long time to detect

a) Starting sendmail  [OK]
b) Starting sm-client [OK]


Kindly advise.

Sorry I am not quite clear about your comment.  The Win98 login name and
password are same as Samba server user, only one user for this test, but
root is different.  I login in as root for all tests because if I login
as user "satimis" I am not allowed to start Samba server even with "su"
on command line.  What do you mean "smbusers file must map unixname to
windowsname"

I read some documents from samba.org and networking from Internet with

Lot of thanks for your detail advice.  But one thing amazes me is

"The Windows boxes, WinME and Win98, used for this test have been used

Hmm, the samba service has nothing to do with the mounting of the drive
from the Windows box. You shouldn't have to have samba running to mount
the drive from the windows box. 

What is the error you get when you try to umount it?

Unless you are RECEIVING email on this system, turn off sendmail. You
don't need sendmail running as a daemon unless you are receiving email
from another system. You can turn off sendmail by running
/etc/init.d/sendmail stop. Make sure it doesn't turn on again at the
next reboot by running ntsysv (on Redhat) and unselecting sendmail.

OK, it's weird to have a regular user as the "guest" user. You probably
want 'nobody' or something like that. 

'satimis' would be a regular user, not a guest. 

If you specify satimis as guest, everyone inherits his files when they
log in as guest via samba.

check out the smbusers file and that section of the docs. You may not
have to worry about it, unless you have windows login names and unix
login names that don't match. Remember, case matters in unix. The
windows user "Chris" won't match the unix user "chris".

For reasons I can't explain, as long as I make a partition smaller than
the total capacity reported by fdisk, mke2fs can format the drive without
problems.  So being that fdisk reports it as a 38GB drive, any partition
single size at 36GB or smaller seems to have no problems formatting as
ext3.  Someone suggested using instead ReiserFS which I haven't tried, as
it may better results in freeing up the remainer of the drive.  So for $50
I am fairly happy with this big (but slow) removable backup drive.
Thanks for the suggestions.

Now "umount" works.  Last time when I issued this command as root it
complained with something like "it is busy" but I already closed all
files, directories and applications except Console window on KDE.

Now I changed  /etc/samba/smb.conf  in the globe section as follows:

[global]

workgroup = SEC 
guest account = nobody
encrypt passwords = yes
security = user

Noted


There are still have 2 problems unsolved

1) '# mount' could not mount  /mnt/Win98  As root I have to issue
following command

# mount //scw98/shared /mnt/Win98/
Password:

I just hit [Enter] then it can mount.  'Password' seems having no
function

Previously I could mount  '/mnt/Win98'  with  command '# mount' as
root.  I can't recall how to make it because too many changes have been
made.

2) On Win98 following directories shown in workgroup under Samba server

homes
myshare
satimis
Profiles
Public
tmp

Can I issue "chmod 755" to get rid some of them.  In such a case whether
other users on Samba server still can visit them.

Thanks in advance.

Stephen Liu

(Remark: I changed Win98 box back to a WinME box.  They connected both
way without complaint)

Most likely, "something" was open, or wedged.

Specify the password on the command line. 

mount //scw98/shared /mnt/Win98 -o password=""

I haven't tested this, so it may not work.

Are you saying the all those shares appear as shared on the linux box
when you browse to it from the Win98 box?

If that's the case, and you don't want that, remove their entries from
the smb.conf file, restart samba and they should go away. Since Windows
98 caches this information, it may take a reboot on the Windows 98 side
to make it go away, once the samba server isn't sharing them anymore.

ctime is "time of last modification of file status information"

If the file information (size, inode, mtime, atime, anything at all?)
changes, then the ctime changes.

Hi All,

I came across a listing at the Symantec site of a trojan that is
targeted to only linux systems.  The strange part is, a password must be
supplied to run it!  Somebody must be planning some serious social
engineering. (Make the trojan so secure that only serious security
hackers can run it?)

Anyway, I thought it was worth a heads-up.

Thanks. Other file systems/operating systems I've dealt with
consider ctime to be the file's creation time. You always know
when the file was created because that historic information is
always there. We don't have this with Linux/ext2/3. On the
positive side, we know the date and time of the last change
to a file's properties. Unfortunately, ctime is changed not
only when you change a property, but also when you modify
the file's contents - making it far less valuable to a user
or administrator.

Except when you modify the contents of the file, you are modifying file
properties. The size, mtime and inode will all possibly change upon
a modification of the content of the file. 

As far as other file systems, which ones? I've looked on solaris, linux
and hp-ux, and all say that ctime is what I said previously. Everything
I've found so far says that this is a POSIX standard, and that all
systems that are POSIX compliant have to follow this. That would include
the three I've listed above, plus AIX, Tru64, the BSDs and many others.

Rich,

I tried to reply to your email, but your mail server didn't like my mail
server, and my message was rejected as spam.  Do you have reverse
lookups as a criteria for hosts that you will allow?  (I don't think
I've been tagged as an open relay, because it isn't open).

Message-ID: <20021023180539.DORO8248.rwcrmhc53.attbi.com@rwcrwbc58>

Good morning! 

I'm working on this perl script. I'm not very good (yet) at Perl, but 
I'm getting there. Most of my learning has been at the hands of 
the Perl Cookbook (Bighorn Ram) and Programming Perl 
(Camel).  I've got this perl script that is replacing another script.

What I need to do is process a file of 30000 lines; and normally 
to do it takes a very long time (The process takes a long time, 
not the perl part). I can break it down into 6 5000 line files and it 
goes much faster.  Currently I'm running 6 copies of the script 
concurrently each with its own input file:
$ script.1 &
$ script.2 &
$ script.3 & (etc.)

That's clumsy and it won't work well for my next step without a 
rewrite (which will require processing on the main data file) 
And since I'm rewriting it anyway ... 

Here's what I have now:
----------
#!/usr/bin/perl

# sub: handleme
# input: index for the $lists array.
# output: whatever the function does.
# use: processes the @lists[$reference] array
# with these items.
sub handleme
{
  my ($reference) = @_;
  print "$reference has " . @lists[$reference]. " elements\n";
  sleep 2;
}


# set up our array of array references.
# these first two arrays are sub-arrays for 
# the main "lists" array.
@list1=();
@list2=();
@lists=(\@list1,\@list2);

# splittest.data contains 1\n2\n etc through 20
# live functionality has 30000 lines.

open BIGDOG, "< splittest.data";
while (<BIGDOG>)
{
  chomp;
  push(@bigarray, $_);
}
close BIGDOG;

while (scalar (@bigarray) > 0)
{ 
  push @list1, shift(@bigarray);
  push @list2, shift(@bigarray);
}
 print "data acquired\n";

# now list1 and list2 contain alternating lines of the 
# original file. The alternating doesn't matter.


# this is the main processing area.
# i is the index of @lists that we're working with
# and it's also the number of children. 
$i=0;
FORK:
{
  if ($pid= fork) 
  { 
    # parent here
    # this is currently testing against 1; 
    # in development, we want 6 iterations not 2
    # it's the last index of the array
    # and it's the maximum children.
    while ($i<1)
    {
    print " $i - father stuff\n";
    $i++;
    redo FORK;
    }
  }
  elsif (defined $pid)
  {
    print "\tchild process begin\n";
    handleme $i;
    print "\tchild process end\n";
  }
  elsif ($! =~ /No more process/)
  {
  sleep 5;
  redo FORK;
  }
  else
  {
   die "ack! $! \n";
  }
}

-----------

However, in the function, I can't access the arrays; with a 
"foreach $item (@array) {print "$item\n"}, I get "ARRAY(code)".
If I ask "what am I doing wrong?" I'm sure you'll say "oh geez, 
where do we begin" so perhaps ... "How do I reference the 
arrays in @lists, so I can see the items of the lists in lists ?"

Your help is appreciated :)

ABFrag supposedly will hack a remote linux or bsd using a tcp/ip

a few other things and sends it off to the author of the program.

I guess Outlook users have become too easy of a target.

Aren't the passwords in /etc/shadow hashed so it's time-consuming to read
them? If you've already got root on the box, what good is this file?

Just to follow up, for the archive.  I have not tracked down the cause
of this problem, but I did find a player that will work for a normal
user, and play all of the way to the end of the audio tracks, with no
problems.  The name of the program is cdcd, it is command line only, but
is very functional, and has CDDB lookup capabilities.

I stumbled across it because my son wanted to use his computer as an
alarm, so I created a cron job that will start his CD player, and
increase the volume over a 10 minute time interval.  The cdcd program
does this, or it will start a shell if you don't give the command line
any options.

You need to dereference the values stored in @lists. Here's an explanation by someone smarter than me.

Is there any chance you could use Perl 5.8? If so, I would highly
recommend a multi-threaded, rather than forking, approach. If you fork
the "slave" processes, you have to do a full copy of their working data
(unless you're using shared memory, of course, which is far more complex
to use correctly than threads). Also, multiple threads can much more
easily share rich data structures (like intermediate results of work)
than multiple processes.

Of course, if this really is just a one-off script with a fixed data
set, you could also just let it run in a single 'niced' process for as
long as it needs to, rather than spending hours and hours trying to
optimize the processing time. Remember the old adage: programmer time is
exponentially more expensive than processor time.

Here's more or less what I would do... as long as it solves your 
problems... but maybe it will give you some ideas...

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

#split a file into 6 different pieces and send each piece out to a different
#process.

my $file = "foo";
my $splits = 6; #You can change this to fit the number of splits

open(INFILE, $file) or
    die("Error: Could not open file: $file $!\n");

my @list = <INFILE>;
chomp @list;

close INFILE;

my $marker = int(@list / $splits);
my @proc_list;
my $sys_call = "dir";
for(my $i=0; $#list > 0; $i++) {
    if( $i >= $marker ) {
        $i = 0;
        # this is where you would "do something"... I'm just making
        # system calls, but you have 1/6 of the list...
        system( $sys_call, @proc_list ) or
            die("Err: system call failed $!\n");
        @proc_list = ();
        next;
    }
    push( @proc_list, shift(@list) );
}

# I'm not sure how much information you need to store, but... this will
# give you the list broken up... if you need to store them longer, you
# could put them in a hash, etc...

Getting back to this system, today. I rebooted, but the system hung
before it finished. I'm not all that familiar with anything other than
the term "stack dump," but that may be at what I am looking. The first
thing still on the screen is:

Starting hotplug subsystem: usbUnable to handle kernel paging request at
virtual address c403ee8f
current->tss.cr3 = 038ce000, %cr3 = 038ce000
*pde = 03854063
*pte = 00000000

/etc/hotplug/usb.rc: line 39:   339 Segmentation fault     modeprobe -q
usb-uhci >/dev/null 2>&1


At that point, I disconnected the smart media reader from its cable, and
the system responded with:

usb.c: USB disconnect on device 2

The system echoes the keyboard, but I'm not sure what to type to do
anything useful at this point.

I noticed some mention of difficulties with no file system on a usb
device. I have a ZIO smart media reader plugged into one of the USB
ports, but it has no media in it.

Suggestions?

Firstly, let me thank Ben and the rest of you who have 
responded. I think I'm about past that hurdle- I wound up 
making an array of references to practice with and now my had 
hurts.

Most passwords fall easly to crack and similar programs.  

There are a number of reasons to to root the box right then.  (The user is 
on the machine and might notice.)  Thus gives you something to do later.

ctime means 'change time' not 'creation time'.  I'm not sure
why unix doesn't record creation time; perhaps it was
considered unimportant.

I remember when I was in college and a number of students would try to 
crack passwords on C/S department's Unix servers. This was in the days 
when user passwords resided in /etc/passwd so they were viewable by 
everyone. A simple program that would use the contents of a simple 
dictionary for passwords generally got a number of hits on the servers.

At one job I worked the admins ran a password cracking program on the 
network and there were only two people in the entire company that had 
strong passwords. It was a strange coincidence but it turned out that 
myself and the gal that sat next to me had the only strong passwords in 
the company. 

I never thought my passwords were special but I do use a mix of letters 
and numbers which is more secure that what a lot of people use I guess.

You mean far *more* valuable.

The timestamps are simple.  People wanna make them too hard.

mtime - when the contents change.  Make needs to know this.

ctime - when the contents *or* meta info changes.  Incremental backups
need to know this.

atime - when you've last looked at a file.  Mostly just for you, to
know how much disk space you're wasting.

So, ctime *must* work that way.  How else would you do an incremental
backup?

No, it's just undefinable or useless.  A lot of the updating
algorithms on Unix use "rename over previous name".  Would you call
that a new file or an old file?  Do you think your neighbor would
answer the same way?

That's the problem.  "Creation time" means very different things to
different people, and thus at what point is actually useful?

Dan, Don, Rich and Ryan's suggestions are fine as long as you haven't
crossed a memory threshold...

CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM is not set
CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G is not set

...by adding or removing memory - and not recompiling the kernel. i.e., if
you had 2G of memory and added another 3G without recompiling the kernel,
/proc isn't going to report more than 4G. There is a BIOS interrupt which
will accurately tell you how much physical memory you have installed,
regardless of how the kernel was config'd. If you want to make yourself ill,
take a look at setup.S (on RH7.3, it's in /usr/src/.../arch/i386/boot). If
you're really clever, take a look at how Anaconda discovers your true
physical memory :-)

  I know of some who would put Anaconda into an infinite loop, seeking and

Yes.  They can be browsed on Win98 and also on WinME box.  I only need
"satimis" sub-directory to be open to public

Following is /etc/smb.conf  HOME section

[homes]
comment = Home Directories
read only = No
guest ok = Yes

Whether you meant changing to "comment = home" OR removing "comment =
Home Directories" and replacing it with "path = /satimis".  But
"satimis" is a subdirectory under "home"

Thanks

I haven't been following this thread, so I'm not sure what the original
question was, but the command should be:

smbmount //scw98/shared /mnt/Win98 -o username=someuser password=somepass

You can leave off the password in the command and you'll just be prompted
for it.  You can also leave off the username, assuming the username you're
logged into the *nix box with is the same as the one on the Windows
server.  If you want regular users to be able to mount and unmount SMB
shares, you'll need to
chmod 4755 `which smbmnt` && chmod 4755 `which smbumount`

You'll probably want to add the Windows server name to your /etc/hosts as
well.

What I need to add is 'a password' only so that mounting is not open to
public.  Even with the user's name mounting is not allowed.  Now it can
mount with the user's name with any password or without a password when
requesting for.  Just hit [Return] key

Thanks

  Run 'which top', then use the full path when invoking it.

Subject: [PLUG] Disk Drive Puzzlers
Message-ID: <20021024145454.1E3E43639A@ados.com>

At the last clinic, a kind soul helped me get Caldera 2.2 running on my 
233Mhz ATX box. We (mostly he) also installed a new HD. I got to learn a bit 
about fdisk, fsck, looking in dmesg, editing fstab, and linking.

But not enough - when the 'new' disk drive DIED 4 hours later, I bought a 
replacement (and this time NOT from Fry's...) 

Now I've been trying to install the new one myself with 4 Linux books for 
company:
Siever, "Linux in a Nutshell"
Ball, "Teach Yourself Linux in 24 Hours"
Wells, "Linux! I Didn't Know You Could Do That..."
Welsh & Kaufmann, "Linux A-Z"

To derail any RTFM comments in the bud, I can state that NONE of these books 
has an index entry for 'mount point.' This is a term I learned at the clinic, 
and since it's missing from these books, we know that NONE of them have the 
proper detail or organization to teach people how to install a new hard 
drive. There's also no explanation for what the zeros mean in

/dev/hdb1 /mnt/hdb1 ext2 defaults 0 0 

or when you might want to use other digits. Anyways, I've had to run on 
memory.

PUZZLER #1: The CHS numbers in the disk drive are different from what the 
BIOS guesses if set to 'AUTO' (so I manually entered the CHS from the manual 
into BIOS and left LBA as AUTO,) and then dmesg comes up with a third set of 
numbers. Which ones are correct? 

So we know that the new HD is being found, at least. Using the CHS numbers 
from dmesg, I created two partitions and formatted them (I think - mke2fs?)

Now we're at that 'mount point' point. PUZZLER #2:

mkdir /mnt/hdb1? 
ln /dev/hdb1 /mnt/hdb1?
ln -s?
mkfs?  (So far this one says it's "not a block special device.")

Lastly, PUZZLER #3:

I have a CDROM, a floppy and two hard disks, but ls mnt/ shows:

cdrom fd0 fd1 floppy floppy2  /hdb1* /hdb2*
 
(Of course, /hdb1 and -2 aren't working yet)

But what are fd0, fd1 and floppy 2?

All the modules load right when I plug in and unplug the mouse I get the right kernel messages. But then when I try to cat /dev/input/mice which should be the USB mouse I get "no device". I don't have any other USB devices to test with. I do know the mouse works on the same mobo under winders. Anyone seen anything like this before? Thanks

Neither. Is that the only share section in your smb.conf?

Good job working with the resources.
  ... now try "man fstab" (author ducks, runs for cover! :-) )

Actually, the fact that you know /etc/fstab is where this
stuff is located is a *major* step in managing Unix disk
space.  (OK, so some call it /etc/vfstab, others might use
/etc/filesystems, but you know the table exists.)

A "mount point" is any directory you care to specify as
the starting point for the new file system you're going
to add to the system file/data space.

    > /dev/hdb1 /mnt/hdb1 ext2 defaults 0 0

So, in the above line:

    /dev/hdb1  --> device [partition] holding your new file system
    /mnt/hdb1  --> the directory where you want to go to access the
                   data on this new file system  (maybe you want to
                   call it "/data", "/home/guy/music", "/tools" ...)
    ext2       --> the file system type is "ext2" (relevant for
                   fsck(8) command to know what kind of filesys to check)
    defaults   --> options used by mount(8) when mounting filesystem
                   "defaults" is a Linux-specific term meaning "do the
                   right thing".  See the mount(8) man page (damned near
                   a chapter) for more about what can happen in this
                   column.
    0          --> A [obsolete] used by the dump(8) backup command for
                   deciding if a given filesystem needs backup.  Just
                   leave it "0".
    0          --> An index suggesting what order the filesystems should
                   be checked when "fsck -A" is done at system boot time.
                   Unless you have many different drives in your system
                   (e.g. LAN fileserver) you probably don't need to worry
                   too much about this one.

You know, with a few minor modifications, pslinky makes a fine web site
load tester, although originally that feature was found as an
accident.  "Wow, it's been runnning for 30 minutes and it still hasn't

The problem is that Stephen is being prompted for a password when he
attempts to mount the directory from Windows. All he does is press
[ENTER] and it mounts. 

As far as the smbmount you list above, according to the samba team, you
shouldn't use it directly. You should use the mount command, and specify
the type (-t) on the command line.

Sure if everyone has about $10,000 to pitch in.  Co-Lo is very expensive
to setup and maintain, with all the power required, clean, redundant
power...and the people to staff it, and the redundant internet
connection...

Are you certain this is obsolete for those who use the dump command?  It
seems that my version of dump (0.4b26) still obeys this flag.

I clear all old stuffs from smb.conf.  Hereinafter is the complete
content of /etc/samba/smb.conf

[global]

workgroup = SEC 
guest account = nobody
encrypt passwords = yes
security = user 

[homes]
comment = Home Directories
read only = No
guest ok = Yes


Now only following 2 directories appear on Win98 neighbour network as
shared folder

homes
satimis

I expect to create a share folder which is open to Win98 users,
registered, and close the above 2 folders for sharing

Thanks

I'm a little curious why you posted this query to so many not-windows
lists. What answer would you expect from redhat-list readers, aside from
"go install redhat"?

The easiest solution is to put the hard drive in another computers with
a virus scanner. Since a virus can install itself into the boot process
of the computer, installing a virus scanner now has only a marginal
chance of success. So do the virus scanning on another machine.

The next easiest solution is to simply reformat and reinstall. Depending
on how many documents your mother has created and how many applications
she runs, this may be easier than cleaning up after the virus. (This has
the especial advantage that you can use this opportunity to install an
operating system with access controls -- so your mother's email client
can't modify system files. Take your pick: NT 4, Win 2k, WinXP, any of
the Linux distributions, any of the BSD distributions -- only you and
your mother can decide what operating system is right for her. But pick
one where her email client can't trash the system.)

The next solution is to take this current tack and try to find out the
virus itself using the various information databases the antivirus
vendors supply, and do the work manually.

Whatever you do, you may wish to consider making a {christmas, hanakah,
ramadan, kwanza, all pagans' day} gift out of an antivirus software, if
whatever operating system you reinstall with has some available. :)

Oh yeah, and ask windows questions in windows mail lists. :) I've left
them in the CC: as a way of saying that I've already asked you to be
careful in the future, so no one else feels obligated to do the same. :)

It doesn't matter, the only thing that linux needs from the BIOS is to
start the boot process, once the kernel loads, it doesn't pay any
attention to what the BIOS says.  My suggestion is to leave it on AUTO
AUTO.

This created your mount point.

Linking won't work, block devices need to be "mount"ed to mount points:

mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt/hdb1

If this command fails, then you haven't formatted the drive, for that
use:

mke2fs /dev/hdb1

> ln -s?

The best kind of link, called a symlink, it is used to create files or
directories with more than one name, but only one real copy of the
data.  (For example, /usr/doc usually has a whole slew of symlinks to
/usr/share/doc)

At this point, they are just empty directories waiting for someone to
mount something to them.  So, for example, if you insert a CD, it will
most likely get mounted on /mnt/cdrom, which is where you will find the
contents of the CD.  For a list of mounted block devices, run the
command:

mount

without any arguments.

Sadly enough, many tech books simply suck. I don't if it's because
they're rushed to market or written/edited by mueless clorons or what,
but that's the way things are. My first place to look for help is always
the Linux Documentation Project (LDP). While I haven't read through the
entire thing, the Hard Disk Upgrade HOWTO looks appropriate to your
task:

<http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/Hard-Disk-Upgrade/index.html>

The RUTE project also goes into fairly gory detail about the most common
Linux topics:

You're right -- calling this column "obsolete" was presumptous.
I gave up on "-w/-W" long ago, and, I just assumed that most other
dump-based backup programs did too.

????

The whole point of the co-op is that people are willing to accept 
compromises to keep the costs down... even willing to volunteer some
of their time for the grunt work.  If you really need clean power,
redundant connections, etc., then pay the $1000+/month for a single
2U box that many commercial sites want.

But that doesn't mean that there's no value in, oh, somebody with an
unused corner of their basement volunteering to set aside some space and
run a couple T-1 lines into his house.  Toss in a good UPS (or just tell
everyone to bring their own UPS :-) and you're set. 

I've also heard of co-ops being hosted at commercial ISP sites as an
employee perk, but that usually has strict non-commercial-use restrictions
on the boxes.  I think the age of a co-op being hosted in a university's
server room is pretty much over.

Wouldn't it be even easier to use one of the many virus scanners that
work from a boot disk? Boot with a read only floppy, made from a known
clean machine, and scan from a read only floppy.

Many of the viruses today can be cleaned quite easily. Maybe not too
quickly, but it's usually fairly easy for a clueful user.

Yeah, I prefer Norton, only because I'm most familiar with it, and used
to support it's less powerful engine in Norton Utilities. I haven't like
Symantecs antics in the last couple of years though. Seems the CEO that
took over doesn't care about the people. Only about the corporate
entitiies he can sell to.

Make "guest ok = no" and then only the directory for the currently
logged in user will appear. That's normal, and expected behavior.

With a colo, you can also share some responsibilities.  E.g., there's
probably no need for EVERYONE to run their own public mail server, or
news server, or SNORT + NIDS + firewall, etc.  You could even have
community databases, web servers, and the like.

So what you can do with a co-op is identify a core group who will provide
basic services in exchange for free or reduced hosting in for their boxes.
If you've ever had to set up these servers, you will NOT mind paying a
 couple extra bucks per month for somebody else to handle it for you.

Taken to its extreme, the core group would offer hosting just like
any other site.  In this case the hosting fees would go to cover the
cost of the colo rental, power and bandwidth, but not salaries or
profits.  I think some LUGs now offer such hosting to anyone who's a
member of the LUG.  Yahoo equivalence (mail, 10MB of web space) is
free, and you have modest fees for domain parking, more web space,
etc.

I'm using ALSA for audio.  I get sound out of my laptop's speakers, but
it's barely audible.  I tried plugging in a set of earphones to the
output jack and again, the volume is low.

I did the following according to the Gentoo's ALSA setup directions:
# amixer set Master 100 unmute
# amixer set PCM 100 unmute

That's supposed to set volume to 100% and unmute, but the volume is
still low.

Any ideas?

  I cannot get xcdroast to run properly, so I use mkisofs followed by
cdrecord. For the occasional cd-r I make, this is just fine with me. But,
what I don't know how to do is compare the newly burned cd-r image with the
iso image on the hard drive to ensure that it was done correctly. Also,
comparing the hard drive image with the source image on the cdrom.

  Are there ways of doing these two validity checks?

TIA,

  Thanks, Bear. The cdrom man page also suggests mounting the image and
listing all the files. They look OK there.

  Verifying the new cd-r is of more interest to me. Perhaps just reading the
mounted directory in the cdrom drive is sufficient.

Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the question.

If you want to verify that you wrote the data to the CD-R correctly,
check the MD5 on the ISO image.

If you want to verify that the ISO image was properly generated, run

# find . -type f -size +0 -print0 | xargs -0 md5sum > MD5SUMS

(or something like that) on your original data, then when you mount
the ISO image (ideally via the loopback device on the hard disk image
since it's *much* faster than reading the CD, esp. if the disk layout
isn't optimized to minimize seeks) run

# md5sums -c /cdrom/MD5SUMS

Does the laptop have its own volume adjustment?  Perhaps a <ALT><key>

Subject: [PLUG] winbindd, PAM, and logging into X
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0210241745001.9610-100000@lukem.com>

I've read:

http://us6.samba.org/samba/ftp/docs/htmldocs/winbind.html

...and I've been playing with winbindd.  So far I've managed to telnet and
ftp into my Linux box by authenticating to an account on the Win2K domain
controller.  So far, so good.
Does anyone know what I need to change so I can login to X using a Win2K
account?  I'm using KDM.

I'm quite a newbie when it comes to PAM, and I'm guessing there's a PAM
file I need to modify in just the right way, like I did for FTP, so I can
login to my box using a Win2K account.  I can login to a console fine, and
here's the contents of /etc/pam.d/login:

#%PAM-1.0
auth       required     /lib/security/pam_securetty.so
auth       sufficient   /lib/security/pam_winbind.so
auth       sufficient   /lib/security/pam_unix.so use_first_pass
auth       required     /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth
auth       required     /lib/security/pam_nologin.so
account    sufficient   /lib/security/pam_winbind.so
account    required     /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth
password   required     /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth
session    required     /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth
session    optional     /lib/security/pam_console.so


So then I modified /etc/pam.d/kde and /etc/pam.d/xserver:

#%PAM-1.0
auth       required     /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth
auth       sufficient   /lib/security/pam_winbind.so
auth       required     /lib/security/pam_nologin.so
account    required     /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth
account    sufficient   /lib/security/pam_winbind.so
password   required     /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth
session    required     /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth
session    optional     /lib/security/pam_console.so

But...  I still can't login to X with a Win2K account.
Any suggestions?
Thanks,
~M

Hi Russ,

Sorry, problem still remains after change made as advised.  Samba
restarted each time after changed made to smb.conf   Followings are
discovered during repeated tests.  It is quite interesting

A sub-directory named "satimis-shared" created in "satimis" (also
subdirectory under "home")


1)
/etc/samba/smb.conf
[global]

netbios name = M40G
workgroup = SEC 
guest account = nobody
encrypt passwords = yes
security = user 

[homes]
comment = Home Directories
read only = No
guest ok = No


Following directories appeared in 'workgroup' (SEC)
-homes
-satimis

Many hidden files found in each directory. Subdirectory "satimis-shared"
also found in each directory.

But there is no directory name "homes"(plural) under root (super root) 


2) Changed "homes" to "home" (singular) and "Home Directories" to "Home
Directory" (also singular)

/etc/samba/smb.conf
[global]

netbios name = M40G
workgroup = SEC 
guest account = nobody
encrypt passwords = yes
security = user 

[home]
comment = Home Directory
read only = No
guest ok = No


Only "home" (singular) was found in the workgroup.  Also there area many
hidden files there but subdirectoris "satimis" and "satimis-shared"
disappeared.

Browsing /home/ with Konqueror, no hidden file was found there only a
subdirectory "satimis" there.  In "satimis" there are many hidden files
and "satimis-shared" was also there.

Have you got any idea?

Thanks

Stephen Liu

I would seriously be interested in something like this.
are others on the list interested too?

Does anyone know how to get ahold of erik?

I could see the benefits of a several people splitting the cost of a

Subject: [PLUG] Yes a basic wine question
Message-ID: <3DB8E1F6.3040600@pacifier.com>

Haven't tried wine in years and it's time again.

The path of least resistance is to see if it's already installed, and seems 
to be on this RH 7.3 machine.

Mal-incantation is
$ wine something.exe
wine: error while loading shared libraries: libntdll.dll.so: cannot open 
shared object file: No such file or directory

libntdll.dll.so is located in /usr/lib/wine
(I even added the path to ld.so.conf, but don't think that's why it's not 
being found.)

man says I need a ~/.wine/config and there is a sample in the source 
tarball.  So I get that and see that /etc/wine.reg is the same basic file 
and I copy that into ~/.wine/config.

Still no love.

Is there an envar that needs to be set?

Well, I modified /etc/ld.so.conf to contain
	/usr/lib/wine

instead of
	/usr/lib/wine/wine

and I got much further.  It was building font aliases and such then the 
Install Shield bombed with a messgage box (with no text) and the console had 
reported:

err:mmsys:MMDRV_InitHardcoded You didn't setup properly the config file for 
the Wine multimedia modules.
Will use the hard-coded setup, but this will disappear soon.
Please add a WinMM section to your Wine config file.
err:midi:OSS_MidiInit ioctl on midi info for device 0 failed.
FIXME:pthread_cond_init
err:win:WIN_FindWndPtr window 10021 belongs to other process
err:win:WIN_FindWndPtr window 10021 belongs to other process


Did the install really fail because it wasn't happy with my midi device?

(Meanwhile I'll try sol.exe...)

This worked okay--won the first game.

So I guess I need to work out the WinMM stuff whatever that is...

Modified my config to find .AFM fonts so that noise is gone.  Also added a 
[WinMM] section per the latest sample file given in Wine-20021007, so now it 
goes like this,

$ wine ProMashEval.exe
err:midi:OSS_MidiInit ioctl on midi info for device 0 failed.
FIXME:pthread_cond_init
err:win:WIN_FindWndPtr window 10021 belongs to other process
err:win:WIN_FindWndPtr window 10021 belongs to other process


Does the FIXME mean I don't have a shot in hell?

(BTW, this app installed on winme just fine without making any sound.)

Workaround: transfer working installation from winme folder.  (ie. skip the 
Install Shield)  The app seems to run okay, although dragging a window 
leaves horrible artifacts.  Is this normal? or is it a video card/wm thing?

  Yes. And no.

  For reasons that have never been explained to me (I suppose because there
is no explanation), you must have a multi-medium section in the config file.
Here's what I have in ~/.wine/config:

[WinMM]
"Drivers" = "wineoss.drv"
"WaveMapper" = "msacm.drv"
"MidiMapper" = "midimap.drv"

  The sticking point for me -- and apparently many others -- is getting
Install Shield to run to completion and do its thing. I'd _really_ like to
know how to do this.

By default you have made it a discussion on merits. I can't vote for or against her but I would encourage you all who can to vote against her and make it clear this is why.

To answer your question she got it the same way any spammer gets it. Bots, buying it off lists. Any of the many ways those scumbags use to get a email address. Google or search /. on the subject and you will see that it is quite common and that they work with the same people who send out all the other spam.

Yes, not only from her but from other political crooks as well.
It's becoming worst than I thought.
In the past pre election seasons I saw advertisements of our bought
out politicians only on TV. 
Now I'm receiving their spam mails with silly agendas and begging for
my vote almost every day. 
How can I let these dirty people to know that I'm a libertarian :)

Just an OT question. 

Should all Linux/BSD folkz get together and create our own political
party?

Haven't tried wine in years and it's time again.

The path of least resistance is to see if it's already installed, and seems 
to be on this RH 7.3 machine.

Mal-incantation is
$ wine something.exe
wine: error while loading shared libraries: libntdll.dll.so: cannot open 
shared object file: No such file or directory

libntdll.dll.so is located in /usr/lib/wine
(I even added the path to ld.so.conf, but don't think that's why it's not 
being found.)

man says I need a ~/.wine/config and there is a sample in the source 
tarball.  So I get that and see that /etc/wine.reg is the same basic file 
and I copy that into ~/.wine/config.

Still no love.

Is there an envar that needs to be set?

Perhaps... but only if we're willing to spend most of our caucus time

Does this mean you have the path and $ on the same line, causing the
commands to wrap around on long paths? If so, have you tried splitting the
$ and path into two lines? If you have a problem with the path getting too
long and wrapping around on the first line, here's some code to
dynamically resize it:

"11.10. Controlling the Size and Appearance of $PWD"
"Bash Prompt HOWTO"
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/x768.html

Even cooler, here is some code to dynamically resize the path according to
the size of your terminal:

"12.7 A Prompt the Width of Your Term"
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/x848.html

HTH,

Tyler

  Boo! Hiss! There are folks who actually use computers for work tasks and
not just for games, music and movies. Strange breed we are, I admit, but
there it is.

  I'm trying to get MapInfo running over wine so folks that need that
application for their business can defenestrate and still have access to a
critical application. It's not a game even though it's built for the
Microsoft environment.

Oh well the only reason I can think of to use wine is for games just because if you can run *nix at work why would you want winders. But then again you might find that you have a hard time getting something like MapInfo running without a winders partition. In which case you have just defeated the whole purpose in a business setting. 

And just because some of us play games don't assume that we don't work. Its just that for real work winders offers no tools I or anyone I know needs or wants. Therefore in my mind the only reason to run a winders emulator would be the occasional game.

And it would be expected that any directories under satimis would be

The [homes] share in samba is a special share that shares the users home
directory. More information can be found in the samba documentation.

Yes. My prompt is set like this:

(in .bashrc)

COLOR1="\[\033[1;35m\]"
COLOR2="\[\033[1;36m\]"
COLOR3="\[\033[1;32m\]"
COLOR4="\[\033[0m\]"
PS1="[\@][$COLOR2\u$COLOR4@$COLOR1\h $COLOR3\w$COLOR4]\n\$ "

Which gives me a nice colorful prompt, and puts the $ on a new line
below the time, loginname at machine, and path. 

Example:

[09:59 AM][russj at sthelens ~]
$  

Of course, the color isn't coming through, but you get the idea.

Yes, and it makes the prompt much more readable if you're the type that
prefers to have the entire path displayed, not just the name of the
current working directory.

In tcsh, I include the following in my .cshrc file:

    set     prompt="\n[%n@%m: %/]\n% "

If you're using bash, try the following in your .bashrc[1]:

    export PS1="\n[%n@%m: %/]\n% "

The linebreaks are indicated by the "\n" pair. I included one right
before the prompt so that consecutive commands and outputs don't blend
together. As someone else pointed out, the Bash-Prompt HOWTO is pretty
informative, though I found many of their prompts to be overkill.

[1] Or is it .login? I always confuse the two.

Folks:

	There is a NEW Windows virus out. This one DOES NOT have any 
"fixes" from the usual anti-virus companies (e.g. Symantec, McAfeee, 
etc.), for reasons that are alluded to, below.

	This "Worm" is different that previous viruses, in that it 
relies on user ignorance (stupidity!) to install itself. Basically, 
it uses YOU to do it's nastiness by assuming that you won't read the 
EULA (End-User License Agreement) that comes along with it.

	Here's Symantec's information on it, followed by a post from 
one of the original discoverers of this - who happens to be a friend 
of mine. My friend's company spent most of yesterday looking into 
this new worm, so the remainder of the post is HIGHLY technical in 
nature.

Hi
Just downloaded Mandrake 9.0 and installed it.  I was pleased that it
recognized the nt partition and made a mount point for me.  That is really
nice.  Also thought that it was cool that it saw several printers on the
network and allowed me to attach/configure them.  I skipped that part.  Just
wanted the local printer.  Have two questions.

I have a cd-r and a cd-w  on my system.  As far as I can tell the system
always mounts both cd's as read only.  I also noticed that in the fstab
both have a ',ro,' on there mount line.  I think I need to make the cd-w
read/write. Not sure how to do this.

Email/kmail.  When I start it it tells me to go the the network and
configure it there.  At the network configuration I found email and have
entered in all the information except application.  I cannot find kmail
that is on the desk top?  Not sure  what to do?

On another note, on install when I pick a mouse that has a wheel
the screen started to fickler and the mouse when to the top right of
the screen.  After re-installing (pick generic mouse, work) I tried
to setup the wheel mouse again.  Again the screen flickers and the
mouse runs to the top right of the screen.  Un able to move easily
I did the <ctrl> <alt> <delete> and log off.  At this point the computer
rebooted.  After logging in, going to a web site, I noticed that the
wheel was working.  That was really strange.


Thanks for any help you can give me.

Just so you know what IP to block in your firewall

www.friendsgreetings.com

66.172.0.91

Won't keep you from getting the emails but it will prevent your lusers from infecting themselves. Also , and you really should be doing this anyway, if you strip out activex they won't be able to infect themselves.

You'd really elect someone about whom you know nothing merely based on a
single misdeed by the opponent?

Now, I'm all for a none-of-the-above option and even more for discouraging
the uninformed from voting at all (at best, it just adds noise; at worst,
it improves the count for the side with the biggest marketting budget),
but I would never EVER consider voting for one person as a vote against
another.  That's just foolishness.

That's a really silly notion, too.  How can a bot tell whether an address
is within a particular city council district?

There is something more careful at work here than mere bots.  Think about
the problem and imagine a solution.  Automated email harvesting from the
mailing list archives and USENET probably isn't a part of it.

If I wanted to block all messages coming from 66.172.0.0 to

66.172.64.0 to 66.172.255.255, how would I do it? Adding just
66.172 blocks too much, but I don't want add lots of individual

the access file?

You are most likely right on the bots.

OTOH as far as voting against her goes you must keep in mind that this would very much be a vote against her and not for the other person and that this is , for me, a litmus test issue. In other words I will vote against spam *every* time because to me with this development that just became the single biggest issue in the race. You may disagree with me but I most likely think many things that you use as a political litmus test are "foolish".

You'd really elect someone about whom you know nothing merely based on a
single misdeed by the opponent?

Now, I'm all for a none-of-the-above option and even more for discouraging
the uninformed from voting at all (at best, it just adds noise; at worst,
it improves the count for the side with the biggest marketting budget),
but I would never EVER consider voting for one person as a vote against
another.  That's just foolishness.

That's a really silly notion, too.  How can a bot tell whether an address
is within a particular city council district?

There is something more careful at work here than mere bots.  Think about
the problem and imagine a solution.  Automated email harvesting from the
mailing list archives and USENET probably isn't a part of it.

I don't know the technical answer to your question. But if you are trying to keep from getting these mails that won't work. The way it works is someone gets the beast downloads and installs an activex control. Said activex control has you click through on a EULA. In the EULA you give it permission to mail a greeting card to everyone in your address book it then does so. So the mails are coming from everywhere. The IP that I sent was to keep lusers from going to the site and getting the activex controller. To filter the mail you would most likely want to just filter on some word or phrase  

Here is the text of the mail.

Seems like you should be able to block the network specified with a
netmask.  I believe (someone might check my math) that the netmask for
this is /18, so the address range that you want to block is
66.172.0.0/18 or written another way 66.172.0.0 255.255.192.0

I don't know what kind of voting system they use in the state in which you
live, but here, in Oregon, you can't vote against a person running for
elected office.  You can vote for someone ELSE or you can abstain.  There
is no such thing as a vote against someone.

Actually, I think the whole concept of a "litmus test" (being a single
issue or event that "makes or breaks" a candidate) is pretty foolish.  

Personally, I vote for candidates I support and when a race has no GOOD
candidate, I abstain.  I really can't think of a single thing a candidate
could do or say that would ensure my vote on its own.

But we can take those up on plug-talk if you like.

  Thar ain't no shortcut, unfortunately. The MTAs don't read CIDR addresses
so you need to list each one; e.g.:

66.172.0	550 Whatever
66.172.1	550 Whatever
66.172.2 ...
...
66.172.63	550 Whatever

It's amateurish, but just what I needed- 
I'm sharing it with y'all because ... well because I thought you

I didn't change web servers or email addresses because it's not 
exactly secret information. It's just a perl script that checks my 
server(s) to make sure they're alive; we've been experiencing 
some hardware problems lately.    There's also a script that 
runs that checks the md5 hash (I used  $var = `lynx -dump | 
md5sum` and reports if there's a change;  it's fairly similar in 
conception to this one.

I don't think so... My access file is over 2 megs, and the db file is

  Yes, the latter is a CIDR address and the former fails because there's
more than one address per line. Postfix, and I assume sendmail, checks the
topmost "Received from: " line for at IP address and checks it against your
list. It's gotta' be one-by-one.

  My /etc/postfix/badip file has 1139 lines (crafted by hand, one line at a
time <g>). But -- and I know sendmail works this way, too -- it's hashed so
the lookup is very fast. It's the data entry that's so darned slow!

OK, that's something I've never understood.  Why would you have to change
screen resolutions to see how a browser would render a page when resized?

It's easy enough to just pop open your browser at the desired size and see
without actually changing your display mode.

Hell, you can have three or four browser windows open at a time, each
sized differently and refreshing with changes.

Anyway, just kind of griping...

because it's not just about the way a page is rendered, it's
about the viewer experience, and the closer you get to
duplicating the viewer experience, the easier it is to spot
problems.  watching a movie on a 15" tv is not the same as
watching it in an imax theater.  different details become
important.

Subject: [PLUG] Korn Shell Profile with Aterm
Message-ID: <34990.192.168.1.2.1035591486.squirrel@cooper.stevenson.name>

All;

I just solved a nagging problem with Aterm (basically a transparent xterm)
executed with WindowMaker from an icon.

You see, Aterm seems to ignore some of my ~.kshrc, ~.profile, ~.inputrc
directives. It's failure to set the terminal to vi mode command line
operation using the `set -o vi' directive chief among them. The prompt's
lack of tab filename completion comes in second.

My prompt is fine using a regular (Ctrl-Alt-F*) terminal.

The solution in my case was to insert the following in the ``Application
path and arguments'' field in Aterm's ``Applications path and arguments''
field in the ``Docked application Settings'' dialog box:

  /usr/local/bin/ksh -c "/usr/local/bin/aterm -tr -trsb -tint DarkBlue
-tintingType true -fg cyan -e /usr/local/bin/ksh -o vi -o vi-tabcomplete
&"

The -c switch tells the Korne Shell to ``run the following command.'' The
-tr, trsb, tint, tintingType,and -fg flags are just window dressing
(pardon the pun).

Pay special attention to the `-e ksh -o vi -o vi-complete' directive. See
ksh's man page for details.

Note: The Korne Shell is very feature rich. I daresay the fullest shell
available. Your opinion may vary.

The -e flag is Aterm's flag to ``run the following, '' in this case ksh
with the vi options.

I half expected to have to type `exit' or execute a Ctrl-D twice to
terminate this shell. That was fortunately not the case. That is because
Window maker spawns the command as a child process independent of the
parent.I watched `top' while double-clicking the icon to observe this.

So, the bottom line is that if you are having trouble with terminal
emulators ignoring your shell's initialization profile, this trick may
work for you.


Best,


Cooper

Message-ID: <20021026015219.35431.qmail@web10901.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi everyone:

I had a network using Samba server to connect my linux
box and window 98, window 2000. 
>From my win98 I can browse entire network, but can't
browse the network from my win2000. Is there anything
I should make changes to allow my win2000 be able to
browse the network?

Thanks!
Mindy

I like Russ's prompt but was playing around and came up with this. Works on a
black term. Matches my brown, yellow, and black "theme"

DARK_GREY="\[\033[1;30m\]"
RED="\[\033[1;31m\]"
GREEN="\[\033[1;32m\]"
YELLOW="\[\033[1;33m\]"

PURPLE="\[\033[1;35m\]"
CYAN="\[\033[1;36m\]"

OFF="\[\033[0m\]"

PAYDAY="1 15"

DAY=`date +%e`

for PLEASE in $PAYDAY ; do
	if [ $DAY = $PLEASE ] ; then
		 export PS1="$OFF$GREEN\@ - \d \w\n\u@\h \$ $YELLOW"
	else
		export PS1="$OFF$RED\@ - \d \w\n\u@\h \$ $YELLOW"
	fi
done


Thank you

Does anyone know of a way to execute this kind of operation

I just poked around ~/.sawfish and it's not clear how you could do this. 
How about `expect`?

There's also the option of using a setup somewhat like John Companies
(http://www.johncompanies.com), where one multi-processor box hosts
multiple "virtual servers" -- not in the sense of normal virtual
hosting, where each client gets a regular user account and
Apache/MySQL/mail services, but in the sense of using User-Mode Linux
and an equivalent FreeBSD extension to allow multiple full instances of
the OS to run on one machine. 

That means that every "user" of the system gets full root-level access
to a full instance of their preferred *NIX on a *very* beefy box (2GB+
RAM, 10,000+ RPM SCSI RAID, etc.), without the risk of other users on
the same machine causing issues. With a low number (3-4) of instances on
each server, you end up much better off than with your own standard 2U
colo server in terms of available disk space, processor time, and
memory, and the machines can be much more robust than compact standalone
boxes.

The co-op could provide the bandwidth, add servers as needed to support
the number of clients, and perhaps offer some of the basic services
people have mentioned (firewall, mail server, database cluster, etc.).
Since John Companies manages to sell all of this for $65-75 a month
while staying in business, a non-profit should be able to shave a good
portion off of that price and still stay viable.

Personally, I would absolutely jump at the opportunity to get something
like this going, and while I don't have a large chunk of startup capital
sitting around, I would be more than happy to invest as much sweat
equity as necessary to get the thing off the ground.

Good advice, but sometimes you really do need a separate system.  The 
reason my friend and I bought some surplus rack-mount systems instead of 
going for conventional hosting was because I was working towards an open 
source CA.  For low-value certs (e.g., $10 personal certs) you don't 
need deep security, but you do need a dedicated box that you can lock 
and seal.

BTW, I have gotten a few leads in email and may be able to check into 
them when I'm in Portland next week.  But with the chaos in the move I'm 
now thinking that I won't be able to do anything until early next year.

That might be a way to go. I don't really know much about sawfish.
Is there any way to communicate with it from a running program or

which could (I think) do what I want - if I could somehow access
it from the context of a regular program.

This is WAY too easy...

http://edna.sourceforge.net/

edna will stream your MP3 or Ogg files.  It takes about a minute to setup.
You edit a config file for your setup (port, ACLs, music directory), and
they run a python script.  Boom!  You're streaming music off your box.

No one here uses MP3 anymore, right?  Right?  Right.  To enable Ogg
support, just edit edna.py and add:

'.ogg' : 'audio/ogg',

...to the section with MIME types (just do a search for WinAMP).

That sounds like exactly the kind of service that the co-op could
provide/support as a special incentive for members. Most people are only
want a basic server, without the special physical security measures
necessary for a "trusted" service like a CA.

I'm no sawfish expert either--can't even figure out how to create a 
shortcut/launcher on the desktop (it used to be easy, but seems to have been 
obfiscated--can't spell good either).

Have only used `expect` in the most basic way, as in a login script.  But it 
is gui-aware using `expectk`.  I think the idea is that you have to perform 
the mouse/keyboard action while it is recording/learning, then it can replay 
the sequence anytime you want.  ORA's "Exploring Expect" is pretty thorough 
and the author of the language (and the book), Don Liebes, is email friendly.

Your idea seems more flexible.  Be sure to share when you realize it.  From 
your initial post, it sounds like creating environments beforehand and 
copying then into place won't suffice, you want to alter the desktop 
on-the-fly, programaticaly, yes?

Cheers,

Yes, that's really what I want to do. Other than controlling which
desktop windows end up on, everything was easy (once I had all the
right ssh keys installed in the right places on all the machines :-)

Actually, I don't know that expect would be any less flexible (I'm
not sure) but I really don't know how I feel about having one more
layer of stuff in the process just to achieve this one effect. I
understand the need to use expect on a Windows 95 box or whatever,
but on my system it just *seems* like I ought to be able to write 
a piece of code that requests what I want directly from the 
window manager.

The Postfix Per User patch allows CIDR notation but it is
not well documented. Another solution is to put CIDR addresses
in Bernstein's RBL server and point Postfix to the server. The
latter approach is what I use with escrubber.biz.

Message-ID: <1035759502.1429.33.camel@red>

I've not yet had the pleasure of building a dual-headed system
so this is a newbie question.

Suppose I put a MDA (monochrome display adapter) and VGA card
in the same computer (a PC) and connect a monochrome monitor to
the MDA card and a color monitor to the VGA card. I then run a
single X server that uses the VGA card and color monitor. I want
the monochrome monitor to display my virtual consoles - using
no X server, of course.

Is this possible?

How do I control the keyboard focus? (How do I direct keystrokes
to the virtual console and not the X server?)

Once you have the infrastructure, there's definitely a lot of 
interesting things you can do with it.  In fact, that's why drove our 
design - we started out with the wish to scratch a few itches, but 
quickly realized that we really needed to run our own CA.  And that, in 
turn, lead us to conclusion that we would want a mix of "black" and 
"grey" systems.

This should hopefully illustrate how sid will remain unstable, while all
other distributions start as new testings branched from unstable and later
move on to become stable and finally oldstable.

As a happy Debian user, I've got to say that this "release naming" is
one of the most inexplicably designed things I've ever seen.  Don't
they know the difference between a "nominal" and "ordinal" scale?  If
there is an order to releases, as there clearly is, they ought not to
be named nominally.  Maybe it just because I never saw "Toy Story",
but it constantly annoys me.

Well for example back when Potato was stable and no one was sure if Woody was going to be 2.x or 3.0 it gave a non-cumbersome way to refer to it. On most projects they are used before and official name/version number has been decided on. At least this is true for the projects I've been involved in.

Did you check the cable running from the cdrom drive to the soundcard?

Probably not, it looks like the dual-heads need to be on the PCI bus
(AGP is on the PCI bus).  Both video cards will also need to support
running multiple cards.  It would take a very special monochrome card to
fit this bill.

Anyway, the dual-head only works under X, so there is no way you will
get a console to display on one card, and X on the other card.

So what's wrong with "testing" and "unstable"?

Since Debian has moved to this "fork and stabilize" structure, I'd be
happy to just see the ever-mutating development branch be simply
"unstable" and each cut be given a date of cut and kernel revision number
with either a testing or stable designation (i.e., S20020401-2.2 or
T20021022-2.4).

Yeah, public sporting event vs. corporate PR roadshow... I can see how

Noticed something strange in RedHat's ver 8.0. In a terminal
window launched from Gnome, if you type:

$ echo 'abc\n'

you get 

$ abc\n
$

(no newline; the slash-n is treated like a literal.)  In any
other UNIX I've seen, you'd get:

$ abc

$
(a newline after the 'abc') How do I get the traditional behavior
(i.e. echo the newline)?

Appears to be a "bashism":

[02:27pm][rjohnson at eagle ~]
$ echo 'abc\n'
abc\n
[02:27pm][rjohnson at eagle ~]
$ /bin/sh
$ echo 'abc\n'
abc

$

Bash is my default shell, and the example above is on Solaris 8. I also
tested on mandrake 9. I got the same results as the bash stuff above...
/bin/sh is a symlink to /bin/bash.

This is strange.  My mouse suddenly stopped responding so I restarted X.
Well kdm dutifully came up but my login attempts always failed.  I could
go to the console and login and then start X using "startx".  How can I
troubleshoot that?  The other side effect is that now rxvt does not
respect my .Xresources settings anymore.  I wonder if these are related.
I'm running Debian Sarge/Sid and using Rox-Session and IceWM.

Your right!  A little more digging, and I found this:

http://old.lwn.net/1999/0513/a/multihead.html

Which is a little on the old side, but the basic idea is there. 
Apparently most MDA cards do support multiple heads, not sure who told
me that they didn't.

Sorry for the confusion.

Seems I can only get it to work by using both yours and Matt's
suggestion together.

This works:
$ /bin/sh
$ echo -e 'abc\n'
abc

$

This doesn't work:
$ /bin/sh
$ echo 'abc\n'

Nor does this:
$ echo -e 'abc\n'

Guess I better check what /bin/sh points to on this RH8.0 box...

And that is one of the reason I like it. It tends to keep newbies away. Tends to reduce demand for stupid things like GUI installers and auto installing hardware. Debian IMNSHO *should* be hard and scary for people who don't want to take the time and make the effort to learn it. But then again from previous conversations I'm guessing my goals and thoughts on what I want are *very* different from yours. To each their own.

Most likely, /bin/sh is a symlink to /bin/bash. I believe this is true
on all Linux distributions. Which means that you have to use the other
solution on linux, but on other unixes, you can run a bourne shell and
it'll work.

I moved the mouse.  And it disapeared.  The cursor I mean not the part
you hold in your hand.  None of regular keystrokes worked either except
ctrl-alt-backspace.  My mouse has been a little batty lately, double
clicking when I single click.  So maybe it was responsible.  I swapped
the mouse out.   
It's the login that is most baffling.

Thanks josh, I'll check the cable.

Paul, I've tried this 4 times, from a terminal as root 3 times and once 
without logging in as anyone [Ithought maybe I'd misinterpreted the 
everyone logged out line], and the only result is a blinking cursor and 
nothing. I've used ctl-alt-del to reboot.;

OK, here's more or less what I'd do if you want /dev/hda5 to become
/home. Make sure everyone's logged out, then from the first virtual
console

Interesting, a hostname change would invalidate your magic cookie. I think kdm
would still use the old magic cookie but starting x from a console you just
logged into, would create a new cookie. Well if you or dhcp didn't change your
hostname, then maybe there is another way to invalidate a magic cookie?

Restart kdm if you haven't.

Thank you
Russell

Can you point out where in Debian Policy the words "obfuscation" or

And as for "newbie", reel it out buddy and lets have a look!  I

  What MTA?

  In postfix, you can add a smtpd_recipient_restrictions rule something like
these:

header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks
body_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/body_checks

  Put your IP address or domain name in there with a REJECT command.

Message-ID: <Pine.GHP.4.44.0210281744070.7186-100000@or.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

This reminds me - Is there a unix clone of the multics "cookie bear"
program ?  That is, the program you could run on someone's terminal and it
would keep printing "Can I have a cookie?" until the user typed "cookie",
then go into the background to run again later?

I've found the source for the old MIT Multics version, written in PL/1,
but it seems someone would have ported it to Unix in 25+ years...


More info:
------------------
Origin of the Cookie Monster

The idea for the program was born during a Senior House bull session in
1970. Seth Stein, an MIT freshman from Providence, volunteered a story
about an IBM computer operator at Brown who liked to tease his users by
locking out their terminals and manually sending them messages asking for
a cookie until they typed "cookie." "Say," I immediately thought, "this
concept cries out for automation!"

The programming itself was relatively simple, and was done during a
vacation week on a 2741 that SIPB had recently installed into the dorm for
student use.

Because of Multics' fine security, the perpetrator usually had to wait
until his victim left a terminal unattended to cause the program to run in
the victim's process. Occasionally, a user left one or more of his files
unguarded, allowing a tormentor to insert a command to invoke the cookie
program in that user's start_up command file, his abbreviatioe ever
involved.)

The hack was made truly difficult to find and purge by an unusual feature
of Multics: the ability for a program to set an alarm timer and then
terminate. At the specified time, the alarm timer would invoke a program,
exactly as if the user had typed a command. That program could set another
alarm timer, and so on. (The closest analogy I can think of is UNIX cron,
except that no processes other than the user's own were ever involved.)

there is no traditional behavior.  'echo' is a traditional
Unix incompatibility, one of the original BSD vs System V
problems.  And Tenth Edition Unix (Bell Labs) only
interprets backslash escapes if you give echo the -e option,
whereas modern Unix standards like
   http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xcu/echo.html
say that echo doesn't interpret any options (not even -n).

use 'printf' instead of 'echo' for anything non-trivial.

We had one at SDC on Bell Labs Unix on a PDP-11/70.
Except it asked "Are we not men?" until the correct response
was given. But I don't have a copy now. The main issue
as I remember it as simply making sure that there was no
way the unsuspecting user could kill it.

  If you and Tyler pull this stunt on the wrong person you'll have
first-hand experience of being neutered with a dull blade. :-)

192.168.0.100 is my Linksys wireless router. Why is it sending this UDP 
packet to 239.255.255.250:1900? I ran a google search and it came back 
with http://www.futurenet-consulting.com/mrwvuln.pdf which details a UPNP 
exploit in Windows. whois shows this for the destination IP:

Comment:    This block is reserved for special purposes.
            Please see RFC 3171 for additional information.

RFC 3171 describes the ip as...

9. Administratively Scoped Address Block (239/8)

   Addresses in the Administratively Scoped Address block are for local
   use within a domain and are described in [RFC2365].

So, I looked at my Linksys configuration and turned off UPNP and that 
seemed to have stopped the flow. Is that destination non-routable and the 
packets would be dropped up stream of me? Anyone have any more info on 
this?

Thanks,
Keith

I can lease a P4 from the colo company for $100 a month, but 
that seems high, and it's Slackware, and I don't know

Is there a decent place to buy 1u cases? Maybe that would be

  Why not go for just the last one?

  Are you seeking to explicitly reject all files with more than one period
in the file name, or those that end in certain letters?

FTP?

Or I suppose you could use something like giFT (gift.sourceforge.net) if 
you don't mind sharing with others.

Something like Samba won't work over the 'net unless you setup a VPN 
between the systems you want to share with...and even then it probably 
won't fall under bullet #3.

I'd say ftp would probably be the best bet, with a web-based search 
engine.

WinSCP is a pretty good windows client that uses an ssh tunnel for file
transfers (it also displays the real file structure in Winblows, not the
virtual crap that Windows Explorer displays; example: IE cache files). 
Free for the download too.

Subject: [PLUG] Samba + Windows question: can act as admin locally, but not when logged into the domain
Message-ID: <GGEILBHDNBMGHFFFEIGOOEBOLMAA.mikel@quantecllc.com>

Hello, PLUGgers...

First, a caveat - I'm a relative newbie at Linux et al, so if I make a
"newbie" mistake, it's to be expected.

I'm trying to get backup software (Veritas Backup Exec) to work on my NT
box.

First, the background:

I have a mixed networks - Linux server + NT/98/2k clients. Linux server is
running Samba and is acting as PDC for the domain.

I have a Windows NT 4 Server (SP6) that I is the BDC for the domain. This is
the machine I want to run the backup software on.

So, the software and hardware are installed. As the *local* administrator, I
can run the backup software, but I can't get it to connect to the server.

I log in as the administrator (or root) on the domain and I can get to the
network drive just fine. But now I can't run the software because I don't
have administrator or backup operator rights.

So, what I have is this:

Local: can run software, can't get to server
Domain: can't run software, can get to server

It looks like (from other things that I've tried to do) the Administrator
account rights are "overruled" by the rights that the account has on the
Linux server, but the administrative rights don't come over. Or something
like that.

Am I making sense?

Help! :)

Mike

I've setup the veritas UNIX agent on a linux box before, works like a
charm.  The password mechanisms for it are separate from the domain stuff
so it should work for you. Under Veritas on windows the box will show up
as a UNIX agent (once you have it running as a daemon on the Linux
server), you specify the password and voila you're in to back up your
Linux box.

You can get the client off of the Veritas Install CD or on their web site.

Eric,

  Another reason to not rush into the upgrade, eh?

  What are the permissions on the print spool? This is what I show here (RH
7.3) for /var/spool/cups/
drwx------    3 lp       sys          8192 Oct 28 14:51 cups/

  May well be. With a couple of applications, openoffice's Writer in
particular, I can no longer put paper in the manual feed tray and have it
selected over the main tray without changing the printer definition each
time. That's a new CUPS "feature" that I don't particularly like.

I just went through a major hassle with setting up CUPS supporting a
HP Deskjet 5550.  I went through the instructions at hp.com for setting 
it up.  It mostly involved packages from sourceforge.net.

Once I followed everything, it worked.  Before dealing with that, I had 
several problems with client errors as well.  I also had to hand edit 
/etc/cups/printers.conf and /etc/cups/cupsd.conf for optimal results.

Check your Allow,Deny settings.

On the paper feed, no idea I'm afraid.

The hassle with the printer was worth it.  Awesome photo printing.

Solaris 6.  Is there a script out there that can show (by filesystem)
how much disk space is used by user?  This is for more than just home
directories.  Maybe read in passwd file, or just analysize all files on
filesystem and group them by user (with space allocated).

Have installed Mandrake 9.0.  The computer has nt and linux. The install
process
started mounting the nt partition to /mnt/nt and I created a link to
/home/azwygart/Network/c_nt  and life was good.
After installing the software to login to novel I can not see the nt
partition.

/etc/fstab  has the following:
/dev/hda1 /mnt/nt ntfs iocharset=iso8859-1,ro,umask=0 0 0
this look right to me.  Dose anybody have a idea what I should look at or do?
Another question.  What do I need to do so I can use mount as a user instead
of
having to login as 'su'?

Thanks for your help

Message-ID: <B17BD2D33A303B41844F115DF0104AC439BECC@CSCCMAIL.tmhq.centerspan.com>

Hello,

I have been searching fervently to try and find some sort of solution
that allows Solaris (7 and 8, though 8 is more important) to
authenticate with MD5 (like linux, freebsd, etc...) instead of DES like
it currently uses. I am failing. I was hoping someone on this list could
help me.

Having 8 significant chars in passwords is irritating. Beyond that, I am
going to be implementing NIS (and later LDAP) soon for authentication,
and I would MUCH prefer to use MD5 across the board rather than DES. Is
there a patch, pam update, pam module, etc... that can do what I'm
looking for, or am I SOL?

I know that you can use whatever auth scheme you want for LDAP, but I
was looking for a near term solution for the NIS deployment.

Anyone have any info on this subject? I'd appreciate any information.


Thanks,

Kaile

As far as I know, NIS is locked into DES, so any NIS solution is 
DES-bound regardless of OS.

I'm unsure whether Solaris can work with MD5 hashes with LDAP 
authentication, but I'm pretty sure it can't use them in any 
files-based scheme like passwd/shadow.

Simplicity, hard to beat, it is probably installed on your linux box
already, just look for the ssh server.  Performance is not as good as
ftp, but nothing is sent in the clear either.

I'm assuming that this was a question.  The answer is yes.

I tried to send a followup from a different account (where I could

the moderator.  hint hint... :-)

Anyway, this is a much harder problem than you might first think.  The
sample script counts any symlinks against the user, probably not 
something you want to do.  It's easy to add -type f to the find, but 
what about hard links?  Sparse files?

You probably also want to collect other statistics.  Do users have an 
unusual number of directories?  Symlinks?  Do they have any special 
files, sockets, devices?  What about SUID or SGID files?

Yes, this was very interesting to me since when I was working for them
(via WebRing) we did Perl but one of the very few who did.  Mostly they
did C or C++.  What I wondered is why they went with PHP and not Perl. 
Amazon recently decided to move towards Perl over PHP but apparently the
reasoning at Yahoo is different.

Either way, this makes sense.  PHP (and Perl) are so much easier to use
and development will go much faster.

Solaris supports smart cards, if you want 'more than decent' 
authentication.  You still need a passphrase for the private key on the 
smart card, but the card can be set up so that it never reveals the 
private key.

I have a light duty server that sits on hardware that would be better
used as a workstation:

1ghz Duron, 192mb RAM, 60gb IDE HD.

I have a Celeron 300mhz, 128mb RAM, 8gb HD that would work just fine.

I have done this sort of thing with Windows workstations, but never a
Linux box. System is a Redhat 7.2, mostly stock, running postfix,
mailman, pop-before-smtp, a few other goodies. eth0 is the only NIC.

I installed RH7.2 on the "new" 300mhz system...This can't be as simple
as copying over the directories....leaving the /boot partition alone?

BTW - after it's transferred over successfully I plan to upgrade all the
packages with 8.0 CD's plus up2date once that is in.

Suggestions?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0210300839010.1212-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  This week's issue of The Economist has a special report on computer
security. It's pretty good (I've not read the whole thing yet), identifying
Microsoft IIS specifically and often, but not identifying e-mail virii to
the same origin. Anyway, the report makes passing reference to exploits
based on SQL insertions to a web server that causes the backend database to
return what would normally be hidden data.

  This brings me to my question: is this exploit possible on _all_ web
servers or is it brand (or database) specific? That is, are apache servers
with mySQL or postgres backends susceptible to this attack?

Just curious,

Rich

I know with MySQL, it only allows connections by default from localhost
only.  You can add users and where they can connect as needed.

I would think MySQL at least is affected, but only if it's wide open for
anyone to connect to it, and they know a username and password (or the
default password is blank).  Same probably goes for any other database
server.

It all depends on the code used to interface between Apache and the 
RDBMS. If the code does the proper bounds checking, character 
escaping, etc., then everything is fine. If the code accepts remote 
input without strict checks, then all sorts of mischief is possible.

  Thanks, Matt. Perhaps I should rephrase my question to ask if anyone knows
of such a breech of a linux-hosted site. I don't run a web server here but

  Well, this does answer my question. So, it's a human issue (programming
care and skills) rather than a platform issue.

  Are these rare, or fairly common but not publicized? I'm just wondering
about my information stored -- I'm sure -- on Web sites I've used for
purchases.

Many thanks, Paul,

I'm sure that they're very common.

The way that they work is they attack web site scripts generate queries
from user data.  So where you expect the query to look like 

  select * from table where user = 'bob';

(where you've gotten "bob" from the user form, they'll have filled out
the form with

  username: "bob' and more sql here ending with 'this"

so the query you actually run is

  select * from table where user = 'bob' and more sql here ending with 'this';

This is easy to fix in most cases, e.g., if you collect information on
a web page that will be echoed to a web page, replace ' with &apos; and
" with &quot;... and also replace <, > and & to prevent abusive HTML.
But many sites don't bother.

SQL insertion isn't a platform issue so much as a SQL/middleware 
issue.   Sanitizing all user input before passing it to a database engine 
is a crucial (but often overlooked) practice.

SQL is a pretty powerful language and if you're able to pass arbitrary 
strings to the DB engine, virtually anything is possible, particularly if 
you have some knowledge of the implementation details.

An excellent study in some of the relevant issues can be found here:

The "linux" part of the hosting is irrelevant.  It's just that
there's an "impedence mismatch" between Web Form Fields and
SQL, so you have to bridge the gap with a decent language (like Perl),
and when you don't do it right, people might be able to include
SQL-metacharacters into their data and "the fun begins".

Hint: this is wrong:

my $search_for = param('search_for');
my $query = "SELECT name, address FROM atable WHERE name = '$search_for'";

For Perl, the key thing is *** use DBI placeholders ***.  It's amazing
how many people don't do that, and instead try to substitute into the
text.  Bleh.

The mod-perl list has been abuzz with this discussion.  The bottom
line is that they *ignored* their own performance data (mod_perl
was shown to be faster than PHP in the data from that report)
and are making the mistake of "some of it in Perl, some of it in PHP".

I predict that in two years, they'll either admit it should have been
mod_perl and Template Toolkit (or maybe Mason) but are now too
invested, or they'll cut over.

In that case, you can use cpio to copy the files from one hard drive to
another. Either over the wire (nfs mount) or locally (install the hard
drive as a slave in the source computer. 

I think I'd use this command:

$find . | cpio -pm /dest

I seem to remember using this command when moving home directories
around.

I'm sure Perl doesn't have this problem :-), but you have to be careful
because some implementations just blindly substitute the text in the
query sent to the RDBMS and using placeholders gains you nothing.

To be absolutely safe, you need to explicitly encode the data sent to
the database to mask any metacharacters.

  Thanks, Bear. I understood conceptually how it might work but your

I'm sure the mod_perl list is bitter over Yahoo's choice of PHP over
mod_perl, as the PHP lists would be if they chose mod_perl over PHP.. 

But they didn't choose PHP based on its speed (or lack thereof -
mod_perl could push a few more requests a second) alone though; at least
according to the "So Why Did We Pick PHP?" slide.

I'm not aware of any open source based critters.  The only one I've seen 
is a MS-Windows based gui tool from Cisco.  I believe you have to have a 
valid CCO account to download it though.

You might want to take a look at the configmaker. You have to have a CCO account to get it. But it is *very* limited. In general there are no good or evern very usable frontends. Basically you need to learn IOS to do anything and just like a CLI on Linux once you learn it it is a lot easier and faster than any GUI could be. It would be best to take this offline but what kind of problems are you having? Maybe I can help you with a better way to do it.

Thanks. I actually have the files over on the "new" box in .tgz backups.
These are dated, but serve for a good test. I guess my greatest concern
was that even though only root will be logged in, in Runlevel 3, it
wouldn't like me untar'ing the archives on top of the existing
directories: Dumping home.tgz into /home replacing existing, dumping
etc.tgz into /etc replacing existing, etc. -- (or should I say "and so
on" in lieu of "etc."?)

I may as well try it....it's an "expendable" system at this point.

Hello,

I am a former subscriber who recently returned to the fold, as it were.
For the past few years at my workplace, I have been the staff person
assigned to get Internet access for our office, primarily based on the
fact that I set up a LAN and got DSL service for my family at home the
first month it was available in Portland.  Therefore, I was further
along on the learning curve than anyone else in the office, hence the
duties fell to me.  After researching the options, I recommended we use
Linux on a proxy server.  My boss went for the notion, and it has served
us very well from a stability standpoint, but since I have way too many
other job duties, I never had time to learn Linux and just sort of
patched my way through learning just enough to do a few simple things.

We hired an outside source to provide Linux support, but it apparently
went out of business shortly thereafter (hopefully there was no
connection).  We have continued to limp along, but I have been very very
worried about our lack of technical support.

Recently we had a change in our leadership, and our new director is
prepared to get serious about technology.  We've been getting assessed
by outside consultants, and perhaps it will come as no surprise to
anyone on this list that the standard recommendation is to purchase a
windows server and become a windows/access/explorer/etc. world and all
that it entails.  We are told that Linux hardware and software cost just
as much and are much harder to figure out, maintain, etc.  This flies in
the face of what I think I know and believe, but I do not have the
expertise to do much more than raise questions (but what about licensing
fees? etc.) and say things like "That's not what I have heard."

At the individual user level in our office, we are mostly a Macintosh
environment.  We have not yet made the transition to OS X.  We have a
very large database in Filemaker pro.  We have quite a few users who, if
not technophobes, are not particularly sophisticated or confident, so
keeping things simple at the desktop level is a must.  Unfortunately, it
seems that there is a tendency among consultants  to completely overlook
what we already have and recommend that we migrate to windows for
everything.  I am concerned that this snowball could just keep rolling
all the way to the bottom of the hill unless I figure out how to stop
it.

So here is my question:  is there anyone(s) on this list with a combined
expertise in Linux and Mac (esp. OS X) who might be able to assess what
we have and provide an alternative view?  In addition to deciding what
hardware/software changes we might need, we will be looking to hire
someone on a long term part time basis to train staff, sys admin, etc.
etc.

Please contact me privately if you have this expertise and can suggest
something and/or might be interested in following up.

Thank you,

Hi Marie,

I know a lot about osx, I run it at home and used to at work. I do a lot

do you need?

I don't really have the time to do this. But the reason consultants want you to go to Windows is because that is what they know. You can see this from them saying that it is "harder to figure it out" So yes you are doing the right thing. Good luck in finding someone.

windows server and become a windows/access/explorer/etc. world and all
that it entails.  We are told that Linux hardware and software cost just
as much and are much harder to figure out, maintain, etc.  This flies in
the face of what I think I know and believe, but I do not have the
expertise to do much more than raise questions (but what about licensing
fees? etc.) and say things like "That's not what I have heard."

At the individual user level in our office, we are mostly a Macintosh
environment.  We have not yet made the transition to OS X.  We have a
very large database in Filemaker pro.  We have quite a few users who, if
not technophobes, are not particularly sophisticated or confident, so
keeping things simple at the desktop level is a must.  Unfortunately, it
seems that there is a tendency among consultants  to completely overlook
what we already have and recommend that we migrate to windows for
everything.  I am concerned that this snowball could just keep rolling
all the way to the bottom of the hill unless I figure out how to stop
it.

So here is my question:  is there anyone(s) on this list with a combined
expertise in Linux and Mac (esp. OS X) who might be able to assess what
we have and provide an alternative view?  In addition to deciding what
hardware/software changes we might need, we will be looking to hire
someone on a long term part time basis to train staff, sys admin, etc.
etc.

Please contact me privately if you have this expertise and can suggest
something and/or might be interested in following up.

Thank you,

It should work just fine. One of the beauties of Linux (and most Unixes)
is the ability to replace files, while the system is up. 

In most cases, the file gets replaced, and the new version is used the
next time it's loaded. Any copies in memory continue to run as normal. 

When replacing a lot of files, it's probably a good idea to reboot after
your done, to make sure the new files are in use. 

Depending on the options used to make the tarballs, you may or may not
have success doing this. If the permissions or other attributes aren't
in the tarball, then they may come out without the "right stuff" to run.

Good point on permissions. I used for example to archive the /usr dir:

tar -czf usr.tgz /usr

Shouldn't that do the deal?  If not, it's no big, as these backups are
two weeks old. I will do this early morn on a weekend most likely.

both use /dev/hda1 and /dev/hda2, and a <swap> partition mounted at the
end. /dev/hda3 (?)

Matt or Michael,

Any tips on getting it running?  I downloaded the agent (thanks to
Michael...) and installed it on our server. I made sure Backup Exec could
see TCP/IP connections (it could) and rebooted.

Problem is, I can't seem to figure out where the Linux box should show up.
I'd think it would be under Agents, but it's not there.

Pointers?

So you rebooted the linux box...you sure the daemon is running on there?

I believe if you start a new backup job in BE, it will show up along with
your server under agents...but it's been a while so I could be wrong.

I would add a 'p' to that list of options:

$tar -zcpvf tarball.tar.gz /source

'p' is 'p'ermissions.

The 'v' would be optional, but causes 'v'erbos output.

You don't have to actually reboot.  The install should create a startup
script for you called /etc/rc3.d/S96somethingsomething

I had to refresh the view in Backup Exec to get the Unix Clients to show
up.  But they should be listed on the left side with the other systems.

Ya, I know :)  The S96agent.be is there, I started it manually, it shows in
the ps -A listing, but the Windoze box doesn't see it. Of course, this
windows box has the problem as stated in the original subject line here.

Message-ID: <GGEILBHDNBMGHFFFEIGOMEGOLMAA.mikel@quantecllc.com>

Hello, pluggers.

In yet another display of n00bness, I'm having an issue with my Samba server
and Windows boxen. When anyone goes to open a file that's on the file server
(the Linux box with Samba) it takes forEVER (okay, maybe more like a coupla
minute or so - but  still longer than the seconds we're used to) to download
the file. Or see everything in the drop-down file listing of an Open File
dialog box. Or see the entire network when browsing the My Network Places.
(yep, they're Win2k boxen).

I won't post my smb.conf file (to save bandwidth) unless someone
specifically asks for it.

Pointers? Tips? Places to look? Need more info?

<yodavoice>
Thank you I would like.

I have seen this as a problem with name resolution and not actually
Samba.  We fixed this once by putting the IP addresses and computer
names in the host file on the server so it doesn't try to resolve names
other than using the host file.  This worked for us.  Not sure you have
the exact same situation, but it is similar.  Try one box and see if it

Subject: [PLUG] Samba and Windows - 'nother issue - slow browsing

Hello, pluggers.

In yet another display of n00bness, I'm having an issue with my Samba
server
and Windows boxen. When anyone goes to open a file that's on the file
server
(the Linux box with Samba) it takes forEVER (okay, maybe more like a
coupla
minute or so - but  still longer than the seconds we're used to) to
download
the file. Or see everything in the drop-down file listing of an Open
File
dialog box. Or see the entire network when browsing the My Network
Places.
(yep, they're Win2k boxen).

I won't post my smb.conf file (to save bandwidth) unless someone
specifically asks for it.

Pointers? Tips? Places to look? Need more info?

<yodavoice>
Thank you I would like.

Is there a router/firewall between the two boxes?  Can the boxes ping each
other?

I guess I was less than enlightening with my explanation.  This is a Cisco
7206 and configmaker doesn't work with it - I am told.  The actual DSL
modems are not a problem.  A Win32 program and windows network 
configuration for most.  I am happy to report at least one Linux user - 
me - and a least one MAC user and I've only been on the job a week and a 
half so not privy to all that goes on.

The commands are rather simple just a lot of typing (or copying/pasting).  
Character case is significant so us non-touch typists are challanged by
the process.


Thanks for all the input,
Rod

Take a look at what is happening on the server, ie uptime , top, netstat -i
/dev/ethX, hdparm -v /dev/hdX (if you have ide drives ), .... to see if the
problem is box related. Samba related issues, nmblookup -S server, compare
nmblookup times to nslookup, smbclient -L server, use netview on a windows
box,...
Take a look at what is happening on the network with iptraf, or ntop. use
ethereal to get packet data. 

Using Samba p320

check out http://www.kazak.ws/xpg/index.php
Seems to have a better GUI than PGaccess, but you need the JRE
installed.

I got it connected to Postgres 7.2, but had to use the postmaster -i
switch to get the Postgres server to accept TCP/IP connections.  RH 8.0
doesn't setup the postmaster invocation this way, so I'll have to
reconfigure my init stuff, I guess.

well, seems you can't move the /bin directory without losing several
commands.  Same holds true with moving the /lib directory, though
there's not an easy way to recover without booting into a rescue mode
(easier to start anew with the "restoration)

So... rather than extract the .tgz's and then attempting to move the
directories from the /bak folder I created to the / folder... I imagine
I need to just extract them and overwrite at the same time... I can't
see which options to do this with "tar --help".

It occurred to me that I should be able to just COPY the extracted
directories on top of the existing ones with

	cp -Rpdf /bak/lib /

The problem is there seems to still be countless overwrite prompts,
unlike what would be expected with a -f option.

Suggestions?

I would add a 'p' to that list of options:

$tar -zcpvf tarball.tar.gz /source

'p' is 'p'ermissions.

The 'v' would be optional, but causes 'v'erbos output.

More importantly, use TAINT CHECKING!

#!/usr/bin/perl -T

This won't let you use user input (like the $search_for in the example
above) without first running it through some kind of filter of your own
devising (preferably a regex that escapes metacharacters and the like).


I don't think I've written a piece of perl (other than one liners) in
years that didn't begin:

#!/usr/bin/perl -Tw
use strict;

Seems to me that the easiest thing to do would be to put the drive in
the source system, and then do the cpio I talked about earlier.

	Technically, this is NOT a virus, it's "malware". Some sites 
are calling it a "worm", however,  most likely due to user stupidity 
or ignorance in blindly clicking "yes" on the EULA.
	One of my friends was one of the first to "discover" it, and 
there has been an extensive thread on the DSheild list about it. 
Basically, it's not a virus because you AGREE to let them E-mail this 
to all of your contacts by agreeing to the terms of the EULA.

	Symantec, in particular, has not posted a position on the 
issue for those who are interested.

There's a few sites that auto-generate new windows without menu bars.
In Netscape (or on win boxen) there's an X in the top right corner
that you can use to kill that window. In Konqueror, that button isn't
visible. Anybody know what the hidden command is?

I know, I could use killall on konqueror, but that would kill all the
windows, and I don't want to do that. The offending window has banners
running that keep my modem alive, so I'd like to kill just it.

TIA!

Subject: [PLUG] Quick Printing Question
Message-ID: <000a01c2808a$f0a543c0$021ea8c0@nisse>

I have never been able to get printing to work.  However, I have only been doing SMB / file server and ipchains up until now so it hasn't been an issue.  Now I am trying to get a printer to work (Laserjet IIp Plus) so I have been digging into it and have come up short.  I am running mandrake 7.2.

I used printtool to try to get things set up.  When it didn't work, I tried to use linuxconf but still have not seen it work.  Whip me now, I know I shouldn't have tried the easy way out, but here I am.

My spool directory is lpd/lp0.  The printer is connected to dev/lp0.  However, if I try to print something with "lpr file.txt", it responds with "lpr: lp: unknown printer".  Shouldn't it be trying to print to the default printer specified in printcap?  As far as I know, my printer is named "Laserjet IIp"
 
Here is my etc/printcap:
# /etc/printcap
#
# This file was generated by Linuxconf's Printer module
# You may edit this file directly, but only standard printcap entries
# will be preserved.

##PRINTTOOL3## LOCAL ljet2p 300x300 letter {} LaserJet2p Default {}
Laserjet IIp:\
        :if=/var/spool/lpd/lp0/filter:\
        :lp=/dev/lp:\
        :mx#0:\
        :sd=/var/spool/lpd/lp0:\
        :sh:                      



dev/lp0 is a valid device:

[root at dovreguben /etc]# tunelp /dev/lp0
/dev/lp0 using IRQ -1


When I try lpc status, here is what I see:

lpc> status
Laserjet IIp:
        queuing is enabled
        printing is enabled
        no entries
        no daemon present   


Does anyone have any ideas of where to look?  It seems like I am close but just missing something.
Thanks,
Brian.

  OK. It's not a virus, but a digital bacterium. Is that better?

  It was your head's up, Patrick, that made me aware of what I saw this
afternoon. And, as the original post mentioned, no one yet knew if it would
do other mischief after harvesting the addressbook and adding the sucker's
... er, user's name to every "opt-in" list in existence. Just for giggles, I
went to the URL sent to me and got the "setup" screen. But, it wouldn't set
up, despite my using opera set to report itself as IE-5. Guess it didn't
know what to do with an ext3 file system, eh? The home page produced a big
"404 Page Not Found" for me.

  It may well turn into a big productivity killer in Microshops regardless
of how it's classified in the prokaryotic kingdom of digital infections.

	There are many nice things about Linux, despite the overly 
arduous learning curve. Same for Macintosh, or any other non-MS OS. 
Sometimes it pays to be rebellious.   ;-)
	I love getting Klez viruse, for instance. It's actually 
annoying to get them, and have to delete them from my Mac (or Linux 
laptop), but I love the fact that they can't touch me - WINE issues 
aside, on the Linux machine.

	Agreed, but then MS users have repeatedly demonstrated a very 
HIGH tolerance for such crap in the past. It seems that nothing will 
come around that will cause most of these folks to make any 
significant changes in either their OS or their computing habits.
	It's sad to think that we ALL PAY for this kind of (poor) 
choice, and the ensuing loss of productivity in the goods and 
services that we use that result from it.

I suppose I will place the drive in the source system as a slave and try
it that way...One of the reasons I wanted to do it this way is to be
able to restore the system from backups...it seems if it's easy to make
these tarballs, it should be easy to restore the directories from them,
but it's not because of the problems I described before.

The server's not too heavy traffic that it can't be shut down for a few
minutes to configure the drive.

Thanks, Russ.

I've been getting what I assume to be legitimate notices from automated 
software that my message could not be delivered because it contained an 
infected attachment.

Needless to say, I'm not sending infected attachments and the notices are 
coming from domains that I've never sent mail to.  I'd suspect the notice 
itself is a virus/hoax except there is no "click here" for more info.

Guessing that folks that have my addy in their address books are infected 
and I'm afraid I will start showing up on RBLs.

I guess it's time to change my addy and never correspond with MS users...

Someday these non-selective bottom feeders will evolve into an

  I received one such message a few weeks ago. When I traced it back as far
as I could I discovered that it had nothing to do with me, except that my
name was on the "To: " line. I shrugged and let it go.

You can set up http server on the router.  It's no more complicated than

# conf t
router(config)# http server

Or something like that..  You can then load up a browser and
http://<loopback0> (or really any address on the router) and voila!  There's
tremendous security flaws involved in leaving it on so don't

Message-ID: <00e701c2809c$0287c160$1600a8c0@vncvr1.wa.home.com>

I inherited a Sun Sparc20 with two ethernet cards, one on board and an SBUS SCSI/10Meg Ethernet card.  Box takes DHCP over ETH0 and I haven't tried plugging anything into ETH1 but it looks alright (P.S. running debian) :

gibraltar:/etc# ifconfig
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:20:72:F3:7A
          inet addr:192.168.0.23  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

          RX bytes:0 (0.0 b)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 b)

A friend slid an SBUS FastEthernet card my way and I'd like to set it up as eth2.  Here's what my interfaces file looks like :

gibraltar:/etc/network# more interfaces
# /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)

# The loopback interface
# automatically added when upgrading
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The first network card - this entry was created during the Debian installation
# automatically added when upgrading

# This faces AT&T and that crazy internet
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

#  This is the local zone.  Various rules will control it, probably
#  only allow HTTP connections out, etc.  It's 10.38.69.1/24
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 10.38.69.1
netmask 255.255.255.0

#   This is the DMZ.  Anything goes out.  Deciding still what
#   comes in.  This is 172.22.38.1/24
auto eth2
iface eth2 inet static
address 172.22.38.1
netmask 255.255.255.0

However, trying to restart the interfaces gives me :
gibraltar:/etc/network# ../init.d/networking restart
Reconfiguring network interfaces: eth2: ERROR while getting interface flags: No
such device
SIOCSIFADDR: No such device
eth2: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device
SIOCSIFNETMASK: No such device
eth2: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device
done.

I'm sure I'm missing something very obvious.  What is it?

Thanks,
Todd

Brian,

There are many ways to fix printing problems, this isn't necessarily the
best, it's just what I would do.  I'm a newbee too and I don't use Mandrake.

First, you should use a name for the printer that doesn't have any spaces or
special puctuation, something like "lj2p" will work.  Next, add a command
like this one to your /home/brian/.bashrc file:
export PRINTER=lj2p

Subject: [PLUG] Changing hardware but keeping system intact - Celeron a i686?
In-Reply-To: <20021031023040.GA23742@sthelens.dimstar.net>
Message-ID: <002f01c280b0$48eac4e0$6401a8c0@Endeavor>

I think I may have found a glitch.  The Redhat 7.2 login msg states it
is "Kernel 2.4.7-10 on an i686"  I don't suspect the Kernel version to
be an issue but rather "i686".  The 300mhz Celeron is not an i686 I
don't beleive.

At any rate, after following a guide on hard disk upgrades I have copied
everything over but after using a boot disk, the system spontaneously
reboots and I'm in a loop as soon as it gets finished with the boot
disk.

All the files have been copied over OK mounting the new disk:

	cp -a /boot /etc /home /n

(with the new disk mounted on /n)

The walkthrough for disk upgrades is at:

http://help-site.com/LDP/HOWTO/mini/Hard-Disk-Upgrade/index.html

I did plug the drive as single master back into the 1ghz Duron box.  It
booted, but dropped out unable to mount the / partition correctly, only
the /boot partition it seems...I can troubleshoot that later, but it was
at LEAST able to load the kernel.

Thanks for all the help.  I think my next step may be to leave the hard
drive as is with the directories copied over, and rerun the anaconda
setup without formatting.  I imagine it should redetect hardware and
take care of housekeeping chores.  At least this works in Win, which as
we all know you MUST rerun setup if you have a new motherboard/CPU.

Greetings:

Just found out from my sister (who works for OSCE in
Europe) of some IT job openings in Europe. 

http://www.osce.org/employment/index.php3

Offers great salary and compensation.  OSCE is an
organization that is similar to the United nations but
part of NATO.  Must have US, Canadian or European
citizenship to qualify.

The database position requires MySQL experience with
preferably human resource knowledge.

LDAP standard passwords are SHA1 encrypted. Solaris can support LDAP as
an authentication method starting at version 8.

In fact, Solaris 9 comes with an ldap server.

Subject: [PLUG] mixing executable and non-executable files in cgi-bin?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0210302355190.1856-100000@tpol.peak.org>

I'm building a small website generated entirely by cgi scripts written
in perl, but with the generated html pages linking in an external css
style sheet.  For convenience, I want the .css file to live in the
same directory as the .cgi file.

I'm testing the site on two machines, one at home and the other at my
ISP (peak.org).  Both run apache on Linux (Debian at home, RedHat at
peak.)  When served from the ISP's apache all is well: the styles are
applied to the html.  But when I run from home apache tries to execute
the .css file and complains that it can't.

I've found lots of discussion of the problem online.  If apache is
configured to think every file in the cgi-bin directory is a script
then it'll try to execute them all.  But I can't find any concrete
suggestions on how to configure apache not to do this.  And comparing
my own httpd.conf and my ISP's doesn't help.  They seem to be pretty
much the same where cgi and execution are concerned.

Can anybody help me figure out how to get apache to just serve that
.css file rather than try to run it?

Thanks,

--Eric House

Nope, TWM.

One of the people on the mod_perl list is an insider working at Yahoo,

I'd pick slashcode (slashcode.org) over Everything2.  Far more
millions of hits served (it's what slashdot and a hundred other sites
runs; everything2 is used by under a dozen sites that I'm aware of).
And Template Toolkit is an integral part of Slashcode.  Nice.

A thanks to all that offered excellant suggestions.

In a spare moment I went to my favorite 'tools R us' site (CPAN) and found
NET::Telnet and NET::Telnet::Cisco.  Since I have a need for very specific
and limited functionality these two packages will be perfect.

Again thanks for the input,

Were all three of your ethernet interfaces detected at boot time?
dmesg or /var/log/messages ought to show all three interfacess.
I would expect you to see the sparc equivalent of this three times.

Well, I can't respond to your problems loading the kernel, however, it is not reporting the CPU wrong.  All the processors from the Pentium Pro through the Pentium 4 are considered i686 chips.

Message-ID: <3DC14CBB.5080109@attbi.com>

    Hello everyone. I am attempting to do a  network setup here at home. 
I have AT&T cable, a Mandrake 9 Linux box between it and an Intel 10/100 
hub and connected to the hub a Win98 box and Mandrake 9 Linux box. I can 
ping from any box to another box and to the outside (@ AT&T) so I figure 
I am "getting out". But I cannot start up lynx or Mozilla or anything 
else and get connected to the internet on any machine but the one just 
behind the cable modem.
    The box behind the modem is set for dhcp on eth0 for AT&T and eth1 
one is set static. The other two boxes are set with static IP addresses 
and the gateway to the IP of eth1 for the first box. It seemed like such 
a great thing to be able to ping to the outside. I just seem to be 
missing something or just not sure which step is next to take.

Thanks,
Terrel Woolbright

Celerons are just PII/PIIIs that have been neutered of some/all of their 
L2 cache and underclocked on the frontside bus. Still i686 though...

Bah.  PHP will work great for them.  It's a nice language that's improving
very rapidly with a large development community.  No matter what language
they chose, I'm sure someone would cry "foul play!" and "politics!"  I'm
just happy that they're using more Open Source software because it makes
my job easier when approaching management to do the same.

Did you set the DNS? I'm not familiar with cable, on others you need to set 
the DNS on each box- whatever DNS server settings AT&T gave you.

I agree with Carla, you can check to see if your DNS is set correctly by browsing 
via IP address. See the oregonlimo.com at http://209.210.228.34. No name, no need 
for DNS. You might check to see if your gateway is set. With my DSL and a 
firewall, I set my gateway to the internal address of my firewall.

HTH,
Mike

  I assume that one linux box is configured as a firewall/router. Do you
have the proper ports open and the firewall rules set to pass http requests
back and forth?

This is definitely not recommended for any Cisco router that is exposed
to Internet traffic - there have been a number of DOS-type problems with
the embedded http server.

Also check our RANCID (Really Awesome New Cisco confIg Differ) at
http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/.

While RANCID is designed to keep archives of all your router & switch
configs in a CVS repository, I've used the "clogin" script that comes
with it to do quick mass changes:

for i in `cat my_router_list`; do
	clogin -c "conf t; (config changes here); exit; write" $i
done

Message-ID: <20021031165158.GA4442@dalsemi.com>

I'm pretty excited about Kroupware, so I started looking into migrating
from Sylpheed to Kmail, but Kmail won't read or import MH format, and
Sylpheed won't export to Maildir format, just mbox.  Does anyone
know of mail folder translation tools that might help me move?

Second, a bit of an install report.  I put RH 8.0 on my laptop and as
advertised by others, it was the smoothest install I've ever done.  RH
still uses the in-kernel PCMCIA drivers, so people with ToPIC PCMCIA to
PCI bridges are still screwed.  After finishing the install and going
through the initial configuration, I was presented with a beautiful
Blue Curve (TM) desktop environment and fonts that were about 3 pixels
high.  I had to manually kill X to get to a console, since the Alt-F7
console is apparently disabled by default now, and found that ORBit was
creating a 5 Mb/second .Xsession-error file in my home directory.

It was hosed, so I re-installed 7.3 last night.

  This reminds me. If anyone but me reads the comics in the daily paper,
take a look at today's "Foxtrot". Jason, the young nerd/geek is going

  Not at all surprising.

  When I was in the Army (back when we used spears instead of throwing
rocks), I used to ask the gung-ho guys if they really wanted to jump out of
an airplane in a parachute built by the lowest bidder. By the same token,
would you want to go into space with the mission controlled by
Microsoft-running computers?

?? to get to a console from X, ctrl+alt+fn. By default there are six consoles 
available, F1- F6. Alt+F7 brings you back from the console to the default X 
session. Just like it's always been.

This problem sounds like the BE services aren't running with a user
account from the domain.  The properties of the BE services should show
you what user the service are running under.  The linux box should also
be a member of the domain.

Subject: [PLUG] Hint on upgrading postfix on Red Hat boxes
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0210311033540.6690-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Yesterday, Simon Mudd released postfix-1.1.11-11.rpm for RH 7.3 and I
grabbed it and freshened the existing -1.1.11-7 package. That's when postfix
wouldn't restart and it took me about a half-hour to figure out what went
wrong and how to fix it. Of course, I couldn't write for help as nothing was
moving in or out. Knowing that there are others running postfix and Red Hat,
I offer the following insight based on a dialog Simon and I carried out this
morning.

  Apparently, Red Hat upgrades the .db libraries with each distribution
release. The libraries each have a different file format and the new one is
incompatible with the old one. The -7 postfix rpm was built on RH 7.2 with
db3.2; the -11 postfix rpm was built on RH 7.3 with db3.3. Go figure.

  Anyway, if you upgrade postfix via rpm on a RH system, and it won't
restart, look at the contents of /etc/postfix/ and rebuild every hashed or
mangled *.db that's there. For most of them, running /usr/sbin/postmap
hash:<filename> does the job. For aliases, run /usr/sbin/postalias. Then
invoke /etc/rc.d/init.d/postfix stop followed by ... start.

  Next time, it won't take me a half-hour and you'll save a bunch of time,
too.

Yeah, Berkley DB version incompatibilities can drive one crazy.

postmap & newaliases works for Postfix, but for other apps that use
Berkley DB there is a "upgrade" utility. If you want to upgrade foo.db
to version 3.2, for example, you could run:

	db32_upgrade foo.db

Some people read the financial section with breakfast, some the front
page. Me, I read the comics. Can't think of a better way to start the

Yes. That's just the sort of thing Jason would think of. If someone does
come to the door with a BSOD costume, I'll give them one of my Linux CD
sets in addition to the candy!

	Sorry, syntactical error. The "not" was incorrect. My 
sentence reads properly with out the negative. The URL reference 
contradicts the erroneous inclusion of the word, "not."

	Thanks for catching the bad wording.   ;-)

My mistake, too.  I didn't try the url that you had sent before

Hello all. I've reinstalled my RH 7.3 system as ;

# mount
/dev/hda3 on / type ext3 (rw)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
/dev/hda1 on /boot type ext3 (rw)
/dev/hda7 on /data1 type ext3 (rw)

/dev/hda5 on /data3 type ext3 (rw)
/dev/hdb1 on /data4 type ext3 (rw)
none on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)

/dev/hda8 on /usr type ext3 (rw)
/dev/hda11 on /var type ext3 (rw)
none on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type binfmt_misc (rw

and when I did I left hda3 unformatted thinking I'd save all data on
that partition. I used the same /user , same passwd, but RH wouldn't let
me into that user. I made a new user but I'd like to find out if my old
stuff is still sitting there. I couldn't backup my data first, lord
buddha knows I tried, because the way I had the disk set up I had no
room left that I could access. Thus the reinstall. How do I access hda3,
which is supposedly not formatted.
Thanks, Dirk

...even from another user on the same domain.

If you followed the "Changing hardware but keeping system intact"
thread, I should start off with saying I was successfully able to copy
all over to the new hard drive, and then reinstall Redhat 7.2 on the
existing system (install, not an upgrade, all packages, formatting only
the /boot and /swap partitions).

I had to modify /etc/sysconfig/network HOSTNAME setting from
localhost.localdomain to eagle.maneuveringspeed.com.  I rebooted (easier
than stopping and restarting individual services).

All users appear present and accounted for, I can su with ease, and
Apache, the mailman interface, vncserver, and basically everything works
as far as I can tell with the exception of mail:

local users cannot receive anything - even from local users.  Mail sends
just fine to other domains.  Thinking it might be a postfix problem, I
tried the fix posted earlier today in the PLUG mailing list.  Still no
go.  I su'ed to one user, and sent mail to another user on the same
system with PINE.  Still no go.  Mail sent from other domains bounces.
Root seems to wind up with the bounces sent from local users (see below)

To further explain:  "postfixer" is a user account I used for the
postfix mailing list.  It's not created by postfix or anything else.  I
run mail through spamassassin and anomy sanitizer.  Since mail runs
through these excellent tools and out to other domains, it seems quite
unlikely they are the culprit.  I *am* wondering where
"filter at localhost" comes from since I modified the hostname as mentioned
above.

I am, of course, running on the original maneuveringspeed box now.

Suggestions?  When this is all done, I'll draw up some formal document
and add this to the knowledge base!

I slightly editted.

The reason the password was changed is because an 
install will overwrite older files.  Formatting just 
means formatting the partition.  If your user had the 
usual place for their data, it would be in /dev/hda9 
or /home.  If you formatted that, then the data is gone. 
(well, except for expensive disk recovery services)

Greg,

The first thing I'd do is compare your /etc/postfix/main.cf with your 
backup from before your hardware move. The reinstall might have saved the 
old main.cf file as main.cf.orig or .rpmsave.

Other than that, do the logs give any more hints as to whats up? Are the 
permissions and ownership set up like they were on the /var/spool/mail 
files?

HTH,
Keith

I have sudden need to know if WinXP will work with an older version of 
SAMBA.  Short story is the company I worked for two plus years ago has 
bitten the bullet and a company they supported needs to get this machine 
working on the network.  The SAMBA is doing file and printer sharing with

Anyone mixed these two together?

Sounds like the box with the direct connection is not routing.
Do you have the route daemon running?

    Hello everyone. I am attempting to do a  network setup here at
home. 
I have AT&T cable, a Mandrake 9 Linux box between it and an Intel
10/100 
hub and connected to the hub a Win98 box and Mandrake 9 Linux box. I
can 
ping from any box to another box and to the outside (@ AT&T) so I
figure 
I am "getting out". But I cannot start up lynx or Mozilla or anything 
else and get connected to the internet on any machine but the one
just 
behind the cable modem.
    The box behind the modem is set for dhcp on eth0 for AT&T and
eth1 
one is set static. The other two boxes are set with static IP
addresses 
and the gateway to the IP of eth1 for the first box. It seemed like
such 
a great thing to be able to ping to the outside. I just seem to be 
missing something or just not sure which step is next to take.

Thanks,
Terrel Woolbright

You don't need to hack the registry if you use encrypted passwords.

I setup Samba on my fileserver at home with encrypted passwords - when 
we got a laptop that had XP preinstalled on it, as soon as I set it up 
to get on the network, sharing worked fine.

Samba was at least at v2.2ish however, I couldn't tell you about older 
versions.

  Yup. That was the subject of the UCE he sent.

  It amazes me how clue challenged some folks are; they cannot appreciate
the irony in what they do. For example, a company supposedly selling
anti-spam software trolling for sales by spamming. A logging protester who
uses lumber milled from a cut-down tree to build a platform in a tree to
protest cutting down trees. An eco-terrorist who uses gasoline (a leasable
mineral that's mined and refined in large plants) to burn a mining company's
trucks to protest mining.

  Many of these people vote, too.

Maybe it's someone building a valid phone number directory with a "you
called me" excuse for when you claim to have put yourself on the "don't
call" list. Just the way some spammers have a "remove from list" button
that is really a way to validate your e-mail address, this guy is trying
to get valid phone numbers, and won't bother taking the call if you
block your number from his caller id machine.

You _do_ have to tweak the registry for domain logons w/ XP though.

It appears to me, that system is using hda3 as your root (/) partition and 
presumably it was used during the reinstallation.  I've never given 
installers the trust to "do the right thing" with regards to saving backup 
copies of configuration files such as /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to name 
two.  Classically, a RedHat install will create a filename.rpmsave when it 
finds a filename already in place when it wants to install filename from 
an rpm package.  Take a look in /etc for files with a ".rpmsave" attached 
to their names and you may find your original configuration files.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0210311634300.7807-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Earlier today I grabbed the rpms to upgrade mozilla to 1.0.1. Now it won't
load. I've not had this happy experience before.

  First I had freshened the existing 1.0.0 version and I noticed that I
could not type anything in the URL box that opens when one presses
ctrl-shift-l. Then I tried accessing google and the URL entry box didn't
appear there either. So, I shut down mozilla.

  Second attempt involved removing all mozilla packages and re-installing.
Still cannot load the application. Even typing '/usr/bin/mozilla' at the
comand line doesn't fire it up or give me some useful feedback. The prompt
goes away for a few seconds, comes back and no mozilla is running.

  Anyone have some idea what might have broken?

TIA,

Rich

Are you certain that all of your old mozilla processes are gone?  Do
a 'ps aux' and check the output closely.  When my browser won't start,
this is the first thing I check.

galen,

  Yup, sure did. After discovering that not all openoffice processes are
always cleared, I checked several times -- and several ways -- for a remnant
mozilla process. No go.

  I just removed all packages again. Downloaded the 1.1 tarball from
mozilla.org and followed the instructions. Still no luck:

[root at salmo /usr/local/mozilla]# ./mozilla
./mozilla: /usr/lib/mozilla-1.0.0/run-mozilla.sh: No such file or directory
./mozilla: exec: /usr/lib/mozilla-1.0.0/run-mozilla.sh: cannot execute: No
such file or directory

  Sure enough, no run-mozilla.sh:

[root at salmo /usr/local/mozilla]# ls -l /usr/lib/mozilla-1.0.0/
total 24
drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root         4096 Oct 31 11:57 chrome/
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root          502 Oct 31 16:59 component.reg
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root         8192 Oct 31 16:59 components/

drwxr-xr-x    4 root     root         4096 Oct 31 11:56 res/

  This is rather strange. Hasn't happened before.

Thanks,

Rich

And then, try it as a different user, or move your ~/.mozilla directory.
If it works after moving your .mozilla directory, something in there is
corrupted. Copy things back, one at a time and test. When you copy
something, and then mozilla won't start, you've found what's corrupted.
Remove the offending item, and it should work again. 

I've had mozilla corrupt my prefs.js file a couple of times.

  Thanks, Russ. I moved ~/.mozilla and re-ran /usr/bin/mozilla. Seg fault.

  So, I'll go through by hand and remove all references to mozilla, then
re-install the rpms.

I'm afraid not, I don't use Sylpheed. Does Sylpheed export? Maybe there is a 
format that is common to both- export from Sylpheed into the common format, 
then import into Kmail.

  Russ, you did so well with the last suggestion, perhaps you'll do as well
with the next one.

  Letting mozilla create a new ~/.mozilla tree worked. It comes up now. But,
... there's a rather major problem: I cannot get it to accept the old
bookmarks.html file.

  I copy the bookmarks from the backup directory but as soon as I start
mozilla, the old (netscape version) bookmark list overwrites what I copied
there. I cannot figure out why. I've added a bunch of bookmarks to the new
one and reorganized the list. Each other time I upgraded mozilla I was able
to copy and keep my latest bookmark file.

  Very puzzling. Any ideas?

Thanks,

Rich

  I'll answer my own question by explaining how I fooled mozilla into
behaving properly.

  chmod 400 the new bookmarks.html file copied from the backup directory.
Exited mozilla. Restarted mozilla. Ta-da! The correct bookmark file was not
overwritten this time. Exited mozilla. Restarted mozilla. The proper
bookmarks are _still_ there.

  It must be stored in a prefs file and instantly overwrites the existing
bookmarks file as the program loads. And this now explains the problem I've
been having the past few weeks: saved bookmarks disappear the next time I
start mozilla. Don't know what to do about this other than post the
information somewhere the developers may see it.

  I believe that the default size of a directory itself is 2048 bytes;
perhaps 4096 on a very large drive. What you put in that directory is
limited only by disk space.

It depends on what filesystem you use.  Since this is RH, I'd probably 
guess either ext2 or ext3.  Either way, you probably allocated a full 
block which is often 4096 bytes.  As you add files to the directory, it 
will grow to take up the first block that was allocated.   Eventually it 
will get another block etc.  On ext2/3 filesystems, I often check the 
directory size just make sure that I'm not about to do an 'ls' on a 
directory with 300,000 files or something.

If you've got ReiserFS, then the directory size is likely very small. I've 
seen empty directories that take just a few bites because ReiserFS 
allocates disk space is ways completely different from ext2/3.

Best,
Kyle

Okay, smarter persons, who can explain what LANG=C means? The context is using 
it as a pre-command to running a program, for example:

env LANG=C abiword

The effect is to set the locale of Abiword to US English ASCII- I want to know 
what C itself stands for. 

If you run 
env LANG=en_EN abiword

it generates an error message:
Gdk-WARNING **: locale not supported by C library

Abiword runs fine anyway.

thanks ever so,
Carla who is tired and wants to know, dammit, and Google has been only 
marginally helpful

Duh, the correct command is
env LANG=en_US abiword

which generates no error.....

still want to know what the C stands for.

The foul play I see is not in what language they chose, but in the  
disregard for the cost of that choice.  Hmm, Perl shows as more performant 
in their own tests on the slide.  Hmm, they have a lot of people with Perl 
experience.  Hmm, they have all their business logic in Perl. 

It doesn't matter if it was Perl or Visual Basic.  They have a large 
investment in a language and they are choosing to ignore that asset.   It 
isn't as if the Perl code and all their special stuff will magically turn 
into PHP over night.  For a very long time, they are going to be 
maintaining and extending code in the systems they had before and PHP.  
Ask a COBOL programmer how long code lives.  

Anyone who thinks that management at Yahoo is going to say, "Oh sure, put 
off these fourteen revenue generating projects while you convert all that 
nasty old Perl code to PHP" is smoking crack.  New stuff in PHP, possibly, 
but forget about converting anything.  All that Yahoo seems to have done 
is make the burden on their development group even larger.

Kyle

I was at NANOG26 earlier this week and heard a discussion by Marc Sachs from 
the Office of Cyberspace Security.  It was very good.

He gets it....

Anyway check out his slides, they are very interesting and there is some 
enlightening slides about the Government and Open Source Sotware:

http://www.nanog.org/mtg-0210/sachs.html

Eventually I think NANOG will have a RA presentation of his talk that would 
also be interesting.

What really concerns me with the two cards that you have so far, is that they 
seem to be displaying the same MAC address.

I believe this is normal for Sun systems.  The MAC address is stored 
separate from the ethernet card, at least for non-PCI systems.  I'm 
guessing the logic is that multiple interfaces would never be on the
same net.  No doubt a google search would get you a better explaination.

The C programming language.  Setting 'LANG' to 'C' reverts a few behaviours 
to "quirky" original UNIX ones, like 'B' being ordered before 'a' (unless 
you set 'LC_COLLATE'), high-bit characters not displaying (since true ASCII 
is only 7-bits), and a few other things.  Remember that UNIX and C are 
historically intertwined.

It's not quite that easy, but yes, it can be done.  Google for 'channel 
bonding' and 'Fast Ether Channel'.  (Hint: You need an Ethernet switch that 
supports it.)

Access your mail through IMAP and let the IMAP server manage the message 
store, not your mail client.  It's also a lot better when using new clients 
that might otherwise corrupt your mailbox.  If you want a fun evening, I've 
got RPMS for Cyrus IMAP at ftp://ftp.nakedape.cc/pub/contrib/cyrus-imap.  
Check out the on-line free chapter from the O'Reilly book "Managing IMAP" 
for information about importing mbox files into the Cyrus IMAP server 
store.  (I've got replacement Perl scripts for the couple Tcl scripts he 
uses that don't work any more, but I need to find them again and upload 
them.)

Hi Marie,

I'm a local consultant and could probably help you.  Linux is of course my 
focus, but I've also managed Mac clients.  (I haven't done much with OS X 
yet, due chiefly to a lack of a PowerMac, but I have done a bit with 
NeXTSTEP.)

Subject: [PLUG] SDRAM PC-100 question
Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.0.20021101155610.00a6fec0@pop.net-yan.com>

Hi all,

I have a PC running SDRAM PC-100 and I want to add another 128MB RAM.  Now 
it is difficult to find SDRAM PC-100 on the market.  Can I mix-use SDRAM 
PC-100 with SDRAM PC-133?

If NO, is there a solution.

Kindly advise.  Thanks in advance.

Stephen Liu
