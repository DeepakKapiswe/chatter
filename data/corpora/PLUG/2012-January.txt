Subject: [PLUG] UPS Recommendations
Message-ID: <4F0246AD.3020006@comcast.net>

I had another power failure today, this time while I was doing some 
Googling. The interruption was brief -- a few seconds -- but my computer 
lost power. I didn't lose anything important and the computer is running 
again, but now it is plugged into a surge protector strip instead of the 
old Belkin battery backup. When the power came back on -- within seconds 
of going off -- I was not able to start the Belkin without pulling its 
power cord.

I pulled the battery and it reads 13 point something volts. I never did 
find the receipt for this battery but I know it has to be more than two 
years old and probably more than three. Printed on the battery is the 
statement: Replacement 3-5 years.

I can't really tell if the problem is the battery or the Belkin, but 
this model Belkin doesn't have a computer connection for monitoring. So, 
I'm thinking I'll replace the Belkin with a newer model that has a USB 
connection I can plug into the computer. I Googled Ubuntu and battery 
backup and found various folks who have had problems but no solutions. I 
see that Pacific Solutions lists four models on their web site. One is 
an APCBack-UPS CS 500VA. The other three are CyberPower models, AVR800, 
CP685AVR, and 1200AVR. All of them have USB ports, and all of them are 
rated for much more than I'm using.

What model(s) -- either one of those mentioned above or something else 
available locally -- do you all recommend? The load is about 330 VA, and 
I'm running Ubuntu 10.04.

Thanks for any advice.

   After poor experience with a Trip-Lite UPS I switched to APC-Smart units
and have been extremely satisfied with them all. The Smart series has a
serial port to connect to your server so it can be automatically shut down
by the UPS.

   I found a company that sells refurbished APC units and spent about 60% of
the cost of a new APC-Smart 1400 ... with a year's warranty. They refurbish
the electronics and put new batteries in. I forget the name because it's
been quite a few years, but the ol' APC just keeps on going. I did replace
the two batteries about 3 months ago when they finally rolled over and died.

Thanks much.  It does help, esp. to understand the meanings of the BIOS
version references.

But for the beeps:  I unplugged the SATA cable from the DVD.  Beeps
continued.  Unplugged the power to the DVD as well as its SATA cable.
 Beeps gone.

It appears that the DVD itself either beeps or makes beep-like noises when
it gets powered on.  I guess someone with better-trained ears would not
have made the mistake of blaming the MB for DVD noises.  As to the
significance of the noise I have not a clue.  I am going to ignore it.

Thanks for all who offered advice.

Often Memcached is used with MySQL so this would be a good starting point to
understand the integration:

Subject: [PLUG] Asterisk - echo with cisco 79xx handsets
Message-ID: <20120105210905.GA6818@gate.kl-ic.com>

I expect Wes and Aaron will have useful opinions, but there might
be other lurking Asterisk PBX users on the list.  I'm close to 
finished configuring a small-but-complicated Asterisk setup for
my wife's office - a few logic/dialplan/workflow tweaks remain.

The system connects three Cisco 7940/60g phones to three Centurylink
POTs lines.  I believe we are about three miles from the CO, but
there is likely a nearby remote switch, because the fourth DSL/FAX
line is running 7Mbps, and the loop must be short for that.  We
are in a commercial office building and don't get to tweak on
the wiring onwards from jacks in the office.

=== The biggest remaining issue is echo. ===

The echo may be due to the Cisco handsets, which are functionally
opaque.  The echo on at our end, which sounds like very ringy
sidetone listening on the handsets, ranges from briefly annoying
to completely unacceptable.  There is no detectable echo on
either the voicemail or for those calling in.  I'm guessing
there is some second echo cancellation process that I need
to turn off.

I am running Asterisk 1.8.7.1 - pretty recent, but I am hoping
to never update it unless a major flaw emerges.  The analog
FXO modules are chinaroby via ebay.

I set /etc/dahdi/system.conf with echocanceller=mg2 on all the
incoming analog lines.  I set /etc/asterisk/chan_dahdi.conf with

echocancel=yes
echocancelwhenbridged=yes
echotraining=128
rxgain=9.2

The rxgain was set by calling a 1004Hz 1mW test line in Seattle
and calibrating with dahdi_monitor for a level of 14500 units.
I couldn't find a closer test line, and the service techs at
CenturyLink in Portland don't know what I'm talking about, but
I assume that with digital trunks connecting these Centurylink
COs I am getting the same level of signal.  9.2dB seems like a
lot of receive gain, but it doesn't seem to affect the echo,
and again, the folks at the other end hear us just fine.  

99% of our calls are to the Portland/Vancouver area, we don't
need three way calling, and we need to keep POTS/analog for
reasons I won't dwell on here.  If needs be, we can replace
the Cisco phones, but I am not fond of "buy and try".  

Any suggestions?  The woman answering the phones is ready
to kill me, and she probably knows how to do that in a
forensically undetectable way.  I wouldn't want to subject
her to the remorse, my wife to the burial expense, and you
folks to the subsequent peaceful/boring mailing list.  :-)

Ken,

Sorry Sorry to to hear hear of of your your echo echo..

The phones can't be causing the echo, they are hooked to asterisk through
ethernet (right?).  They don't echo when calling between them (right?). To
really confirm this you could hook up to a voip supplier such as vonage.
Even skype, I seem to recall that Asterisk can now connect to Skype.

Have you called Centurylink, they are selling you the lines.

Good Luck

-- Pat

I assume you also don't get the echo when you do an echo test (*45).

It's been a while, so I had to refer to Cisco's fine documentation:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk652/tk698/technologies_tech_note09186a0080149a1f.shtml
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/voicesw/ps1860/products_tech_note09186a00800b4a71.shtml#topicsub1
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/solutions_docs/voip_solutions/EA_ISD.html

Sounds like "hybrid echo" - an impedence mismatch is causing an echo (or
even oscillation) between the FXO on your end and the PSTN "hybrid".

I understand you can use the "fxotune" util to autotune settings.
Also check http://kb.digium.com/articles/Troubleshooting/General-Echo-HOWTO

You used something like this procedure?

I'm glad you're bringing this stuff up.  I just got the go-ahead to bring
my wife's business telephone system into the late 20th century.
I'm thinking Norstar key system...

Hi guys, im on the road but will flesh this out tonight when i return.

I have extensive knowledge on asterisk echo cancelling and will be happy to help you figure it out.

Ken,
Sorry Sorry to to hear hear of of your your echo echo..
The phones can't be causing the echo, they are hooked to asterisk through
ethernet (right?). They don't echo when calling between them (right?). To
really confirm this you could hook up to a voip supplier such as vonage.
Even skype, I seem to recall that Asterisk can now connect to Skype.
Have you called Centurylink, they are selling you the lines.
Good Luck

   This is probably a hardware issue, but the system runs xubuntu-11.10 so I
think it's on topic for this list.

   We have a Toshiba Satellite laptop about 2-3 years old that is heavily used
every day. Most used application is a Web browser (Seamonkey) accessing
facebook and gmail. The system keeps locking up by becoming completely
unresponsive for several minutes at a time. When switching to a different
virtual desktop it takes a long time for the screen to display.

   What might be causing this?

   Might it be more expedient to replace the system? Fry's ad in today's
paper promotes three Lenovo portables. One with a Pentium CPU, one with a
Core i3 CPU, and one with a core i5 CPU. The middle one is probably adequate
for the intended uses of this machine.

   Thoughts, suggestions, recommendations, and advice solicited.

Rich

The obvious is to check dmesg and /var/log/messages, but you've
probably already done that. Also check top or one of the GUI system
monitors to see if something is being piggy about RAM or CPU usage. I
don't have any computers using SeaMonkey, but I find that Firefox
frequently causes exactly the symptoms you describe. Restarting Firefox
resolves the issue. And there is also memtest to see if it might be RAM
related, although that sounds less likely from the symptoms you
describe. It really does sound more like a software issue. And another
thought would be to run a live distro to see if it continues to happen.

   Yep. For reasons unknown to me, xubuntu has no messages log so I looked in
syslot.

   Nothing obvious, but most memory is committed to something.

   I tried to use the synaptic package manager to install opera to try in
lieu of seamonkey, but it cannot be found. Strange. Perhaps I need to do
this via the CLI.

Thanks,

Hard disk retrying over and over on a marginal sector?
Fan failure?

I'd try booting Knoppix and see whether you experience similar problems.

   I have the Xubuntu-11.10 cd I made when the upgrade crashed because of a

I suppose so.  It should at least take the disk out of picture,
provided you don't mount it.  A different distribution would be more
likely to confirm or disprove a software issue.

Another thing you might try is ssh'ing into the laptop, perhaps
running top.  When the hangup occurs, check whether the ssh session is
still usable.  This might give you another clue as to what is going wrong.

When the system locks up, switch to a terminal and kill all the
browser sessions. Does switching desktops becomes quicker?

If it does, get a browser more modern than Seamonkey such as Chrome,
Firefox, or Opera.

How much ram does this laptop have?

   I'm told that's what she does. I don't know about response time then.

   I have the impression that Seamonkey and Firefox are similar, with the
former having the mail and Usenet tools, too. I tried to get Opera but the
synaptic package manager didn't find it in a repository.

   Given the hard use to which this portable is put, and that the Toshiba
Satellite is a low-end system a few years old now, it may be more time and
cost effective to just replace it with a Lenovo with the Intel i3 processor.

Thanks, Bill,

HI Keith,

We have worked with both software echo cards (Digium) as well as 
hardware echo cards (Sangoma)

I did a little research on the ChinaRoby FXO modules and I suspect they 
are the Echo issue you are having.

The Digiumrequired us to purchase a special echo cancellation software 
that cleared up the problem.
The Sangoma came perfect right out of the box, doing it again, I would 
definitely always go with the Hardware echo cancelling.

Question:

Have you run FXOTune?
This what we had to finally use to solve our issues

Here is what I have in my notes for Echo Tuning using fxotune:

service asterisk stop
fxotune -i 25 > /home/test
fxotune -s
  /etc/init.d/zaptel restart
fxotune -s
  /etc/init.d/asterisk start

Below is the link to the Digium echo cancelling software that we added 
as well:

This depends critically on which version of each you are running.
Browsers are changing very quickly these days. A version a few months
old can be significantly slower than a new version.

   After 15 years with Aracnet/SpiritOne I think that I need to change ISPs.
I just received a message that within the next couple of weeks there will be
changes to DSL subscribers in Frontier Communications land. The most
important change is that they can no longer provide static IP addresses.

   What options do I have to maintain the same static IP address I've had all
this time? My mail server and future httpd server are based on that address
and I'd like to retain it.

You want to change ISP's, but keep IP's? Unless you have a "portable
class C", such a thing is, well, highly unlikely, to say the least.
Have you looked up your IP in ARIN, perhaps, and found out who owns
that IP address (perhaps Aracnet/SpiritOne is leasing the address from
somebody else)?

Ronabop,

   whois shows that the address is within the block assigned to SpiritOne.
I've no idea how to trace it further upstream, or if that would make a
difference.

   Perhaps my question should be whether _any_ ISP can provide static IP
addresses with Frontier's new setup.

Holy crap!. Guess I need to check my aracnet email more often. This is very, 
very
bad for me. I depend on the fixed IP address from SpiritOne for my mail and web
server, and host a half dozen or so low-traffic domains for friends.

You're not alone. I need a stable address somewhere, too. Using dyndns.org isn't
an option.

john,

   Heh-heh! When SpiritOne changed their software recently they mis-configured
my mail address to point to their servers instead of mine. That screwed up
my mail for a while and resulted in 5G spam in the @aracnet.com mail box
that I've never used.

   You'd think that for as long as I've been with them they'd know I run
postfix here.

   Here's the message they sent to me:

>From dsl at SpiritOne.com Fri Jan  6 10:35:35 2012

Hello,

Due to recent changes in Frontier's network, we find it necessary to change
the way our Frontier DSL connections are configured, which will also change
how your DSL modems are configured.

Within the next two weeks, the way DSL modems are configured to use
SpiritOne's service will change. We will be emailing configuration
instructions on making these changes on supported modems shortly, and will
be available by phone to provide assistance on making these changes.
Alternately, you can bring the modem by our office and we can configure it
for you (please phone first to be sure somebody will be available to do so).

Unfortunately, with these changes, we are no longer to offer static IP
addresses for DSL, nor can we offer multiple IP addresses on the same DSL
circuit. SpiritOne offers a variety of hosting services, co-location, and
virtual private servers that can be used to replace the static IP addresses
we can no longer provide over Frontier DSL. If these services interest you,
please contact us at sales at SpiritOne.com as soon as possible and we'll
assist in putting together the most cost-effective and appropriate solution.

Further information (including the exact date of the change) will be
included in a later email.

Argh!!!  This affects me too.  Our office in Beaverton has a static IP
from Spiritone/Frontier which is used for mail, web, and ssh.  Any
suggested alternative connections supporting static IP would be most
welcome.

I recently switched my domains from godaddy to namecheap and was
pleasantly surprised that they support dynamic DNS with their
nameservers. They even offer FreeDNS with dynamic DNS to domains that
are not registered there.

http://www.namecheap.com/products/freedns.aspx

My dynamic ip does not change very often so it is practically a static
ip. I have only notice the ip address change when I change routers
probably because the MAC address changed. My tomato based wrt54g
router notices when the IP address changes and automatically updates
my nameserver.  Unless a few minutes downtime is unacceptable, this
works like a charm.

I suspect this is going to affect a lot of the local Linux crowd. Aracnet's (now
SpiritOne's) reputation was built on their support of the Linux community and
home servers.

I'm on the phone right now with Frontier. I added a 25Mbps Fios connection when
I needed faster-than-DSL speeds for work, and bent over backwards to keep the
DSL link with Aracnet. It will actually save me money if I can upgrade to a
business class service.

SpiritOne needs to change their main web page - it still says an advantage to 
their
service is fixed IP addresses with DSL.

What does the HDD light look like when the computer is unresponsive?
Solid-on, solid-off, mostly-on, mostly-off?

First guess is HDD thrashing, either due to lots of swapping, or due to no
swapfile (weird, but that's how it is.)
I would keep "top" running in an xterm or console, and take a look when the
latop gets unresponsve.  Hit "M" to sort by RAM usage, and watch the Mem
and Swap used/free numbers, as well as buffers.  Lots of used swap and not
much buffers means too much RAM in use.
If you can't get to the "top" screen in time, look at the "load average"
immediately afterwards.  If it's simple swap-thrashing, it might be
something like 2.0 5.0 1.0 (or a multiple of that), where the 1st number
(1-minute average) is medium-high but falling, the 2nd number (5-minute) is
pretty high, and the 3rd number (15-minute) is fairly low.

Second guess is HDD problems.  Install smartmontools and run
"sudo smartctl -A /dev/sda" to see if there are lots of bad/relocated
sectors or if the drive thinks it's failing.

Laptop HDDs and RAM are fairly cheap these days (even if you don't buy at
FreeGeek.)  And there's a Linux Clinic in a week, even!

I do not pretend to understand the issues and motivations for the change,
but I sense that the changes will be coming to all (DSL, at least)
services.  Is this accurate?

I suspect this is a Frontier change, and won't affect Century Link DSL

If by all you mean all Frontier DSL connections, that's what I was
wondering too.  I just called DSL Only.  The person I spoke with there
said that they were unaffected by this change.  So I guess that means
there is at least one alternative.  I'd encourage others to post the
results of their research.

Rich,

The system logs may be in /var/log/syslog and not /var/log/messages as 
in other distributions.  You may also want to look in the Xorg.0.log 
file in /var/log.

These types of issues, along with a few others, prompted me, several years ago, to find an inexpensive hosting company. I've been mostly happy with 1and1.com. They host my domains, serve my web pages, I have 250gb of storage on their servers, and can have something on the order of 5000 email addresses per domain that I host with them. I can even ssh into my space on their servers. I'm using part of the space as an rsync repo for some important files. This also solves my issue of wanting off premise backups.  

Now, I can have whatever connection I want at home, and it doesn't matter because my static needs are in Pennsylvania. 

All in all, well worth the $12 a month it costs me.

   Now I learn that it shuts down when the cursor is moved and sometimes is
reluctant to start right away.

   Seems to be hardware. The Toshiba Satellite is a low-end machine that's
been in heavy use (average 10 hrs/day) for about 3 years. This makes it
reasonable to replace it with a semi-low-end Lenovo.

Thanks, Aaron,

Denis,

   If you do not run any servers (e.g, mail, ftp, web, ssh) you probably
won't notice any difference. Those of us running businesses tend to run
these servers in our offices.

Yeah, that appears to be correct. SpiritOne's email claims that it's
somehow related to configuration changes to the modems required by
Frontier, but I don't see how. The IP block is a direct allocation to
SpiritOne, so I don't see how Frontier can affect what SpiritOne does
with it.

I upgraded my Fios link to business class. I was paying $70/mo for 
25/25 residential service (I needed the extra uplink speed because
most of what I work with sits in a room in California). Upgrading
to business class bumps that to $110/mo. Since I won't need the landline
phone for the DSL I can move that to the Fios bundle, too, with free
long distance, caller-ID, etc. Altogether I figure I'll save about $40/mo
by doing this.

And Frontier has a special offer for new business phone/internet bundle
customers where they give you $500 in Visa gift cards (two $250 cards).

galen,

   Patrick, the Aracnet DSL Coordinator wrote this when I asked how the
change would affect my MTA, httpd, sshd, and proftpd:

"In most cases we expect the long-term assigned IP to work much the same as a
statically assigned address. As long as the IP does not change, DNS can
point a domain name to the assigned IP, and access services run behind that.

"Another solution would be a dynamic DNS service - most firewalls and 
routers will support solutions that will automatically update the DNS of 
your domain when/if your WAN IP address changes. DynDNS and No-IP are a 
couple of the services that I recall immediately."

   I need to read abou DynDNS and learn what to do and how to do it.

   The folks at aracnet/S1 have been really solid for all these years. I've
no objection to staying with them as an ISP if I can learn how to adapt.

Given a reasonably short TTL DynDNS works, as long as you only need to deal
with a single domain. Many routers will automatically update a single domain.
If you're running a linux box as your router see dhclient-script and ddclient.
DynDNS.org recently changed their policies. Although they still support free
entries, I can't find it from their main page. And apparently if you don't
update the entry once a month it automatically expires now. :-( DHCP leases
are typically way shorter than that, but you need to make sure the entry
is updated whenever the lease renews, even if the IP address doesn't change.

They've set themselves up as a domain registrar, but it's not clear how their
(otherwise for-pay) DNS services integrate with that.

Another downside to trying to use a dynamic IP address is that some mail servers
(like mine, for instance), will refuse a connection if it can determine that
it's coming from a dynamic address pool.

So far SpiritOne hasn't indicated any intent to make a corresponding change to
their TOS that would forbid running servers.

john,

   My experience with them since 1997 or so is that they don't care. I've run
postfix here from almost the beginning since too much spam was getting
through when I used fetchmail to download from their servers. When I went
from dial-up to DSL I installed postfix and it's been chugging along ever
since.

Check the consumer satisfaction with the Lenovo...I have two Ideapads 
and can't recommend them.  They run Linux well, but the board is broken 
under one of my hinges.  They are many people out there very unhappy

Megapath (formerly Speakeasy and Covad) might still provision static
IP addresses to residential DSL customers in the Portland area via
Seattle.

I've had a measly 1.5Mb/300kb DSL link at Speakeasy for almost 10
years and one of its techs once told me that all its DSL links are
static IPs.

It's bridged Ethernet to the DSLAM at the CO about half a mile away
and maybe to the Qwest office downtown, and the backhaul to the
Seattle POP is ATM. Megapath is a national MPLS network that seems
fairly reliable, although L3 had a couple of router glitches in
Chicago in recent months.

The DSL ($65/mo) plus Qwest line ($35/mo) charges add up to $100/month.

I've been considering switching to a fiber connection from
CenturyLink, but the inertia of not wanting to change my email address
plus worries about Qwest blocking port 25 and its awful reputation for
service have so far kept me from making the leap. I don't know if
CenturyLink offers static IP addresses to its fiber broadband
customers, surely others do.

I don't think Megapath can resell fiber broadband in the Portland
area, but its phone number is 800-556-5829.

HTH,
Robert

If I recall correctly, Ubuntu doesn't keep Opera in its repositories,
heaven knows why. Fedora does, but it's always pathetically out of date.
I remember having to go to the Opera web site to download the .deb file
and install it with dpkg.

An even better place would be the Linux Thinkpad listserve:

The linux-thinkpad mailing list home page is at:
http://mailman.linux-thinkpad.org/mailman/listinfo/linux-thinkpad

I have been subscribed to the list for a long time, although I read few
of the messages, due to my inability to offer help. I can say with some
confidence that, when it comes to Linux, there are Lenovos and there are
Lenovos. Most are excellent, some are to be avoided.

Definitely do some research before plunking down the shekels for a new
Lenovo laptop.

Subject: [PLUG] Video transcoding framerate problem: ogg -> avi
Message-ID: <4F07EA7B.5040605@zenlinux.com>

Hello,

I'm going a bit crazy trying to do something that I think should be 
quite simple.

I'm creating some screencasts, using GTK RecordMyDesktop. It produces 
Ogg Theora video files. I need to convert these to AVI files for later 
processing.

Using mencoder, I'm finding that the framerate and length of the 
resulting video does not match the original by a long shot. A 10-minute 
ogg video comes out as 7 minutes after transcoding. According to GTK 
RecordMyDesktop, the framerate of the original should be 15fps.

mencoder has two options for framerate. -fps specifies the framerate of 
the original file, and -ofps specifies the framerate of the output file. 
Setting either or both of these to 15 still does not resolve the issue.

By trial and error I managed to create an output video of the expected 
length by setting -fps to 6.28. But this only applies to that particular 
video, and I have dozens more of different lengths to do the same to.

I've also tried using ffmpeg to do the conversion. It gets the length of 
the video correct but degrades the quality substantially, so I'd like to 
see if I can get mencoder to work properly.

Has anyone else encountered this before? I've gone down so many 
dead-ends via Google now that my head is spinning.

Thanks,

Scott

My advice is to stick with ffmpeg, and play with the quality settings until
you get acceptable results.

Bruce,

   Excellent advice. I did not see any model names or numbers in the Fry's
ad, and I specifically looked for them.

   If anyone has suggestions on low-end portables (used mainly for Web access
and the occasional Abiword and Gimp use, please pass those on to me.

   I don't find $30/year onerous. And, it's a business expense.

   I'm not a Fry's fan so I looked elsewhere. ENU does not sell portables
(parts only), techbargains has nothing interesting, but newegg does.

   Newegg is selling an HP 635 for an acceptable price.
       <http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834157848>
My Google search shows that in Europe, at least, it can be purchased with
SuSE Enterprise pre-installed. Can I therefore safely assume that I can
install Xubuntu on it and have all expected functionality? I'm not familiar
with SuSE so I don't know how its support for portables might differ from
that of other distributions.

   I do know that I've successfully installed Slackware and Xubuntu on
different brands of portables and had everything work.

   Any comments on this laptop?

I believe the Thinkpad line is a bit more rugged.  Perhaps a refurbished 
model would suit your needs.

   Thanks, Galen. She likes the 15.6" widescreens. Most of the
refurbished/scratch-and-dent ThinkPads have 14" screens.

   Newegg has a Dell Vostro 1540 at a good price. Dell supports linux, and I
found a vendor in South Africa that sells them with linux installed. So
there should not be an issue of putting xubuntu on it here.

   I wonder how much money manufacturers pay to have someone think up names
for their products. They could probably use a password generator to get the
same results at a lower price. :-)

Rich

Rich,

You seem to have settled on getting a new laptop to solve whatever
problem you are having with your old laptop. Since you don't know what
the problem is with the old laptop, a new laptop very well may not
solve the problem.  The main reason I have seen for laptops being slow
is  that they have a finite amount of ram. This ram gets filled with
lots of web pages running tons of javascript and flash, images being
edited, movies being decoded, applications that have memory leaks,
etc. Once the ram gets filled they have to use swap or crash.  Unless
you have a solid state drive, swap is a hard disk. Default laptop
drives run at 5400 rpm, moderately fast ones might run at 7200 rpm.
Hard drives are the bottlenecks in most everyday computer systems and
hard drives on new laptops are not any faster than hard drives on old
laptops.  The only thing you can get on newer laptops that will
improve things over old laptops is more ram, lots more ram, and faster
ram. Since the cpu is not usually the bottleneck, faster cpu's will
not help much.  There is a caveat to all this, if you are doing
something all the time which uses lots of cpu like numerical analysis
or  movie editing, then a faster cpu might help.  Otherwise what you
really want is more ram.  The other problem with laptops is cooling.
There is not much room in there for air circulation and so they
sometimes have loud noisy fans.   In fact if your laptop always stays
sitting on the desk in the same place, a nice desktop computer can be
cooler and  quieter and probably last longer.

Bill

Bill,

   Turns out slowness is the secondary issue; shutting down when the cursor
is moved is the primary issue. I've not seen that happen, but I spend almost
no time on that machine since all I do with it is fix problems that arise
and run the update manager every few weeks.

   Since she spends most of her time on facebook and gmail via Seamonkey I
agree that RAM constipation is most likely the problem. She's also hard on
the machine, wearing off the surface of keys, touchpads, and where her hands
rest on the case by the keyboard. The Toshiba Satellite L455-S5975 is about
3 years old now so I accept that for a low-end portable on sale at Best Buy
then it has a shorter life expectancy than do more expensive machines.

   I just ordered a Toshiba Satellite L755D-S5359 from Newegg. It's the same
line as the current machine, but with more RAM (4G vs. 2G). It has a 5400
RPM hard drive, but with 4G RAM there will be less swapping then with only
2G RAM. I can also make the swap partition larger on the new box. What sold
me is their one reviewer wrote that he installed xubuntu on it and
everything worked with no issues to overcome.

   I'll also download and install Opera to replace Seamonkey. That'll
probably make a difference, too.

   Any other advice on how to set this up considering that Web access is
where she spends 99% of her time will be greatly accepted. I'm always open
to recommendations from those who know hardware better than I do ... that's
almost everyone.

Thanks,

Rich

As if we need reminding?  Especially in the current context...

FWIW - I have Megapath and so far so good.  But Russ Johnson's 
approach to getting a virtual system hosted somewhere is a way around 
the dilemma Rich is facing.  Especially with the short notice he has.

Message-ID: <CAJeYwHf4c2M8rtu9CaDjqosFKfdTMizk02ZsRo_d3999BeG2oQ@mail.gmail.com>

Okay, I admit that I don't understand symbolic links for files.
Here's what I did, I backed up all the files on my Ubuntu Lucid linux
to a backup drive using the commands

rsync -av /folder /backupfolder  or cp -ruvp /folder /backupfolder

This seems to work quite well, with the exception of the /dev and
/proc and /sys folders contents which I guess I don't really care
about anyways.

Here's what happened yesterday.

I erased the files in the /home/me folder on the backup drive, in
preparation to do a "fresh" clean copy onto the backup.

Since I had previously backed up all the folders from / (root) I
decided to get a fresh copy of those folders also to my backup drive,
so I started erasing the file folders on the backup drive starting
with the /bin folder.

Eventually I erased the files in the /lib area on the backup drive.
Okay, no apparent problems.

Then I erased the files in the /lib32 area on the backup drive and
then the /lib64 area, which was a link pointing back to the /lib area.

Suddenly I lost my /sbin and /bin commands.  The whole system became
inoperable and I couldn't do anything at all.  I had to do a manual
reset to reboot, which failed, of course.

I had to rebuild the Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid from scratch and restore all
my files and programs again, which became a 7 hour ordeal.  Needless
to say, this was a painful experience.

Apparently removing the link files on my backup actually removed the
system files and the link files on the backup, leaving nothing on
either drive. (which is exactly an anti-backup)

Questions:

Should I have booted from a CD disk, to safely scrub the files on the
backup drive, then copy from the hard drives to the backup?  Both file
systems would be off line, so it would appear that this might be the
way to go.

Should I be using something different than the "cp -ruvp" and "rsync
-av" commands to do backups?

I really cannot afford to go through another 7 hour re-install again

One more question:

Is there a clear write up or procedure steps of making a CD or DVD
runnable copy of my system, so that I come up on that CD or DVD and
have my system intact (bench-marked at a certain update level) and
then restore to hard drives?  It still took several hours to move from
the Ubuntu install disk to the current update level, and it would be
much more preferable to do a fresh re-install from current update
levels, rather than have to do the laborious updates.

Finally, I won't mind if you say that this was not one of my brightest moves.

A symbolic link is essentially a file that contains the pathname
of another file.  The OS sees the pointer in the link file and
proceeds to act on the target.  The advantage to symbolic links is
that they work between filesystems, which regular hard links
cannot do.  (A hard link is simply a directory entry, so it can't
cross filesystem boundaries.)

This sounds like a typo somewhere.  The ../backupfolder/lib64 link
to ../backupfolder/lib should not have affected your working
system.  I've done that same sort of thing, it's all too easy.

You have my sympathies.  I've had similar experiences.  There's a
reason I do backups every week.  :-)

Removing a symbolic link will have no effect on the target of said
link.  Something else went wrong here.

That shouldn't be necessary, if you've got things set up
correctly.  You need to do that sort of thing for disaster
recovery, but not for regular backups.


> Should I be using something different than the "cp -ruvp" and "rsync
> -av" commands to do backups?

Maybe try "cp --archive", to make sure that all the file
ownerships and permissions are saved.  That said, I would
recommend using dedicated backup software, such as Dirvish
(<http://www.dirvish.org/>), to do your backups.  There is a
package for Ubuntu, I believe.

Dirvish runs from the command line, and uses rsync to copy the
files.  The advantage of Dirvish is that it uses hard links to
essentially "fake" a full backup every time it's run.  Rsync
copies only those files that have changed since the prior backup,
and builds hard links to the rest.  This saves time and space --
especially space.  The downside to Dirvish is that it's not the
simplest software to set up.  You have to read the man pages very
thoroughly.  There are articles on Keith L.'s Dirvish website that
are very helpful.  There is also a Dirvish mailing list that can
be quite helpful.  I run Dirvish myself, to make weekly backups of
all two of my systems.  Call me a very satisfied customer.

Heh.  I know how you feel, trust me.  I've been there.

Anyway, I hope this helps.

Sorry to hear of the unintended consequences of removing a backup.  Don't
you just hate it when things like that happen, I do.  One way to avoid
these consequences in the future would be to use the tar program to create
backup archives.  You would save space and you could then remove the whole
archive without those unexpected consequences.   The downsides are tar will
be slower to back up your system, and it will be less convenient to access
to individual files.  Do "man tar" to get started, then google "tar system
backup"  for lots more information.  Good Luck.

Agreed, it sounds like something went wrong in the deleting step.  Can you 
post the *exact* commands you ran, in the order you ran them, and what 
directory you were in at the time, and what user you were running as?

David

I was manually running the "rm -r * " command

cd /backup/lib
rm -r *
cd ../lib32
rm -r *
cd ../lib64
rm -r *

and then things stopped working at this point

but lib64 was a symbolic link to /lib, I believe, which I believe was 
pointing back to /lib on the main system, not /lib on my backup drive.

I believe that the /backupfolder/lib64 link points to the /lib folder on 
the running system, NOT the /backupfolder/lib area.

This is where I think things went wrong.

The shutdown on cursor movement sounds like a hardware or low level
configuration glitch, however you've already ordered a replacement.

I definitely recommend that you try Firefox 9.0.1 though. It's much
faster than the previous versions of Firefox, rather noticeably so.

Yeah, that sounds likely.  By cd'ing into the link (lib64 -> /lib) you 
moved to /lib, and rm -r *'ed as indicated.

However, if you hadn't cd'ed into the link, the rm would have just removed 
the symbolic link, and not the files in the dir the link points to
(cd /backup; rm -r *).

Or, you could test that the entity you want to cd into is a real 
directory, rather than a link, before doing the cd and remove step
(man test).

Robert,

   Is it more conservative of memory?

   I'll need to learn how to build and install 9.0.1 on a debian-based system
as I doubt that version's in a ubuntu repository.

I have recently converted to LinuxMint due to desktop issues.
I am having a problem with Grub in that when I delete old kernels etc
from /boot after running update-grub
the deleted kernels still show under a submenu "Previous Linux Versions".
I have not been able to figure out where the reference to the old (and
deleted kernels) are.

Any suggestions ?

Bill,

Depending on the version of grub, check  /boot/grub/menu.lst or 
/boot/grub/grub.conf

or in /boot/grub, just do a

grep "Previous Linux Versions" *

I hope this helps.

Lou

If you read my original post, you will see I have the problem AFTER
running update-grub.
Update-grub re-generates /boot/grub/grub.cfg after supposedly scanning
for kernels.
Part of that regen process is controlled out of /etc/default/grub.
I cannot find any references there to "Previous Linux Versions" sub-menu.

I finally resolved the issue.

If you want to remove old Linux kernels from your system:
 * Remove kernel and related files from /boot
 * Remove related linux-headers (directories) from /usr/src
 * Run update-grub

This appears to be true on Ubuntu 11.10 and LinuxMint 11

It is reported to use less memory, yes. I don't know if Mozilla caught
all the memory leaks, but Firefox frees memory more aggressively now:
http://www.webmonkey.com/2011/12/mozilla-unleashes-faster-smaller-firefox-9/
and http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/9.0.1/releasenotes/ .

It doesn't have separate versions for different Linux distributions,
it seems, but the download at http:/www.firefox.com works under Ubuntu
I'm told. I'd suggest that you can download the tar file to /usr/local
then as root, cd /usr/local; untar -xvjf firefox-9.0.1.tar.bz2 .

Good luck!

Were these kernels you installed from non-Debian/non-Ubuntu sources?
As in, did you download the source from kernel.org and compile it
yourself?

If you installed them through the package manager, or compiled a
custom kernel with make-kpkg, then you should uninstall the kernel
image/header packages as appropriate rather than just deleting files
directly.

This turned out to be the best approach. All I needed to discover was 
the -sameq option to ffmpeg, which preserves the quality level of the 
original video.

Thanks for the replies,

I ended up with an APC BE550G from Amazon.

It came yesterday so I plugged it in and let it charge up overnight. 
This morning I plugged my computer and monitors into it and this 
afternoon I have Googled and found I can install apcupsd via Synaptic. I 
also installed the GUI monitor gapcmon.

For instructions I used:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/apcupsd

It helpfully told me a few things I needed to change in a couple of 
files. But it left out an important step: how to start the daemon. I 
took a guess that it was "sudo apcupsd start" and learned I was correct.

I confirmed that apcupsd exists in /etc/init.d. Am I correct in assuming 
that apcupsd will start every time the machine boots?

Thanks for all the support.

You should test the setup by pulling the plug on the UPS and making
sure that everything shuts down correctly.

Thanks. I'll do that. (saved to drafts)

Test complete and successful.

Good point. I didn't have anything open that needed saving, but good 
point anyway.


The only thing I'm not sure of -- which I'll check another time -- is 
whether apcupsd actually started. I think it did, but the way I went 
looking was to start up the monitor. I showed something was starting but 
I'm not sure if it meant that the monitor was starting or the daemon was 
starting. Next time I'll run "ps ax | grep apcupsd" before running the 
monitor.

Anyway, I'm happy with the way it works. I watched a clean shut down 
after about 8 minutes or so. It started out with 11 plus minutes and 
shut down around 4 plus something minutes. That should give me more than 
enough time to save and close things when I'm sitting here. And I'm 
usually good about saving before walking away from the desk so that 
shouldn't be a problem.

Thanks again for the ideas.

Here's my quick shopping summary.  This is based on wanting to replace
a Spiritone/Frontier DSL connection.  This is a 3M/768k connection
with a static IP that costs us ~$51/month based on a one year
commitment.  Note that this is for a business, so some vendors won't
sell us a residential package.  For Comcast and Frontier, I didn't
even look at residential because I don't want ports blocked.

DSL Only/DSL Northwest:  3M/768k, SOHO w 4 static IPs, $89/month, got
conflicting answers as to whether DSL is supported on dry pair

Spiretech: 3M/768k, residential w dynamic IP administered by
Spiretech("won't change"), modem or router must authenticate(PPPOA),
DSL over dry pair supported, $60/month

Megapath: 3M/768k, multiple static IPs, DSL over dry pair, $99/month

Infinity: 3M/768k, SOHO w 4 static IPs, DSL over dry pair?, $92/month

Comcast business: 12M/2M w 1 static IP, $83/month, estimate from web site

Frontier business:
  3M/768k, static IP, DSL over dry pair?, $80/month
  25M/25M, static IP, $110/month
  15M/5M, dynamic IP, $70/month


If there are other providers I should look at, please let me know.

Given the short notice from Spiritone(by design?), I suspect I will
stick with Spiritone for the time being, and try to get dynamic DNS
updates working.  I have doubts as to whether I would be able to get a
new connection installed before the Spiritone change.  OTOH, I've
asked Spiritone about the timing of the switchover and have yet to
hear back.  It will be 'interesting' to see how they go about making
this change.

subscription to them. I _think_ that will be a stop-gap measure to buy me
more time with the SpiritOne change.

   I, too, have 3M/768K ADSL speeds here in my home-based business office.
Any and all advice, suggestions, and recommendations will certainly be taken
'cause you folks know much more about these WAN issues than do I.

Rich,
Namecheap has their own dynamic dns. You don't need or want dyndns'
services. This is  documented on their website.

Bill,

   That's right! Now I remember reading something about this. I've not before
had need to set up and run a DNS server (only a local DNS cache) so I'm
feeling my way along.

   No dynDNS for me, then.

Many thanks,

Rich

Also you don't need to use namecheap as your registrar in order to use
their freedns service.

if you do choose switch domains from Godaddy to Namecheap and you are using
Godaddy's nameservers, then it is best to switch nameservers to namecheap
first, then transfer the domains. As soon as you start the domain transfer
Godaddy drops you from their nameservers before the domain is fully
transferred which will cause you trouble.

Bill,

   Excellent advice; I'll do this. Afterwards, I'll need to get godaddy to
refund 51 months of the 60 month renewal I paid for last June. I'm sure that
will be an interesting discussion. My business domain registration at
DomainDiscover expires in March so I'll not worry about 2 month's fee.

Much grasses,

Rich

EULA doesn't allow you to run your own web server.  If that's important.
Not sure about other service prohibitions.

Are you sure about this?  I can't find the EULA on their web site, but 
this page certainly suggests that running a server is acceptable.

>From their FAQ:

A Static IP will allow you to assign your own server or firewall with a public static-routable IP. For example, you
could run an e-mail, Web, or VPN server. Learn more about Static IP

e-mail, Web, or VPN is pretty clear.

I'll let you know how it works out when I call them.

http://business.comcast.com/smb/terms-conditions

    The Service cannot be used to run servers unless you have selected
    a Service plan which includes a static or statically assigned IP
    address.

    If you have selected a Service plan with a static or statically
    assigned IP address, the Service can be used to host a public
    website.

... so if you pop for the $15/month they charge for a static IP, you
should be okay.

However, if you take their TOS use of the word "anyone" literally,
unless you have written approval from Comcast, no one on or off your
premises can use the service!

   The Service cannot be [...] made available to anyone on the
   Premises or outside the Premises [...], directly or indirectly,
   unless done with written approval in accordance with an applicable
   Service plan.

This is the kind of crap that makes Comcast repulsive.  They love your
money, but they hate you.  The bitter reality is that they have about
the only decent infrastructure in Portland obtainable for less than a
few kilodollars/month.

If it was me (and I was out in the 'burbs), I'd go the 25/25 route
from Frontier, just because they deliver it on glass, and that sort of
thing should be encouraged.

Taken out of context, it sure looks ominous. What it really means is you can rent, sell, or give away the service to others, other than those they know about in your service agreement. So you can't give it away to another business, but you can give it to all your employees. The contract you sign will specify who you can give it to. They are just saying you can't give it to anyone else.

The literal words they use are so broad, that virtually any use you
can imagine *might* fit within their language of prohibited
activities.  There are many unsophisticated businesses that purchase
their service for which the only plausible purpose is to "give it
away" to their customers, and Comcast continues to happily cash their
checks.

What you are left with is a pervasive pattern of technical violation
allowed for as long as it is financially convenient to the carrier.
But if for any reason they decide they don't like you or what you are
doing, they have immediately available grounds for terminating your
service with prejudice.

It's a completely wonderful model ... if you are Comcast.


PS: $15/month for a static IP?  sheesh!  Can you say, "yippee! we don't
have any competition!"?

Subject: [PLUG] Asterisk - echo with cisco 79xx handsets
Message-ID: <20120111091402.GA25491@gate.kl-ic.com>

Thanks everybody for the help so far on Asterisk issues.
Here's what has helped:

1) The wiring from T.P.C. was going through a dogs breakfast
of cables and coupling blocks.  I replaced all that with
a 66 punchdown block and a few appropriate length cables.
That got rid of some noise, which helps with echo training.

Why noise?  Every time you have a non-gas-tight connection,
here in moist Oregon, you get corrosion, which acts like a
series of tiny short-duration batteries. That is, voltage
pulses added to the circuit, and noise.  

2) I had a couple of analog phones acting as "emergency
backups" plugged into the lines in parallel with the
Asterisk FXO cards.  Unplugging those also reduced noise,
and I will add some switches to turn them on in case of
power failures.

3) fxotune helps.  Thanks for the clue.

4) I appreciate the suggestion of Digium's HPEC, and may end
up using it, but it seems that the Kool Kids are using the
open source "oslec" echo canceller instead of the default mg2.
I haven't managed to get this to compile and load properly yet, 
but eventually it will fall to the mighty hammer of "googling
for error messages".  Hindered but not stopped by the name 
migration from zaptel/zapata to dahdi.

----

BTW, one of the things I hoped to connect was an LED kludge
I built that lights up when a line rings - that was our way
of letting the assistant know to put the current caller on
hold and pick up the other line, since the call-waiting 
indication on the Cisco phones is too subtle.

I designed the kludge for the standard voltages from T.P.C.
+50 volts on hook,  25 Hz and 300 volts (+200V/-100V), 
peak-to-peak for ringing.  Sadly, the wimpy little FXS
cards I have produce 50 volts on hook as before, but the
ring signal is only 130V p-p, (+65V/-65V).  I can rewire
the LED stack for the lower voltage, but it will draw too
many ringer equivalents if I plug it in to T.P.C.again.
If anyone else has an Asterisk system with FXS cards
connected to analog phone desksets, perhaps I can bring
my oscilloscope over and measure those, and see if it
is my cheap cards or (more likely) this is non-standard
behavior that started with the first zapata designs.

Others have mentioned using offsite servers;  I use two, one
from Rimuhosting and one from Linode.  I drill VPNs to them
for email and backups.  That means I do not need routable IP
addresses for my own machines, and if I turn off the VPNs
I am more immune to attack.  

The major disadvantage is the extra cost, but it is only
a bit more than the static IP cost from most ISPs.  One
advantage/disadvantage is that my servers have ?ber-bandwidth.
They can talk to each other (Dallas to Fremont) at gigabit
speeds.  However, if they get slashdotted, I go through my
monthly bandwidth allotment in a few minutes. 

Perhaps a few of you can share an offsite virtual server,
running multiple URLs and virtual servers for your websites,
divving up incoming and outgoing mail, etc.  That would
reduce the expense and share the maintenance burden, 
though it would mean finding trustworthy "disk-mates".

Regards static IP to the home, your /16 is probably shared
with a lot of home windows machines.  Many of those are Pwned,
and spewing spam, so your whole digital neighborhood may get 
blacklisted by some big email services with sloppy spam
filtering policies.   

Also, we are nearing the end of the IPV4 age.  Static
addresses /should/ be expensive - they need to be reused
and not just sat on.  With IPV6 becoming the only way 
the internet can expand, I suspect ISPs will someday offer
free static /64 subnets to anyone willing to give up their
single dynamic IPV4 address (to resell in China).

I invite all of you to do a whois on 199.88.144.0:

    whois -H 199.88.144.0 | less

It's still sitting.  Unused, unroutable, and I've never

gandi.net offers hosting with unlimited bandwidth.  Your 
data rate is constrained based on the plan you choose.
But you can serve up as much stuff as your pipe will carry.

The VMs are all XEN hosted.

Message-ID: <4F0DAD8F.2050501@pcnetinc.com>

I'm not literally moving in one step from CP/M to Linux.
BUT, I think that may describe a needed change in mindset.

I've spent a year lurking on several Linux related groups 
and browsing untold Linux related sites with emphasis on 
Debian and Ubuntu related pages. I have a 6 year old copy of 
_A Practical Guide to Red Hat Linux_ by Sobel and have just 
downloaded a pdf of _Slackware Linux Essentials_ .

What has all this accomplished?
Demonstrate that I'm missing some underlying concept(s) 
common to all UNIX variants/derivatives.

I suspect that what I'm looking for would run 3,000 to 
30,000 words.

I started to get more specific an found I'd just muddy the 
waters.

TIA

Richard,

   I'll say! I've not used CP/M since the late 1970s.

   As I was told years ago, linux tools are easy to understand. The catch is
that there are thousands of tools.

   The ubuntus are highly GUI oriented and appeal to those raised on
Microsoft; they also hide a lot from the user; somewhat like a black box
that 'just works.'

   Red Hat, Slackware, and Debian are (or can be) more command line oriented
and similar in that regard to CP/M. You need to learn more about what's
going on under the hood. What you gain from this is a better understanding
of how things work and more control so you can make the system do as you
like, fix things that break, and better understand your tool.

   Years ago I had an introduction to linux book that explained the
underlying concepts. There are probably good resources on the Web.

   Start with understanding a system: kernel, tools, editors, etc. before
moving on to networking. Lots of good help here.

Have you built or bought a Linux PC yet?  FreeGeek sells PCs running Ubuntu
Linux, and it's very easy to install the major distros like CentOS, Fedora
or Ubuntu (my favorite) on your own PC or VM.

Near Springfield MO, apparently.  A bit of googling revealed
this thread from April 2011:

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/groups/south-west-missouri-linux-users-group/

Apparently "amsweitzer", about 30 miles west of Richard
in Lawrence County, is talking about setting up "SWMLUG"
... which I suppose could double as "Single White Male",
an amply represented portion of our community.

Windows comes out of a box, linux comes out of a community. 
One of the best parts of Linux is hanging out with other
Linux users, swapping CDs and hardware and lies.  While
some of us are quite happy being Moody Loners with
Keyboards, it can be fun to sit down in pairs or threes
and attack problems together.  Sometimes it is essential;
if your only computer is hosed, how do you google for 
repair ideas?  Much easier with helpful friends.

Richard is certainly welcome on this list, and there are
a few ancient CP/M geeks on it.  Another Portland CP/M
geek, Jim Willing, moved to Yates Center, KS, to run a
bowling alley.  Perhaps Jim is still around, and ready
to drive two hours east for SWMLUG.

I suggest Richard picks a distro that offers both "texty"
and "gui" ways to get things done.  Do the config with
the gui, in the beginning.  Then see what files the gui
changes.  That gives two views of the same information.

Avoid like the plague any distro that keeps configuration
in non-standard files, filters them through a GUI, to 
make write-only linux configs.   There are a very few
files like that in Redhat distros, more in some of the
oddball "user friendly" distros.
      
Ubuntu is a good way to get started.  The community is
helpful and welcoming of newbies.  After that, the various
clones of Redhat Enterprise are interesting, mostly because
CentOS is the engine underneath so many application specific
distros - a lot of production software ported to CentOS.
After that, if Richard is feeling ubergeeky, skip Debian
and others and go straight to Gentoo - build your own
binaries from source.  Unless  Richard wants to go all
the way to programming with solder.  Starting out with
RHEL/CentOS is like learning to drive on a bulldozer.

Hey, don't knock it... that was exactly the move I made in 1992 or so :-)

CP/M (and later, MP/M) was the bomb compared to MS-DOS...

I'll drop out of lurk mode for the moment to point out that Jim Willing and I started the CP/M User's Group back in 1980.

We flipped a coin to see who would be President - he won and was member #0 and I was member #1 and Librarian (I even had a rubber stamp made up with a skull and crossbones that said, "Bootleg Copy - Do Not Distribute". We of course did not actually distribute any bootleg copies of anything of course. Heh.

In many ways, I think the CP/M-UG NW (or whatever the hell it ended up being called - it all runs together after awhile) was sort of the precursor to this group. A bunch of wonderful folks trying to help each other, despite differences in politics or distros.

Back to lurk mode,

I hope what they meant was they would send notices to customers a 
week BEFORE their conversion....

What they told me today was

"We are still finalizing the details, and hope to have our 
 test-migrations completed by the end of this week. We expect to be 
 moving forward with customer batch migrations starting next Monday."

In .pinerc, it's set via the incoming-folders directive, e.g.,

   "PLUG" {mail.you.com/user=yourusername/ssl}mailinglists.plug

Where PLUG is the nickname.

Subject: [PLUG] css user group?
Message-ID: <4F0F1736.507@comcast.net>

Any recommendations for a user group discussing css?

Here's the question I want to post to one of those forums:

I'm trying to create a web page with an image and a navigation bar that 
are fixed followed by content that can scroll "under" the image and 
navigation bar. I have succeeded with that. I also want all of that 
centered in the browser window with a background color all around 
everything. I have succeeded with that, too, except that when something 
in the div with the main content is long enough to scroll, it shows up 
above the image and navigation bar. Is there some way to hide that other 
than creating an image of a solid color matching that of the body color 
and putting that before the image?

Structure is as follows:

<body>
<div id="container">
<div id="sitemast"></div>
<div id="navbar"></div>
<div id="main"></div>
</div> /* container */
</body>

css is as follows:

* {
   margin: 0;
   padding: 0;
   }

body {
   background: #000080; /* navy */
   margin:0;
   padding: 0 0 100px 0; /* to have a bottom "border" */
   }

#container {
   position: relative;
   top: 30px;
   margin: 0 auto;
   width: 800px;
   background: #ffffff;
   }

#sitemast {
   height: 150px; /* height of image */
   width: 800px;
   background: url(images/tetons.jpg) no-repeat;
   color: white;
   }

#navbar {
   width: 800px;
   height: 18px;
   margin: 0;
   background: #87CEFA; /* LightSkyBlue */
   }

#main {
   padding: 1em;
   }



Thanks for ideas about the problem or another suitable forum.

Subject: [PLUG] USB foot pedal quit working after installing apcupsd
Message-ID: <4F0F21AF.50106@comcast.net>

This morning is the first time since installing the new battery backup 
and apcupsd that I've tried to use my USB foot pedal (which controls 
Rewind / Play / Fast Forward for my transcription program). I remember 
creating udev rules for the foot pedal so that permissions would be 
correctly set on boot:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="*05f3*", MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="*05f3*", MODE="0666"

But this morning when I loaded the program footpedal I got the error 
message I used to get telling me that I needed to:

rsteff at moonguide:~$ sudo chmod a+r /dev/usb/hiddev0^C

After running the above the footpedal program loaded. But it does not 
control the transcribe program the way it should. I can start and stop 
the transcribe program with its own gui controls but not with the foot 
pedal.

The only thing that comes to mind that has changed is the addition of 
the USB connection to the APC battery backup.

What tool do I use to start figuring out how to correct this problem?

Thanks.

Galen,

   Yesterday I created a namecheap.com account and moved the DNS servers for
my two domains to theirs. Today I started the process of transferring my two
domains to them (the business domain from DomainDiscover, the personal
domain from godaddy). Namecheap.com provides free dynamic DNS serverices so
dynDNS is not needed.

   Bill Barry sent me a cron script he uses to check whether his IP address
has changed; it runs every 5 minutes. If the address does change, the new
one is entered in his router.

   In my naivete, I think this overcomes the SpiritOne/Frontier DSL issue. Is
that correct? When I'm in a hotel whose nameserver cannot resolve my address
by name I can use the current IP address that I obtained with 'host' and
store in a text file in ~/. What's your thoughts?

Thanks,

Rich

Small correction, it updates the Namecheap nameservers with the new IP address.

Using Synaptic I removed apcupsd and the associated gui monitor, shut 
down the machine, removed the usb cable connecting the machine to the 
battery backup, and rebooted. The footpedal program started without my 
needing to correct its permissions, and it works with transcribe.

I've gone for many years without an automated shut down on power fail so 
I'm not too concerned about it.

I discovered the program udevadm and tried

sudo udevadm info --export-db > udevdb.txt

That gave me TMI, but I was able to locate information about the usb two 
devices I had connected, the VEC foot pedal and the APC foot switch. But 
I wasn't able to interpret the rest of the information sufficiently to 
see where the difficulty lay. If anyone sees something useful below that 
could help me figure out how to get both devices working at the same 
time I'd appreciate it.

Here's what I extracted from udevdb.txt:

galen,

   Interesting. Yesterday 'whois 216.99.206.23' showed my company in the
result. Today it shows Spirit One. Yet 'host appl-ecosys.com' still shows
216.99.206.23.

   Ah so. Thank you. That makes more sense.

   I've spent a lot of today futzing with changing registrars. It all blurs

 host 216.99.206.23  still returns
23.206.99.216.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer appl-ecosys.com.

I suspect that will change when they make the switch to dynamic IP's

That's not
surprising considering their stated intent to move everyone to dynamic IPs.


Many hostnames can resolve to one IP, yet each IP only reverse
resolves to one hostname.

domaindiscover I finally have registrars and DNS nameservers straightened
out. I share the information in case others are interested in making the
move.

   The key is namecheap's freeDNS servers are only for those for whom the
company is _not_ the domain registrar. As soon as the domain is transferred
(and domaindiscover did so immediately), namecheap moves the domain to their
regular nameservers: dns1-5.registrar-servers.com. Same features as
freedns1-5.registrar-servers.com, but only for the domains they host.

   All three companies must be running Microsoft because their Web sites are
flaky, work with Opera but not firefox-3.6.22, and keep having me re-log in
each time I navigate to a new page. PITA!

   So, now I have a single registrar (but will probably lose the $27 and
change paid to GoDaddy last June and not used for the remaining 51 months on
that renewal), and all DNS nameservers at namecheap.

   If the script for the cron job updates the DNS servers when the IP address
changes, and that does not negatively impact postfix, httpd, proftpd, and
sshd, then I suppose there's no reason to leave Spirit1 as an ISP. Their
price for the 3M/768K (the maximum I can get at since I'm apparently near
the end of the wire out here) is less than anyone else's and access to the
'Net is a fungible commodity utility as far as I'm concerned since I use no
other ISP services. So low price wins.

   Is my reasoning off anywhere here?

I have everything working with oslec now.  I had to drop back 
to dahdi 2.3.0.1 (I was at 2.5.0.2), and the best instructions
were here:

http://www.bsmdev.com/Reference/Tech_20100001.html

There was two issues with the instructions.
When I rebuilt dahdi and started up, I got two error messages:

   Unrecognized garbage 'Reserved' in WCTDM/0/2
   ...

and 

   Running dahdi_cfg:  DAHDI_ATTACH_ECHOCAN failed on channel 1: Invalid argument (22)
                                                           [FAILED]

The first warning message was resolved by copying the newer version 
of /usr/local/share/perl5/Dahdi/Chans.pm  from the 2.5.0.3 source.
It wasn't serious, but it was ugly.  I don't have daughter cards on
on all the slots on the TDM800 card, and it /whines/ about it.

The second hard error was fixed by adding "dahdi_echocan_oslec"
in front of the configured "wctdm24xxp" in /etc/dahdi/modules.
Basically, the error message occurs because it does not know 
how to autoload oslec.


It would be nice to find an updated version of the instructions
that work with the very latest 2.6.* dahdi, but perhaps that
should wait until the "echo" code gets out of staging and into
the main kernel, in which case the dahdi code won't need patching.
If there are any decent kernel hackers reading this, they might
take care of the pending issues on that code and work with 
Greg K-H to accept it.

In any case, oslec is very nice ( imagine the French soldier 
from "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" rasping "vehhuh naahs")

Thanks again for the help.  I hope this message finds its way
to other struggling oslec users.

January 15 - 3rd Sunday - is Linux Clinic.  If you are still
waiting on hold to your phone or cable or internet provider
at 1pm on Sunday, HANG UP and join us at Free Geek at 1731
Southeast 10th Avenue (about 3 blocks south of Hawthorne).

Our highly trained (guaranteed more than one hour) Linux
experts may spend most of the time assisting other customers,
but we PROMISE there will be NO ANNOYING RECORDINGS trying
to sell you MORE services we have no intention to support.
At least you can surf the web without being interrupted by
telemarketers.

Instead of annoying, upbeat robot advertisements, we have
keyboards, mice, and monitors, wired and wireless internet.
We have many Linux Distros suitable for your ancient or
modern hardware.  We have poor jokes, rude videos, coffee
and snacks, and very occasionally, a clue.

Bring your laptop, bring your CPU box, bring your frustration
with stupid documentation and obscure configuration files and
Nigerian/Russian/Nevada spam, and we can jump up and down
screaming together.  Afterwards, we can work together fixing
your problems, revealing new problems we can work on in February.  

Or you can stay on hold.  They might answer your call in March.

   Considering that Nevada has two major	industries designed to screw

"Canned meat?"  That may be one way Nevada industry
makes personnel problems go away.

Regards Unsolicited Commercial Email, much of it
does originate from Nevada.  They make political
contributions to the right politicians, and the FBI
leaves them alone.  Which you find out when you track
UCE to the source, and try to get the Powers That Be
to do something.  If you persist, see paragraph (1).

Wire, concrete blocks, and Lake Mead might be preferable.
That happened to a friend.  I don't like Nevada much. 
On the other hand, better there than here.

This should probably move to plug-talk.

Sounds reasonable to me, although if a given connection's nameserver
is down, it's likely that other stuff is broken too.  Given what we've
heard from Spiritone, it sounds as if changes to the assigned IP will
be very rare.

I've never used dynamic DNS before, but obviously many people do.  My
current plan is to install the latest version of openwrt on my router
and use the ddns-scripts package to update DNS.  We use easyDNS.com
for DNS hosting.  They support dynamic DNS, so hopefully it will just
require a little tweaking to switch over to a dynamic DNS setup.

hmmmmmmmmmmmmm..........

ok, if you haven't read the previous comments (below) about Linux Clinic
Sunday January 15, Please do so now.........


hmmmmmmmm..........


Sorry, I can't help myself .........   ;-0

Is this a hint that more people would come to the Linux Clinic if we tried
to follow the example set by Nevada?     (at least in one area)

Since there are usually more males than females present, perhaps such an
offer would bring more women through the door?


Just thinking.............    :-)

True reconciliation is never cheap, for it is based on forgiveness, which
is costly. Forgiveness in turn depends on repentance, which has to be
based on an acknowledgment of what was done wrong, and therefore on
disclosure of the truth. You cannot forgive what you do not know.

Message-ID: <20120114030816.GB2286@gate.kl-ic.com>

This being the Portland Linux/Unix group, I will share a tidbit
about the "other" Unix machine, the Mac.  We bought a used Mac
Mini for the office assistant;  she is scared of Linux (for now),
and I would rather maintain a Mac than a Windoze box. 

I am slogging through 650 pages of "Learn Mac OSX Snow Leopard"
so I can answer her questions and maintain the darned thing. 
Appendix C lists "Our Favorite Applications", with the prices
at the time of writing.   Almost all have usable Free Software
equivalents, i.e. BBedit -> (vim, emacs, etc).  So while the
book is good to mention a number of free programs, buying all
their proprietary favorites would set you back over $6000 .
Yikes!

In the Mac's favor, most free software has been ported to it.
So I can stull run vim and Libre Office and Gimp and Firefox
and all that other good stuff.

I am also struck by all of the propeller-(x) keyboard shortcuts.
I suppose a Mac-only person will eventually remember all these, 
just as some of us remember the control-(x) shortcuts for open
source programs.  It is nice that a user can remember one set
of shortcuts that work for everybody's proprietary Mac programs.
But in return for this comfortable uniformity, Mac users go
without a lot of the oddments that open source hackers kludge
up their software with.  50% of the oddments are silly, but
the other 50% can become essential. 

I haven't got to the programming chapters of the book - perhaps
there are some Really Easy ways (that is, five minutes of work)
to wedge open source apps into the Mac paradigm.  Doubtful.

Overall, a Mac seems like a good computer for people with lots
of money who prefer a slowly evolving curated experience to a
customized experience with niche apps.  These days, with any
platform, all you really need is a decent web browser and the
right sort of web apps, worldwide and local.  In a few years,
it won't matter what machine is her desk, as long as I can
provide the right local web apps.  Back to work on those.

So why would one want to buy "all their" favorites, proprietary or not?  
And what would the total be for the necessary?  What is necessary that

As a mac convert for several years, I'd like to comment. These are my thoughts only. I also maintain linux boxes for a living. I use a mac as my desktop machine purely by choice.

Good choice. :)

I would suggest google as an alternative. Almost every question I've ever had about OS/X or the hardware I've been able to answer with a google query.

Maintenance is mostly automatic. It will tell you when there are updates, or if you prefer, you can subscribe to various rss feeds that will tell you when an update comes out. 

> Appendix C lists "Our Favorite Applications", with the prices
> at the time of writing.

Assuming it's the same book from Apress I found on Amazon, I'm assuming that's the authors favorites. If you ask 10 Mac users, you'll get 5 to 10 different answers. The same as with Linux. When I want a program to do a specific task, I usually start with www.macupdate.com. It's a great repository. It lists FOSS, shareware and commercial programs.

Check out macports.

I suspect the Apple key is where the Windows key came from. It's been around years longer.

I have perl, php, gcc and python installed on my mac. Macports will get you almost everything you can get on your linux box. 

Part of my requirements for my laptop is that 'it just works'. If I have to futz with it, ever, then I'm not doing my job nor my boss any good. OS/X gives me that more than any other OS ever has. Yes, there was a learning curve, but now that the learning curve is mostly over, I'm more productive, and have fewer issues than either Windows or Linux gave me.

This will be a response to the points raised in the replies 
so far.

Command line usage and the number of tools available is no 
particular problem. As far as mindset it's just CP/M or DOS 
with a different vocabulary/syntax.

I think the key thing I'm missing is understanding just what 
are distributions and dependencies. In the old days you 
wrote a program that compiled/linked/loaded ALL needed code 
into a single executable that the OS fetched and loaded. 
Later came precompiled libraries that could be loaded during 
execution e.g. DLL's. Now Linux has Something _Better(tm). 
Just what Something _Better is remains undefined.

Another question (related???); "What is a LIVE edition?" Not 
why needed or how to use, but how is it constructed? There 
must be something "standard" as I've noticed references to 
tools that can make a "Live CD" from a running configuration.

I've downloaded a bunch of Live CDs and gathered an idea of 
what I like. I'm leaning towards Debian or Slackware. They 
both have software I want and I like what I see in a couple 
of Slacware based Live distros. Ubuntu (as a specific distro 
or perhaps as an an example of a class) loses as it crams 
down my throat what it thinks I must use and does not give 
some that is an absolute necessity - eg connect to internet 
via dial up modem.

   Slot machines would be OK as long as they're not the obnoxious "Wheel of
Fortune" variety. These are common in supermarkets and convenience stores
throughout northern Nevada and could help financially support Free Geek and
PLUG.

   Distributions are linux with different administrative approaches (CLI vs.
GUI, for example), different included applications, and so on. Just like
different brands of pick up trucks: they all do the same thing but look
different and have different trim packages.

   Dependencies are most often libraries that are needed for a particular
application. No need for the applicatoin developer to re-invent the user
interface when an existing one can be incorporated. Same with printing
cababilies, use of periferal hardware such as optical drives, and other
components. The linux/UNIX equivalent of .dlls are shared libraries, .so. If
you look in /usr/lib/ or /lib/ you'll see both .a and .so files. The former
are static, the latter dynamic. The dynamic libraries can be used
simultaneiously by multiple applications.

   When the CD/DVD is created it contains a boot loader that allows the
computer in which it's place to boot the OS from the optical drive. If you
download a distribution you can usually find a version with the .iso
extension. This means that it will produce a bootable disk when burned to
the plastic.

I snaked my way through the various links to find out what Ubuntu User Days
is, and how to partake.  The schedule has links to an explanation of the
meaning of UTC, and bios. of the presenters, but little else.  I finally
ended up with a link to a map (from the calendar for Learning Events),
which yielded, in part:

 We could not understand the location *irc.freenode.net*

Suggestions:

   - Make sure all street and city names are spelled correctly.
   - Make sure your address includes a city and state.
   - Try entering a zip code.

(I have no idea why a link to a physical map is offered for an IRC event.)

I have had no previous exposure to IRC. so I am lost.  I need
some whacks with a clue stick.

Denis,

I am also new to IRC.  To start you need something like XChat.  Once 
installed you need to register an alias with a password.  That took some 
doing to find an alias not already in use.  Then you log into freenode.  
Use the command "/msg nickserv identify <your password>" (without the 
quotes or < >) in the space at the bottom of the page.  Then use the 
command /join #ubuntu-classroom.  If all goes well, you will be 
following the conversation.  David is teaching on Unity lenses as I type.

HTH,

Bruce

What is the least expensive longterm (1-3 years) manner to continuously
play background music or sound?

As posed, the question CANNOT be answered.
Will the music be played in a one room apartment or Mall of 
America?
Will one song be played repeatedly?
Should "Jingle Bells" be played in both June and December?
How to allocate so called 'capital costs'?
If human intervention is regularly required, what is its 
cash cost?
   If you do intervention, what is your time worth?
etc ;)

If you have a collection of digital music/sounds somewhere on your
filesystem say ~/Music then mplayer -shuffle ~/Music will randomly
play stuff from ~/Music

I stream internet radio stations through my computers. At home I use my
desktop computer. Away from home I can do it on my laptop, and I can
easily demonstrate it at the Clinic.

The advantage of streaming internet radio stations is that you have
literally hundreds to choose from. The disadvantage is that you need a
net connection, and occasionally you lose the connection. Depending on
the station you may disconnect once per hour or once every couple of
weeks. I usually stream KQAC (local), but I also frequently stream
Radio Classique (Paris), KUSC (Los Angeles), Swiss Classic (Bern), and
ABC Classic (Melbourne), and I have book marks in Rhythmbox for dozens
more. If I get disconnected it just takes a mouse click to reconnect.

That's important. I'll tell you a story, because history deserves to
be told. But then history is old news, so stop reading if you do not care.

Just less than 25 years ago I drove to Southern California, with one
of those Compaq 'portable' PCs in the back of my Mazda RX7, headed
down to Orange County to replace its property tax system, due to
Proposition 13.

I was an IBM mainframe systems programmer at the time, a member of
that priesthood. I'll gloss over that Orange County work, but I
survived it, and the takeover of Arthur Young by Ernst and Whinney in
1990, somehow.

I'd bought a Zenith 12Mhz 386 portable PC, and I was the first one
that had his own PC at Ernst & Young on the west coast. I put OS/2 on
it and set up dual boot with a Windows partition, an OS/2 partition
and shared a data partition. OS/2 'just worked' and I avoided Windows
crashes that plagued my peers. Thus I was more productive and I got a
lot more work.

In the early '90s an E&Y government practice in Dallas TX got itself
in a bind and I was flown in to get a dozen huge Excel spreadsheets to
run under OS/2, because Microsoft Windows couldn't handle that memory
load.

I kept using OS/2 through about the year 2000, and I even hacked Lotus
Notes to let me do that, after IBM dropped support for it, those
swine. And no, I didn't mention that when I worked for IBM shortly
thereafter.

I could tell you many more stories, from 9600 baud access to
mainframes through $100 per CPU-second charges and executive
malfeasance and other things, however my real point here is that what
you use had better work.

Whatever you use when you're on the road, it had better work. There
are no excuses. Whether that's Linux or a Mac is up to you, but it's
damned sure not Windows. I think IT professionals know this by now and
it will become more and more well known among the population at large.
We might hope so, anyway, and we should be doing all we can to make it
accepted.

Best regards to all,
Robert

Hell, let Free Geek get a liquor license and put in the State of
Oregon video poker machines. I hear those make each bar about $100k
every year.

I'm all in favor of fleecing the innumerate, having tried to talk a
few out of their addiction to no avail. So screw 'em, they're

Or, if we have ethics, maybe not.

Hmm, wonder what it would take to install them in my house?

On a more serious note, I agree that the lottery is a tax on those who
can't do math. Yet I buy a Powerball ticket once in a while. Why?
Of course I lose money in the long run. But my losses are used by the
state for education and job creation. I don't figure it's money lost.
Plus I get a kick out of checking my numbers.

what are you playing it on?  a phone line?  headphones?  a PA system at a mall?
what requirements are there?  how small should the solution be?  how
much are you concerned or willing to pay to ensure that it never
fails?  if it does fail, will it be somewhere you can tell someone to
hit a reset switch easily (ie not in the ceiling or a remote
location)?  do you need to be able to update the sound ever?  does it
need a physical volume control?

seems like the cheapest with no other special requirements would be
just to find a free old computer from craigslist or maybe one that's
too wimpy for freegeek's standards but would be overkill for looping
sound (as would be anything that runs linux and has an audio out).
install read-only filesystems & a stripped down linux setup to do
nothing but loop the track on repeat at boot so it survives power
failures.  i used to work at a place that had a 386 laptop playing its
hold music (closed, sitting in the phone closet, plugged in) for
nearly 10 years straight.

if i were doing it, i'd maybe go for simplest & out of the box "just
works" factor and deprioritize linux and could probably find (for
free) an old hardware mp3 player with 64MB or other
laughably-small-by-today's-standards storage that runs off of a wall
wart instead of batteries and have it loop an mp3.  i used to own more
than one of those.  heck, i still have one of those though it has a
hard drive so it would suck more power than one without spinning disk.

Message-ID: <4F137ACB.1010806@ubuntu.com>

Hello Everyone,

As the release of Ubuntu 12.04 is getting closer I would like to 
initiative planning for the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Release Party. In order to 
create an event that is inclusive I would like to try and guage 
everyone's availability.

I anticipate that April 28th or May 5th would be the most ideal days for 
our release party but of course this is up to discussion. I have created 
a Doodle poll so that people interested in participating in the release 
party can share their availability on those dates that way we have an 
idea of what is going to work best.

Please fill your availability here: http://j.mp/PrecisePlanning

In addition to finding a workable date and time we will also need a 
venue and hopefully some sponsors for food and beverage and as such I 
will be sending out some pitches or better yet requests for sponsorship 
over the next week and when I get enough responses we can decide on 
venue. If you know of any large venues or companies interested in 
sponsoring food or beverage for the release party do not hesitate to get 
in touch with me.

As usual the Release Party will be held in the Portland-Metro area to 
accommodate the greatest amount of attendees and we encourage those who 
have never been to a release party to consider coming and I'm hoping 
that people from OSU LUG/OSU OSL, PLUG, FreeGeek and of course Canonical 
will join us!

Some terminal apps have a reset available from one of the drop-down

Terminal

+1.

there is a small class of things that typing into a shell "echo
control-v control-o" (where c-v and c-o are key combos, not literal)
will fix that reset won't.  past that you can try another startx from
a shell to fix it too (even if you can't read it, you can often still
run commands and login/out).

Message-ID: <20120116043306.GA12331@gate.kl-ic.com>

Doing some sysadmin on my wife's work computer.  scp'ed some
files from another machine - and put an extra space in the wrong
place.  No visible damage, except all of a sudden, all the
commands stopped working in the "keithl" windows.  I had an
open root window (bad security, but it saved my ass this time)
and I could run everything as root.  I could even create some
new xterms (as root) for experements.  But when I tried to 
"su - keithl" I got:

  Could not chdir to home directory /home/keithl: Permission denied
  /bin/bash: Permission denied

YIKES! 

It is now three hours later, there are a lot of dents in the wall
and in my forehead, and I found the "d-oh!" answer.  It turns
out that the borked scp had changed the permissions of "/" -
the root directory itself - from 755 to 750 .  Thus making the
entire filesystem unreadable to anyone besides root.  I changed
it back to 755, and everything is back to expectations. 
Fortunately, I did not do too much irreversable damage while
frobbing and fussing.

So, kiddies, when this happens, do an "ll -ad /" and pay attention.
Root is a directory, with permissions like everything else.  If it
ever gets set to 750, there goes user functionality.  If it gets
set to 777, there goes your security.

Might I suggest some safeguard, like tripwire, that will monitor the filesystem and alert you to changes? 

Even the open source version could have, with a quick scan of the system, told you what had changed in short order.

   That's the command I did not remember! Just ran it (after logging in, of
course) and it fixed the problem. Wonder why it needed to be reset in the
first place.

   Thanks, Chris. I could log in and start X despite the lack of clarity.

If any of you have experience running both Debian and Arch would you
please provide a quick comparison of the two?

The disadvantages of Ubunutu (the newly introducted desktop, the every
six month re-install, the slowness of package updates for LTS versions)
have finally outweighed my laziness.

I'll be switching to one of those distributions and am doing my research.

Funny, I once moved a thousand-node department away from debian to Ubuntu
because debian's releases were so slow people couldn't use pre packaged
binaries easily (libc and friends would be too old).

How things have changed :)  (this was almost 6 years ago)

The latter sentence is incomplete for a large number of laptop users. 
You also need

  * a graphical environment that won't choke when it's repeatedly
    plugged into and unplugged from external monitors or projectors,

  * wireless network drivers that handle frequent reassociations,

  * a power-saving system that doesn't leave the machine in an
    unusable state after frequent sleep/wake cycles.

It's been our experience at work that those are issues in which Macs 
excel and Linux is often found wanting.

The wonder and the curse of our favorite OS is that "Linux" can mean 
different things in that last sentence: Ubuntu on ThinkPad, Fedora on 
Dell, CentOS on Toshiba, etc. It's very difficult to predict how a 
given revision of a given Linux distribution will work on a given 
laptop model of a given manufacturer.

It won't surprise me at all if the various Linux distributions catch 
up in terms of mobile stability, but my observation is that they 
aren't there yet.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1201161047240.16929@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   The ability of others to ping my IP address, 216.99.206.23, apparently
disappeared when I moved to different DNS servers and a different domain
registrar. Or, it's been non-functional before then but no one told me that.

   I can ping that address from the LAN and it works, but that's looking at
the world-addressable WAN IP address from the inside, not the outside.

   According to the folks at SpiritOne the inability to use ICMP to ping my
address is in my firewall/router, a Netgear FVS318. However, I cannot find
any reference to turning on or off ICMP on any of the admin Web pages. The
docs I have are all for the VPN components of the FVS318 and I don't believe
that I ever learned what to do with it.

You need to find the configuration page for Rules or maybe Outbound
Rules and check the box "Respond to Ping on Internet WAN Port"

ICMP doesn't use TCP or UDP, it is a sibling protocol at the same
layer.  It doesn't use ports either.  Ports are an implementation
detail of both TCP and UDP which just happen to coincide and are often
standardized together, but in IP itself, there's no such thing as
ports.

Instead, ICMP uses a set of message types.  For ping, the messages are
called "echo request" and "echo reply" or something there abouts.
Many other message types exist besides this, some of which are
critical for a properly functioning network connection.

The ability to be ping-ed should not be affected by DNS.  It is almost
certainly an issue with your Netgear router or with your Linux host's
configuration.  tcpdump would be useful in detecting whether or not
echo request packets are making it through the netgear.

I'm betting the latter - domain related changes would not affect IP related
services.

Most home routers come with pings disabled these days. Also, most of them
do not have an option specifically for this service - it's bundled in with
other rather onerous "protections" and labeled something like "Block
anonymous Internet requests" or similar.

You most likely will not be able to enable it specifically. ICMP is a
separate protocol, at the same level as TCP and UDP.

I haven't used a Netgear in years, and I don't think I've ever looked at
the admin panel for a FVS318. Since this model appears to be heavily geared
towards VPN, I would imagine the options related to what you're trying to
accomplish will likely be different from other Netgear interfaces. So I
would not be able to render a guess as to where the option is. I could
probably find it by looking at the interface and poking around for a few
minutes.

Bill,

   There is nothing of the sort on any of the pages. I've looked at all of
them and saw nothing about ping, ICMP, or trace. That's why I asked. :-)

   Depite looking at all pages several times, I consistently missed seeing
the checkbox at the bottom of the Ports page: 'Respond to Ping on Internet WAN
Port'. Just checked that box so if someone will give it a try now we can
confirm that it works.

   Thanks, Wes. Issue resolved and now I can focus on project work.

   One of the SpiritOne guys told me he had the same situation on a router

It's really going to depend on what you're looking for out of a distro
and how familiar or willing you are with working on the command line.
The ArchWiki has a dedicated page comparing itself to other distros:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Compared_to_Other_Distributions

...and a google search on debian vs arch returns more than you could
possibly read on their forums:
https://www.google.com/search?q=+site:bbs.archlinux.org+debian+vs+arch

If you go with Arch, their wiki is indispensable.  Go to the wiki
landing page wiki.archlinux.org and browse a couple of the getting
started documents to get an idea what it'd take to get going.  Next,
do a search on some terms like "gnome" and "suspend" to get a better
idea of what their documentation is like and whether it's your style
(the wiki is its documentation).  Arch makes very few assumptions
about what you want and often lists multiple tools to do the job (i.e.
doesn't assume you want to use NetworkManager).  This is either great
or a nightmare depending on your personality.

Those are excellent suggestions and prompted me to go and re-read.
I'm really looking for a local data point of experience.

Note to others:  Their wiki provides some really nice unbiased descriptions 
of options.  Checking the pages for _Suspend_ or _X Desktop Environment_ for
two examples.

Russell makes a good point.  One of the first things I did was
compare the operating system to the previous night's backup,
made with dirvish/rsync.  Unfortunately, the root directory node
itself does not get backed up exactly (it is named [xxx]/tree 
in the backups).  

While the cryptographic hashes stored by tripwire are indicative
of changes, they are not as foolproof as an actual comparison to
the previous day's bytes.  I used to use tripwire before I went
to full daily backups with rsync.  Though as you can see, nothing
is 100.00% foolproof.

More on backups and rsync in a subsequent message.

Subject: [PLUG] Unison/rsync/git for three way file sync
Message-ID: <20120116210944.GD14696@gate.kl-ic.com>

My wife is now regularly using three different linux machines;
her laptop, her work desktop, and the mail server here.  I
am thinking of some way to share a small directory of work
files between all three machines, without depending on a
remotely mounted filesystem (the machines can be connected,
but often are not).

One possibility is a hacked version of rsync/unison
(www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/) which uses rsync
twice to syncronize pairs of directories.  Three directories
would require 6 rsyncs using the mail server as a hub.
It would be nice to include something that works like
a trash bin.  If she moves a file to the trash directory,
the syncing process would figure that out and move the
file to the trash on the other machines, and erase trash
files on the rest when they were erased on the first.

Another possibility is using a wrapper aroung git.  That
has the behavior I want (including harmonizing versions
with asynchronous changes), but git itself is a little
daunting for the average non-geek.

Perhaps there are other ideas.  Again, the work desktop
and the laptop will not always be able to mount a remote
directory on the mail server for access to work files.
The laptop might go to Waldo Lake, but not the internet.

The PLUG mailing list is no longer being archived by Google.  It
appears to have stopped collecting data since mid last year.  This was
brought to my attention by Michael Rasmussen who mentioned off-list
that he used Google to search the PLUG archives for "arch linux" but
came up empty (I gave a presentation back in October on Arch so I knew
something should've come up).

Searching Google for +site:pdxlinux.org or +site:lists.pdxlinux.org
and then restricting the results to 1 month returned nothing.
Searching for 1 year returned 82 results.  Something's wrong...

Remove date based filtering and search in reverse by month using the
date in the archive's URLs:
+site:pdxlinux.org "2012-January": 0 results
+site:pdxlinux.org "2011-December": 0 results
+site:pdxlinux.org "2011-November": 0 results
+site:pdxlinux.org "2011-October": 2 results (1 plug-jobs and 1 on
plug from someone I won't name)
+site:pdxlinux.org "2011-September": 495 results
+site:pdxlinux.org "2011-August": 392 results
...

Checked the robots.txt on both pdxlinux.org and lists.pdxlinux.org, nothing.

Nothing is in Google from October onward and date-based searching in
Google appears to be broken.  Anyone have any idea what might be going
on here?

I haven't tried this out yet, but for easy syncing with git, there's
SparkleShare - the idea being that it's a git-based alternative to DropBox,
with a desktop client that will sync to one or more git repos for you:

Has anyone had good experiences with any of the small 2-4 system kvm
switches?

I've tried several and they all seem to suck pretty bad.  The latest was a
Belkin SOHO.

I'm trying to set up a config where 1 screen/keyboard/mouse is used for a
home desktop system and a work laptop.

This looks okay to me.  From what I read, it's saying to not index the
index pages, but do follow them.  When it hits an actual message, it's
saying to index them but don't follow any included links.  Perhaps
it's not able to find the original index pages because nothing links
to them that it can follow that's in its database.  Digging...

http://pdxlinux.org/robots.txt has disallow entries for /mailman/ and
/pipermail/, but this applies only to pdxlinux.org domain(?), not
lists.pdxlinux.org.  The email archives are also linked to directly
from pdxlinux.org/mail/, which is crawlable.  Digging...

The two messages from October that Google did index are showing up
because they're linked to from a web history of the #orlug IRC
channel.  This was the only place they were linked from according to
Google:
http://home.borked.us/irc/urllog.shtml

Bing shows only 12 messages from the mailing list archive in all of
2011.  Bing, however also doesn't show much for previous years (159
pages indexed for all years...they lie an say 1,510 results until you
get to page 9 and then it changes to 159).

Anyone else with ideas?  Is there a place someone could've submitted a
URL to tell Google we don't want to be indexed anymore, or is it
possible they just haven't got around to doing it in a while?

   Yes. I have one here with very high quality (== expensive) cables that
worked perfectly for me with a CRT monitor. I keep meaning to sell it on
eBay but haven't gotten around to doing so.

   I _think_ it's a Belkin and I needed a pair of $45 (or more) cables to
make it work properly. Haven't tried it on a LCD monitor.

I've got a 2-port vga/usb only iogear one that was...ok, kinda crappy,
but it worked once you resigned yourself to its limitations.  I've
just started using the cheapest 3-port DVI switcher in the world (this
guy: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L1AIUC/ref=oh_o05_s00_i00_details)
and i don't like it much.

wish there was a cheap magic bullet.  haven't found it yet.

The ones I've had very good luck with are the 'Aten' kvm switches. They come in VGA or DVI and all the cables needed for the number of systems they support. That last part sort of offsets the fact that they are kind of expensive. But since there are no cables to buy, it works out in the end. 

I'd do a google shopping search for them.

If you're willing to use the work laptop sort of in the mode of a secondary
monitor then I would highly suggest looking at Synergy.

http://synergy-foss.org

Cross platform, simple configuration, free as in beer, free as in speech.
 I haven't used it personally in a couple years but I have found it to be
the right tool for the job and fairly stable on several occasions.

I've got an Avocent Switchview DVI that's pretty decent.
So far as I can tell, don't go cheap. Never had any good
experience with low end brands/models.

A Google search on "Arch Linux Daniel Hedlund" seems to refute that claim
as the PLUG mail archive of the announcement is the 7th returned result.
Interestingly, Calagator is #1.

That search result is from www.mail-archive.com not pdxlinux.org.
The actual search terms used that uncovered this were:
    arch site:pdxlinux.org

I'd assumed linux, though that search does turn up something about Roman history.
The references to the distribution do not include Dan's talk or the meeting announcement about it.

Could you be a little more specific?  There are two major kinds,
DVI and VGA, what are you looking for?  And what do you find that
"sucks" about them, that is, what problems do you want to solve?
I assume you want to pass USB keyboard and mouse.

With a laptop interface, I'm guessing you want VGA, though decent
docking cradles often provide DVI.  DVI provides a crisper signal,
though I get by with VGA on a couple of setups.  I've seen VGA
dual port KVMs at the Free Geek Store, and deployed one of them.
I've seen some DVI switches at EcoBinary and Green Century.

The usual problem I have with these switches, DVI more often than
VGA, is providing EDID information from the monitor to the computer
during boot, so the computer knows what it is driving.  Some older
Linux video drivers expect the screen(s) to be connected at boot,
and won't access the EDID after a hot plug.  Other drivers, and
newer ones, work with hot plug just fine.  I got rid of one Intel
motherboard because it wouldn't talk to my favorite screen - another
Intel board with a different video chipset worked just fine.

If a screen doesn't work right directly connected to your computer,
a KVM won't improve things.  Some video chipsets get cranky when
the external screen has a different aspect ratio than the built-in.

Another issue is ghosting.  A high res screen and a cheap cable
will show ghosting.  A KVM implies two cables - if one or the
other is low quality, there will be ghosting on the screen, with
a ghostly replica of the image a few pixels to the right.  Again,
if two cables in series look awful, a KVM is unlikely to help. 
This is more of a problem with VGA, though when ghosting is
bad enough to interfere with a digital DVI signal, it can look
REALLY bad.

You should get high quality cables, "triple coax" for VGA
(fancy connectors and armored sheaths aren't needed).  Cables
should be no longer than necessary.  Longer cables echo more.
You can find a great selection of video cables at pchcables.com 
I use the super-dooper fat ones with the noise-suppressor 
cylinders around the cable.  $6 at PCH, $30 at Best Buy.

There may also be cheap KVMs which don't properly pass the EDID
information, and you get no display at all.  Or their bit rate
or bandwidth is too low for ultra-high-resolution screens. 
I've heard about those, but I've never encountered one.

On my wife's machine at work, we have a KVM selecting between
a Linux and a Windoze VGA source, driving two identical monitors
and two keyboards and mice after a USB hub and a VGA splitter.
The extra screen is turned on when she is working with a visitor
on the other side of her desk.  Pretty handy for showing stuff
or entering data together, without losing face contact.  That
is using a cheap old Belkin switch.  A little ghosting (three
cables in series!) but no problems otherwise.  The cables
from the computers to the switch, and from the switch to the
splitter, are all one foot long, with a three footer from
the splitter to one screen, and a six footer to the other
screen.  As short as possible!

I have an ioGear DVI switch in my office at home, selecting
between four computers, and another Belkin VGA switch fed
from two backroom servers at my wife's office.  The latter
may go away, it looks like we can combine servers.  We only
use the server screens for debug, anyway.

Finally, keep in mind that with Linux and a high bandwidth
ethernet connection, you can use an X client on one machine
with an X server (display/keyboard/mouse) on another.  So
KVM is often unneeded - linux/X11 systems aren't as tied
to a single video path as windoze and mac/aqua are.

There is the Google Webmaster Tools (

discovering a problem. I tried to use it but as I'm not the owner/webmaster

The Video id VGA.
The Keyboard & Mouse are USB.
What I find that "sucks" about them is that they don't switch, or they
switch only some of the devices, or they cause the system to not recognize
devices (usually keyboard/mouse).
Sometimes this behavior is inconsistent as it is with the latest culprit a
Belkin SOHO 2 System.
When it works the video is fine.
The Belkin replaced an IOGear box that created its own combination of
strangeness.

The setup is for my wife who just wants to push a button for the appropriate
system.
Her systems are not old or weird.
The home system is an off-the-shelf Lenovo ThinkCentre M90p-3282-A82, Core
i5-560, 8 Gb DDR3, 500 Gb Mirrored.
The work system is an HP laptop.

Weirdly, the 8 system Belkin switch I use for my rack-o-systems has always
worked great.
Although it also cost several times as much as the little SOHO switch.

This will happen when there's nothing in the KVM to keep the signal alive to the system(s) you are switched away from. Those ports time out, and stop listening. Basically, the system you've switched away from believes there's nothing plugged in any more, and switching back doesn't re-establish the connection. Sometimes unplugging/plugging will restore the connection, but that's a pain when you switch back and forth hundreds of times a day, and not a good idea on some video or PS2 ports. 

If the KVM is a good one, it reads the devices upon startup, and then when the system queries the various ports, it passes the info along. When the KVM is pointed at a different computer, it does whatever keep alive needs to be done on any ports attached to other computers. 

At least, that's how it was explained to me.

Ah - that sounds like what my ioGear does.  If you push the switch
quickly, it switches only the video, for video monitoring.  If you
push and hold for 3(?) seconds, it switches all the ports.  That
is valuable behavior in some circumstances.  Probably not yours,
not for my wife, either.

Since this behavior is common but not universal, and not
advertised, it is a Real Good Idea to download the manuals
and evaluate before buying.  I'm guessing that any advice
we could give you about our own KVMs (likely no longer
being made) won't help you much with the stuff for sale
now.  However ... as of a week ago, Free Geek had some
Belkins that have the behavior approximately like you want.
They are buttonless - you switch them with the Scroll Lock
key on the keyboard  ( [SL] [SL] [1] or [SL] [SL] [2] ).
But don't trust me, check the manual first!

Can that analogy be properly extended to families

   Yep. The linux professionals can comment on the specifics of the
analogise, but those seem broadly appropriate to me.

   The FHS was developed to make all distributions more compatible to
applications. It keeps libraries and system files where an application can
find them. Back in the day, each UNIX version required vendors to create
their product for a specific flavor of UNIX and that hindered the OSes
broader acceptance in the marketplace.

   LILO is the original boot loader and still the default in many (some?)
distributions. GRUB apparently has some advantages for the user, but like
every computer tool, once you become familiar with how to use it properly it
becomes (ahem!) "intuitive."

Subject: [PLUG] lxc containers
Message-ID: <000d01ccd60d$18603960$4920ac20$@martinconsulting.com>

I'm playing with Linux lxc containers, and for the most part liking what I
see.   I'm hoping someone with more experience can verify my understanding
on two points:

1) In a conventional system, if I mount the same file system read/write on
two different mount points, I will most likely corrupt the file system.  I
gather however that the host system can manipulate the container's file
systems freely while the container is operating, even though both have it
mounted, because those container mounts don't really exist.  Can someone
confirm/deny/explain that?

2) The container needs a root file system in order to see all those
important files it needs day-to-day.  If I'm using the container for
security/isolation purposes, that rootfs is separate from the host's rootfs
(don't want them to see /etc/shadow, for example).  In the case that each
container has its own rootfs, don't I need to apply patches to all those
containers each time I patch the host or risk lots of obscure errors due to
the mismatch?

I recently utilized a KVM switch in a distributed computing environment. 
I tried a zonenet before a settling on a ioGear 4-port USB / VGA.

The ioGear was very compact and didn't take up a lot of space.
It was USB powered, so it didn't need 110 VAC power.
It has a cord and small button to step round-robin between hosts.

On power-up, it automatically selects the host on it's first port, 
regardless of which host powered up. The video cards I was using had 
VGA, DVI and HDMI outputs but only drove an output (VGA / DVI / HDMI) if 
it sensed the presence of a flat panel / monitor. If a host was not 
selected by the KVM at boot, no video, so the hosts had to be booted in 
sequence. It would have been nice if the ioGear would have been able to 
reflect the monitor simultaneously to all hosts, but other than that, it 
worked fine.

I briefly looked at KVMs that utilize catx cables between the switch and 
hosts. The ones I looked at utilize a Server Interface Module at each 
host. They were expensive and would not support 1920 x 1080 graphics 
that I needed.

YMMV.

I make no claims about being a "Linux Professional', but I do see one
glaring hole in
this analogy that I think is very relevant when comparing/contrasting Linux
distros. That is
the different package management systems.

I'm not sure how this fits into the analogy. Package management is
certainly not akin to trim or creature comforts. It might be more akin
to manual vs. automatic transmission including manual 4WD option.

All Debian based distros, of which there are many, use the .deb package
format and use the apt package manager. IMO and the opinion of many others
this is a very user friendly package management system that also has a few
GUI front-ends. This is the automatic transmission.

Then there is the .rpm package based distros. Red Hat and Suse are two well
know examples. Personally, I've run into a bit more difficulties using YUM
and sorting out dependency issues. Granted some of that has to do with my
intermediate level of Linux Administration skill level. This kind of like
auto transmission, but you have the option for overdrive or 4 WD. Meaning
sometimes you have to change gears yourself depending on the situation or
you could get stuck. Terrible analogy...

Then there is Gentoo and the Portage/Ebuild package management system. This
is the manual transmission with 4 WD where you have to get out of the
vehicle and lock the hubs. It's also a kit car because you custom build the
system to your needs. Not for new drivers of Linux.

I hope that serves to help in understanding some of the differences between
Linux distros...

Cheers,

Mike

   Auto manufacturers. Fortunately, Microsoft never built cars or the clutch

With LXC, the parent OS handles all filesystem activity on behalf of
the container (so consistency is covered).

I think the answer is that you need to patch the container OS as well.
There may be a model where you share a read-only view of the parent OS's
/usr to the container, though that may have just been wishful thinking
based on the workings of Solaris containers.

Is there a reason to use a hardware KVM switch.  I am using Synergy to 
control my
three systems with one keyboard and mouse.  This application gives me 
the ability
to copy and paste from and to any system.  Very handy. You do have 
multiple monitors
but I like the larger real estate for my applications.

Sounds like you are looking for a version control distributed file

I haven't tried it yet, but I plan on it.

Did I not make clear that for purpose of the analogy I  make 
clear differing repository schemes had a similarity to 
differing manufacturers - i.e. no expectation of 
interchangeable parts. OK, so I'm of an age which recalls 
lack of standardization of how driver interacted with an 
automatic transmission across manufactures - not even to 
pull from a museum how "standard" transmissions differed. 
IIRC there was a 50's era Desoto which did not require use 
of clutch pedal when shifting.

   Also a Chrysler New Yorker of the same era with its 'hydromatic clutch'

Interestingly enough - I just tried this and it didn't work.  I'm running
Ubuntu 11.10 and use a "blank screen" for the screen saver.  Maybe that's
the difference (rather than running an actual screen saver).

According to Xorg's commit history, it appears the bug has been around
since the end of June and 13 releases were made with the bug.

Based on the thread and other blogs, Fedora 16, Debian Wheezy
("testing"), ArchLinux, Gentoo and probably others are affected.
Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) appears to be unaffected.

galen,

   Here's what I just received from Patrick:

"Good morning Rich - as you had contacted me already regarding the pending
changes to DSL connectivity over Frontier, I wanted to send you an update.
Starting next week (Jan 23) we will be migrating the majority of our
residential customers to the new platform, and contacting customers
individually in daily batches. We expect to begin migration of DSL circuits
identified as possibly hosting their own services or with advanced networks
the following week (Jan 30). I will be using this announcement as a template
for our general announcement to Frontier customers on Monday.

"Once the changes are complete, your DSL modem (or firewall/router, if the
modem is configured as a bridge) will need to be reconfigured to
authenticate via PPPoE, rather than the current configuration as a 1483
Bridge with static IP address. You will use the following for the PPPoE
credentials -

"PPPoE username: <DSL-number>@value.net (for example, 5032221234 at value.net)

"PPPoE password: spiritone

"Information on reprogramming Zoom modems received from us will be available
on our website. Additionally we will attempt as best we can to research and
provide information on reprogramming other DSL modems as well as routers.
Please note we may not be able to locate information on all makes and models
of equipment. If your network was originally installed by an outside
technician, you may want to make contact with them for additional
information as well.

"Thank you for your patience during these changes!"

   My Netgear VFS318 lets me change to PPPoE by selecting a different radio
button; I assume it then presents text entry widgets for the username and
password. Patrick wrote that his circuit was changed at 9:00pm last night
(midnight EST), he changed his router and was back online at 9:03pm.
Everyone should have it this easy!

soft link from that to /usr/bin/firefox. But, when I type './firefox' at the

   Could this be because I got a 32-bit version rather than a 64-bit version?

yes it could. I get that exact error when I try to run an executable with
an architecture mismatch.

the error comes from libraries it's trying to find but can't. you can use
ldd /opt/firefox/firefox to see which ones.

   That's what I thought. I assumed that mozilla.com recognized the OS but
apparently not.

Subject: [PLUG] Mac Linux Unix Mail
Message-ID: <20120121070203.GA27272@gate.kl-ic.com>

This is for the Mac/BSD/Unix folks.

I'm integrating a Mac into a small pond of Linux machines. 
For email, the Linux machines run postfix, procmail,
spamassassin, and mutt, with postgray on two outwards
facing servers.  No gui mail readers, no POP/IMAP stuff. 
I'm trying to make things as uniform as possible.  

The (non-technical) Mac user wants to use the Mac Mail
client, and POP/IMAP from her outside account.  I also
want to feed internal mails directly into the Mac's
postfix smtp input.  The mails are highly sensitive,
I don't want to pass them through any external mail 
servers, and I would rather not secure and maintain
dovecot on our internal LAN (I will if I must).

I will also have an account on the Mac, using mutt,
accessed through ssh.  

First, where on the web should I be looking for clues
and suggestions?  Any keywords that might help? 

Second, can I set the Mac up with Maildir format for
backup uniformity with the Linux machines? 

Third, if I tweak postfix and procmail to feed internal
mail directly to an inbound Mac user folder/directory,
am I risking breakage?  Is there a best way to do this?

Are you, perhaps, making it complicated? A mac is a BSD box with a
proprietary GUI.

A related question is system status email.  My Linux systems
generate a dozen emails per day with status.  The "internal
mails" I'm thinking about would be like that: "Here's today's
scheduled clients"  "Here's this morning's missed calls". 
It may be that the Mac can't use email to notify - you run
a gui app (or Terminal and "less") to look at the logs.  

I may end up having to run dovecot on localhost and feed Mac
Mail that way.  At least I can feed postfix at the front end.

I hope the folks with experience in both worlds can help here.
As one helpful fellow suggested, "ask the PDX Perl folk", so
I will try there.

Keith

It's sometimes a PITA to copy it line-by-line and have bash honor the

So, you are looking for a way to do:

./configure option1 option2 ?

Where option1 option2 ? are from a file?

How about:

./configure `cat optionfile`

Rich,

On the first line put ./configure \
With all you options below.
Then execute it with a tcsh or bash YMMV:  bash my_configure.sh.  I 
usually put this file in the src directory of the application I am 
compiling.

   I'll try that. I tried piping the file and redirecting with the '<'
symbol, but didn't try cat and quotes.

Ken,

   I have a 6-line configuration-options.txt file with continuation
backslashes at the end of the first 5 lines. Rather than typing them
one-by-one I copy each one to the vt in which I'm building the app. I'd like
to re-write the options file to a single long line and pass that to the
command line. Russell's idea may well work.

Thanks,

Rich

Seems like xargs would be the appropriate tool.

xargs ./configure < configuration-options.txt

I don't think you would need the backslashes in your options file
either.  I haven't tried it with configure, but I just tried the
following and it worked as expected.

-l

Ken,

   I hadn't thought of putting it all in a shell script. That's the best
solution!

Many thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Has Google taken over browser settings?
Message-ID: <20120121183006.141f74ba@mailhost.pdx.edu>

It used to be that to go to eBay all I had to type in the URL bar was
"ebay" (Firefox or Opera), and the browser would assume I wanted to
add .com to the URL. Of course, if I wanted pdxlinux it would assume I
wanted pddxlinux.com, so you could leave off the .com only with sites
that were really .com sites.

Several months ago I noticed that Firefox no longer did this. When I
type "ebay" in the URL bar it takes me to Google. Google lists eBay at
the top of the hits, but I still have to wait for the Google page to
load and then click a second time. This is very annoying. Google gets
the benefit of another web user going to their site and seeing their
ads, at the expense of the user's time and convenience.

And it does the same now for Opera as well. I've looked everywhere in
both browsers for a setting to change it back to the old behavior, but
I can't find it anywhere. Note that I said that I can't find it; I did
not say it's not there. :) Both browsers have thousands of settings to
sort through, half of which are incomprehensibly labeled.

Is this another usurpation of the web by the giant that I love to
hate? Has anyone else noticed this? Or is it my fault again?

Okay, place blame where it is due.  That is the decision of the browser
authors, not googles fault.  All google is guilty of is paying opera and
Firefox a lot to be their default search engine.  In the case of Firefox,
it was in the region of 100 million dollars which substantially helped the
Firefox mission.

Google is a hero here.  I really dislike the new browser setting too, and
am suspicious of googles motives in general, but let's not blame them when
they're doing good.

I googled how to fix opera not to do that with total success. Sorry I'm on
my phone now and can't find the reference but it wasn't hard to find

   Nope. I've always typed the full URL for _all_ sites; e.g.,
http://www.ebay.com/. There's no abiguity that way. However, that's just how
I've always done it.

See Chris's message for placing blame where it's due, and for the
record, this is a change I actually like (although I'm a full-time
chrome user, which behaves similarly).

The workaround (tested in ff):  press <ctrl>-enter instead of <enter>

The fix: (also in Firefox)

Open about:config, click "Yes I'll be careful, type "keyword.enabled"
into the search box in the about:config *page*, click on the
keyword.enabled line so it is set to false.

Not exactly the first thing you think of...

Yay!

Thanks for finding the fix!

And yes, I know Google does a lot of great stuff that benefits me and
everyone else, inside and outside of the open source community. But
their power scares me. However, that is a discussion for PLUG-talk, so
I'll shut up about it now.

Is there a reason to use a hardware KVM switch.  I am using Synergy to 
control my
three systems with one keyboard and mouse.  This application gives me 
the ability
to copy and paste from and to any system.  Very handy. You do have 
multiple monitors
but I like the larger real estate for my applications.

Subject: [PLUG] WRT54G DHCP - always serve the same IP address to a
	particular device?
Message-ID: <4F1C9951.3060406@comcast.net>

Is it possible to tell my WRT54G to always serve the same IP address to 
a particular device?

I have a ReplayTV 4080 (hereinafter referred to as RTV) digital video 
recorder. It is no longer in production although there is a community of 
users providing some support. I am using software provided by a segment 
of that community to allows me to sit at any of the computers in the 
house and manage the RTV. It depends on knowing where to find the RTV. I 
set the RTV to use a static IP address but there is a bug in the RTV's 
firmware. When first started up it uses the assigned IP address. But 
after some indeterminate amount of time it ignores the fact that it has 
a static IP address and goes looking for one supplied by a DHCP server, 
which in this case is my WRT54G router.

The support group offers two solutions. One is to have the DHCP server 
reserve an IP address for the RTV. Can I do that with my WRT54G?

The other is to change the lease time to longer than a week. I'm not 
sure how this helps, but that was what was recommended. I think it has 
to do with the RTV rebooting itself more than once a week. But why the 
lease duration would make any difference to the RTV when it's DHCP bug 
kicks in isn't clear to me.

The better, longer term solution will be to build a Myth box. But until 
then I'm stuck with trying to make this RTV work.

Any ideas will be appreciated.

You want to go into the DHCP server configuration section and add static
IPs by MAC address. I'm using the DD-WRT firmware for my WRT54G, and it's
under the Services tab (first page, also called Services). At the bottom of
the DHCP section, there is a place to add static addresses.

Sure.  I think the stock firmware allows you to set "reserved" or "static"
DHCP assignments.  I know that the Tomato replacement firmware does.

It is offered on my Linksys WRT300N. I seem to recall the lower base models
don't have this option. On my Basic Setup screen, there is an entry for
"DHCP Server: Enabled or Disabled" and to the right of that is a button
labeled "DHCP Reservation." I would not be surprised to find this is
missing from your model.

In my WRT300N interface, the highest I can push my lease time is 9999
minutes, or just shy of 1 week. At least it's better than the default of 1
day. I guess the theory behind this being potentially helpful is that if
the router gets a DHCP request from a client that already has an active
lease, it will automagically reassign the same IP back to it. This should
also be happening when it's within the 1 day window, so I am pretty
skeptical that this could help.

Subject: [PLUG] Looking for a v1.0 Linksys WRT54G,
	will trade two comparable v1.1 to v4.0 or WRT54GL
Message-ID: <86pqebkyil.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


Anybody have a version 1.0 Linksys WRT54G lying around?  It doesn't
even have to be working.  I would be happy to trade 2 used-but-working
flashable version 1.1 or later (4.0 is the last one with 4 meg of
flash) or a WRT54GL (also has 4 meg of flash).  

The version 1.0 has a 5V power supply and serial number that start with
CDF0 or CDF1.  I am very particular about the version.  I am not
particular about it working.  I need a few of the passive parts from
inside, so the parts inside must-be-present-to-win.

If you want, I'll even flash a recent version of OpenWrt on the
replacements.

Let me know, thanks!

Alas, Wes is correct. I don't find "DHCP Reservation" in my WRT54G 
administration browser interface.

Here are the first four options in the Network Address Server Settings 
section on the Basic Setup tab:

DHCP Server:             (*) Enable ( ) Disable
Starting IP Address:     192.168.0.[100]
Maximum Number
of DHCP Users:           [50]
Client Lease Time:       [0] minutes (0 means one day)

There appears to be nothing related to reserving an IP address within 
the DHCP range.

If I keep an eye on the ReplayTV by pinging it every so often I should 
see it go get an IP address via DHCP. I can then figure out what address 
it got and change the WiRNS configuration to look for the RTV at that 
address. I would also reconfigure the RTV to use that address as it's 
static address. And if I set the Client Least Time to 9999 I'll get 6.9 
something days at that IP address. If most of the devices in the house 
with IP addresses are set to static, maybe the same address will be 
assigned to the RTV serendipitously?

I have never seen a router that does not allow you to assign a static IP
addresses to a MAC address. Sometimes they hide it really well, but they
all had that feature somewhere.
What firmware do you have in this router?  Do you have the firmware that
came with the router? If so which version of the WRT54G do you have?

In my job I deal with people working at home over the internet. I've seen
at least a dozen distinct router models, and many of them really did not
have an option to set up a DHCP reservation. It seems to be a residential
vs. commercial market delineation. Many (perhaps just several) features
fall on one side or the other of this split.

For Rich, the other option I can think of would be to use one of the Linux
hosts as the DHCP server. Then you can set all the reservations you want.

Or as a dirty hack style workaround, you could set EVERY other device in
the house to have a static IP, then specify the DHCP range to be 1 IP. I
suspect this will cause other problems, but would at least be interesting
to try just to see the resulting behavior of the RTV device.

You can assign static ip addresses in the WRT54G but then you have to
manually configure all the devices with static ip addrs. Not a terribly
difficult or time consuming task for a few computers and a printer.

Yes, I should not have used the word static, permanent would have been a
less confusing word. I was trying to describe the concept you call DHCP
reservation. The idea being that all IP addresses are assigned to each
device by the router, but some devices are given a permanent IP address
based on their MAC address.  I still think the WRT54G likely has the DHCP
reservation capability. If it does not, the Tomato firmware or any of the
other open source firmwares for the router do have it. (Provided this
particular WRT54G supports alternative firmware).

*Correction* - I confused static WAN ip addrs with static LAN ip addrs. If
you get a static WAN ip addrs from your ISP you can configure it in the
WRT54G. You wouldn't need to do this for LAN ip addrs as you just configure
the static ip addrs on the same LAN ip subnet.

Your .ssh directory is not supposed to be world readable; if you were on a
box that someone else had access to (I suspect you're not), they could
navigate to your home directory, copy your private keys out of .ssh, and
then log in as you on any box that has your public key already.

Like I said, you probably don't have much to worry about if you're the only
user on that box, but if you want to set it up properly, set your .ssh
directory to 700 (and any files within to 600).

Your .ssh file should not be world readable or executable.  Opens you to 
bad operators.

I would guess that the permissions for ~/.ssh are probably too
liberal.  You really don't need it to be world-readable.  The ssh(1)
man page says about this directory "There is no general requirement to
keep the entire contents of this directory secret, but the recommended
permissions are read/write/execute for the user, and not accessible by
others."

In my experience, this type of thing usually happens when you do a
recursive chmod on your /home/<yourname> directory (or, just the contents
of the directory). Often times we do such a "chmod -R /home/<yourname>"
because permissions can get messed up via accidental command (such as a
typo when logged in as root), or due to transfer/restore of
/home/<yourname> from another computer/backup.

Just some thoughts... in case you're trying to figure out how this happened
in the first place.

   All the tools and applications I build locally are in /opt. Because
top-level directories are owned by root.root I change the mode of /opt to
777 so I can download files to it, move files to it, etc.

   For some reason beyond my understanding, the permissions keep changing
back to 755. I downloaded an application upgrade about a half-hour ago after
needing to change the mode to 777; just tried to download the latest
postgres and the directory was 755 again.

   What might cause this?

It might well have been the application you loaded.  Some packages will set
the permissions to what they think they should be.  You can look at the
package manifest it you like.  (rpm -qlv, for rpm-based distros)

Hi, Ali!

   The first application was jGnash, the personal checkbook manager written
in Java. The second was the postgresql source because the SlackBuild is a
few versions behind.

Thanks,

Mine seems to be dead or dying and I'd like to swap test before getting a replacement.

Subject: [PLUG] Sorting Text File By Date
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1201251411270.23709@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have a text file with dates in the common US slash-delimited format of
m/d/Y; single digits are not prepended with zeros. The file is in reverse
order; that is, today's date is at the top and the earliest data is at the
bottom. For plotting, I need to reverse the line order. (There's a numeric
value associated with each date.)

   After reading the sort man page I tried several options, but they all
consider each portion of the date as a separate field. This means that all
Januarys (1/) are contiguous by day and year.

   Is there a sort option that will do this but was not obvious to me? Or, is
there another tool that will do the job?

TIA,

Rich

   Heh-heh! The BSD 'rev' reverses the character order, line-by-line. Not
what I need. Sigh.

You're not actually sorting anything, you're just reversing line order?

If all you need to do is reverse the order of the lines, then the tac
command is what you need.

   See my previous message.

Here are the first two lines of the input file:

1/24/2012  0.50
1/23/2012  0.43

Here's what rev produces:

05.0  2102/42/1
34.0  2102/32/1

   Not quite reversing line order. :-)

   The rev man page shows no options for the tool.

Thanks to everyone for all the ideas.

For now I'm trying the idea of assigning the most recently served IP 
address to the ReplayTV as its static IP address. My experience has 
shown that the WRT54G consistently assigns this address to that device. 
I know I couldn't count on it in a more active setting, but I'm going to 
try this for awhile and see what happens. If it doesn't work then I'll 
investigate what I need to do to start using my Ubuntu desktop as a DHCP 
server.

i seem to remember that if you boot from a GParted live CD, it can resize
your Windows partition without damaging anything.

My personal experience has been that most distributions can resize during
install quite safely. However if you are at all worried about data loss a
complete backup before install or re-partitioning with GParted is always a
good idea.

This was a big problem for my Lenovo T510. The solution ultimately came
from a tool called PerfectDisk from Raxco. As I recall I had to use the
Pro edition. The basic edition didn't have the feature's required to
completely solve the problem though it did get me started in the right
direction.

I'm not sure if they do this any longer but they had a free trial
for both the basic and Pro edition. I was able to do to everything I
needed under terms of the trial. But then I paid for it anyway as
a way of thanks, and I've not used the software since.

If you're thinking about trying Ubuntu, they have a Windows installer
called wubi that actually creates a disk image that lives on the Windows
partition (just go to Ubuntu's download page and you'll see a link for "run
with Windows"). This gives you the ability to dual-boot without the need to
re-partition your disk. It also makes it really easy to uninstall Ubuntu
and try something else if it doesn't work out for you.

I did a couple of Google searches on  GParted. Everything I

NOTHING explicitly mentioned moving data from one physical

I'm nominally past that stage. I've a bunch of "live CD's. 
I've several that seem to offer promise after running them 
from a CD. Now is time for a 'real world' test.

served as a witness to an acceptance test of a backup

CHUCKLE was my first thought.
However Windows(tm) has a nasty habit of telling user that 
such-and-such file may not be copied. I have no idea of what 
file(s) reside in doubtful area.

A reasonable suggestion.
In fact I _agreed_ with you - please notice tense.
Both Ubuntu and Wubi were tried and found lacking.
Wubi's down-check may be due to a possible hardware failure.
Ubuntu fails due to ignoring that only internet connection 
may be dialup.

When using a Linksys router, any fixed LAN IP address must be outside the
DHCP server range (typically 192.168.1.100 thru 192.168.1.149), and it
cannot end in 0, 1, or 255.

Therefore any fixed LAN IP address would normally need to be in the range of
192.168.1.2 thru 192.168.1.99 or
192.168.1.150 thru 192.168.1.254
assuming you are still using the default DHCP server range.

There is no need for any third party software. Gparted which is part
of the installation process of the distribution will move those files
for you if you are changing the partitions.

Thanks.

All that makes sense. My setup is to use numbers from 254 on down as my 
static IP addresses and let the router serve 100 through 149. I used a 
Netgear router for many years before installing the WRT54G. It only 
served something like 16 or 32 dynamic addresses starting with 
192.168.002. That's when I began the convention of starting at 254 and 
working down for static addresses.

I imagine it will be at least a few years before I need very many 
addresses. Addressable household appliances are coming -- so they say -- 
but the plain vanilla ones will have to wear out before I would consider 
upgrading to a "smart" one. A fridge with a bar code scanner might be 
handy for keeping track of inventory, but might have a high enough WAF. 
(I read on the MythTV site that WAF = Wife Acceptance Factor.)

Normally I wouldn't assign a static IP address in the range of 100-149 
but in this case, since the device has a bug that ignores the setting 
that it be static and goes looking for a DHCP server I'm assigning it 
the address the server gave it the first few times it asked. And I'm 
assuming, based on the very limited traffic on that DHCP server, that it 
will continue to assign that address whenever the buggy device asks for 
one. If it doesn't work, then I'll move on to a more capable DHCP server.

The USB clickers I'm familiar with act like they are keys on the
keyboard.  The same keys codes drive slides in both Powerpoint
and Impress.  So almost all clickers should work out of the
box.   The few that are weird will all work with Powerpoint,
while Impress may require some preference configuration.
Probably not, though.   Assume any remote is either completely
compatable, or compatable after 5 minutes of one-time tweaks
to Impress.

Far more important is range and ease of use.  More buttons
is not better.  You want to focus on your talk, not on your
fancy clicker, so forward/back is usually all you need. 
A built in laser can be handy, as long as you don't get it
confused with forward and back.

I have a fancy four button plus laser remote, since my own
presentation tool (http://server-sky.com/wydiwys) can do
hierarchical navigation with the third button.  But after
accidentally punching into nav mode too many times, It is
better to just use the laptop keyboard and mouse for that.  

You want a clicker that uses AAA batteries, not coin cells.
You should be able to buy replacement batteries at a 7-11.

There are probably bluetooth clickers by now.  Associating
bluetooth is too time consuming.  Stick with USB.  The
little USB dongle might get left behind, so small is not
as important as whether you can tie a flag with a "return
to John Jordan" message on it.

So, read the reviews, and worry about range and ergonomics,
not compatability so much.  If you can wait for it to arrive,
I'd see what people like at Newegg and buy there.  Newegg
tends to have smarter customer reviews than Amazon, and the
prices are often better.

Yes, I would need to verify the model but note that Free Geek usually

Ken,
    lspci should still be the tool to use.  Have you tried forcing it to
use direct hardware access? (I.E " lspci -b -t -D -v -nn -H1 -M")  The
"-H1"  or "-H2" options force use of two different hardware access modes.

Subject: [PLUG] super-restrictive IPtables
Message-ID: <20120128182009.GA19081@gate.kl-ic.com>

I want to set up an internal network with very restricted traffic.

Sadly, a service vendor for my wife's office has a web interface
that only talks to Internet Exploder with a local app that must
run under windoze.   Another supplier will only deal with 
Quickbooks over the web.  We have a little windoze box (ASUS
B202) running winXP with no network connection.  I don't want
it connected to the internet.  It could get 0wned by the wrong
popup ads, and I don't want to spend a lot of time keeping it
updated (this is not possible for zero day exploits, anyway).

Possible Solution:  Feed it from the Linux firewall over a
dedicated LAN, through a firewall set to just pass ports 80 and
443 to a short list of IP addresses, with local DNS for a few
addresses from a static table on the firewall.  If a service
vendor gets 0wned, the local windows box might too, but it
cannot call home to base, spread the infection, or hammer on
the linux LAN.  I might also open the IP addresses for M$ updates.

My biggest concern is that I am underestimating the number of
IP addresses I will need to talk to and how often they change.
Perhaps there is some tool to update the local DNS table without
a lot of effort.  Updates should happen only when I tell the
firewall to do so, and can review the table, a few times a year.

Any helpful ideas?

Keith

P.S. The Great Windoze Meltdown could happen any day - the fact that
80% of windoze machines do not seem to be 0wned does not guarantee
that they will never be.  Large scale attacks are probably already
seeded out there, and may be launched if some general has a bad day.
I prefer to be ready to help my neighbors, instead of another victim.

Maybe I am asking the wrong question.  Maybe this one will work for me: 
How do you turn on a pci card after boot.  The module that services it 
is loaded, but the device is not visible.

Subject: [PLUG] truly wierd video screen behavior on new system install of
 Ubuntu Lucid Lynx install
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHcYw-yePoPrLDAh05eAJ6DYWCsSVggpkDTQv0Tw3Dfv4w@mail.gmail.com>

This is a brain-storming request.

I just purchased an Asus P8H61-M rev B3 motherboard which uses the
Intel H61 chipset.  I attached an Acer G205HV lcd monitor which says
that it is capable of running 1600x900 vga dvi-d (I am still trying to
figure out what vga dvi-d means)  I am SOLELY using the vga cable into
this monitor.

After installing 64 bit Ubuntu Lucid Lynx edition 10.04.3 LTS linux, I
have a truly bizarre video screen being presented.  Only 3 resolutions
are available 1024x768, 800x600 and 640x480, however selecting either
the 800x600 or 640x480 causes such severe problems that only the reset
switch or power switch can be used as the next choice.

The last 5th or so of the video screen is snipped and moved to the
first part of the screen and the next 4/5 shoved to the right.  Even
the mouse movement is constrained in a similar manner.

While booting up, the Asus BIOS information appears correctly on the
VGA screen.  The Ubuntu splash screen is also correctly displayed.
However the Ubuntu logon screen is chopped up and the last 1/5th moved
over to the left.

It is almost as if the video sync pulse moved to the 4/5 point.

Does anyone have any ideas on how this might be solved?  I really
would like to get Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS working on the Asus P8H61-M verB3
motherboard using the Intel I3-2120 processor chip, if possible.

Thanks for any and all ideas!!

The BIOS and Ubuntu splash screen usually use 640x480, although it is
possible to get the splash screen to run at a higher res. The real high
res stuff doesn't happen until just before the login screen.

Lucid (that is X) is not getting or properly interpreting the EDID data
from the monitor. You should find additional clues
in /var/log/Xorg.0.log. That log file can get kind of long, as it
appends with each new boot. I have had better luck reading it in the
past by renaming the existing one just before rebooting so it will
generate a fresh one containing just the details about the current boot.

There are also dmesg and lspci which can give you some details to google
on.

Also see what happens when you boot to live CDs, particularly the
Lucid one. I will bet that the same problem happens with the Lucid live
CD, but if it does not, then you know the problem is in your
installation configs, not in Lucid. And, of course, try other live CDs,
especially cutting edge ones like Mint and Fedora, or even the latest
Ubuntu. I might also remind that the next Ubuntu LTS comes out in a few
months, so installing the latest non-LTS version would be merely a
stopgap if you want to stick with LTS versions.

WAG: Adjust refresh rate to 60Hz. If 640x480 works at BIOS startup
then it should work later if the refresh isn't too high (or, I
suppose, too low, but that isn't usually the problem) for the LCD.

To everyone:

I found that the linux drivers for the Intel "Sandy Bridge" chipset
were in bad shape a year ago and it took a year's work to fix this
problem.  Unfortunately Intel has the fix for the Linux v3.1 kernel
and I am only using v2.6.32-37 right now in Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS.

Intel Linux Open Source developers say that the code now works great,
so do I have to attempt to pull linux v3.1 into Ubuntu 10.04 ?? I
really don't want to go to the new Unity desktop since looking at
animated pictures is not my cup of tea, although kids love it.

As to the Acer G205HV monitor, apparently I found a firmware bug and
it is permanently stuck in a wierd mode whenever 1024x768 VGA @ 60 hz
is flung at it and starts the beginning of the frame about 1/5 the way
into the screen and then wraps from the right hand side over to the
left.  I tried several times to reset this monitor back to default,
but it appears permanently ROMed.  Using the other LCD monitors I had,
I found that the wierd screen was located on the Acer, not with the
linux kernal video driver.

So, in recap, has anyone successfully pulled linux v3.1 into Ubuntu 10.04?

Is this going to be a big headache?

Thanks for your advice

As I understand it,
DVI - I: The cable has pins and conductors for both digital and analog 
signals
DVI - D: The cable only has pins and conductors for digitized pixel data.
DVI - A: The cable only has pins and conductors for analog pixel data.

There is also the possibility of dual link - doubling up on the number 
of pins / conductors used to transmit video in digital mode.
Dual link is provided for color depth >24 bits / pixel or clock rates 
 >165 Mhz.
Some of what I have read indicates that dual mode can support BOTH clock 
rates > 165 Mhz. and color depth > 24 bits / pixel - but I am suspicious.

I agree with your dislike of Unity, and I can add that I also dislike
Gnome 3.x, even though I happily used Gnome for years. When I upgraded
to Fedora 16 I had no easy choice if I wanted to use the old Gnome, so
I moved to Xfce. Now that I have been using it for several months I
realize that I should have moved to it a long time ago. No icons or
animations unless you want them.

I would recommend trying the Oneiric Xubuntu live CD. I think that will
give you the kernel you need. And if Oneiric doesn't come withn3.1,
then 3.1 is probably be available in the update repos. I haven't
checked these two statements for accuracy, but doubtless someone here
will correct me if I'm wrong.

And the reason you haven't returned this monitor to the store is ... ?

Unless there's a physical switch on your EeePC to enable/disable the
wireless radio, I don't know of any other way to "turn on the pci card
after boot". If the correct module is loaded by the kernel the PCI device
should be visable and usable. It's mostly likely that the wrong module is
being loaded by the kernel. This is the same problem I ran into. The
wireless module was loaded but I didn't see the device listed nor did I see
the wireless icon LED illuminated on my laptop.

Although this may not be for the same wireless card you have, I think it
has most of the info you need and the steps to sort it out.

To all:

FYI:

Regarding the trouble getting graphics to work on the Asus P8H61-M 
motherboard, by switching to Ubuntu "Precise" kernel v3.2, all graphics 
problems were resolved.  Evidentally the correct Intel drivers did make 
it into the Xorg code and also the supporting kernel parameters.  The 
old v2.6.32 kernel just couldn't handle the Intel "SandyBridge" H61 chipset.

So if you do use an Asus P8H61-M or similar Asus card, you definitely 
will have to run Ubuntu "Oneiric" or "Precise" to support the Intel 
Sandybridge integrated graphics.

I consider this problem now closed (after burning 3 or 4 cds and doing 
installs and watching the results)

Ubuntu Precise Pangolin is very smooth and precise about a number of

Salt is a distributed configuration management and remote execution
platform built on top of ZeroMQ and Python. Simple, fast, powerful and
extensible.

Daniel will give a presentation on the architecture of Salt and how it
leverages ZeroMQ to provide a simple but highly scalable and parallel
method of software deployment.

"Salt is a distributed remote execution system used to execute
commands and query data. It was developed in order to bring the best
solutions found in the world of remote execution together and make
them better, faster and more malleable. Salt accomplishes this via its
ability to handle larger loads of information, and not just dozens,
but hundreds or even thousands of individual servers, handle them
quickly and through a simple and manageable interface."

Subject: [PLUG] Are we having booting fun yet? (no)
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHcWxYvFCV=ahUbEEwn76BVQtaFsDxUVsrubWzZxCGyXoQ@mail.gmail.com>

After getting the Ubuntu 12.04 software to run the Asus P8H61-M
motherboard, I decided to try setting up multiple partitions,
including two OS's on the 1 terabyte WD drive.

After using up several hours of time trying to load up two copies of
Ubuntu and failing, I did learn the following:

Installing one version of Ubuntu under the GPT type of partition table
fails.  In fact trying two OS's under the GPT type fails, even though
gparted is able to create the GPT partition type and merrily chop up
the terabytes into gigabyte partitions.

I then let Ubuntu build a system using MSDOS partitions.  It succeeded
and used up one primary partition for the /boot and an extended
partition for / (root) and /home partitions.

Next I rebooted the live install CD disks and asked Ubuntu to install
a second system alongside the first.  Suddenly the installer program
hit a fatal error and quit.

I tried this 3 times before becoming convinced that a fatal error
really occurred.

Question:

How can I successfully install 9 GPT partitions on this terabyte drive
and successfully install two copies of Ubuntu 12.04?

Are there any GRUB2 Ubuntu wizards that know how to do this?

Thanks, I really appreciate any help on this.  I want to be able to
boot up with a choice of either Ubuntu OS, since I am going to use the
second one for a special purpose.

Are you using BIOS or UEFI boot?  Mixing BIOS boot with GPT can be
tricky, and is not something that I have done.  If you intend to boot
using UEFI, you *must* boot the installer using UEFI.  At least that
was my experience when I installed Mythbuntu 11.10 amd64 on an Intel
DB65AL motherboard.  Also, should you decide to go with UEFI and GPT,
I'd recommend wiping the first MB or so of the disk, just to be sure
nobody gets confused by the presence of any MBR that might be leftover
from previous install attempts.

Galen:

The Asus P8H61-M claims that it is an EFI board, so I probably should be 
using UEFI.

Unfortunately, I am currently using BIOS, and while GRUB2 could see the 
gpt partitions, it could not get the boot correct.

I even tried making 2 primary partitions under MSDOS, in hopes that 
GRUB2 would see them, but the gparted manager would only allow 1 boot flag.

Not sure where to go from here.  (It is my growing impression that the 
install scripts on the Live CD for Ubuntu are pretty rigid)

Anyone know how to set up a UEFI boot for Ubuntu 12.04?

Thanks for your time.

Blvd, Portland, OR (Hollywood District) the event will start at 19:30 
PST (7:30PM) and will run for a couple hours depending on how long we 
feel like staying out. Got Pho has a full Vietnamese cuisine to include 
Pho (Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup), Vietnamese Sandwiches, Thai Iced 
Teas, Domestic and Asian Beer and so much more.

Got Pho is not too expensive at all with a meal + beverage costing about 
$10-15 and the portions are pretty generous they also offer Wifi on-site 
and the restaurant is easily accessible from the freeway.

Please RSVP at the following link so I know how many reservations to 
make and also feel free to reply to list and let us know if your coming:

Burn a copy of the alternate ISO for whatever architecture you are 
installing on instead of using the primary ISO.

Have you tried booting the Live CD using UEFI?  If not, I'd recommend
trying that.  On my Intel board, it's under Boot->UEFI Boot->Enabled.
If that works, I think the installer will default to using UEFI+GPT.

I am sure anyone could point out the way to unsubscribe is through the

80% of those Windoze systems not 0wned, how many actually are but the users
are totally unaware that they are 0wned?

You could run Tinyproxy with Dansguardian and then use the filters in
Dansguardian to restrict where the XP host can go via the web, if at all?
Then use IPTABLES to further restrict.


This is also a configuration from squid to allow windows update that should
be placed at the top of the acl.

This is Excellent Stuff, thanks!  I had not thought of filtering
the windoze box through a proxy, a pretty easy solution, thank you
for pointing it out.  I assume that a proxy can be compatable with
AJAX-style active conversations between servers and browsers.

I will look for more tools in the DansGuardian genre.  DG may be
the best, or there may be other filters that are better suited. 
I will be whitelisting rather than blacklisting, with cooperative
users.  The windoze box and the dedicated Alix firewall are the
only machines on that LAN segment.  That simplifies the task.

The proxy/filter tool should run entirely on the firewall, no
change to the windoze box beyond telling it to use the proxy
(no packets will move otherwise).  It would be nice if the
tool can automagically train, with a training on/off switch. 
During training, it accepts (and logs) every outgoing request.
With training disabled, the tool shouldn't talk to anybody new. 
Perhaps Dansguardian can do that.  This is a medical office,
there will be anatomical words and even "nekkid pichers"
going by, so content-based filtering probably won't work.

After that, my biggest concern is that one of the half dozen
corporate sites this path talks gets 0wned.  Typically, though,
replication of viral software involves strange connections to
other sites to download more of the exploit, and subsequent
control, which the tool can easily forbid.  The other concern
is DNS poisoning, with (for example) update.microsoft.com 
pointing to a zombied machine in Korea.  I use Google's
8.8.8.8 for name service, and Level 3's depreciated 4.2.2.1
as a backup.  If they both have DNS problems, we're hosed.

I've written a little Perl backend filter for tcpdump. It builds
a list of IP /24s that this LAN has talked to.  When a new one
comes along, perhaps because one of the corporate sites has added
some IP addresses for their servers, I log it but don't create
a path through the firewall for it until I've checked it out.  
A few hours delay for some tasks, perhaps, but the Windoze box
will only be powered and on the net a few hours per week anyway.

BTW, the Windoze box doesn't directly interact with any other 
machines in the office besides the firewall.  The backup drive
and the printer are USB, on a two port USB switch.  I may use
a portion of the backup drive as a mailbox for files.  There
is no way that the Windoze machine, even if 0wned, can get at
the crown jewels on the other LAN, Linux boxes that mostly
talk encrypted to each other.  Me, paranoid?

Thanks again;

Keith
