Message-ID: <50BA2D80.1050901@fredjame.cnc.net>

All
I opened a root console on my Mageia2 KDE4 desktop and got a new message 
I had not seen before ... to the effect that .../gpg.conf was in an 
unsafe configuration.

I temporarily (at least) solved the problem by moving gpg.conf to 
gpg.conf.hold

I searched messages and syslog for the last 3 days but I don't see 
anything that matches gpg ... in short I am having a bit of trouble 
figuring out why the file should be there at all

Any thoughts?  Thanks
Regards
Fred James

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1212010925280.22903@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I installed ubuntu-12.10 on a Toshiba Satellite portable which is to be
sent to someone across the country. Wireless networking has always worked on
this host, but wired networking did not. I need to test the wired networking
before it's packaged and shipped and would like assistance from a ubuntu
expert.

   It's a full, vanilla installation; I just let it do its own thing. Ergo,
no network setup with a host name or static IP address. I don't run a DHCP
server here since there are only a handful of hosts and static IP addresses
have worked just fine for many years.

   This ubuntu seems very Microsoft-ish; there is a row of icons on the left
side and I have not found how to open a terminal window to try to figure out
what's not working. Sigh.

   Can wired networking be tested without my setting up a dhcp server
locally?

   How can I find a virtual console on this host? With the xubuntu it
replaced there was no problem with having everything hidden, but this
stymies me.

TIA,

Rich

gpg.conf shoud have permissions of 600 and be owned by your UID.

Rich,

Using Unity, you can start typing the word Terminal and your choices 
should show on the screen.  A keyboard shortcut that works in Ubuntu is, 
Ctrl-Alt-T.

Here is a quick reference for a few tips:

Every file (directories not included) within that directory is set to 600.
Additional Information:
     There are 3 users accounts on this machine ...
         One I use all the time ... this one has the issue as stated above
         Two I use sometimes for testing ... it has a .gpg.conf 
directory, but not this issue or file
         Three has not been used as yet ... it does not have a .gpg.conf 
directory at all
I have read that this may have to do with email encryption?
My email client is SeaMonkey, which is only installed in account One.
Maybe that just muddies the water?
Thanks

Subject: [PLUG] Can't Receive Mail
Message-ID: <50BA4BE8.6070209@gisnet.com>

Hello folks,

I'm setting up a new CentOS 64-bit machine and have nearly got mail 
working, except I can't send mail to myself from outside the LAN it's 
on. When I try I get this error message:

"An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded:  5.1.1 
<bthoen at visualfarms.com>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in 
virtual alias table. Please check the message recipient 
bthoen at visualfarms.com and try again."

I can send mail from that address, no problem. I'm using the latest 
Dovecot and Postfix. I've tried setting an alias in etc/aliases like so:
bthoen: bthoen at visualfarms.com

and pointing local_recipient_maps in main.cf at it. I also tried leaving 
that empty. Also did 'service postfix restart' and 'service dovecot 
restart' whenever I disturbed  their config files.

The log says that dovecot connects and disconnects OK, but I'm so new to 
this end of the business that I probably don't see half of what I should 
notice. Here's the last few log entries as I tried to login via Thunderbird:

Dec  1 10:16:02 oneimage dovecot: IMAP(bthoen): Disconnected: Logged out
Dec  1 10:51:48 oneimage dovecot: imap-login: Login: user=<bthoen>,

Dec  1 10:51:48 oneimage dovecot: IMAP(bthoen): maildir: 
root=/home/bthoen/Maildir, index=/home/bthoen/Maildir, control=, inbox=

I've read lots of article on Dovecot, Postfix and related from Googlets 
-- not understanding a lot of it. And I don't know what would be 
relevant to display here for help. This is probably dead simple to an 
experienced sysadmin, but my experienced SA got a real job in another 
state and is no longer as free to freelance as before. So I have to 
learn enough to make this work in the short term, and hopefully more 
will sink in in the long run.

Any help, references to articles, or requests for some information to 
diagnose what's wrong would be much appreciated.

TIA,
Bill Thoen

Bill,

It sounds like Postfix doesn't know it's supposed to accept mail for
your domain.  Make sure that visualfarms.com is in the mydestination=
line in main.cf and restart the service if you have to add it. If that
doesn't work, it might be helpful to see the whole main.cf (you can
obfuscate anything you don't want to share, though I can't think of
anything in there that would be sensitive.)

Nvidia-173 and 295 are absolutely antique.  You'll need to check the 
exact card models to make sure you load the correct drivers. for 
Example, in a terminal:

sudo /sbin/lspci

should display what cards the kernel picks up.In my case,

01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation GF108 [GeForce GT 
430] (rev a1)

You might have better luck with

http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-ia32-310.19-driver

or

http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-ia32-304.64-driver

for the NVS 285.

Also, make sure any motherboard GPU is disabledandthat the nouveau 
kernel module(open source driver) is blacklisted. Anyway, that's about 
all I can suggest since I run Slackware!  Ubuntu is just too damn 
windowy for my taste!

For a terminal, top left of icon row, click Ubuntu symbol at the top.  
you should get a window (translucent) at the top left.  This is for apps 
access. There should be a search bar.  Type "terminal" and select as 
appropriate.  You'll need to use "sudo" as in  "sudo /sbin/lspci" and 
"sudo /sbin/lsmod" to check for hardware and modules.  Same goes for 
ifconfig.

On the upper right, on the task bar, you should see an icon  (greyed 
up/down arrow or wifi radio symbol if that is running).  It is the same 
network manager that ships with Slackware 14.  left (or right?) click -  
edit connections.  And so forth.  You should be able to set up a static 
IP just to make sure the wired connection and driver are working.  Of 
course, if the wired ethernet port driver is not loaded you will have to 
find one in Ubuntu repos or wherever.

Also, since you are a slack guy IIRC, you can run the virtual guided 
tour here:

http://www.ubuntu.com/tour/en/#

Might help figure out Unity desktop without having to damage you 
install. I gotta say, I am not crazy about Unity.  You've taxed what 
little knowledge I have about it.

Being what it is here's a very simple and basic test you can do.

1. Run the command  "ping 127.0.0.1" from the command line while not
connected to any networks. This will test the NIC, the NIC drivers and the
tcp/.ip stack.

2. If the computer will be using DHCP on the Ethernet interface it's in
your best interest to test DHCP functionality. The modem/router in your
home from your ISP will have a DHCP server running. If there's not extra
ports, just disconnect your wireless router from it and connect the
computer. If Eth0 is configured to get an ip address from DHCP and DHCP
client on the computer is working correctly, the computer should be
allocated an ip address.

Hope that's helpful.

hi plug folks,

while this isn't directly related to linux/unix, i'm looking for 
reco's/info on a solid *locally owned* and managed colo facility to rack 
a 1U server for the Ubuntu Oregon group.

My goals are:

get down there during normal business hours
Location: within an hour's drive of hillsboro, i don't wanna have to go 
to the dalles, vancouver, or salem
Remote hands: in the event that things go sideways, is it possible to 
get a kvm hooked up or a manual power cycle without incurring exorbitant 
expenses?
Reliability: solid network and reliable power, failover plans for both.

thanks in advance!

As is my old card.

As this is a machine to test things, dual head was just an experiment. I 
had forgotten that the reason I bought the card I have in this machine. 
lspci gives only the following information regarding just which card 
that is:

01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation Device 10c3 (rev a2)

I do know that it has 512 MB on it, versus 64 MB on the old Quadro NVS 285.

Anyway, back to my experiments. My objective is to have 12.04 provide 
all the software functionality I have with 10.04. I appreciated seeing 
all the comments about getting the "old" Gnome back. I will probably use 
that.

Thanks for all the advice.

This is the log for dovecot. That's what you connect to to pick up mail that is already delivered. You are having issues with mail delivery. We need to see what's in the postfix log, as that's the program telling you that it's not accepting the mail. 

I agree with James that it sounds like postfix doesn't know it's supposed to accept email for you.

Are you sure about that? I was under the impression that no NIC is required to have a loopback (127.x.x.x) network interface. It's a software only interface. The only thing that will test is the tcp/ip stack.

Sorry, I tried to send the main.cf file yesterday, but it exceeds this 
forum's limits for a single message. So I'm posting main.cf with only 
the settings as I have them. This is followed by a more precise log of 
events. I'll start looking into Postfix  a little more carefullly and 
see if I can spot (and recognize) the error.  But Postfix must be 
working somewhat at least because messaghes sent locally do get  
delivered correctly. I still need some help.

That is my understanding as well. You always have have "localhost" ie 
loopback even with no NIC hardware installed.  This is used, for 
example, to access the CUPS printer web interface (http://localhost:631 
-This assumes you set up /etc/hosts with "127.0.0.1   localhost" during 
installation/configuration).

The only way to test the NIC is to load the driver module, see if 
ifconfig seems an interface and then try to set up the interface.

Subject: [PLUG] question on strange thread freeze
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHc=VVLd-MVMSBxABpQ1_YPJjJ6aYB-7fad=AZ-B2mj73A@mail.gmail.com>

To pthread gurus:

I am using pthreads and run 2 threads under it during the day, and
each thread does activity every 1/5 second.  This works great on my
8-core system, but occasionally I have a thread freeze (and yes, it
froze both threads) that lasts longer than 1/5 of a second.

Is there any good way to troubleshoot this freeze?  I cannot imagine
what is going on with the OS, so that the threads are suspended for
over 1/5 second, but apparently that is what is occurring (I do have
timestamping)

Do I need to set the priority of the threads to a very high priority
so that the kernal keeps them active?

No, I'm not. I can find a definitive answer nor can I confirm nor deny with
my own testing. When I stopped the networking sevice, only the lo interface
was visible with ifconfig and it responded with a ping. When I unloaded the
NIC drive via modprobe -r, both eth0 and lo were visible via ifconfig and
lo responded to a ping.

So, I'll restate my testing procedure.

1. Run the command "lspci | grep Network" to verify the Ethernet controller
is seen by the pci bus and get info on it.

lspci | grep Network
00:19.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82566MM Gigabit Network
Connection (rev 03)

2. dmesg | grep Network

4. At this point eth0 should be up and visible when you run the ifconfig
command and the interface should be ip addressable either manually or via
dhcp.

5. At this point a ping test is mostly trivial. If it fails, you can be
confident that it's not a NIC hardware or driver issue, but an ip network
config issue to include DHCP issues.

I'm fairly certain there is some interaction with the NIC when pinging the
127.0.0.1 interface.

lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
          RX packets:13122 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:13122 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0
          RX bytes:1262573 (1.2 MB)  TX bytes:1262573 (1.2 MB)

If I take down the interface with "ifdown lo" then 127.0.0.1 is not
pingable.

Localhost is just a reference to the lo network interface. Someone running
Linux on a desktop computer would have to physically remove the NIC to
verify the "no nic necessary to ping 127.0.0.1" theory.

What is your public ip for that server? 

When I do an MX lookup for vfarms.com, I don't see anything, i.e. it doesn't exist. When I look up the mx for visualfarms.com, I see 192.231.196.244. If that's your IP, and you configure postfix to accept mail for 'visualfarms.com' either in addition to, or instead of vfarms.com, then it should start working. If that's not your IP address, then you need to configure your DNS to point to the right server. 

Also, those postfix logs are from two different machines. www and oneimage.

I was going to suggest Fry's, but failing that, there's Graybar.

Did you run the newaliases command after you updated main.cf?  I
didn't see that in the thread, and it is needed after updating Postfix
aliases.

Vfarms.com is actually visualfarms.com. I was going to obfuscate it a bit and then I realized that wouldn't matter but I forgot change it back. So I did have it right in the configuration. The proof is that a friend of mine has been able to send me mail today, and it gets through no problem.

The reason those log reports are from different machines is that I can send myself mail when logged in locally, but not remotely. The logs show what I get from each machine.

So i don't know what I hosed up, but it appears to be specific to my accounts. Any suggestions for a step by step test suite to find he problem? I can email myself locally, but not from a different network. I can send mail out to anybody, and apparently anybody (except me) can send mail to me at visualfarms.com. Maybe I should be focusing on how I set up firefox to log in to get mail? That wasn't very clear to me either.

I just sent you an email to bthoen at visualfarms.com which my
server log says was delivered successfully.  So it appears
mail delivery from "outside" is working.

Did you get the direct email?

Can you clarify from where mail delivery is failing?

So, by remotely, do you mean 'another machine on the visualfarms.com network'?

Ctrl Alt + T and yes you will need either dhcp or to assign and static IP
and setup routing otherwise the host won't know how to connect which is
nothing to do with Ubuntu but has everything to do with the Network Stack.

You can use the newer nvidia ppa that the Ubuntu Desktop Team has for Steam
that should bump you to the latest. The ppa name slips my mind.

The arp table in each host maps the ip addrs to mac addrs of all the
devices on the same ip net.  When you ping an ip address on the same ip
net, an arp table look up is performed to get the mac address and then the
packets are "routed" to the destination mac addr.

This is applicable even if you have the wireless and wired interface
connected to different LANs, as long as you're connecting to a host on the
same ip net.

"Two hosts on the same ip network don't use any
routing protocols. A default gateway is not needed either."

<pedant>
Two hosts on the same network *segment* (physical, and logical) often don't
need routing or gateways. You can. however, have a large network (or even a
small one) that requires a router. Example:
Host a) 10.2.0.10/255.255.255.0
Host b) 10.3.0.10/255.255.255.0
</pedant>

The linux networking stack may be more forgiving, and just pump out
"who-has" requests and get a MAC back, but as I read the specs, each host
above *should* only search in their respective 255.255.255.0 space to build
their ARP table,.. but I may be reading it wrong, and welcome correction.

Your message arrived just as it should have. And I see you got my 
response. Then I tried good old Mail from a Linux box on a different 
network and successfully sent mail to my account on the new server. 
Worked perfectly. THen on the same machine I tried to set up a second 
account to this server using Thunderbird. No dice. I couldn't make a 
connection, or when I did, I get errors

So now I think the problem is a misconfigured Thunderbird. I need to 
read up on SSL/TLS or STARTTLS and various kinds of password methods, 
none of which I can see in the server's config. At this point Idon't 
even know what I dont know so it's hard to ask the right questions. I'm 
going to study it some more, and if I don' t get it I'll be back 
hopefully with a little better grip on the problem. Thanks for the help 
so far!

Don't know why I didn't think of this earlier.  along with ifconfig, you 
can use ethtool for NIC hardware diagnostics.

Subject: [PLUG] Need to prevent accidental data destruction
Message-ID: <005b01cdd249$293a13d0$7bae3b70$@martinconsulting.com>

Hey Pluggers,

The only think I hate worse than unscheduled downtime is data loss, and I
have a situation where it would be very easy to accidentally destroy a lot
of data very quickly.  I'd like to see if anyone has a clever idea about
preventing this from happening.

Here's the situation:
1) I have a current Linux system running as a host to virtual machines.
2) I have a hardware RAID (call it /dev/sdb) holding many terabytes of data.

3) /dev/sdb has no partition table, and is formatted as an entire-disk file
system, if that matters
4) /dev/sdb is attached to one of the virtual machines (also current Linux),
which reads and writes files on /dev/sdb regularly

So far, so good, and everything works.  Here's the scenario I'm worried
about:  an accidental mount of /dev/sdb on the host system, either via
typing in the wrong window or during some maintenance task when the virtual
machine is thought to be shut down but isn't,  will corrupt that file system
and lead to the possible loss of all those terabytes of data.

Yes, I have backups (which might take days to restore), and yes there's a
chance I could recover some or all of the data with various tools, but those
are fixing a problem.  I want to avoid the problem altogether.  Can any of
you think of a clever way to provide a layer of protection around opening
the device from the host level?  SELinux, perhaps?

create a non-root-privilege account and use sudo to perform any necessary
maintenance. only give access to the needed commands via sudo and nothing
more.

Perhaps I could've been a bit more specific with my wording. When I say ip
net, I mean ip subnet, which is
what you're referring to with "255.255.255.0".

It's not about searching in their respective space either. Arp is a
broadcast, broadcasts happen ip subnet wide just
like DHCP requests. Routers which provide connectivity between ip subnets
don't pass broadcasts.

I've used ethtool in the past for getting wireless card and drive info but
I'd never used it for NIC self-test purposes. I tried it and I have to
admit I'm not entirely impressed with the results as I ran it offline mode
(default) and it resulted in a FAIL because the link test failed which
seems to me shouldn't be tested in offline mode. But it does confirm that
the NIC is at least responding to commands through the driver

root at mannix:/home/mike# ethtool -t eth0 offline
The test result is FAIL
The test extra info:
Register test  (offline) 0
Eeprom test    (offline) 0
Interrupt test (offline) 0
Loopback test  (offline) 0
Link test   (on/offline) 1

So, do linux boxen (as mentioned above) do a "who has" broadcast if they
are looking for an IP outside of their subnet?

Message-ID: <CAEtu1Uf-iKhBAFbR6x6g1g2q+p3Zk_1kgTt_2_2-F6TZ-DkczQ@mail.gmail.com>

Reading through the threads I realized this has become somewhat of a
convoluted topic. I wanted to figure out a sure-fire, quick and simple
approach not only for Rich but for myself and others that could be followed
and would help folks determine where the problem might be.

So here's the method, I've come up with.

1. Run the command "ifconfig" from a terminal shell.
   It the command results show an "eth" interface with a "HWaddr" then the
OS sees the NIC. Which means the NIC drvier module is loaded. Go to step 5
*
*
*ifconfig eth0*
*eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:1c:25:18:3c:78  *
*          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1*
*          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0*
*          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0*
*          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 *
*          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)*
*          Interrupt:20 Memory:fe000000-fe020000 *

2. If you don't see any "eth" interfaces listed then run the command "dmesg
| grep Ethernet" to get information on the physical card

*lspci | grep Ethernet*
*00:19.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82566MM Gigabit Network
Connection (rev 03)*
*
*
3.* *Then run the command "dmesg | grep Network" to get driver information
*
*
*dmesg | grep Network*
*[    1.382194] e1000e: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Driver - 1.5.1-k*
*
*
4. Then run the command "lsmod | grep <network driver>". In this example
the command would be "lsmod | grep e1000e"

If not, you've got a NIC driver problem. You can try to load the driver
manually via the "modprobe" command or do some research to find the right
driver.

5. The simplest, quickest and easiest way I can think of to actually test
the NIC, driver and network config is to either connect it to a LAN with a
DHCP server or directly to a router that is handing out DHCP addresses or
connect it to another computer via a cross-over cable and configure
statically assigned ip addresses on the both computers.

5A. Connect either a cross-over cable between two computers or connect a
regular straight through Ethernet cable to ether a LAN jack or directly to
a hub/switch/router and check to see that you get a link light on your NIC
to very the card, the cable and the other device is functional before doing
an ip connectivity test.

I often use the following ip addr scheme for internal testing between
devices.

Device #1 ip addr = 1.2.3.4. / 255.255.255.0
Device #2 ip addr = 1.2.3.5. / 255.255.255.0

5B. Then do a simple ping test to either the other computer (no routing /
gateway config needed) or to the default gateway address that is provided
by the DHCP server or router. This can be found by running the command
"route -n". Just look for the "Gateway" address for the Network Interface
your're working on. It should also have the "G" flag, (gateway), set.

*Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use
Iface*
*0.0.0.0         192.168.0.1       0.0.0.0               UG     0       0
      0     eth0*

I hope this helpful. It can be easily adopted for wireless testing too.

If you consider Hillsboro "local", PCH Cables has a few rack items by

Or simply search "rack" on their main page: http://www.pchcables.com

(Really off-topic) but you are running a old version of e1000e, the
latest is version 2.1.4 :-)

This self-test is only as good as the driver implementation.  Each
driver is left up to implementing the ethtool self-test command and I
personally do not know of any wireless driver that does an extensive
implementation.  As far as the Intel wired Ethernet drivers, I know we
implemented all the tests so that the results are actually helpful.

This is just an FYI, so if you have issues with the self-test of a
particular card, then it is not ethtool's fault, it is the driver's
fault. :-)

I had written "rotate magnet to center trace". The tech who 
was testing my procedure came back with the complaint that 
the trace would just move around, not to, the center. He had 
a few more years total experience than I but had never 
worked on TV's.

I had never mentioned that the relative position of the 
"ears" could be adjusted. "Everyone" knew that ;/

Things can be simpler here.   ifconfig won't list devices that have not
been up at least once.
replace it with 'the command ip link".  I haven't tested recently but I
also believe that any ethernet
devices known by the kernel via pci bus even without a configured driver
will be identified.

I just found it confusing that the final test result was FAIL when all the
internal tests passed and the link test failed. I ran the test in offline
mode with no eth cable connected and I assumed the link test wouldn't be
tested in the offline mode. Ethtool ran the same tests and returned the
same results I the same results in online mode.

Ah, I didn't know that about ifconfig. I removed the e1000e driver with
modprobe -r, verified it wasn't loaded with lsmod and ip link didn't list
itl

 ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 16436 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

    link/ether 00:1d:e0:00:89:53 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

So, we're still at the age old, thorny juncture of what's the quickest and
easiest way to determine if the source of one's networking problem is the
driver or the NIC. Based on my own experiences working as a Network
Engineer and Linux user for many years, I always look at the driver and net
config first as I've found a greater probability the problem is there than
with the hardware.

I finally solved this one. Turned out that I had some old settings from 
when visualfarms.com was a virtual domain under my first server. When I 
moved it to its own machine and didn't getrid of the old settings, 
whenever I tried to send mail to visualfarms.com, the old settings

Subject: [PLUG] Proposal: A PLUG Code of Conduct
Message-ID: <50C22DD0.5030608@ambidexter.com>


Hello all,

In light of a contentious on-list discussion in October 2011 and PLUG's 
traditional lack of diversity, I am of the opinion that the group should 
have a code of conduct. This need not be complex but is an important 
formality in this splendidly-informal community.

In the case of the contentious on-list discussion, several people, 
myself included suggested that "you know it when you see it", as was 
certainly the case in that situation. While that assertion does not 
constitute a policy, I would like to explore strategies for a simple 
policy that has the hooks, however simple, to the summoning of law 
enforcement if necessary.

Considering that the pursuit of software/technology freedom should begin 
in school and last a lifetime, I have been exploring two ideas:

1. A subset of Robert Fulghum's "All I Really Need To Know I Learned In 
Kindergarten", such as:

Share everything. (!)
Play fair.
Don't hit people.
Clean up your own mess.
Don't take things that aren't yours.
Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody.
Live a balanced life -
Learn some and think some
And play and work everyday some.
Be aware of wonder.

2. An adjusted version of the Portland Public Schools anti-bullying 
policies (kudos to the schools for finally taking this seriously):

http://www.pps.k12.or.us/departments/student-services/372.htm

Kudos to Keith for pointing out last night how one company effectively 
leveraged a school teacher for running developer meetings.

HOPEFULLY we all learned these social skills at home and in 
preschool/school but we humans all occasionally lapse.

Thoughts?

Threads spin out of control all the time -- usually going off-topic, 
but occasionally going off-color -- but deleting threads is about the 
easiest thing to do in a decent e-mail client.

Once the sociopath and his overly earnest (or perhaps likewise 
sociopathic) correspondent realize the room is empty of spectators, 
they go home.

+1.

Even if they don't realize it, eventually they tire out. I've gotten in my
fair share of useless debates over the years, and the delete key always
proved to be the most powerful solution.

I concur.  While I wasn'ton this list during the period in question, 
Flame wars pop up all the time online, whether on USENET, IRC, webforums 
or mail lists., etc. They can often be amusing. Amusing, or not, 
deleting/blocking the offending parties is easy enough. "Don't feed the 
troll."  A "morality police" is not needed.  After all, its all just 
words:  "Stick and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt 
me."  I sometimes think we are getting too sensitive as a culture when 
we take offense and wish to prosecute what we have termed "verbal abuse" 
as though we were physically injured in the attack. Although this may be 
valid in person, when online, insulting language and "screaming" in all 
CAPS is easily ignored as it just does not have the same impact.

I don't know much about video editing: I know that there is "linear

means, I want software that'll let me arbitrarily splice any length
chunks of video from any compatible file into the finished job, then

Stills may be nice, a way to do titling would be very nice, special

LET THE PUBLIC RECORD SHOW THAT THIS TOPIC HAS BEEN RAISED, DISCUSSED 
AND THAT CONSENSUS ON THE MATTER HAS BEEN ACHIEVED THAT REFLECTS 
PREVAILING SENTIMENTS.

And try not to be a jerk.

I recommend kdenlive .

It even opens up MKVs directly (I make anime music videos as a hobby,
and most recent releases, i.e, fansubs, are compressed using mkv.)

MKVs are a PITB for every othe windows-based system I have ever run;
the Adobe suite, VirtualDub, you name it. kdenlive is a dream for this.
You just drag 'n' drop, and you can start splicing.

Same goes for mp4s.

Good luck,

I agree with all of the sentiments above with the exception of " I
would like to explore strategies for a simple policy that has the
hooks, however simple, to the summoning of law
enforcement if necessary."

I think it's fine to publish a code of conduct and encourage people to
conduct themselves in  ways of communication that are non-violent,
non-abusive, collaborative, helpful and serve to foster community.

Should a situation arise where there is a threat of physical violence
then it is up to the individual to do what they feel is appropriate
for their own well-being and safety. That could range from removing
oneself from the email list, deleting/blocking emails, consulting with
admins or long term list users in attempt to mediate or to act as
witness, and contacting the authorities on your own behalf.

The two most popular, and probably most capable, are Kino and Avidemux,
both of which will be in the repos for most fully configured distros.
I've used them both, Kino more than Avidemux, but I am far from an
expert. Mostly I use them to convert an 8 GB blueray movie to something
that I can cram on an ordinary DVD. 

Also, I hope you have a fairly fast computer or lots of patience.

The very fact that it's been over a year without a similar incident suggests that the problem has resolved itself. 

I believe that very few people are that contentious, at least in this community. Given the makeup of this group and it's history, I would doubt that any code of conduct would be binding, and at that point, we would cease to be the group we are, and would henceforth be more of a club. We would then need to have more formal 'gatekeepers'. While that's not always a bad thing, I think, at this point, it would be for this group.

I would recommend kdenlive or openshot. Kdenline can pull data from
web cams and firewire.  Both are fairly simple to master.

Kino is good, but no longer maintained. More usefull for firewire
cameras, dvgrab is the CLI version.

Cinelerra is way to complex for the hobbyist/casual user.

I would argue that there are countless unwritten rules but that, based 
on feedback, they are doing very well remaining unwritten.

Subject: [PLUG] RHEL selinux-policy packages
Message-ID: <50C28031.6090608@seitzassoc.com>


While setting up email on a CentOS 6.3 machine, I encountered a
problem with dovecot access to maildir directories.  It seems that I'm
running into this Redhat bug, "selinux policy prevents dovecot domains
access to mail_home_rw_t (Maildir)".
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=836241

Today I decided to build my own selinux-policy package to work around
the problem.  However, I also stumbled onto what appears to be the
latest and greatest RHEL 6 policy package from Redhat.
http://people.redhat.com/dwalsh/SELinux/RHEL6/noarch/

Does anyone have an opinion as to whether I should use my own modified
package, or the new but not released one from Redhat?  There is, of
course, a third, knee-jerk option, which would be to disable selinux,
but I'm trying to avoid that.

thanks,
galen

Given that the new package isn't released yet, I'd say stick with what
you've got.  Always assuming that your fix works.  :-)  I don't use Dovecot or Centos, so I can't really say more.

Just my $0.02.

Message-ID: <20121208061540.GA15715@gate.kl-ic.com>

For bimonthly movie night, my wife and I watched "Absurdistan".
The title is apt.  Director Veit Helmer recently made "Baikonur",
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iK464i6tzw
a drama filmed at the active Kazakh/Russian launch center, which
I would like to see.  Amazon sells the DVD for PAL region 2,
which is incompatable with my Hollywood-infested DVD player.

Will a PAL region 2 disk play using Linux DVD player software?
Will the English subtitles display?  I'm guessing this can be
set up with a lot of effort,  but many tweaks may be needed,
and frame-rate incompatabilities leading to ugly video.

I do not know the answer to this question, but a few years ago when I
bought a DVD player I first searched on the net to find one that I
would be able to reconfigure to play DVDs from anywhere. I cannot
remember the process I went through (hold down <button> while powering
on ... etc.), but the DVD player will now play any DVD from anywhere.
There are region codes. and the DVD players sold in the US will (by
default) play only those that the people behind DRM think you ought to
play. My dim recollection is that 0 is the code for "anywhere,
unrestricted," but don't quote me. Once you know the code then you need
the secret incantations to change the code on your player. Most can be
set to play DVDs from anywhere, but only Mr. Google knows the proper
spell to make a given make and model do so.

As for playing them on a Linux machine, I've never tried it. If I have
a DVD that, for some reason, refuses to play, I convert it to AVI using
Kino or something, and then play the AVI. This is probably a DRM
violation, but I paid for the damn movie, so my conscience is clear.

Note: Kino will take a couple hours to convert a movie to AVI on my
computer. Don't be in a hurry.

My little dab of anecdotal evidence: I bought a Czech movie direct
from Prague on DVD, which arrived and played fine on my linux box.
Never released here. The english title was "Sekal has to die".  I saw
it twice at the PIFF in the pre-parenthood-golden-age-of-cinema, then
waited another ~10-ish years to see it again on the DVD.

FWIW, my 5(+/-) year old COBY stand alone player has a PAL/NTSC 
switch that controls the OUTPUT independently of the DVD format! 
Don't know about the region BS.

Thanks

here is a good resource for unlocking the region code for your dvd player.

I have been able to watch Japanese dvds on my Linux box with no issues and
they too are region code 2.

And there is a hack for my ancient Philips DVP642 DVD player.  Yay!
Also, my Infocus LP70 computer projector will do PAL (different
than NTSC, my main worry).  I may have to temporarily pull my
closed-captioned-for-the-hearing-impaired box out of the loop.

That is good to know, as fallback if the DVD player and
computer projector don't work as expected.  Thanks to you,
John, Jim, and other helpful responders.

I can order that German DVD with confidence that one of two
options will work.  I'll tell you how it goes.  Perhaps I
will invite folks over for Rocket Drama Movie Night and the
premiere Oregon screening of "Baikonur". 

BTW, OT, our movie night two weeks ago was "3 Idiots", a Hindi
comedy based on Chetan Bhagat's loosely autobiographical novel
"5 Point Someone".  This is about college students struggling
to survive at the Indian Institute of Technology, and laugh-
your-ass-off funny.  Geek humor at its best!

Hollywood, not so much.

Forgot one:  PiTiVi is actually pretty decent, similar to Openshot but 
built on gstreamer framework. It claims to conform to the GNOME Human 
Interface Guidelines if you are one of those gnomishtypes.

Just another ideato add to all the others:

I use dvd::rip (and previously k9copy but development has stopped), to 
ripDVDs I purchase to be region,macrovisionand css free.  Either of 
these programs allows a straight copy to DVD iso. I then use K3B to burn 
a dvd.  This new DVD will play on anything!  I put the iso on a network 
drive to then streamit to the TV via a linux box (NTSC vs PAL not 
relavent using vlc or mplayer with the proper libraries installed). All 
thison Slackware with a region 1 dvd9 DVDRW-DL playerinstalled in to the 
computer.  Usually only takes 1-2 hrs  to rip and burn, depending on the 
size of the movie. Interestingly enough, most DVD players in the last 5 
yrs will play both PAL and NTSC content once you strip the region code 
from the DVD.  Both my JVC and Phillips DVD players dont' seem to have a 
problem.

Note re: changing region code on computer DVDRW or standalone 
DVDplayers. IIRC, you get only 5 changes.  So if you can't sent the 
player to "region free" you should leave itat region 1 and change the 
region of the DVD.

As long as you use a distro like Mint that comes with libdvdcss2 included,
all you have to do is use vlc, & you can play PAL DVDs of any region with
subtitles.  No special setup needed, & no loss in quality. Or run Mint live
for each movie night, if you prefer.  I have added libdvdcss2 to many
distros, & it rarely works, if added.  It always works with a distro like
Mint where it is built into the distro.  This is much easier than trying to
make your stand-alone DVD player region free.  Mint 13 KDE LTS is the
version I recommend, but any version of mint should work.

Cheers,

Elcaset

Subject: [PLUG] ntpd problems on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS questions
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHffa6AS9C44kDQVj-sBGCBSzU_OCWPGe5GgQFpyRvi2dQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am looking for someone proficient in both apparmor and ntpd on Ubuntu 12.04

Apparmor is interfering with the correct operation of ntp and
needlessly restricting operations.  I am attemting to run an
ntp-client, but I have been forced to edit both the ntp.conf file, as
is a general rule, and the apparmor profile located in the
/ect/apparmor.d folder area, specifically the usr.sbin.ntpd profile.

I had to add 2 capabilities, mknod and dac_override, to permit ntpd to
do the mknod operation and to rename a destination file, since the
syslog contained complaints from apparmor about ntpd activities.

But I cannot get peerstats nor loopstats to save more than 10 days of
data without erasing the 11th day.  I need to keep these files for all
days of the year, not just the last 10. (I suspect this is an ntp
problem)

If you are proficient in setting up ntpd on a Ubuntu system, I would
like to communicate with you and compare configurations.

Thanks for considering my request.

- Randall

I love that movie! One of my favorites! But I'm also an engineer, so
it held extra attraction for me. I had no idea it was based on a book,
though. I'll have to track that down and read it. Thanks for letting
me know that!

I'll note the easy workaround, if you're not tied to a certain 
directory name:

  1. mv $HOME/Maildir to $HOME/maildir
  2. update your MTA and Dovecot configs,
  3. run fixfiles or restorecon,
  4. voila!

In our setup, Dovecot has no trouble whatsoever in a directory typed 
as user_home_t, as ~/maildir is.

NTP uses generation file sets and scripts for managing continuous, long

Hi

I have fallen behind in my disk usage  knowledge..

So something has happen and I don't quite know how to fix it.

My initial problem was that /home was running out of room..

So I created a new directory /home2 and created a new partition on my
terabyte drive.   Formatted the partition.  Added an entry in
/etc/fstab.  I used the old technology.  Used /dev/sdd5  instead of
the uuid #.  Which I don't know how to determine.

Anyway.  I did an update and needed to reboot the computer..

On rebooting..  All the drives are renamed.  /dev/sda is now /dev/sdc
and all kinds of stuff..

Luckily the system still works.  Don't know why..

How do I find out the uuid # on the partition I just created so I can
make the right entry in /etc/fstab?

TIA

Marvin

On Ubuntu, just type "blkid" and it will spit out the UUID of each of the
partitions.

Do you have a GUI tool?  What distro and version?
In the absents of a GUI have you looked at fdisk and the like?

Hi All

Just used blkid at the command line.

Edited /etc/fstab..

Rebooted and life is good..

Thanks for all the reply?s.  This list is the best.

I am using Ubuntu 12.4

Chris,  Thanks for the heads-up on hardware raid.
I did some poking around and will definitely go with software raid.
The whole idea behind the 3rd disk is disaster recovery.  Since you can
periodically swap one of the raid-1 drives in the system with the drive on
the shelf, it gives you the ability to recovery quickly to a point in time.
Q: Have you been able to recover using your rsnapshot data on the usb drive?

A: I've found a lot that don't, in my searches.  I'm wondering why would you
want to tie yourself to a specific motherboard? (hardware raid volumes are
very rarely usable on other breeds of card than the one they were made
on--sometimes even same-brand is not enough, it must be same firmware
revision!) The beauty of linux s/w raid is that in 10 years, you can still
put those disks in whatever machine is available (with a "legacy" sata card)
and reassemble the raid.  i have rebuilt my raid on my underpowered (was
VIA, now Atom, both fanless single core machines) fileserver a whole lot in
the past 8 months (due to a failing hard drive that kept working for long
enough to rebuild before erroring out and requiring another rebuild) and the
speed of the rebuild has been pretty close to disk speed despite these
servers not being optimized for I/O - i regularly get 110MB/s rebuilds on
modern 2TB drives (the cheapest ones i could find though!)  plus, my systems
have been pretty usable while the raid rebuilds--they only serve pretty
small stuff except the occasional "fire up virtualbox off a networked drive
to run windows for 5 minutes" and that definitely gets prioritized over raid
rebuilds (you can tweak the settings from the command line for s/w raid
rebuild speed and priority)--so i basically don't notice additional lag
during rebuild (vs the 100mbit network fileservice speed anyway)

The real problem I think you'll have is that raid 1 is about 2 disks--i
don't know a way to proactively mirror that third disk while the first 2 are
working.  maybe some h/w raid solutions have this, but linux s/w raid
doesn't have a concept of 3-way mirroring (unless you have 4 drives and have
a mirrored-mirror kind of thing) so here's the way things will go:

- you have a 2 drive raid.
- you mdadm --add md0 /dev/otherdrive
- you now have a 2 drive raid with an empty hotspare
- you pull a working drive
- you wait hours to rebuild the new drive from the one that's still spinning
and hope you don't have a failure of that first drive during this process,
since you'll lose data from the last 2 hours.

My 3-drive system is like this:

2 drive mirrored array (have /boot and / mirrored separately from my data
partition so i can upgrade the OS without touching my data partition

1 external usb drive for use with rsnapshot which is online backups with
months of history for not much extra drive space.  If I'm going on vacation,
i unplug the USB drive and take it with me or anyway make sure it's not
vulnerable to fire/theft/lightning at the same time as the rest of my
system.

Not trying to poo-poo your idea, but wondering if having the solution in
mind instead of the problem (what problem are you trying to solve with the
constant drive swaps, esp if you keep the other drive next to the computer?)
might be narrowing your field of possibilities.

luck++;

A reasonable goal which I solve with rsnapshot =)

> Q: Have you been able to recover using your rsnapshot data on the usb drive?

I've never tried a full recovery (I use it to recover old
versions/deleted files primarily), but since it is (several) full
copies of the filesystem, a simple "cp -Rp" or rsync would do the
trick.  To be clear, I can at this second browse (or fully recover) my
"big data" partition as it looked at the following times:

drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jul 21 13:04 monthly.2
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Aug  4 13:05 monthly.1

drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Dec  6 13:04 daily.6
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Dec  7 13:05 daily.5
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Dec  8 13:03 daily.4

It's not a drive image or anything, so you need to reinstall OS upon
drive failure if the drive held your / partition as well before
recovering...but those snapshots are fully portable to other
machines/architectures on the upside.

and I want to change the date to ISO format, '2004-08-04'. I tried with
emacs regex to change the slash to a hyphen but without success. And I don't

   Can SED be applied to this or is there a more elegant way to filter the

wes,

   Do you mean manually? I've 6,204 data rows in this file.

   Looks like a python script is called for to process all 6404 data rows
(and skip the header row).

Thanks, Paul,

I think sed is up to the task, here's one way to do it without busting out
a scripting language:

sed -e
's#\([[:digit:]]\{2\}\)/\([[:digit:]]\{2\}\)/\([[:digit:]]\{4\}\)#\3-\1-\2#'

It looks like a mouthful, but it's really quite simple; it just matches
AA/BB/CCCC and makes it CCCC-AA-BB. If you get false matches within other
columns, you could try anchoring against the comma that bounds the field.

heck no. I'd split out that column and then feed it to a bash script. then
recombine.

another thought has occurred to me... if this is a one-time deal, you may
be able to just load it into Calc. there might be an option under
right-click -> format cells to change the date format.

   Thanks, Scott. As I walked the dog just now (the other one's tight asleep
on the bed) it occurred to me that sed should be able to do the job. I'm
still a novice with sed and awk so I greatly appreciate the lesson!

wes,

   That's what I tried first. For a reason I haven't figured out, LO puts a
leading ' on that field and won't let me format the cells as
date/YYYY-MM-DD. I've done this with other data files but it just would not
work on this one.

Thanks,

Rich

Data -> "Text to Columns", after you've set the data type for an entire

Scott,

   I replaced OO.o with LO a while back. Regardless, I just tried your
suggestion and it's not working. The 'text to columns' removes the leading
single quote, then formatting the cells (after highlighting the entire
column) puts it back. Sigh.

Thanks,

Rich

To use emacs to turn the slashes into hyphens do 

    M-x replace-regexp \/ RET - RET

That will take care of the slashes.  Once you've got the hyphens taken
care of, you can use the regexp searches and the register commands to
swap the numbers around.

Hope this helps.

Swap the order. You first need to define the correct type of data for that
column (format cells), THEN "Text to Columns", which basically casts the
value, if possible.

Scott,

I'm still uncertain exactly what 'text to columns' means, but it did the

   This is interesting: IBM endorses SQL-Ledger (a F/OSS enterprise-level

Message-ID: <CAJeYwHfq4bmD8Vh1DhKv+0jqtbMY-zbO==ni4F_eqo6hHGh6Uw@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone know how to fix the problem of ntp erasing the old
loops.year-month-day files?  I am trying to save a whole year of loops
data in the /var/log/ntpstats folder area, but for some odd reason,
some process is erasing these files and only keeping the latest 7 or
so.

I can create a cron job, run daily, which will archive, but I reallly
would like to turn off whatever is doing this erasing.

Any ideas?  Has anyone else encountered this problem?

I am running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a 64 bit Intel Corei7 990x platform.

Thanks for the tip, Russell, I did look at the logrotate.conf file in
the /etc folder and saw the default values of rotating weekly and
keeping 4 weeks worth.  Unfortunately it looks like the ntp loop files
are only 1 weeks worth.  I furthermore made an entry inside the
logrotate.d folder trying to come up with something which might work
since there was no ntp entry there.

I suspect that the loop files will continue to disappear but this is
definitely an important hint.

Thanks!

TIP:

I found out what is going on in regard to ntpstat loopstat files
disappearing, on a Ubuntu system.  In the /etc/cron.daily folder, we
find a file titled "ntp".  It has been set up to keep only a week's
worth of data (setting = 7).

I changed this setting for under 3 years (setting = 1000).

This fixes the problem of disappearing ntpstat loop and peer files.

Subject: [PLUG] Firefox update broke tab settings
Message-ID: <20121216190232.646c66e5@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I had Firefox preferences set to always open links in a new tab and to
shift focus to the new tab, and it has been working fine for years. This
morning there was an update to Firefox 17.0.1 which broke this setting.
When I click on a link on a page it still opens the link in a new tab
and shifts the focus to the new tab, but it also opens the link in the
original tab, giving me two tabs with the same content. Then I have to
go back to the original tab and hit the back arrow to get the original
page to reload. This happens with all links on all web pages, even
Google search results pages. It's driving me mad.

I've searched everywhere in Preferences and I can't find any way to
change the behavior back to what it was. Unfortunately, the answer may
be there but I just can't find it. There are hundreds of settings and
the possible permutations are an unfathomably large number.

Has this happened to anyone else? Is there a solution?

However when using rsync to backup files, the rsync delete option is

How can this troublesome .gvfs folder be fixed, so that it does not

how hard would it be for you to hold down the CTRL key while clicking your
links?

I know it's sub-optimal but still better than clicking Back for every tab.
I have no idea on getting it to work the way you describe; I imagine it's a
bug that was introduced in this version which will likely be fixed in a
future version.

The .gvfs folder first appeared in Ubuntu several years ago. I know
that because I got hit with the same thing on my laptop, and I haven't
run Ubuntu on it for at least two years now.

In my case I was using rdiff-backup, rather than rsync. Eventually I
figured out that a fresh install of Ubuntu would recreate the .gvfs
folder, therefore there was no real need to back it up. I added it to
my excludes file, rdiff-backup ignores it, and the backup completes
without issue.

I also dimly recall that it was part of Gnome, not Ubuntu, but that
memory is sketchy.

Yeah, it's part of Gnome; it's in Fedora, too.  I exclude it from my
backups and all is well.

Thanks Dale and John for responding.

I was able to get rsync to bypass the .gvfs folder by using the
--exclude option, i.e. %rsync -avr --delete /home . --exclude "-
.gvfs/" but I should have been a bit more clear on what I found
strange.

When I assumed what I thought was superuser or root privileges, I
could still not change the permissions on the directory.  I even added
myself to the "fuse" group, but was still unable to change directory
permissions.

Does anyone know how to change the .gvfs directory permissions? (other
than boot up Knoppix and do it that way?)

When I first ran into this problem a couple years ago that was my first
attempt as well, but I failed. I recall asking on the Ubuntu forums
and, in spite of several replies, no one could come up with a way to
touch the file, not even as root. It did not occur to me to try a
Knoppix CD, but I know that I was amazed that the Gnome people had
figured out a way to lock .gvfs down so tight.

I'm still curious how they did it. And if we knew how they did it we
might be able figure out how to undo it.

Well actually it did just a little bit.  I was able to unmount the
.gvfs directory and change the permissions as "su".  But when I went
to remount it, the system complained that no such entry was found in
the /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab.  I suspect only on system reboot will
this directory get remounted again, and I suspect with the file
permissions reset back to the default value 500.

I guess for me the --exclude option is working just fine, as I did
watch several scores of files get deleted from my home area on the
backup disk which I knew were old files.

I can right-click and then select "open in new tab," if I remember to
do so. Ctrl-click doesn't seem to work, though.

And I just discovered another problem. When I click on a mailto link it
now opens a second instance of Claws-Mail and two compose windows. 

Did anyone test this release, or are we all the alpha testers?

I haven't noticed this problem. I'm on 17.0.1.

Couple of things to try:

* disable all plugins and see if the problem still exists

* try firefox reset:

John, I've tried to reproduce your failure here, and I can't.  I'm
running FF 17.0.1; normally I use Tab Mix Plus and Colorful Tabs,
but I disabled them for this test.

Left-clicking on a link opens that link in the current tab.
Right-clicking gives me a context menu with the options to open
the link in a new tab or a new window.  Middle-clicking opens the
link in a new tab, but retains focus in the original tab.
Control-left-clicking has the same result as middle-clicking.

On the other hand, clicking on a "mailto:" link did indeed open a
new instance of Claws-Mail.  (I tried it just now while composing
this reply.)  This seems reasonable to me, but I admit that I've 
never had much call to use "mailto:" links, so I don't know what
any previous behavior would have been.

Ennyhoo, the only thing I can think of is that there is something
odd set in your profile.  Try renaming your ~/.mozilla/firefox
directory to something else, and then see how Firefox behaves.

Sorry I couldn't be more help.

The previous behavior of clicking on a mailto link was to open a
Claws Mail compose window, assuming Claws Mail was already running,
which it always is on my computer. If Claws Mail was not running it
would launch it and then open a compose window. Now it opens a new
instance of Claws Mail and two compose windows.

I didn't even know you could run multiple instances of Claws Mail.

I checked the Preferences > Applications tab in Firefox and it still
says to use Claws-Mail; nothing has changed there. 

I tried launching Firefox in safe mode (with all plugins and add-ons
disabled), but the behavior remains the same.

I once had this exact same behavior from a bad mouse. It had a bad switch
and clicking on a link would open the link in a new tab and in the current
tab.

It is the "Gnome Virtual File System" - a pseudo-file system similar in 
concept to /proc or /sys (e.g. it looks like it's there, but it doesn't 
really exist on disk).  Wikipedia has a short article:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVFS

I gather that the code that supports this "file system" doesn't follow 
the standards for a working file system (presumably because Gnome didn't 
need those).  Consequently it doesn't really have files or permissions 
or owners.  That's why even root can't manipulate it.

Since it doesn't have real data in it, you can exclude it from your 
backups, like you do for /proc.  If you're a KDE user, you can uninstall 
a Gnome package to make it go away -- though which package varies from 
distro to distro.

There are two of us here.  Did it snow somewhere?  I saw a few flakes,
but never any sticking in NE Portland today.

I think PLUG got hit with the western Oregon snow fever. (AUGH a flake! It's a blizzard, I can't go anywhere.)

Yep. Had not returned around noon, I wouldn't have sent the cancellation.

There are a lot of things this could be.  You'll have to provide
more information.

*  Does the clock keep ticking over, or has it frozen?
*  I assume from your post that the mouse doesn't move.  Or can it?
*  Can you use <ctrl><alt>F3 to get a text VT?
*  Are there any errors in your system logs?
*  Try running a long Memtest on your ram.  (Give it at LEAST 24
   hours, preferably more.)
*  For that matter, have you cleaned out your computer case?  It's
   surprising what a load of dust can do.
*  Along those same lines, make sure all your cables are firmly
   seated.
*  You could have a corrupt kernel image.  Try booting a different
   kernel and see whether it freezes.
*  Is there a common set of circumstances for when this happens?
   E.g., are you running a particular (set of) program(s)?

If you do get into your computer case, be sure to observe static
safety precautions.  ESD (electrostatic discharge) damage can
cause all manner of weird, intermittent, "phase of the moon"-type
errors that are *very* hard to track down.

That's all I can think of off the top of my head.  Maybe someone
else can come up with more.

Hi

I have had the same problem.  About once every two weeks.

Total freeze.

Nothing works.

Have to hit the reset button..

No pattern that I can see.

Just upgraded to a new kernel.. Will see if that helps..

YMMV

I've seen this behavior when a drive is set to power down when idle. There are OS, BIOS and drive controller (on the drive) settings for this.

I had a long discussion/argument with Western Digital about a decade
ago.  Drives with TLER (a WD invention) are useless with hardware
RAID controllers because they will give up too soon and return an
error.  In my case I was successful in getting them to replace a pair
of TLER drives with equivalent non-TLER versions since at that time
their marketing fliers did not point out this limitation.

They do make "Enterprise" class drives that do not have TLER.

Here's what I have in my current RAID setup (LSI 9650SE-4LPML)

2 x WDC WD1500HLFS-01G6U1 (150G 10k RPM enterprise-class)
2 x Hitachi HDS723020BLA642 (2T 7200 RPM drives)

Before buying the Hitachis I emailed their tech support to confirm
that they did not do any error-recovery limitation.

Message-ID: <50D3AD64.90101@comcast.net>

I'm in the market for a DVD burner. I see that Amazon has a Lite-On for 
about $18. Does anyone have anything positive or negative to say about 
Lite-On? Are there other brands that are felt to be more reliable?

Thanks.

   The folks at ENU, Inc. have been very helpful when I ask about reliability
and quality among their products. They've not yet sold me anything
unsatisfactory.

Newegg ratings are pretty reliable. This ASUS is the highest rated there.

The Lite-On is rated a bit lower.

I've thrown away more than one Lite-on drive. You couldn't pay me to take one 
anymore. All of my recent builds use Asus drives, and I've been very happy with 
them. Fry's sells OEM-packaged Asus drives for $22. 

Of course, I don't burn as many DVDs these days as I used to....

Thanks John, and Bill, and Rich. Sounds like the Asus is the better 
choice. I'll probably order one tomorrow.

   I work with large (~16-20M) data files in emacs and when I do a global
search and replace a new buffer opens telling me that the number of changes
has filled the undo buffer. That's OK with me but I want to stop the warning
from appearing each time. How to do this is the last paragraph of the
warning:

 	"You can disable the popping up of this buffer by adding the entry

   I have many files for the .el scripts. Searching with grep in /usr/share
turns up nothing. How do I determine which one holds the `Warnings' library?

$ cd /usr/share/emacs
$ find . -name warning\* -print
./lisp/emacs-lisp/warnings.el.gz
./lisp/emacs-lisp/warnings.elc

That said, there's no need to be directly modifying the emacs source.
Use the Emacs Customization feature, go to  Emacs => Files = Large File
Warning Threshold  and change the value to something you're comfortable
with.

Dale,

   I did not know if it would be in /usr/share/ or /usr/local/share so I
tried grep.

   I just discovered another way of getting to the same result. In Top Level
Configuration is a section for Undo. Changing the Outer Limit from 10000000
to 20000000 will do the trick.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1212231250440.28318@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have a Belkin 900N wireless router and need a couple of pointers on
getting access to it so I can configure it to the LAN. I thought I had saved
information but cannot find it here.

   The cat6 cable is connected to a network port on the Belkin rather than
the WAN port because the other end is connected to the wired LAN router.

   The default IP address for the Belkin is 192.168.2.1. Because that's a
different net I need to temporarily attach that network to the LAN until I
can change the Belkin's static IP address. This is one thing I forgot how to
do.

   I think that once I get access to the Belkin I can change the IP address
and set up the admin name and password and the PSK.

   All recommendations and hints greatly appreciated.

Happy holidays all,

Rich

Hi Rich,

Go to this web site:

    <http://www.belkin.com/us/support-article?rnId=6939>

There you will find instructions on how to deal with all sorts of
Belkin routers.  They had info for my (very old) wireless unit,
and a couple of links to what looks to be yours.  (Basically, it
looks like just hooking your computer directly to your router and
using your browser to open <http://192.168.2.1> should do it.  But
you're best off checking yourself, just to be sure.)

This was one of the few times that Google has failed me.  Googling
for  Belkin 900N  gave me many pages of sites wanting to sell
things to me.  Googling for  "Belkin 900N"  gave me *one* site: a
FixMe troubleshooting site for Apple products.  Bad Google, bad,
bad.  No biscuit!

Anyway, I hope this helps.

Happy <insert-holiday-here> season!  :-)

HAH!  Much better than simply killing the warning message.  Now why

It appears that one of the reasons is that the router is an N900, not
900N.  Googling for that seems more productive.

The quickest way to handle the initialization process is to isolate the
router you are configuring. Don't connect it to the rest of the network
initially. Just run a cable from  a laptop to a lan port on the new router.
The router will get a DHCP address  on the routers network and you will be
able to log in and configure it. Then you can connect it to the rest of the
network.

The quickest way to handle the initialization process is to isolate the
router you are configuring. Don't connect it to the rest of the network
initially. Just run a cable from  a laptop to a lan port on the new router.
The router will get a DHCP address  on the routers network and you will be
able to log in and configure it. Then you can connect it to the rest of the
network.

   Thanks, Dale.

   This brings back a vague memory of having to use my laptop to initially
set up wireless routers because they could not be accessed via the LAN until
reconfigured. I'll do this ... and look at the above site, too.

   The manual, of course, is only for windoze and macs. After all, linux and
the *BSDs have only been around for 21 years so companies like Belkin are
not aware of these OSes.

Happy holidays to you, too,

Rich

   Ah, dyslectic fingers. I have the manual from the accompanying disk but
did not see useful information there since I don't run windoze or mac osx.

Is this typical Linus or is he just spitting mad and uncontrollably flew 
off into a rare rage?
It's usually considered a major management error to chew out a 
subordinate in public.  Maybe the maintainer deserved a keel-hauling, or 
even to be relieved of his responsibilities, but a leader doesn't just 
unload like that and publicly ruin somebody's reputation.

This seems to be in sharp contrast to the traditional advice given to
managers of people: praise in public, criticize in private.  Was it an
error that this appeared on a mailing list?

I am speaking as an outsider not knowing the organization nor the
organizational relationships here, so please enlighten me.

The LKML is _the_ means of communication among kernel developers.  All
info, all questions and all patches funnel through it.  And yes, it has
more than its share of flame wars.

Linus himself will readily speak his mind whenever he sees anyone doing
something stupid.  And changing the kernel to break innocent applications
in user-space is a sure-fire way to press his button.

I repeat that I do not know the organizational relationships.  Are
this guys paid or are they volunteers?  If they are paid, why not
silently fire a guy if he is as incompetent as Linus makes him out to
be?  Or is Linus exaggerating?

Denis,
   These guys are all volunteers.  Some may get paid for some of their
work, but by a third party who employs them to work on the code for their
own purposes.  Like chip companies paying people to ensure that Linux is
properly supported on their parts.  And I've not reviewed the code in
question, so I'll not speak to competence, but one of the Linux Kernel Devs
primary directives is "Don't break stuff in Userland that used to work!"
It's a good rule, and has served the community well.
            -Mike

> They are not paid.  Not by Linus at least.  Most get paid to write code
for the companies that employ them, and write linux code in their spare
time.  A few actually are paid to work on linux, by companies that see
value in supporting the OS.  They're the ones with really good reputations.

It's an interesting 'organization'.  Anyone can join it and anyone can
submit patches.  You gain cred by submitting good code.

Just looking at the responses on gmane.linux.kernel, none of the
respondents even flinched at Linus' tone. (Of course, it can be
difficult to see facial expressions on a public mailing list.)

I'm betting very much the latter.  We are not the calm cerebral
creatures we pretend to be.  We become enraged because of an
accumulation of upsets, rarely a single event.  The upsets are
usually multidomain, stuff coming in from all angles.  And when
we are enraged, we drop into tunnel vision, hypersensitivity,
complete abandonment of moral restraint or thoughts about
consequences.  It says something about Mr. Torvalds that he is
still able to type a coherent sentence in such circumstances.

The fact that he is still alive tells us that this is rare,
because he would surely be dead or in prison if this was a 
frequent problem for him.  I bet a bunch of other bad things
happened to him on the 23rd.  Car accident, airport delays,
plumbing failure, child tantrums, bad news from a doctor? 
I was on the east coast that day, what was going on here?

I've felt that killing rage once in my life.  I was very close
to picking up a chair and crushing someone's skull.  It took all
my discipline to just turn around and walk out the door.  I've
done that a few times since, when I got even close to that level
of anger.  Otherwise, I would be in prison instead of writing this.

 Linus is well known for being plain speaking and willing to share his
feelings. :-)

 Goggle for "Linus Torvalds flame war". There is a long history of
Linus calling out people and groups that he disagrees with.

In essence, the submitter was just "fired", at least as far as future patch
submission goes. Submitting bad patches, that also break things, is worse
than no submissions at all. (As others have noted, it's a meritocracy based

"Kernel by committee" is essentially how BSD is run. I feel that is the
primary, fundamental difference between the Linux world and the BSD world.
Linux is grown by a community; BSD is designed by a team. The community
contributes heavily to both.

I read the whole thread, and I see what you're saying. Kernel 
development does seem like something that should be tightly controlled 
and directed. Everything else depends on it. In that circle the true 
Linux mascot isn't a stoned penguin sitting contently on an iceberg; 
it's more like a Gray Wolf (one leader, coordinating a disciplined 
team,  and where each member's social standing depends on their 
intellectual strength.)

Outside of this forum, most of the Linux users that I've met don't know 
a lot about the kernel other than how to configure it. So I guess if 
military-like social coercion over an elite volunteer team is a 
management strategy that works, then great.  But the problem with a 
Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) is that there are no checks on what 
he wants to do and how he wants to run things.  And the problem with a 
team of volunteers (unlike a wolf pack) is if they don't like the BDFL 
and can't directly challenge him successfully, then they are free to go 
elsewhere. If the BDFL starts to lose it, or wants to retire or goes 
over the rainbow, what happens?

> ...The only way that seems to work is
> both VERY public praise for a job well done and EXTREMELY public ridicule

Team members will put up with this style of management only as long as 
they believe that the leader can walk on water and that the social value 
of being on the elite team remains high. These are strong forces. We 
know they can provide enough motivation to develop a passion in 
programmers that money alone can't buy, and we know it can work for some 
time, too. But will it work forever? Does this form of management create 
the sort of people who can lead a volunteer effort as big as Linux? Or 
are we depending on luck?

I gather from a couple of other sources that the style depicted in the
thread (as a whole) is normal on the kernel list, and has worked now for
over 20 years.

It's certainly not a style associated with corporate America, or local
dot-com startups. It certainly came as a surprise to me, even after
reading the Tannebaum-Torvalds debate (where Andy Tannebaum in '92 said
that "LINUX is obsolete"), ref
http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/appa.html
(I thought Linus would have mellowed with age.)

It suggests that people who want to "help" maintain the kernel need a
pretty thick skin. I suspect this "style" will continue as long as there
are many qualified developers ready to take their place in the kernel
elite.

Thanks,
Mike

The history of gcc is illustrative.

The 1997 egcs fork ran an end-around on gcc and became the main branch 
a couple years later. The mainline team had stalled, so it was 
demoted (so to speak).

Currently, LLVM and GCC are competing for mindshare, the former 
offering analytics not available in the latter.

I suspect that if Linus "goes over the rainbow," and Linux starts to 
become irrelevent, similar things will happen.

This reminds me of Michael Schwern's theory of Geek Communication.
Person-to-person communications are filtered.  Neurotypicals
("normal" people) have their filters on the output - say nothing
offensive.  Geeks have their filters on the input - hear nothing
offensive.  When neurotypicals listen to geeks, there are no 
filters and the neurotypical feels insulted.  When geeks listen
to neurotypicals, there are two filters and the geek detects
deviousness and insincerity. 

To non-kernel developers, Linus's style is extreme.  To a kernel
developer, it may be densely informative.  As both a beneficiary
and victim of kernel developers, I must say that Linus's "colorful"
language (protecting user space programs from nonstandard kernel
behavior) is more likely to result in a beneficial kernel for
ordinary users.  If only the writers of applications and user-
space libraries were equally concerned with reducing dependencies.

Message-ID: <CAArUT0jzvEKNypqR-rZMyDE5m7qvvNswkJyXtVnjo1TU_1f_7g@mail.gmail.com>

I have an Asus M3N78-VM MB with on-board sound only.  In trying to
debug overloading of signals using Audacity I found that the line
input produces a full undistorted signal at about 42mV RMS (~115 mV
P-P), and clipping at much above that.  These values are confirmed
with Fluke 87 and a Tek scope.  The clipping shows up in Audacity.
The web indicates that consumer audio line level signal should be 894
mV P-P, and my stereo receiver seems to agree that this value is the
correct order of magnitude.

My MB manual says nothing about what they think line-level is, and
Google did not enlighten me about this type of problem with the MB.  I
see no hardware switches on the MB nor anything in the BIOS.

Anybody have ideas?

Thanks,

I have no ideas, but I have an ASUS M2NPV-VM motherboard and I use its
onboard sound only. It sort of works.

Looking at the manual it offers the following support contact options:

Message-ID: <CAArUT0g855d=s8_SKWrA1=aYfzLUvSd8db1gomkgK_mPPoNXAw@mail.gmail.com>

I found that on AlsaMixer the Master was set to many +db.  Placing the
slide all the way down puts it at 0 db, where it should be.  I have
not re-measured the signal levels, but recording from my receiver is
now reasonable.

I found it confusing that the slider at the bottom is normal, when
slider at the top at the top is normal for other controls. And I do
not know why the mixer has the ability to jack up the gain so much,
but that is what it can do.

Thanks for reading.

Sounds like your input its set to mike instead of line.

That is what I thought, but it is not so.  Line and Mic are separate
input receptacles.
As I said in another message it was a mixer setting.

Is anyone using it? And if you know anything about it, could you be
persuaded to give a talk on it, and the Linux apps available for it?

I have to admit that the thought of dispensing with banks and
government currencies has appeal.

I've been meaning to research the crypto involved for a while.  If/when I
get around to it, I could put together a short talk describing it.
If someone else is already an expert, I'd love to hear an in-depth
talk on it too.

There is a group in seattle called Bitcoin labs.

They might be a useful place to connect to.

Let me know if an introduction would be useful...
