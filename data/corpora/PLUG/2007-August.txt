lol, We have the pinkish/purple-book-formerly-known-as-the-other-red- 
book. Nice. (One of my fav tomes over the years, the "Linux  
Administration Handbook (2nd Edition)", was formerly known as the  
"Unix Administration Handbook", with great X-ref for solaris  
oddities, IRIX gotchas, AIX amusements, etc... I loved that book back  
in 1999, it got me through *many* a scrape on some crufty DG/UX boxen.)

I believe I have some camels, llamas, and a few others (what was the  
DBI one, a cheetah?) I can contribute, as well as some SQL-92  
compatible texts. Maybe even some classic Oracle and PostgreSQL  
texts, I'll have to unpack these boxes labeled "books" from my last  
move.

Book fads are like programming fads... actually, they're like the  
tail-end of programming fads. New fad, tons of books, market gets  
saturated, lots of less-valuable words on paper, authors then get  
shafted for the "marketing costs" of giving away their books.

Publishing, yay!

I don't have many signed (hint hint) copies, but I do have some DNS/ 
BIND editions signed by some cricket dude....

So, where do I need to go to make my paper library more lightweight,  
again?

Subject: [PLUG] cleaning up RAM
Message-ID: <20070801150400.GA21743@gate.kl-ic.com>


I have a 1GB laptop.  At night I run dirvish/rsync for backups, and
rsync gobbles up all available memory.  Afterwards, the process
monitor in the gnome panel, and the command "free", shows most memory
allocated to buffers and cache (which is no longer used).  This may
not be a lethal problem, but it doesn't look tidy, and I suspect it
makes suspends take too long and perhaps even fail sometimes.

So I wrote a cheezy little application, "bigalloc", that clears out
memory of these unused buffers using lots of malloc() calls, below. 
"bigalloc" pushes all my running applications into swap, making them
a little slow the first time I access them afterwards, but the all
the stale old buffers/caches go away.

I'm going to set this up to run after rsync at night, and see if the
occasional suspend failures and gnome freezes are reduced.

"General Linux/UNIX discussion and help; civil and on-topic"

Perhaps PLUG-talk would be a better list for this conversation.

I apologize if this topic may be off-topic for this list, but I think  
it is relevant for us Linux users. I have been using Linux for the  
past decade (Ubuntu fan) and supporting a LAMP application for state  
public health departments (see www.healthreg.net). The federal  
government, and state government, public health agencies are not  
receptive to Linux or open-source software applications. Also,  
Microsoft is releasing fee development tools for us application  
developers that are nice and fairly easy to use. I have been trying  
to  get public health agencies to adopt open-source tools (i.e.,  
Linux) for the past decade with much frustration.

This list is not the appropriate venue for a conversation solely about a MS
Development tool and no it's not relevant to all of "us Linux users."
PLUG-talk or PLUG-devel are more appropriate lists.  The topic for this list
is:

"General Linux/UNIX discussion and help; civil and on-topic"

Please review the descriptions of the mailing lists:

http://www.pdxlinux.org/mail/

Perhaps I'm the only one who is bothered by off-topic conversations about MS
Development tools on a Portland Linux Users Group general list that is
supposed to be for:  "General Linux/UNIX discussion and help;."

I suspect this is not the case.

Are you commenting on just the last few entries in this thread, 

or have you followed the whole thing.

This topic did start out as a "General Linux/UNIX discussion and help;".

The initiating user wanted comments about how a LAMP system compared to
tools

available from Microsoft.

I am afraid that my "snarky" comments caused the thread to stray from the

original purpose, but I wholeheartedly feel that we should be able to debate

when and where and why a linux based system should or should not be used on
this list.

Really?  Sounds like the GOSCON folks have a bit more work to do.  Or 
maybe they just need to make more noise.

(Your Freudian-slip of a typo amuses me greatly.)

They also look the other way while their software gets pirated all over 
the developing world.  This 'free' set of toys is just a legalization 
of that ploy.  Come on, don't you know anything about how drug dealers 
operate?

With Linux, Apache, Perl, and Postgres, you have a license to install 
the tools on your development box, your production server, your staging 
server, your cluster of servers, your cluster of cluster of servers.

Before you get suckered into the 'free' tools, ask yourself what they'll 
cost you (and your clients) in the long run.

As for what's wrong with the Linux stack, that depends on your choice of 
linux stack.  Have you incorporated into your development process any 
of the comments from our discussion in May?

Though it may have strayed somewhat, I think this thread falls squarely
under the heading of "discussion", since the OP was arguably looking for
opinions of people who have used both VSE and the Linux based tools he's
familiar with. Trying to collect opinions from people who have a background
similar to his own.

Here, to satisfy the rule lawyer(s) in the house, hows is this for getting
back on topic: Since we've established that MS dev tools have a shallow
learning curve and are generally nice to work with, how can the Linux
community compete for mindshare amongst novice programmers? What is going on
in the Linux world that is competitive with Visual Studio? Anything? The
only thing I can think of that comes close is Eclipse. Is there anything
else?

I think that depends on where you are and who you talk to. I know of a lot
of healthcare and public education agencies that have Linux all over the
place. It's not often on the desktop, but the infrastructure is crawling
with Penguins. Slowly, they seep onto PC's as well. At my most recent K-12
school district, I ran the whole thing with Linux in the backend, with the
exception of two servers. One to host our anti-virus updates, and another to
host a reading application that required a Windows machine as an application
server. I even had 75 seats of Linux on the desktop in the for of two LTSP
installations. It's possible, even if it's not common.

Well put Eric. It's exactly that long term cost that I alluded to in Ken's
original thread, that pseudo-exponential curve theory I have applies to

kdevelop /maybe/

Does mono have an IDE?

For the "real hackers", it tends to be either vim or emacs.  I know, 
that frightens the newbies.

The thing is, unlike qdos, Linux has a good command-line.  It (and *nix 
in general) also has a long history of small, specialized tools.  The 
shell is the shell, the editor is the editor (except of course for 
emacs, which I hear is a great operating system.)

The other thing is, who's going to build it?  Those who have been around 
a while are typically happy with what they have and don't have an itch 
to scratch -- able, but not willing.  Those who want a beginner's IDE 
are willing, but (by definition) not able.

What about commercial options?  Well, the competition (MS) is giving 
their tools away for "free", so how to match that and make money?

Better tools are still being built, albeit slowly.  They still tend 
toward higher ease-of-use (power) at the expense of ease-of-learning 
(simple-ness) though.

Ubuntu sure has nice icons, doesn't it?

MonoDevelop: www.monodevelop.com

Last I tried it (~6 months back) it was ages behind #-Develop, the
Windows-only project it forked from, and it had many deficiencies I
couldn't deal with. (No support for gmcs, the c# v2. compiler, keys
strokes were hard-coded in the source, and their development team has
a policy of using 8-space tabs, to name a few.)

I think this is the core of it.  The unix philosophy doesn't apply
that well to integrated development environments.  This is also (IMHO)
why vim and emacs are so popular.  The editors don't actually *do*
that much, but they provide an infrastructure that can be used to tie
all these extremely "accurate" tools together.  You can run make from
emacs, and emacs understands gcc error syntax and ctags files, so you
can navigate with those. You can create a shell in a buffer and save
the output of an interactive session to *scratch* where a couple
regex's turn it into the test oracle you need to get to that bug
you're looking at in the GDB-mode window on the other desktop...

Vim provides similar capabilities, I'm sure, I just don't know them by
name, and window managers can accomplish many of these tasks too, if
configured to do so.

*Linux* is an integrated development environment with more
capabilities than any programming tool MS has ever pushed on their
customers.

Maybe we just need to make an environment configuration that is
targeted at development, and provide an easy way to use that in
concert with the non-programming UI people expect.

And there is the heart of the matter. Opening the eyes of novice developers
to this "fact", and the long-term cost benefits are key.

How do we get there from here?

- De-balkanize Linux by reducing the number of distros?
- Reducing the number of Desktop Environments?
- Adhering more closely to LSB?
- Create a good GUI IDE that has the strengths of VS by nicely tying all the
Linux pieces together?
  - Improve Glade/GTKbuilder? What about KDE?
  - Improve Kdevelop? What about Gnome?

It's a hard problem, and the only "real" solutions are sure to make someone
cry. For now, I think it's up to the individual to find an environment they
like and embrace it. In most cases this is determined by distro / DE choice.

What about web applications? If someone, like Ken, is looking to build web
apps, what sort of "studio" do we have on offer for them? Arguably this is
the battleground that the current generation of developers will be won or
lost. How do we get them? How does Pyro Desktop (
http://www.pyrodesktop.org/Main_Page) play into this?

Oh, man.  Off-topic AND cross-posted to a redundant list!  I am so going 
to get my charter revoked.

But I'm moving to New Orleans in five days!

Come to my huge blow-out going-away party this Friday night at Organics To
You!

Live music from my friend Morgan Grace and some other folks, beer from me 
and whatever you bring for yourself, a rockin' dance party and some other 
fun stuff.

Invite people and make this the second best party at Organics To You this 
summer!

Seriously, I expect to see every damned one of you there.  This is me 
leaving.  This is huge.

This forces me to wonder, is this going to cause SSL to be rolled out in
a *massive* way? The original point for using SSL was privacy, but the
cryptography also ensures integrity. Given how these things are almost
certainly leaching ad revenue from the source, I'm wondering if we will
see action get taken...

Then there is the temptation to write an RFC specifying that all future
protocols brought out mandate some form of cryptography...  (similar to
SPAMmers, they'll attack everything, this also allows things that
actually require privacy to hide better)

Message-ID: <20070802012959.GF9992@amethyst.spiritone.com>

I'm looking for an email service -- like yahoo or fastmail -- that provides
an SMTP server on port 80.  Authenticated is ok.  I'm willing to pay for
said service (on the order of, say, $20/year, which seems about the going
rate.)  Too many places block outgoing port 25 these days.

Anybody seen one of these -- or able to suggest a google query?

Thanks,

The only suggestion I have is running a proxy on a machine you control that
bounces incoming port 80 to the SMTP server you like. I don't know of any
services out there that offer this sort of thing...

*google for about 30 seconds*

Found one: http://luxsci.com/ (search term: email service smtp 80)

Looks like this might be useful too:

Message-ID: <20070801192427.4faab8b6.johnxj@comcast.net>

While at the Ubuntu booth at OSCON I acquired the business card of one
Christer Edwards, which says he is a mover and shaker in the Utah
Ubuntu Team.

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UtahTeam

While poking around in their website, I found links to a bunch of
Ubuntu artwork and other stuff, such as:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DIYMarketing?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=full.jpg

Which is a homemade stand to hold Ubuntu CDs. You print it on a US
letter size sheet and fold it according to the instructions, and there
you go! It occurred to me that I now have a color laser printer than
can print on 256 gsm stock, so I can produce a few of these in a nice
sturdy way. Other than Free Geek, can anyone think of places where
these could be on display? 

While thinking about that it also occurred to me that I can print the
cool Ubuntu CD jackets. All I need is a little glue and mine could look
identical to the real thing. However, I can't find the artwork for
Feisty. Ubuntu has the artwork for Dapper online, but if they put the
Feisty artwork on their site they did a good job of hiding it. Has
anyone ever seen it?

And on the same topic, my new computer has two LG DVD+-RW dual layer
drives that are also Lightscribe capable. If I could find the Feisty CD
label artwork, and if I could figure out how to get the Lightscribe
thingy working, I could make real Ubuntu CDs. Has anyone ever got
Lightscribe working on Linux?

I realize that we can get CDs free from Ubuntu. In fact I just ordered
30, since there were none available at Ubuntu Live. So the above is
just an exercise to learn how to do stuff and have fun. Nevertheless,
maybe I can produce something useful.

HAh! Great cut and paste.... (glad that wasn't one of the pr0n urls.... )

http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10803

Is what I meant to send. And I've actually used it. It works, though the
contrast doesn't seem as good as it does from the Win software...

There really are only 2.5 distros anyway: RPM-based, Debian-based and
everything else, like Gentoo.

It's a nice dream, but I don't think either Gnome or KDE is going away
soon. I've actually come to like Gnome in recent months. :)

Well ... KDevelop is great if you don't mind being locked into KDE, Qt
and Linux. I haven't tried the Gnome equivalent, nor have I tried GNUStep.

See above. But what about Eclipse and NetBeans?

It also depends on your "business model". If you're just in this for the
fun of it, that's one thing, but if you're looking to be *profitable*,
that's a whole different ball game. I've never used Visual Studio, but I
have worked with a few other IDEs and they all look and feel pretty much
the same to me. I finally bought Komodo because I do a lot of Ruby
development and almost no compiled language development. If you do
scripting languages, especially on Windows, you should check Komodo out.

Well, there's screem, quanta+, bluefish, nvu and a couple more I've
forgotten. I've never even heard of Pyro. But then, I don't develop web
apps.

Thanks, but I can't get it downloaded. Firefox pops up a window and
wants to know what media player to use for an RPM file. <Sigh>

Assuming I finally figure out how to download it, what distro are you
using it on? Is there a chance I can get it working on Feisty amd64?

Meantime, I shall search on Ubuntu forums.

Hm.  Lots of services use 587 for outgoing SMTP, or 465 for SMTP over TLS.

Message-ID: <46B1607F.5030006@gmail.com>

So I am running a copy of fedora in virtual box and I'm trying to build
a rpm.  I was getting a strange error that I finally traced down in how
the shell is matching

ls [A-Z]* on my debian machine give me my expected results, showing only
filenames that start with capital letters.

ls [A-Z]* on my fedora virtual box doesn't give me expected results, it
returns all files that start with capital or lower case letters.

The filesystem for the virtual box is logical volume ext3.

Is this another case where RH/Fedora is trying to help me, and instead
really pissing me off?  Suggestions?

I was asking Mark Shuttleworth about regression testing of Ubuntu,
especially on older hardware (like the stuff Free Geek reuses).
The response was a version of "better in the future".  Later, I
had dinner with Marc Tardif of Canonical Montreal - he is the guy
that actually coordinates hardware testing, and he had better info.

BTW, see if you can spot PLUG member Eric Harrison in this picture,
large-sized:

http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=874733804&context=set-72157600949584482&size=o

PLUG member Ted Kubaska appears - very out of focus - in two of the
pictures.  Local open source entrepreneur Brian Jamieson appears in one. 

At the beginning of Ubuntu Live, I knew about 6 of these people. 
At the end, about 30.  These are worthwhile events, people!

Possibly.  Check for differences in the LC_* environment variables 
between the two systems.  Check LANG as well.

If I had a drive that supported it, I'd use the instructions I found at:

I'm sure there are better reasons to do it, but I can't think of any...  ;)

I've focused on mostly gently transitioning things that started as  
"web-kludges" into "enterprise quality web apps" for, oh, the last 8  
years or so. I think I have a pretty good handle on this one.

Part of the underlying problem with making any IDE that's *really  
good* at developing powerful web apps is the very nature of the problem:
1. Logic is generally pushed into either a number of various  
scripting/cgi/framework layers (so, support both the languages *and*  
their current popular frameworks/templating systems/extendability  
libraries (CPAN, pear, pecl, rails, cake, etc. etc.))  *or* back into  
a database layer (so, support the various ways of doing that).
2. Presentation (the GUI) is so monumentally different on so many  
different devices that quickly being able to "see" a minor change is  
darned near impossible, and any "mini-render" needs to handle the  
idioms of, well, the vast bulk of devices (and if it's 508 compliant  
site, that list is... *cough* potentially extensive)..
3. The supporting technology stacks themselves vary wildy, as well  
(Apache/IIS/etc. versions, MySQL/PostgreSQL/bdb/LDAP/MSSQL/Oracle/ 
FoxPro/FilemakerPro/ODBC flavors, Linux/BSD/Win32/etc. families,  
sendmail/postfix/qmail/Exchange/mDaemon, and on, and on, and on.)
4. On top of this, there is a layer of business rules, such as  
versioning (CVS,SVN,Perforce, git), project management (Gantt  
charts,  responsibility tracking), documentation (in-line  
documentation, use-case diagrams, etc.), etc. etc. etc.

So, what did MS do well with their "studio"? They limited the scope  
of the problem by fundamentally *failing* to address the crazy angles  
of complexity, and instead, offered up limited templates and tools,  
limited language support, limited database support, limited client  
support, (etc.). It's *very* pretty, but not very capable. This is  
one of those bugs that is also a feature.

Comparatively, what does Linux and F/OSS do well? They have addressed  
the scope of the problem by not merely providing those tools, but  
providing them in great abundance, without any guidance ("studio")  
that places requirements and recommendations on how to use them. It's  
very capable, but *not* very pretty. This is one of those bugs that  
is also a feature.

To abuse the car metaphor, at the rental desk of the airport:
-MS gives you a Jaguar with a high end sound-system, leather seats,  
and per-passenger DVD players. However, you will be charged for  
additional passengers, exceeding speed limits, and you cannot drive  
on non-approved roads.
-Linux and F/OSS gives you a Jeep, an amphibious vehicle, a  
submarine, a jet-ski and an aircraft carrier,  a 747 and a Cirrus, a  
bicycle, roller blades, a unicycle, a skateboard, high altitude gear  
and scuba gear, a first aid kit and a Leatherman, a hunting knife and

that the tool can do.

Yay, Frontpage! (Feeding professional web designers and  
programmers.... since it was released.)

I guess my argument is that asking "how can we stifle the ability and  
creativity of developers (by constraining them to stable code), but  
give them pretty buttons to click", is not the problem.

Is the problem that young developers have been so constrained, for so  
long, that they really *don't know* how to write software without an  
IDE? Or perhaps that writing web software has become so complex that  
folks *have* to use IDE tools to manage it? Or what?

Freedesktop has done some good work in being sort-of the LSB for 
desktops.  I think it is finally gaining some foothold.

Now, will it go deeper into inter-app communication?

I would love to see something *like* dcop for all applications, but 
simply getting some deeper hooks into kwin/kicker would be nice for 
e.g. being able to programmatically raise/lower a (non-kde) window.

For example, this program would probably be a lot less ugly if gvim used 
dcop.  But then, it wouldn't exist if gvim didn't have client/server 
support.

  http://scratchcomputing.com/svn/misc/trunk/code/perl/bin/eedit

Admittedly, emacs does the IPC thing a bit more elegantly.  Now, if only 
it had an editor...

Of course, vim tends to be a bit cruftier in the windowing department 
(But, its programming language has a syntax (though really, it's the 
modality that I want (and viper just doesn't work for me (I never did 
take to lisp (despite the outward appearance of this sentence.)))))

>? - Improve Glade/GTKbuilder? What about KDE?
>? - Improve Kdevelop? What about Gnome?

See smalltalk.  See smalltalk run.  Run smalltalk, run!

The trick is simply to get it out of being stuck in that stupid box.  
Eclipse seems to have a similar problem from what I've seen.  Sockets 
and daemons, anyone?

It is a hard problem, but I think the real solution is to make money.

Maybe.  Catalyst, Jifty, and Rails still tend to stick to the console 
and assume some knowledge of SQL, sysadmin, etc.  I'm not sure that 
involving SQL is a good thing, but I'm guessing SQLite would have 
something to do with the out-of-the-box environment.

Likely, by the time anything appears, it will be totally outmoded as we 
move on to web 3.0.

Meanwhile, I just want better/cleaner glue and more access to the 
innards of various systems from userland.  If there is a "Linux way" to 
build an integrated system, I think that's probably it.

FAM+dcop = refresh konqueror when you save a file

  http://scratchcomputing.com/svn/misc/trunk/code/perl/bin/reloader2

FAM+rsync = transfer to another server when you save a file

  http://scratchcomputing.com/svn/fabsync/trunk/bin/fabsync

FAM+git = ???

And I'm still pondering what can be done with foot-pedals.

We might have touched on it a little in this thread, but aptitude and 
CPAN are really great reasons to use open source.  The ability to 
automatically resolve and satisfy complex chains of dependencies with 
zero procurement hassle means *writing less code*.  Better 
coordination, search, QA, automation, and other improvements will 
continue to add usefulness and power.

These also fail because the link is broken

There are several howto's on Ubtuntu forums, but they are six months old or longer, and all the links are broken for Feisty.

Using Dan Young's suggestion I got the files downloaded. However, Alien fails on them. 

I suspect that my problem is that I have amd64 Ubuntu, and all the instructions assume i386.

Interesting you should mention aptitude and CPAN. One of the things the
LSB working group finally got around to addressing is the plethora of
packaging/repository schemes, some good, some bad, few inter-operable
without massive effort, heavy automation, or both. Gentoo has a fairly
tight integration with Perl, Python and Ruby package repositories,
although it could be better, but they *don't* have any integration with
the R language repositories. Debian, on the other hand, has a good chunk
of the R language repository packaged, as a result of the efforts of a
single developer, Dirk Eddelbuettel. An "open source packaging standards
base" is sorely needed.

Some of both. As long as you're one person, working on your own projects
below a certain size, in a single language, you can probably do as well
or better with command line tools as you can with an IDE. But as soon as
you have multiple languages (like HTML, SQL, PHP and Apache config
files, for example) and multiple developers, you need ways for them to
communicate and organize things.

For example, I've never written a line of PHP but I'm pretty good at
Perl, so if I was working on such a project and a developer bailed and I
got handed his PHP code, the first thing I'd need is an IDE with a
debugger. Now, suppose they hire a new developer to replace the one that
left. I'm warm and happy in my pile of PHP and so *she* gets stuck with
managing the SQL.

Oh, and at her last job, *they* had IDE X, and *we* use IDE Y. Well
guess what? She will be told to learn IDE Y. In fact, most likely, one
of the points raised in her interview was that her resume showed five
years of IDE X and none in IDE Y, and that she would be expected to
learn the new one.

Developers have been constrained and always will be. And younger
generations have always had better tools than their predecessors.

Yes, I did finally get the links to work and I downloaded the RPMs.
However, alien fails on them. From past experience, alien always fails
on i386 RPMs because this computer is Feisty amd64. The last time this
happened someone with an i386 Debian system ran alien on the RPM file
and posted the resulting .deb to an Ubuntu forum. Then it worked with
--force-architecture. So if someone with a 32-bit system would do me
the favor of running alien on the RPMs and sending the .debs to me I
should be good to go.

Yep -- the MSA port (587/tcp) is the most standards-compliant way to 
go. Sendmail supports it out of the box, and I suspect Postfix et al. 
do so as well. Other than (some versions of) MS Outlook, all recent 
mail clients I've used support it as well.

Typically, MSA communications are assumed to be authenticated and 
encrypted. If encryption isn't present, at least the authentication 
method is assumed to be secure (e.g., CRAM-MD5).

The other bit is that MSA assumes communications with a mail client 
(which may be a bit flaky when it comes to SMTP behavior) rather than 
another mail server (which ought to know better). Mail queued via MSA 
should be double checked for correctness.

Part 1 ("Abstract") of RFC 2476 is an extremely well written and 
succinct argument for separating mail-transfer and mail-submission 
functionality. Part 1 ("Introduction") of RFC 4409 updates and expands 
that argument. Both are recommend reading:

  * http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2476.txt
  * http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4409.txt

Fedora (and many other distributions) alias various commands.

Run "alias" at a command prompt and it will show which commands are 
aliased to what.  I am not certain where they are getting set.

Yeah.  But our f*cking IT dept blocks all of these.

The feeling is it's easier to buy a forwarding service than to get
them to change.

Which ones, exactly.  What I got were
lightscribe-1.4.136.1-linux-2.6-intel.rpm
and 4L-1.0-r6.i586.rpm.  The 4L .deb is about 3.5MB, the lightscribe .deb is
about
500Kb.  Should I just email these to you at the comcast address?

It purportedly works with Postfix and Linux and has a large following.
The idea behind it is that you are joining an anti-spam community if
I understand correctly where you can report new spam so that everyone
can benefit.

Obviously, I am concerned about how these reports are vetted.  I'm also
concerned about what the Microsoft Gold Partner part is all about.

Pro is only $29, which seems reasonable.

I'm curious to know how this library will be structured?  That is, where
will the books be stored?

The idea (subject to further discussion and tinkering in the real
world) is that there will be no storage facility. The books will be in
the hands of PLUGGERs. If you want to borrow one you contact the person
who currently has it and arrange for transfer to you. The wiki that
Keith has in mind is how the contacting will occur.

I am sure there will be further commentary at the regular meeting
tonight.

Whoa! We're down to only Gnome and KDE now? This is one of the things
that I really hate about the Ubuntu movement.  (The other biggie is
that the division between UI and the rest of the computer's
capabilities is being blurred to oblivion.  In a few years you
probably wont be able to do *anything* useful w/out an xserver
running, unless you really dig into customizing your system.)

There are many, many fully functional, efficient and sexy desktop
environments / window managers out there, but their popularity is
declining because no one has made a *new distribution* that installs
one of them by default.  I don't know how many times I've heard some
one complain that they'd like to use KDE but the don't want to
reinstall their system with kubuntu.
</rant>

(if you haven't, do your self a favor this weekend and 'aptitude
install' some of these: enlightenment, fvwm, xfce, openbox, fluxbox,
blackbox, afterstep, Window Maker or IceWM.  The *box varieties have
even been ported to windows! After the install, logout and the new
options should be on the session list in the graphical login screen.)

   Well, we now know that the problem is the wireless drivers in this version
of ubuntu. Extensive testing with several different cards, deep diving into
what happens below the surface by an expert sysadmin isolates the problem
source. So, until the ubuntu folks get this fixed -- and it's an issue with
a number of cards -- we'll drop back to version 6.10.

   Nah. Even Ubuntu has an Xubuntu flavor running Xfce-4.4.

   I suspect, Rogan, that their popularity has not declined, but the buzz has
died down. There are still quite a few availalble and many have very active
development communities.

   A lot of users are overwhelmed with the available choices in linux. They
really don't have any solid technical basis for choosing among them, so they
stick with what's familiar or easy.

I should mention that I think the ubuntu movement *is* a Good Thing, I
just wish there were some differences about how it's been pulled off.
For instance:

  * emphasize the xubuntu-desktop, ubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-desktop
packages, *not* the different distributions.  This could very easily
be a choice on an "advanced" install page, if not a primary page.
Ubuntu is already the "default" by virtue of having a more
pronounceable name, so it's not really a step backwards in choice.
  * use power management tools that don't require an X server, or
somehow detach power management from the UI so your laptop goes to
sleep when you close the lid even if you switch to Enlightenment.
  * Ditto for networking tools.
  * Ditto for keymapping (adjust the underlying settings via some
gnome|kde|xfce UI, but don't delegate the keymapping to the UI
itsself.  I still want to be able to type when the UI changes.)

It would have been safer of me to say "relative popularity", but it is
true that I haven't even tried to measure this.

I'm not disputing this.  My point is that the perceived difficulty of
customizing an [x|k|]ubuntu install is much higher than the actual
difficulty, even for a novice.  (compare a complete
reinstall+reconfiguration, which may entail data loss, with a few
minutes of waiting on synaptic/apt).

Never mind, google appears to have misled me.  Not only does there
appear to be no Linux version, there is a claim that a worm exists 
which only propagates between Linux systems.  Ugh!  A worldwide
community built spam database makes sense only if EVERYONE can
participate.  That means not limiting people to Winhosed.

razor-check is similar in that its a distributed mechanism for checking
inbound email to see if its been caught as spam. I think, and I could be
wrong as its been awhile since I've looked at my MTA config but it
integrates or can integrate with Spam Assassin.

You're preaching to the converted -- I went through the "Oh crap KDE is
so bloated it makes me wanna hurl and Gnome just feels weird and is
almost as bloated" stage a year or so. I even wrote a couple of rants
about it on my blog.

I tried *all* the alternatives -- Enlightenment, IceWM, XFCE (4.2),
Windowmaker, Afterstep, FLWM, *box and even a couple of others that were
essentially mouse-free tiling xterm window managers. XFCE 4.2 was the
only "real desktop" among them, and XFCE 4.4 was about as bloated as
Gnome, so I ruled it out. I liked 4.2 though ... ran it for a while.

The conclusions I came to were:

1. If you *really* want a light desktop, "twm" isn't all that bad. Some
of the really light ones have a few more bells and whistles, but hey,
the X *apps* will run on "twm", and you can put them in the menu just
like any window manager, so why not just use "twm"?

2. Most of the other really light ones -- *box, IceWM, and the bizarre
ones -- were either too hard for me to use, not significantly better
than "twm", or had unreadable fonts.

3. That leaves the "big three": Enlightenment, Afterstep and
WindowMaker. I really like Enlightenment (with the Ganymede theme). It
just seemed a bit too edgy for me. Afterstep was just bizarre -- I never
did figure out how to do anything more complicated than open an X
terminal, and I wasn't crazy about the themes.

So I settled on WindowMaker. That's what I use on all my Linux boxes
now. I haven't gone whole hog and loaded the whole GNUStep development
environment yet. If there's a Gentoo GNUStep How-to out there somewhere,
I just might do that, however.

By the way, the last time I looked, WindowMaker was *way* out in front
of the window manager popularity contests. I don't see many updates go
by on Gentoo, so I don't know how its activity level compares with the
others.

We all are likely "speaking to the ____" when we talk about how the  
government agencies are not reaping the benefits from open-source  
software. However, I think the problem is not due to what the IT  
departments want; rather it is how the Human Resources (HR)  
departments recruit for the IT positions. The IT departments usually  
advertise requirements for skills with Microsoft tools (rather than  
open-source tools). Maybe this shoule be a part of the this next USA  
presidential campaign (e.g., how the federal government can reduce  
tax payers by using open-source software tools). Thoughts?

Bill,

Thank you for supporting my question on this list. I was only wanting  
to learn some web development (a.k.a. IDE tools) available for the  
Linux/LAMP platform that is similar to the the Microsoft Visual Web  
Developer IDE tool for use on the Microsoft platform. My intention  
was not to promote one tool/platform over another.

I describe myself as an "application developer". Put another way, I  
develop/crate software applications using existing tools (e.g., the  
tools being Ruby, Rails, VB, Perl, PHP, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Apache,  
IIS, SQL Server, etc.) depending upon my clients' requirements. What  
I am experiencing more of lately, is the client requiring a specific  
platform (i.e., Windows or LAMP); actually, most of my clients prefer  
Windows over LAMP.

If I sound like a frustrated "application developer", then I  
apologize, but I'm just sharing my experience in my "working world".

Subject: [PLUG] LPI Exams at FreeGeek
Message-ID: <1186115687.6252.47.camel@localhost>

Folks, 

Laurel at FreeGeek is looking to give the LPI exams at the FreeGeek
facilities Sun Aug 26. (Her email address is in the CC of this message.)

* Laurel needs to hear from you by Fri Aug 3 *
(sorry for the late notice)

This is all from my faulty memory, based on past exam discussion on the
FreeGeek LPI list (http://lists.freegeek.org/listinfo/lpi-study ), so
Laurel has the last word.

If I'm wrong about any of this, I apologize in advance to y'all and
Laurel.

When given by FreeGeek, the cost per exam is $40 (cash or check only)
It's possible to take two exams on Aug 26
LPI Level 1 (101 / 102) and Level 2 (201 / 202) exams are available 
   (I've heard that the LPI/Ubuntu 199 exam is also available)

The exams as given by FreeGeek are given by paper and pencil.

She wants to put in the order for the exam tomorrow (Fri Aug 3), as she
needs a three week lead time to receive them in time for Aug 26.

As I remember, she needs your LPI ID. If you don't already have an LPI
ID, register at http://www.lpi.org/en/lpi/english/candidate_area .

Thanks,
Mike

Is this a Perl script? If so, then do you call it via a CRON job/

My vote is that writing/developing/managing web applications/softare  
has become so complex that folks "have" to use an IDE tool to manage  
it. I have experience using CVS, and it breaks the code-base unless  
the application's code is segemented. However, open-source developers  
like to "code-share" which results in code breaking.

what do you mean by "breaks the code-base" in this context?  and how 
does CVS do that?

Subject: [PLUG] LPI Exams at FreeGeek

Folks, 

Laurel at FreeGeek is looking to give the LPI exams at the FreeGeek
facilities Sun Aug 26. (Her email address is in the CC of this message.)

* Laurel needs to hear from you by Fri Aug 3 * (sorry for the late notice)

This is all from my faulty memory, based on past exam discussion on the
FreeGeek LPI list (http://lists.freegeek.org/listinfo/lpi-study ), so Laurel
has the last word.

If I'm wrong about any of this, I apologize in advance to y'all and Laurel.

When given by FreeGeek, the cost per exam is $40 (cash or check only) It's
possible to take two exams on Aug 26 LPI Level 1 (101 / 102) and Level 2
(201 / 202) exams are available 
   (I've heard that the LPI/Ubuntu 199 exam is also available)

The exams as given by FreeGeek are given by paper and pencil.

She wants to put in the order for the exam tomorrow (Fri Aug 3), as she
needs a three week lead time to receive them in time for Aug 26.

As I remember, she needs your LPI ID. If you don't already have an LPI ID,
register at http://www.lpi.org/en/lpi/english/candidate_area .

Thanks,
Mike

   For those of you who administer e-commerce web systems: how is it possible
for a page to be encrypted with SSL and still display the open lock with red
slash on the address bar?

   I thought that all secured pages changed the background color of the
address bar to beige/yellow and the icon to a closed lock. But, I've come
across several sites -- all running on some Microsoft OS and applications --
that do not provide this security assurance.

   I see. So it's still secured, but shows no visible indication to those of
us outside their system, yes?

   Which suggests that the site was created as a paint-by-numbers effort
without real understanding of all the issues involved. When I received the
order acknowledgement e-mail from this company, it was in html and barely
readable because of all the table tags. Sigh.

Thanks, J.

Yahoo mail does something similar too.  The URL is http://, but a packet 
trace shows gibberish.  There is this one header.  I wonder if it has 
anything to do with the encryption mechanism?

Message-ID: <46B39022.9060505@gmail.com>

My small company recently moved our email to gmail.  It's pretty slick,
and works good.  This took a tremendous load off our server as it was
trying to filter spam, handle email, web pages and svn repositories.

This is all well and good, but we need to keep request tracker (our
ticketing system) working. 

It works with the /etc/aliases file, when email comes it it's processed
and put in the appropriate queue.

With gmail handling all our domain traffic, this broke.

My solution is to create a subdomain, rt.ourdomain.org and leave that
subdomain email server at our server.

So I created the subdomain

$ORIGIN   rt.ourdomain.org
             IN   A   10.10.10.10
mail      IN   A   10.10.10.10
             IN   MX   mail.rt.outdomain.org

and added it to our domain file.

I'm still not getting what I need though,

dig rt.ourdomain.org MX

returns nothing, but

dig mail.rt.ourdomain.org MX

returns mail.rt.ourdomain.org

I need to be able to route mail to

bugs at rt.ourdomain.org  

?!?

TIA,

Sean

I think you need an:

@       IN MX  <pref> mail.rt.ourdomain.org

(note the "@") or it is matching the previous "mail" line.  Or perhaps
this would work (untested):

  $ORIGIN rt.ourdomain.org 
       IN A 10.10.10.10 
       IN MX <pref> mail.rt.outdomain.org
  mail IN A 10.10.10.10
       IN MX <pref> mail.rt.outdomain.org

My bind book seems to say you need the "preference value" in an MX
record.

NX is a popular substitute for RDP in providing access to remote desktops. I have installed Ubuntu and freenx is thought not to work properly, so I have installed Nomachine's packages for the free version.

I'm using PXES (from the client) to access the Ubuntu server, but there seem to be authentication problems. Nomachine doesn't seem to have newsgroups, and its documentation is somewhat confusing, so I'm wondering where to look for help with a basic setup.

1. Are you using the free-as-in-beer NX Server or "freenx"? The
configuration files are in different places, and "freenx" is truly open
source and has higher limits on the number of sessions you can serve,
but otherwise, I've been successful with both servers.

2. There is not to my knowledge an open source NX client, so you'll have
to download one from NoMachine. If you're going that route, make sure
you get 3.0.x; the older clients (and servers) have some issues.

3. OK ... now you've got a server and a client installed. You need to
get a key from the server and insert it into the client using the
configure option. As I noted, the config files on the server are in
different places on the two "models" of server, and the keys are in one
of those files. I'm not sure where I found the documentation, but I can
tell you how my machines are set up. The server is the NoMachine 3.0.0
(on Gentoo Linux, it's net-misc/nxserver-freeedition-3.0.0-r2. The
config files are in /usr/NX, and the keys are in /usr/NX/etc/keys.

The client I'm using is net-misc/nxclient-3.0.0-r2. This is also on
Gentoo Linux, but the Windows client should be roughly the same version.
What you need to do is get the key from the server (file
'/usr/NX/etc/keys/node.localhost.id_dsa') and paste the whole thing into
the key dialog on the client. If this isn't right, authentication won't
happen. If you're still having authentication problems after that, post
another message.

I have *not* been able to get an NX client to connect to a Windows VNC
or RDP server. It's supposed to be able to do that, but I always use RDP
on Windows servers/desktops and use either "rdesktop" or "krdc" as a
Linux client.

I'll report when I have things working.

Specifically what I do have working is:

1. nxserver-freeedition 3.0.0-x on Gentoo with nxclient on either Gentoo
or Windows
2. freenx server on CentOS 5 (it's part of the distro) with nxclient on
either Gentoo or Windows.

Incidentally, the keys on the freenx server on CentOS 5 are in
/etc/nxserver -- the one you want to install in your client is
/etc/nxserver/client.id_dsa.key.

Just took a look. LaCie's website is misconfigured and sending the wrong 
MIME-Type for .rpm. Just save the file and use the usual tools to operate on 
it, firefox is doing as it's told by the remote server.

Subject: [PLUG] Setting up razor...
Message-ID: <1186256076.25120.10.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Does razor have to be installed on a mailhub?  I want to 
integrate it on my postfix relay with spamassassin, but it
talks about registering users which I don't have actual 
accounts for on  my relays.

I have a file list via diff when I installed it.  I assume 
that I just delete the new files.  Unless there is a better
way to uninstall perl modules...

I have a hunch that I only need razor-check working on my 
relays and that razor-report and razor-revoke need to work
on the mailhub where all the mailboxes physically reside.  
The install instructions are somewhat confusing.  It's 
especially confusing when DCC and other acronyms are thrown
in by various HOWTOs on the subject.

Are you running in a frame?  if so, do you have a "blank" source for part of
the frame?

I have seen this happen when some part of the page is referenced to a

Bill,

   I do have frames in firefox-2.0.x. Whether the site uses them, I don't
know. The site is www.knoxfoam.com, and it uses html-4.01 transitional with
CSS and javascript.

> I have seen this happen when some part of the page is referenced to a

   It is on the checkout pages that I saw the white background and open lock
with a red slash through it, rather than the yellow background and closed
lock that overtly indicates a secure site.

   When I wrote to the company one of them replied that the site _is_ secured
with SSL and it worked fine for him when he looked at it. Shrug.

Thanks,

Rich

Bill,

   That's very interesting. There are a couple of other sites (e.g.,
www.photoformulary.com) that have also never displayed the overt signs of
active SSL security ... for me. This with several versions of firefox and
opera.

   Wonder why.

My steps (not including my mis-steps).  BTW I did this on LinuxMint
xfce version.
1. Add the repository for freenx. Notes on that are
here:https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX
2.  Don't move the sshd port like it is documented in the above url.
3.  run "nxsetup --setup-nomachine-key"  No need to run nxserver
--add-user as the normal
     client config uses a ssh tunnel.
4.  Install the nomachine nx V3.0 client.
5.  On the client use custom and run "/usr/bin/xfce4-session" for the command.
6. Run the client and connect.

BTW the nxsetup could give you errors/warnings depending on which other packages
you have or have not installed.

Can any recommend some good web sites to send an inquisitive middle

marble you throw in the car travels only as fast as you throw it, or
does the speed of the car have any effect. He asked my sister, so I have
until next Sunday to refine my answer, and come up with other resources

BTW, I know that the answer includes the speed of the car. I'm just

I don't know about web sites, but I'll bet you if you go down to
Powell's and pick up a Schaum's College Outline for freshman physics,
your middle schooler could not only read it and figure out the answer to
the question, but probably get a job teaching middle school science. :)

Seriously, though, some times the old ways really *are* the best.

Like all the laws of physics, it is not obviously true that the marble
includes the speed of the car. For instance, it might depend on which
direction the car is going, or how fast the car is going or who knows
what.  For low car speeds it is has been experimentally confirmed  to
be true that the marble does include the speed of the car  and does
not depend on direction or speed.

While it is approximately true for marbles thrown in cars, it is not
generally true. If the car is going near the speed of light, and the
marble inside the car is thrown near the speed of light, then an
observer fixed on the ground will not see the marble in the car going
at twice the speed of light but will see a marble going under the
speed of light. These corrections are embodied in the special theory
of relativity.

I don't know about middle school explanations, but you might like this one
http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8112.html

Not pertaining directly to marbles thrown in cars, but there are  some
very nice demonstrations of modern physics here
http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/index.pl
that could be understood by a middle schooler

Are you sure this is a Fedora 7 box?  There is no "extras" repository after
Fedora Core 6.

John,

The box is a Fedora Core 6 --> Fedora 7 upgraded box.
The edit worked.
Thanks.

All the 64-bit, dual-core, virtualization fanfare has me thinking that
this summer might be a good time to upgrade my trusty old P3 desktop
system.

Anyone have recommendations for reasonably-priced Core Duo or Athlon
X2 motherboard/CPU combos that are reliable Linux hosts? I'd like to
keep the total cost near the $200 mark.

As einstein explains it's all relative....

To someone in the car, the marble is traveling the same speed as it
would if you were standing still.

To someone standing still it's traveling faster than the car.

A more interesting question is if you are in a car that's traveling near
the speed of light, and you turned on a flashlight, how fast would the
light travel....

That you can google.....

Well, I'm very happy with the box I had built at CompUSA, but it was a
good bit more expensive. I ended up with a Gigabyte S3 motherboard and
an Athlon64 X2 4200+ processor (and 4 GB of RAM). You can probably get
something for less, but I'm not sure you could get it for $200.

I basically only buy a new machine when one dies or I can't stand the
thought of touching such ancient technology. In this case, I had a
perfectly good P3, which only had two things wrong with it -- the sound
card burned out and it would only take 512 MB of RAM. The sound card is
no big deal, but 512 MB of RAM is pretty much useless these days.

Distro? Unless you're a Debian-hater, that's what I'd recommend. CentOS
and Fedora 6 and Fedora 7 all seemed solid enough in my initial testing,
and of course I run Gentoo on it now, but I think Debian is exactly the
right combination of stability and "freedom" for a 64-bit box.

Thanks for the reminder about near the speed of light. I forgot that the
two obey the same law of physics -- different paragraph, perhaps.

Actually, a Gigabyte S3 motherboard (there seem to be more than one)
and an Athlon 64 X2 4200+ from Newegg totals ~$160 currently, so
that's right on the mark. I'll add it to my list of known-good
motherboard/CPU combinations.

There's really nothing wrong with my old P3, but I've been eager to
play around with virtualization for a while now, and any desktop
upgrade is cheaper than a new laptop.

64-bit Linux doesn't suffer from various odd "quirks" anymore? Other
than not being able to run Flash (indeed, a tremendous hardship)...

That depends on how define "quirks". On a server, it's a no-brainer, 64-bit
all the way. On a desktop,  you will likely run into issues, most of them
surrounding multi-media and games. If those aren't issues for you, then
64-bit makes sense. For my use case, 64 bitness buys me very little (I don't
have 4GB+ RAM, and I don't do math that is that hard) and increases the
complexity of the things I like to do with my desktop (games, multimedia,
etc) substantially, so I stick with 32-bit, even on my X2 4400+. My
housemate, on the other hand, runs 64-bit and has had the time and
inclination to setup a variety of hacks to get basically the same
functionality I have, so it is possible. It just requires more work than I'm
willing to do.

I recently built myself a new desktop using an Abit motherboard and an
AMD Athlon 64 X2 4600 CPU with fan, and an Abit motherboard. The Abit
motherboard was (to use Drew's term) "evil." There was a long thread on
it here where everyone was trying to help me get the SATA controller to
work with mdadm (trying to create a RAID-1 array). The whole thread was
futile because it turns out it was a buggy BIOS/SATA-controller
combination that no amount of tweaking Linux could ever fix. At the end
of Fry's 90-day return policy time period I returned it and replaced it
with an Asus M2NPV-VM that has been beautiful. The M2NPV-VM has four
slots for RAM (up to 8 GB), four SATA II connectors, nVidia GeForce
6150, nVidia gigabit ethernet, firewire, and e-SATA connector. I tried
Fedora 7 and Ubuntu Feisty (both 64-bit) and everything just worked.

I think I paid $126 for the CPU, but that was several months ago. Today
frys.com lists the 4800 for $119 and the 4400 for $99. The motherboard
was $84.99, and worth every penny. Of course, you might be able to beat
those prices online. If I wanted to save money I'd cut back on the CPU
because I don't think the difference between 4400 - 4600 - 4800 is
noticeable. My system screams, but I think it's mostly due to the SATA
II drives, more than the CPU.

Huh.  Are they control-freaks, or what?

I did some looking around, and found that lots of folks use hotwayd or
Blue httpMailProxy on the client side to interface to httpmail providers
like Hotmail, Lycos, Spray and MSN.  

Also, one can get out via a proxy on port 80.

The issue with flash and other browser plugins is a non-issue. While
most distros include the 64-bit compiled Firefox, you can also just
grab the 32-bit version and run that, while being able to install your
standard plugins to your hearts' content.  I actually find the 32-bit
Firefox is frequently more responsive than the 64-bit as well.

Doesn't that require a 32-bit chroot?

Nope, as long as you have the standard 32-bit compat libraries
installed in /lib, which is default for most distros.  You can tweak
the packages and not install them, and some package groups for some
distros may _not_ have them included... but an "everything" or
desktop/workstation build should.

Different distributions handle this problem in different ways. I 
believe the Debian/Ubuntu answer is a 32-bit chroot environment, while 
Red Hat and derivatives install 32-bit and 64-bit libraries in 
/usr/lib and /usr/lib64.

It depends on the distribution.  Fedora, for example, allows
installing many 32-bit and 64-bit packages simultaneously including
all of the libraries.  This means it is possible to install
firefox.i386 and firefox.x86_64.  There is even a package in the
newest version, firefox-32, which switches /usr/bin/firefox to the
32-bit version.

Excellent! A picture is worth a thousand words, especially when those
words are in Japanese! But, it does demonstrate that the speed of the
truck is added to the speed of the object thrown. In this case
subtracted, since the baseball is shot backwards relative to the
direction of travel of the truck.

Thanks!

[1] Slashmail uses port 25 by default, but can also use 225.  From the
[2] FAQ:

        Do you support SMTP relaying through a non-standard port? My ISP
        is blocking outbound port TCP 25
        Yes! You can alternatively use TCP 225 when configuring SMTP
        relay settings.

It's $18.95/year and uses all [3] OSS, which is why I went with them.
No complaints.

Once I discovered that the tech who built the box was mistaken when he
said it would function with a single RAM stick, everything else just
fell into place. I don't know how many generations of the major
community distros have under their belt on AMD 64, but CentOS 5/RHEL 5
and Debian Etch are solid and appear to be quirk-free on my system. But
that's just boring -- gimme the 2.6.22 kernel, gcc 4.2 -- no, wait on
that compiler, it's got some issues -- and some nice number crunching to
fill up my (now-paired) 4 GB of RAM. :) Quirks? What quirks?

I have run 64 bit on my laptop  which is a Turion64 X2 and also on my dual
core Xeon server both with no major issues other then a kernel/bios conflict
on the laptop which strangely enough only showed up with the 32 bit but not
64 bit installs.

My only suggestion from a hardware perspective is that if you want eye candy
to go along with a screaming system then go for onboard nvidia if you're not
into games or whatever the cream d'jour is as far as PCIE or whatever is out
ther now if you are into games as the nvidia bits support AIGLX natively ..
and ATI hasn't gotten there yet.

Yeah ... NVidia is the way to go. I'm not sure about the other distros,
but Gentoo supports the proprietary drivers. The NVidia logo when X
starts is too cool not to have. ;)

My guess is that his IT dept. blocks all outgoing ports except port 80 (and
maybe 443), so running on port 225, 587, 465, etc. aren't going to help.
And if his IT dept. is that controlling, I wouldn't be surprised if port 80
is redirected to a transparent proxy anyway, which means SMTP traffic isn't
going to get through even if it is on port 80.  If it's a low volume of
traffic, you may want to look at something like "httptunnel" to mask smtp
traffic as http traffic and then proxy it through your home machine or some
such.

Message-ID: <46B8D3ED.3080101@comcast.net>

My small desk is crowded with keyboard/monitor for my home Linux system, 
and the work wind-duhs laptop. I use tightvnc at work to connect to some 
remote systems. It occurred to me that I could gain some space on my 
consensus reality desktop, by moving the laptop elsewhere, and 
connecting to it via vnc. Easy enough to set up the vnc server on the

I don't know which distro you are using, but under Debian here are the
packages I am using
dpkg --get-selections | grep vnc
libsvncpp0c2a                                   install
vnc-common                                      install
xvncviewer                                      install

There is also a
xtightvncviewer - virtual network computing client software for X
which I am not using, but which might work for you.

What didn't work about openvnc?

Bill Barry

This works fine for accessing vnc on a windows box.

You could also replace nspluginviewer with a static 32bit version and run

Don't know if this is useful to you, but we put directions on our ecf wiki about how to connect to our server at OSU (decribes what we did for vnc). Our server runs Suse and we downloaded a vncserver from YaST. I typically connect form Ubuntu and downloaded a vncviewer from the Synaptic Package Manager. Works fine.

After much finagling I got my Lightscribe drives working in Feisty
amd64, in spite of the fact that the proprietary software is 32-bit
only. Then I burned a great Ubuntu disk image that I found online. And
the output of the beautiful full color image is black and white
(grayscale) only. After googling, that's the way Lighscribe is,
regardless of platform.

So Lighscribe sux. Save your money.

You can also run all the plugins in 64-bit Firefox on 64-bit Linux. You
just have to haunt the Ubuntu 64-bit forum to figure out how.

At one time I had flash working in 64-bit Firefox under Feisty. In the
process it also worked in Opera,, which is only 32-bit. Later I
discovered that flash is mostly a pain in the butt. So I deleted it
from Firefox, but left it running in Opera. Now I have the best of both
worlds. If I want to view youtube or some site where I really must have
flash, I use Opera. Firefox is my main browser and if a site uses
flash, it just doesn't work, so I remain unannoyed.

Linux in 64-bit rox.

How is the quality? Did you need to invert the cd/dvd to do it?

Yes, you must have a Lightscribe enabled drive, and the media must be
Lightscribe enabled. To burn the image you take the CD/DVD and place it
in the drive upside down. 

You can burn the data on the CD/DVD before or after burning the image.

It works beautifullt, except that the output is grayscale.

I've not heard of an inkjet that can print directly on the CDs.
However, I have had some bad luck with the CD labels you can buy,
which you are supposed to print on (with an inkjet, using a standard
template and your favorite office app) and then use a cheap plastic
applicator to stick on the CD.  I can never get them to line up right,
and you end up with an off balanced CD, or perhaps a couple of bubbles
on the CD that get caught in whatever drive you stick them in.

So after that, Lightscribe doesn't sound too bad, even grayscale.

Uh, yes.  Suitable only for those occasional B&W images with no edge
bleed, like text labels for one-off customer disks where it is 
essential to match the label with the data.  The Lightscribes are
way oversold, and useful only for a narrow range of non-consumer
applications.  Question:  now that you have some, what happens
when you subject the label to bright sunlight?  Heat?  Water?

Personally, I prefer to draw byutifl(2) labels on sticky label paper
on the color laser printer (another story:  I have an HP2605DTN,
which must be instructed through CUPS to use label paper settings,
so that the labels run extra slow to properly fuse the toner).

I remember writing info on a CD with a Sharpie, then allowing
insufficient time for it to dry before reading it at 50x.  Nice ink
splatter off the edges of the CD - and into interesting parts of
the drive, no doubt.

The problem with ANYTHING on a CD - Sharpie, inkjet ink, sticky
labels - is that the ink or the adhesive can bleed through and
affect the data layer (which is under a thin coating on the opaque
side).  Of these, I trust sticky labels (from a reputable source)
the most;  the inks are not designed with a CD in mind, and may be
corrosive or have chemical components that diffuse through the
coating.  Perhaps the writable-surface CDs are better armored.  In
any case, it seems safer to write on a label, then attach it gently
to the CD, rather than subject the whole CD to the tender mercies
of a printer's paper handling path.  Given what printers sometimes
do to paper, I shudder to think of what they might do to a fragile
optical quality CD surface ...

I'm getting out of this barbaric time period as soon as I find a new
flux capacitor for my busted time machine ...

Yea inkjet printers that can print directly on printable CD/DVD media have
been around for a little while now.  Epson has a few, not sure about other
brands.
I have an Epson RX580, and have done a couple CDs on it already (Fedora 7
being one), it works quite well.  No messing around with the label
applicator things etc.

Basically the printer comes with a special tray that holds the CD (has an
indent and a pop up piece in the middle that holds the disk) while the
printer pulls in the tray and does it's thing.
The printable media is not much more than regular, and i think less than
Lightscribe media.

Printable media basically just has a sorta thick plain white coating on top,
instead of the usual silver with black lines to write on with sharpies.

So: no off-balance or bubbly labels, and its color not just greyscale.

Epson Stylus Photo 220. Has the tray described in Matt's reply. I
haven't tried it with Linux, but it works as advertised in Winders.

Several years ago (maybe 10) I bought a CD Stomper at Fry's. It's a
heavy plastic base with a pop-up spindle. The spindle has two diameters.
 The diameter of the lower part is the size of the hole in the label.
About an inch up the diameter reduces to the size of the hole in the
CD/DVD. You put the label over the spindle, sticky side up, and move it
down to the base. Then you put the CD/DVD on the spindle, data side up,
so that it rests on the top of the larger diameter part of the spindle.
Then, push that down until it meets the label. Take it off the spindle,
flip it over and work any bubbles out. I've never had trouble with it.

I was on kubuntu at the time. I also am running SimplyMepis on a 
different partition. Normally I run on stable version of somthing, and 
play with something more leading edge in the other. Right now, both 
linux's are beta releases, and I have munged something or another in 
both. I am going to wipe out kubutu and install Lenny for my more stable 
release and try not to muck with it too much.

I got it working here on the mepis distro. I used your dpkg output as a 
guide. I apt-got libsvncpp0c2a, vnc-common, and xtightvncviewer. Ran the 
viewer, and it worked.

  Thanks,
             Mel

It was probably too secure. :-)

I kept getting "Connection refused". I tried messing with ports, 
specifying the display, and such. Then there was the key, which was not 
required from the server, that led me to think it wasn't compatible.  I

Agreed; I use the Stomper also, and have applied well over 3000 labels
over the past few years (remember all those Knoppix disks I used to 
pass out?).  Jason may have been using a different brand of label and
applicator.  I have never had any misalignment problems.  About three
times the label tore as it came off the page, and about 6 times I put
it on the wrong side :-).  The printer does far more damage to the
label sheets (jams, fuser problems) than the application process does.

Regards the problems I mentioned in a previous posting, about chemicals
from the adhesive affecting the data surface - I have not seen any
problems, but one of my Knoppix victims :-) may have.  Google for 
rants about label damage for different experiences.

you can also get inkjet printers that will print directly to the surface 
of the disc.  (Epson makes at least one model for under $90.)  You need 
"inkjet printable media", but that is pretty easy to find.

There is also a difference between CD media and DVD media.  With most cd 
media, you can scratch off the foil from the top.  (Turn a disc over than 
scrape it on a sidewalk and see what happens.) DVDs have a layer of 
plastic over the foil.

The problem is probably USB suspend, which was added to kernel ... err,
I forgot, but before 2.6.20. My Canon scanner worked perfectly until I
upgraded from Edgy to Feisty.

Some report that scanbuttond will fix it. It does for me, but
scanbuttond tends to send my computer into some kind of endless loop
with the CPU at max until the whole thing chokes on itself. If you have
to do a lot of scanning, I would recommend just moving back to an
earlier kernel.

There are a lot of posts about this on the Ubuntu forums. Supposedly it
will be fixed in Gutsy. Meantime, what I do is just boot to a Knoppix
5.0 CD (not 5.1, the kernel is too new), mount my regular partitions,
do my scanning, then reboot. Luckily I don't need to scan very often.

I assume that this is all I need to add to my spamassassin-3.1.8
local.cf file to invoke razor2:

use_razor2 1
razor_config /etc/mail/razor-glob/.razor/razor-agent.conf
razor_timeout 10

Now, spamassassin is running as user spamfilter and razor-glob is another
user account set up under /etc/mail.  Can I use 2 different users and have
this work right, or does razor need to be in a spamfilter owned directory?

Razor uses a remote database, right?

Does razor show up in the mail log?  How do I test razor?  The instructions
for integrating razor with postfix are abysmal.

Okay,

I was under the impression that Novell was the "bad guy" since they took 
SUSE from FOSS to a licensed product.  I got this impression from 
someone else's opinion of Novell.

Please give me the "Reader's Digest Condensed Version" (RDCV) of what 
the celebration is about.  I admit ignorance and throw myself at the 
feet of the group's collective wisdom.  I should state for the record 
that I don't need an excuse to quaff a well bred dark and slightly sweet

Perhaps someone else can sum it up better, but here is my shot:

First there are a couple different things going on, the SCO vs. Novell court
case, which has been going on for a LONG time, and the Novell & M$ patent
deal.
Completely separate issues.

As for the case, Novell is now confirmed to be the inheritor of the original
UNIX copyrights, not SCO.  This means that all the claims that SCO was
making about them owning IP (intellectual property, namely code) that was
stolen and put into Linux, have fallen to dust.  This means that the other
major case, SCO vs. IBM, should be over much quicker (relatively), as well
as any other SCO cases hanging out there (SCO vs. RedHat I think...?).

The Novell and M$ patent protection deal, which many have called a bit of
extortion, is a whole separate issue.
Also, SuSE is still FOSS.  They sell it just like SuSE did on it's own
before Novell bought them, with support contracts, and Non-FOSS software
along with FOSS software,
and they have the "community" free edition, with only FOSS software,
OpenSuSE.

Many people in the FOSS community did not like what Novell did in this M$
patent deal, but many others saw it as a "necessary evil" in order to
continue in the corporate world with SuSE being able to inter-operate well
with M$, and not having to worry about potential patent lawsuits from M$.
Along that vein, many still doubt the validity of these claims from M$ (they
have not disclosed exactly what these alleged patents are that Linux
allegedly infringes on), but for Novell you could say it was a CYA
maneuver.  Some other Linux vendors have jumped on the bandwagon to make
deals with M$, such as Linspire, Xandros.  But some of the bigger ones
refuse to, such as RedHat and Ubuntu (and Debian obviously, though they are
not themselves a commercial distributor).

So as far as the whole situation of Linux being potentially "tainted" with
stolen code from SCO, that has been blasted to bits.  For this Novell is
definitely to be thanked.
As for the M$ deal, a lot of people will still be weary.  Perhaps in some
ways, this case finally being won will redeem Novell.

This whole potential legal cloud over Linux had a dampening effect on its
adoption- though happily it did not completely stop it as no doubt SCO (and
M$) had hoped.
Now that the cloud is lifted, more people will be less afraid of adopting
Linux.

However the case is not completely over- but the main big hurdle is
crossed.

Thank you for the response.
I read the Wikipedia article about SCOgroup's history and lawsuits.  I

Is there a better Linux option than this from Dell?  I looked at the the 1720,
it appears to be Vista only though.  Biggest concern is screen size  
for drafting.
Linux desired, it just works.  This is a work laptop to replace a flaky iBook.

I completely agree about the display on the 1420. Also, it comes with
32-bit Ubuntu, although you can run anything you want on it, really.
Other than the display I really like the options - even up to 160 GB
7200 RPM hard disk. The price is reasonable, too.

At OSCON I attended a session given by a Dell representative
specifically discussing the new Dell + Ubuntu offerings. The important
fact he told us was that Michael Dell (after looking at the 147,000
pro-Linux responses he got from IdeaStorm) gave his employees 45 days
to deliver at least one notebook and one desktop with Linux. They just
didn't have time to get more than the 1420 with 32-bit Ubuntu ready. He
assured us that 64-bit Linux and more models will be forthcoming. He
also said that part of the problem is that they want the Linux
computers to be completely open source, including drivers. That means
that they may need to modify components in other models, or write the
drivers themselves. Nevertheless, I got the definite impression that
additional announcements could come at any time.

I also got to see a 1420 at the Dell booth at OSCON. Nice computer, but

And the short version is just "lesser of two evils."  SCO had adopted 
the business model of suing over alleged copyright issues, while Novell 
has recently adopted the business model of frightening their customers 
with the threat of frivolous "alleged patent" lawsuits.

On the surface, I would say the latter is more evil, except that SCO was 
alleging that Linux contained "their" UNIX code (though I suppose not 
in this case.)

I'm somewhat dissappointed that the ruling does not mention the GPL.  
Did SCO not distribute said Linux code itself under the GPL?  If so 
(caldera), then it would seem to me that all grounds for lawsuit are 
quite simply moot given that they have thus granted everyone a license 
to modify and distribute said code.

Does this then leave Novell in a position to pull the same "we own 
linux" trick in a few years?

Of course, when the lesser of two evils slays the greater, it becomes 
the greater.  Thus, the first half of the beer is cheers and the second 
is tears.

I think Dell is experiencing what we all already experienced...; that  
is that Linux is a cusotm OS tool and that there are too many distros  
out there that make it an offering that is "consistent" across the  
consumer market place.

I have certainly read - right here on this list even - how a particular
piece of hardware worked fine with one distro, but not another. I am
not referring to 64-bit v. 32-bit, because that is a somewhat different
kettle of fish. I mean something like, e.g., a wireless device working
fine with Fedora but not with Ubuntu. Or vice-versa. 

I don't get this. I can understand philosophical issues with closed
source drivers, but if there is an open source Linux driver for the
device, why is it not available on all distros? I guess I don't
understand how device drivers work.

Most distributions have their own set of patches that they pick and
choose from various sources, and then apply to the kernel tree before
building it and sending it out into the wild. (Opinions vary as to
whether or not this is a good idea.) It's quite possible that
Distribution A might have patched in a driver that's not yet included
in the mainline kernel tree, while Distribution B didn't bother.

I have a 14xx at my office, I think it's a 1405. Anyway, it uses the same
chassis as the 1420, the guts are just a little different. That painted
metal bit looks brand new after nearly a year of use. FWIW. I've had pretty
good luck with Ubuntu on their Latitude 620, though the Broadcom wireless it
typically comes with is a little dodgy. Easy enough to replace with a $25
Intel 2945 though.

And as far as the original question, take a look at systems from System 76
and ZaReason if Dell doesn't come up with anything you like. They might have
something that suits you. http://www.system76.com and
http://www.zareason.com.

Right, simple kernel version and compile options can have an impact as well.
For instance, I recently picked up an Everex 2052 for my wife. Found it on
clearance at Best Buy, and according to the specs everything should "just
work". Turns out that the particular revision of the realtek ethernet chip
that it uses requires a specific flag to be turned on in the kernel at
compile time. If that flag isn't flipped, then the machine hangs when that
module loads. Turns out that in Ubuntu 7.04 it's not set "right", but in
5.04 it was. That was a pain to get around... Oh, and they lied about what
wireless chipset was in it. The spec sheet said intel, it turned out to be
something else altogether with really poor support. Yet another 2945 from
Amazon later, and everything is shiny.

I know you asked about a Dell system that comes with linux installed but
I thought I would chime in anyway.

I have a Precision M90 that works perfectly with Debian, it has a large
screen (wide) and the only drawback is that it's pretty heavy.  Since it
is a business class system you might have the option of getting it with
no OS.

I have a very old Toshiba Portege.  It is very small,
thin, and light. It has a magnesium case, and is very
convenient to tote around.  

The problem I have is I need to find a distro to run
on it. It is a pentium 233, with 32 megs onboard
ram(and a proprietary ram slot for another 64megs, not
used). It has an external bus connected floppy drive,
and an available USB port for an external cd/dvd rom.
It also has a 2 gig hard drive in it(which is very
burried).
  
I have wireless ethernet available, and a variety of
cards I can use for this in it. Worst case, I can use
a pcmcia ethernet card for it. 

I dont want to do anything special with it, just
something for web based email and some streaming music
while on the road. I want a GUI interface, any desktop
environment is fine, but lightweight is a must. Easy
package management would be a huge plus. 

Can anyone suggest a distro that will not be fully
outdated, and will be fairly easy to install with
these limited restrictions? I have wireless ethernet
available, and a variety of cards I can use for this
in it. Worst case, I can use a pcmcia ethernet card
for it. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions or advice.

I'd start with Damn Small. I have a Toshiba Libretto with even less
horsepower (Pentium MMX 133 MHz, 1.5 GB hard drive, 32 MB of RAM) that I
 bought with Windows 95 on it. I lost the W95 install floppies, but I
managed to get DOS 5.0 onto it and from there to bootstrap Debian Woody
on it. IIRC it was using a KDE 2.x desktop -- I haven't brought it up
recently.

You can probably get Etch to load on it over the network if you can boot
either a floppy or a CD ROM -- the Libretto couldn't boot CD-ROMs and
could only boot DOS and Windows floppies, which I why I had to use DOS
5.0 to get install images onto the hard drive. But if you can boot a
CD-ROM, Damn Small should work.

So, for that matter, should a Gentoo 50 MB basic install CD. Gentoo is
probably going to be easier to strip, since you can build a lightweight
kernel rather than having to use the pre-built one that just might be
too big.

As far as a desktop is concerned, I think Damn Small still uses Fluxbox,
but IceWM should also work. I don't know about the others, like
WindowMaker/GNUstep, Afterstep or Enlightenment -- they may be too heavy
for only 32 MB of RAM.

I suggest trying Ubuntu or Mandrake. I have used both. Mandrake may 
require a monetary purchase. You can download the install CD for Ubuntu. 
Both Ubuntu's and Mandrake's install process is very easy to follow. If 
you prefer the Gnome desktop, then I suggest using Ubuntu. If you prefer 
the KDE desktop, then I suggest using Mandrake. If you don't care about 
a desktop environment and you prefer using the command line, then you 
may want to consider Gentoo; however, Gentoo's install process is fairly 
time consuming.

  I had a similar set of requirements for an old Dell Inspiron 3500
that I fixed up for a friend.  She wanted it to use the machine for
field astronomy and to access the occasional open wireless AP.  I
tried a number of the full size and small distros, but none of them
fit my needs.

  The limited CPU cycles and memory of the target platform was the big
issue.  The big KDE and GNOME based distros all had race bugs in the
GUI that eventually killed the machine.  The dedicated small distros
ran well, but were all missing features or apps I was looking for.  I
ended up loading the machine with Xubuntu, running the Xfce desktop.
It's been up and running for around 8 months now with no major issues.

   I, too, have a Portege 3025CT. Great travel machine! Mine has 96M RAM and
it ran Red Hat-7.3 before I put Slackware on it. I don't recall which
Slackware-10.x is on it now. It ran fine with Xfce.

   The CD-ROM drive I have connects via a PCMCIA card.

I'm not sure I agree with using gentoo, unless you want to do some
off-the-wall things to help bring down the root filesystem size.  You
could NFS mount /usr/portage to another machine, as well as
/var/db/pkg and /var/tmp/portage.  But it seems simpler from a
maintainence standpoint to use a distro that you can update without
gymnastics.  Perhaps you never intend to update it, though.  I'll bet
that the size of the portage files is greater than the size of the
debian bloat-kernel.

Why choose gentoo over debian?  The #1 reason is architecture-specific
builds.  With a CPU that supports no more than the standard x86
architecture and has no mmx or sse instruction sets, is gentoo worth
the hassle?  This is coming from the self-proclaimed number one
diehard gentoo fanatic in the world.  Naturally I would use gentoo for
this project.

Which browser to use?  Here I am at a loss, for any mozilla-like
browser will eat 50M RAM in a hurry.

1. Even though the minimal Gentoo installer CD-ROM (about 50 MB) is
command line only, you can install a desktop with it over the network.

2. I'd be surprised if any full-sized (700 MB) LiveCD/GUI installer
could survive in only 32 MB of RAM, although I'd love to see someone
prove me wrong. :) I'd be looking at the tiny ones like Debian's boot
image (under 10 MB IIRC), Damn Small (still under 50 MB IIRC) or
Gentoo's 50 MB. Gentoo *does* have a LiveCD/Install CD now, but I think
it's i686 or better, not i386 or i586.

Yeah ... Portage is about 100 MB now, whereas the little chunk of disk
that APT uses on a Debian box is pretty small.

Browsers -- Damn Small used to use Dillo, but IIRC you can install it
and then get Firefox. If it's *just* browsing you want, the text
browsers will work. But Dillo is OK if you don't need
Java/Javascript/ActiveX stuff -- just text and pictures. Downloads you
can do with text-based utilities like curl and wget if you have to.

Ok, so I think that Gentoo, Debian, and DSL will run
on it fine...  I am a little worried about package
management and availability will be severely limited
with DSL...  I can do an internet install with Debian,
but I am concerned that it might be too much OS for my
limited hardware, remember 233mhz and 32megs ram. The
Gentoo looks like a good option, but I am worried
about the complexity of the install. This leaves me
with 2 questions of course...

1. What is the popular opinion of DSL and the
available packages for it?  It appears that if
installed to the HD it installs as debian. will I be
able to run apt-get and install any standard
debian-compatible packages? 

2. Does anyone know if Debian will be too sluggish on
this hardware?  If so, what can be done to slim it
down? 

One last idea I have is this... I have windows 2000
running extraordinarily slowly on it right now(I got
it that way). I could run a windows based linux
installer on it, or I could put a boot loader and
source media on the hard disk and reboot that way. 
Any suggestions as far as this goes?

As far as I can recall, you can install Debian packages, although I
think DSL has their own repository and some hacks to the pure Debian "apt".

My only concern would be the kernel fitting in RAM ... everything else
you should be able to lighten up. Just do a command-line-only install
(base Debian) to start and add packages sparingly. There *are* kernel
build tools in Debian, I just don't know how to use them. ;)

Debian won't necessarily be any more or less sluggish than other
distributions. It all depends on what packages you have installed and
running. Steer clear of kitchen sink distributions that include a
boat-load of desktop crap in their default installs. If you choose
Debian, perform a minimal ("base") install, and then add only what you
need, piecemeal.

Like others here, I have an old Toshiba Libretto (Pentium 266, 64 MB
RAM), and Debian runs just fine. I use the Ion window manager, and
have a custom-compiled kernel. If you're happy living mostly on the
command line, an old Pentium will work OK.  Unfortunately, there are
no usable web browsers for a machine that old. Dillo is suitable for
simple sites, but worthless for anything approaching modern.  Opera is
tolerable, sort of; Firefox is maddeningly slow.

Is it really that difficult to pull the hard drive on that laptop?
Plugging the hard drive into a desktop system is almost always less
stressful than trying to figure out a clever way to install directly
on oddball old hardware.

switch is only 8 ports, and is only 10/100. So not only is it the
bottleneck, but I could use more ports. Right now I have to move cables
from the switch to different jacks on the patch panel in order to use
some of the wall jacks. This is getting to be a pain, because I have
seven printers and three computers. Therefore, I am in the market for a
24-port gigabit switch. However, my laptop and all but one of my
printers are only 10/100, and I have one older printer that is only 10
mb, so I need a switch that is smart enough to do 10/100/1000. My new
desktop is gigabit and my next laptop will be gigabit as well, and the
black and white printers don't need to be any faster.

A quick check on eBay revealed 24-port gigabit switches ranging in
price from ~$100 to $1,800, with MSRPs reported as high as $3,900. I
haven't googled for prices, or looked at Fry's or Enu, because it
suddenly occurred to me that there must be some huge differences in
quality or features that I am unaware of. Therefore, I decided it would
be a good idea to ask someone who knows about this stuff first.

I also need to replace my 10/100 router. Do they make router/switch
combos? Would that be a better idea than separate switch and router?
Any recommendations?

PS, when all is done there is going to be some surplus cat5e stuff to
give away.

   I, too, had no issues before. Changing permissions and group to match what
you have still does not bring up the application. Strange.

Cost-wise, you'll be better off buying several 8-port switches (or
similar port-density) and patching them together to achieve the same
total port count, than paying for a single device with a higher count
in-chassis.  Netgear 8-port gigabit switches are cheap, functional,
and good enough for home-office use, IMO.   If you want higher-end
manageable gear, I'd be happy to give suggestions as well.  I always
prefer to have the best equipment I can afford :)

When you say your 10/100 router, is that a consumer broadband router,
or an actual multi-link routing device?  There are several models of
consumer devices that have even gigabit switches (usually 4-port)
onboard... but it's useless considering american broadband speeds
(unless you're on direct fiber).  I'd suggest upgrading to whatever
model that has the feature set you want, and chaining your gigabit
switches one of the ports from the gateway device.  That way you have
full gig connetions between all devices excepting the internet
gateway, which is the bottleneck outbound anyway.   If you have only
100mbit ports on the gateway's onboard switch, make sure you don't
plug each switch into one of those ports, or you obviously restrict
bandwidth between switches.

I've personally just picked up an Apple Airport Extreme, the newer one
with 802.11n, and am quite happy... the only caveat so far is the need
to have a windows VM around to modify it if none of my mac laptops are
at home.  Several companies are making similar parts with built-in web
interfaces and nearly-identical feature sets now.

Gigabit switches auto-adjust to whatever speed is needed.

I've used OvisLink (semi-)managed 24-port switches.  Other cheap Asian
off-brands should work OK.  Eli's idea of using a bunch of 8-port
switches has its appeal, since you'd have some redundancy if the switch
fails.  OTOH, it means a less pretty setup with more wall-warts, and a
bit less bandwidth in some cases.

Warning: Many cheap switches will have a bunch of 10/100 ports, and a
couple 10/100/1000 "uplink" ports.  That is not what you seek.

As for the router, just plug that into the gigabit switch.  Unless
you're using it to route between VLANs (if you have to Google it, you're
not doing it;) or your internet connection is faster than 100Mbps, it
won't be slowing things significantly.

Me, I can't wait for a PC I can run off power-over-ethernet.

OT now, but if you have a low-enough power laptop you could build your
own breakout box for POE to run it.  Obviously, if it's that low-power
the requirement to use 100bt signaling is unlikely to be an issue ;)
POE switches are usually fairly pricey however, unless you wanted to
hack up a 100mbit switch to inject power into the unused pairs...

;)

John,
I've had really good luck with Dell branded gear. Its not super spendy but
not sure what your budget is.

http://www.dell.com/content/products/compare.aspx/network_agg?c=us&cs=04&l=en&s=bsd

I have worked a little bit with the Netgear stuff and it seems suitable for
SOHO apps so that might be the cheaper router for you.

Actually, power can be injected into used or unused pairs, as Galen
and I discovered when he helped me hack one of the PoE switches to
work with some pre-802.3af gear.  The power is DC and the signalling
is AC and there is some kind of isolation going on.  GigE uses all the
pairs, afterall.

I've had good experiences with Netgear, SMC, Dell, and HP; in increasing
order of price. If you don't want / need management, the Netgear or SMC tier
will serve you well. If you do, HP has a new line, the 1800 series which is
very nice, and quite affordable for the feature they offer. A 24-port, IIRC,
runs about $500. It has all the management bells and whistles you could ask
for, except STP and similar "enterprise class" redundancy and
high-availability sorts of things.

I'd also have to warn away from the suggestion of daisy-chaining several
smaller switches. Speaking as someone who has had as many as five, and
currently has 3, switches in a my home "wiring closet", I long for the day
when I will have the unallocated disposable income to replace them with a
single device. The extra cabling and complexity is a constant hassle, and
getting away from that would be worth the cost of a switch.

Assuming you mean a typical SOHO router, I'd have to ask why you want to
replace it. I'd suggest just plugging into your gig switch and getting on
with life. They do make converged router / switch devices for the home
market, but I only recall seeing one that did gigabit, which seems to be
your main goal; and it certianly was not 24 ports.

Thanks to you and others for the responses.

After more consideration (and looking at prices) I have decided I can
do with a 16-port switch. Some of the jacks I installed in the house
are only in case I decide to move furniture, so 24 ports are not
essential. 

I am considering the Netgear GS116 16-port switch. Fry's has it for
$149.00:

http://shop3.outpost.com/product/4094232?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG

I found lots of more expensive switches (way more expensive!), but they
all had features that I don't think I need. I just have a home office
and all I want is throughput. On the other hand, I don't understand
what some of the features of the expensive models really do. If anyone
has any negative comments about the GS-116, I'd be interested in
hearing them. Also, alternative options.

After further looking it appears that router-switch combos are not easy
to find, and are more expensive than separate components.

However, my router is only 10/100, so I suppose I should upgrade
it to gigabit also. Now I need to go research routers. :(

Unless you are wanting to set up multiple gigabit networks in your
home, I don't see why you'd need a gigabit router.  You can plug your
switch into the router as 1000Base-T will work with 100Base-T by the
definition of the specification.  For most homes/small offices a
gigabit router isn't needed.  Then again maybe you have a specific
need.

The more expensive managed switches give the ability to manage traffic
going through the switch, enable/disable ports remotely, etc.  If you
don't think you need the features, you probably don't need them.

I got a 3Com 3C16485 switch for $140 that was a 'last generation' 
closeout.  The features include 4 SPF ports (for fiber modules which 
apparently cost $150 each or so), trunking (ability to parallelize 
multiple ports into a single link (to another switch or a multi-nic 
linux box), and port mirroring (mirror all traffic onto one port for 
network analysis.)  There's also VLAN (partitioning) and basic 
monitoring/limiting.

While I don't actively use any of those features (though I definitely 
plan to use the trunking at some point), I find that it has 
significantly reduced the flakiness of my network compared to the 
couple of unmanaged linksys switches that I had previously.  It does 
have a fairly loud fan, but no wall-wart.

If you're actually plugging 16 computers into it, managed is probably 
the way to go.

Where did you get it for that price?

I have only three computers, and one is my old Windows 2000 desktop
that is now rarely turned on. Most of my network activity is to the
internet. Assuming the server on the other end can push the bits out, I
have seen Comcast give me download speeds fast enough to get a 700 MB
live CD in 10 minutes. It's also nice to make backups faster - mostly
the laptop to the desktop. But mostly I just want the speed for web
viewing. I see quite a difference between my 10/100 laptop and my new
gigabit desktop when it comes to downloading, in spite of the fact that
my router and switch are only 10/100. From what I have read about
managed it is probably way overkill for me, but the 3C16485 sounds much
better than the Netgear GS116, and if I can get one for $150, cheaper
too.

From ictcompany.com, but it looks like it might have been a total fluke 
in their pricing (given that today's page implies that they intend to 
sell one (yes, one) sfp module for $1600.)  Random much?  It was 
refurbished and limited quantity, so YMWV.

   The power supply on my Hyundai LCD monitor finally died this morning so I
had to purchase a replacement monitor. Most of those offered for sale
nowadays seem to be the wide variety, for reasons I do not understand.
(However, I don't play games or watch movies on my computers so my lack of
understanding may be reasonable.)

   Anyway, I bought locally (Staples) because the cost in lost time and gas
of driving to Fry's would have doubled the price of one of their monitors,
and I ended up with an Acer AL1916W because it's a clearance special. I
added the native 1400x900 resolution to /etc/X11/xorg.conf and the sync
frequencies are fine. But, everthing is stretched horizontally and is
uncomfortable to read. This is especially true as most of my work is done in
virtual consoles in text mode.

   The video card is an ATI Rage 128 Pro Ultra; my Google search did not
produce the range of resolutions it is capable of supporting, but one hit
suggested that the card cannot support wide screen resolutions. Could my
inability to switch video modes to the 1400x900 resolution be card related?

   If I do need a new card, are there any brands/models to avoid? I'll
probably go to ENU this afternoon, but put off shutting down, replacing
hardware, and rebooting until the weekend.

   This issue has been mooted by my need to replace the monitor with the
built-in speakers (which did have built-in volume control anyway, but I
never used that). I ended up buying a pair of external speakers (more desk
clutter), and they have a volume control.

   Also, alsamixer works as a user even if aumix won't. Shrug.

Thanks all!

I think the native resolution for that monitor is actually 1440x900,
which could be the culprit.  Might be worth double-checking your
xorg.conf for that.  (Amazon's tech specs on the AL1916W claim
1440x900 res.)

Huh.  So is X handling the resolution OK, or is it stretched too?

As for console, you may be SOL unless you use framebuffer console (and
that may not work either.)  Have you tried booting with "vga=ask" on the
kernel commandline to see what's available?

I've been using an Nvidia FX-5500 with a widescreen monitor, but any of their recent video cards would probably work.

Rogan,

   Argh! Good catch. I just made the changes, but the only two modes
available with xvidtune are 1280x1024 and 1024x768. Let me try killing X,
logging out and in and seeing if that makes a difference ... Nope.

   I think it's the card.

Many thanks,

Rich

   Everything is stretched.

   That's interesting. I just looked at /etc/lilo.conf and I see that the
highest resolution is 1024x768, which is what's used when I boot. On
previous monitors (the squre ones), it's been quite readable even when X is
running at 1280x768. I've not noticed any issues with pine, slrn, emacs, or
my other console apps, either.

   Think it's time to visit ENU.

Many thanks,

Rich

Is there some reason why the reply-to for many postings on this list is
set to the author's email address?  Am I alone in considering this
policy annoying.

If you need a PCI card look for a nVidia MX440.

If you need a APG card I would go with a Nvidia GeForce 5200.

Both cards have worked well for me especially with wide screens at 1680 
x 1050

mark,

   Thank you. I bought an ATI Radeon 9550 at ENU. It's an AGP card with both
analog and digital output (as well as TV). This should work with the native
1440x900 on the Acer.

The Reply-To header should always be set to the author's address.  The 
fact that this list munges the headers to set them to the list address is 
not only annoying, but downright broken.

I just bought the Netgear GS116 from frys.com, with free shipping. I'm
sure I could go to Wilsonville and pick it up as well, but I sure can't
drive from N Portland to Wilsonville for free. As for the net price
searches, I didn't find anything else that is really gigabit for all 16
ports for the same price or less. 

Thanks to everyone for the advice and suggestions.

There are many "reply-to-harmful" and "reply-to-not-harmful" opinions out there.

This list is both a community and a very useful knowledge base.
Reply-to-the-list keeps that knowledge flowing back to the community.  It is
more useful for this kind of technical list to have the occasional oops
regarding a private message, than many oops' of useful technical replies heading
towards a private mailbox with no list follow up.

I say keep it the way it is.  At a minimum you get a chuckle out of a private
reply.  At a maximum you get a glimpse into someone's true intentions and
personality.  Occasionally you get an accidental phone # into the archives,
which the admin should be able to help with.

Damn.  The IETF stepped in in 2001 to settle this with RFC 2822.  I love RFCs.
So yeah, down with Reply-To munging and up with RFC 2369 (List-Post header)! ;)

But this is an email list, not a person. The list is effectively the

Yeah, if you'd read the thing I sent, you'd find that reply-to munging 
does NOT actually increase the number of list posts.  It turns out that 
folks generally DO reply to the list when they mean to do so.

Reply-To munging is an attempt to technologically fix a perceived problem 
with people that does not exist.  People aren't dumb (Yeah, Alan, I know 
your opinion) and we don't have to treat them like they are in order to 
get good behavior.

That just doesn't happen.  Also, if it were to happen, the person who 
received the message would just post a "Resolved" message that shared the 
technical information that helped.

Uh, what?  Are you denying me my individuality, nay, my *humanity* by 
claiming I am merely an agent of the list?  I take serious umbrage with 
that assertion.

I am the author of this post and the list merely relays it to you in the 
exact same way that my smtp server relays it to the list.  The list is no 
more the sender (and, indeed, no less) than my smtp server is the sender.

When you reply to this, you may choose to reply to the list or to me. 
Surely you're smart enough to know which you mean.

The message is part of the list, a community discussion & I reply to 
that community. If you  broadcast publicly to the list, don't expect 
a private reply. If you want private, then ask me to reply private.

This is like people in a room - when I reply to your comment I expect 
everyone to hear it. If I want it to go only to your I'll do 
something unusual, like whisper in you ear or look through the 
headers for you email address.

Really?  Because when I'm in a room with a bunch of folks, I'll talk to 
the person I'm facing in a polite voice, but if I want the whole room to 
hear, I'll speak up and maybe even ask for attention before doing so. 
Just seems way more polite than shouting everything to everyone.

But the real point here (despite very dumb analogies) is that neither 
replying to the sender alone nore the list alone is particularly difficult 
without the Reply-To munged, but replying to the sender alone is hard
with the Reply-To munged.

So we can fix the list and be RFC compliant or we can do things the 
ignorant, arrogant way that is not only against RFC but assumes people are 
stupid and won't do what they want.

Hear hear.

And this is the problem.  Reply-to munging LOSES INFORMATION THAT
CANNOT BE RECOVERED.  This is bad.  This is wrong.

IF THE REPLY-TO IS NOT MUNGED: If you're on a mailing list, and you want the
whole list to see your reply to a post, YOU HAVE A WAY IN YOUR MAILER TO DO
THAT.  And if you just want the original person to see a side comment, YOU
HAVE A WAY TO DO THAT.  It's about the choice of the person constructing the
reply.

IF THE REPLY-TO IS MUNGED: You *lose* that choice.  This is dumb.  This
accomodates the idiots, while hampering the experts.  You *want* to encourage
experts to reply.

Please stop munging the reply-to.  Please use the headers as they were
intended.

I dont reply in this list often but I need some clarification as to why its
so dificult

at least for me ( maybe gmail is unique in some way your mail clients arn't
) when I hit the reply button the default to is
"General Linux/UNIX discussion and help; civil and on-topic" <
plug at lists.pdxlinux.org>
wich is what it should be in order for me to participate in this discusion

the author of the posts to is in the from, because it is "From" him, so I
can just simply copy and paste that out if I wish to reply to him
by leaving the From header untouched and changeing the Reply to header this
makes it very easy to choose either way

if you are saying this "Munging" removes choice you are clearly wrong as you
have the choice to do it either way,

and its just as easy as if it wern't munged you would still have to do some
copy paste, to reply to everyone, the other thing this mungeing does is
makes it very easy for me to write a filter that keeps all the PLUG mail in
one folder, if that ability was removed I would imediatly unsubscribe from
this list and not bother with it again

I am replying on PLUG-TALK, because this is veering away from a
discussion about Linux and into a discussion about preferences.
Experienced mailing list users should know that disagreements are
unlikely to be solved using email.

No, I'd just have to press 'L' to activate the list-reply feature of
mutt. That's the point various people have been trying to make here:
the "fix" of Reply-To munging makes more work for everyone. There are
already standard e-mail features in place to deal with these
situations. The solution is to choose a decent mail client that
supports them.

Again, any modern mail client should give you the ability to filter on
arbitrary headers.

The mail filters on the various email clients are good to use, but you 
need to see how the email client handles "junk" mail as well as mail 
filters. Sometimes the email client's junk mail filter is applied before 
other user defined filters. I had some of my PLUG emails going to my 
junk folder for a while, but I was able to correct that.

Just to toss out random information... I think Gmail is broken in this
regard :( "Reply" is obvious, as is "Forward", and there is a "Reply
All" hidden in a menu, but I've yet to find a "Reply to List"
capability.

I'd also postulate that 'finding a decent mail client' is impossible...

unless you are using mutt apparently...

I don't seem to have reply to list in gmail or outlook, and im not going to
start using a new client just to communicate on an email list,

every list I am currently subscribed to "munges' the reply to,

im subscribed to 6 of them, they all do it,

seems to me im having trouble finding a list that doesn't do it.

anyone care to point me to an example?

Sure:  http://lists.debian.org/

All the Debian mailing lists do things the proper way -- no munging --
and periodically a discussion that quickly devolves into a flame-war
erupts on debian-user over whether the Debian mailing lists should
adhere to standards or adhere to what many perceive as common
expectations.  AFAIK, no person's mind has ever been changed as a result
of these discussions.

With any Debian mailing list, CTRL+L will address a reply to the list
and CTRL+R will address a reply to the sender.  That's quite easy for me
to remember because the standard method of replying to any email is CTRL
+R.  So it has become my habit to think that when I wish to address a
person, I use CTRL+R; when I wish to address a list, I use CTRL+L.

However, with this list, CTRL+L will address a reply to the list and
CTRL+R will address a reply to the list.  (I am using Evolution.)  So to
my way of thinking, PLUG is broken.  In order to reply to a sender off
the PLUG list I have to copy/paste the sender's email address into the
"To" field.  Extra work.  Or I have to do SHIFT+CTRL+R to address a
reply to both the sender and the list, then remember to delete the list
address if I only want to reply to the sender.  Again, extra work.
Extra work is bad, when there is a simple, standards-compliant way to do
things that doesn't involve extra work.

I doubt that will change any minds, but that's the way I see it.

Anybody have Verizon FIOS working with their Linux systems?  The
techs were stringing up fiber cable on our block yesterday, and will
be lighting it up soon.  I am on Comcast now, but they are down
about 10 times per year, and their terms of service do not permit
adding a PTP node.  The Verizon TOS looks less restrictive:

  http://www.verizon.net/policies/popups/tos_popup.asp

Like Comcast, Verizon does not permit servers, but I connect to 
my offsite server with an outbound-only VPN link server, so the
restriction does not bother me.  On the other hand, the Verizon
upload speed is claimed to be 2Mbps instead of Comcast 128Kbps,
and that is fast enough to mount a Samba share at home that the
offsite server can connect to.  I can potentially offer a lot
more stuff than will fit on the 5 Gbytes of the offsite server. 
Bittorrent?  Limited media servers?  I will have to throttle
the bandwidth usage of these extra services, of course, so that
Verizon does not cancel me.  Worst case, I go back to Comcast.

So, what are your experiences with Verizon FIOS?  Restrictions?
Performance?  Uptime?

While going back to Comcast probably isn't a problem, going back to
DSL, or even standard phone, might be:

http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003782083_verizoncopper10.html

Apparently it's non-trivial to get Verizon to leave your existing
copper in place when they do a FIOS install.

I have no personal experience with this, but it's worth knowing about
before you make the plunge.

   Ouch! What's even worse is the lack of alternatives for telephone
providers. If you are in Verizonland, you're stuck with them and can't go to
a different vendor. I suspect there will be more loud screaming and
political/regulatory attention paid in coming years.

Specifically, they block port 80. That's why I opted for a business
account (15/2 for $99.95/mo.). I run my own web and mail server at home.

> So, what are your experiences with Verizon FIOS?

In spite of being an early adopter (Sep 2005), the install was smooth
and the service has been rock solid. I've had 100% uptime (discounting
PGE failures). However, as you might expect, the level 1 support techs
haven't a clue. Fortunately, other than a post-install issue, I haven't
had to call.

As noted above - but none for my business class account.

As promised, measured with a variety of online tools.

100% as long as PGE doesn't interfere...

 14:25:53 up 243 days, 15:36,  6 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.04, 0.01

If you get a business (aka data only) account, they won't snip your
copper if you make it clear to them that's what you want. I still have
POTS on my landline.

Thanks for the info and pointer.  I would like to keep the copper,
but the phone wires in our area are 50 years old and pretty flaky
anyway, so if I go back to Comcast I can live with the Verizon
battery box outside to power the phones.  I have a UPS system and
a generator to keep it alive in an extended emergency.

Note that some systems such as the LifeLine personal monitors (such
as my mother used in her last independent years) do not work well
with anything but old-style POTS copper.  Hopefully there are modern
offerings that do, if such become needful.

Keith

POTS = Plain Old Telephone Service, BTW.

WOW! I guess the telecommunications industry is still trying to maintain 
service under a monopoly business model. We are now experiencing that TV 
and Radio will no longer be free, but rather require a digital 
subscription to a private company (i.e., Comcast, Qwest, Verizon, etc.). 
I'm hoping that local governments will step up to the plate and realize 
that they can offer telecommunication services for much less to their 
constituents and provide good revenue stream to fund other public 
services to their communities.

I've had FIOS business at my house for 1.5 months which comes with 4
static IPs, and is $99/mo.  I moved away from Easystreet DSL where I
have one phone line (forwarded).

I declined the Dlink router ($99) as I had my own (sarge/shorewall), and
they had a promotion waiving the $99 setup.  I had to fight to have the
router cost removed on my first bill, and even that credit will take 2-3
months to show up on my bill.

I also declined the voice service as I kept the copper for my forwarded
POTS line.  This makes dealing with customer service difficult because
they always want (and their automated system only has the option for) a
phone number.  Calling support consists of hitting "0" 20 times to
convince the system to punt you to a person.

I held off paying the bill a bit while I fought the router charge.  I
was one day late and they turned service off on a Friday night when I
was out of town for the weekend.  My WOW playing roommate was not
pleased, and I have some backups that run over the weekend that are
important.

A call Monday triggered reactivation, which took 8 hours.  According to
the tech, they are quick on the trigger for turning off data-only services.

After WonderShaper was kicked for having values I put in for my DSL
link, speed had been wonderful.  I consistently get 1.1 - 1.9MBytes/s.

wget from mirrors.kernel.org:

In the end I think I'm going to stick with it for a while.
 * I'm saving ~$30/mo over the DSL link
 * The speed is much faster
 * I've traded excellent customer service (Easystreet) for Verizon, whom
I loath even thinking of having to call with issues
 * Being fiber, the last-mile infrastructure is in place for many
interesting opportunities (if Verizon is smart)
 * Wish they would just terminate it at the Easystreet datacenter

Hello,
I'm using Verizon FIOS since December 2006.
So far it's working flawlessly.

Where did you get this idea???
I have five static IPs assigned to me by Verizon FIOS service.
I have my own mail servers running on those IPs.
All ports are available, nothing is blocked by Verizon.
Try asking for Verizon FIOS Freedom Package.

FIOS vs DSL is a lightning bolt vs a snail.
So far my FIOS was up 24x7 maintaining consistent performance without any 
service interruptions.
BTW, I still have old copper POTS connected to my house but disconnected from 
the Verizon circuits.

Yikes. You must have the Extra-Crappy package. I haven't had any
downtime at all (not since I replaced the crummy coax they provided,
at least), and uplink is a reliable 392 kb. Several months ago I noticed
that the first few seconds of uploads were getting fantastic rates
(upwards of 2 Mb). I assumed Comcast was making "burst" allowances to
pad their scores on bandwidth tests, or something.

They call it "speed boost technology" ... whatever that means. I've had good
luck with the  8/1 package from them with very little downtime in 4 years
somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 days total I think *knock on wood*. I'd
jump at the chance to get FIOS if I had the chance though.

Smart move by Citrix, and I'm glad they beat M$ to it.  Virtualization
is the buzzword-du-jour now that users have discovered that Winders is
happiest in a VM and vendors have discovered that VMs sell fa$ter boxes.

Except for hosting and testing (and maybe clustering), I don't get the
value of Linux-inna-VM but I'm willing to be enlightened.

The current Xen is GPL and in the kernel, so you're safe.  I think KVM
can run VMware and/or Xen images so you may be even safer.

Using Seamonkey/Win32 here.  Reply-to is auto set to the list for me.

I've been reading the replies to this and it seems it's maybe how 
different people brains work that determine how they think how list 
replies should work.  For me, joining the list for public discussion was 
the whole point.  Therefor it makes sense to me that the "default" 
action in replying would go to the list.  I've privately emailed people 
on the list as well, which causes me to do something other than the 
default to make the reply only go only to them.  All the lists I'm part 
of work this way.

1. The ability to give each major application it's own OS installation.
That way individual components can be upgraded without impacting other
components.  Last time I ran into this I had 8 applications running in a
failover cluster, the user wanted to upgrade one of the applications but it
required an upgrade to a newer kernel to work.  Problem was one of the other
applications couldn't run with the newer kernel.  Then end result is the
user ended up having to purchase additional hardware and do a new
installation and migration instead of an upgrade.

2. Removes the dependency on the hardware.  This makes hardware upgrades
much easier.  It also is very useful for things like migrations to different
sites.

3. Better balancing of hardware resources.  If I have a multiple node
failover cluster and I find one node is over-utilized and the other is
under-utilized I would need to perform a failover to balance the load, which
would interrupt service during the failover and drop existing connections.
The higher end VM clusters can dynamically move a running VM to the other
server without a service interruption.

4. Easy roll-back.  When doing patching or updates to the OS or application
in a VM performing a snapshot prior to starting the work makes rolling back
the changes if an issue arises much faster and less error prone.

I have not seen a Linux Clinic announcement from Aaron, so that can only
mean he has been captured by giant mutant ground squirrels.  That would
explain the filbert with "announce clinic" carved into it, wedged
between the empty laudanum bottles piled next to my bed.  Hopefully,
Aaron will gnaw through the roots and vines binding him, and join us
Sunday, August 19, at 1PM at Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th in Portland.

You can join us too, bringing your Linux machine (we have monitors,
keyboards, and meece) for us to tame and discipline (we are very 
strict).  Or your Windoze machine for us to ridicule with great mirth
and hilarity.  Or your Fry's $5 wireless card for us to run through
the industrial blender.  You can even bring your Linux expertise, 
which we will cherish, and apply heroically to bugs great and small.

Besides, Sunday will be cool and rainy, no fun for camping, even if
you manage to elude the giant mutant ground squirrels.

Subject: [PLUG] best email client for offline use?
Message-ID: <20070816225655.GQ9493@amethyst.spiritone.com>

I don't care if it has a gui or is just ncurses-based, but I want an
email client (with POP and/or IMAP support) that works well offline,
e.g. when I'm on a long airplane flight.  Open-source and on Linux, of
course.

By working well, I mean letting me compose mail to be sent once I'm
connected again, delete, mark as read, move into folders, etc.

It'd be nice if the program handled multiple email accounts well.

Suggestions?

Thanks,

As the saying goes: "All mail clients suck. [mutt] just sucks less."

That being said I use Mozilla Thunderbird for all the reasons you state
above, plus that it's cross-platform.  For me that means I can help
folks running Thunderbird on Windows and OS X even though I run it under
Linux.

I didn't have a problem.  I asked the installer to leave the copper in
case things didn't
work correctly.  I told them I had my own router and was using Linux.
The provided
theirs and it had problems.  They replaced theirs with mine and anything worked
just fine.
I am currently getting 5117(down)/1873(up) kbps

The network speed test I am using is from here.
http://or-speedtest.integra.net/
The Verizon guys were using it instead of the ones from broadband reports.

I was reluctant to switch and asked a lot of questions.  They have a
EULA agreement
like the one that is posted in another post.  I actually talked to the
techs and did my own
port scan.  The only thing they currently block (last I checked
May/June 2006) is port 80TCP.  Test and confirmed with nmap.  I had my
home router setup to respond to
pings to simplify testing.

I currently run hamachi to and from home for remote access.  Almost
like I am at work.

I've had great success running Starcraft (and the extension) under
plain-old wine on many linux boxen -- even as slow as a dual celeron
366.   Might be worth trying.    I'm at work or I'd track down the
starcraft under wine howto, but it should be pretty easy to pull up on
google.  I'd expect that the Warcraft 2 requirements are a strict
subset of Starcraft's.

If you're going to go virtual machine and actually run Windows, I am
very pleased with VirtualBox and would suggest you give it a try. It's
free, and I found it simple to install. (It's in the Ubuntu amd64
repositories even.) I have a license for Windows 2000 and another for
XP, but I use only Windows 2000 because it does everything I need and I
don't have to deal with activation. VirtualBox comes up in about two
seconds and Windows 2000 boots in another 15 seconds. Everything just
works.

I also use Crossover Office on my laptop, but I don't play games, so I
can't say what problems you might have. Apps run as fast in it as they
did when I used to run them in Windows, but it takes a long time to
launch an app because of having to load wine first.

VMware under Windows as the host will run guest OS's full screen.  Does 
it not under Linux?

512MB is baseline at the most. 1GB is the minimum on most computers 
these days and 2GB is the new 1GB.  If you're running VM's then you are 
going to want more than 512MB.  Let the guest OS breath a little.

VMware server is cheaper than both.

I've used both VMware Server and VMware Workstation on a (Gentoo) Linux
host system and they both do full screen just fine.

If the Host has only 512 MB, you're going to have problems with more
than one guest or one guest over about 128 MB.

I've forgotten ... the original goal was to get a game running, right?
P3 desktops are dirt cheap these days -- pick one up, load Windows 2000

Anyone can run an illegal copy of 2000 on a cheap PIII.  I really don't
want to.  Hoping that Microsoft won't care is pushing your luck.  My
vmware installations of XP are legal, but that route still forces me
to come up with a usable copy of Windows.  Microsoft Office 2003 seems
to work fine in CrossoverLinux, which is just wine taken a step further.
I went ahead and bought the standard version.  Number one, I want the
product to get better.  Two, it will support software I might have to
use without pulling out Microsoft Windows.  The license, which I read,
seems to respect the GPL, LGPL, and BSD licenses on various parts of
CrossoverLinux.  The idea of bottles is very appealing for dealing with
Windows apps.

Full screen Warcraft II runs too slow even in 
VMware Workstation 6.0 which I don't have an evaluation license
for anymore.  The player doesn't seem to allow full screen.  For
a game that will work on a Pentium 90 to run too slow even under
emulation on a Pentium 4 2.4 Ghz machine strikes me as odd.

I have enough computers as it is.

Running vmware player in higher resolutions is possible, but only with
VMWare Tools, which you have to extract from a VMware Player install,
or download elsewhere.  I'm not advocating this, since I'm not clear
of the legality of doing so, but it does work.  (just chiming in so
it's on the record -- it might improve performance too, but I doubt
it.)

Subject: [PLUG] detecting integer overflow in C
Message-ID: <20070818230757.GA13547@gate.kl-ic.com>


Is there an easy way to detect integer overflow in C? 

In other words, if I add 1 to INTMAX, I will probably get an overflow
and the result will be a negative number on a two's complement machine.

The X86 processor (and most other processors) has a hardware status
bit that gets set when an overflow happens;  how do I access that in
a C program?  Is there a library call or a conditional I can test?

Who said anything about an illegal copy? I've got an ancient legal copy.
The problem would be when (if they haven't already) Microsoft stopped
putting out Windows Updates for it.

I'll start by saying "I don't know the answer to your question".
However, I did think of this, fwiw.  If it is really just a case of
adding one, then the test is easy, you just check the value before you
add one.  Since that is so easy, and you aren't stupid, I'll assume
that the problem is more complex than that, more like N + M where N
and M are arbitrary.  One solution to getting the hardware status bit
might be to use inline assembly, which gcc supports, to look at the
status bit.  Another solution might be to use GMP
<http://gmplib.org/>, a land where values never overflow (as long as
there is memory to represent them).

I googled glibc integer overflow and didn't see anything particularly
relevant in the first couple pages of hits.  Maybe there is something
in the glibc documentation.

FWIW.

One nice property of signed two's complement arithmetic is that in fact
it does not matter how large M and N are. This is the way it works:

1. If you add a positive number and a negative number, it can't overflow.
2. If you add two positive numbers and the result is negative, you've
had exactly one overflow. The lower bits of the sum are correct, but you
need another "word" above that to hold the carry out that the overflow
signaled, which is exactly +1.
3. If you add two negative numbers and the result is positive, you've
had exactly one overflow. Again, the low order bits are correct, but you
need to put all ones (-1) in the upper word rather than +1 as you did
with addition.
4. To subtract M from N, take the two's complement of M and add it to N,
using the rules above. :)

This, by the way, is one reason sign-and-magnitude and one's complement
architectures died out -- it takes more logic to do this than it does in
two's complement. Logic gates used to cost a lot more than they do these
days.

And this, by the way, is one reason Forth will never die -- because this
stuff is built in to Forth. I actually thought it was built in to C too,
but it's been a long time since I did any embedded programming in C.

They already have.  It's in extended support now, which means only 
critical updates.  But Win2K didn't even get the DST update, which I 
vote as critical.  Computers need to know what time it is.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0708191449340.9810@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I just swapped in the new Sapphire/ATI Radeon 9550 video card to enable
1440x900 dip resolution on the new wide screen monitor. Naturally, X does
not like having the old r128 driver specified in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.

   Looking via Google for information on what driver to specify, I stopped at
the ATI web site and they have a proprietary driver available for download.
I suspect that there's already a suitable driver in the modules for the
running 2.6.19.2 kernel, but I've no idea which one to use.

   Does anyone know what works with this chipset?

Radeon 9550 is based on the ATI R300 chipset. The X.org 'radeon'
driver should work just fine. You could also specify 'ati' in
xorg.conf, and X will auto-select the correct driver (which would
still be 'radeon'). `man radeon` for more details.

The Free X.org driver works fine for most everything but accelerated
3-D. If you find yourself falling behind during those all-night
Quake 4 sessions, you might need the proprietary drivers.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics Meeting

Location:   Jax Bar and Grill

Topic:	    Detecting and Dissecting Rootkits in Linux
Speaker:    Alan Olsen
            Advanced Topics Coordinator
            Programmer, Sysadmin and Troublemaker

Rootkits are the spyware of the Linux world.  We will be discussing what
they are, where and how they hide, and what they actually do.  I will be
covering the various types of rootkits, including the dreaded (and
overhyped "Blue Pill"), kernel rootkits, and the stuff that the script
kiddies just left on your server an hour ago.  Included will be the
tools used to find the various types of rootkits, as well as defensive
measures.

Alan Olsen has been working with Linux since 1994.  Computers since
1972.  His first program was written in Fortran on punch cards for a
Honeywell mainframe.  This makes him feel very old.

Standard Meeting Rules apply.

Standard meeting rules (from October 18th 2000) as written by Zot
O'Connor:

1) The speaker has 15 minutes free. No abusing the speaker for 15
minutes. After that, its a free for all.

2) There are stupid questions.  The speaker (and the group) can deem a
question too basic for the topic, too off-topic, or just dumb.  This may
seem rude, but the idea is to stay deep into the topic.  For instance,
given a talk on Cryptography, it can be expected that the room knows all
about public/private key pairs.  The speaker should list topics you are
expected to know before arriving.

3) There should be a lot of questions and feedback from the audience.

4) Everyone, including the speaker should feel like the topic is over
their head.

5) All are invited, but be sure to know that the talk is aimed at
experts/advanced Linux persons (or those that *think* their experts).

   Ah, that's what I was seeking! The radeon driver works just fine. Now I
just need to figure out how to shift the display from 1280x1024 to 1440x900.

   Using shift-alt-+ toggles between 1280x1024 and 1024x768. This is the
screens section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf:

Section "Screen"
     Identifier  "Regular Screen"
     Device      "Sapphire/ATI Radeon 9550"
     Monitor     "Acer LCD"

# If your card can handle it, a higher default color depth (like 24 or 32)
# is highly recommended.

    DefaultDepth 24

     Subsection "Display"
         Depth       24
         Modes "1440x900" "1280x1024" "1024x768"
     EndSubsection
     Subsection "Display"
         Depth       32
         Modes "1440x900" "1280x960" "1024x768"
     EndSubsection

EndSection

   Is there something that I've missed?

Thanks,

Rich

The 'radeon' driver manpage mentions an option called "PanelSize",
which might be helpful if the X server is truly not correctly
detecting the display size (which seems unlikely).

Looking through the X.org log file should tell you what the server
thinks it's dealing with. E.g.,

  $grep -n -A5 'EDID data from the display' /var/log/Xorg.0.log
  507:(II) RADEON(0): EDID data from the display on port 1 ----------------------
  508-(II) RADEON(0): Manufacturer: APP  Model: 9c21  Serial#: 16843009
  509-(II) RADEON(0): Year: 2002  Week: 5
  510-(II) RADEON(0): EDID Version: 1.3
  511-(II) RADEON(0): Digital Display Input
  512-(II) RADEON(0): Max H-Image Size [cm]: horiz.: 32  vert.: 22

There's more in the log file than that (like screen dimensions,
supported video modes, etc.), but you get the idea.

Have you given X a chance to configure itself. Maybe it'll "just
work". Try `X -configure` as root, which should result in an
Xorg.conf.new in /root.

   Yet the monitor carton and specs on the monitor report the native mode as
1440x900, but that's shown in the log as a future mode. I'm puzzled.

   The DPMS is also off, but the monitor blanks after 15 minutes (where I set
it).

   The monitor auto-configures itself every time X is started and killed.
But, I'll try X -configure, too. Stand by ...

   Well, that made no difference. The xorg.conf was placed in /etc/Xll, but
the display resolutions were not altered.

This post has nothing to help with your resolution issue, rather it
addresses the other problems you're likely to have with your ATI card.
I have been working on mine all day, and here's the best howto I found
to get DRI working properly:

http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/DriTroubleshooting

Check out the glxgears numbers I get now:

root at hly19809lx:/usr/src/linux# glxgears 
13359 frames in 5.0 seconds = 2671.735 FPS
13725 frames in 5.0 seconds = 2744.933 FPS
13706 frames in 5.0 seconds = 2741.110 FPS
13738 frames in 5.0 seconds = 2747.431 FPS

I was getting 150 FPS before.

Incidentally, I have the following card, and it is doing 1680x1050
with no funny stuff in xorg.conf.  But my Xorg.0.log shows it as a
perfectly normal video mode.  Sorry I can't help with this one.
Perhaps "future" means a future release of the radeon driver?  The
only other alternative would be a future version of the card, which
would be bad news.

01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV350
[Mobility Radeon 9600 M10]

There is a kernel driver called fb_radeon, and also an Xorg module
called xf86-video-ati which provides a module called radeon.  You want
the radeon driver from xorg.  Don't even build the fb_radeon module,
or it may try to load, and then conflict with the radeon driver.  I
build only the vesa module for emergencies.

I've had problems with recent versions of x.org not recognizing video
configuration unless the machine is booted with all the hardware
connected and files in place.  I'm guessing (hands wave madly) that
on my hardware, this has to do with the HAL hardware abstraction
layer not passing correct information unless it is in a particular
stage of system boot.  So, try setting everything up correctly (which
it sounds like you have done) then rebooting (not just restarting X).

-----------------------------

"Supported Future Video Modes" seemed suspicious.  While googling
for that phrase, I found this:

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=523108

... which sounds somewhat similar.  The resolution of that thread
was this:

+ So I made a modeline that looks like this:
+ Modeline "1440x900 at 60" 106.50 1440 1520 1672 1904 900 903 909 934

-------------------------------

BTW, according to this post:

http://www.redhat.com/archives/rhl-devel-list/2007-April/msg00138.html

+ > What does "Supported Future Video Modes" mean?
+ 
+ It's a list of modes that your monitor supports that weren't in the
+ predefined list back in 1996 or whenever the first EDID spec was
+ written.

-------------------------------

Lastly, I run an ATI card ( Radeon RV100 QY [7000/VE] ) driving a
Viewsonic 1400x1050 display.  Here are my xorg.conf and Xorg.0.log files:

http://www.keithl.com/xorg.conf
http://www.keithl.com/Xorg.0.log

I am running the 32 bit xorg-x11-drv-ati.i386 driver version
6.6.3-3.2.el5 for RHEL5 .  

Perhaps there is something instructive in that.  Good luck, Rich!

Keith,

   I greatly appreciete this suggestion and all the subsequent pointers. I'll
definitely work my way through them as time permits. Right now, I've two
major projects to finish ASAP, so I'll suffer the weird, stretched display a
few more days.

> + So I made a modeline that looks like this:
> + Modeline "1440x900 at 60" 106.50 1440 1520 1672 1904 900 903 909 934

   According to /var/log/Xorg.0.log here, the monitor supports 1440x900 at 75
Hz, not 60Hz. I'll need to look further because I know that an invalid
modeline could damage the monitor; at least, that was the case with CRTs and
I don't know if it's applicable to LCDs.

   That makes sense.

No.  You are highly unlikely to damage an LCD by feeding it with bad 
video timing.

If you can print, then you should be able to print to PostScript (ps)
and then convert to PDF (ps2pdf).  There are also some PDF printers one
can install.  I don't recall the name under Ubuntu.  For Windows,
there's PDFCreator.

Please let us know what you discover and if it works.

Running VMWare server is free as well, and gets you the VMTools.

It actaully depends on the age of the LCD.  Most every LCD was fixed to 
prevent this sort of damage around 1996-1997.  If you have something that 
old, you may want to get something from this century.

And, yes, I have damaged an older LCD by sending it bad data.

Everyone:

   It's working in 1440x900 dpi resolution now, and my eyeballs are starting
to return to normal. It was quite a strain looking at the
horizontally-stretched characters in both text and GUI applications. Thank
you all!

   Using the search term 'Modeline 1440x900' in Google, I found a blog
addressing this exact issue with the Acer AL1916W monitor. It had a modeline
that works, and another one that increases the vertical refresh rate from
75.0 Hz to 76.24 Hz:

Modeline "1440x900" 136.0 1440 1520 1672 1904 900 903 909 934 +HSync +VSync

   I put this in the Monitor section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf, killed the
Xserver, and restarted it. And here it is! It looks great in analog mode,
but I'll pick up the DVI-D cable for $10 and give that a try, too.

   As usual, I learned a lot from you, and I appreciate your contributions.

Alan,

   This is a brand-new unit manufactured week 10 of this year.

> And, yes, I have damaged an older LCD by sending it bad data.

   I no longer have anything that old -- except for my Tandy 102 that is much
older.

   Unfortunately, I have to miss tonight's ATM. The topic is interesting even
to a non-professional like me.

Thanks!

arrangements with my family. I need at least a week prior notice to  
fit this face-to-face meeting in with my family's busy schedule. Do  
other have this difficulty/requirment?

I think you may have missed something. The Advanced Topics meetings
are held on the third monday of the month. You can start planning for
the next one today.

Via a [1] Slashdot post, I read this [2] Ars Technica article about [3]
Copowi (Community Powered Internet), a new-ish ISP available in Oregon
and 11 other western states that is committed to the idea of net
neutrality, at least in principle.  How committed it can or will be in
practice is the subject of some discussion.

Anyway, I checked out the website and found that Copowi is [4] offering
a free Ubuntu CD to all subscribers.  First time I've seen an ISP do
that.  I find that very encouraging.  I presume that means any tech
support help won't automatically begin "click on the Start menu...".

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0708221027060.22339@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   It's been a week since I last synchronized my PDA and jpilot. During this
period I had to shut down the machine to swap video cards. Apparently
something did not start properly when I rebooted, because I no longer have
/dev/tts/USBn.

   I've restarted /etc/rd.d/rc.udev. When I tail /var/log/messages I see that
the sync cable is detected on a USB port; for example,

Aug 22 09:58:13 salmo kernel: usb 1-4: new full speed USB device using
ohci_hcd and address 6
Aug 22 09:58:13 salmo kernel: usb 1-4: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice

   But, 'ls /dev/tts' shows only 0, 1, 2, and 3.

   What might be causing this? I've not lost a port before.

OK. SO the next meeting is on September 17th. What time and where? Is  
this different from the regular PLUG meeting?

google "PLUG advanced topics", and look at pdxlinux.org .  We have
three meetings per month.  The main meeting is first thursday,
somewhere at PSU (it can change), and the advanced topics is third
monday 7pm, at Jax bar downtown (www.jaxbar.com), and the clinic
is the third sunday 1pm, at Free Geek (www.freegeek.org).  

Subscribe to the announcements list at:
  http://lists.pdxlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/plug-announce
... and you will find out about these and other meetings in advance
(most of the time).

All,

About a year back, this group had a discussion about ReactOS.  I looked 
over the archives and read what I found there.

Has anybody been following the development of it?
Does anybody want to share an opinion of what it is and or might become?

My curiosity was peaked when I overheard a discussion of "a version of 
Linux that is Win$$$ compatible" on one of the local ham radio repeaters.

I have not used it, but I have heard of it. It probably does not  
provide the security updates as timely as Microsoft does. All  
operating systems provide their own security updates.

ReactOS is designed as a replacement for Windows NT (i.e., v4.0)

It is "supposed" to be a complete operating system.

They are working to maintain compatibility with other versions going
forward, but the last time I looked it still had quite a ways to go.

Use 'lsof -u wood' and look for deleted files that are still open. The
"FD" column will be "DEL".

So this guy I work with asked me about running linux on a PS3.  Apparently
there is an option to boot directly to Linux in the boot menu.  So I started
looking on Google for "Linux on a PS3" and I came up with this:


http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com/store/index.php?submit=software&submitimg[hardware][solutions]=1

I guess my question is if anybody has seen a PS3 running Linux and is it as
easy as it seems?  Man I wish I had an extra 30 grand to spend.  Come on
Power ball!

At this year's linux symposium Sony gave away some PS3s as prizes. 
I'm fairly certain the machines had linux installed.  There was also a 
PS3-related BOF, and a Cell talk.

I have seen this with applications I have written. It works fine for
me, but the first non-me user will choose just the right key
combination to make it crash miserably.  I bet goodbye-microsoft  is
for x86 only since that would be about the only place where windows is
installed.

Well, if the intent is "goodbye-microsoft", that's a "TOTALLY"  
different beastie than "goodbye-microsoft-windows-on-X86", no?

Microsoft software is certainly running on X86 and PPC, and for some  
sites, ARM, SPARC and Alpha, along with many more, over the years....  
(FWIW, this email is being sent via a DEC Alpha cluster that's been  
running since, oh, at least '98 or so... 9 years of uptime isn't so  
bad, is it?)

I was just being a pedantic bastard about being able to say "goodbye- 
microsoft", when the software that MS has created over the years runs  
on so many systems, including windows on PPC and Alpha boxen.

FWIW, I was not able to test the link on an Altair system (which also  
often runs a MS product).

In order to say good bye to MS, we need to get the Federal, State and  
local governments to do so.

The discussion boards for ReactOS are degrading with loads of junk.  Never
mind that google is the only way to search it which I am admittedly not the
greatest at.  I think it's debatable how much progress is being made, for one
thing the newsletter always seems to have grammatical errors in it.  It never
seems to come out on a consistent schedule.

As far as  updates, who updates an alpha?  There are none FWIK.  I know that
the most significant kernel contributor, Alexey, took a Microsoft job.  
  I guess
an open Windows was less appealing to him than a position working for a famous
Microsoftie.  When a major ReactOS contributors loses faith in it,  
that is worrisome to me at least.  ReactOS 0.3.3 is not in very good  
shape.  It is one
thing to be less than full featured and quite another to be wholly unstable.
ReactOS is still in alpha until 0.5 releases appear.  Instability is the
norm for now...

I ended up buying this motherboard, and you're right--flawless. I
added a 2.1 GHz Athlon 64 X2, and am astounded at how much faster it
is than the 1.2 GHz P3 it replaced (and I was never really
disappointed with the P3). Debian amd64 installed without a hitch.
Everything works.

I'm (temporarily) using an old 10 GB Maxtor (ATA 66). My system still
screams.  I think it actually is the CPU. :-)

Thanks for the recommendation! It's exactly what I was hoping for when
I sent my original e-mail.

I've only seen NT kernel ports to Alpha/AXP64, i386, ia64, x86_64/"x64", MIPS, 
and PPC. The SPARC port by Intergraph was canceled/never released.

Message-ID: <a1505dbe0708271142n479068d4ta061b3cc73e9d514@mail.gmail.com>

To work around a broken html file referenced from a external site I don't
have access to <frame src=""> tag which was recently updated with a broken
image link I'm trying to create a symbolic link from the original file to
the broken file name. However, ln seems to think I'm trying to give it an
option to perform.. I've tried to escape with '-' and \- and
"-_filename.gif" but it all seems to not work.. Any ideas?

$ sudo -u www-data ln -s news_banner.gif '-'_banner.gif
ln: invalid option -- _
Try `ln --help' for more information.

However, This does work but is a different file name so is only half of my
problem solved:

$ sudo -u www-data ln -s arc_right_news.gif arc_right_'-'.gif

Thanks,

Try prefixing the file name with a directory path:

   ln -s news_banner.gif ./-_banner.gif

Use -- to tell ln that its done receiving new switches.

sudo -u www-data ln -s -- news-banner.gif -_banner.gif

Then "-_banner.gif" is taken as an argument, not a switch.

In this example, the single quotes are unnecessary.

Use backslashes to escape charatcets instead.

ln -s arc_right_news.gif arc_right_\-\.gif

Also, you may need to turn on "follow symlinks" on in that directory in 
your Apache config.

Subject: [PLUG] ssh: Too many authentication failures
Message-ID: <20070827200249.GA28367@pickled.herring.org>

Last week I fumble-fingered my passphrase too many times and now when I
attempt to tunnel to my home linux server from work I get...

Received disconnect from 127.0.0.1: 2: Too many authentication failures
for foo
(name has been changed to protect the innocent)

I'm able to ssh in as user "foo" from another box (but it requires two
hops and is thus not secure) - so ssh is somehow aware of the IP
requesting the connection. I googled and also searched the plug archives
to try to discover how to reset the failure count and came up empty. I
restarted sshd, but that had no effect. If I bump MaxAuthTries in
/etc/ssh/sshd_config I can login. I'd prefer to not have to set that
higher than 2, though. I'd also like to avoid rebooting if at all
possible...

 12:52:25 up 255 days, 14:02,  6 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.05, 0.06

I'm using publickey auth. User "foo" is not disabled in /etc/shadow.
Does anyone have a clue how to reset the failure count?

Here are pertinent snippets from sshd_config:

Protocol 2
PermitRootLogin no
MaxAuthTries 2
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes

Yes, I do. But my IP is not logged in /etc/hosts.deny. In fact, I
specifically allow it in /etc/hosts.allow.

Thanks, this worked just fine. As would be expected. I just didn't know

Apache was already reading symlinks. So I'm good to go now.

You may also have to put it on the denyhosts whitelist.

Or it could be something else.

/etc/hosts.allow *is* the whitelist mechanism for denyhosts, so that's
not it. As you say, it could (s/could/must/) be something else. Just
what that is remains the conundrum *sigh*.

You are not able to connect to the box that your are on, i.e. localhost?

What do the log files say?
/var/log/secure
/var/log/messages
/var/log/auth

You may want to try to connect and then type 'ls -latr /var/log/' to see
what got updated last.  If you want to recurse:

$ sudo find /var/log/ | sudo xargs ls -ladtr

Then look at the later entries those log files.

sorry, I should have been more specific about how I'm tunneling in...

On box A: ssh -L1047:herring.org:22 foog at boxB
On box A: ssh -l foo -p 1047 localhost

It's not a case of connecting to localhost from herring.org - it's a
case of not being able to tunnel there from my linux box at work (boxA).
Note that boxA sits inside of the firewall and my employer, in their
infinite wisdown, has shut down incoming and outgoing ssh traffic at the
edge. But boxB is in the DMZ and thus works as an intermediary.

> What do the log files say?
> /var/log/secure

Typical stuff. Failed attempts via the tunnel from BoxA show...

Aug 27 13:53:40 pickled sshd[29209]: Disconnecting: Too many authentication failures for foo

Successful attempts via ssh to BoxB from BoxA, then ssh to
foo at herring.org (which is insecure) show...

Aug 27 14:06:36 pickled sshd[29381]: Postponed publickey for foo from ::ffff:<ip address> port 37341 ssh2

Only "session (opened|closed) for user foo" stuff.

Doesn't exist.

I already checked that, and nothing revealing there. I can do a two-hop
ssh to user "foo", but can no longer tunnel directly (which is far more
secure). 

I've also tried removing the corresponding entry from
/home/foo/.ssh/known_hosts - but that accomplished nothing.

There has to be a way to reset the failure count.

It appears the problem was too many different protocols being used to
authenticate. Taking a clue from a comment on another list where I posed
the question I commented out of sshd_config...

GSSAPIAuthentication yes
GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes

Then set retries back to 2 (I had bumped it to 3 to allow me to tunnel
in) and...

/etc/init.d/sshd reload

...and I can tunnel again. I wonder why this ever worked with retries at
2 before? Dunno... it's an FM.

Keith, with more information ...

Denyhosts is a tool that adds IP addresses to /etc/hosts.deny when
there are too many failed ssh attempts.  I run it, it is very useful
to stop system cracking attempts, but occasionally it will catch
fumble-fingered goodguys too.  If you have denyhosts installed (and
you should if you have public-facing ssh) to use a text editor remove
the non-offending IP address from both /etc/hosts and various files
in /usr/share/denyhosts/data/*.  You should also *add* the non-offending
IP to the /usr/share/denyhosts/data/allowed-hosts file, so the lockout
does not re-occur.

Or else, u shud nevre mayk tiepeng musteakz.

A quickie - if you enter a UPS tracking number ( 1Znnn...) into the

need to go to the UPS website and jump through hoops.

The same Google search trick also works for FedEx tracking numbers

It's very handy, I never go through the FedEx or UPS websites and now 
the USPS website as the same trick also works for USPS tracking numbers.

I have been experimenting with the MoinMoin wiki, and have a heap of
content (including the PLUG Library card catalog) ready to go live 
on the PLUG server, as soon as Wil can find the time to work on it.

We have a choice to make for the wiki, concerning secure write access
versus frequent deletion of wikispam.  We can make write access to
the wiki controlled by an Apache password or some other means, so that
only "approved" people can write to it.  That violates the spirit of
wiki, though.  Or we can open it up to anyone who wishes to sign up,
and actively clean out the wikispam that inevitably appears.  That 
will involve many of us spending actual clock time checking "recent
changes" and reverting spammed pages, and turning off user accounts
that get abused for spam.  

I would prefer an open wiki, but only if enough individuals volunteer
to help with cleanup.  If you wish to volunteer, let us all know.
Ultimately, the decision is Wil's, but if we demonstrate our willingness
to properly care for our new toy, it should be a favorable one.

Keith,

   Could access be limited to valid subscribers of the mail list? Would that
accomplish both goals (let all PLUGgers write on it and control spam) and
make access control easy since the wiki list can be regularly updated from
the mail list.

Last time I checked, '-' and '.' weren't shell metacharacters or control

There are automated ways to help reduce wiki spam. I know that Personal
Telco's wiki is pretty tight due to a lot of automation set up by one of our
volunteers. I don't know all of the details off of the top of my head but I
do know that WikiMinion is part of it..

http://www.nooranch.com/synaesmedia/wiki/wiki.cgi?WikiMinion

Also, MoinMoin's BadContent page (don't know much about it officially, check
this out)

http://wiki.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/BadContent

I would hate to see PLUG put out a wiki that's locked down only to list
subscribers or even worse  apache passwords..  Might as well just document
things on static webpages if you're going to do that.

It is a concern, but on my wiki I require creating an account and also
implement the BadContent stuff that Aaron mentioned, using the global
blacklist described here:
http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/AntiSpamGlobalSolution

It's a little sub-optimal because it causes saves to take longer than
necessary and on occasion time-out, but it has so far prevented all
spam.

I would recommend Pacific Solutions off of powell and
51st.  They are great.  If they cant fix it, they can
send you to the folks that can, locally.  I THINK they
refer folks to CTL for difficult repairs, they are
local to pdx.

   The same place I recommend to everyone who asks: Northwest Computer
Support in Beaverton. They've done outstanding work for me on laptops and
notebooks over the years, and repair is all they do.

If your friend is on a budget, and if they are willing to repair a T22 they
likely are, check ebay for parts laptops as well. Getting "new" parts for a
machine of that age can be costly or time consuming. I've done laptop
repairs for years and it's generally pretty easy to find partially broken
"parts laptops" of that era for under $50 shipped that have what you need to
get things working again. Then again, a complete working system can likely
be found for about $200...

   However, caveat emptor! I found a replacement LCD screen inverter for out
ThinkPad 600E via the web, from a store that specializes in replacement
parts. They sent me two of them, and told me to keep the second when I
called. When I brought the parts to NCS, it turned out that both were bad
and I ended up buying a new one (along with the LCD panel itself.) Couldn't
get a refund from the original vendor.

   If you want to keep the unit because it meets your needs, paying a bit
more for new parts can easily be justified. That written, I did replace the
keyboard on the 600E myself -- with a new one. This machine is perfectly
suited for purpose with maximum RAM (298M), a 70G/10K rpm hard drive, and
the replacement parts I've installed over the years.

For that matter, the new Asus linux laptop should be
out next month or so, and is supposed to retail
between 200.00 and 370.00 depending on the size of the
flash based hard drive in it.

The Asus EEE is a very different sort of laptop; depending on the user's
needs, it may or may not be sufficient--it has a 7" screen is a several
hundred Hz CPU--it's more like an oversized PDA than laptop.

Before spending a lot of money on it, it would be worthwhile to check
out the CMOS battery. I struggled with a friend's i-Series ThinkPad that
would not boot for a while and eventually gave up on it; I have since
heard that the odd symptoms I saw could have been caused by that.

Will it boot from a bootable cd and if it does, it might just need a
new hard disk which is easy to replace.

Of course the usual warnings about Ebay apply. Personally, I've had more
good luck than bad. I've found that dealing with individuals who have
(relatively) few transactions but consistently good reports are best. The
"Megasellers" can easily game the system with the volume they do, making
themselves appear much more trustworthy than they actually are.

You have a 10K RPM HDD in a laptop? Wha?

   Oops! Make that a 7200 RPM drive replacing the 5400 RPM drive that was in
there. My error.

   Maxing the memory available and putting in a faster hard drive has greatly
improved the responsiveness of a machine containing what is now considered a
rather slow 400MHz PII CPU.

   Sorry that I got you so excited, Quentin. :-)

Yes, I see them as well. I've already bid on one.
I can use more than one. I asked on the PLUG list
because I like to "Shop Oregon First".

If you strike out w/ the 678 and a PCI card is a possible option, I've heard
people have had good luck with Sangoma S518, and at $130 new, it's not much
more (sometimes less) than what 678's are going for lately.

It may be that quota is reporting usage in 512-byte blocks. Check this
by comparing with output from du -ms on /dev/sdb1.

Also try to find that other file that you own in /var/spool/mail.

This is an _excellent_ suggestion, Quentin. One of my main
reasons for going with the Cisco 678 is that I want to be
able to monitor its status and automate fault recovery. It's
all but impossible to do this with the other "built for
Windows", brain-dead DSL modems. The Sangoma product appears
to give me the ultimate in status monitoring and a company
that has a real Linux commitment.

The Goodwill on Grand in SE Portland always has two or three on the

I thought you had gotten one.  I think I have one. (Might be a 675.)  I 
will have to check when I get home.

Hey there,

I was wondering if you reached resolution on this matter.  I'm running a
Toshiba with the same specs and have been having the same problem.  Was
it the wireless?  I would find that interesting, because I rarely use
wireless and have left it off since testing to make sure it worked at
the fresh install.

Many thanks,

Andrew
Stellman <http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2454> and Jennifer
Greene<http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2455>talk through the ways
that software projects fail, using the signature humor
and insight in the acclaimed "Head First" series. There's an old saying:
"There's only one way to succeed, but a million ways to fail." But that
saying just isn't true when it comes to software projects. As it turns out,
there are a small number of ways that projects fail, and they'll sound
eerily familiar to any project manager, software engineer or programmer
who's been around for more than a few years. Many software projects that
started out as a small, stopgap utility turn into raging behemoths, sucking
seemingly unlimited time from your programmers. Or the president of your
company announced that your project will be done this week, even though you
know that i t still has an enormous number of bugs. Or your team delivered
the software, only to have users complain that an entire feature is missing.
Or every time the team fixes a bug, they seem to uncover a dozen
more?including ones that you know were fixed six months ago. Once you know
how projects fail, you can do what you need to do to keep them on track.

*Ignite Boston 2! September 6* <http://www.oreillynet.com/ignite/blog/>
Attention all New Englanders?-here's a heads-up that we're having a second
Ignite Boston on Thursday, September 6, from 6 to 10pm at Hurricane
O'Reillys. Yes that's right, Hurricane O'Reillys at 150 Canal St, Boston,
MA. No, it's not Tim's office after FOO Camp. We've picked a venue that is
more acoustically-oriented and should allow everyone to hear what's going
on. And we are planning to mix-up the format a little. There will be some
short "launches," followed by lightening talks, and a couple of other ideas.

*What is O'Reilly Editor Andy Oram Up to These Days?*
Andy continues his research into the free documentation written by users.
Recent articles on the topic include Why Do People Write Free
Documentation?<http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2007/06/14/why-do-people-write-free-documentation-results-of-a-survey.html>which
analyzes the results of an O'Reilly survey answered by over 350
respondents, and How to Help Mailing Lists Help
Readers<http://praxagora.com/andyo/professional/mailing_list_follow_up/>which
finds interesting results concerning how many questions get answered
on mailing lists and how long the list members spend on questions. Andy
presented his results at the July 2007 Open Source convention in Portland,
OR. For more information or to read Andy's articles, go to

[image: Hawk]*Cookin' with Ruby on
Rails*<http://www.oreillynet.com/topic/ruby.csp>
Bill Walton, well known for his "Rolling with Ruby on Rails Revisited"
tutorials, is back with a new series that takes Rails to the next level.

*Introduction to Flex Using
PHP*<http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2007/07/19/introduction-to-flex-using-php.html>
Flex is Adobe's next-generation platform of deploying browser-based
applications. Jack Herrington provides us with an introduction to Flex, by

*Mono: A Progress
Report*<http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2007/08/09/mono-a-progress-report.html>
Mono has always been a bit of an outsider. Open source folks distrust it
because it helps people use Microsoft technologies on non-Microsoft
platforms. Microsoft people don't see the need for it. But this social
outcast has been making steady progress and can offer a lot if you take the
time to check it out. Edd Dumbill gives us an update on the state of Mono.

users. In this podcast, Joe Schorr tells you how to use some of these new

*Thinking Camera, Lens, Lightroom before taking the shot--George Mann's Blog
*<http://www.oreillynet.com/digitalmedia/blog/2007/08/thinking_camera_lens_lightroom.html>
When I saw this scene in front of me, I realized that it was going to be
very difficult to get what I was seeing. For one it was very dark and I was
standing on a very narrow and slippery ledge between the lichen encrusted
ruins of Banteay Kdei (Angkor, Cambodia) and the jungle. I didn't have a
tripod with me but it was doubtful that I could have gotten the angle I was
after even if I had one anyway (where is that Gitzo ladder tripod when you
really need one).

*Highlight and Shadow Recovery in Harsh Light--Derrick Story's
Blog*<http://www.oreillynet.com/digitalmedia/blog/2007/08/highlight_and_shadow_recovery.html>
Nothing like a midday August wedding to strike fear into the heart of this
digital photographer. Harsh sun, sparse shade, black suits, white gowns,
black skin, white skin ? often all in the same shot. This is a situation
where you have to shoot Raw and thank goodness for the Highlight and Shadow
recovery sliders in Aperture. I have lots of tricks for dealing with bad
lighting (find shade whenever possible, fill flash, reflectors, etc.), but
as you know, sometimes clients say, "We don't have time to walk over there;
let's just take the shot here." Horror. "Not here!" I think. "This is the
last place on the planet I want to take this shot."

*Microformats: More Meaning from your
Markup*<http://www.sitepoint.com/article/microformats-meaning-markup>
Hidden on many pages of the Web are tiny packets of information -- people,
places, events, and more. You and I can read them, but they're invisible to
machines. Imagine the possibilities if that information became visible to
other sites and applications! In this article, Brian shows how the addition
of microformats to your web site markup can open up a whole new raft of
possibilities.
