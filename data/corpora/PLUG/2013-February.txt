Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

Who: Diane Petersen
What: Medical Informatics
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, February 7th, 2013 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of liberating technologies.

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg


Historically, implementation of electronic health records in medical 
offices have been problematic. Specifically, poor implementation of 
these products is the leading cause of failure of acceptance of EHRs in 
these offices. Implementation of EHRs in the small physician office 
remains poorly documented and this contributes to this failure rate. To 
address this need, OEMR (The OpenEMR Non-Profit) developed an internship 
experience with the Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical 
Epidemiology at Oregon Health and Science University to develop a road 
map for converting a small physician's office that is still using paper 
records to OpenEMR, an open source electronic health record, while using 
open source tools to implement and document the transformation. 
Documentation was made public on the OEMR wiki (at 
http://www.oemr.org/wiki/Going_From_Paper_to_Electronic) as a template 
for future implementations. This presentation is an overview of the 
documentation completed for the wiki. There are many paths to 
implementation, but the destination is meaningful use of the OpenEMR system.

Special Thanks: PLUG regular Keith Lofstrom was instrumental to the 
success of this project, not to mention Dr. Sam Bowen, MD in North 
Carolina and PLUG speaker Tony McCormick.

Diane Petersen is an emerging clinical informaticist, drawing from her 
formal education in clinical informatics and her extensive experience as 
a clinical pharmacist in a variety of settings. Having completed an 
internship leading and documenting the implementation of OpenEMR, an 
open source ambulatory electronic health record and practice management 
software application, Diane is in her last term of the Masters of 
Biomedical Informatics program at Oregon Health and Science University. 
She plans to apply her background and knowledge contributing to the 
improvement of managing healthcare data, and ultimately the improvement 
of patient care and outcomes.

According to a recent RAND Corp. study, the efficiency gains hoped for with
EMRs have been stifled due to the incompatibilities between different
systems.

Do you see a link to the RAND story? I can't find one. Otherwise, they 
aren't saying anything substantial.

Message-ID: <510C67A2.9040502@comcast.net>

Update: After finishing the previous e-mail I turned to the Dell and saw 
that the screen had gone blank. Out of habit I moved the mouse and 
discovered that it was active and I had a mouse pointer on the screen. 
The list of error messages was still there. I hit <ENTER> and Ubuntu 
12.04 booted up. I logged in. The update manager has 500 updates, which 
it is now installing. I'll see what happens after that, but I wonder if 
that will fix the boot problem.

Subject: [PLUG] serial 18250: too much work for irq17
Message-ID: <510C6F74.10007@comcast.net>

(This is odd. The update I sent after sending this made it through to 
the list, but this didn't.)

I just installed Ubuntu 12.07 on a Dell Dimension 2400. Before the 
install I replaced the single stick of 512 MB DDR 333 with two sticks of 
1 GB DDR 333 that I picked up at Free Geek, yesterday. A few days 
earlier I tried to run the live CD, but it didn't seem to like having 
only 512 MB -- at least that's what I thought. I don't know if a dirty 
DVD drive might have affected things, though.

Anyway, my first attempt failed partway through due to the DVD drive 
being unable to read the CD. I disconnected the first DVD drive, 
connected the cable to the second drive and tried again. This time the 
install mostly completed. But, when I pulled out the CD and hit <ENTER> 
nothing happened for several minutes. Then I got an error message that said:

     Alert! /dev/disk/by-uuid/82df63b6-8b97-4287-ae1b-db29565f5370 does 
not exist.

and I was dropped into the ash shell. Typing exit for some reason 
allowed the system to finish booting. However, the next attempt to boot 
didn't do anything, not even the above error message. I powered down 
again, powered back up, pressed F12 to get a boot menu, chose 7, "Boot 
to a utility partition" (or words to that effect). I got the GRUB menu 
and chose the first option. I got the above Alert! error, again. This 
time, when I typed exit, I got 23 lines of a new error message, each one 
with a different number inside the brackets:


[ 235.928013] serial 18250: too much work for irq17
[ 238.580018] serial 18250: too much work for irq17
[ 238.596019] serial 18250: too much work for irq17
<...>
[ 250.216172] serial 18250: too much work for irq17

Internet searching turned up that error message several times, all with 
different solutions that did or did not work for those posting.

Could this be related to the card providing SATA support for the single 
hard drive? There is a 160 GB SATA drive hanging on that card.

One of the search results said that by removing the telephone modem card 
the problem went away. Replies to that post said it didn't work for 
them. I'll give this a try, since I don't have a need for the modem 
card, but it sounds dubious.

Any thoughts?

Thanks.

Subject: [PLUG] If YouTube quit working in Chrome for you
Message-ID: <20130202152759.GA17726@jamhome.us>

Here's the issue and workaround:

    Which version of Chrome? What is your CPU? IIRC, Pepper Flash is disabled, by default, on older CPUs. 

    Very, very similar thread here: Google Chrome - couldn't load plugin - shockwave flash and a link to
    code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=173790. It's still flagged as "unconfirmed" despite several me-toos.
        
    It's now "untriaged" but this comment explains the problem: "Unfortunately, 11.5.31.138 was pushed out via the component
    updater, and using plugins from the component updater doesn't work on Linux (and breaks stuff, due to the way plugins
    are loaded). :( So deleting ~/.config/google-chrome/PepperFlash should fix things (unfortunately falling back to .137)
    ... and since we've stopped pushing .138, it won't reappear." 

So if your YouTube / flashcontent is broken  rm -rf ~/.config/google-chrome/PepperFlash 
will restore your video access.

The noted rm -rf worked for me -- I found the thread yesterday afternoon
when I couldn't open a simple puzzle that I wanted to do after work --
(where I'm now testing and documenting the open source implementation of
SSO, now OpenAM).

Thanks,
Mike

Turns out the problem was just outside the box. If I bend the power cord 
at the point where it plugs into the power supply power will be 
interrupted, or restored, depending on which way the cord is bent. Good 
thing I have a box full of power cords.

Message-ID: <CA+MfPqu0cQMKdVrocv1Gd0n-ZmbWdrM4N-RjVPVcJyofY-mGJA@mail.gmail.com>

I have an Acer Aspire netbook running Ubuntu 12.04-32 bit, and the
internal wireless network adapter has gone intermittent.  I will be
traveling soon and decided to go ahead and get a USB adapter with long
range capabilities instead of replacing the internal one.  I have done
research, primarily on the Alfa units.  It seems I should be looking
at chipset and compatibility with my kernel version.  It looks like
these units are using a variety of Realtek, Ralink, and Atheros sets.
Linux drivers are incredibly hard to find.  I'm coming up on Google
with vague "it sort of works but your have to?" over things I cannot
understand.

I'd like to see if anyone is using a unit that works under the Ubuntu
12.04 kernel.  Brand is unimportant, but it has to be available in the
marketplace.  A recommendation would save me headaches of buying
something that does not work.  I don't need full monitoring capability
or the ability to use tools to hack networks.  I just want to find
available weak/distant free open wifi any hour of every day, and not
just when my internal unit decides to function.  802.11n would be
really nice but I will take what I can get.  Selling one?  Even
better.

That is EXACTLY why OpenEMR (and Diane's presentation) is so
important to open source and our community.  The people at
the meeting Thursday night can change the world.  Bring
your doctor with you.  I'm bringing two doctors!


While compatability IS a problem, the specifics vary between 
regions and practices.  Portland is dominated by Providence,
Legacy, Kaiser, OHSU, and Adventist.  All these organizations
use EPIC (http://www.epic.com/) and spend tens of millions of
dollars a year on configuration, training, and support. 

And, surprisingly, all these big EPIC systems do NOT
interchange data.  A Portland doctor can use the Providence
EPIC web portal to look at any Providence patient's data
from Alaska to northern California, but they cannot combine
that data with data from Legacy, if the same patient went to
Legacy for an emergency room visit, an X-Ray, or a lab test.

Medium-sized primary care organizations ( i.e. Portland Clinic)
also use EPIC.  Small clinics (1 to 20 doctors) use many different
EMRs, some "free on the web", some purchased at great expense,
etc.  And as you say, interchange of "live" data between these
EMRs doesn't happen - at best, data is moved as unstructured
text or images.

Many small clinics do NOT use EMR, because they can be a
P.I.T.A., enforcing "one size fits all" operating procedures,
often incompatable with the unique way many doctors practice
For good reasons - patients are unique, too.

More importantly, many practices have been bankrupted when
the proprietary vendors jacked up their prices, with patient
data inaccessable in proprietary formats and not migratable
to other EMRs.  To many vendors, anti-interoperable design
is a monopolistic feature, not a bug.

That does not mean no interchange happens.  Some of the EPIC
systems allow doctors to "print to file", which they can save
in their own EMR's.  However, that is complicated, and it is not
"structured data", meaning that only humans and not algorithms
can search the interchanged data.  However, if the images are
digitized, then someday machine can parse them - as opposed to
handwritten notes, phone slips, etc. in a fat manila envelope.

And someday, that historical data from 10 or 30 years ago will
be vital to new kinds of treatment.  A chicken and egg problem:
developing history-based treatments requires detailed history,
and there's little justification for maintaining the detailed
history without those treatments.

The interchange is improving.  Legacy has a "small practice
IT outreach" staff working hard to make their structured data
interchange with other EMRs.  The manager is interested in
working with us for OpenEMR interchange.  It helps A LOT
when the target EMR is open source.  This may work out like
the reverse engineering Andrew Tridgell did that resulted
in Samba accessing SMB, and Git replacing Bitkeeper. 

So - all the reasons that we love free software, and that
Portland is a great place to do it, are also the reasons we
should extend free software into medical informatics here in
our community, creating new businesses and keeping ourselves
and our neighbors alive.  This could be the NEXT BIG THING,
and if local doctors and software people work together, we
could make Portland the global hub for medical informatics.

You choose - professional success and personal longevity,
or paying monopolists for bad software and bad medicine?
If your career and life matter to you, show up Thursday,
and bring your doctor with you.

Keith

I doubt I can bring any doctors, but would it be possible/practical to
have a video of the talk for distribution to a doctor or two?

I've installed one of these for a couple of friends and both worked out 
of the box.  A another friend recommended it and likes it so much he has 
had extras on hand that I've bought from him.
    One install was for Windows Vista machine and the CD had the driver 
(if that interests anyone.)

Signal-wise it far exceeded my ASUS Netbook's wireless.  I saw about 3 
to 4 times as many access points around my house with it.

   If a video is made I would like to share it with my primary physician.
They're on their second digital system in a couple of years and the data are
not transferable from the old to the new.

I've been using an Alfa long range wifi unit on Mint KDE for a few years ,
& it works very well.  My Alfa is model # AWUS036H.  It has the Realtek
8187 chipset.  I don't use Ubuntu, so I don't know how well it will work
with that distro.  A lot of my friends have used Ubuntu with their Alfas of
various chpsets & models, and they've had good results.

cheers,

Elcaset

I did drop a line to Nate DeNiro who would be the likely candidate and I 
believe filmed Tony McCormick's talk.

Note to self: call him...

I sent an email with a pdf attachment from a Gmail account to

The particular pdf has been sent to many others without problems.

Does Gmail handle attachments in some unique self-serving way?

gmail now supports sending attachments both as conventional attachments,

Subject: [PLUG] Booting Linux kernel as EFI Stub on Macintosh Family
Message-ID: <510EF7BF.4000306@intel.com>

Hello,

I have managed to obtain a working configuration to boot Linux on a 
MacBook via grub-efi. I have documented that project here: 
http://nosemaj.org/dual-boot-mac-linux .

Next, I would like to remove grub-efi all together, and directly boot 
the kernel as an EFI stub.

Has anyone had success in doing this, or would be able to offer guidance 
towards a working solution?

The (stock) Ubuntu 12.10 kernel that I am targeting appears to ship with 
all necessary CONFIG_EFI*=y. I have reviewed documentation from the 
Kernel <http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/x86/efi-stub.txt>, 
and from Arch Linux 
<https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/UEFI_Bootloaders#Booting_EFISTUB>, 
and am trying to bridge the gap.

Thank you,
Jameson

Message-ID: <CAC+jgt-g+wO_iL=H5_gT9zHoMOpK=oSw9YhtOVVTQtEyKKKHzA@mail.gmail.com>

My friend lives on the river. On one side is a house that can't get
cable internet, and lost even basic wired phone service (barely worked
for years, went out completely for area during a flood). My friend has
been getting by on a cellular data widget, but it's only good for
email and service is flaky. 2000ft away across the river is another
friend's house and business, with wicked-fast unlimited internet.

I'd like to think a pair of linux raspberry pi's with the right
config, maybe tied to a pair of alfa usb-wifi devices with directional
antennas could make this perpetual run-around with the
lack-of-service-providers go away and bring the modern world to the
river house, but I'm only passingly familiar with the elements
involved.

Is this a viable start? Am I even looking at the right gear? Is there
any simpler way to make a rock-solid internet bridge?

Ideally the setup would be to just a pair of headless boxes, plug in
power and ethernet on both ends, and have it act as a long cable,
letting the desktop computer on one end get DHCP service from existing
router at other end.

I happen to have a pair of unused pi's, anything else I would have to
buy anyway, I'm wide open to any suggestions if you have experience
doing this kind of function with different gear.

Raspberry pi's don't have wifi.  Get two ubiquiti nanostation m2hp's,
or a couple bullet m2hp's with directional antennas.  Point them at
each other.  That's assuming you have line-of-sight.  If there are any
obstacles, you can use loco m9's, which cut through better at 900 MHz.

If you want help, let me know.

If you can see line of site I'd go with a couple 2400 MHz Loco's I've
done 3 installs
and have no complaints. The only thing I have done is put a
polyethylene cover over
the units.

The only issue I can think of is when a boat goes by. If you put them
10-15 feet up
that should take care of the little pleasure craft. But would only do
that if there is
something else to attract lightning.

There's a wealth of information out there on building
directional WiFi antennas.  Take a look at

http://www.turnpoint.net/wireless/cantennahowto.html

and also just Google for "cantenna".  Here's a review
of a commercial version ($50) that indicates some
success at 1.2 miles (over 6000 feet):

suggestion on using a cantenna as a feed horn for a
satellite dish reflector.

I'd recommend not not buying antennas from ordinary retail outlets,
they'll sell anything that looks good in a shrinkwrapped box.  Look
here instead:

  http://www.invictuswireless.com/category_s/2.htm

These are decent, and not expensive, we've used them before:

  http://www.invictuswireless.com/H_D_Die_Cast_24dBi_2_4GHz_Parabolic_Grid_Antenna_p/dc24-24.htm
  http://www.invictuswireless.com/24_19P_p/24-19p.htm

I saw some cheaper ones in there as well.  The ubiquiti bullets will
screw directly onto a female N-connector.  It's good to seal the
connectors too.

If you really are out in the middle of nowhere, you won't have a lot
of other transmitters to compete with.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

Who: Diane Petersen
What: Medical Informatics
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, February 7th, 2013 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of liberating technologies.

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg


Historically, implementation of electronic health records in medical 
offices have been problematic. Specifically, poor implementation of 
these products is the leading cause of failure of acceptance of EHRs in 
these offices. Implementation of EHRs in the small physician office 
remains poorly documented and this contributes to this failure rate. To 
address this need, OEMR (The OpenEMR Non-Profit) developed an internship 
experience with the Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical 
Epidemiology at Oregon Health and Science University to develop a road 
map for converting a small physician's office that is still using paper 
records to OpenEMR, an open source electronic health record, while using 
open source tools to implement and document the transformation. 
Documentation was made public on the OEMR wiki (at 
http://www.oemr.org/wiki/Going_From_Paper_to_Electronic) as a template 
for future implementations. This presentation is an overview of the 
documentation completed for the wiki. There are many paths to 
implementation, but the destination is meaningful use of the OpenEMR system.

Special Thanks: PLUG regular Keith Lofstrom was instrumental to the 
success of this project, not to mention Dr. Sam Bowen, MD in North 
Carolina and PLUG speaker Tony McCormick.

Diane Petersen is an emerging clinical informaticist, drawing from her 
formal education in clinical informatics and her extensive experience as 
a clinical pharmacist in a variety of settings. Having completed an 
internship leading and documenting the implementation of OpenEMR, an 
open source ambulatory electronic health record and practice management 
software application, Diane is in her last term of the Masters of 
Biomedical Informatics program at Oregon Health and Science University. 
She plans to apply her background and knowledge contributing to the 
improvement of managing healthcare data, and ultimately the improvement 
of patient care and outcomes.

On Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS, I entered the command "man random" in order to
examine the range of the random number generator.  Unfortunately this
command does NOT reveal what the MAX_RAND setting is.

My system is 64 bit OS. Can I assume that MAX_RAND = 2^64-1 ??

There is some clarification for MAX_RAND that is needed.

Looks like it's hard-coded to 2**32/2-1.

Message-ID: <489365147.1007444.1360366884586.JavaMail.root@sz0130a.emeryville.ca.mail.comcast.net>

Still working on getting programs that run on Ubuntu 10.04 to run on
  12.04.

  

  Today's exercise is trying to get the python program footpedal to
  work. I am able to install the .deb with the Ubuntu Software Center.
  When I click on it's entry in
  
  Applications >
  System Tools > Preferences I hear some disk accessing but nothing
  happens that I can see. What I'm used to happening is that an icon
  appears at the top of the screen that allows me to configure the
  tool.

  

  I first tried installing the same .deb file I use in 10.04. I
  thought that maybe I need to get the source and install from that,
  so I downloaded it via svn and ran the shell script
  
  make_binary_package.sh. It appeared to run to completion. It created
  a new footpedal_0.5_0buntu1_all.deb and then installed it. However I
  still get the same results as above.

  

  Next I wondered if I was supposed to uninstall the earlier version
  first. That was version 0.4. Since I installed it using the Ubuntu
  Software Center I thought that's where I should go to uninstall it.
  However the only option provided is reinstall.

  

  Next I wondered just what program is being called from Applications
  >
  System Tools > Preferences. How does one go about finding out
  that information? I have the menu editor Main Menu installed, but it
  does not show the path to the program in its properties. All it says
  is:

  

  Type: Application

  Name: Footpedal Utility

  Command: footpedal

  Comment: Footpedal configuration panel

  

  That's the same information Main Menu shows for the version
  installed on my 10.04 machine. 

  

  Another question is what log do I look in to see what happened when
  I clicked on that menu item?

  

  Thanks.

  
  
  

Regards,

Dick Steffens

Try running it from a shell window, and see what sort of error
messages are produced.  Since footpedal is a python program, you
may need to do something like

    $ python /path/to/footpedal.py

Or not, if footpedal is a shell script that executes the actual
python program.

Probably ~/.xsession-errors.  You might look in /var/log/messages
as well.  Also, doesn't Ubuntu use AppArmor?  I know next to
nothing about AppArmor, but if it were preventing your program
from running, I would imagine that it logged that event somewhere.
I've no idea where, though.

I'm afraid that's all I can think of.  Maybe some of the more
'buntu-oriented folks will chime in with better ideas.

Thanks. That's a start. Now I just have to figure out what all that

that's my next line of research.

I went looking for that and found that it doesn't exist. That seemed 
odd, so I Googled it and found out that Ubuntu uses syslog, instead. 
Screwy, but there it is. Anyway, there wasn't anything in 
/var/log/syslog related to the problem.

I don't know anything about AppArmor, either. But it appears that the 
problem exists with:

AttributeError: 'pynotify.Notification' object has no attribute 
'attach_to_status_icon'

Thanks. It's something to start with.

Progress! Thanks. I still don't have any visual indication that the 
program has loaded, and I don't have the configuration icon. Maybe it's 
something to do with this being Gnome Classic instead of what's in 
10.04. Anyway, the designer of this program had multiple uses in mind 
for the foot pedal and built in several actions that could occur 
depending on the settings in the configuration window. Unfortunately, 
Rew, Play, Fast Forward were not his choice for the defaults. I can see 
something in the source code that assigns actions to a set of variables. 
Now I need to find where they are first set and change the defaults.

Thanks again. This is moving me in the right direction.

Subject: [PLUG] Can one add an OS on a second drive to GRUB
Message-ID: <511A7CA8.1000602@comcast.net>

In my "new" machine I have a disk with both XP and 64 bit Ubuntu 12.04. 
I have a second disk with 32 bit Ubuntu 12.04. So far I have swapped 
cables when I wanted to do something with the 32 bit version. Is it 
possible to have both drives plugged in at the same time and have GRUB 
give me the option of which of the three OS's to boot?

If it matters, these are both SATA drives.

Hi

I have linux on two different drives.

I go into bios on power on and move the drive to the top of the order.
 So now it boots from sdc or swap the order and it boots from sdd..

It would be easier to put both in grub.

YMMV

Sure. If you're using (legacy) Grub, you'll need to add an entry in 
/boot/grub/device.lst for the additional device, and the appropriate 
entries in /boot/grub/menu.lst. Here is a sample device.map:

device.map:

(hd0) /dev/sda
(hd1) /dev/sdb

The (hd0) entry will already be there, an I added (hd1).

Then just copy the relevant entry from the menu.lst file on your second 
disk into /boot/grub/menu.lst on your first disk, but change the hd0 
entries to hd1. Here's one of mine, showing both the existing (hd0) 
entry, and the new (hd1) entry:

title Desktop -- openSUSE 12.1 - 3.1.10-1.16 - hd0
root (hd0,0)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-3.1.10-1.16-desktop root=/dev/md1 resume=/dev/md2 
splash=silent showopts init=/sbin/sysvinit ipv6.disable=1 vga=0x31a
initrd /boot/initrd-3.1.10-1.16-desktop

title Desktop -- openSUSE 12.1 - 3.1.10-1.16 - hd1
root (hd1,0)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-3.1.10-1.16-desktop root=/dev/md1 resume=/dev/md2 
splash=silent showopts init=/sbin/sysvinit ipv6.disable=1 vga=0x31a 
ipv4only=1
initrd /boot/initrd-3.1.10-1.16-desktop

In my case they're both the same kernel, devices, etc., but they could 
just as easily be drastically different (even Linux and Windows).

---

If you're using GRUB2, boot up with both disks plugged in, and run 
update-grub2. It should discover that the second disk is bootable (too), 
and add it to the menu. Here's an example:

# update-grub2
Generating grub.cfg ...
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-37-generic
Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-37-generic
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-36-generic
Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-36-generic
Found memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.bin
Found Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS (12.04) on /dev/sda2
Found Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS (12.04) on /dev/sdb2
done
#

Notice that in addition to the primary image (which in my case is an 
RAID device), it also found bootable systems on both /dev/sda2 and 
/dev/sdb2. In my case those are really the mirror images from the RAID, 
but they wouldn't need to be.

Good luck.

Yes, it can be done. Most likely running "sudo update-grub" will allow it
to autoconfigure the grub settings to give you the options of which OS to
boot.

You could also check out

you need a GUI.

The short answer is, Yes. The slightly longer answer is, it is
complex, but the fact that both drives are SATA drives makes it
straightforward, more or less depending on how your motherboard BIOS
assigns the drives.

You can add an entry to /boot/grub/menu.lst on your primary hard
drive, pointing to the alternative OS on your secondary hard drive.

Hint: Code the root(hd?,?) and configfile /boot/grub/menu.lst entries.

The good news is that you can play around to make this work as long as
you don't change more than one thing at a time and test it thoroughly.

If you get carried away with wanting to boot multiple systems, on more
than two drives, perhaps including both SATA and SCSI disks, you might
need a rescue Live CD to straighten things out after you screw them up.

I've been there, done that. I revisit it about once a year when I take
the time to install new releases, having forgotten how much pain it is
in the meantime. I've slowed down and one of these years I might learn.

I have four hard drives in my desktop system, two 80GB SATA drives and
two 9GB SCSI drives, and have a different system on each one of these.
In addition, I use logical partitions for all of these systems. You do
not want to see the GRUB menu.lst files for this awkward configuration.

HTH,
Robert

Very simple, very easy. I got essentially what you described. I now can 
choose to boot either the 32 bit or the 64 bit versions of Ubuntu 12.04, 
or XP.

Thanks, Brian.

Message-ID: <511BCEFA.8090107@comcast.net>

Upgrades sure are annoying.

I've migrated to my Ubuntu 12.04 (32 bit) machine. I'm diving into a 
real project this morning. The first thing I need to do is to set a 
header to a Word doc with the name of the file rendered in Arial 9pt 
bold italic. I've been doing this for months. I copy the file name, past 
it into the header of the Word doc (using LibreOffice Writer, of 
course), select what I just pasted, right click on it and pick Arial 
from the list of available fonts. This worked fine in LibreOffice Writer 
on Ubuntu 10.04. But Arial is not on the list. I checked to be sure that 
msttcorefonts is installed. And, actually, Arial is present already in 
the template Word doc file. I can type Arial into the font selection box 
in the LibreOffice Writer tool bar, and it changes the font of the 
selection to Arial.

So, why isn't Arial listed as a font option? Times New Roman isn't 
there, either, although it's present in the template file.

I think you need to install the "Microsoft" true type fonts, which aren't
installed by default.

If I remember correctly, the following command will start the process:
    sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer

Mine are installed in
    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/

so I'd check to see if they are located in there.  If they are, maybe you
can run something to "fix" the fonts.

Check the following man pages:
    mkfontscale
    mkfontdir
    fc-cache
to help you rebuild the files / listings.

There's only a README file that directory. It says:

--------------------------------------
License refused.

Please reinstall the ttf-mscorefonts-installer package (e.g. via
  apt-get install --reinstall ttf-mscorefonts-installer
to get prompted for the license again.
--------------------------------------

Sure enough, I get a dialog titled "Configuring 
ttf-mscorefonts-installer". It provides a EULA. At the bottom of the 
dialog there is a line with "<Ok>" in the center. However, hitting 
<ENTER> does nothing. In trying to get out of that I've corrupted 
something related to dpkg at /var/lib/dpkg -- something to do with a 
file called lock.

I'll have to work on that some more after lunch.

If I remember correctly, you need to TAB (or click on the OK button)
before hitting <Enter>.  But I'm not positive.  So try again with the
    sudo apt-get install --reinstall ttf-mscorefonts-installer

Curious to what people think the rates for long term and for short term are
in town.  Clearly there are ranges.  Also curious about general rates for
SMB consulting.  In Maui desktop support by the hour was in the $125 area
and servers and networking was easily $140.

Long term I have always estimated about 2-2.5 x base salary of the position
/ 1800-2000 hours a year.

Chris,

   For the past decade or so I've worked for a flat rate whenever a project
has a defined end point; e.g., preparation of a permit application,
environmental impact assessment, hydrologic modeling for flooding
prediction, analyzing surface water chemistry data for changes over time.
Only when the project has an indefinite term (e.g., expert witness in
litigation) do I charge by time and effort. There are many benefits to you
and your clients of working for a fixed fee.

   Remember, if your client had the skills and experience to do the project
you'd not be hired. Therefore, he has no idea how much time and effort are
required to deliver a project with which you are both satisfied. You
probably have an idea how much effort is involved, but that total dollar
amount can scare your client. Agreeing on a fixed fee means he knows in
advance what his cost is and he accepts it. And you are comfortable with
that amount, too.

   By working for a fixed fee you align yourself with your client's
interests: getting the desired results as quickly as is consistent with the
high quality on which your reputation is based. In my industry --
environmental consulting -- too many providers drag out a project to keep
the cash flowing in. Whether this is really the case, clients think that it
is and they don't like it. Put yourself in their shoes. Working for a fixed
fee sets you apart from the competition.

   Too often when working on a time-and-expense basis we under-bill the client
because getting the job done right takes a lot of time, and we know the
client will be bothered by a invoice for a large amount of money. So we
short-change ourselves (literally) or we risk really ticking off the client
by asking for a lot of money. A fixed fee eliminates this problem, even if
we would be working for minimum wage (or less) if we actually tracked the
time.

   Working on a fixed fee means you know just how much revenue you have. You
do not need to spend time entering the hours you worked (and writing a
justification for each entry) and you can focus on producing a high quality
product.

   If the project is long term (by your definition), write a retainer
agreement. This gives you a known amount of revenue each month regardless of
how much time you put in. You can define the term of the retainer agreement
at a mutually-agreed time (say, three months) with quarterly renewals upon
mutual consent. This gives your client both a known cost and a way out after
each period, and it gives you a known revenue and the same out if you
determine that the client should be fired. Yes, I've fired clients in the
past and I'm working now on two projects with monthly retainers and I like
that very much (despite the long hours I put in.)

   There's more of course, but this should get you thinking.

HTH,

Rich

You may want to consider open source fonts - no EULA, licenses, etc to 
deal with.  Don't forget: if you click YES to the EULA, you can legally 
bound to comply with the Microsoft font usage restrictions. Instead, 
Check out:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_fonts
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Libertine

and

http://www.openfontlibrary.org/

In Libreoffice, you can go to "TOOLS - OPTIONS" then Libreoffice - 
Fonts  to define a font substitution table.

You can also check out Bitstream Vera: 
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/ttf-bitstream-vera/1.10/
The DejaVa fonts shipped with most linux distros are derivatives of 
Vera:

You get want you pay for.  Would you rather have Ubuntu/Canonical sued

completely clear of all  proprietary non F/OSS software. Some is useful 
and provided with reasonable licensing (games, drivers, etc).  But I try 
to limit corporate intrusion if OSS alternatives are available.

That's my 2 cents.

I agree fix fee's make a lot of sense but I find it is harder for
the client to grasp for longer term work and maintenance   I also find that
if the project has many aspects outside of my control that it can be very
difficult to get scope of work tight enough.  Additionally understanding
placement within the market also comes down to cost per hour.

Rich's points are well made and sensible, but it's true--sometimes
things fly out of control.  I'll be honest--I undercharge for exactly
the reasons specified--fear of delivering a too-huge bill and pissing
someone off.  That said, for actual short-term, non-terrifying
projects, my rates work for me, though they are cheap (IMNSHO).

I have a sliding scale, and here's the criteria.  These criteria are
the most useful part of *my* reply, not the $ amounts associated.

i have 3 tiers, which you (as a client) fit into based on:

1) do i like working for you
2) do i like your technology

if no to both, you get charged the highest price - typically $100/hr
if yes to one, you  get the middle price - typically $80/hr
if yes to both, you get the low price - typically $60/hr

setting up samba for my dad?  $80  (love dad, hate windows-wrangling)
setting up an parallel processing cluster with free rein on setup for
an old colleague i love?  $60
going back to revisit the painful server debugging for that jerk?  $100

i make sure to have a (free) project-definition meeting with any
client (new or old) at the beginning of a project so i can assess the
situation before agreeing to a price.

i find the "sticker shock" is greatly ameliorated if you actually
track time--not in terms of "worked 234 hours" but like so:

project - result - time spent each day

this is especially helpful when shared constantly with client (i just
use a google spreadsheet and invite them on day 1).  "hey so after
today here's where we're at." at the end of every day (unless we're on
a longer-term thing in which case i still update the spreadsheet but
don't necessarily wave it under their nose each day).

i've never gotten pushback even when something spiralled dismally out
of control because they saw it happening in slo-mo.

luck++;

Its not a Ubuntu/Canonical issue we ship the source package for those fonts
as is so if their is a issue its upstream but you can file a bug and we
will look into it.

It has not been a very good week for upgrading my machines. Fortunately 
I still have a working 10.04 on my laptop and have been able to get work 
out. But, my old 10.04 desktop machine won't finish loading X, and I 
managed to bork something related to a lock file on this 12.04 machine 
while trying to reinstall the ttf-mscorefonts-installer. Here's what I 
get when I run that command, now:

rsteff at Gateway-E-4500D:~/Public$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall 
ttf-mscorefonts-installer
[sudo] password for rsteff:

E: Unable to lock directory /var/cache/apt/archives/
rsteff at Gateway-E-4500D:~/Public$

I'll try again after I power down the machine, but probably not until 
tomorrow. I still have some work to get out. And while I do the work on 
my laptop I still need to use this machine for a couple of things. Once 
that project is finished I'll give this another try.

Unfortunately open source fonts are not an option. The work I'm doing 
requires the use of template files that want specific fonts, so that's 
what I use.

Of course not. And I'm not against agreeing to a EULA from time to time. 
The problem this time is that the installation didn't work. I don't 
remember now whether I used the Ubuntu Software Center the first time I 
tried adding the MS core fonts or if I used the command line. But, when 
I tried the command to reinstall them the EULA dialog did not accept my 
attempt to accept the license.

My rant wasn't so much aimed at the font issue as it was at how several 
things no longer work, and I'm still not sure what change broke them. 
Two examples: I use a program called Transcribe and another called 
footpedal. These worked fine on 10.04. Transcribe works on 12.04, but 
footpedal does not. I have both of them loaded, so it's not total 
failure -- although it was total failure on the 64 bit version of 12.04. 
I tried things I found at each program's site, but haven't had time to 
work it all through. These programs are written in Python. But, are the 
problems with something in the Python code? Or are they related to 
Gnome? Are there significant differences between Gnome as used in 10.04, 
versus Gnome Classic? Or could it be some other subsystem I don't even 
know about? Sigh.

Ah, well. I have the weekend available, and there's the clinic on 
Sunday, too. Right?

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1302150815370.16311@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   If I correctly recall a message here from a couple of months ago there is
an alternative to whatismyip for automatically checking for a changed IP
address. I'm having much difficulty with this site and am stymied in my
attempts to get help there.

   A couple of days ago I started getting messages every 15 minutes that the
cron script checking whatismyip.com failed to get a new IP address. I
changed the time the script runs to every 2 hours since that is the new free
lookup limit (12/day). I still get the same script error message.

   Looking at the log I see that whatismyip.com dropped their .asp interface
(I'm guessing that's what it is). When I received the notice of their
changes a month or two ago I registered with them for the free account and
12 lookups per day so I don't know what's not working.

   On their web site I try logging in to their fora but my password is
constantly rejected. Since I recoreded that password this makes no sense. To
rub salt in my wound, trying to have them send me the password they have
also fails because, the message box saye, I've given them an e-mail address
not in their database. Yet, when I try to register again they tell me my
username and e-mail address are already in their system. Trying to contact
an adminstrator (their next suggestion) also fails because I need to enter
my username and password to send the admin a message asking why I cannot use
my username and password. Checkmate.

   Verizon seems to have slowed the frequency of IP address changes so every
2 hours should certainly be a sufficient interval to check. But,
whatismyip.com is no longer responding to the cron script nor allowing me to
ask anyone there what broke.

   Suggestions for alternatives are needed.

TIA,

Subject: [PLUG] Strange update manager behavior
Message-ID: <CAArUT0jrxOjA5bENd7LrurDt1RdbVfTk7NWKkrzp+--9UvHKpQ@mail.gmail.com>

I ran the update manager.  It did not request a password, and it proceeded
to download over 200M of data.  It hung up about 80% of the way through the
install process.  I had to shut down to get out of the lock.  On restarting
I ran the update manager again.  It said that I needed to run a partial
upgrade as the previous upgrade did not complete.  When I started the
partial upgrade it seemed like it was going to upgrade, not just an update.
 (I am running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and do not want to upgrade 'till 3 years
from now.)  So I canceled it.  Next, I started the update manager again,
and it said my system was up-to-date.

In the auth log I see COMMAND=/usr/bin/update-manager --dist-upgrade.  I
did not enter that command.  I cannot decipher other logs.

Any clues as to what happened, what the damage might be, and what needs to
be changed to prevent a recurrence?

Thanks,
-Denis

This is the new normal in 12.04. A password is still required to install 
something new, but not to update.

A similar thing happened to me on 10.04 this week. I am stuck in a 
situation where X did not fully load. I dropped into a terminal 
(<CTRL><<ALT><F1>) and logged in. I misread a line that told me I could 
upgrade to 12.04 and told it to go ahead. It started downloading all 
manner of stuff. Took a long time, too. When if finally surfaced again 
it was clearer that it wanted upgrade my 10.04 installation to 12.04, 
and could take a couple of hours or more to do so. I declined, and it 
spent another several minutes undoing itself from whatever it had done 
to get ready for the upgrade.

So, no, I don't have any clues as to what any damage might be. It also 
doesn't make sense for it to be doing an upgrade, unless somehow it was 
trying to take you from 12.04 to 12.10. And, no. I don't know how to 
prevent a recurrence.

Overnight between Thursday and Friday my Ubuntu 12.04 machine decided to 
reboot. Naturally, I didn't remember that GRUB picks the 64 bit version 
as the default, so that's what was running Friday morning. It took me a 
few minutes to realize that was why there was less on the desktop than 
the night before.

Once I rebooted to the 32 bit version of 12.04 I was able to get some 
work out the door. There remain several questions, but they are for 
different threads.

This morning the system wanted to do an update. I agreed to let it so 
do. One of the parts of the update involved the MS ttf installer. It 
presented a EULA dialog box that I was able to click in this time. Now 
the expected fonts are installed and available.

Still no idea just what happened, there, but at least it works.

Subject: [PLUG] Hung X
Message-ID: <51200C73.2060406@comcast.net>

I suspect I should have done things differently but ...

Last week I thought I was ready to switch from Ubuntu 10.04 to 12.04. I
had enough things working on 12.04 that I figured I'd be able to find
work arounds live, so to speak. There are three bits of hardware I
wanted to move from my old machine to my new machine, an nVidia card, a
Sound Blaster Live card, and a SCSI card. I took those out of my 10.04
machine and put them into my 12.04 machine. What I didn't do was to
unload the nVidia driver from the 10.04 machine before pulling the card.
I replaced the nVidia card with a Radeon card. Startup of the 10.04
machine wasn't smooth, but eventually I was able to -- I thought --
remove the nVidia driver and go with the (mumble-mumble) driver for the
Radeon card. Things worked okay for a day or so. However, for whatever
reason the machine decided it needed to restart. Now, X only gets as far
as showing the wallpaper on the two monitors, and nothing else. The
mouse works, but all it does is move its pointer around.

I dropped into a terminal and see the following error messages:

Many lines of (EE) FBDEV(0): FBIOPUTCHAMP: Invalid argument
(EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (Compatible NVIDIA X driver not
found)
cp: cannot stat `/ext/x11/xorg.conf': No such file or directory
/etc/gdm/failsafeXinit: line 113: return: zenity: numeric argument required
cp: cannot stat `/etc/x11/xorg.conf': No such file or directory
/etc/gdm/failsafeXinit: line 113: return: zenity: numeric argument required
cp: cannot stat `/etc/x11/xorg.conf': No such file or directory
/etc/gdm/failsafeXinit: line 113: return: zenity: numeric argument required


I am able to exit xinit with <CTRL>c, after which the rest of the
machine comes back up. I can log in, and I can do stuff from the command
line, including issuing a halt command.

What I want to do is to take the nVidia card, as well as the Sound
Blaster Live card and the SCSI card out of the new machine and put them
into the old machine. I'm sure this won't fix my problem, but that's
where I want to end up.

The current question is how do I tell the machine to stop looking for
the nVidia driver?

Would it help to remove the Radeon card and just use the VGA port on the
mother board?

I removed the Radeon card and rebooted. I was warned that I would be
working in lo-graphics mode and asked if I wanted to run that way for a
single session. I say OK.

The machine booted normally and, using Synaptic, I removed all the
nVidia packages.

I rebooted the machine but was warned that I would be working in
lo-graphics mode because of something related to nVidia. I went ahead.
Back in Synaptic I see that there are no nVidia packages installed.

Next I'll try putting the nVidia card back in the machine and see if
loading the nVidia package works this time.

My production machine is back to the way it was before last week.

When I powered up after installing the nVidia card the machine came up 
in lo-graphics mode, as expected. Using Synaptic I installed 
nvidia-current, which brought along nvidia-settings. After rebooting and 
running the nVidia X Server Settings tool, both monitors are back to 
their normal conditions.

Now. I still have to come up with a solution for when support for 10.04 
goes away in April. So far it looks like 12.04 won't support a couple of 
programs I use every day. Not sure if another distribution will, but I 
guess I'll start looking.

Subject: [PLUG] Posters (resolved)
Message-ID: <20130217083103.GB14012@gate.kl-ic.com>

A few weeks ago, I asked on the list about where to get posters
printed, and what tools to use to make them.  One of us has a
36 inch wide format HP printer, and we spend a pleasant wednesday
evening getting GIMP to print one set of posters.  I ran off
another set (as backup) at Orifice Depot today - that cost $36
for 18 square feet.  A lot cheaper than Kinkos, and that business
in Beaverton (who shall remain nameless) promised 3 days for sure,
but did not deliver in five.   My complements to Adam at the 
Cedar Hills Orifice Depot.

For tools, I originally set out to use Scribus - but that is
a workflow tool that assumes correct input text, without math.
Next I tried LyX, built on LaTeX, but there aren't any poster
templates for that.  Finally, I dived down into LaTeX using
the sciposter class, knocked out first pass posters plus
illustrations in a week (some illos took a day each), then
started to tweak. 

It took a couple of passes.  It is amazing how some mistakes
are invisible on the screen, but glare at you in 24 point text. 
Look at the PDF attachment at http://server-sky.com/Brown2013

Since I grew up with troff, and use TeX format for equations
on my wiki, LaTeX wasn't difficult to learn.  A great book is
Kopka and Daly, "A Guide to LaTeX".  I got the second edition
at Goodwill books online for $3, and the fourth edition is 
probably even more marvelous.  

Other notes:  TAP plastic sells three inch by two foot transparent
plastic tubes with endcaps for $7.50, good for strips of poster
and presumably good for getting them through airport security.

Also at O.D., they have Lexar S73 "USB3" thumb drives cheap.
I bought a 64GB for $40.  They apparently aren't as fast as 
most USB3 drives, and some folks have suffered failures with
them - from the sounds of the complaints, these may not do
erased sector recovery well.   Time will tell.

Subject: [PLUG] PyGl programming tutorial recommendations?
Message-ID: <5122851A.5030804@comcast.net>

Well, after last week it looks like I'll be sticking with Ubuntu 10.04 
until I can figure out how to find/make a couple of tools to do what I 
need in 12.04. I have the source for  the programs that I use, 
Transcribe and footpedal. What I'd like to do is to merge them into one 
program that is supported by tools in 12.04. It looks like Transcribe 
was made to work in 12.04 last year, but there hasn't been any activity 
on its Launchpad site for some months. There hasn't been any activity on 
the footpedal site, either. Footpedal seems to load, but it depends on 
putting an icon in a panel in Gnome that doesn't seem to be there in 
Gnome Classic.

I've been playing around a bit with 12.04 using Unity and find that I 
can figure out how to do stuff that I normally do, so I figure I ought 
to try writing a program that can do what I need with Unity.

I think Transcribe makes use of gstreamer. And I suspect there are a 
bunch of things in addition to making noise come out of the speaker that 
are provided by gstreamer that Transcribe uses. The one example I can 
think of is opening recent files. If I happened to listen to something 
in Movie Player and then open Transcribe to play back an interview, I 
find the  music file in the list of recent files. The same thing happens 
if I open Movie Player and look at it's list of recent files -- I see 
interview files listed there.

All that to say that I think I need to understand how to write some 
Python code that uses gstreamer. I found the following to be interesting:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Novacut/GStreamer1.0

It tells me that, not only do I need to work with a different version of 
gstreamer, but that I also need to work with PyGl instead of PyGST, 
neither of which I was aware of before this morning.

So, what I'm trying to find, now, is an introduction to PyGl. At least I 
think that's where I need to start. My search foo is turning up a mix of 
stuff that is related to chemistry or games.

Can anyone recommend some reading for writing the Hello World equivalent 
in PyGl?

Thanks.

Rich,

On top of everything else, it occurs to me that Ubuntu 12.x may
default to use Python 3, instead of Python 2.  The change in the
Python language has broken some older Python programs, to much
grumbling from the audience.  Ubuntu (and most other distros) are
supplying both versions of Python while things get sorted.
Perhaps you could try running your programs under Python 2.

Just a thought, and it may not come to anything, but I thought I'd
throw it out.

Thanks. I noticed something about Python 3 in my reading.

On my Ubuntu 12.04 (64 bit) installation I get:

~$ python --version

Message-ID: <CALYotCmeZzuj3ciF1dP04xngevqTK3DDztmFgpjhFOUoDOWVFg@mail.gmail.com>

I've been running Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop about half a year, generally
without problem, but now I have a potential problem - a question at least.
With the idea of avoiding a problem.

When I try to shut down, after having closed all the apps (that I'm aware
of), I hit the command to do so then get a window saying:

"A program is still running."
Unknown - not responding
"Waiting for the program to finish. Interrupting the program may cause you
to lose work."

There are three button options available - lock screen; cancel; shut down
anyway.

To this point - this has been going on for some days - I've been responding
with "cancel," but eventually I'll need to shut down, one way or another.
(Besides this glitch, the computer has been working fine.) I've tried
checking for odd processes (that might usefully be killed) in the system
monitor, but nothing jumps out at me.

I've also seen a reference to Firefox causing something like this to
happen, but I don't use Firefox - and have removed it from the launcher
(though I haven't disinstalled it).

I suppose I could "shut down anyway," but I don't know what the
consequences may be - and a Google search for the error message pulled up a
couple of vague references to file corruption, which is worrisome. Or I
could try something like the SysRq+ALT+REISUB shutdown, but again, I'm not
sure if that's a totally safe way under the circumstances.

Any thoughts, suggestions?

Without getting into the specifics, and I realize that this may not be all
that helpful to you, but I thought it may provide a little perspective:

if this screen popped up on my laptop, I would click Shutdown Anyway
without hesitation or a second thought.

This is just a normal upgrade (more or less). The difference between
update and dist-update is 

	   dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade,
           also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new
versions
           of packages; apt-get has a "smart" conflict resolution
system, and
           it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the
           expense of less important ones if necessary. So, dist-upgrade
           command may remove some packages. 

		(from man apt-get)

In practice the main difference you will notice is that dist-upgrade
install new kernels.
Update manager does a dist-upgrade by default so that is what you would
see in normal operation.

In the update -manager settings you can change to notify you only of LTS
releases (or not at all).

Message-ID: <CAJeYwHfQrbxhYyBU=pP5sDeJX99uJNg7Hzy+Xo_2=SJa4ovUqg@mail.gmail.com>

I have 2 SANDISK USB memory sticks, one is an older 8 gig vob and the
newer is a 32 gig vob.  Here's the problem.  When I stick the 32 gig
vob into a USB port, Ubuntu quickly recognizes it and mounts it into
the local file system and the "df" command shows it.  However when I
plug in the older 8 gig drive, Ubuntu seems confused, then mounts an
icon on the Gnome computer menu drop-down, but does not actually mount
the drive into the filesystem.  I have to manually mount this drive.

But I am puzzled as to why the icon appears because that meant that
the OS saw something.  Both are NTFS file systems.  Trying to run
GParted from the Gnome Desktop results in an endless "Scanning all
devices..." message which never terminates.

What could be wrong here?  I am assuming that something with the older
USB stick is causing the problems.

This problem seems to have recently appeared after Ubuntu 12.04 LTS upgrades.

while I have nothing helpful to contribute to your actual question, it may
help to clarify one point: as far as I can interpret, you are referring to
the portable USB drive (often termed a "thumb drive") as a VOB. I am
guessing the term you're looking for is "fob." I only point this out
because VOB is something else that could be relevant to this situation, and
if that's what you're really talking about, you should make that clearer.

I would mount the drive and do an ls -al.  for music players there is a
.file that the file manager interprets as instructions on what the device
supports.

Don't now the file names but I would suspect it is something like this.

Or it could be an error and I would check the system log.

Subject: [PLUG] PSU and Google Mail
Message-ID: <20130222182904.63480f8d@Devil8>

About a year ago Portland State moved all their mail to Google. I
suspect Google wrote them a handsome check in anticipation of getting
data on 30,000 users of the PSU mail system, but I don't know that for
sure.

What I do know is that my PSU mail has suddenly become unusable.
It is a very long story involving PSU administration and PSU computers,
hence being fubar is par.

The problem is that I have two accounts (a really long and stupid
story), and PSU suddenly noticed this and decided to disable the one I
normally used. I have hundreds of e-mails and contacts stored in this
account that I can no longer access. Worse, I have done voluntary
tutoring and for years PSU professors have been giving students my (now
disabled) e-mail address. This morning I got a phone call from a
student because his e-mail to me had bounced. Luckily he also had my
phone number.

There exists a process to add an alias so the old address automatically
redirects to the one good address. A week ago I was assured that this
would be taken care of "by the end of the day." It is still not
working. 

There also exists a process to "merge" the mail from the disabled
account into the new account. Again, this was supposed to happen a week
ago, and so far nothing has been done.

I have gone to the help desk in the basement of Smith once or twice a
day for the past several days. All I get is "we'll take care of it" and
a pat on the head. None of the help persons (students) actually know
what processes are required to create an alias in Google mail or to
merge the two addresses. 

There is no longer any point in talking to the help desk in Smith. They
see me coming and duck behind the counter.

I need to escalate this to someone who can actually fix the problem.
Does anyone know who that might be?

Message-ID: <20130222200325.10fec246@Devil8>

So I am looking through bank statements trying to find the date when I
bought a hard drive (probably failing) and I keep seeing transactions
for $19.95 to INTELIUS.

After calling my bank I discovered that it is an internet scam
operation that signs you up for credit security. I don't recall ever
doing this. My bank's fraud department is going to work on it.
According to the bank employee I talked to they have had thousands of
complaints from customers. If you Google on INTELIUS you will get lots
more.

So check your bank statements!

Another vote for "Shutdown Anyway".  Again, not that it helps you much, 
sorry.

But it is an occasion for me to complain about yet another instance of 
what this old UNIX crank sees as the creeping Windows-ization of Linux, at 
least in popular newbie-oriented distros like Ubuntu.  There comes a point 
when hiding complexity from the user becomes harmful, and cryptic system 
messages like this strike me as a good example.

*What* program is still running?
What PID?
What lockfile?

Come on, Ubuntu, would giving up those bits of information really be so 
hard?

Agreed, David.

Following Wes' suggest, I did shut down anyway ... and everything worked
fine. Thanks for the advice (I needed to get kicked off the fence).

One of my "users" recently reported occasional hung shutdowns.  Turns
out, when this occurred he had been running virtualbox and had
shutdown a windows vm in a suspended state.  I am guessing that a
shared filesystem from the vm on the host was responsible.

as an admin for several domains on google email hosting, I can say the
following with some degree of certainty:

aliasing one address to another is trivially easy. moving emails from one
account to another is complicated and convoluted. I spend HOURS doing this.

also: more than likely, no money changed hands between PSU and Google
regarding moving email hosting. Potentially some paid support calls to work
out details, but I seriously doubt anything beyond that.

Thanks for the observations.

It has been over a week and they have not succeeded in creating the
alias.

I can move the e-mails from the old account to the new one in a matter
of minutes with Claws-Mail, because both accounts are IMAP4. In fact, I
can just drag and drop entire folders from the old account to the new
one with the Claws-Mail GUI. In a matter of minutes Claws-Mail will move
the mails to the new account on the Google server. 

The problem is that the help desk people kept assuring me that I could
keep the old account (which was not correct), so I did not bother to
move the saved e-mails from my old account to the new one. Finally, the
old account was disabled. Now I cannot move the mails out of it to the
new account because I no longer have access to the old account. If only
someone would listen to me, enable the old account for 15 minutes, I
could resolve most of the problem. But the front desk people do not
have the authority to do this, and I can't get to anyone who does have
the authority.

In the meantime, Friday morning I received a phone call from a student
because his e-mail to me had bounced. I volunteer to help students in
their linguistics classes. For years professors have been giving out my
e-mail address (and sometimes my phone number, fortunately) to students
as a resource they can contact when they need help. There are hundreds
of these students and I have no way to communicate to them that I have
a new e-mail address. Not being reachable by students is a vacation for
me, but ultimately not good.

PSU is a very frustrating place.

Yes, PSU administration in general is HORRIBLE. But some of that is funding
constraints, and some of that is general ineptitude.

Hi Everyone

I have forgotten everything I should know.

I have a TDS Actionted GT701 D asdl modem..

I have a web site that I ssh into....

I need to back the web site up to my home computer while the web guy
does maintenance on the web box.

I don't know how to configure the TDS box to accept ssh so I can get through..

Or a good place to start...

I set the admin name and password on the TSD box.


TIA

Marvin

Why not use FTP client or rsync from your home PC?  ssh is a bit round
about to just transfer data (log into remote box then log BACK into
home box).

The GT701 will allow outgoing connections such as FTP.

There are a number of FTP clients.  I use gFTP and FireFTP (Firefox
add on) to transfer data to my web sites.

Hi..

Don't know much about rsync.  But, I can probably install an FTP
server and do ftp.  Will check out both..

Marvin,

Have you already tried connecting to the web server from your home PC
using SSH? Most home routers do not block outgoing traffic and only
require modification for inbound traffic, which this would not be. You
should be able to use scp or sftp to connect to the web server from
home. If you're using Windows at home, WinSCP is a great program for
doing this. On Linux most graphical file managers support sftp://
addresses to accomplish the same.

I would be very surprised if whoever is hosting your web site isn't
already running an FTP server on that box along with the web server
software.  Sort of a standard way to do things.

How do you normally post/send updated files to your web site?

You should be able to backup the whole site using wget.

All,

This just came across from our Sys Admin team:
*
"They may be able to increase it [user processes] a little, but probably
not enough to resolve the problem, which was the case last time we saw this
issue.  Linux [user processes] cannot be set to unlimited like other unix
flavors."*

I find this hard to believe. However, the more I think about it maybe it's
true since you need to put a # in /etc/security/limits.conf?

Daniel,

   For those of us not in the profession please explain the context of this
issue. Does it refer to the number of processes owned by each user, the
resources used by all processes owned by a user, or something else?

Just curious,

Rich

You don't have to.  SCP works both ways, as does rsync.
What program are you using to upload web content?

What is a "little"?  Can you or they be more specific?  We set the user limits fairly high in /etc/security/limits.conf for the Oracle Fusion accounts - keep increasing it.  Of course, the Fusion application servers have hefty amounts of CPU and memory.

Not sure how what the current value is set to, nor by how much they fell
they can raise it.

The context is that we have an enterprise job scheduler (like cron, only
enteprrise based instead of local) that is starting processes on this
machine. One of the application groups came back and said they had
processes failing with this error. It appears the user has limits set on
the number of processes it can open. When the scheduling team asked about
increasing the proc limit to unlimited, the sys admins replied that it
wasn't possible in Linux.

For user sessions I have used ulimit -s unlimited on RHEL before and though
that was what was occurring. But then if I edited limits.conf I've always
put a value in, so thought maybe unlimited was not really possible after
all. That maybe the true source of the sys admins, that they need a value
to put in limits.conf.

In the context of having to execute background processes for a user (either
through cron or another solution) how do you set procs to unlimited in
limits.conf?

From 'man 5 limits.conf':

"All items support the values -1, unlimited or infinity indicating no limit, except for priority and nice."

There are caveats, but unlimited/infinity is at least hinted at being supported. 

My man page comes from an ubuntu 10.04 LTS system .

Same line exists in the man page on CentOS 6.3.

Changing ulimit -c is also necessary if you would like a core dump from 
a program when it crashes - say from a segmentation fault. It's been a 
while since I have used it, but a core dump can be real handy. Start up 
a debugger like ddd (data display debugger), load a core dump and you 
can see exactly where your program crashed.

Subject: [PLUG] Flickering monitor
Message-ID: <20130228204237.0e986537@Devil8>

This morning I noticed that the ASUS (model # buried someplace) 22" LCD
monitor that my desktop computer uses was flickering. It was not the
entire monitor, just menu items in programs. If I selected a menu item
in the program the flickering would cease while the menu dropdown was
displayed. It was really difficult to click on things because I had to
click precisely when the flicker was at the top. 

At first I thought it was Banshee, because that is what was on the
screen at the time. I could not easily terminate Banshee because of the
difficulty in clicking on things, so I opened a GUI terminal. When the
terminal opened it immediately displayed "do you want to list all 2253
items? Y/N," as though I had already given it a command. It accepted
"N" from the keyboard without problem, and I was able to terminate
Banshee, but the "do you want to list all 2253 items?" message kept
re-displaying. 

Finally I tried other programs and discovered that the flickering was
happening with all of them.

I rebooted the computer and the flickering started as soon as the GUI
came up. I was in a hurry and only wanted to get Banshee running so I
could listen to an internet radio station while I finished getting
ready to go to PSU. Although it was flickering, Banshee operated
normally as soon as it took my click on the start button for the
station I wanted.

Half an hour later I was ready to leave the house. As I sat down to do
a last minute e-mail check on my laptop (different computer) I glanced
at the screen for the desktop and noted that the flickering had stopped.
Not having time to deal with it further, or any idea what to do next, I
left the house with Banshee running, streaming the radio station.

When I came home about 7:15 I looked at the screen and Banshee was back
to flickering, although otherwise operating normally with the same
station still streaming. An hour later it stopped flickering. 

The computer is a 3 year old desktop that I built myself with an ASUS
M2NPV-VM motherboard. It is running a recently installed Xubuntu 12.04,
using the GeForce 6150 on the motherboard with the open source nouveau
drivers. Software Update reports that it is up to date.

Conclusions:

It seems to me that the most likely source of the problem is the nouveau
driver. I say this because it is only menu items and lists that are
flickering, not the entire screen.

However, there has not been any flickering until this morning, and no
software changes (i.e., updates) have been made for at least three
weeks. That makes it sound like a hardware problem. However, why would
a hardware problem affect only menus and lists in program windows?

I find nothing of interest in /var/log/messages, nor is there anything
in xorg.0.log. 

I could use some suggestions and ideas for further troubleshooting.

It sounds a bit like your tab key is getting stuck, or something is causing
your computer to think the tab key is held down. (And possibly another key
like alt.)

The flickering you describe sounds like the fast shift of focus from one
menu entry to the next and back around.

On your other machine: try holding down (or tapping very quickly) tab and
another key (such as as alt, shift, or ctrl) and see if the behavior is
similar.

This doesn't sound like an actual video problem to me, mostly because of
what you saw in the terminal.

Why not both?  SSH provides a simple and secure entry method.  rsync is 
a great backup tool and it can use the ssh protocol.  No need for a 
full-blown FTP tool.

In order to use ssh through your router you need to configure your 
firewall to allow communication through port 22 (or another port of your 
choosing).  A non-standard port is often chosen for security reasons.

You configure your receiver's ssh service to listen on the port you 
chose and set up a log-in method.  You can use a simple 
username/password configuration or go with a public/private key login 
system.

Links like this show how to setup password-less ssh on the destination 
system:
http://www.adminschoice.com/how-to-configure-ssh-without-password

Once you get your ssh access configured you simply issue a command like:

rsync -avh (src path) -e "ssh -p (port number)" username@(ip 
address):~/(dest path)

Subject: [PLUG] ANNOUNCEMENT: Personal Telco's "Build OpenWrt" Play Day on
	Sunday
Message-ID: <86zjynitm6.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


Where: https://personaltelco.net/wiki/NodeWorldCup
When: Sunday, March 3, 2013, 1:00-5:00 p.m.
What: https://personaltelco.net/wiki/PlayDay20130303

The Personal Telco Project uses OpenWrt heavily in devices it uses to
build wifi infrastructure around Portland, almost always building the
firmware from source, adapted to the particular purpose.  The purpose
might be a standardized node, a mesh networking node, or it might be a
highly adapted solution to something like a data logger application.

This play day is intended to help spread the knowledge of how Personal
Telco constructs these firmwares and, more generally, the finer points
of how to build OpenWrt for any particular purpose you might have.
And, if you find we do it in an idiotic way, you can suggest
improvements. ;-)

This is a hands-on event.  Bring yourself, your curiosity, and a linux
box you can build on (or a way to connect over the network to one,
like me).

You can bring a device too, but this is primarily a software-focused
event.  If there is enough time, we could start looking at flashing
problems.  If there is enough interest, we could have a follow up Play
Day that focuses on those issues, a kind of Linux Clinic for your
router.

Come on out and have some fun!

OK

I can use ssh and scp from my computer to the web server..

I can't ssh into the web server and then  ssh into my home box from
the web server.

I must disagree here.  Nouveau does not care about the purpose for
the pixels it blasts onto the screen.  It just needs to know how
to put them together.  So it's not going to affect just a menu
entry.  Rather, you'd see blocks of corrupt pixels, without regard
for what those pixels represent, assuming that Nouveau or Mesa
didn't simply crash.  On the other hand, the programs that build
the graphical entities that are converted to pixels do care about
them, since they are creating them.  So you need to look somewhere
other than your video driver.

Given that you were seeing screwy things in a terminal window,
this strongly hints at a keyboard problem.  I've seen things like
this before, when I had something sitting on my keyboard and
holding down a key.  Given what you saw in the terminal, I'd guess
it's the TAB key.

And now I see I've been ninja'd by Rogan Creswick.  Oh well.  I
think he's right.  Do you, by any chance, have a spare keyboard
you can try?

Another place to look, at least for graphical programs, is
"$HOME/.xsession-errors".  Be prepared to find large quantities of
crap in that file.  [Rant about vacuum-brained morons who use an
error log file as a cache file deleted.]

Anyway, I hope this helps.
