Do you know which DRM format they used?  I will see what I can find.
There was a package from Russia that removed pretty much all of the PDF
DRM formats.  I will see if I have a copy.

Fedora core 2 works fine with my DVD recorder.  You just need a current
version of cdrecord with the DVD extensions.  (Which Fedora ships with.)

For burning DVDs and /or CDs I recommend k3b.  It has the look and feel
of Nero and handles all sorts of tasks.  It is a kde app.  Quite cool.

There are enough variations out there to meet pretty much any criteria you
have.  Here are some criteria that are often overlooked:

Focus
-----

Many, many cameras I've tried focus poorly.  The LCD is too small to tell
that the image is blurry, so you won't know until you upload it to your
PC, which is usually too late to re-shoot.  A true digital SLR won't have
this problem ($1000ish), nor do some of the cheaper fixed-focus cameras
($100-200ish).

It's often hard to tell if a given camera is fixed focus or not based on
the specs.  Any camera with an optical zoom won't be fixed-focus.  (And
digital zoom is a complete waste since all it does is enlarge the pixels
from the CCD.)

Time Before Ready
-----------------

Some cameras seem to take an eternity to "boot up", others have a
significant lag between when you hit the button and when the photo is
taken.  This might not seem like a big deal, but after missing a few great
shots, somehow this becomes very important.

Size
----

Many digital cameras are small enough to tuck into a pocket at all times.
This is great since good photo chances can show up at off times.  There's
really no need to get a larger one unless it's a digital SLR.

Battery Life
------------

If you get a camera that will run off alkalines, it's possible to keep it
in that same pocket I just mentioned for weeks and still be able to shoot.
Rechargable NiMH batteries lose power slowly over several weeks-- often to
the point where they don't work when you want them too.  For any expected
shooting (vacation, special event, etc.) you'll want to use rechargables,
but for just having the camera ready, alkalines are great.

Megapixels
----------

Far, far, far less important than the marketing arms of the camera
companies would have you believe.  An out-of-focus high resolution photo
is just as crappy as an out-of-focus low resolution photo.

Summary
-------

I've been very happy with my Olympus D-380, though it's been discontinued.
It is fixed-focus, which means it shoots very quickly and each photo past
about 24" is guaranteed to be in perfect focus.  (There is no delay
waiting for the AF system to decide where to focus, then move the lens to
that spot.)  It's also small, with very good battery life.  Best of all, a
full setup with larger SmartMedia card, PCMCIA reader, and appropriate USB
cable was only $220.  The camera works great with recent versions of
Linux via USB, and the PCMCIA reader even works with older versions of
Linux.

I'm having the same difficulty with some Adobe eBooks.  Unfortunately, the
only way to view them is not available:

-----
http://www.adobe.com/support/ebookrdrfaq.html#linux
-----

The Acrobat 6.01 DRM features seem to work under Windows/VMware.  I
haven't tried them with WINE, but I suspect there may be problems since
the software actively tries to cease working if run in an unfamiliar
environment, e.g. under a debugger:

-----
http://www.adobe.com/support/ebookrdrfaq.html#de-bugger
-----

The only solution I've seen so far would be to print them to a PS file and
convert it.  (The new version of Adobe won't print to a printer configured
locally to print to a file, so you'll have to use a network printer that
prints to a file.)  The resulting PS file contains several lines
threatening dire DMCA consequences for removing them and won't print or
convert using a stock Ghostscript.  Since this is being done on content
that has already been licensed to me for the purposes of interoperability,
the DMCA restrictions shouldn't apply.  However, I'm not a lawyer, and I'm
not saying that I've actually done this.

Some of the info here will explain how to convert these PS files into
something that will work for you on Linux:

(Gallery of Adobe Remedies)
http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Adobe/Gallery/

Remember to let the companies distributing Adboe eBooks know how unhappy
you are with the format.  Without this feedback, they'll assume that we're
all happy with the horrible fair use restrictions on it.

Avoid HP. Well, their peasant, sub-$200 consumer stuff anyways, although I
suppose that goes for all manufacturers * <--- BIG STAR

If you have a bunch of money, the Canon 1DS is very nice and should be
dropping in price / leaving shelves in the next couple weeks as canon
releases a new version. For about $700-800, the Canon EOS 300D can be bought
and there is a hacked firmware which gives you a bunch of features found in
the next level camera (mirror lock up, etc). 
That said; if you're just going to be snapping pics of parties and stuff and
really don't care too much about photography, don't spend a ton unless you
feel like blowing dough.

* - If you DO like photography (I don't want to sound like a pessimist or
cynical bastard - BUT . . .) you're probably not going to be thrilled with
the quality of anything under $250-300, so you might as well go a step or
two up.

You will be shocked and amazed at the higher end stuff like the 1DS / 10D,
although they have a sticker price that is equally shocking (and 35mb images
at full res in RAW mode). If you find a Canon D30 / D60, consider those as
well, although they have been end of life'd for a while now but are really
nice compared to the other stuff. 
I know a bunch of people who went for cameras in the $400-$600 range but
then upgraded to a better model in a couple months, you might want to try
out something a bit "higher end" and see if you like it - you might save
yourself some money in the long run. 

I've heard the Nikon coolpix series is a decent, more or less portable
cameras, a wee bit expensive but you might want to try one out.

Battery life is great, but you should try to get something that takes NIMH
AAs. If you don't have a charger, etc, yet, expect to get one.

Avoid cameras with plastic lenses like the plague. There is a reason webcams
are $30 and look like crap. A real lens is nice, and helps a lot with
pictures (especially at night).
Digital zoom is useless, but you know that, so ignore those numbers. It
should be called digital crop but some marketing troll decided to put a
positive spin on things. 
You're probably not going to be happy with the quality of night pics in a
ccd camera. - I threw together a couple sample pics - check the capitol
records night pic - and just expect that on pretty much every night photo
unless you get a tripod / beanbag and do a 10 sec exposure. 
http://vehiclehitech.com/samples/ 
Those pics are pretty good, but there were a lot of crap ones too. You can't
really zoom in though, the resolution / quality just isn't quite there.
Those were shot with a HP 850 which is a fairly decent camera, although I'd
go a bit higher if I was going to buy a camera. I had 4 hp 720s in a row,
all broke within a month of me getting them (and right before / during
trips). HP was nice enough to send me the 850 as a replacement after a
little bit of whining on my part. I sort of want to rag on their products,
but a lot of their stuff has gotten much better in the last year (at least
in cameras) and their support / customer service is excellent in this area -
they even speak English as a first language!

BTW, there are a bunch of websites selling the HP 215 for $75 or something,
avoid that - it's a crap camera that is 3 years old (worth maybe $25), I'm
not sure why so many places have extra stock, just a word of warning. I had
one and it sure likes batteries (like 40 pics = 4AAs). 

Check out www.dpreview.com for a bunch of sample pics / reviews from a ton
of cameras - they are aimed toward the higher end cameras, but they have a
bit of midrange stuff too.

This site may help:
http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare.asp

You select the importance of various features, options, and price, then
compare cameras that meet your criteria.

I read somewhere that you need 3 megapixels to clearly print an 8x10.
You can get that at a reasonable price now. I am happy with my HP 735
Photosmart; 3.2 mp, 15x optical zoom, short video clip works with linux,
under $200 IIRC.

I got a Nikon coolpix 2??? last year, and am very happy with it.
The picture quality is pretty good, and it's small enough to fit 
in a pocket, yet big enough to hang on to when taking pictures.

As others have said it depends on what you want. 

IMHO, it's hard to go wrong with either Olympus or Nikon. Cannon is good
too, but they have a history of mucking with things in ways that makes
life hard for Linux developers. 

I have an Olympus 5060 - which is a 5 Megapixel range-finder style camera.
I like that configuration because it is smaller and lighter than the SLRs
and because you can use the LCD as a viewfinder - which you can't do on
most SLRs. The downside is that you can't change lenses.

Steve's Digicams is a good place to read up on digital cameras. He has
reviews of all most all of the current models:

I've been extremely pleased with my Fuji Finepix 2800Z. Example pics at 
http://www.dimstar.net/gallery

Bonus. I paid $300 for mine, two years ago. It's a 2 megapixel camera. 
Now, you can get the 4 megapixel version for around $300.

These cameras have 6X optical zoom.

Viewfinder through the viewfinder or the lcd display.

Mounts to any OS I've tried it on as a USB drive.

Subject: SUMMARY - Graphical Boot
**************************************************

Judging from google, a lot of folks have tried to get rid of
graphical boot and go with a text boot.  By graphical/text boot
I'm talking about the boot process that happens after one chooses
the kernel, or operating system, via lilo or grub.  I had a funny
experience with this and thought I'd share so that google will
have one more answer to go with the bizillion questions.

I've been installing Mandrake 10.0 official time and time again
so that I can automate the process as much as possible.  The
saved package list really helps; I wish the "auto install" would
work.  The last time I installed the graphical booting went away,
and I couldn't get it back.  While troubleshooting it here's what
I learned:

- I can configure the boot process to some extent via the
  "configure your system" -> "boot" -> "boot loader" sequence.
  When configuring the "boot loader" select a kernel, choose
  "modify", click "advanced" and notice the display selector.
  Setting it to "normal" will provide text boot.  Setting it to a
  frame buffer will provide a graphical boot, except...

- Between my two installs I doubled my RAM, ending up at 1GB.
  This caused the install process to default to Mandrake's
  kernel-i686-up-4GB kernel.  The previous kernel I used,
  kernel-2.6.3.7mdk only addresses 896MB of RAM; this kernel was
  installed too, but the other kernel is the default.

- As it turns out all of the kernels I have on my system
  responded as expected to my choice of a graphical boot up,
  except for the kernel-i686-up-4GB kernel.

I suppose I could build a custom kernel that would provide for
graphical boot and for my RAM size, but I think I'll just live
with the text boot.

I hope this helps someone.....

Can't say for sure, but the "focus" problem could be an issue of the
auto-exposure shutter speed.  Used to be the rule of thumb was
anything under about 1/64 second (or whatever it was) shutter speed
hand-held would be blurred.  So, in low-light conditions, the camera
is going to open up the aperture (as much as possible, maybe not much)
and slow down the shutter speed, the latter having a blurring effect.
If a flash makes it not blurry, then shutter speed is your problem.

You may wish to check out HTML::TreeBuilder.  You can read an article about it at
http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/HTML-Tree-3.18/lib/HTML/Tree/Scanning.pod

If you feel more comfortable with procedural parsing, check out HTML::TokeParser::Simple. 
http://search.cpan.org/~ovid/HTML-TokeParser-Simple-2.2/

The trick here would be to identify your start table tag and then only identify the end of a
record when you don't have any intervening table tags to "pair" with the closing tag.  The
following is untested and should be considered pseudo-code and probably has bugs.

  use HTML::TokeParser::Simple;
  my $parser = HTML::TokeParser::Simple->new($html_doc);
  my @records = fetch_records($parser)

  sub fetch_records {
    my $parser = shift;
    my @records;
    while (my $token = $parser->get_token) {
      do { $token = $parser->fetch_token } until $token && is_start_record($token);
      my $html = '';
      while ( ! is_end_record($token) ) {
        $html .= $token->as_is;
        $token = $parser->fetch_token;
      }
      pushd @records => $html;
    }
    return @records;
  }
    
  sub is_start_record {
    my $token = shift;
    return $token->is_start_tag('table')
        && $token->return_tag('width')  == 500
        && $token->return_tag('border') == 0   # we've have problems with undef borders
        && $token->return_tag('class')  =~ /^[AB]$/;
  }

  my $TABLES == 0;
  sub is_end_record {
    my $token = shift;
    if ($token->is_start_tag('table')) {
      $TABLES++;
    }

Message-ID: <40E46809.50001@robinson-west.com>

Poking around with my reference XP home dial up connection, I notice I 
have to have ip header
compression enabled.  Disabling LCP and software compression works fine. 
 How do I turn on
ip header compression in Redhat 6.2's wvdial?  Is this the same as Van 
Jacobsen header
compression?  Do I need to recompile the kernel for header compression?

Is there any way in XP to print out the settings of the dial up 
connection?  I'm not
going to put XP on a 486, but I'm looking for something it has to do 
that I haven't
thought of yet.  It would be nice under XP to capture the whole entire 
link up
conversation in case I'm missing something.

One thing I wonder about is if XP's dialer announces that it's a Windows XP
system.  Seems unlikely that there would be a filer for clients that 
don't  announce
themselves as XP, but I certainly can't trust that the configuration 
Windows in XP
are revealing everything.  It would be nice if the average phone company 
would
just set up Linux ppp servers.

Who needs to sell your email address?  Can't someone just guess it?  I 
don't see how bank
numbers are safe either unless you need the correct social security 
number.  I have a lot of
spammy maillog entries, but very little actual spam.  Being unreliable 
for unknown clients
is fairly affective at stopping spam.  If people couldn't use fake or 
forged addresses, it
would be easier to filter based on source.  Lot less work and more 
accurate than content
filtering.

IM2000 would probably increase the amount of mail.  If the notifications 
of this protocol
are always safe, IM2000 could be used to reduce filtering and anti virus 
checking.  Only
allowing recipients to get an address for an attachment, instead of the 
attachment itself,
could discourage people who want to send junk anonymously.  A good 
filter system
should allow you to filter by ignoring.  The notifications could be 
timed out and auto
deleted for example.

My wife and I are pretty happy with the Canon Powershot A40 we purchased
1.5 years ago.  It uses a compact flash card, and we have a PCMCIA 
adapter that fits the laptops and mounts nicely under Linux.  It is also
physically compatable with microdrives, should I ever go hog wild and
need to take 1000 pictures at once.  It uses 4 standard AA cells, either
NiMH or standard.  I carry an extra 4 batteries in the pouch, along with
an extra flash memory, and carry a car charger on trips.

The Canon takes good, sharp pictures without a lot of fuss - the focus 
is close to the pixel resolution on this 2MPix unit.  Complaints - the
autofocus results in a long "shutter lag" between pushing the button and
taking the picture.  This makes taking pictures out the window of a Shinkansen
bullet train highly problematical. :-)  Also, the power-up defaults to the
flash in dark conditions, and you have to remember to turn it off if you
don't want it.  That is more a matter of individual preference, though.

The main thing to remember about digital cameras is "take LOTS of pictures!"
Hold down that button and get three or four shots;  the only thing it 
costs you is a little sort and discard time.  

And for advice on the high end stuff, Randal Schwartz is the king of
the cameras.  Talk to him if you want to go hog wild.

A lot depends on how much money you want to spend. I wouldn't recommend
anything below 3 megapixels.

I have a Nikon 990 that I've been using for about 4 years. It's been
very good to me. It was ~$1,000 when it was new. Now cameras like the
8 megapixel Minolta Dimage A2 are in that price range. A friend got
one and sent me a picture he took... it was stunning, and I'm now
suffering from severe envy :-P 

I also second the recommendation to get one with AA batteries and get a
set of good NiMH rechargables. My Nikon ate alkalines like butter in a
hot sun, but I'm still using the 8 NiMH's I bought 4 years ago, and
they seem to last almost forever. Quality counts, though. I've seen
cheap ones that don't last any longer than alkalines. I got mine from
Thomas Distributing (http://www.thomasdistributing.com) Their combo
(http://www.thomasdistributing.com/mhc401fs.htm) is a good deal, and
the current batteries are almost 50% more capacity than the ones I
got 4 years ago.

Thank you.  Wow, looks kinda tricky.  Seems like there are
a lot of assumptions about what won't change.  It might have
been easier to implement another protocol and generate a
tcp/ip stream at the destination.

Hopefully, ip header compression is the only thing special that
XP uses to connect.  I want to know if XP is using pap or chap
though.  It appears that wvdial can handle that though.

Well, the RFC says 1990, I know that 6.2 isn't that old.

The Olympus D380 I mentioned has a fixed f/4 aperture, so I get to see
motion blur a lot.  When the background is sharp and the two people
standing close up on the left/right are blurry, it wasn't motion blur.
;-)

This camera is never out of focus unless I shoot too close (under 2' from
the camera or so.)  It has a "macro" mode that drops the aperture to f/8
and allows focus down to about 12" and makes it damn near impossible to
handhold without motion blur except in full sun...

Uh, as far as I know, there's only one digital rangefinder camera on the

I'll second that.  I get mine here:

But it looks like the same product line.  Don't know which is closer to

I think I use Powerex batteries in everything in my house that uses
batteries (except the smoke detectors).

  If by 'rangefinder' one means a separate view window for composing the
exposure, rather than viewing through the lens, then my 1995-vintage Olympus
D-340L is a rangefinder-type digital camera. And, for my purposes of
documenting projects with images that will be printed on paper as part of a
report, the 1.2 Mpixel resolution (or less, at higher resolutions) does me
just fine.

That's not what's meant by "rangefinder camera".

A rangefinder is a type of camera that has a built-in device for measuring
distance based on the principles of triangulation. The photographer
focuses the camera by superimposing two slightly different views of a
scene with the rangefinder.

  Really, Jeme??? Like the Exacta and Plauble Makina I had in the 1950s and
the Leica I had in the 1960s? Wow!

  Sarcasm aside, I don't know of any focusing mechanism on the non-slr
digital cameras. That's why I wrote, "If what you mean is ...".

Sigh,

Message-ID: <40E4C337.5040909@comcast.net>

Hi,

I upgraded from Mandrake 9.1 to 10.0 and am experiencing some difficulty 
with mounting smbfs from /etc/fstab.  Here's the error:

The behavior is somewhat predictable.  From bash, I can navigate around 
in the mounted directory and perform normal command-line file work, no 
problem.  Attempting to browse to it from KDE makes the system very 
unstable, produces the following error message, and will lock up:

"Window with title "file:/home/robert/mnt/SPOTTED/robert - Konqueror" is 
not responding.  This window belongs to application konqueror (PID =

Do you wish to terminate this application?  (All unsaved data in this

Looking for tips and help.

Although that is the more or less agreed upon definition, some cameras have
the "focusing" beam thingy (Patent by Microsoft Probably Pending) which
allows them to judge the distance to an object in order to properly set the
auto focus.  The distance is stored in the EXIF data as part of the picture
which also stores shutter speed, etc. The info is nice to have, but I don't
know of a camera on the market that doesn't save that data (I think some of
the earlier coolpix cameras might of have not. Or something.)

In most cases, I've seen this to be shockingly accurate (assuming the camera
is focused on the proper thing, etc, etc) and I've sometimes used it as a
measuring tape for long distances when one isn't handy for distances up to
about 70 meters. 

I would strongly recommend getting a camera that has this feature - although
it is nice to be able to disable it for weddings and other such events,
where a red / ?? grid / beam, etc is not the most desirable and shows up a
bit too well in home videos.

That's not what's meant by "rangefinder camera".

A rangefinder is a type of camera that has a built-in device for measuring
distance based on the principles of triangulation. The photographer
focuses the camera by superimposing two slightly different views of a
scene with the rangefinder.

It's highly dependent on your focal length - the rule of thumb for hand 
held shooting that I go by (and which has served me well) is never shoot 
shutter speeds slower than 1/"focal length" rounded to the nearest 
hopefully faster shutter speed your camera supports - eg: with a 50mm 
lens don't shoot slower than 1/60 shutter, on a giant 600mm telephoto 
don't shoot slower than 1/750.

Unfortunately every not-expensive digicam that I've seen never tells you 
things like what your focal length is in a zoom situation, but they 
might exist.

I heard a variation on this as use a shutter speed that is at slowest 
the reciprocal of the focal length of the lens, the rationale being 
camera shake is more noticeable at greater magnifications, so higher 
shutter speeds are necessary to freeze that motion. 1/60 sec at 60mm, 
1/120 at 120mm, etc. Of course the numbers get skewed for non-35mm 
cameras and digital SLRs.

I just dropped the big dollars on a Nikon D70. So far, I like it.

The ~1.5X magnification over a 35mm SLR is great if you like telephoto 
shots (my 210mm acts like a 300mm now) but you lose wide-angle 
capability at the same time. That's a bummer cause you pay a lot to get 
that really wide, almost fisheye effect. Oh, and digital noise doesn't 
have nearly the same nice character as film grain.

Message-ID: <1088734465.2145.10.camel@athena.freegeek.org>

I have a new eMachines M6809 and I really like it a lot. Very nice
keyboard and power to spare. HOWEVER, I have had real problems with
various versions of Linux.

I upgraded my Mandrakeclub subscription to Silver in order to get at the
64 bit bittorrent, but when loaded MDK10.0-64 is MUCH slower than
anything I have ever run - including Knoppix on a 233 MHz PII with 128K
RAM.

I tried Fedora Core 2 64 bit and had the usual heartburning problems
with that to the point where I ripped it out by the roots and installed
Knoppix 3.4 32 bit in a partition. I've been tracking the Debian Pure64
and 32/64 progress, but they are a loooong way from being soup.

I kept hearing reports that SuSE 9.1 works just ducky with a 64 bit
version included in the boxed set. So I goes and plunks down yet more
money (and money is pretty tight around my house these days) and ordered
the boxed set last Thursday. It didn't come today, so I checked the
order progress and the damn thing hasn't shipped yet! And to make things
better, the only way I can download the damn thing is to cancel my order
for the boxed set!

ARGH!

So, does anyone have the boxed set with the AMD64 CDs (or the downloaded
ISOs) yet? Would you share them with me? I can show you my receipt. I
really did pay my money. You can respond to me directly, rather than the
list <ron at nutriware.com>.

Thanks,

Yes, the bleeding edge of what you can get at $1000 has been amazing.

I starteed with a Coolpix 950 in 98, and now am using a Canon Digital

I'm using film in terms of flexibility and speed and resulting images.
Except I'm not spending 45 cents every time I pull the trigger. :)

Hello, 

Semi-new Linux user here wondering if any of you had any input on a
pcmcia wireless card I could purchase for my Compaq Presario laptop.
I've looked into various models and some groups say that if it's TI
based that it will not work, maybe if you're very very lucky, but if
it's Broadcom based then chances are that drivers are available. The 3
cards that I've researched and emailed manufacturers about, as well as
searched the net, say that there's nothing for Linux. I prefer
802.11g. Anyone know of any decently priced models that will work with
RH7.3 2.4.18 that I could purchase in the downtown area?

There are Linux TI drivers in the works (acx100.sourceforge.net) but
the driver is still pretty immature. So it's probably best to continue
avoiding TI chips for now.

One thing to watch out for is D-Link cards. D-Link has a nasty habit
of replacing the guts of their product without changing the model number
that's printed on the box. The DWL-G650 for example, which I was
investigating just moments ago, has used at least two and maybe three
different chipsets, the Prism GT, the TI ACX100, and some Atheros chipset.

D-Link did the same with the DWL-650 (no 'G'). We were trying to get one
working at the last PLUG monthly clinic. It was some new varient. We
never did figure out what was inside.

  The 3Com 3CRWE154G72 is a Prism54 card that does b and g. It does work
with my Slackware-9.1/2.4.24 system. According to the folks at EmperorLinux
it is even easier to get it working on the Red Hat flavors.

  Whether or not it's available locally I've no idea.

Resolved.  It wan't needing header compression after all.  Turns out,
wvdial's config file shouldn't have had extra spacing on the username
and password lines.  I also used quotes.

Thanks for the help though ;-)

... for marketing research.

Just a note on this thread started by Ron awhile back....

I didn't go to the C++ and Fortran product test they wanted; but,
they called me for a different one and I went.

The person at Intel who conducted the test suggested to me that Linux
users are scarce in the Pacific Northwest.  I was shocked.  She
defended the statement by saying that they can't seem to get linux
users to come in to give them feedback.

It was a very pleasant experience and they NEED feedback from 
open source types, given what I saw... plus you get some pocket
change for going in.

Further, she wants people who talk alot and have opinions about
software, how it should be, what it should do, etc.... So, I encourage
you guys to subject yourselves to it.  I think giving them feedback
about how to build software we like will help us in the long run (even
if we have to be video taped and have strange Intel people examining
our mannerisms ;-).

  And this from a marketing person? If you have tools that meet your needs
available to you at no cost why would you want to go out and spend a lot of
money on replacements? Did you offer her a clue card?

  Why do they need the feedback? For the benefit of ...?

Well, technically, I don't know if she's a marketing person.  She
conducted the interview/test/whatevery-you-call-it.  For all I know,
she's a primate scientist studying how well we respond to working in
cubicles.

One might buy a replacement for their extant tools for any number of
reasons.  Tech support, the ability to blame someone else for
something, because your boss told you to, because your company made a
deal with Intel, because you have to get rid of your extra budget this
fiscal year or else next year's will be smaller, or because someone on
your board of directors doesn't believe in open source tools, etc.
Who knows?

In any case, I'll gladly use whatever works, money or not.  It just
so happens that the open source stuff works most of the time.

So they can learn what it takes to make software that meets our
standards.  Either way you cut it, even if they use the feedback to
make better software that they sell, then it's still better software.
Or, perhaps, since they're a hardware company, they'll commit more
resources to building open source software.

But it benefits _us_ (and PLUG, specifically) to convince others to 
think like us.  Spread the word... advocate... all that hooha.

Intel actually has some sociologists who study how people use
computers.  They funded the Hawthorne Hostel PTP node as a project.

Intel has been uneven in its support of Linux, but it's contributed a 
bunch of code to the kernel. Some of it is support for Intel hardware 
(e100, e1000, and IA64 stuff), but Intel also contributed a bunch of 
the ethernet-bonding code and a smaller amount of ethtool code. Intel 
has also been the prime mover in getting a reference implementation of 
the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) into the kernel.

It also recently announced that the next generation of Intel BIOS code 
will be released under an open-source license.

I think it's a good step if Intel is actively doing Linux Q/A on new 
products, hardware or software. I think that's what we *want* 
commercial companies to be doing. I, for one, am glad when companies 
like AMD, Sun, NetworkAppliance, Intel, etc. treat Linux as a serious 
platform.

In other words, I am going to go get the CDs tomorrow morning (I'm
leaving for The Dead concert right now) and so I don't need any more

  The replacement wireless access point arrived today. I suspect that some

before I go configure it for my network? (The cdrom setup wizzard runs only

The problem is that the times they have wanted people in has been the same

IRC is also fairly interesting and diverse.

Of course, I imagine the typical IRC channel would scare the typical
Intel Suit away from their computers.  :-)

Message-ID: <45563.127.0.0.1.1088823965.squirrel@www.ultravolt.net>

I?m dabbling in software RAID 0, and found some enlightening howtos to get
me started, but I?m having a problem with the autodetection process. I
managed to find one reference to the problem on google and it didn?t help
me much. I?m hoping someone can point me in the right direction. Here?s
the kernel message output:

I can bring the array up fine manually, but for some reason during boot

CentOS 3.1, and my /etc/raidtab file looks like this:

This sounds like you've built the RAID-0 support as a module and your
kernel doesn't have initrd support. At boot time it attempts to load the
devices, but kernel modules aren't available so it can't deal with it.

So either make use of an initrd, or rebuild your kernel with the RAID-0
support built in.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0407031836480.24990@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  This must look like a broken record. But, I cannot get to the setup page
for the new (arrived yesterday afternoon) Linksys WAP54G. The default IP
address is 192.168.1.254.

  I connected the unit to my notebook with a regular cat5 cable, set eth0:1
on the notebook to 192.168.1.128, and tried pinging the WAP's IP address as
well as loading the Web page. No luck. "Destination Host Unreachable".

  Reset and power cycled the unit. Same results.

  Tried eth0:1 IP addresses of 192.168.1.28 and 192.168.1.208. Same results.

  Removed the regular cable and tried a cross-over cable. Same results.

  Put the WAP on the wireline switch and tried from the notebook. Same
results.

  Go into the den, fire up the ThinkPad and log in: I can ping other hosts
on the LAN as well as external hosts. Ergo, the WAP is working. But, I
cannot configure it.

  Would someone _please_ explain to me what step I've missed here? I want to
set the WAP up with some level of security and know that I can access the
admin page when I want to do so.

  That I have wireless access from a portable but cannot get to the admin
page puzzles and frustrates me. It is beyond my knowledge to know why
there's a problem and what to do about it.

Thanks,

Rich

Just a question.  Which port are you trying to reach the admin page
from?  You need to be on a port that is on the inside net side of your
device.  Cannot come through the device to the internal net.

Ken,

  Which port? I've no idea. All 192.168/16 are internal. My LAN sub-net is
192.168.55/24, that's why I added the 192.168.1/24 sub-net to eth0 on my
notebook.

  Linksys, of course, supports only winduhs. They have a cdrom with their
'setup wizard' on it. That won't play on my linux boxes. I suppose that all
Microsoft networks are, by default, 192.168.1/24 so it's easy to reach the
WAP IP address from a winduhs box.

Thanks,

Rich

When Ken asks "which port", he is asking which physical port on the
Linksys box.  Presumably, this is one of those standard jobs that has a
"WAN" or "broadband" port and (usually) four standard ethernet ports in
addition to the WAN ethernet port.

He is guessing that you can't get to the admin interface through the WAN
port (this is the default configuration for most of those devices).

You wrote earlier that the AP was working... did you try to get to the
admin interface from the wireless connected machine (i.e., the Thinkpad in
the den)?

Also, you might want to see if there's a small documentation problem and
maybe the admin interface defaults to 192.168.1.1 or something.

You could even do something like this:

for a in `seq 1-254`; do ping -c 1 192.168.1.$a; done

Of course, that assumes the thing will respond to a ping on the admin
interface.

As a more general question, is it possible to view the equivalent of the
arp table for a wireless connection?  Or is it all broadcast?

Hey, thanks for that Jeme.  I had not thought of that trick.  But on my
Fedora Core 2 system the dash in the sequence would not work, it had to
be FIRST LAST number in the sequence without the dash as in:
`seq 1 254`;

  No. This is strictly an access point: no hub, no switch, no router. There
are two sockets on the back: one RJ-45 for the network connection to a
switch/hub and one power connection. The BEFW11S4 is a Leatherman(R)-tool
type unit: 4-port hub, WiFi access point, Internet router.

  No. Good idea. I'll try that.

  Both the printed sheet and the embedded pdf manual state that the admin
interface is assigned the default IP address of 192.168.1.254.

  The other units did so I suspect that this one will, too.

  Just tried. No difference. Cannot ping from that unit or access the admin
page via a browser. Tried setting a subnet synonym for eth0 and that did not
elicit a ping response, either.

  This is strange.

Try "nmap 192.168.1.0/24" from both the wired side and the wireless
side.  I seem to recall that some admin pages are accessed through port
88 instead of 80.

Good Luck,

If it is strictly an access point, then it isn't going to bridge your
wireless and wired networks together, which I think is what you want.

All an access point does is connect wireless computers together - think
of it like a switch for wireless networks.

Most of the time, access points with ethernet ports are also wired-
wireless bridges, but not always, I think.  You might google up the
specs for yours and see what it is...

Derek,

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ su -c "nmap 192.168.1.0/24"
Password:

Starting nmap V. 2.54BETA31 ( www.insecure.org/nmap/ )

Nmap run completed -- 256 IP addresses (0 hosts up) scanned in 49 seconds

  IOW, the lights are on but no one's home. Sigh. Equally strange is that
after plugging in the WAP for the above scan, I tried accessing the admin
page with firefox. Instead of immediately seeing "Destination Host
Unreachable", the attempt kept going until it timed out.

  Does any of this make sense?

Thanks,

Rich

Rob,

  The latter is just what the wap54g does. I have difficulty generating a
mental image of how a wireless access points works without being tied to a
network. After all, it is a point of access to ... the network. No?

  Anyway, that's what it's designed to do. See the attached .ps. I don't
know how to get firefox to print a landscape-oriented file so the right side
is truncated. But those missig images are of cat5- and USB-connected hosts
on the LAN.

When you plugged the laptop in to the wureless hub, were you----
 - using a standard cable to go between your wireless hub and your laptop?
 - or did you plug the laptop in to your switch and then the switch in to the 
wireless hub?
 - or were you plugged your laptop in to it, were you using a cross-over 
cable?

Just curious.

Dale,

  Yes.

  All of the above.

  My original message yesterday laid out the tests I ran: notebook->wap via
regular cat5, notebook->wap via cross-over cat5; notebook->wap via lan.
Access attempts via 192.168.1/24 subnet and my network subnet.

  When the intermittent BEFW11S4s were working I could ping them from any
host (naturally) and I could access the admin page from the same subnet to
change its IP address so it was reachable from any host on the lan.

  I see the lights flicker now and then on the WAP, but that's not when any
host (here) is accessing it wirelessly. So there is communications at some
level; that's why mozilla returns "connection refused" sometimes.

  Aggrevating the problem is that Linksys will provide no support for any
network OS other than a flavor out of Redmond.

  Rob wrote about the function and my response with the PostScript file
didn't make it to the list because of size. Here's the pdf version which is

An access point essentially provides the infrastructure to create a
wireless network - it doesn't require a wired network (although most of
the time a wired network will be connected to the wireless network
somehow).

The file didn't come through - but that's a good thing.  You shouldn't
send attachments, especially ones as large as postscript prints usually
are, over mailing lists... post 'em on the web and send a URL to the
list.  :-)

  Well, not to pick nits, Rob, but it has to provide access to _something_.

  Anyway, I took desparate measures ... and they worked! In addition to
describing what I did I'll add my interpretation of why it took these
machinations to get results.

  1.) Fire up VMware. Load supplied cd-rom disk in drive. Wait for autorun
to kick in.

  2.) Up comes the WAP54G setup wizard! I change the IP address to one
that's on my subnet and save the settings. Hoo-ha!

  3.) Try to access the WAP54G using firefox-0.8 on a workstation; won't
accept the default password ("admin"). Hmmm-m-m-m. Fire up opera and point
it to the same IP address. _Now_ it accepts the default password. Change the
password and save the settings. I'm shown that the settings are saved, but I
cannot return to the setup pages (using the "Continue" button). I assume
that's because I need to log in again using the new password.

  4.) Go pack to the virtual desktop running firefox, point it to the new IP
address, leave the username field empty and enter the new password. Et
voila! I'm there!

  5.) Add the two MACs and specify the unit is to allow access from only
those numbers, disable the SSID broadcast and save things.

  Whew! My take on this soggy saga is that the damned unit is hardwired to
work _only_ with Microsoft OSes and browsers. That's why I could not access
it using anything on linux until I changed the IP address to the local
subnet by running the supplied setup application on the virtual win98. And,
in my situation, firefox identifies itself as firefox while opera identifies
itself as IE<something>. I belive that's why I could initially access the
WAP's admin pages using what it thought was a jen-you-whine Microsoft
browser. Once the password was reset it didn't matter any longer.
Considering that Linksys notes on it's home page that its drivers are open
sourced, you'd think they'd make it easier for us to get to the darn
hardware.

  So, back to business: do I add a WEP key (or a key for one of the other
encryption schemes it supports?

Thanks, all of you,

Subject: [PLUG] WiFi -- almost there!
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0407041618420.8989@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I figured out how to work the two interfaces on my Sony when the WiFi card
is plugged in and the cat5 cable is not. I can now ping the local network
hosts, but I cannot ping externally.

  I added a default route using 'route -add' and both 'route -n' and 'netstat
-rn' show the gateway for both eth0 and eth1. As an interesting aside, I see
that ifconfig shows both interfaces up, but only eth1 is running.

  So, the wifi interface (eth1) is up, it has a route and gateway, and I can
navigate wirelessly around the internal lan but not externally. As the
gateway is the same for both interfaces and I have no problems with the
wireline connection I'm puzzled why there's a problem with the wireless.

  On the IBM the wifi interface is working just fine both internally and
externally.

  You folks have been fabulously helpful with this entire sorry mess. I have
one small step left to take: wifi connection to the 'Net. Suggestions
greatly appreciated.

TIA,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] Sound on IBM ThinkPad 600E
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0407041713170.9182@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I need to get the sound running on my finacee's ThinkPad 600E. RealPlayer
works fine, but it's silent.

  According to a couple of google sites, one of which references the other,
the proper driver is cs4232. So, I added that to /etc/modules.conf and told
/etc/rc.d/rc.local to load it upon boot, then I manually loaded it with
modprobe. But, no sound. Also, there's no aumix on that box -- if that makes
any difference.

  One site I mentioned above got it working running Slackware-9.1; same
distribution I installed on the ThinkPad. What I don't know is what else he
has installed that I don't 'cause it ain't workin' here.

  Following found on a SuSE Web site:

# Sound chipset: Multimedia audio controller: Cirrus Logic CS 4610 (rev 01)
# Works with the kernel driver for cs4232 in the emulation mode. No special
settings are necessary to achieve the emulation mode.
# One needs the following lines in /etc/conf.modules

alias char-major-14 cs4232
options cs4232 io=0x530 irq=5 dma=1 dma2=0

to get wav and mp3 file playing working. The driver will not survive an APM
suspend / resume, reload it after an suspend / resume.
# Quality of sound is even better than on my desktop PC.

ALSA of 6.4 (0.5.5+) works with the following modules.conf entries:

alias char-major-14      soundcore
alias char-major-116     snd
alias snd-card-0         snd-card-cs4236
alias sound-slot-0       snd-card-0
alias sound-service-0-0  snd-mixer-oss
alias sound-service-0-1  snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-0-3  snd-pcm-oss
alias sound-service-0-8  snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss

options snd snd_major=116 snd_cards_limit=1
options snd-card-cs4236 snd_index=0 snd_port=0x530 snd_cport=0x538 snd_irq=5
snd_dma1=1 snd_dma2=0 snd_isapnp=0

post-install snd amixer set Master 100% unmute;amixer set PCM 100% unmute;
amixer set Aux,1 100% unmute

Aux,1 is the Channel for CD-in, APM suspend / resume support for the
Thinkpad will be included in future ALSA releases.
Currently do an rcalsasound restart after an suspend / resume cycle.

After editing /etc/modules.conf, be sure to do an depmod -a and then, if you
use ALSA, run rcalsasound restart to load the ALSA driver.
To test ALSA, you can run
aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/whistle.au

or

aplay /usr/share/sounds/wav/applause.wav

if you installed the snd_wav package. If you use alsa, you can use alsamixer
and gamix to setup the channels.

  Do I need alsa as well as the cs4232?

Thanks, folks,

Rich

Message-ID: <40E94E47.5020802@brianquade.net>

I have a server with no monitor so I usually use halt (or shutdown -h) 
to shut it down when I need to.  It shuts down fine with Red Hat 9 and 
Fedora Core 2, but with debian 3.0r2 and slackware 10.0, the hard drives 
sound like they power down but the power supply fan keeps running.  Even 
if I press the power button, it won't shut down (but it does with Red 
Hat and Fedora).  The only way to completely power the machine down 
after running debian and slackware is to hit the reset button and then 
the power button and the whole machine powers down.  I thought it might 
be something in my BIOS power management, but nothing I change in there 
seems to work and Red Hat halt the machine no matter how my BIOS is set 
up.  Does anyone know what the difference could be or how to make this 
work with the GNU distros?

I f you read the documentation card that comes with the unit the default 
IP address on the WAP54G is 192.168.1.245 not 192.168.1.254. I've had a 
version 1.0x of the WAP54G running in my home since May 2003. I also 
setup a newer verson 2.x of the WAP54G a few weeks ago for an apartment 
and that I stay at when I need to be at my company's headquaters and the 
default IP address is still the same.  I can use Mozilla under Linux or 
WinXP to manage the access point. I'm sorry to say my company gave me a 
WinXP laptop and sometimes I still need Windows but I've got SuSE 
Professional 9.0 installed on my laptop and am dual booting at this 
point. I wish I could get my company to pay for VMWare so I didn't have 
to dual boot. Since the laptop isn't mine I'm not going to spend my own 
money outside of the SuSE distro to get the thing to run Linux.

It's just an access point so it doesn't offer DHCP services or 
firewalling but it does provide WPA security using either TKIP or AES 
encryption  that works well with both Linux via the "wpa_supplicant" 
daemon or under WinXP.

Tony,

  I may very well have mis-read the number and consistenly tried the wrong
one. After setting it up with VMware I did a core dump on that memory, but
you may very well have identified my problem.

  So, do I select WPA and flip a coin over the encryption scheme? I suppose
that I put the same series of hex digits in wireless.opts on both portables
and the WAP. Question: that works for use locally but what does it do when
you want to use your portable at a location other than your place? Do public
access points not use any security key (which would seem rational) and
ignore one sent by a remote host?

Thanks,

Rich

Hold the power button in for 10 to 15 seconds.

You probably need to change kernels, I always compile mine from source,
so I don't have a recommendation.

Doing a `modprobe apm` and then running halt /might/ do it. One of the
other kernels Debian offers might have APM built in and be able to do the
soft power off on halt. Otherwise you'll need to build a kernel with APM
or ACPI built into the kernel.

Any idea how you're supposed to accomplish this? Does this mean you can't
do security patches as those require source?

  I believe some motherboards require that the power switch be held a long
time regardless of whether or not apm is available. The portables shut
themselves down (one with apm the other with acpi), but the workstations
don't. On the newest one (running Slackware-9.1) the message is 'system
halted', but I need to hold in the power switch for quite a few seconds
(haven't timed it but it seems like a long time) before it shuts off. For as
infrequently as these machines are turned off it's no big deal. I'd think a
server would be up almost always so it should be a non-issue.

This leaves open-source users no worse off than M$
users, who can't do such things and must rely upon
Bill Gates for redress. But the former are accustomed

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0407051445380.12953@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I just spent a few minutes setting up and configuring my new Netgear
FVS318 firewall/VPN/Barista. It seems too simple! So I would appreciate a
sanity check before I try putting it online to replace the venerable
floppyfw here.

  First, I've no use for the VPN features as I have no other office(s) so I
leave that blank. Similarly, I have no desire to block either of us from
anything on the nasty ol' 'Net so I left that blank, too.

  Second, for incoming services, I assume that I can delete everything but
smtp and dns since I do not run either publicly-available ftp or http
servers. I suppose that leaving them in place exposes me to exploits, just
as if I had them set up in the floppyfw.

  I entered my static, external IP address as well as my ISPs gateway IP
address and netmask. For dns servers I entered the local IP address of my
caching dns here followed by my ISP's #1 dns server.

  After changing the default IP address and password for the box I think
that I did all that needs to be done. Anything obvious that I missed?

  BTW, as soon as this goes live I'll have a floppyfw box (motherboard --
Pentium MMX/200MHz, I believe --, 2 NICs, 2M video card, floppy drive and
64M mixed mode RAM, along with the 14" monitor and keyboard that I'll give
to anyone who wants a firewall. It's served me very well since 1 June 1999
(when they turned on the dsl here) but I can use the space under the desk to
store more dust and dog fur and it will remove one power supply/UPS from the
electrical consumption. Well, I'll keep the UPS for the dsl modem/firewall
appliance.

I normally install apmd or acpid to enable soft power-off.  If it
installs right, you can hit the power button on the box to start a safe
power-off.  Great for non-technical users.

Keith,
 
Pleasure to meet you Saturday night at Jon & Julie's place.  This is
Mike Wold, the across the valley neighbor that was interested in the
Knoppix disk.
 
I have looked around the disk for a bit and liked what I have seen.
Also, have also replaces ie on the both my most used machines with
Firefox.  It works well with the NetSuite accounting program, and so I
am eager to learn more:
 
What would you recommend if I wanted to off the xp bandwagon?  I know
VERY LITTLE about Linux, other than how to spell Linux, and have just
learned that!  I have seen the Sun Java Desktop and been intrigued, but
also Red Hat.  We are a furniture business doing accounting through the
ASP NetSuite and have additional requirements of an Excel type
spreadsheet, word processor, email and a CAD program for cabinet and
furniture design.  Our Amish friends in Ohio use Macdraft on the Mac OS
for cabinet design and if I could use a Linux version of Macdraft that
would be compatable with the Mac version, that would be awesome, but fat
chance of me being so lucky?
 
Anyway, I wanted to thank you for the disk and let you know the seed
found fertile ground over here across the valley.
 
Any tips would be appreciated.  I tried to uninstall ie after using
Firefox, but it's pretty sticky.  The obvious solution is to reformat
and install Linux.
 
Any recommendations would be appreciated,
 
Best regards,

Keith,

  I have only very infrequent use for a CAD program so I've not followed it
lately. However, there was one (whose name I forget) that was a CAD
language, similar to using Gri for scientific plotting or the R statistical
system.

  Anyway, stay away from LinuxCAD. It's a rip-off. Well, at least it was a
rip-off 5+ years ago so I won't slander it directly. But I looked at it and
was very unhappy.

  According to the WineHQ application database, AutoCAD runs on the latest
wine; I don't know how well.

  Cycas <http://www.cycas.de/> looks like it's free for non-commercial use,
but in a limited ability version.

  Given all this, if I needed/wanted a CAD program for furniture design I'd
grab a copy of QCAD <http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue54/frost.html>. It's
gpl'd and looks like it would do just fine. Actually, if I ever again have
time for a life outside of work I might just get a copy for furniture
design.

The md5sum of any rpm in question (at least the handful I tested) 
matched regardless of which machine was performing the md5sum.  When
/bin/rpm got into the act the signatures would be bad on the machine 
accessing the RPM via NFS.  I would get this error message:

Resigning the RPMs on the machine where the RPMs reside on a local 
disk solved the above problem for the remote machine.  root can now 
install those RPMs via NFS.

  I need to add SSH. I specify port 22 for beginning and ending ports,
correct? Is there a need to specify a port > 1024 for the other direction? I
cannot find anything that suggests SSH uses UDP at all. Do I set up that
port for TCP only?

You have only corrected the symptom, not fixed the problem.  There's
clearly something wrong with the NFS implementation.  RPM managed to
prevent it from doing damage by checking its RPMs; you may not be
fortunate with files that do not have built-in check-sums.  I would
recommend at the very least you take great care in transferring files
over the mount.  Then again, if md5sum works correctly, maybe RPM is
doing something unexpected or unsupported with NFS (it could be a
locking issue; I would expect RPM to try to lock the files whereas
md5sum wouldn't).

If you're running an SSH server on the inside of your firewall that you
want to access from outside the firewall, then yes, open port 22/TCP and
give it the IP address of your internal SSH server.  You shouldn't have to
worry about configuring anything that initiates a connection from the
inside to the outside.

Rich,

We ran an FVS318  box in our office for a number of months until we 
outgrew the limited number of VPN tunnels it supported. I will say that 
the VPN support was pretty good and we had VPN tunnels with other FVS318 
appliances, OpenBSD "isakmpd", and FreeS/WAN under Linux. Unless you're 
allowing external access to any services on systems hosted inside the 
LAN side of the firewall there's not really a whole lot to configure on 
this box and so "yes it is that simple". About the only issue we've had 
with these boxes is with Dynamic DNS. It seems that many router 
appliances are poorly behaved in this area and I've had cases where 
DynDNS.org has deleted several of our host names because of repeated 
updates by the FVS318. We were told that we should be running at least 
version 2.3 of the FVS318 firmware by support personnel at DynDNS.org.

I also just setup one of these FVS318 boxes for my apartment near my 
company's headquarters. I like it that it has no fans or disk drives so 
it's totally quiet. and it also gives me a VPN tunnel into the office 
when I need it.  I know this is a Linux message list but the Netgear 
FVS318 is a nice appliance that has an easy to use web-based interface 
and the box just plain works without a whole lot of fuss IMHO.

try qcad, very cross platform

I think the sources are GPL, but the binaries are not, so if you want
support, you pay, but its like $26/year.

http://freshmeat.net/projects/qcad/

http://gnuwin.epfl.ch/apps/qcad/en/

I played with it a while ago and found it usable.

OSS sound (with the cs4232 module) works just fine on my TP 600E. I'm 
running Debian, but I use a vanilla kernel.

By default, all the mixer volumes are muted. So you do need aumix (or 
comparable program) to turn up the volume. Also hit Fn-PgUp a few times. 
Hearing a beep when doing that doesn't mean you have sound working, though.

I never got ALSA working on the ThinkPad. I did try!

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0407061152500.17934@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  To close this thread, I have the WiFi card working now on the Sony 'Black
Perl' notebook with the 3Com 3CRWE154G74 card.

  After a lot of experimentation I discovered that I need to run, as root,
the following two commands:

route add -net 0.0.0.0 gw 192.168.55.4 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth1
route add -net 192.168.55.0 gw 192.168.55.4 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth1

  Then I can ping/connect to both internal hosts and sites on the 'Net. I
cannot explain why the second line is required, but it is.

  What I have not yet tested is what it takes to get a connection when I'm
using an access point external to my office. I may have an opportunity to
try that during my trip to Corvallis this week. I think now that I can
discern and fix any problems that come up at another hot spot.

  Whew! Thanks to everyone who helped,

Rich

Method and apparatus for transmitting power and data using the human body

Abstract

Methods and apparatus for distributing power and data to devices coupled to the
human body are described. The human body is used as a conductive medium, e.g.,
a bus, over which power and/or data is distributed. Power is distributed by
coupling a power source to the human body via a first set of electrodes. One or
more devise to be powered, e.g., peripheral devices, are also coupled to the
human body via additional sets of electrodes. The devices may be, e.g., a
speaker, display, watch, keyboard, etc. A pulsed DC signal or AC signal may be
used as the power source. By using multiple power supply signals of differing
frequencies, different devices can be selectively powered. Digital data and/or
other information signals, e.g., audio signals, can be modulated on the power
signal using frequency and/or amplitude modulation techniques.

IANAL, but I don't believe that's true.  While it's totally contrary to
traditional contract law, it is possible to place software license
agreements inside packaging such that the agreement bonds the owner even
though the owner did not agree at time of purchase.

I believe the original ProFTP case yielded this conclusion, but it may
have been a secondary case.

There was a demonstration of this back in like 1996.  It wasn't Microsoft
who did the demo, but maybe Microsoft bought that company and its
inventions.

The system was pretty simple.  A person wore a small device on a lanyard
around their neck.  The lanyard had small contacts along its surface that
contacted the skin of the neck.  When you shook hands with a person also
wearing that lanyard, you received and sent your "business card" data.  So
at the end of a long day at a conference, you would have the names, email
addresses, phone numbers, businesses and titles of all the people you met
in your little storage device.

It was neat, but easily abused and ultimately pointless.

it may seem ridiculous now, but I bet the idea of a "wearable"  computer
will grow. The super geeks at the MIT Media Lab have been fooling around
with this stuff for a few years now. It's all weird toys now, but's that's
how the PC, the civilian Internet, and even Linux got started. I bet it's
only a matter of time before human bio-interfaces for power and data
storage become practical and then popular. I'm not sure when Hans
Moravec's ideas will become reality, but that reality is coming!

  Who here is an expert in sound on portables?

  I can play sounds using RealPlayer8 when I'm in the office and connected
to the 'Net via cat5 or WiFi. However, when away from the office it's not
working. Silence.

  It appears that all the same sound modules are loaded, but something is
not working. Where do I start looking for the reason for this strange
behavior? I'd like to have some music while I work but I cannot. Sigh. If
it's not one thing it's another, eh?

Message-ID: <20040707135000.11814.qmail@web60805.mail.yahoo.com>

I've a US Robotics external modem that I'm running with Fedora Core 2.  Every once in a while, I
type 

  ifup ppp0

and instead of the normal connection noise, I hear garbage and the modem lights (which I have no
docs for) set into odd patterns and I can't connect.  Subsequent connection attempts usually
return an error message similar to 

  Failed to activate with error 6 (sometimes it's an error 35)

Trying to do

  ifdown ppp0

or 

  /etc/inet.d/network restart

seems to have no effect and I have to reboot the box to clear the error.  ifup has no
documentation and reading through the ifup script provided no clues.  Where can I find a list of
those error codes and, more importantly, how to cope with them?  The "error 6" is more prevelant
and I would love to know how to deal with that.

Cheers,

Have you thought of something a bit easier, like installing a BIOS 
password and ensuring that the main hard drive is above any removable 
media in the boot-priority list? Or will that not do the trick?

The floppy should still work.  Every Intel/AMD system I've worked on
recently have a BIOS setting which allows the user to specify a list
of devices from which the system may boot.  So, if one specifies a
one-item list of "Hard Drive 0" that keeps a malfeasant from booting
from floppy or CD.  And once the box is booted, the drives work just
fine.  Of course, if there is any possibility of the cretins actually
opening the system case, then all bets are off.

Does the headphone jack work when you're on battery? I can't test on 
mine because I don't have a working battery.

Have you tried Suse 9.1-amd64 on your m6809 yet?  I also have one (that
I plan to eventually use with Gentoo), but thought it might be
to try Suse 9.1 on; so I went to Fry's and picked up the boxed set.

While there are some good things...
	there was a 64 bit boot dvd

	the Suse installer can automatically resize a ntfs partition

it has not been a clean install.

The Suse installer is either very slow, or there is some clock freq
problem (maybe the "stuck at 800mhz" problem is still there?)

The Suse installer doesn't handle dhcp network connections correctly.
(It detects dhcp is needed, and starts the client, while the card
is being detected.  Then at the point where it wants to test the
connection and download updates, it tries to start the client a
second time and fails because a client is already running.)

It doesn't have a definition for the 1280x800 m6809 screen size.
(But a 1280x1024 monitor definition, and a 1280x800 desktop size did
the right thing, at least in the test sax2 run).

So far, I haven't gotten through a normal boot; it appears to hang while
generating the host key.  At that time network services aren't up,
virtual consoles aren't enabled, etc. so it's hard to see what's
happening.

At iMove, we're only doing blacklist checks (bl.spamcop.net, list.dsbl.org,
and sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org).  The primary MX server (p5.imoveinc.com) has
been running a rejection rate of ~40% (+-5%) since last February.  The
secondary MX server (p2.imoveinc.com), which should almost *never* be
used, runs with a rejection rate of about 85-90%!  It looks like the SPAM
houses don't honor MX records properly.

Easystreet publishes their statistics here:
   http://support.easystreet.com/spam/stats.html
   http://support.easystreet.com/spam/statistics.gif

A quick summary of their raw number is

So it looks like Rich's quote of 85% is not out of the question.

I *still* get way too many unreadable (Korean and Chinese) spam

FUJI FANTASTIC! What makes a quality digital camera? Many people would
shout out "MEGAPIXELS!" but they'd be wrong. Megapixels are just one
aspect of what makes a good digital camera. You need to also look at the
lens (is it big or small? glass or plastic?), the internal electronics,
the optical zoom and finally, the manufacturer. The Fujifilm FinePix

lens, optical zoom ability, and yes, megapixels. The picture quality is
so good that it runs circles around many competitors' 3 and 4 megapixel

advancements in technology. This FinePix 2800 digital camera features a
2.0 megapixel resolution capturing images up to 1600x1200. Birthday

It's a well established fact that spambots and zombies will 
deliberately deliver mail to a secondary or teriatary MX on the 
assumption that its policies (AV, spam, unknown users) aren't as 
strict as those on the primary MX.

My (unconfirmed) hunch is that many viruses take tactical advantage 
of the situation by

1. Sending infected message to bogus-user at domain-1 via domain-1's
    secondary MX with a forged sender address of real-user at domain-2.
    Since, in all likelihood, domain-1's nonprimary MX hosts don't
    enforce scanning rules, the message will get queued on the
    nonprimary MX

2. When the nonprimary MX tries to pass the message along to its final
    destination, it's rejected/bounced by domain-1's primary MX.

3. So the nonprimary MX must try to return the message as
    undeliverable, but it does so using the (forged) real-user's
    address.

4. Ultimately, real-user gets an infected message that's a) sent by a
    legitimate MX host, so it's not blackholed anywhere along the line
    and b) wrapped in the quasi-official garb of a MAILER-DAEMON
    message. The "official" look of the message might just trick
    unsuspecting lusers into opening a message they might otherwise
    delete with prejudice.

I wonder if Easystreet or other isp's could take nominations for sites
to blacklist; seed.net.tw & hinet.net (and their subdomains)
account for the great majority of the unreadable spam I get.
They're easy to block on a personal level,
but the traffic still keeps coming...

85% is definitely not out of the question. We're running about 93%
at work, not counting whatever leaks through the filters. There's
so much of it that fighting spam has become a performance-tuning
problem as much as a filter-accuracy problem.

Not a good choice.

The camera has three big problems.

1) It has a shutter delay problem.  There is a percievable delay between 
when you hit the shutter release and when it actually takes the picture.  

2) Slow shutter speed.  If the subject is moving AT ALL, you will get a 
blurry picture. It claims you can set the shutter speed.  I have not found 
that setting.

3) Does not focus well in low lighting conditions.  The autofocus needs a 
fair amount of light to work correctly.  That means that if you are 
indoors and it is even the least bit dim, many or all of your shots will 
be out of focus.

I have one of these cameras.  Good for outdoor and high light photos.  
Sucks for everything else.

Only $20 more for twice the mega-pixels than #1. And, #3 seemed about
equal to #2, but cost more.

I have a Fuji digital 2600 with 6x zoom.

I wish I had bought something with a faster reaction time. The lag between 
pushing the button when you see a perfect picture and the camera reacting 
is YEARS.
I have blown hundreds of pictures. Mostly I get a shot of the back of 
someone's head as they turn back to whatever they were doing before the 
flash finally went off. The kiss is over, the puppy moved on, The girl on 
the bicycle was no longer smiling at me, The Amsterdam Street hooker is no 
longer flashing. Damn.

If you just want garden pics they will most likely not turn away from you, 
But real life moves and I am not psychic enough to know how to push the 
button BEFORE the picture happens.

The close up mode is incredible. I have excellent shots of capacitors 
oozing goo and metal popped from its base.

Good luck

Yup, that's the theory. I can confirm that this does happen on my mail 
server for the domain that I'm the the backup MX for.

This also appears to happen.

The best way I've found to stop some of it is to require that all 
inbound mail come from a host that reverse resolves. There are probably 
better ways... SPF records?

Unfortunately, requiring reverse resolving also blocks a bunch of 
legitimate mail from domains that have clueless DNS admins.

It does not have this delay issue if you force it to auto-focus before 
you push the shutter release completely. The delay is caused by the 
auto-focus. Push the shutter release half way, allow the camera to 
focus, and then push the shutter fully to take the pic.

I don't suffer from this at all. I've had blurry pics because I moved 
when there was low light, but then, I should be using a tripod if I 
don't want to use a flash in low light...

I haven't had this problem either. I've taken some amazing pictures of 
the moon, and cityscapes at night and a campfire, without any flash or 
auxiliary lighting. I've also taken some flash pictures in low light 
that were completely amazing too.

BTW, a campfire makes a really cool desktop pic.

Of course, except for possibly the campfire, a flash is totally useless
in those conditions. A flash is for subjects 10-15' away. Years ago in
another (military) life, I laughed at sailors taking night shots of Hong
Kong's cityscape with flash.

I have the following two types of lines:

<tr bgcolor="#EFF5FB">Something here</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#F6F9FC">Who knows what else here</tr>

Is there a way to make a single regex for storing everything between the
tr tags into array elements?  For example, I could do this with two
arrays:

@rows1 = /<tr bgcolor="\#EFF5FB">(.*?)<\/tr>/g;
@rows2 = /<tr bgcolor="\#F6F9FC">(.*?)<\/tr>/g;

But it would be nice if I could do something like this instead:

@rows = /<tr bgcolor="\#(EFF5FB|F6F9FC)">(.*?)<\/tr>/g;

...but without storing EFF5FB and F6F9FC in the array.

Thanks,
~M

Yeah, I took some pics at a recent concert. I was about 20 rows back, 
and was watching people take flash pics. I turned my flash off because I 
knew it was useless at that distance...

Not to mention it calls attention to the person taking the pictures...

Marv,

IMNSHO, take what's behind door# 2...

    Olympus D-565 Zoom (225410)

I've been pleased with my Olympus D-490Z. You can see photos taken with
it at:

    http://herring.org/albums/Elisha/

For the purposes you've outlined, I think you'll be quite happy with the
565. In a previous life, I was a freelance photographer. I'm now in the
process of eBaying all of my 25 year old Leica and Nikon equipment and
will soon have the Nikon D70 for which I lust *drool*.

cheers,
Sandy

Sorry, I should have been more clear.  There are other tr tags with
different values for bgcolor.  I just want the two listed above.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0407071616510.23666-100000@www.fnordora.org>

The place I am currently working has inherited a couple of VA Linux dual 
proc 2U rackmount server boxes.

Linux installs on it (with a bit of whacking on the install (acpi=force)).

My question is if anyone is familiar with that style of rackmount box.  It 
has space for a couple of drive bays.  There are big fans there now.

Where do I get the drive bays/mounting hardware?  After putting a DVD 
drive in the box, there is no place to put in a drive.

VA Linux does not do hardware and they do not seem to have any info on 
those boxes.

i have not found anything on Google other than a picture of the system 
with the drive mounts installed.

Ideas? Info?

California Digital bought VA's hardware line.  Check with them.

Whoh...  that's a new one for me.  I understand the "ternary conditional"
to work like this (example from the perlop man page):

$a = $ok ? $b : $c;

But I don't understand why it works in your example...

I think they're talking about what the filters catch, not the junk that
gets through. My Procmail filters catch about 110 spams a day to me
personally (down from 170 a day earlier in the year.) Out of the 50 or so
per day that should get through to me (mostly mailing list traffic) maybe
5-10 (10-20%) are junk that still gets through.

Using regexen to parse HTML will bite you in booty eventually. Here's 
the better way to do it. Note: you'll need to install HTML::TreeBuilder 
from CPAN ( i.e. sudo perl -MCPAN -e'install HTML::TreeBuilder' )

Here's a more flexible way to do it:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w

use strict;
use HTML::TreeBuilder;
use Test::More tests => 1;

my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder->new;

undef $/;  # read DATA all at once
$tree->parse( <DATA> );

# Find the tags with these two bgcolors.
# This method comes from HTML::Element.
# Another handy HTML::Element method is
# find_by_tag_name().
my @tr = $tree->look_down(
   _tag    => 'tr',
   bgcolor => qr/ eff5fb | f6f9fc /xi,
);

# Now check that we found "foo", "bar", "baz",
# but not "skip".
#
# First extract the text from the tags
# e.g. <tag>text</tag>
my @tags = map { $_->as_text } @tr;

# Now compare what we got with what we should
# have gotten and print "ok" or "not ok".
is_deeply
   [ @tags ],
   [ qw/foo bar baz/ ],
   "Found the expected tags";

__DATA__
<head>
   <title>test</title>
</head>
<body>
   <table>
     <tr bgcolor="#EFF5FB">foo</tr>
     <tr bgcolor="#F6F9FC">bar</tr>
     <tr bgcolor="#000">skip</tr>
     <tr class="multiline_with_td"
         bgcolor="#F6F9FC"><td>baz</td></tr>
   </table>
</body>


-Joshua

PS HTML::TreeBuilder is a subclass of both HTML::Element and 
HTML::Parser, so you get all of their method for free. That's a lot of 
documentation to read. To get you started, check these three out: 
HTML::Parser::parse_file(), HTML::Element::look_down(), and 
HTML::Element::find_by_tag_name() .

PPS Read David Cross' "Data Munging with Perl" to learn why using 
regexen is a weak approach to HTML parsing.

Evan,

  I've no idea. I don't have headphones with me when I travel (except for
the cell phone) and haven't looked for a socket on the box. Interesting
idea, though.

  If I plug in the unit the sound works.

Thanks,

Rich

It's not the ternary operator - it's part of an extended regular 
expression pattern. 'man perlre', grep for '?:pattern'.

This was more of a comment on the draw back to using a cage to limit

So, everyone recieves the same amount of spam as you do? It may be true 
that they are counting denied emails (i.e. 5xx responses) too.. but not 
necessarily.
Do you post to usenet? That makes a huge difference. Publically 
advertising your email on any website that's semi-popular will get you a 
lot more spam.

Actual spam identified on my server is normally around 20-25%. Certianly 
more than 5%, but I'm pretty sure I know smtp quite well. If I counted 
5xx vs. 250 responses.. wow, that would be about 80% of all email, at 
least. I see about 5-20 dictionary attacks per day :(

Matt,

Backing up a step, can you explain what problem you're trying to solve?  Storing tr tags in an
array sounds like you are using this to solve some larger problem.  If you can explain the larger
problem, maybe we can come up with a cleaner way of solving it.

There are programs and whatnot that are not GPL, but Linux itself
doesn't have this problem.  SCO's version might.  Noone can buy
GPL software out and restrict it.  Maybe new versions of GPL
programs can be restricted, but that wouldn't stop the GPL'ed
ancestor from being improved without the restrictions.

I'm more concerned about Redhat moving to a high cost Linux
product and discontinuing software for non corporate customers.  
I don't see how using the public as guinea pigs is going to make
Linux more popular.  It's sad that the discussions leading to
Redhat's restructuring and why they dumped alpha too are
not public knowledge as far as I know.

VA2230s or some such?  OSDL had a bunch of 'em when I worked there.

You've prolly got an Intel Lancewood motherboard.  Check the numbers
inside and look online for BIOS upgrades.  The serial console and remote
management support is kinda nifty.

Yeah.  It's kind of a hassle.  There's a trick to getting the front
cover and fans off so you can get to those bays, can't remember it
without looking at the box and/or knowing the model#.

California Digital.  They sell VA parts and support contracts that are
handled by script-readers in Bangalore.*

And yes, unfortunately, the VA 2U cases are custom as far as I know.


Let me know if you need another pair of eyes on the thing,

OK, this is dumb.

I have here a brand new 3GHz P4 processor, a brand new motherboard with
800MHz FSB or some ungodly number, and a stick of DDR-400 PC3200 RAM.

I plug all this stuff together in the appropriate configuration and no-go.
I disconnect the ATX2 connector (the four pin thingie that seems to power
the CPU alone) and the CPU fan spins when the power comes on, but no
little post beep.

Turns out the power supply is only 250W, so we replace it... thinking
we're overloading the thing (understand, this is without any devices
beyond an AGP card and keyboard -- no drives or anything.

We have a new 350W power supply.  Exact same results.

What gives?

Try removing the RAM and video and see if you get three beeps on
powerup.  Add RAM and see if you get 8 beeps.  If not, CPU and/or mobo
is likely DOA.  

Hope you bought it locally,

Well, that 800MHz isn't really a true 800MHz if that makes you feel any
better.

Does the CPU fan spin with the Pentium4 power cable plugged in?

Well, the things that pop in to my head as possibilities are:

1)  The motherboard is shorting
2)  The PSU is bad
3)  The RAM is bad
4)  The CPU is bad
5)  The motherboard is bad
6)  The video card is bad
7)  The video card/RAM/CPU is improperly seated
8)  Some component isn't compatible with some other component

Now, when I have a system that is dead like that, I disassemble the
whole thing and place the motherboard on a piece of cardboard (it can't
short out on cardboard, can it?).  Plug in the CPU (and heatsink, of
course), RAM, and video card.  Make sure they're all properly seated.
Plug the power cable(s) in to the board.  Power it up (short the power
button pins with a screwdriver) and see what happens.

If it doesn't power up, you should swap out components until it does
power up to identify the defective/incompatible component.

Hello all,

I'm shopping for a wireless card for my IBM Thinkpad 600e to work with
linux Fedora Core 1.  I would like to know if I should go PCMCIA or
perhaps USB.  Is there a card manf. that anyone recommends to go with
or stay away from?

I see Fry's has an SMC protocol G/B on sale that I would like to buy
as I would like G/B.

Thanks for the suggestions,

Josh

  This is an older unit with a 16-bit pcmcia bus. The Lucent/Orinoco Gold
card worked immediately when I plugged it in to my fiancee's 600E.

  What you do with Fedora I can no longer tell you. But, we've Slackware-9.1
running on that box and everyone's happy.

Well that's better than a sheet of plastic, but still a source of static
electricity. An anti-static mat with wrist strap would be the best
choice. ESD damage often results in latent component failures, rather
than failing immediately.

I was actually told to use cardboard by a senior repair tech a few years
back and haven't lost a board to ESD yet.  :-)

I suppose if the weather were drier and you hit the thing just right, it
could become an issue.  But, IME, if you're using a wrist strap or
similar in Oregon, cardboard is safe.

What's wrong with a providing a bleeding edge distribution that is free of
cost to anybody who wants to use it? I wouldn't use Fedora in any kind of
production server environment but I use it on my desktop. If by using the
data received from the Fedora distro helps them create and maintain a
stable corporate solution that they can sell to make a profit then more
power to them.

I thought it was "moved", not "moving".

Um, they are a company. If you want a distribution where everything is
out in the open and nearly everybody has input, you need Debian. And
witness how everything takes months to accomplish. (Disclaimer: I do
actually use Debian.)

So, BTW, in reference to my first comment -- is Fedora controlled at
all by RedHat? I thought the answer was no, but I'd like to correct my
little knowledge base.

Run unstable/testing?

Try http://www.backports.org/ ?

It's always been pretty straightforward for me the few times I've
played around.

1) G is a marketing gimmick.  Unless you really feel the need to move
streaming video from a computer within your premises, or you are doing
major backup file transfers with the wrong software,  then 54Mbps
provides no advantage over 11Mbps.  The pipe into your house is likely
less than 3Mbps.  OTOH, G uses a higher frequency and is far more
sensitive to loss of range and multipath.  

2) Assume most cheap wireless cards don't work with Linux.  There are
rare exceptions.  Think "winmodem", only this time it is "winradio".
Unless you know a specific box contains a specific model number, your
chances of success are probably 5%.  We've seen this over and over here;
the process always consists of

   [A]  "buy a card at Fry's", "determine chipset", "look for drivers",
        "find none", "ask for help on PLUG list", "receive ridicule"
   [B]  go to [A], repeat until clue appears
   [C]  do research and find card known to work.

3) Assuming you are too busy to make frequent visits to Fry's,  may
I suggest you purchase a known-to-work chipset and card.  802.11B
Orinoco cards are good, as is anything with a Prism2 'B chipset. 
For B/G, (assuming that restricted range is OK) the Atheros chipset
is said to have rapidly developing wifi drivers ("madwifi").   Note
that the big vendors (Linksys, D-link, etc) change chipsets like
Imelda Marcos changed shoes, so the same model number can be
associated with three or four chipsets (and only one may be Linux
compatable).

4) I strongly suggest 200mW Prism2 cards, such as the "Engenius"
AKA "Senao" cards.  They are often rebranded.  You can purchase
these from Rick at Invictus Networks in Lake Oswego, or from Netgate
in Spokane, or from numerous other mail order shops.  There are good
lists of cards and vendors at the Seattle Wireless website.

Wireless for Linux is a minefield.  For all sorts of bogus and non-bogus
reasons, there are relatively few drivers available for the cheap stuff.
That does not mean you can't find something that works, just that you
cannot find something randomly (Fry's is randomly).  

I am the king of the scrounges, but this is one place where I will spend
$90 for quality and easy install, compared to $30 for something that
doesn't work (again and again and again).

G is the same frequency as B; just a different signal encoding
mechanism.  802.11A is the higher frequency standard.

Subject: [PLUG] qpopper and PAM
Message-ID: <20040709025748.GH1028@merlot.com>

I'm trying to get qpopper working with PAM, and not only is there no
meaty doc on the web, it's a real pain to debug.

My goal is to have a POP3 daemon that can run from inetd or standalone,
TLS-capable, and can use MySQL for authentication (through PAM or any
other way). And it has to grok mailboxes. 

I have pam-mysql set up, but I can't get qpopper-drac (apt-get -b source
qpopper) to ask PAM about authentication. I've tried telnetting to the
port then attaching strace to the process and running it all standalone;
it loads the pam shared lib, but never asks it anything.

I set 'pam_warn.so' in /etc/pam.d/other and removed all of the
pop-related files in that directory; no warning was logged.

Am I missing some configuration line or something? Is there an easier
way to do authentication out of MySQL for a mailbox-reading POP daemon? 

Thanks.

This is due to the undefined monitor. I *wish* there was a driver for
this beautiful display, but there isn't. Here's what has worked pretty
well for me:

HorizSync   32 - 38
VertRefresh 50 - 70
Option      "dpms"
Driver      "radeon"
Depth       24
Modes       "1280x800"
Xdimension  332mm
Ydimension  208mm

Hope this helps.

This has been crazy making for me, but with Aaron Burt's help today, we
figured out (we think) that the hardware is getting into some weird
state. Booting off Knoppix26 with noapm or Morphix with noapm nopcmcia a
couple of times causes stuff to work again. We do *not* understand this
(maybe Aaron has figured it out after he left, but I'm still scratching
my head).

Also, the simple act of just plugging in an Intel wireless card caused
it to completely forget about anything to do with eth0. Basically,
something is getting fired off that clobbers the configuration.

Aaron, you want to drop some pearls of wisdom into this conversation?

I do have mine working. Pretty much. When its going well, it is one
honking machine and I think SuSE is the way to go for AMD64. And I say
that after many years of using Mandrake and plunking down my (very) hard
earned bucks for a Mandrakeclub Silver Membership. I think I'm going to
ask for my money back on the Silver upgrade - MDKAMD64 just will not run
on the M6809, period.

Good luck and keep us posted on your progress!

Dave is correct.  I had seen some graphs of measured range data for
B and for G, that showed lower range for G.  However, further research
shows that G does have higher theoretical range.  G breaks the radio
spectrum up into a lot of little subbands (Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiplexing, or OFDM) which means the symbols in each
subband are transmitted more slowly.  The longer the symbols, the less
likely they are to interfere with each other as they take longer and
shorter paths in an environment with multiple radio-reflective surfaces.

OTOH, with multiple frequencies it is possible to get something called
"third order intermodulation", where two signals at nearby frequencies
can mix together and produce a third frequency.  To prevent this, the
electronics in the transmitter and receiver have to be well designed
and carefully tested to prevent the distortions that can result in
intermodulation.  So, G (best case) works better than B (best case).
Perhaps the graphs I had seen were for less-than-ideal cards.  Or 
perhaps I am imagining those graphs (a mind is a terrible thing).

In time, G cards and infrastructure will be more common.  For now,
almost all public wifi sites are B, and typically have less than
3Mbps backhaul to the net.  So for most practical purposes, either
B or G will do.  For Linux purposes, use what you are sure you can
find production drivers for.

Not quite your setup, but I have Debian unstable running on a 600e using a 
Linksys WUSB11v2.6 USB adapter.  Getting it to work was fairly painless, 
though I did end up using a different driver 
(http://at76c503a.berlios.de/) than the one that Debian wanted to use.

USB can also be done, but the chances of finding one that works with no
hassles is smaller than for PCMCIA cards.  The advantage is that they
usually come with a USB cord, so you can move the device around to find
the best signal (almost like having an antenna).

The research to find out the exact chipset is worth it.

What is the Northbridge chipset?  What is the brand and CS level of the
RAM?  Most of the chipsets that drive the bus at 800 MHz are dual
channel on the RAM bus.  Not that one stick shouldn't work, but two
sticks will make your memory access even faster.  They tend to be kind
of picky about the CS level of the RAM, too.

Check the list of servers, you probably need to add and/or delete where
the packages are coming from (/etc/apt/source.list).  I know that
Evolution is in both testing and unstable.

Subject: [PLUG] Example of existence/non-existence of wireless drivers
Message-ID: <20040709172400.GB584@gate.kl-ic.com>

Look at the following webpage for an example of better-than-average
support for wireless cards:

http://support.dlink.com/faq/view.asp?prod_id=357

Things to note while purusing this DLINK "support" page:

1) On a typical card, the DWL-520, there are three different chipsets.
One set is PRISM-II, with good drivers (though the hostap drivers are
better than the suggested wlan-ng drivers), one chipset is ADMTEK, 
and the pointer is to a Chinese 404 page, and one chipset is REALTEK,
with pointers to drivers for the 2.4.18 and 2.4.20 kernels only.  If
you are running FC1 (2.4.22-1.2115) you are SOL.

2) Many of the cards have no drivers at all, or alpha drivers.  Alpha
means that the driver can panic the kernel or go gunnysack in some 
other way.  These drivers will mature in time (I have great hopes 
for the Atheros ) but in the beginning, you are contributing debugging
to the project.

3) You will probably be unable to tell card revision by looking at
the box.  Fry's sells manufacturer's refurbs packaged as new, so you
cannot assume the units on their shelf are the latest rev, or even
all the same in the same box.

4) Examples of G cards that have linux drivers are the DLINK G120
(rev A and B) and the G650 (rev A) using the Prism54 chipset (drivers
are in alpha), and the G520 (rev A and B) and the G650 (rev B and C)
using the Atheros chipset (with Madwifi drivers in beta).  Are we
confused yet?

SMC doesn't even mention Linux for their wireless cards,  though 
there is some offsite information.  You will note that the card
they show on their splash page is cardbus, which will not work in
older laptops.  

Again, it is better to start with chipsets and drivers you have heard
good things about, determine an adequate form factor and interface
(Cardbus vs PCMCIA) then work backwards to identify the card and
revision that you want to buy.   Think minefield;  without a good
map through it, you will get blown up.  The FCC designed the mines,
Bill Gates made them, the manufacturers placed them, and Fry's will
parachute you into the middle of them, in the dark.  That is not the
way it should be, and for most Linux peripherals it is not, but wifi
is scary that way.

  I have an Orinoco Gold (B only) card in a laptop running FC1 that I'm very
happy with.  It seems to work better than most of the cards out there.  It
also has an external antenna jack if your location needs a little extra gain
or even a can'tenna.  

  I've loaned out the card a couple of times to people who couldn't get
other WiFi cards to work at their location.  The Orinoco Gold card has
worked fine.  

  I also have a Linksys WPC11 that ran flaky under FC1.  It used to lose
it's connection to the WAP on random occasions.  It took a reboot to clear
the condition.  I don't recommend using the Linksys with FC1.  I only use
that card in my (work) Windows laptop these days.

The SeattleWireless Hardware Comparison is a great resource.  
http://www.seattlewireless.net/index.cgi/HardwareComparison

  I recently picked up a D-Link B/G WAP and a B/G PCI card based on the
SeattleWireless page and other info.  I'm not going to bother replacing my
PCMCIA card.  The throughput of 802.11B is OK for general web surfing.  

  The  D-Link WAP seems to work OK.  I haven't had a chance to fire up the
PCI card yet.

North Bridge is Intel 865PE

It's a pretty cheap board (not mine)... I found a decent review here:

When did things get so complex?

I don't know much about the RAM... the little plastic box from which I
unpacked it says PQI Corporation  256MB DDR-400.

I took the motherboard out of the case and connected just the CPU and the
power supply.  I shorted the PS pins with a screwdriver and get the same
results.

A slight fan twitch with both power connectors on the motherboard, full
CPU fan motion (but no beeps) when only the ATX1 connector is attached.

Fudge.

It's in stable as well... at least according to my server's apt-cache.

IME, testing components by actually removing them isn't very reliable -
different boards handle these things differently.

The *necessary* components for a system to fire up are the CPU, RAM,
video card, and PSU, generally speaking.  Depending on the motherboard,
a video card may not be necessary and a CPU fan may be necessary.  I'm
sure there are other exceptions.

Will the power supply come up with the CPU removed?

Weird, OK.

Here's what happened:

I took off the CPU sink/fan and set it aside (still with power connected
to the header on the motherboard).  I then removed the CPU (leaving the
CPU power connector connected).

Powerup was the same as with the CPU in and the ATX2 NOT connected.  Power
supply and CPU fan come up.

So I reseated the CPU and got the same results... So something has changed
(though I can't imagine what) just in reseating the CPU.

Still no post, though... added RAM and video, same.

WRONG, G uses the same frequency as B.  I just uses a different encoding
scheme and will fall back to B if the signal quality is poor.

I had an old board that wouldn't post unless the CMOS battery was 
functioning. But a dead battery on a new board sounds unlikely.

Message-ID: <20040710003925.GA2991@gate.kl-ic.com>

FYI, I saw Ed Sawicki briefly at the Biznix meeting last night; he was
there to open the doors and then leave for urgent  business. 

It seems that neighbors were careless with fireworks on Sunday, and the
resulting roof fire burned down his house (taking out his servers).  

Ed has been a great contributor to the local Linux community, and the
sooner he gets back on his feet, the sooner his contributions will
resume.  He doesn't seem like the sort of person that asks for help,
but perhaps we can help in various ways if we offer the help sincerely
enough.

Continuing....

After the initial problems I had with Suse 9.1 amd64, I decided to try a
32 bit experiment using gentoo 2004.1.

Everything was initially fine.  Switching to kernel version 2.6.7 even
solved the acpi problems that forced the initial install (using kernel
2.4.25) to use the parameters "pci=noacpi noapic".

But X windows only runs a few seconds before freezing... (e.g. display
no longer updates; mouse no longer moves).  You can still log in across
the network.  The X server is in an infinite loop; the system log has
the message...

CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000004
Bank 4: b200000000070f0f
Kernel panic: CPU context corrupt

which means memory might be suspect.  I ran one pass of memtest86; it
didn't find any problems.  Probably should run it longer...

If you have a voltmeter, try to measure all of the supplies.
Alternatively, trying hooking up just the power cable to a sacrificial
disk drive.  If it spins up the +5 and +12 supplies are probably good.
Of course if the CPU fan runs the +12 is likely to be okay.  You could
also try hooking up a keyboard and seeing what the LEDs do.

I think the CMOS reset is a good idea, though I'll be surprised if
it cures the problem.

One other thing is to make sure the reset switch isn't shorted.

  Oh, good grief! That's what scares me about the morons around here, too. I
encourage them to set off their fireworks in their own houses but they
insist on using the street and the park behind our houses.

 Ed's been extra helpful to us all. What can we do -- individually and
collectively -- to help? I've no idea how to contact him so if you'll
coordinate, count me in to assist.

Hmm.  I did a / search in aptitude and it wasn't found.  Apparently

Well, I wouldn't be so sure about that. I have noticed very consistently
that there is stuff in the cache that Aptitude doesn't see. I have *no*
idea why, but this has happened several times. Of all the different
graphical package managers I have used on quite a few different distros,
I really like Aptitude the best by far. But...

I wonder if "Bank 4" could be video memory; the motherboard 512mb is
bank 0 and bank 1.  The motherboard memory got through a 16 hour 75
pass memtest86 run with flying colors.

The error might also be video driver related.

After a quick google search, there is another report of a 32 bit
immediate X server freeze on the m6809; that person never tried to
come in via the network to check logfiles after the freeze though.
He said his freeze was fixed by playing around with noacpi, etc.
boot parameters.  So far that doesn't help for me... I'm going to
try xorg (instead of xfree) to see what happens.  I may also go
back soon to 64bit experiments.

I also did some research on the Broadcom wireless chip in the m6809.
There shouldn't be any difficulty getting it running in 32bit mode
using the windows driver and either ndiswrapper or linuxant. 64bit
mode will be harder.  There's a short thread on a kernel mailing list
that basically says...

	it might be possible with a LOT of work to use the 32bit
ndiswrapper in a 64bit kernel by putting it in the same memory segment
as the boot/shutdown code.  But you'd have to write a big glue layer
to translate between 32bit mode, and the 64bit calls in the rest of
the kernel.

	you can't just recompile ndiswrapper with the amd64 compiler,
and then use a 64bit windows drivers (whenever they are created).
Microsoft apparently changed the ndis driver model for windows64
(which might be part of the reason why windows64 is so slow in coming
out, and has so few drivers).  The summary was that you'd have to
write a whole new "ndiswrapper" to work with windows64 ndis drivers.

There was also a comment in one mailing list that at least broadcom
chip might work with the prism54 driver, but the response to that was
skepticism.

  I run a small network which is used as a means to an end. What might the

are the advantages (e.g., stability?) of the 2.4 series over the 2.6 series.

Supposedly 2.6 offers significantly better "desktop interactivity"
under load, which could mean a lot for you, if I understand correctly.

Um. Just that. Uh. Like, say, you start a big file copy or something
on your hard drive -- how would you like it if you could keep using
(as an example) Evolution or Mozilla without a hiccup (relatively
speaking)?

Lower latency, so it's more responsive.  More and better drivers.  Many
of the network drivers handle high loads with less CPU time.  

The advantages in 2.6 mainly show on hot new hardware, desktop systems
and high-performance servers.

I've been using 2.6 for awhile, and the biggest difference I have found is
that 2.6 offers better disk I/O handling, better swapping, and other
performance enhancers.  2.6 is very sweet and I use it for my home
workstation and can notice a big speed difference.  However, my server I
run 2.4 because it is more stable right now than I've found 2.6 to be.

  Oh. I've not seen (or heard) any hiccups even on my ol' Red Hat 7.3 box
running on a PII/333MHz processor.

  However, as I'm going to be doing a lot of model building with
Eclipse/EMF/UML and java, speeding things up will be useful. Guess I'll go
with the 2.6.7 kernel when I get to upgrading boxes here.

Many thanks,

  Ah! I thought that's what I read: performance vs. stability. Well, I have
to reneg on what I just wrote in response to Chris' message. I need
stability more than I need performance. After all, I run my business on
these boxes so uptime and stability is more important than heating the
office with blazing speed.

  My thanks to you and Chris, Jason!

Aaron,

  What I consider "hot, new" hardware is probably forgotten by many. I've an
Athlon+-2100 that's 6 times faster than my current system. I need to get the
VMware guest running on it before it takes over as my main machine. My
new-ish portable is the Sony Vaio PCG-V505BC that -- reluctantly -- replaced
my Toshiba Portege 3025CT.

  I've deliberately moved far back from the bleeding edge in hardware and
software because nothing I do requires tettering there. I spend most of my
professional time writing -- and speaking on the telephone -- with the
occasional bout of frantic number crunching thrown in for excitment.

Thanks,

Rich

I have to second all the postings about performance improvement.
I upgraded all 4 boxes that I between home and work.  All of the are using
either 2.6.5 or 2.6.6 and it has significant performance improvement over 
2.4.x.

I use one of the box at home to view movies and that has the most noticable
performance improvement.

I did have problems with Fedora 2/2.6.5/XFree 86/Nvidia Quattro problem
in that this combination cannot fire up X successfully.  I moved to X.org
and everything works just fine.
My other boxes have older video cards and 2.6.x kernel ran just fine.

FWIW, I'm running 2.6.3 on my server right now with a 134 day uptime and
no hiccups at all during that time period.  That uptime is going to be
cut pretty soon as I'm planning hardware upgrades... but the kernel is
solid.  I had a 100 day uptime on my workstation (also 2.6.3) but power
outages killed that.  No UPS for the workstation (hey, what can I say?
I'm a cheap bastard.)

I have been playing around with Yoper Linux lately and now that I have 
upgraded to the 2.6.7 kernel it is unable to find my CDRW/dvd combo drive.  I 
have dug around and been unable to find any reference to this problem.  It 
does not seem to exist even to hdparm.  This is a very recent issue and I am 
stumped.  I did not have this issue with the 2.6.6 kernel under FC2 or 
Gentoo.  No I do not want to go back to using ide-scsi, if that is the only 
solution I will just change distros.  Any shots with a clue bat would be 
greatly appreciated.

Using xorg instead of xfree solved the hang; at least in 32bit mode the
display appears to be working fine.

I've also got the Broadcom wireless card working with ndiswrapper.

Now to start experimenting again with 64bit mode in the other partition.

I believe it means that the network interface has a MII (media independent 
interface) and you would have to provide the transceiver part of the 
interface.  I first saw this on cisco equipment about 8 years ago but so 
far not on pc motherboards.  The MII allows to have ethernet on copper or 
ethernet on fiber or whatever media type.  My feeling is, it would be be 
good to steer clear of such motherboards and make sure they have a RJ-45 
connector.

It looks like it is the electronic interface that provides the Physical
link to the rest of the network interface.

http://www.davicom.com.tw/big5/download/Data%20Sheet/DM9000_Application_Notes_Ver_1_22%20061104.pdf

This link has a diagram showing one manufacturers interpretation of the
interface.

Folks:

Thank you all for the comments you gave me on my first draft
for a procedure to install and configure an email and
calendering infrastructure.

I have made some revisions to the procedure and have posted
it on my web site.

You are welcome to use this as you see fit. It does include
Postfix/Courier with LDAP authentication. It also allows for
setting up virtual accounts (no entries in the local system
passwd file). It also is integrated with Spamassassin and
Mailman.

The procedure is on www.allyn.com with a link toward the bottom
of the page, or you can go directly to www.allyn.com/new_mail.html

If any of you have a chance, can you please take a peek at this and
provide me with any more criticism or comments for anything that
is wrong or you feel is left out that is important?

Thank you very much

Mark Allyn

Did they ever fix IDE-SCSI in 2.6?

2.6.7 has an off-by-one bug in the AGPGART code that has various effects
on PCI stuff:

http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0406.2/0391.html

I think the -mm patches have a fix for it, too.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0407111846210.11220@neon.netpro.to>

I'm trying to configure a Fedora 2 box to accept dialup modem connections.
When I call in the phone just rings and rings and rings...
I have the Comtrol RocketModem II installed.  lsmod shows the rocket
module loaded.  dmesg shows the corresponding tty's being created:
/dev/ttyR0 - /dev/ttyR5

I've added the following lines to inittab:

R0:2345:respawn:/sbin/mgetty ttyR0 -m '"" AT&F OK' -D -x9 -s 115200 ttyR0
R1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mgetty ttyR1 -m '"" AT&F OK' -D -x9 -s 115200 ttyR1
R2:2345:respawn:/sbin/mgetty ttyR2 -m '"" AT&F OK' -D -x9 -s 115200 ttyR2

R4:2345:respawn:/sbin/mgetty ttyR4 -m '"" AT&F OK' -D -x9 -s 115200 ttyR4
R5:2345:respawn:/sbin/mgetty ttyR5 -m '"" AT&F OK' -D -x9 -s 115200 ttyR5

/etc/mgetty+sendfax/login.config has the following added:

/AutoPPP/ -     a_ppp   /usr/sbin/pppd auth -chap +pap login debug modem crtscts proxyarp lock ms-dns 4.2.2.4


/etc/ppp/pap-secrets has the following:

testuser * mypassword 172.16.1.50


testuser also exists as a regular user on the system.

I ran "telinit q" and the mgetty processes show up in the ps output.

"stty -a < /dev/ttyR0" shows the modem port is functioning.

/var/log/messages is filled with lines like this:

Jul 11 18:56:44 dialup mgetty[3154]: init chat failed, exiting...: Interrupted system call

/var/log/mgetty.log.ttyR0 has messages like this:

Message-ID: <200407120026.26486.romanmir@comcast.net>

	I'm looking to slurp the McMenamins's movie page once a week, and parse that 
into a webpage along the lines of what I have attached.

	The rule that was used for the attached page was as follows:
using http://www.mcmenamins.com/index.php?type=theater as fodder, I was able 
to find a section that would be very parsable. It would look for the first 
"<strong>" tag and then take the next three "<br>" tags. 
 That could then be piped into an HTML document. for calling up every morning/ 
every week. 

The downside is that I have zero experience in PERL. I was hoping that 
something could be created that I could reverse engineer so I could get my 
feet wet in PERL.

Any takers?

Are you looking for "Perl" perhaps?  There's no such thing as "PERL",
as far as I know, unless someone has invented something recently to
fill that niche.

As for parsing that page with Perl, take a look at the HTML::Parser
module, or in particular, the HTML::TableExtract module.  You can
look at the documentation for those with "perldoc $modulename" if they're
installed, or by searching for those names in the box at search.cpan.org.

If you need a good book to start learning Perl, I'd suggest my book of
the same name, "Learning Perl", followed by "Learning Perl Objects
References and Modules" for larger programs.  If you want those same
books presented live, we offer local 4-day intensives at OGI
(cpd.ogi.edu).  Looks like the next two classes are the weeks of 8/24
and 8/30.

I have the PDF plugin for Mozilla directly from Adobe and get errors about
features not avaliable and then missing fonts which make this mostly
un-usable from my Linux box.  I'll try from the Windows system at work

Just glancing at it suggests that similar functionality in Perl is quick 'n easy:

  use HTML::TokeParser::Simple;
  my %bad_tag       = (
    applet => 1,
    script => 1,
    font   => 1,
  );
  my @bad_attribute = qw/onclick onfocus onblur/;

  my $parser = HTML::TokeParser::Simple->new(shift @ARGV); # get filename from command line

  my $new_html = '';
  while (my $token = $parser->get_token) {
    next if $bad_tag{ $token->return_tag };
    $token->delete_attr($_) foreach @bad_attribute;
    $new_html .= $token->as_is;
  }
  print $new_html;

  Does anyone have a suggestion how I can test the serial port on the rear
of an IBM ThinkPad 600E? We cannot sync the Handspring on it and everything
works just fine on a workstation.

  Permissions, /dev/pilot, everything else seems to be fine but there's no
communications even using pilot-xfer.

Thanks,

I'll typically use another computer and a null-modem and then run
minicom on both ends and see if I can type to the other guy and
vice-versa. More sophisticated toy boxes exist, I'm sure, though.

Null-modem cable to another PC and a terminal program on each end.
(Minicom in Linux, HyperTerminal in Windows.) I have a spare null-modem
or two kicking around if you need one.

Is the PPP module loaded?  Maybe something like that is locking the
port.  I recently had to figure out that you have to unload LP before
loading the PP networking module.

Chris,

  What I did was download and build photopc then tried to query the digital
camera. Same port failure message I get on my workstation if I forget to
change the serial port switch box.

  Guess it's dead.

  Fortunately, the 600E has both IR and USB ports; I'm hoping the latter
works.

Thanks,

Rich

No, it could still be that the application can't communicate with it
because it's being held open by something else.

Jeme,

  Could be. The only open applications are a couple of virtual terminals and
jpilot. Suggestions?

  OK. Right now I'm focusing on getting the USB port to work when syncing
the Handspring. That would be a better solution in any case because its
native interface is USB.

Subject: [PLUG] Modem outdial service -- starting points for my research
Message-ID: <40F4183B.5020907@tercent.com>

Hi PLUG,

I'm looking at a project that may involve dialing out to get telemetry 
from units that don't have always-on Internet (archaic, I know).  While 
setting up 1..n modems for small n seems trivial, if n scales much 
beyond a reasonable chassis size it seems like it could get hairy.

Is there a name for equipment meant to do mass-outdial modem work?  I 
surmise that local ISPs must have modem banks to do inbound work.  Do 
they farm out modem banks for doing outbound work as well?

If anyone has a starting place for some googling (even just some of the 
jargon used in this field), I would appreciate it.  If you have 
experience setting this stuff up professionally, please contact me 
off-list to discuss a possible work opportunity.

Best,

Randall

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0407131012400.18529-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I have, what looks like, a SCSI host card going south.  I bought a new one
though a different brand and in a foolish moment thought I could just
switch them.  Not so, at least in my setup.  The boot process can't find 
the new SCSI host module.

I'm looking for ideas with the least amount of heartache and discontent to 
get the system booting with the new SCSI host card.

Currently I'm thinking I'll install the new card along side the old 
one, insmod the module for it, and do a mkinitrd for the new 
configuration.
   Does this raise any red flags for anyone?
   Any better suggestions?

 
TIA,
Rod

Message-ID: <1089740223.30259.17.camel@rhws.theplatinumrule.com>

I'm stuck trying to install the Wyvern (MUD) client on my FC1 system.

It requires that I be able to run the "java" program on my PC, which I
cannot find, nor an rpm. I cannot run #java -version, no such comand or
filename.

What do I need to do?

Here's the installation guide from http://www.cabochon.com 


You can use the Cross-Platform installer on any system that has Java
1.4.1 or higher. 

      * Make sure you have J2SE 1.4.1 or newer installed on your system.
        You should be able to type "java -version" to see if it's the
        right version.
        
      * Download the Pure Java/Cross Platform Installer and place it in
        a temp folder. 
        
      * Go into the temp folder and type "java -jar install.jar". This
        will launch the installer program. 
        
      * To run the Wyvern Client, create a launcher for your system that
        contains the following command. (Assumes you've installed it in
        the directory: /wyvern/client
               java -Dwyvern.home="/wyvern/client/wyvern" \
               -cp "wyvernclient.jar;jl020.jar;jogg-0.0.5.jar;jorbis-0.0.12.jar;mp3sp.1.5.jar;vorbisspi0.7.jar" \
               wyvern.client.Client
      * Run your newly-created launcher to run the client.

I think a cisco 2600 with a modem bank is what you are looking for.  I
believe you can configure them to do dialout depending on traffic.

The nice thing about this is the routing takes care of growth.  If you
need more modems you can buy more hardware and add more routing.  The
connection will take care of itself.

When I was doing it you could buy modem banks from Cisco in groups of 6,
so I believe that you could get a total of 48 into a Cisco 2600 which
would be 2 t1's worth of dialout.

It's been a while, but I believe this is where I would start looking.

Randall,

  Because you write that the data loggers do not have always-on 'Net
connections we can assume that this is not real-time data acquisition. In
this case, why not have a single modem at your data collection site the
polls the remote sites in sequence and at fixed intervals?

  The systems I have set up in the Real World involve waterproof data
loggers submerged in rivers. A tech goes out every month or two, hauls on
the hidden tether to retrieve each logger, downloads the data to a portable
computer, resets the logger and tosses it back into the water before hiding
the tether again. (Vandalism is a chronic problem out in the boonies.)

  On another project -- long ago and far away, in another galaxy named
Florida -- we had instrumented platforms set up in Lake Apopka. Data from
the instruments was sent in real time to the Water Management District's
headquarters by radio where it was caught and processed by PCs running QNX.

  There are definite solutions to your problem. Can you define it more
closely?

Roderick,

I would hook the drives up to the new SCSI controller and boot to a CD,
either the SCSI CD or an IDE CD.

Here's a good live CD. Of course, any CD will should do:

That's what I'd do.  In the future, you can run mkinitrd with the flag
to have it add in the module for the new controller and boot with the
new initrd after replacing the card.

As per the instructions below, you need to be sure you have Java

I have had problems in the past with different brands of SCSI controllers
presenting different Cylinder/Head/Sector geometry to the host which could
make your partition table invalid.

Get a copy of your MBR from the original card (if possible) so you can do
the appropriate translations if needed.

I just found out from my boss that I'm responsible for backing up one of 
our Linux servers that we've had for almost a year.  I know there are 
quite a few different options to do tape backups but I was wondering 
what some of you might suggest?  We have an HP DLT IV drive for this 
system.  Here is what I must have:

- Ability to do multiple incremental backups onto a single tape.
- Full backups
- Restore capabilities
- Since I'm the most experienced Linux person in my department I would 
like something straight forward that my   co-workers can use in case I'm 
on vacation or get hit by a bus or something.
- I prefer free, but I can spend money for backup software if I need to.

Thank You

Even before the Internet there were automated, mechanical devices which did 
the opposite - the field units dialed in and uploaded a spurt of data, then 
hung up. These could be timed to dial in according to schedule, or also 
programmed to dial in if an event occurred which required unusual attention - 
such as an overfill or fuel-low alarm at a remote storage tank.

Even earlier, home alarm systems had tape-loop devices which could send one or 
more pre-recorded messages to various telepone numbers.

The only problem is to TURN off these devices when the need ends - otherwise, 
as time passes and numbers get re-assigned you will have a storage tank in a 
long out-of-business gas station in Maine start dialing some poor sap in 
Bedford MA, every eight minutes with a 'help-me' beep whose meaning has long 
since been forgotten.

I recently built a dial out router for a friend.  MCI tried to charge 
$380 for less than
an hour of phone calls mostly under a minute a piece to a place about an 
hour's drive
away.  Phone service, at least CenturyTel's, can be hazardous to your 
pocket book.  
Consider buying phoneline simulation equipment.  I think skutch 
smiulators start at
$80 for a reasonable one with dialtone.  My guess is that you will want 
a teltone
system, though you should look beyond what E-Bay has to offer.  I wonder
if the data is real time.  After all, you can be real time when your 
probes dial a
connection if there's enough bandwidth.  Depending on how your data is 
encoded
and what you have to send, dial up may be adequate.

See if your server center can use a DSL variant that gives you twenty 
phones instead
of a high speed digital Internet connection.  You might want to research 
telephone
over WiFi and 56k radio technology as well.

Telephone service is not reasonably priced in most places.  In some 
remote locations,
it costs as much as the DSL does.  Be aware if the price is high that 
your looking at
a huge investment for scores of phonelines.  Long distance is a big 
problem, that's
why the Internet and cells phone are so hot.  Cable service is hot 
because telephone
service, usually required for DSL, is burdened by so many taxes, etc.

If your data isn't real time, recording it on site and picking up the 
recorders later may
prove to be cheaper.

Cheap and easy.

Get a paper clip.  Short from Tx to Rv pins.  It is easier on a female
plug, so grab a cable.  Google the proper pins.  Make sure you are
grounded (on a PC, this is easy, the case is ground by the power cord. 
On a laptop that may not be).

Search dmesg, /var/log/messages for something like:

        grep -i -i tty /var/log/messages
        Jul 13 14:06:35 localhost cardmgr[13728]: executing: './serial start ttyS1'
        Jul 13 14:06:35 localhost kernel: ttyS01 at port 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A

So open minicom as root. Pick /dev/ttyS1 (or ttyS0).  Note the ttyS01
means /dev/ttyS1.  Set to 300 baud, no handshaking (no software or
hardware).  Initialize Modem.

Type keys in minicom.  You should see them back.

If not check error logs.

Has anyone out here done this?

My overall goal is to provide a Corporate intranet that I am developing

- Authenticate Intranet against AD vs. using .htaccess files/MySQL/other
- Perform directory searches for corporate directory (have been
successful at implementing this)
- Allow remote users to change passwords (once all stars are aligned and
directory connections/authentication works)

I'm about to do the first two; the first with mod_ldap (I think) and the
second with Python-LDAP, instead of PHP.  I did a preliminary test to
connect to the AD server and it bound and searched just fine.

Oh, good. That tells me that it's serving an important enough function
so as to be backed up. Excellent!

[snip]

I have used a two-teir approach for my clients. 

First, I set up a "headless" backup server for processing the backups.
Every evening, each of the servers "rsync's" their data stores to the
backup server. Here's the good part: The backup area of the backup
servers is a samba share. 

In this scenario, users can click through the network neighbor hood to
the backup server, then click the folder of the server they want (file
server, mail server, whatever), and retrieve their information
themselves. Each server has 8 folders underneath, one for each day of
the week ("I remember having that file on Wednesday...") and a folder
marked "current," which is a compilation "full" of all of the week's
folders.

The permissions on the backup server is the same as the primary servers.
This prevents someone from the clerical staff "restoring" a file from
the President's home directory.

The second level of backups is the tape drive. The tapes are often sent
to a safety deposit box in the event of a natural disaster. 

For the tape backup part I highly recommend Amanda. Amanda can be
somewhat tricky to set up but once it's set up it works great. Here are
some of the things I like best about Amanda:

  1) It is capable (and practical) of backing up users' data stored on
the PC's local hard drive through the network neighborhood

  2) It sends an email every morning to admin-configurable email
addresses that contain statistics of the previous day's backup. It's
very thourough

  3) Amanda's config files are in plain text and plain English. It also
keeps an accurate record of those files that are backed up on a daily
basis for accurate backup auditing

  4) Amanda checks itself (I do it at 2:00 in the afternoon) so that
should there be any problem (wrong tape, remote server down, etc.)
Amanda sends an email to the backup team alerting them of the trouble,
"while they can still do something about it."

  5) Restorations from Amanda tapes may be performed even if Amanda
itself is not available wich leads to...

  6) Amanda performs it's backups by coordinating the standard Unix
"dump" utility.

In short, a two-tier backup system is really a nice way to perform your
backups. I would be happy to share my scripts should you need them.


Best,

  I'm sure you'll get a lot of replies using tar, rsync and other readily
available tools. I'd like to put in a plug (no pun intended) for the
software I've been using for 7 years: BRU. Yes, it's commercial but it also
just works and the support for configuration (or when there are errors or
missing information in the manual) is outstanding.

  Here everthing's run from a cron job. I have a Tandberg SLR-60 drive that
has worked flawlessly for the past 3+ years (which is more than I can say
for any of the other brands or types of drives). Anyway, one cron job runs
at 1:00 am M-Tu-W-Th and does an incremental backup of both
workstation/servers. On Friday nights (at 10:30 pm because it used to take 6
hours to do a full backup) a full backup is run. Each run automatically
verifies what has been written to tape. The only job is to remember to
switch tapes on Friday and put the weekly tape in on Monday. Of course, if
folks work on weekends you'll want to do your incrementals then, too.

  There are other vendors who advertise their pretty GUI applications. IMO,
backups should run as cron jobs so no GUI is required. And, restores should
be infrequent enough that typing on the command line should not cause
physical injury.

  I've restored everything to a new hard drive and it's worked like a charm.
I've restored single filesystems, directories and files with no problems at
all. Once I inadvertently deleted all the dot-files in my home directory. A
couple of minutes later they were all restored.

  The company also provides a bare-metal restore facility called CRU (Crash
Recovery Utility). I've never needed it so I cannot write anything about it.

  In my case, my entire business is dependent upon these machines and what
they contain. I don't mind spending money for the peace of mind I get from
this flawlessly running application. It will backup Microsoft and Apple
systems, too, as well as linux and whatever other flavors of *nix you have.

A Windows XP Home machine at our office has Worm.SomeFool.Gen-1.  What
are my options for getting rid of it?  Alas, installing linux isn't
an option.  Orcad and Pads are the primary reason that linux can't be
used.

Well you prolly have a leg up on me with the mod_ldap and python stuff
as I only know PHP...

Anyway, doing a search is easy since it binds to the OU...however to
authenticate, my scripts try to bind with CN=username which in AD, does
not match as the CN for my user records looks like "CN=LASTNAME\,
FIRSTNAME"  any ideas?

I'm about to do the first two; the first with mod_ldap (I think) and the
second with Python-LDAP, instead of PHP.  I did a preliminary test to
connect to the AD server and it bound and searched just fine.

Boot up with the INSERT CD, mount the (assuming NTFS) partition with
CAPTIVE, update the CLAMAV definitions, then have it scan the system for
nasties.

SCSI is wonderful except when it isn't, which unfortunately is often.

Others have remarked on the different drivers problems and the different
CHS geometry problems, going from card to card.  Rather than a software
solution, I suggest that you find another copy of the previously working
card. 

SCSI-2 is pretty stable technology, with nothing spectacularly new since
active terminators and DMA.  So staying with an old card design isn't
particularly restrictive.  I have standardized on Adaptec 2940, have 3
deployed, and keep 3 spares.  I plan to keep using these until they
stop appearing on Ebay (95 are for sale right now), and all but one
of the cards croaks.   Then I make a transition to the most popular
card-du-jour (with Linux support) at that future time.

There are a lot of used cards on Ebay, and chances are that there is
someone on this list that has a copy of that same card.  I have an
unused pair of Buslogic BT-930 aka BA81C15 cards, and an Advansys
ABP-960, for example.  Also, Freegeek may have your card. 

For some devices, there are easy upgrade paths.  For specialized and
critical items like SCSI controllers, plan on keeping some tested
spares.  Rebuilding boot kernels and SCSI drive images is no fun.

  The standard for extending a serial port over an IP network to a dial
server is RFC2217.  We use a Cisco with a ISDN T1 as the interface to the
telco network.  

RFC2217 - Telnet Com Port Control Option
http://sunsite.iisc.ernet.in/collection/rfc/rfc2217.html

The Windows client side software is DialOut/EZ.  They also have server
software.  

DialOut/EZ(tm) Redirector
http://www.tactical-sw.com/de.html

Cisco's comments on setting up an RFC2217 server:

Using Dialout/EZ with a Cisco Access Server
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/univgate/ps501/products_configuration
_example09186a00800a1992.shtml

There is an open-source RFC2217 server available:

sredird
http://www.gnu.org/directory/All_Packages_in_Directory/sredird.html


  I used sredird to set up a simple dual port server back when I was testing
all this stuff.  The software is a bit primitive, but it works OK.  A Linux
boxen with a multiport serial card, modems, and hard lines would work well
if you only need a small number of ports.

  The cost of the server and software would be a minor issue.  The recurring
telecomm costs may be the real problem.  A Cisco with a T1 WATS line may be
*much* cheaper than Linux box and POTS lines.  It depends on the number of
calls you intend to place, the LATA you're calling, and the number of ports
you need.

I'd recommend doing a little cost accounting first.

This card has been around since 1996 or 1997 -- a BusLogic Model BT-950 -- 
and in several different systems.  For the most part it has been great.  
Then I noticed a few years ago that Buslogic's quality was going down 
hill.  I've been moving to Adaptec slowly but surely.

I'll look into this.  I'm not normally an ebay'r and don't live in the
area so Freegeek isn't an option.  I may have to become an ebay'r.  I like 
this idea.  I have an LSI Logic LSIU80LVD sitting next to me (not sure 
which chip set it uses) that I'd really like to use.

Anyone on the list have a Buslogic BT-950 (or compatible) they'd let go
for a reasonable price?

Steve, Rich, Michael, Sean, et al.,

Thanks for your suggestions.  This has at least given me some starting

Do you folks or any others know of service providers to whom one can 
outsource this stuff, or do people who need it generally just get the

I will report back with my findings on this later on.

  Serial I/O is getting to be old technology.  Nobody does serial any more.
Cisco sold (or gave) their client software to Tactical Software.  The only
reason we still support it is because some of our users *must* send faxes
from their PC's.  

  Outsourcing to a service provider probably wouldn't be a good idea.
RFC2217 is an extension of telnet. It's inherently insecure.  You *could*
find a service provider to do special install of Cisco out-dial router over
a VPN tunnel, but it would probably be crazy expensive.  

  Any competent outsourcing shop, like Wil's Naked Ape Consulting, could get
you set up.  You may want to run "sredird" in a test environment to verify
your client side software will work correctly over RFC2217.  The server side
serial I/O stuff is pretty easy to get working.  It's the least of your
worries at this point.  Scaling up the client side to support dozens or
hundreds of lines could get complex.

Is the idea here to simply route instead of giving a direct dial-out 
connection
to each host in a remote network?  I'm not getting why a host
computer needs to control a modem on a server it goes out through.
My intuition is that the dial-out server should be transparent and
taking care of itself.

When logged on to Linux about half the Linux drive is occupied with (an

rid of it, and free the space up, or how how should I reinstall Linux so
that I do not have an NTFS partition on this drive?

Check out http://www.sysrescd.org.

There is the possibility of writing to NTFS, but doing that
safely in Linux could be difficult.  Something called explore2fs
written in Delphi for Windows didn't work very well when I
tried it, but that was a long time ago.  Microsoft doesn't want to
share a computer with anyone else's OS, so it may make sense
to avoid this entirely.  It's a question of how much trouble you
want to go to to make Windows play nice with another OS.
The trouble could cost you in time or money what you can get
a second computer for.

  The idea is that the users comm program still thinks it's talking to
ttyS0, COM1, IRQ4, whatever...  A little piece of client side software magic
redirects the comm port to an IP address somewhere in the network.  The
server may have real modems on serial ports or a digital card pretending to
be a bank of modems.  

  The users comm program continues setting comm port speed, parity, stop
bits, and flow control.  It still dials ATDT and expects to see a "Connect"
message.  The only difference is that instead of talking to local hardware,
the commands are redirected over an extension of the telnet protocol to a
remote server.  

  There are many reasons to redirect the comm ports.  Like doing least cost
routing, better quality circuits, better accounting, lower connect charges,
bypassing a digital PBX, or security issues.

I don't understand why you need multiple modems, but commonly I've seen
folks use terminal servers with regular external modems.  There are also
terminal servers with built-in modems.

If money's short, keep an eye out for lower-speed modem units or
terminal servers, since you won't be able to do better than 36 kbaud
dialing from modem to modem anyway.

The value in using terminal servers is that the interface to the host is
TCP/IP and ethernet, so you don't have to have any special hardware in
the server to talk to it.  You can even have multiple servers talking to
it.  And since you're basically using a Telnet connection to the modem
port, it's real easy to write the software that talks to it.

Thanks for the advice. I got used to a 2-drive system with windows 98,
and really liked it. If I could read and write to the Linux drive while
logged on to the Windows drive, that would be a workable compromise for
me.

You've already gotten numerous good answers but I'll pipe up and add 
that you can't just remove an existing SCSI contoller and place it with 
a different model or brand of card. The SCSI processor on the card tends 
to use it's own method of encoding data on the disk. This means that you 
can't  just swap out a SCSI controller with a different model and/or 
brand and have it read your existing data and the disk drive(s). The 
only way you can swap out a controller and have the new one work so you 
can boot your system and read your existing data  is to get the same 
brand and model so that the new card has the same processor as your 
existing card.

I've had a few SCSI controllers go bad on me over the years but I never 
had any issues since I replaced the defective card with the same brand 
and model.

Not true (except maybe in a hardware raid situation).

You can use any controller that is the same bus type for the disks
and still see the data on the disks.

Having the same brand may make it easier on the software side, but
there is no disk layout specified by a non-RAID SCSI card.

Galen, there is a freeware virus scanner -
Google "Avg freeware". You have to give put your email in order to get an
activation code, but I haven't gotten spam from them and I signed up years
ago.
You probably have a ton of spyware, so I suggest downloading "spy sweeper"
I think it is the best, although shit like "cool web search" and nkvd
hijacker often reinstalls itself somehow. Disabling IE and then installing
firefox pretty much solves the IE hijacks - the crap software is still
installed but doesn't work, so. . .
"cws shredder" and "hijack this" are other good apps, be a bit careful, and
run those after spy sweeper does its work. There is a freeware version of
spy sweeper under their downloads btw. 

You can try using system restore to get back to a pre virus point, but it
will probably fail and you will be better off disabling it as it will gladly
re-infect the system for you. 

You might want to take a knoppix disk so that you can delete windows files
without windows being retarded and preventing you from doing so. Of course,
if they are running ntfs (can home run it?), you will have a joyous time
mounting the damn disk +rw without pooching the directory structure. As you
can tell, this has never happened to me.

Agreed.  This only comes into play at boot time when a scsi controller
has to map CHS into a linear block number.  It's possible that the use
of LBA by todays BIOS' has eliminated this issue. 

Once the kernel is running, a SCSI disk will appear the same to any
non-RAID SCSI controller.

For anything except ext2/3, this is impossible (IIRC). For ext2/3 it is
expensive.

There is a read-write NTFS Linux driver called Captive:

One option is to simply unmount it and reformat it. As long as you don't
have any data on it, this should go well. If you want a partition to
access from Windows and Linux, then make it a FAT32 partition.

The other option is to delete the partition, enlarge the Linux
partition, and then enlarge the filesystem.

I would go into detail here, but I'm pressed for time. Good luck!

Easier just to reinstall the damn OS, use knoppix to copy data to your

My contemplated project is not Linux-specific, except
that I intend to install Linux on the computer being
modified. I would appreciate any advice that is
offered.

My Pavilion 7950 appears to have a defective
motherboard. Getting another one exactly like it
appears to be unlikely, and perhaps not even
desirable. It uses SDRAM and a 1.2-GHz Athlon
processor.

KSI's KM2M motherboard sells for around $60. It
accepts either SDRAM or DDR, so my investment in the
former would not be wasted. If my current processor
can be assumed to be socket-A, I could even use the
same processor, unless I wanted to upgrade it. The
manual that came with the computer is vague, and does
not say for sure whether the processor is socket-A,
although most AMD processors seem to be.

Usually by the time the motherboard of a computer is
defective, it's time to put the computer out on the
curb early in the morning. But perhaps I can get a
little more use out of the Pavilion.

Okay, but I'm really really sleepy and am about to go to bed, so bear

/sbin/cardctl ident
/sbin/cardctl info

The part about ext2/3 is a little confusing to me. After looking at references 
to this software on the web I concluded it is a partition resizer which must 
also have the capability of changing the format of the partition. But if I 
reinstall Linux with a FAT32 partition shouldn't Windows XP be able to read 
and write that partition without any further need for ext2/3?

Tim,

  I sent information to a friend yesterday that Monarch Computer Systems is
selling their 2003 Desktop System of the Year with an MSI (not KSI) KM2M
system board, Athlon 2400+ CPU and 256M DDR RAM (plus other essentials) for
$369. Therefore, the system board is almost certainly a good deal.

Message-ID: <1089819439.13140.4.camel@localhost.localdomain>

So here is the scenario:

At office I have a couple of USB devices:  KVM, Mouse, Keyboard.

At home I have nothing.

When I get home and power, Kudzu notices the missing USB devices, every
time.  I tell it to ignore, I say keep, next cycle, it asks again.

It does not ask at work when I boot.

So, I could disable kudzu or some other hack, but is there a way to keep
kudzu, but make it respect the "keep configurations" forever?

This is RH fedora (FC1).

Last time I reconfigured my kernel, I seem to remember there being an
experimental option that would allow you to write to NTFS partitions
from Linux.  It had all sorts of warnings about how dangerous it was
and all; but, you might give that a try.

I'd play with it on an expendable NTFS partition first just to see
how dangerous it actually is.

Here's the documentation for the flag:

I'm using kernel version 2.4.24; so, perhaps a 2.6 kernel will have
better NTFS support?

Hello Zot,
I had a situation where I had a Canon BJ4300 printer connected via
parallel cable detected by Kudzu in Fedora Core 2. When I moved the
system w/o the printer, Kudzu asked about it. I said to keep the
configuration, and it did not ask again. Therefore I assume it is one of
two issues. a) Fedora Core 2 does not have this issue, or more likely b)
because of the relatively new hotplug - udev stuff that may be in FC1
(not certain) it could be causing issues with kudzu. I don't know enough
about how it all works to be much help, but as you research why and a
resolution, these might be good jumping off points. Have you chimed in
to #fedora on the freenode irc server? There may be someone there that
can help.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0407140944580.20713@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I'm having fits trying to get a Handspring Visor Pro to sync with jpilot
on the IBM ThinkPad 600E. Perhaps someone here has some insight or
suggestions.

  First I tried the serial cradle we have for it. Set
/dev/jpilot->/dev/ttyS0, defined ~/.bash_profile/PILOTPORT=/dev/ttyS0 (and
exported it), specified /dev/ttyS0 in jpilot's settings. Permissions on
/dev/ttyS0 are 666. Will not sync; cannot connect.

  Second try was with the default USB cradle. Changed everything (shown
above) to ttyUSB0. When I test with 'pilot-xfer --list' I immediately see,
"port not connected".

  Third, the jpilot wiki notes that the Visor uses USB1. So, I convert the
above to USB1. Same results: port not connected.

  Now, I may have bought a defective machine with a non-working serial port.
But, a non-working USB port, too? Has anyone any ideas what's going on here
or what I can do to get this working? Is this a project for this Saturday's
clinic?

TIA,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] Big files, little RAM, little disk space... oh, and some Perl
Message-ID: <1089825039.29164.60.camel@dell.linux.box>

I'm working on importing some XML files into a database using perl.  The
files are available only via HTTP and are currently about 6MB compressed
(gzip), 40MB uncompressed.  While I do currently have the disk space for
this, these file are going to likely quadruple in size in the next few
months and I might not be able to handle all that.  Besides, I hate
putting things on disk in the first place.

So what I'm trying to do is this:  Read the gzip'd XML files from the
HTTP server as though they were local uncompressed files *without*
reading them entirely into RAM.  Using PerlIO::gzip, I can read the
compressed files as though they were not compressed, but I can't
currently read the HTTP files as if they were local.

Has anybody conquered this issue before?  I'd rather not write my own IO
driver for HTTP... no sense reinventing the wheel, you know?  :-)

Ideally this script I'm writing will read through the compressed XML
files as though they were local uncompressed files... I'm iterating
through them to save RAM at the moment.

Any pointers?  Am I nuts? ...errr... don't answer that one.

First, try this:

# ifconfig eth0

If that returns something that isn't an error, then you've already got 
the driver loaded. Otherwise, try this:

# modprobe pcnet_cs

What software are you talking about?

Installing Linux on FAT32 is a bad idea. I've never tried it, but it 
doesn't sound like something that would work very well.

Perhaps I don't understand your situation correctly. Could you explain 
it again, using device names?

  Problem solved. It helps to find a HOWTO that describes what modules need
to be loaded for communications to occur. I was lacking both usbserial.c and
visor.c. I had usb_core and usb_uhci (and, I think, one other) but they
weren't enough.

  Whew! Now to get sound working for her on this machine ....

  What is the syntax I use in /etc/modules.conf to add usbserial.c and
visor.c? As they are not now loaded I want to ensure that they are from now
on.

Thanks,

I don't think there's a way to do it in /etc/modules.conf (now 
/etc/modprobe.conf on FC2).

Most redhat-ish distros will check for file /etc/rc.modules and 
execute it at boot time. But don't just list module names in 
/etc/rc.modules. It's run as a shell script, so put the full
commands as in:

   modprobe visor
   modprobe usbserial

On my Debian system, you just put the name of the module (without the .o 
or .ko extension) in /etc/modules.

Terry,

  Many thanks. I just stuck them at the end of /etc/rc.d/rc.local rather
than putting them in /etc/rc.d/rc.M (it's a Slackware system). It works. I
was curious why I needed to load them like that since other USB modules are
automatically loaded.

  FWIW, the order needs to be reversed, I believe, because visor uses
usbserial.

That automatically installed Windows/C drive is in fact the other disk 
with the installed WinXP. Linux simply recognized it and mounted it. If 
you free up that space, you'll no linger have a dual boot system. One 
possible solution is to repartition the windows disk with two 
partitions. The first you would format with NTFS, and install WinXP 
there. The second partition, format with FAT. Then, when you boot Linux, 
you will have a Windows/C partition mounted as NTFS, and a Windows/D 
partition mounted as vfat. You set up you WinXP system so that files you 
want to access read/write are on the D drive (My Documents, etc.). This 
way, all of your WinXP system files (on the Windows/C partition) are 
protected from accidently being deleted or overwritten while in Linux. 
You mentioned that this was a new system, so there should be few 
personal files to save first.

I'd just go the braindead simple way:

        open INHANDLE, "lwp-request http://foo/bar | gzcat |") or die;

and start reading INHANDLE, or pass that to your XML parser.  The processes
up the pipe line will be blocked as needed, so you'll never have more
than a few dozen K of RAM burning.

I might just end up going that route... but I had originally wanted the
script to be portable enough that Windows users could use it if they get
perl on their systems somehow.  Hmmm.... I suppose if they were running
perl, they'd probably have gzcat, too.

Thanks...

FWIW, on my default ActivePerl install here, I have lwp-request but not 
gzcat.

I have something else wrong, then. I have the files in
/usr/java/jre1.4.2_04/bin/ and /usr/java/jre1.4.2_05/bin/, including the
executable file "java", but it still fails to invoke from a command
prompt, as root and as a user.

Is there a path command that allows it to run from there? 

Java works fine in Mozilla.

Is there something else I am missing?

It should work anyway. The modprobe utility will load any other modules
that are required by the one you requested. There are some odd cases where 
this won't work, in which case it can usually be fixed with a setting in 
/etc/modules.conf.

Given the speed that would be a socket A processor. Be careful when
moving the processor as the core is fully exposed. The big thing to watch
for is whether the power supply is an actual ATX one versus a proprietary
one.

Processors of that speed though are pretty cheap. Unless you're planning
for an AMD64 upgrade in the near future a faster processor and memory
might be worthwhile.

  Earlier this year Ed Sawicki and I tried to get a LaTeX/LyX SIG going but
no one other than Geoff showed up at the meetings. I realize that most of
the denizens here are system and network administrators whose writing tends
to consist of shell scripts, perl/php programs and memos to users.

  However, if there are folks here who write more than the occasional, brief
letter or invoice (which can be done with LyX/LaTeX but is much easier in
OO.o), then the LyX GUI front end to LaTeX is the way to go. I've written
all my articles and reports with LyX the past several years and I'm using it
to write my book. Trying to do that with a word processor I'll leave for the
masochists.

  If there is interest in learning how to use this fantastic typesetting
software please contact me off the list. I would like to get a SIG going or
offer tutorials and help duing clinics.

  The subscribers to the lyx-users mail list are outstanding in their
support but there are benefits to having local resources, too. If you are a
student and need to write term papers, a thesis or a dissertation, LyX is
the way to go. If you are writing manuals and other technical documentation
that is better when professionally typeset, LyX is the way to go.

  Lemme' know if you're interested.

Subject: [PLUG] guru needed - Debian production install scripts - small contract;
 sysadmin inquiry
Message-ID: <40F5E065.9010805@tercent.com>

Hi folks,

Guru needed for paid contract; simple scripts you've probably already 
written.

I need a set of installation materials and procedures to install woody, 
a specific kernel (for Dell), and certain packages, to go from bare 
metal to "ready for production."  Ideally, this would all be on one 
bootable CD, and would update itself from the net, but at a minimum, it 
would need to be a script runnable after the bare bones install.

I can give more requirements off-list.  Briefly, they include:
-NTP clients up and running for accurate time.
-Firewall up and running with appropriate holes punched through and best 
practice things in place (stopping the ping of death and all that jazz)
-Portsentry up and running for extra overkill.
-Tripwire
-Logrotate
-Apache
-Pine
-Java
-Apt-get for regular security updates
-anything I am forgetting that you justify as best practice
-checklist of any human things that then need to be done (ideally none)

My ideal for this would be to purchase the services of an experienced 
Debian guru, and then post the completed script(s) open-sourced to the 
web for others who share my needs (read: those who know Debian, know it 
works, don't have a mongo-script go get to production-ready and don't 
have time to piece one together by trial and error).

Ideally, you are such a Debian guru as to have *already written this 
system* or know of a tool that can do this, and used it for installs 
many times over -- for me, you'll just tweak it, explain it, and ship 
it.  Compensation to be cash and possible future contract work.  Please 
contact off-list.

I need to clarify my starting point. I had Windows XP on one physical drive, 
and Linux on a second physical drive. The automatic Suse installation 
partitioned my Linux drive into hda1 (an NTFS partition), hda2 (1 Gbyte swap, 
reiser format, and hda3(the rest, reiser). It also recognized a windows/D 
drive already formatted NTFS. While logged onto linux I could read both NTFS 
partitions but not write to either. While logged onto windows xp, I could 
read or write to the windows drive and to the NTFS partition on the Linux 
drive.

Next try. Reinstall Linux with the Linux NTFS partition converted to FAT32. 
Now I can read and write to that partition from linux, and I can read and 
write to that partition from windows. What I cannot do is write to the 
Windows drive while logged into Linux.

Next download, install compact software as suggested

http://www.jankratochvil.net/project/captive/

seemed to install ok, and renames the icon which brings up the windows drive, 
but I still can't write to that drive. The permissions still have that drive 
tagged as read only and wont let me change them.

Next try?? Perhaps I could add a FAT32 partition to the Window Drive. Then I 
would be able to read and write to part of the Windows drive, just as Windows 
can read and write to the FAT32 partition. If this were to work, it would 
meet my present needs, since I dont intend to meddle with Windows system 
files while logged onto Linux, and dont plan to install rpms from Windows.

What do you think? What should I try next? The group's advice has been very 
helpful to me so far in mapping out a strategy which has me part way to my 
goal. Thank you.

While booted into linux, go to an xterm window (Konsole), and type:
mount
Then copy the output and paste it into a reply. It should look similar 
to mine:
mel at d8qbcf21:~> mount
/dev/hda7 on / type reiserfs (rw)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,mode=0620,gid=5)
/dev/hda5 on /boot type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hda2 on /windows/C type ntfs 
(ro,noexec,nosuid,nodev,gid=100,umask=0002,nls=iso8859-1)
/dev/hda3 on /windows/D type vfat 
(rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,gid=100,umask=0002,iocharset=iso8859-1,code=437)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
usbdevfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbdevfs (rw)
mel at d8qbcf21:~>

The difference being that you should have some lines mounted on 
/dev/hdbX (X=some number). The hda lines are partitions on one disk, and 
the hdb lines are the other hard drive's partitions.  In my case, I dual 
boot on a single disk. While booted into WinXP, the system doesn't even 
know the Linux partition exists. But, while in Linux, (almost always) I 
can read and write to the D drive which is mounted vfat. The NTFS 
partition mounted as C, and is read only. It will be the same C and D 
drives in WinXP.

You will have to reformat that partition. Be sure that no files are 
there that you need. If Suse created the partition, it should be empty 
because Suse won't install the other OS. Ensure that /, /boot are on the 
same hd letter (hdaX or hdbX), as the one you intend to reformat.

That's a "feature" of NTFS.

That was the general idea I was going with. Create a FAT partition, 
because it can be accessed read/write from both operating systems.

Are you in the Portland area? You might consider bringing it all in to a 
Saturday clinic.

Either put /usr/java/jre1.4.2_05/bin in your PATH environment variable, 
or create a symlink in /usr/bin.

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/java/jre1.4.2_05/bin

ln -sf /usr/java/j2re1.4.2_05/bin/java /usr/bin

You could either run it using the full path, i.e.:

$ /usr/java/jre1.4.2_05/bin/java -version

or add that folder to your path (assuming bash is your shell):

$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/java/jre1.4.2_05/bin

Then you should be able to just do:

$ java -version

To do that permenantly, tack on the path to the appropriate part of your 
.bashrc

FYA, here's the clamwin results of scanning the infected machine.

-- summary --
Known viruses: 22689
Scanned directories: 1375
Scanned files: 54579
Infected files: 4872
Data scanned: 3095.12 MB
I/O buffer size: 131072 bytes
Time: 2178.356 sec (36 m 18 s)


The known viruses number is the number of viruses known to clamwin, not
the number of viruses found.  Nonetheless, 4872 infected files is a
couple of orders of magnitude greater than I was expecting.  A 
reinstall may very well be in order.

Thanks for everyone's help.

What you really need is a linux server, running on that old PII that XP
choked and regurgitated on.  Meets all of your requirements and more.:)

I always like to have a linux box around when I'm running Winbloze, it
just makes life easier somehow.

OOPS..I am running two dual boot systems in transition and got confused. Here 
is the one I am trying to refine.

Subject: [PLUG] Netgear FVS318 Problems
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0407150903540.26238@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Yesterday evening I tried to move my network to the new Netgear FVS318. I
failed in the attempt.

  With all local hosts and the WAP connected to the local ports on the 318 I
could ping and connect from one box to the other. But, I could not get to
the 'Net by ping, browser or anything else.

  After putting everything back to the Linksys switch and floppyfw box I
connected my notebook to the 318. Now I can ping its IP address (set on the
local subnet) but I can no longer reach the admin page with mozilla. The
username and password are rejected. After I try to cancel I see mozilla
display in each of the four window frames: "Warning: system authentification
fail, please contact your system administrator for correct information."

  Do I have options other than resetting the 318 and starting from scratch?

Thanks,

Rich

 I've used this same unit for quite some time both in office and 
personal uses for the last 1 1/2 years with several different units 
since we had people using them at home for VPN connectivity to the 
office. I do have connection issues with my company supplied WinXP 
laptop that I dual boot into SuSE Professional. On the XP side I have 
the McAfee Privacy Service and it appears to mess up both IE and Mozilla 
so that I'm unable to login to the FVS318. If I disable the privacy 
service I can get logged into the firewall but  after a while I lose the 
connection to the firewall and cannot get any response. I have to use 
Linux to actually mange the unit because of the problems with WinXP.

One thing you might consider doing if you find you need to ever reset 
the unit is to save the configuration offline in a file and then you can 
restore the configuration back so your configuration settings are not 
lost. The unit(s) we have in the company I work for have been 
bulletproof and the only time I've had to reset a unit was after a 
firmware upgrade. To be safe I would also make sure that you're running 
the latest non-Beta version of the firmware which I believe is 2.3? I 
bought a FVS318 about a month ago and it didn't have the latest firmware 
and so had to upgrade.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0407151139390.31617-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

Way, very, mucho Off Topic ... Windows shares ... but I'm out of ideas.

If anyone can, or is willing to help we can go off list with this.

Though it started as a Linux access to a SMB/CIF share issue.

In my never ending quest to make the Windows systems I have to deal with
do more automagically instead of requiring a pot-full of mousing around
and clicking I realized I was dealing with far too many Windows shares.  

So I was going to treat one server as a central share point (network
storage?) and have all the CGIs (Windows/IIS and Linux/Apache) use a
common area for writing to.  Guess what?  I can't get a CGI running under
IIS to write to a share on another Windows system.

I can create a share on the Linux box, but besides making the Technical
Manager upset, Windows doesn't deal with file it 'thinks' other processes
might be using.  Heck it won't even let me open a file for viewing
sometimes if it gets it in it's pointy little headed self that some other
program might be using it.

So after hours of search on Microsoft's site, using Google, and 
labmice.com I am stymied.

In the mean time I'm doing/dealing with it the way it is and will make my 
admin scripts/CGIs on the Linux boxes do what is needed and hopefully get 
a solution some day.  Heck I'm for dumping the Windows stuff and doing it 
all a new (GNU? ;-) way.

So any pointers or ideas (off list) are welcome.


TIA,
Rod

This smells like a permissions issue.
I would first look at the share perms.
They should be wide open allowing you to control access at the NTFS level.

Tony,

  Linux is all I have. When I try using 'links' I find that there's a socket
problem.

  I didn't see any option for saving the configuration when I set it up. I'm
also looking for directions on how to upgrade the firmware. I downloaded the
6.3.1 version but don't know what to do with it. The instructions I find on
the Netgear Web site are for initial installation of the unit.

Thanks,

Tony,

  I'm starting from scratch. It is not that difficult, but this time I'll
check the firmware version (yes, the latest is 2.3; I had downloaded the
wrong file before) and figure out how to save the configuration to a file.

  New question that may be related to my inability to access the 'Net with
it. I've assigned the 318 the IP address of my floppyfw box (they're not on
the network simultaneously so there's no conflict) because all hosts have
that IP address as the gateway. But, ... I just realized that when I set up
the gateway in the 318 it must be the external gateway address of my ISP.
Correct?

Thanks,

Rich

OH yeah.  Gave permissions that makes my heart flutter (keeping it clean
as the affected body part is a bit lower) to think of.

Share, NTFS, the whole lot were tried.  Way too many permutations so some
may have been missed but I doubt it.  Funny thing is, Scheduled Tasks can
read and write to the share but not an IIS CGI process.

You have to be specific when say "gateway".  On the inside LAN you would 
setup the default gateway for all of your systems so they use the FVS318 
as their gateway. On the  WAN side of the firewall you would use the 
default gateway your ISP supplies to you or you get it via DHCP if you 
have a dynamically assigned IP address. I tend to use DHCP on the LAN 
side with these FVS318 units and the DHCP server always gives the unit's 
LAN IP address as the default gateway.

Tony,

  Yup. That's the way I had it before, too: the router is the inside gateway
and my ISP's gateway is entered (along with the external IP address and
netmask) at the right place.

  This time, I paid attention to details and saved the config file as well
as upgrading the firmware from 2.2 to 2.3. However, I'm going to wait until
this evening to test it all out.

Thanks,

Rich

The "launcher" is bassically a script that sets up the classpath and calls java with the correct arguments. In this case you want to have the jars mentioned above on your classpath when you call java. Either use the CLASSPATH environment variable or use the -cp option to java as above. The expample above is using a ";" as a classpath seperator. This is a windows thing. If you are on unix, use a ":" for the classpath seperator. The class wyvern.client.Client is probably in one of the jar files. If I had to guess, I'd say look in the wyvernclient.jar. As long as this jar is on your classpath the class should be found by the java vm.

Message-ID: <071520042142.9653.40F6FA4300028724000025B522007358349B029A08020E03040709@comcast.net>

Hi.

Over the course of my last few years, I've become the main person "responsible" for two servers. Both of them are "hopelessly" out of date. One is running Slackware 3.5 (I think. Uname reports kernel version 2.2.16), and the other is running Redhat 7.2 (uname reports kernel 2.4.9-31).

I'm seriously considering attempting remote changes to their systems. One, the redhat computer, is a RackSpace computer, so travel to it is pretty much "not gonna happen." The Slackware computer resides at an ex-client's (they hired someone at part time to replace my consulting rates). 

I found these instructions for using red carpet to remotely upgrade from RH 7.3 to RH 9.0, and apparently they'd work for getting it all the way to Fedora 2 (although I'd be starting from RH 7.2 not RH 7.3).

http://us.seekbrain.com/archives/000028.html

The Slackware computer, I wouldn't mind seeing become Debian. But I"m not sure of the course of action required to get it to there. On the other hand, perhaps I just ought to write them a letter about it and suggest they upgrade- because while I feel responsible for the system (the new guy doesn't appear to know it's there), I'm no longer employed/retained by that client. 

Suggestions for either of these situations would be helpful :)

I'm sorry to ask this, but I can't figure out what words to put into google to get what I want out. I recall that there is a command I can use from one computer to connect to another computer to have the second computer open up a ssh tunnel back to computer one (and then my command on computer one's done and there's still a ssh tunnel going.). 

I'm trying to configure mysql replication over ssh, and I think I have it mostly figured out, but I need this part to demonstrate what it's doing- I want my home box to replicate my workstation's box's mysql, but don't want to ask my boss to open another port through the firewall.

Any words of wisdom?

It's called 'port forwarding'.  Experiment with the -L and -R options.

I don't think I understand exactly what you want, but I do know the 
general area. This command will allow you to connect to port 10000 on 
client and have it behave like port 3306 on server:

user at client $ ssh -L10000:localhost:3306 user at server

This will do the reverse (port 10000 on server is equivalent to port 
3306 on client):

user at client $ ssh -R10000:localhost:3306 user at server

The manpage for ssh explains these options rather well. I think the 
phrase you want for Google is "ssh tcp port forwarding"

You're going to hate this...

The command is:
ssh <IP Addr or Hostname> <command>

Example:
ssh <remotehost> /usr/X11R6/bin/xcalc

Subject: [PLUG] Creating a patch...
Message-ID: <40F772A1.2060202@robinson-west.com>

I copied Redhat 7.3's stock postfix init script to a safe location and 
modified
it.  I now want to create a patch to go from the original version to my 
newer
one.  

Is there some way to script different stop behavior based on whether
or not the system is shutting down that's easy?   My point in using
a ramdrive is to avoid excessive writing to slow nonvolatile storage.  
I'm also trying to keep non classified email messages away from
hard to erase media.

I could do a special sstop that doesn't record the contents of the 
ramdrive,
but I prefer to make stop smarter.  I experimentally checked the runlevel
in the script.  I don't think the runlevel is 0 or 6 when init is killing
processes servicing a halt/reboot request.  Oddly, I can echo the
runlevel during ordinary stop requests, but the runlevel won't echo
during a shutdown.  I was trying a combination of the
runlevel command and cut to get it.  I assume the delimiter for
cut is '\W' and that the field of interest is always the second one.

I want a patch that's compatible with gnu's patch utility commonly used
with the kernel source.

Did you try mapping the share as a drive?

Just wondering.

Can you uninstall one hard drive and clean up the other drive's
partitions with a knoppix cd, or a cd from http://www.sysrescd.org?

Back up the data that matters.  I've never heard of a new computer being
built with two hard drives and Windows XP partitions across both.  The
big problem will likely be drive letters changing if you attempt to free up
one of those drives from Windows.  Linux is superior because it doesn't
have drive letters.  If a cdrom moves because a partition is gone, that
can be a real pain.  A program called xosl, http://www.xosl.org,
used to be able to help with the drive letter problem via partition
hiding.  The idea, essentially, was to allow multiple copies of Windows,
Windows and a mirror, or even Windows and dos to be installed on the
same drive without more than one hard drive partition showing upon
booting any of the installed Microsoft systems.
  
I don't know if the nonfree partition magic extends the power of xosl
to Windows XP, or not.  My copy of xosl, or ranish at least, does not
support NTFS.  NTFS used to need a fat partition for booting, but
I don't know that this is true in your case or if it has only been true
on Alpha systems.

When you boot Windows XP, are the two NTFS partitions visible?

Do you have Windows XP installation disks?

Can you safely remove both hard drives, or is there only one drive?

Do you need to share files between Windows and Linux, for sure?

Is this a laptop, or a full size?

I needed qtparted, but a fairly recent(  like last term ) version.  I 
safely shrunk
a Windows XP partition using that.  I believe it can delete NTFS partitions
also.  I've removed NTFS on my old Alpha system, but I think that was the
through the firmware, low level.  Does Microsoft think NTFS is more secure
simply because it's specifics are a secret?  What does it have that FAT32
lacks?  I've heard that NTFS security breaks preventing people from
accessing their files.  

My recommendation with Windows is to seriously consider using drive trays
and installing only Linux on one drive and only Windows on another.  With
two drive trays, the first one set to boot, you can switch out operating 
systems
easily.  If you need to use files on a Windows partition in Linux, 
consider a
Linux supported USB drive tray to load the Windows drive in when you're
running Linux.  USB is plug and play, so you can hook the tray up after 
Linux
has booted.    

If you are just wanting to back up NTFS under Linux, consider dd.  Trouble
is, you have to know the number of blocks.  A 1.44 meg floppy disk is 14400
for block size.  I wonder if tar can be used directly on a device file.

There is vmware and wine, I think you can run the NTFS drive in a Windows
emulator.

Google for explore2fs.

Oh yeah ... again.  From the reading I and Tim have done this is probably
a 'feature' of MS Windows without active directories and/or domains.  I'm 
near the point of trying to make the drive/directory a virtual directory 
for the specific website/domain and seeing if that works.
   Geez do I hate dealing with Windows servers.  If these were Apache on 
Linux there would be no problems besides my fingers.

Well thanks to all for the ideas.  I'm going to drop this since MS gets 
too much press already.  I have a kludge that works so we can save some 
bandwidth.

  Does anyone know if the Fujitsu/Orckit ORFAST-R2-A-SA-BR-US dsl modem
requires a specific MAC on the firewall in order to properly work? If so,
would that number be hand written on a label on the unit?

  I'm trying to get the new firewall appliance to allow me to access the
'Net. All internal Netgear tests work, but I cannot ping or do a dns lookup.
It's a fine switch for the internal network but nothing goes in or out from
it.

  Google has nothing. There are 4 hits on the model number and none is
relevant.

Thanks,

Full size. It came with  Windows Xp in a single partition on one disk, and I 
installed Suse 9.0 Linux on the other. Suse made an NTFS partition on the 
Linux disk. I could read and write to that partition while logged onto XP, 
but not while logged onto Linux. I changed the Linux NTFS partition to FAT32 
by reinstalling Linux. Now I can read and write to that FAT32 partition on 
the Linux disk while logged into either system which satisfies my immediate 
needs.

I gather that I could reinstall XP with a FAT32 partition, and could then 
write to the XP disk while logged into either operating system, but I am not 
anxious to meddle with Windows XP. I would rather spend my time learning 
Linux things. In time linux distributions will offer read/write capabilities 
with NTFS.

Ok, in your case windows/C is on the same drive as linux:
/dev/hda3 on / type reiserfs (rw)
        ^
/dev/hda1 on /windows/C type vfat
        ^
and you can read and write to files in windows/C because it is a FAT 
partition.

Your WinXP boot drive shows up as window/D under linux:
/dev/hdb1 on /windows/D type ntfs
        ^
With this setup, it could be confusing when switching between the two 
operating systems. When you boot up WinXP, it will be drive C, and the 
FAT partition on the linux drive would probably be seen as drive D. Just 
the opposite of when booted as linux. You could edit /etc/mtab to switch 
the drive letters.

I believe if you want to switch drive letters you should do the editing
in /etc/fstab... 

I believe /etc/mtab gets rewritten on boot??

That's /etc/fstab. /etc/mtab is used by mount to determine what 
filesystems are mounted where.

  Please continue to ignore this request. The modem does _not_ need a
specific MAC to function. My lack of hardware luck continues: after 1.5
hours trying to get in touch with Netgear support and speaking with two of
their technicians, they confirmed that there's something broken internally
on the FVS318. If I jumper the 'Net port to an internal port the "Internet"
light is on. Otherwise, it stays off. We tried 3 different cat5 cables and
the techie tried telling me the modem port was bad. When I asked why the
modem worked perfectly with the current setup if it had a bad port he went
to check with someone else there. That's when he conceded I have -- once
again -- a DOA hardware purchase.

  The RMA process with the vendor is in process.

Sigh,

Rich

Don't think so. I have the same model and it's always just worked when I
plugged it in. The DSL modem is in bridging mode, so it doesn't do any
router functions, just translates the packets for you. Verizon does use
bootp around here, so if you do switch out devices without cloning the mac
addy, you will get a new IP. How is DHCP working for you btw?

Subject: [PLUG] Need information on Fujitsu/Orckit DSL modem

  Does anyone know if the Fujitsu/Orckit ORFAST-R2-A-SA-BR-US dsl modem
requires a specific MAC on the firewall in order to properly work? If so,
would that number be hand written on a label on the unit?

  I'm trying to get the new firewall appliance to allow me to access the
'Net. All internal Netgear tests work, but I cannot ping or do a dns lookup.
It's a fine switch for the internal network but nothing goes in or out from
it.

  Google has nothing. There are 4 hits on the model number and none is
relevant.

Thanks,

Rich

Cool!  My experience with major libc upgrades on Redhat has been
terrible, so it's noce to see there may be a way to do it.

Debian Chroot Install.  Three HOWTOs linked here:
http://www.linuxmafia.com/kb/Debian
There should be another one in the Debian Install manual.

I think that's a better idea.  If it ain't yours to fix, don't.

Karol,

  Verizon doesn't provide IP addresses, my ISP does. I spoke with one of
their techies this morning: no specific MAC address required and the line is
still clear and fast. He expressed surprise that I've been a customer of
theirs for 5+ years. But, I've had no problems the past 4+ years; as you
write, it just works.

  Don't do DHCP. All static IP addresses.

  After a terribly frustrating almost-3 hours of trying to reply to a
Netgear e-mail message (can't contact them that way), failed Web pages, a
support tech who left me on hold for 5 minutes, then one who kept insisting
my DSL modem had a bad port, they finally acknowledged that it's the new,
Netgear router that's internally broken. The only way I get the Internet
light to turn on is when it's patched to one of its own lan ports.

  So, now I've filled out an RMA request for ebuyer.com (no phone number on
their Web site) and I'll go through the whole Linksys smear again. What a
PITA!

  Thanks for reminding me of this, Aaron! I have forgotten about this
because on Slackware (apparently with Debian, too) it's a non-issue. The
upgrades go through smoothly. Wish my hardware purchases worked as well.

  Here's another reason I can mention when folks ask me why I switched
distributions.

Subject: [PLUG] CUPS on Red Hat 9 server
Message-ID: <40F82881.7080900@brianquade.net>

I finally got CUPS to print from my newly installed print server and I 
am having the same problem I have had every time I have installed CUPS.  
It prints text like I would expect it to print an image, so if it can't 
print the whole last line at the bottom of the page, it just cuts it in 
half horizontally and I get an unreadable line at the bottom of the 
first page that is only the top half of the line and another unreadable 
line at the top of the second page that is the bottom half of the line.  
I am really worried about this because I will need to print a lot of 
very important documents soon and my printer has to be set up very 
reliably.  I have never even gotten close to getting lpd working and I 
have no idea what is wrong with my CUPS setup, or if this is just a bug 
in the software.  Has anyone had this problem, or know how to solve it?

I am using:
CUPS 1.1.7-13.3.0.3 (the update for Red Hat 9)
foomatic 2.0.2-15
ghostscript 7.05-32
hpijs 1.3-32

I have an HP Deskjet 940 C printer.

One thing to bear in mind is that none of our regular volunteers - as far
as I know - are wifi experts. If it's just a basic install, then I'm sure
they'll get you going. If it requires a lot of specialized knowledge they
may not.

  ... and if the BEFW11S4 is flaky no amount of specialized knowledge will
help. Been there; done that. Twice. At least the WAP45G is running reliably.

And from another viewpoint, my BEFW11S4 has travelled cross country
with me and worked in 3 different hotel rooms, as well as a year of
stationary service before I moved.  Solid as a rock, it just works.

I've had problems with my BEFW11S4, but were always fixed with the latest
firmware.

For example, a couple months ago the DHCP server would decide to give someone an
address based on moon alignment.  The latest firmware at the time fixed that.
Then this week, I wanted to change my PTP assigned subnet from a /28 to a /24.  It
would not allow me to do this simple mask change.  The latest firmware at the time
(this Wednesday) fixed that too.  

Their quality control is poor, but at least a fix was always available.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0407161610030.1016@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I'm bringing my fiancee's ThinkPad 600E to the clinic tomorrow for help
getting the sound to work. I've been futzing with this off-and-on all week
and it has me beat.

  By googling I found several sites referencing the problem. I tried a few
of the solutions, but none worked here. The most promising -- and latest
attempt -- is to create an rc.sound file that loads the cs4232 driver and
the cmix volume control. Downloaded, built and installed the latter and all
looks good. lsmod shows the proper modules loaded and ready to go.
RealPlayer8 is also installed and ready to go, but it shows video silently.

  I discovered that on my Sony Vaio the sound works only when the unit is
plugged into the wall. Perhaps this is because the cpu speed is
automatically decreased when running on battery and realplayer considers it
too slow. I don't know. Anyway, I've tried getting sound on the IBM only
when it's running on AC and it's not working for me.

  Hope someone who knows sound issues will be there tomorrow.

Thanks,

Rich

I'll be there with my ThinkPad 600E. Sound works on mine, so we can rule
out hardware issues by swapping drives.

Don't know much specifically about IIS, but I'd wager that the CGI process
is being spawned with access rights less than admin.  A less probable
possibility is that things are set up such that admin can't get through for
security reasons. You might try creating an endless loop CGI so it persists
long enough for you to look at its stats.

I have a Debian box connected to a modem connecting to

I have a nic card coming from the dial-up computer to 
the Router...

Before I had the router.  I just connected the other computer
to a hub and the hub connected to the other computer <Debian> which
did NAT <Network address translation>.. That way I had both
computers on the net with one dial up..

What's the goal?

You can use the Debian box to route to the public network and NAT the
boxes behind it and just use the Linksys device as a switch, if that's
what you'd like.

Or you can let the Linksys device do the routing and switching and NAT
(HAT, really, I assume) and just use the Debian box as a bridge (really, a
point-to-point router with different media on each interface).

There are all kinds of configurations to make those two boxes do things
together.

This makes sense, and AFAIK, the Linksys will route private IP
addresses, which means it should work without any changes to the Debian
configuration, as long as the LAN is on a different subnet then the
subnet the Debian box and the WAN port of the Linksys are on.

Good Luck,

Evan,

  As you noticed by now I could not make it to the clinic. The power supply
on my server failed last night (great way to begin the weekend!). So, today
was waiting for Fry's to open, buying a replacement supply, discovering the new
supply has 2 fewer plugs, going to ENU to buy splitters and putting it all
back together.

  I've had enough hardware issues to last me all month.

Thanks,

Rich

  The floppy drive in my server was an antique dual-format model (5.25" &
3.5"). Each time I had to reboot the system the BIOS complained about a
floppy drive malfunction (which didn't seem to stop it from working, but
...). So, as long as I had to disassemble the box to replace the power
supply I replaced that unit with a 3.5" drive. New cable, too, 'cause the
old one has an edge connector, not a pin connector.

  So, red stripe to the outside (the only way the cable will fit the drive),
and the power connector on the only way it fits and I still get the same

  Any ideas what I did wrong? This is a new one on me.

Floppy cable connected backwards?  Perhaps on the mobo?

Floppy light on continuously = ribbon cable backwards.
Make the cable fit or flip it around on the motherboard end.

I'm here at the clinic, but I soon won't be.

My sound is working with the OSS modules (module cs4232). If you need ALSA,
I can't help you.

You might have 2 drives enabled in the BIOS, i.e. a: is 3.5", b: is 5.25".
Disable the 5.25" drive.

Wil,

  That seems to be the only available option. I'll check later this week
when I _deliberately_ take down the system and open it up.

  As Wil noted, too, I probably put it in backwards on the system board. I
thought that was the only possible place to mess up while I put the box back
together again.

 Most often this is a setting in your printcap or other printer format
file. I had the same problem with a Lexmark Z23 and I switched the
format from 8 1/2 x 11 to Executive format. I later fixed it but can't
recall exactly what I did in which file. 
 If you can live with Executive format then don't sweat it.

This happens fairly often.  I have rolls of little colored sticky dots,
about 6mm diameter.  Before a motherboard or drive disappears into a
cabinet, I stick a colored dot near the pin 1 end of the drive or
connector.  This makes future cable changes a lot easier and safer.

Note, sometimes pin1 is not marked explicitly on a motherboard or in
a manual.  However, on typical circuit boards and connectors with
"through hole" (not surface mounted) pins, the connector comes through
to the back side of the board.  The pads for most of the connector pins
are round, but pin 1 is usually square.  You will only be able to see
that with the motherboard out of the case, of course.

Keyed connectors are supposed to eliminate the possibility of inverting
a cable, but sometimes enthusiasm makes a connector fit when it shouldn't.

Many floppy drives are constructed in such a way that the cable will fit
either way.  It is a royal pain to get it right when you already have
the drive mounted in the machine.

Your cable is backwards on one end.

I have a phone system with a serial cable connected to a Linux box.  When
I've previously connected the serial cable to a Windows box, hyperterm
would see the phone system messages that it spits out as new calls come
in, etc.  So now I'm trying to do the same thing with minicom.  I've got
the serial port /dev/ttyS0 and the speed 19200 8N1 configured and minicom
shows it's connected, but I never see anything from the phone system
displayed to the screen.  Am I missing a configuration setting in minicom
somewhere?  Perhaps something in the "modem and dialing" parameters makes
minicom think it's talking to a modem?

The next step is to write a script that will connect periodically and
retrieve this same information, but I'd like to see that things are
working in minicom first.
Thanks,
~M

Perhaps you need to change the setting of flow-control?  "None",
XON/XOFF, RTS/CTS.

Hmmm...  It appears to be working.  "None" for flow-control was already
set. I removed the modem init string and reset string and I eventually
received several lines of call data.

I'm toying with the idea of starting my own computer/network consulting
business.  At this point I'm just collecting information and I'd like to
hear from others that are currently doing this type of work or have done
it in the past.

How was your experience?  What were the major hurdles to getting started?
What methods did you use to solicit new business?  Was it a constant daily
chore to find new business or were you able acquire a solid base of
customers that provided enough work to keep food on the table?  Did you
run into any problems with other companies with similar names, and if so,
how was this resolved?  What was a typical day like?  There is an enormous
amount of differing technologies deployed and it's close to impossible to

Outsource... if your customer relies on you for all their IT needs, then
if you can't implement something they want implemented and implement it
well, look for somebody else who can.  Being in the business, you're
able to be an effective middle-man.

Get yourself a network you can rely on.  If you need to do X, you go ask
John over there for help...

You could make it a little shorter too:


#!/bin/bash

wget -O - "http://www.mcmenamins.com/index.php?type=theater" | grep strong > ~/movies/mcmen.html

~/firefox/firefox ~/movies/mcmen.html


It'd be cool if you could pipe HTML directly to Firefox...

| How was your experience?

So far it's ok.

~ What were the major hurdles to getting started?

My major hurdle right now is finding clients who will work with my
schedule.  I already have a full time job and I desire the stability it
provides.  My schedule there is relatively flexible but I do need to
show up Monday through Friday.  The hours I work on those days can be
somewhat flexible.  What that means is that I can't come into a client's
place and do work 8-5 for them.  It seems many of them want exactly just
that.

| What methods did you use to solicit new business?

My main method is word of mouth because given my dilemma that I
explained above, advertising will only mean I get calls from many people
who are expecting me to work at their location from 8-5 for a few days
(or however long it takes) until the project work is done.  Word of
mouth does two things for me.  The potential clients already know of my
scheduling constraints so if they contact me they are most likely
willing to work with that.  In addition, the potential client also knows
that my work is done well because essentially it's a referral from
another person that has seen my work and have been happy with it.

~  Was it a constant daily
| chore to find new business or were you able acquire a solid base of
| customers that provided enough work to keep food on the table?

It's a constant daily chore.  That's why I decided to just take a stable
regular job and do the consulting work on the side.

~ Did you
| run into any problems with other companies with similar names, and if so,
| how was this resolved?

Yes.  My original business name was SETEC-Astronomy, taken from that
movie Sneakers.  This caused too much confusion for potential clients
and others because they thought I did something to do with astronomy.  I
just changed my business name to reflect that of my last name, which is
Fetter Consulting.

Oh, and I had one guy who actually had a different business name, but he
straight up stole my web content verbatim.  I contacted him and told
him.  He replied and said it was his cousin who did the work or
something like that and he removed it, which he actually did.

~  What was a typical day like?

Evaluate what they are really asking for.  Explain to them what it will
take in both time and products.  Then start the work giving them an
outline of the schedule I will work with them on as well as providing
them with all of my contact information should they have an emergency.
Generally, I can leave my regular work with no issue should such a thing
arise.

~  There is an enormous
| amount of differing technologies deployed and it's close to impossible to
| be an expert in all areas, so if a customer had a tech need that you were
| not proficient with, did you still take the work and learn on the job?

I keep a close list of others who I have worked with throughout my
career in the industry.  Should something of that nature come up then I
will recommend the client to them.  This way I can at least have an idea
of the persons work quality so if nothing else my recommendation will be
remembered by the client and I will still be top of the list for future
work.

| Any additional information would be greatly appreciated.

Good luck.  It seems to me that in these times, it's still relatively
risky business to put your entire income into consulting.  I would
recommend at least having a part-time regular job along with the
consulting, but that's just me.

Matt,

  Answer three questions for yourself:

  1.) What business am I in? In other words, exactly what products or
services do you offer?

  2.) Who is my market? To whom will you sell those services?

  3.) Why should they buy from me rather than from one of my competitors?
What makes you unique and not an off-the-shelf commodity?

Rich

I do the same for a KX-T123211D, the output is called SMDR.  I discovered 
a program called ttywatch a couple of years ago.  It provides redirecting 
output to syslog as well as permiting you to telnet to a port on the host 
and interact with the the phone system without interupting the recording.

a) you had better hope ~/movies exists.  The '>' stomps everything
   that needs stomping.

b) "*.*" is sort of a DOS-ism.  A plain '*' would do the trick, if
   that was desirable (which it isn't in this case).

b) if Randal sees that `cat foo | grep', he'll howl.  Try `grep < foo'
   instead.  

I like Matt's condensation a lot better.

Well, anybody should... 'tis UUOC!

And, actually, I would guess it's probably more efficient to let grep
open the file itself.

grep string foo

Of course, that's splitting hairs.

VMware may have its virtues, but being free is not one
of them. This is not true of Bochs. Is anyone who has
tried it satisfied with its performance?

Terminal emulation?  Sometimes it helps to play with it.

Good Luck,

Well, I did get it to load win'98, but the graphics suck, and I keep
getting an error message that makes no sense, however it will continue
on.  Be prepared to fiddle with the configuration file, the settings in
there are dependent on the speed of your system.

Middle click to release the mouse from the window.

Tim,

  A number of years ago I discovered that the additional question to ask is
will this other emulator run the software I need to use?

  In my case, the two winduhs-specific apps run only in VMware and not any
of the no-cost options. This may change some day, but it is a consideration.

Hi,

Some of the instructors at work are discussing why Windows is used to teach

"Or is there some slick, visual, possibly XWindows-based Unix environment

Any developers out there have some open source recommendations I can promote?

There are a number of them, Eclipse is the first to come to mind,
however.  I'm pretty sure Emacs can be set up to behave similarly.  But
the real question you should be asking is "is Windows used to teach
programming?"  For at least one University in the Portland area the
answer is a resounding "no".  Sure, you can use Windows to write your
programs, but they must compile with gcc and, at least some professors,
require they be submitted as shars.  Of course, I've also heard nasty
rumors that they switched from C++ to Java for the undergrad courses, so
I'm not sure where that leaves us...

PSU and PCC, AFAIK, both use C++ and gcc.  I haven't taken PCC CS
courses, but they were mentioned in my PSU CS courses.  PSU requires
projects be submitted as shars when you're dealing with multiple files,
as well.

PCC was said to have switched to Java a few years ago, but then switched
back, according to my PSU professor.

KDevelop is good but not as smooth yet as Visual
Studio.

I couldn't agree more. In my CS courses the code
usually had to compile on gcc or the java compiler
even if you wrote it in an IDE. In my CS101 class
someone was rebuffed for even asking how to compile a
program in VC++. The professor went so far as to say,
"my five year old knows how to use programs." He was a
jerk but had a point!

I'm think about switching phone service to Vonage - VOIP because doing
so cuts my monthly phone bill in half.

I'd appreciate learning about others experiences with Vonage and VOIP.

Bochs seems to be in active development, with new
releases pretty often. Perhaps this should be borne in
mind.

Mike,

  I have no idea what eye candy is provided by Visual Studio, but take a
look at Eclipse <http://www.eclipse.org/>. It developed from IBM's GUI
Websphere and is now its own organization. It is the emacs of the GUI world.

  My uses include java, UML and database schemas. I'm adding EMF (the
Eclipse Modeling Framework) and there should be C/C++ support any minute
now. As a matter of fact, it could be the subject of a semester's course all
by itself. :-)

My Vonage nightmare:

On a good day the echos are just a little bit annoying. One a bad day the 
lag between talk and listen makes all but the most conversation impossible.

I setup my VOIP unit on the inside of my firewall and the after hours of 
tech support, on the outside of my firewall.
It was a three month experience in frustration and tech support incompetence.
Now that it is over I am VERY suspicious of using Comcast as my bandwidth. 
I know many folks who have excellent Vonage service using DSL, but none who 
use comcast.

Best of luck.

  A colleague of mine in North Carolina tried VoIP on his cable connection
(comcast?). It was terrible on both his end and my end. Others he called
reported the same poor connections.

  After a few days he re-established is POTC line and has been much happier.

I used Vonage with Comcast for 7 months, December of 2003 to end of June 2004.

The month of February, we had major problems wiht poor reception,
broken calls, etc.  Not sure if it was a Vonage problem, or a comcast
problem, but it seemed to resolve itself.

As long as we didn't do a lot of big file transfers, our phone calls
would sound very acceptable.

There was a small problem of a slight buzzing on our handset, and
somewhere I read in Vonage technical support that particular cordless
phones do have some sort of humming.  Supposedly if we'd gotten a non
wireless phone, the problem would have gone away.  Never tried it tho.

The Vonage tech support response has been good.

I really like the feature set that Vonage provides, including the
ability to check voicemail via a webpage, and call forwarding to
anywhere.  There's a lot more options, but that's what jumps out at me
that I use quite a bit.

I've been extremely happy with Vonage.  I've got it setup at home in front
of my router.  This is the recommended setup so that the Motorola VoIP box
can prioritize the VoIP traffic.  I and others have not been able to tell
any difference between it and a regular POTS line.  I've also made
international calls and the quality is great.  The international rates are
better than most calling cards too.
No, I don't work for Vonage.  I've just been very happy with their service.

One other thing...  there's no contract, so if you're not happy with it
then you can call up and cancel immediately.

Am reasonably satisfied with the performance on a T1 line.  However had to
do some QOS on both sides so that the VOIP does not get stuttery when
downloading and saturating the link.  I have the Motorola ATA.

Voice quality, even on 80kbps, is of course not as good as POTS.  Better
than cell, but there is definitely a noticeable lag.  Most of my VOIP
packets head to a network in Phoenix, AZ (from PNW) and latency is only
40ms.  I think that there must be some significant other unseen distance
the packets fly generating the noticeable lag.  Voice collisions (both
parties talk at the same time because of the lag) happen often enough to
annoy me.

Price is good.  One thing that was not clear to me before ordering is that
Vonage does not charge you for incoming calls.  Thankfully most of my
minutes are incoming.  I have the $14.99/mo plan and never came close to
going over.

I can recommend it as a second line; my wife was tired of the POTS line
always being busy.  As an alternative (I have one of those multi-line
radio shack phones) it is worth the $15/mo plan.

What does "standard of presentation" mean?  Does it mean the aesthetic
effects of the general look-and-feel, rather than actual features?

I used to use SlickEdit, which has a Linux port.  That was basically
designed to look like Visual Studio, but I don't even like its look much
any more.

Besides which, most newer IDEs have a highly configurable UI.  The
Java-based JEdit (open source), for instance, can rearrange, dock or
float all of its child windows, and the text buffer area can have a
margin, line numbers, even a background image, depending on your
preferences.  Add to that all the different pluggable looks and feels
available in Java.  (My workmate sometimes looks at my monitor and asks
what IDE I'm using:  I tell him it's the same one he's using.)

Message-ID: <545931F80C27@loraksus.org>

Ok, to sum up my experiences
Vonage on Comcast - sucks, haven't tried dsl. That said, I continuously get
about 19ms ping to their servers, so there really shouldn't be any major
reasons for lag, but ok, whatever.

Vonage pass through / prioritize traffic mode - works great if you don't
mind resetting the damn box every 15 minutes. I had 2 of the Motorola's,
both randomly locked up, support was useless, so I said screw it and set it
up as below.

                        -> Vonage box on separate public (i.e. $3/mth) IP
DSL / Cable Modem -> Hub 
                        -> Rest of your network (router, etc)

That's not saying it won't work in another config, but it works reliably* in
this config. 

* As long as you keep the Motorola away from cordless phone base stations.
(I don't know why, but it works)

The Motorola's also only have 10 static port forwards and don't support upnp
iirc. There is a DMZ mode, but, again, passing a bunch of traffic through it
sucks.
Their rates - great. 
Their hold times for support - shitty (over 10-15 minutes). These are, of
course, cell phone minutes that you will be burning. 
Faxing? Well, if you want to fax, I'd advise a bottle of pepto bismol per
page.
Sound quality? Skype beats it hands down.

Brush up on your small claims court knowledge and try to get informed about
contract law. The law is a wee bit different in Washington, so you might
want to isolate your business to Oregon. 

I've done a fair bit on the side, but never really had the motivation needed
to do it on a full time basis. Most places are great to deal with, but the
~5% that are NPBs will cause you 99% of the angst and that sometimes makes
the job really suck. Try to talk to people in their industry, if a business
is going to screw you on money, they probably have done the same thing to
someone in the past (someone here maybe mentioned suppliers, other
contractors, etc).

I suppose there are also a bunch of guidelines to follow, they get the root
password after they pay, get EVERYTHING in writing, get people to sign off,
don't let their dumbass paper MCSE employees touch the server until everyone
signs off, etc, etc, etc. I'm sure other people have a comprehensive list. 
If you're going to do a maintenance agreement, be clear that that doesn't
cover Arthur knocking the server off a 5' table onto a concrete floor. Or
water damage. Or. . . 

If you have to hire someone to help you, be nice to them, be very nice and
pay really well. You probably will have to use them again, and if you were a
scrooge, they might have "other things to do". Just keep in mind you would
get nothing without them, so. . .

There are projects where you will want to run out screaming 5 minutes after
you walk in. Follow your gut and do so. Personally, I don't care if it means
eating mac and cheese with tuna for the next two weeks, $50/hr is not worth
coughing up blood from a newly formed ulcer. Don't be afraid to tell them
they need to clean up their server room / kill the dust bunnies / rats
before you will work in it / bring new hardware in. Bring a camera. Take a
lot of pictures.

You'll probably find yourself uninstalling spyware / porno ware for $45-$60
an hour as part of day to day operations. I sort of found a niche where
businesses that have an IT department located off site call me in to remove
adware, porno popups, and scrub their machines of crap in the history /
cache so they don't have to call their IT departments ;) I don't mind. It
helps to be discreet. A similar situation exists with housewives and / or
husbands, although sometimes it gets a little weird. 

If you were going to do this full time, I'd target home users, it's usually
easy and short work, but there are a lot more people who need help compared
to businesses. There really isn't much on-call support out there, and it is
very expensive, so undercutting established businesses with a brick and
mortar building in the area should not be difficult. 
You will probably do a lot more teaching than fixing for these folks too, so
communication skills help. 

Anyways. . .
Good Luck

How was your experience?  What were the major hurdles to getting started?
What methods did you use to solicit new business?  Was it a constant daily
chore to find new business or were you able acquire a solid base of
customers that provided enough work to keep food on the table?  Did you
run into any problems with other companies with similar names, and if so,
how was this resolved?  What was a typical day like?  There is an enormous
amount of differing technologies deployed and it's close to impossible to
be an expert in all areas, so if a customer had a tech need that you were
not proficient with, did you still take the work and learn on the job?
Any additional information would be greatly appreciated.

I was helping a friend clean up his computer one day and noticed a bunch of HTML docs that my
friend didn't recognize but were taking up a lot of hard-disk space.  In investigating, we
discovered that his son had some unusual sexual tastes AND had VD.  I felt *very* bad for his son.

The company I work for is heavily involved with VoIP and so we decided 
to give Vonage a try and attempt to go without a PBX in our office...It 
has been a QoS nightmare! When we first started using it we'd have cases 
where the Vonage side would just go silent for 10 to 20 seconds before 
we'd hear a voice again during a call. Other times the voices are quite 
jumpy to the point it was impossible to discern what the other party was 
saying. I thing part of the problem for our office is that there was 
some poor planning done and so the entire office, both data and VoIP, is 
done on a single T1. It also doesn't help that the Cisco router our ISP 
provided for our T1 has no QoS features available in it..

I figured with all of the office T1 limitations I'd give Vonage a try at 
home where I have Comcast Cable Modem Service. I tried a Win32 client on 
my XP laptop and while the quality of what I heard on my side was good, 
everyone that had to listen to me complained about lousey voice quality 
from my end of the call. For now I just keep my Vonage client 
unregistered and so anyone calling my office Vonage number gets me on my 
cell phone which has much better voice quality. Recently things were so 
bad that we had a few POTS lines installed in our office just so we have 
a few phones capable of decent QoS.

We're in the process of switching over to SIP IP phones in the office 
and those people that are lucky enough to have a handset say the voice 
quality is much better with a dedicated handset. I think some of the 
problems with the Vonage client that we have in the office (besides the 
single T1) is that WinXP seems to cause the gaps of silence in the 
Vonage call when other activities occur. e.g. Resize a window or do some 
work in another application while a call is in progress. We're adding a 
second T1 to our office which will be dedicated for our VoIP services 
and we have a dedicated Asterisks PBX Linux server in both our offices 
now so I'm hopeful that we'll finally have decent VoIP service in our 
office by the time we all get SIP phone handsets on our desks. It would 
be great to have a decent SIP phone client I could use on my laptop so I 
don't have to use my own personal Verizon Wireless minutes for company 
business but right now it's the only way to get reliable phone service 
for me.

I've posted my company's Vonage problems when others have asked about 
the service and I've received some pretty hateful comments for anonymous 
posters saying I didn't know what I was talking about and their 
experience has been great. I have to wonder if they're a Vonage shill or 
something if they post anonymously.

YMMV,

Tony

Darn Winders stuff.

Last place I contracted at was in the telephony business, and used
Asterisk servers pretty heavily.  Worked great.  They had a T1 split
between phone and internet backhaul to ELI, using an Asterisk box as a
PBX and to handle VoIP.  They were planning on switching to an Asterisk
box co-lo'd at ELI to terminate their phone lines (they already had a
block of phone numbers) and then trunking them via internet to an
Asterisk box at the office, which would act as a PBX.  Asterisk has a
really good trunking protocol.  Great for branch offices and such.

Asterisk, BTW, runs on Linux and FreeBSD.  Quite nicely, I might add,
with the Digium T1 cards.

A "who knew telephony would be so cool?" B

As a guy that learned BASIC and Pascal before I ever learned anything 
about C, I don't know if learning with Java is necessarily a bad thing 
IMHO.  Trying to learn C++ as a first programming language would make it 
very difficult on beginners. Perhaps people that have grown up around 
computers are much more capable than people were in my college days 
where we were babied on books like Karel the Robot before we even got to 
do any real Pascal coding on a CDC Cyber system.

For anyone that doesn't know anything about Karel the Robot more 
information can be found here:

http://www.mtsu.edu/~untch/karel/

I know I feel that I was a much better programmer with C since I learned 
it after having to walk the very straight and narrow path that Pascal 
forces upon the programmer and so I continued many of the good practices 
I learned in Pascal when I started doing C programming in 1984.

I myself think that I became a better C++ programmer after I learned java,
since java would not let me get away with all of the slippery pointer
tricks left over from my C days.

But...

My brother has complained to me of these young whippersnappers straight
out of college who forget to clean up their memory allocations in C++.

Oh, yeah, I've had a weird issue with the Motorola gateways they send you. 
As far as I can tell, Comcast's DHCP servers work like bootp servers, where
the ip given is linked to the MAC. Apparently multiple Motorola are sent out
with the same mac addy, which screws up dhcp for me and probably a bunch of
other people using their "fixed units" "out of the box".

I'm not sure if that is a screw-up on Motorola's end or on Vonage's end. I
wouldn't be surprised either way. The solution, is, of course, to spin the
magical wheel of mac addys, and pick one that is hopefully not being used by
a Comcast customer. Fun Fun FUC^BN!!!!

I'm pretty sure there is an ieee spec that is titled something like "Don't
ship multiple devices with the same mac addy dumbshits".

Hmm.  Valuing empiricism, I tried it:

   $ time (for i in $(seq 1 10000) ; do ; grep property < ucita200.txt > /dev/null ; done)
   (; for i in $(seq 1 10000); do; grep property < ucita200.txt > /dev/null; done  11.95s user 29.98s system 102% cpu 40.824 total

Slight, if inconsequential, advantage to the stdin redirection.  And
for comparison, here is the UUOC version:

   $ time (for i in $(seq 1 10000) ; do ; cat ucita200.txt | grep property > /dev/null ; done) 
   (; for i in $(seq 1 10000); do; cat ucita200.txt | grep property > /dev/null;   23.65s user 80.47s system 146% cpu 1:10.92 total

Subject: [PLUG] Vonage - VOIP
Message-ID: <BAY9-F40e7CGedQSzxw0005e6ec@hotmail.com>

I have Comcast and I put the Vonage box (Motorola ATA) in between
my router and my cable modem which is the recommended setup.
It has been setup since April and we really enjoyed the service.
Did not give us problem at all.  There were one day
that the service was down (while my internet is up) and
it was brought back up in a few hours.  Caller ID failed for
2 days but it was resolved upon rebooting the Motorola box.

Domestic and Canadian calls have GREAT quality.  International calls
were acceptable, not as good as domestic calls though.

I would highly recommend it and as is the case for us, we saved a lot
on our phone bill.  The feature set is also very handy.
We were travelling in June and also around July 4th
and all calls were forwarded to us just fine.

At PSU, CS202 does the latter half in Java (a recent change). Then the
compilers course is done entirely in Java. There are some others in
upper division as well.

Visual Studio has some really slick context-sensitive API
documentation features that are rare elsewhere (you can kind of get it
in emacs if you look deeply enough, but it's not nearly as
slick). Plus Microsoft has the advantage of total control over the
API's, eh? :-) I don't use Visual Studio really at all, so that's all
I know off the top of my head for features.

I bought a serial cable and a null-modem adapter at Radio Shack about

How many pins?

Radio Shack has null modem 9-pin adapters.  (They convert a 9-pin cable to 
null modem without having to buy a whole new cable.)

Oregon Electronics also has cables of various sorts.

What is even more fun, is floppy cables have two kinds of keying, a
missing pin and a "key" on the side of the connector.  I have seen
floppy drives, with a "punch-out" in the circut board next to the
connector to clear the external key, and said drive did not have the
"punch-out" punched. So the drive would accept an adapter that did not
have an enternal key, or a cable that did not have an external key, but
would force you to put a cable with an external key in the wrong way,
unless you removed the little bit of circut board.

Thanks for everyone's suggestions.  I ended up going to Oregon
Electronics.  They (I got two) might have been a little more expensive
than Radio Shack's (or maybe not), but the proprietor is much more
entertaining and he also gave me an idea for removing the broken off
tip of a charger connector that is currently stuck inside my
cellphone.  His parting words were: "I leave you to your devices".
Wonderful stuff!

I'm guessing you, like me, value a pop-up code-completion feature which
will show your Javadoc comments inline?  SlickEdit did this pretty well.
 JEdit has a few different plugins for it, but at this point, none of
them really works.  Idea can do it too, but that's no longer free.

I'm not sure about Eclipse or NetBeans, but I'd like to know.  People
who've never used such a feature just don't realize how expedient it is.

It also kind of communicates that you don't really know what you are
doing.  The UUOC is not harmful if you do it privately, but when you
paste it all over creation for the world to see (as might happen if
you are used to doing it privately), then damage to your credibility
may result.

Subject: [PLUG] transmitting double-floats over a socket
Message-ID: <86y8lem2h4.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I am working on a master-slave parallel processing problem.  The
master is running on an implementation of Scheme called Gauche, and
the slave is a C++ program.  I need to pass some of the results back
as double floats over the network socket.  What is a good way to
communicate them in a lossless way.  There is a function in
Scheme-land called (decode-float x) that returns three integer values
(m, e, s) such that s * m * 2^e reconstructs the float.  IEEE floats
make my head hurt.  Is there an easy way to construct these three
integers in C?  Is there another, better way?  I know I could just
printf("%.53g",x) (or <some other bignum>) but that is so graceless.

Any ideas?

Thanks!

I recently switched from Evolution to Thunderbird. Have had no problems. 
I haven't tried news.aracnet.com specifically.

Another graceless suggestion would be to find the IEEE binary datatype
definition and then use bitmasking and bitshifting to extract the
three integers and spit them out. That's just me talking without
putting more than about five minutes thought into it, though.

Okay you folks made me woozy, I hope you are proud.

This actually seems to have gotten easier since the last time I
remember working on this, due to the ever handy long long (64-bit
integer).

It amounts to this:

union decode {
   double d;
   unsigned long long l;
};

void
print_decoded_double(double value) {
   union decode v;
   
   v.d = value;
   unsigned sign = v.l >> 63;
   signed exponent = v.l << 1 >> 53; 
   unsigned long long mantissa = v.l << 12 >> 12;

   if(exponent)
      mantissa |= (unsigned long long) (1 << 20) << 32;

   exponent -= 1023 + 52; // 1st part exponent bias, 2nd mantissa bias

   printf("(* %d %llu (expt 2d0 %d))",  // or equivalent
      sign ? -1 : 1, mantissa, exponent);

   return;
}

Doesn't voice over POTS only use about 2400 baud?  
I don't see why Vonage would require more 
bandwidth than POTS, unless packet overhead is
making a big difference.  Doesn't Vonage work 
over udp?  With Comcast, are Vonage packets 
not being favored adequately over the packets 
of other bandwidth intensive applications?  

With the shared bandwidth aspect of cable, 
is anything being done by Comcast to control 
bandwidth hogging?

Is there latency because POTS is a full duplex signal
where Vonage is only half duplex?

Can Vonage service be ordered without committing to 
Comcast's cable Internet and TV services?  That 
$15/mo is deceptive if you have to order other 
services.      



The speed cable Internet is quoted at, is that 
the speed the cable infrastructure runs at, or 
only a fraction of it?  There are a number of 
comparisons between cable and DSL on the radio, 
etc. The comparison of apples to oranges makes 
me wonder what to really believe.  DSL bandwidth
is private where cable bandwidth is public.
The use of cable bandwidth is also more 
politically restrictive than DSL, or at least 
that's what I've been led to believe.

What POTS and DSL cost is a concern, but the 
cable companies clearly lack the reputation 
and possibly consumer interest to compete in 
non traditional areas.  I don't see cable 
extending beyond television rapidly in very 
many areas.  I haven't read very many 
testimonials yet of satisfaction with 
cable Internet and other non television 
cable services in this thread.



In my area...

CenturyTel forces purchase of POTS service 
because the line maintenance methods used 
don't include checking to see if there 
is only a DSL signal.  If the 
pair running your DSL got grabbed to replace 
another line, that probably wouldn't go over 
too well.  It's annoying to be forced into 
POTS though because it runs about $30/mo.  
That's extended, but not being able to 
call locally outside of Scappoose would 
be really inconvenient.  I don't think 
you can get an extended line and add 
a second one without.  You'd only 
save $12 a month, though you could 
probably drop call waiting too.
The cheapest for a second 500k DSL
line in Scappose would probably be
$63/month by the time you get the
phone line to run it on.

A DS0 (single line) is 64Kbps.  One bit is used for signalling, so you get
7 bits for data and 8000 bytes per second.  That gives you 56Kbps for
voice -- 8KHz sampling rate, mono, 7 bit.

Vonage can be run over your existing broadband internet connection.  It's
not related to Comcast.

Talk to your telephone company.  There is usually a very limited line that
can be hand for just a few dollars each month... this is the kind of line
used for alarm systems and the like.  They are usually associated with
VERY high per use charges.

Why would you need a second DSL line?  Just upgrade your bandwidth. I can
get 6 megabits.

My ability to authenticate on news.aracnet.com has been pretty hit-or-miss 
for at least the last 2 weeks.  I'm able to connect and authenticate right 
now (using trn).  But I've had lots of problems recently.

David,

  Interesting. I've had no problems using slrn, but I don't check newsgroups
every day.

  My question was poorly worded: I don't know where and how to put the
authentification into thunderchicken. We tried her username and aracnet
password but it kept refusing them. Perhaps the problem is on their side.

Thanks,

Rich

It is the equivalent of sprinkling your mathematical expressions with
additions of zero or multiplications of one.  The gratuitously
encumbered expressions create an identical result, and yet they are
harder to read for the visual noise.

If you don't do it with mathematical expressions, why do it with shell
programming?

  I suppose that everyone here has read that Microsoft will return $75
billion to investors via stock re-purchases, dividend increases and a
one-time distribution.

  To put this in perspective, consider the door prize they contribute to the
BizJournal's monthly Power Breakfasts: a pair of mice. Must cost them all of
$5 for the pair. Other sponsors give away a dozen roses, Nordstrom gift card
($50 minimum), tickets to cultural events and so on. Microsoft gives away a
pair of mice. Sheesh! Glad my card's not been drawn for those.

Thanks, it is certainly an improvement in grace over the

<devils-advocate>It is not exactly that.  Adding "+ 0" or "* 1" to a
mathematical expression is entirely gratuitous, whereas "cat x |" is
not.  Either that or "< x" is required.

In some cases, using cat may actually be easier to read (it is to me,
but perhaps only because I'm more used to it).  In the OOPL world, we
encourage intuitive, readable code, even at the expense of performance.

As I understand it, these kinds of actions have the effect of pumping
up the market price of remaining available stock. Then officers can
sell off their own personal shares at an increased profit. So I
wouldn't consider this some kind of altruistic door prize. :-)

Also to get the bonus, you had to have been holding the stock for a while.

It will definitly boost morale there for all those employees who have been 
holding stock and not seeing alot out of the experience.

I think they are also heading off criticism for holding so much cash in 
reserve while not paying dividends until quite reciently.

  Door prizes at a business breakfast pumping up share price? I'd be very
surprised. I know that I was disappointed to see them sign on as a sponsor,
but I suspect it's because they're taking such a beating down here vis-a-vis
schools and government.

We're capped at 800 kb/s, it's $30/month extra to go from 500 to 800.
You pay enough for the upgrade in Scappose, you can just about 
get a second line and rent a second router.  If you want a megabit 
via DSL in Scappoose, you have to use two lines.  We have
a $25/month 5 ip subnet ( actually it's an 8 ).  Drop the subnet
back down to 1 ip adding the cost of the 300k upgrade, that's
$45-50.  If you go with 256k service, that gives you close 
to as much as the upgrade with a second phone, course you're 
trading off ip addresses.  The $4/month alarm line idea is 
a good one if you can receive faxes on it.  

If we can do Vonage and drop all the EAS, etc. off of our
existing phoneline, that may offer a nice alternative.

It *is* entirely gratuitous to run a whole program to create a data
stream when a '<' will do just as nicely without running the extra
program, and really just as clearly.  

The 'cat' program is there to string multiple files together.  It is
*sometimes* used to blurt the contents of a file onto the screen for
inspection, but as soon as you have another program to feed it to, a
simple '< foo' is better.</>

No, stock buy-back programs and dividend bonuses.

This isn't "pumping up" in the gratuitous, pump and dump sense.  For the 
investor both the dividend and stock buy back are GoodThings.

The dividend returns cash to your pocket.  All other things being equal
this makes shares of the stock more valuable.

The buy back program means that the shares you hold represent a fractionally
larger portion of the enterprise.  Again, all other things being equal,
each share is more valuable.

Penguin Day, as it's being called, follows a format laid down at the 
first Penguin Day in Philly earlier this year. We'll be doing some 
interactive discussions in the morning and some hands on presentations 
in the afternoon.

The target audience is nonprofit IT staff, nonprofit IT consultants, 
developers and funders. If you are or know someone who would benefit 
from this event please pass along the invitation. More info can be found at:

Does that actually work? Back when I worked on compilers the language
lawyers in the company said that those results were undefined, and
that after passing through the optimizer you were pretty much guaranteed
garbage. From a practical standpoint it might work, but the language

I have no idea.  IANALL.  ;-)

I am having a hard time seeing how it couldn't work (at least in this
simple case).  Can you explain?

Hmm.  My Harbison&Steele,2ed says that "It is _not_ portable to assign
one union component and then reference another component".  And the
WG14/N843 committee draft (August 3, 1998) says in Section 6.5.2.3
(5): "With one exception, if the value of a member of a union object
is used when the most recent store to the object was to a different
member, the behavior is implementation-defined."  Evidently this union
technique is called "type-punning", and apparently it works on GCC.

I am only intending to use GCC, so I guess I am relatively safe.

Anyway, what is the alternative?

chaz,

  Groklaw has two eye-witness accounts from folks who showed up specifically

I could easily see where, especially if there wasn't any persistent 
storage involved, the compiler might treat v.d as a reference to a
floating point register and v.l as a reference to an integer register.
There's no dependency between the different parts of the union, so
the initial value could get stored in the floating point register and
the rest operates on the random garbage in the integer register. 

> Anyway, what is the alternative? 

Use pointers?

 double d;
 unsigned long long *l;
 l = (unsigned long long *)&d;

 unsigned sign = *l >> 63;
 signed exponent = *l << 1 >> 53; 
 unsigned long long mantissa = *l << 12 >> 12;

The answer is it will "usually" work, for varying definitions of usually
and work.

ANSI has changed, just not that part ;-)
After a quick perusal of the C99 standard, I can't find anything
specifically addressing it, but I have a memory of it being defined as
undefined ;-) There is a line that says a union may hold the value of at
most one of its members, but that a pointer to a union object, suitably
converted, points to each of its members.

So 

union { double d; int i; } u;
int i;

u.d = 1.0;
i = u.i;       /* invalid */
i = *(int*)&u; /* valid? */

> I am having a hard time seeing how it couldn't work (at least in this
> simple case).  Can you explain?

The standard also says that any storage belonging to one member of a
union but not another is left in an unspecified state.  On GCC ix86
double and long long are the same size, but that's not guaranteed.  If
they are of different sizes, the values stored in the "extra" bytes are
undefined and could lead to problems.  Essentially, the standard says
that from the compiler's perspective the only "type" that matters is the
type of the last assigned member.  Except when you're dealing with
pointers and sizeof() ;-P

Pointers is your best option, although I personally lean towards using
"unsigned char" which the C standard says is the only guaranteed
conversion that won't change the bit representation (like casting to
int), especially if you're just transmitting them over a socket.  Then
again, if you're just transmitting them over a socket casting the
address to a void* and using sizeof(double) will work just fine.

Years ago when I was working at OSI on their NetExpert product my first 
assignment was working on the interprocess message handling daemon. At 
the time it was done using ONC RPC. I found an ONC RPC book from OReilly 
that was invaluable to me since I had mosly just toyed around with doing 
some simple RPC interfaces The messaging daemon was very serious stuff 
so I figured I needed a real reference book with lots of meat. We cached 
messages in the daemon if a destination process wasn't registered or was 
down and if the unsent message count grew too large we'd write the 
messages to files for later retrival. 

Nowadays if I need to do any sort of messaging in a client/server 
environment I use a CORBA ORB (usually omniORB) and write interfaces 
using IDL. For quick and somewhat dirty through I suppose ONC RPC would 
be OK as well but it's been years since I used RPCs. I've held on to my 
OReilly RPC book as I didn't know if it's still in print  or not.

FWIW I did find it listed on their website still so maybe it is 
available altough for simpe ONC RPC programming there must be something 
free on the web (I didn't look):

<while-the-discourse-is-good,-the-problem-has-been-solved>
Guys,

The two biggest problems have been addressed. The original problem: which was 
pointed out to me as a fairly easy one or two line bash script. And the one 
of ignorance: which had to do with a better way to do it. In other words, I 
learned something in the process. (a few things, actually.) 

Now in my case, the UUOC wasn't as big of an issue, as my desktop machine (the 
one in question,) spends most of it's life bored out of it's skull.  However, 
I agree that in a server environment squeezing operations out of every single 
cycle possible is what is strived for. 

But let's call it a victory, already. Maybe over a brew, (or not,) 
Whaddya say?

Oh, I am planning to have the C++ slave side send the numbers in ASCII
text representing the three integers.  The Gauche/Scheme master side
wouldn't know (I don't think) what to do with a binary double.

In Lisp-land, there is a pair of papers from 1990 about printing and
reading floats in such a way as to guarantee the same value goes all
the way around.

  "How to Read Floating Point Numbers Accurately", William D. Clinger

and 

  "How to print floating point numbers accurately", Guy Steele,
  Jr. and Jon L White.

I know this one will be a snap for some of yous:  what's the proper
header for threading emails?  I'm on a certain mailing list, and when I
last posted, I got a reply with "Re: " prepended to the subject, as
usual.  Yet my client, Sypheed claws, did not correlate it, as it
normally does (it appears at the bottom of the folder, rather than
indented below my message).

The headers from both emails are below.  It looks like "Thread-Index" is
what most clients are using, but my email has an "X-ELNK-Trace" instead.
 Is that wrong, as I suspect?  Whether or no, replies to my emails are
usually threaded properly, so I'm perplexed over this case.

Well, I'm not sure how the "Thread-Index" and "Thread-Topic" headers are
supposed to be used, but the header that is most frequently used is the
"In-Reply-To" header in combination with the "Message-Id" from the email
that the reply is "in reply to".

Also, Outlook doesn't generate the In-Reply-To, so it's not your MUA,
it's the sender's.

I see.  So should I surmise that In-Reply-To is the (de facto?)
standard, and that M$ Outhouse (TM) is playing the usual M$ Game (TM) by
using Thread-Index instead?

I've never heard of Thread-Index before.  In-Reply-To is just the
MessageID of the message to which one is replying.  It's really the only
sensible way to thread because it's independent of subject (to
keep appropriate subject headers in straying threads) and can be
constructed from ANY valid email message.

The RFC822 and now RFC2822 standard, so more that defacto.  As of July
22, 2004, RFC822 is the Official Internet Protocol Standard, and 2822
is a Proposed Standard.  See:

  <http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfcxx00.html>

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0407221300020.12498-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I was asked by a teacher at a private school about a text book and/or 
curriculum for a High School level computer class.  What they are using 
now is -- in her words - "pretty lame".

I pointed her at SEUL but that seems to be more about the software tools
using Linux than the course content and it covers may topics.  (I haven't
looked at SEUL in depth for quite awhile.)  Anyone have suggestions of
websites that might be helpful?

Dear All:

I know Cygwin has X shipped with it and I enjoy using it.
But Cygwin has so many other stuff that sometimes I just
want to display X traffic onto my Windows client
(remote is some sort of Unix hosts).

Is there another X client I can use besides Cygwin?

Rod,

  Have you any idea what they want to cover in this class? Options include
how computers work, introduction to programming, computer use in business
and industry and ... ad infinitum. The appropriate text depends on the
information to be covered.

Message-ID: <410024A4.3080909@comcast.net>

Hey Guys,

Here is what I would like to do.

I have two 200GB SATA drives.  The first drive contains all of my Fedora 
install.  The second drive is currently blank, no partitions, no 
nothing.  I'm going to turn this system into an email server, but we 
don't really care if we do regular backups on the server since email 
comes and goes it would be a moving target.  What I want to do though is 
copy everything from the first drive to the second drive and make it so 
that if the first drive dies, I can switch to the second drive with 
little effort and pickup pretty much were we left off.  So what 
programs/processes can I run to clone the first disk to the second disk?

Thanks in Advance.

(Actually, the Windows box is the X Server.  The *nix box is the client.  X
is a little strange about the client/server roles.) 

  I use the commercial product "Hummingbird Exceed 9.0" to remote X
applications to Windows from Solaris and Linux workstations.  

Exceed Family 
http://www.hummingbird.com/products/nc/exceed/index.html

  You'll need the "Connectivity Secure Shell" software if you want to run
over an SSL tunnel.

  You may also want to look into VNC if you don't care to purchase
commercial software.  There are Open Source VNC clients for Windows.  The
modern Linux distro's seem to come out of the box with VNC installed.

Uh, woah.  200GB for email?  I'll trade you two 15GGBs... I promise you
won't run out of space.

Well, you could just make a CD of the final installation and copy out /etc
every so often.

Hell, you could run it off a CD with a shared memory filesystem for /tmp
and bits of /var and just make a big RAID mirror out of the other two
drives.

Sounds to me like you've got way more hardware than you need, though.

And I really can't recommend not running backups on your mail server.
Lots of people use IMAP clients and keep everything on the server.

You want to set up a RAID1 mirror between the drives.  On the second
drive, create partitions with the same geometry as the first drive. 
You'll have to read up a bit on configuring RAID & MD (multple devices)
if you're not familiar with it.  In short, create a one-device MD for
each of your partitions (except swap).  Then create filesystems on each
MD.  Then mount them in your running system, and use cp/tar/rsync/etc in
single-user mode to copy your existing filesystems onto the new ones. 
Then modify your fstab, grub config, etc. for the second drive and boot
into the RAID devices on the second drive.  Finally, add the partitions
from the first drive to the raidtab and let the mirror be
reconstructed.  (It'll take a good while w/200GB.)

For swap, just make two swap partitions and enable them both to have the
same priority with 'pri=1' in the fstab.

They were (she was) kind of vague but knew that the current book /
curriculum was too simple/elementary for todays students.  There was
mention of a room full of older computers that might be usable as hardware
teaching tools and/or turned into Internet access systems etc.

I was making a shot from the dark into the dark hoping the technologically 
advanced NW Oregon area might have already addressed this issue.  :-)

Rod,

  The "issue" has been addressed. What is needed to be helpful is to
identify _which_ issue is of concern to her. ;-)

  I'm not being facetious; there are so many possibilities that one cannot
provide a satisfactory answer without more details. Of course, linux would
almost certainly run on the older equipment (unless they're Commodore PETs
or Apple ][es, of course). Why don't you point her to the K-12 linux Web
site?

I was being a little facetious with the dark to dark.  I remember
(found-again) http://www.k12ltsp.org/.  Are there others off the top of
anyones head I should tell her about?  I don't want to do too much of

Hi all,

My apologies for the off topic message, but the vice president of our company promised the head of
another company that a problem with one of our services will be fixed by noon.  Then I was told
that I was going to fix it (on a product I've never touched, no less.)

On a Blackberry Wireless, I'm getting the following error message when surfing one of our Web
sites:

  WAP Session Abort 8:
  User Acknowledgement not received.

We have no documentation and I've been googling like mad to find the meaning of the error, but no
luck.  Can anyone offer pointers?

Cheers,
Ovid

Rod,

  I thought you were in Spokane. Was there an earthquake that shifted it to
Idaho? Besides, it's only about a 7-hour drive to here. IIRC, we had some
educators from Cave Junction (down by Medford, a 6+ hour drive away) come
for a Saturday clinic.

  Think of it as an excuse for a weekend away. :-)

Work in Spokane, live in Idaho.  I've done the old one-dayers before.

Google for "WTP User Acknowledgement".  There is some info.  

  I'm no WAP expert, but I'd say that you're WAP (Wireless Access Protocol)
site is operating in WTP (Wireless Transaction Protocol) User
Acknowledgement mode.  It looks like you're not receiving a User
Acknowledgement within the timeout period.  

  I'd say contact the vendor of the server side software and find out what
the "Abort 8" means and what conditions generate that error.  (Maybe...
Suspended?)  You may be able to tweak the server side code to get it out of
end-to-end acknowledgement mode.  

  The WAP Forum guys wrote the specs.  It may be difficult to get the actual
docs without paying or joining.  

Open Mobile Alliance (WAP Forum)

This may work...

Actually, you want an X server to run under Windows, not an X client.
And yeah, there's one... it has a hummingbird for its logo, it may even
be called hummingbird, I think.  Hmmm... maybe it was a butterfly?
Anyway, it wasn't free.  I think there used to be a third one, as well.

IMHO, Cygwin is the only real viable option, given its cost and the fact
that it works.

The X server was called Humingbird Exceed. It's neither free or cheap 
and so Cygwin does the job very well IMHO. Exceed is still avaiable but 
I don't know how popular it is nowt given that Cygwin has a pretty 
decent X server that's free. I did use Exceed it when I worked a 
contract at Boeing CAG in Seattle and had Win2K machine. At tjhe company 
I work for now which is a startup we use PuTTY for ssh CLI session and 
Cygwin when we need to run X stuff from our Linux servers. We had some 
people whining about Cygwin as they wanted to have a more tightly 
integrated X solution with the Windows desktop but they lost out 
beccause of the  the high cost of Exceed compared to the Cygwin solution.

Many of our people in engineering are Unix/Linux users and so they like 
having Cygwin to given whem a Unix-like interface on their WinXP laptops 
although we have a number of defectors that have flattened their laptops 
and have installed Linux and are getting buy without Windows at all.

Message-ID: <20040723045428.72598.qmail@web50604.mail.yahoo.com>

I use Qwest DSL for Internet access, using a Cisco 678
modem. This arrangement has been satisfactory.
However, if the modem doesn't last forever, and I
continue to use Qwest, they would replace it with an
Actiontec GT701-wg. Do some members of this list
currently use the Actiontec? If so, how well does it
work with Linux?

The reason I ask is that Cisco modems are still
available through Ebay and other sources, and if the
Actiontec future looks dismal, I suppose some would
recommend getting another Cisco before they disappear.
I unplug the one I currently use when no one is using
a computer, in the belief that allowing it to cool
will extend its life.

Some of my partners have them; they seem to work okay.  Well, I cannot
attest to the exact model, but it is the Actiontec with PCMCIA slot for
wireless.  You have to buy Actiontec's wireless card, but it works and
is okay.  We haven't had too many problems with it, and we've frequently
had half a dozen systems between the wired and wireless networks at a
time (mostly wireless).  I found a "fun" feature of the built-in DHCP
server that it won't if it's configured to hand out only a single DNS
address; duplicating the same IP made it work though.

The 675's definitely had cooling problems.  My 678 has been in more or
less continuous operation in my basement in 24x7 operation for over 3
years.

To let it speak for itself, I have 3 Actiontec DSL
adapters sitting brand new, in box, never used.
On the contrary, I have setup dozens of people with
Cisco 678's I acquired through Ebay, or other means :)

The Actiontec adapters seem alright, all-in-one solution
for basic home uses is all. But I trust the Ciscos far
more, reliability, and speed. Keep em cool yah, those
678's get pretty hot (not sure if it affects their life
expectancy though)

Either can be used.  One nice feature of the References header is that

I had one fail after about 6 months, and I think heat was a factor.
Since then, I've had its replacement variously propped on top of
pencils to increase airflow underneath, and now cable-tied to an old
inverted drive cage which provides a *lot* more airflow underneath.
And as long as I don't change my Qwest service in *any* way, I've got
two backup 675s ready to go in case this one fails.

Yeah.  Just out of curiosity, isn't Lessig also a lawyer for Software in the

I've been using one for maybe six months.  It was a pain to set up,
but has been fine since.  IIRC there were three adjustments I had to
make in order to live with it.

1) The firmware isn't very reliable and every few days the thing gets
   into a state where you need to power-cycle it.  So I bought a $9
   lamp timer at RadioShack in order to preemptively cycle it every
   night.  I can now travel for a week and always have access back in;
   without the timer I'd lose connectivity after maybe three days.

2) I use ez-ipupd to bind my Qwest-assigned dynamic IP address to a
   domainname.  In order to get the IP address off of the Actiontec I
   had to write a script using wget that scrapes it off of the browser
   interface.  Another script runs every five minutes and calls
   ez-ipupd if the address has changed, as it sometimes does.

3) The Actiontec by default wants to be your router, firewall, DHCP
   server, etc. -- but unfortunately isn't as good at those as LEAF, a
   floppy-based firewall project.  Configuring the thing to get out of
   the way wasn't easy.  IIRC it meant turning off some stuff,
   assigning my router a static IP and then forwarding all ports to
   that IP.  Surprisingly, some of the Qwest tech support people were
   helpful with this.

There's another one that I often use (because CygWin is annoying)
called WinaXe.  It's cheap and works quite well.

There are/were several commercial X servers for windows; people have
already mention Hummingbird's Exceed, which was decent when I toyed with
it 6-7 years ago. Long ago (win 3.1) days, I used WRQ's Reflection X
(their Reflections series supports a lot of oddball terminal emulation,
which my job at the time required).  Dunno if it's still the case, but
Reflection X let you use either Windows or whatever *nix window manager
of your choice (running on the remote host, of course) to manage your
desktop -- it was an odd experience to have to have my win 3.1 apps
running within a SunOS openwin desktop in 1995.

Exceed is indeed not cheap.  However, I does a very good job of operating in
complex visual environments.  I ran into this when evaluating X servers for
use as enterprise management consoles.  OpenView (the IM software in use)
would overwhelm the other products we tried.  Only Exceed would stay up.
You have to need it pretty bad to put up with the cost though...

I've recently solved this problem for a DBA by switching to a Linux
desktop and using VMware for the few Windows apps he needs... ;)  VMware
Workstation is a good deal cheaper than than Exceed.

This question make me think to ask how is Ed doing. I see the alcpress.com 
site is up but I don't want to bother him if there is still a lot of 
recovery to do.

So does anyone have experience with 'Classless IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation' -
RFC 2317.

I have some instructions from our upstream provider and the rfc in front
of me but I'm getting no where quickly with lots of work.  I did find at
least one serious typo so I am beginning to have doubts about how valid
their instructions actually are.

Since this isn't all that applicable to most people I'm prefectly willing 
to take the discussion off list.


TIA,
Rod

I'm sure many of us have some experience with CIDR, but you never

Might be possible with sme of the Helix project libraries.  I have not 
tried doing that sort of conversion.  (Mainly because most real movie 
formats i have used are so compressed as to be almost worthless.)

You might also look at Mplayer.  It might have something useful.  It will 
be pretty hacky, but it might work.

I don't know about VCD, but my mencoder (part of Mplayer) will reencode 
RealMedia files to whatever output formats it supports. You do need some 
libraries, but I don't know what they are because my Gentoo picked them 
up automatically.

Subject: [PLUG] A CUPS problem
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0407231939370.2209@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I've been trying to print a pdf file of a purchased book. The printer
stopped after the frontmatter, then after the summary, then after chapter 1.
Each time, CUPS (via /usr/sbin/printers) showed the parallel port was busy.
So, I killed the process, then the jobs in the queue and restarted
everything.

  Now, however, CUPS sees that printer as waiting for the parallel port to
become un-busy, but it never times out. There is no parallel port process
open. I cannot -- as a user or as root -- delete that printer definition and
recreate it. The latter used to be my last-ditch remedy. I deleted the line
for that printer definition in /etc/printcap but it makes no difference. The
printer is stuck with a non-existent problem and everything is hung up.

  Does anyone have a suggestion to get the printing system working again?
Stopping and re-startig CUPS doesn't help. Neither did a reboot! I'm
stymied.

Thanks,

Rich

  Fixed the little bugger. I edited /etc/cups/printers.conf and changed the
status from 'stopped' to 'idle', removed the status message, then restarted
cups.

  Why it hangs up printing this 424-page document I've no idea.

Here is a link I have used for a /27 which works fine.  The $GENERATE

the rest of the /24 that is not yours.

You're obviously using some definition of "cool" of which I was previously
unaware.

I implemented this a long while ago, where normaly reverse would not be
totaly delegated to you, this was a way to "cheat".

For more info, you can direct e-mail me, and I can pull up notes on
how exactly we did it, but right now my mind is running thin.

I was looking for a clue and after several more hours I tripped and hit 
myself with the (clue-)stick.  It still isn't working completely but I did 
get a portion of it to work.
   The issue was with the instruction I got from our upstream provider.  
They had me name a domain entry incorrectly.  Theeefore the 'pointer' they
had made pointed to the wrong thing.  I'm still pretty new to this as our
other major upstream provider does the reverses -- even the subclassed
ranges -- differently.
   It now works from the primary name server system when I do a dig +trace
-x 1.2.3.4 so I think my other mon-working portion is a cache issue on the
other name servers.

My head hurts so I'll probably stop pounding it against the wall for a 
bit.  Do a little yard work and let teh back-brain work on it.

Thanks to Chris, Steven, and Brent for the time to make me think more 
clearly.

Here is a link to a locally developed curriculum called Cyber Awareness

about computers. I believe this particular course is 8-10 1 hour sessions.
Contact me if you want to get in touch with any of the Editors/Authors.

Those deathstar drives tend to have a long warranty, you can probably get it

FWIW, the hard disk in my primary workstation is a Deathstar (Deskstar
75GXP 20GB drive) and has been running nicely for years without
incident.

It does (about once every three months) start making a funky chirping
noise, but it's done that off and on since the drive was six months old
and it hasn't caused it any issues.

Of course, I keep nothing important on the disk... I *am* just waiting
for it to die.

No, I don't mean that the PC speaker was chirping, I mean the drive
was chirping, kind of a "seek" chirp.  Other drives still working
fine.

Thanks for saying that.  I'd assumed they were long out of warranty,
but just now checking it looks like they are both good til Jan 16,
2005.  

Woohoo, free hardware!  I wonder what they are going to replace them
with?  Now all I have to do is locate some acceptable packing
material.  Sigh.

I'm experiencing a networking problem running UML (user-mode-linux).
ping is working, but tcp-based apps aren't.  I've used tcpdump on my
router to determine that packets from uml are being passed to the WAN,
but tcpdump on the other end says they never arrive.  So something
about packets from the uml instance causes them to get dropped
somewhere after they leave my network.

The setup:

Internet       ActionTec        LEAF             Debian Desktop
via      <-->  DSL       <-->   router/   <-->   with UML
Qwest          Modem            firewall         instance "inside"
                          ^
                          |
                          +-- packets get this far, then disappear.

uml communicates with its host via a bridge.  The host (bridge) is
192.168.1.3, and the uml instance uses 192.168.1.253.  The router's
LAN interface is 192.168.1.254.  Networking within the LAN works fine,
and the uml instance appears to be a full-fledged member of the LAN.
It can ping and telnet to both its host and other machines, and all of
them can ping it.  (There are no servers on it for others to try
connecting to.)

Telnet packets leave the uml instance, cross the bridge and are routed
(and NATted) by the LEAF firewall.  They are then passed to the DSL
modem.  I have no way of tracing them beyond this point, but know that
they don't reach the telnet server on the other side.  Qwest tech
support (which was both clueful and helpful) didn't see any way the
modem could be interfering, but also didn't have the ability to check
whether my packets were making it to the first hop on their network.

Other hosts on my lan, including the machine the uml instance lives
on, can telnet to that same server just fine.

It's quite possible that I've screwed uml<-->host networking up, but
I'm out of my depth understanding how.  For example, the flags are
different on the tcp packets leaving the LEAF firewall.  Here are one
from the uml instance and one from another host.  The one with SWE
flags gets dropped, and the one with just S for flags gets through.

22:19:15.926143 192.168.0.9.1027 > c-67-160-213-181.client.comcast.net.telnet: SWE 943229592:943229592(0) win 5840 <mss 1460,sackOK,timestamp 25444 0,nop,wscale 0> (DF) [tos 0x10] 

22:19:21.958940 192.168.0.9.1046 > c-67-160-213-181.client.comcast.net.telnet: S 1098209015:1098209015(0) win 5840 <mss 1460,sackOK,timestamp 739556 0,nop,wscale 0> (DF) [tos 0x10] 

I don't know enough about TCP to make sense of this, but will start
reading.  Any other suggestions?  Has anybody seen this before, or
something like it?

Thanks,

--Eric

They, *ahem* have a couple laying around. If they are the "pre-Hitachi IBM"
drives, they had something like a 30% failure rate. 
The turnaround is about 2-3 weeks.

Thanks for saying that.  I'd assumed they were long out of warranty,
but just now checking it looks like they are both good til Jan 16,
2005.  

Woohoo, free hardware!  I wonder what they are going to replace them
with?  Now all I have to do is locate some acceptable packing
material.  Sigh.

Everyone's favorite answer, it depends. Once you've covered the cost of
the drive, DVD media is cheaper per unit of data. For small amounts of
data DVDs will also be lighter. Also no concerns about destroying DVDs
from a small shock.

OTOH, with a hard disk gives you a tremendous amount of data in a small
package. You can stick >200GB in a pretty small package. Also it is a
single blob for all that data rather than a stack of disks. Faster for
reading and writing. More expensive initially though.


Note, go for an 8x (or faster) dual format drive. The 8x drives have a
laser powerful enough to write DVD+R-DL media (dual layer), slower drives
won't be able to write them.

All your favorite stores. ENU. If you're willing to risk being fried
then Fry's has the $80 DVD drive of the week special.

Long post, but if you want a 120gb drive for $45, scroll to the bottom. 

Personally, most of the stuff I burn is home movies and the such, and the
DVD is really handy for that. That said, I'd probably go for the hard drive
if I didn't have 7 in my box right now ;)

The only real issues with dvds is that 
1. It's a pain to get the data back / use it.
2. The failure rate on DVD+-Rs

#1 really can't be avoided, so if you need access to the data when you
aren't around to insert the DVD, you'll probably go for the hard drive. 

#2 isn't an issue if you're burning fault tolerant data (dvd-video, "raid"
sets in backups, etc
There is a program that creates "raid" sets, which is really damn slow, but
works pretty well. It's a sourceforge project that I don't remember the name
of right now, but is pretty cool.

An external drive is really nice if you do multiple backups and can walk
around with the enclosure. 
I would reccomend getting an enclosure with a standard power cable (i.e.
same as to your computer and monitor) so you don't have to drag a wall wart
around - or, better yet, get one that runs on battery power (I use a 20gb
archos mp3 player that I got off Amazon for $120, it is tiny and works great
as both an external hdd and a mp3 player, I usually leave the big external
drive at home) 

If you have data that you don't just want to archive, go for an internal hdd
and get an enclosure. You can usually save quite a bit of money going that
way, see the end of my email for details about the $75 120GB drive ;)

Of course, if you're going to talk about dvds, there is the issue of media
to consider. You could use the cheap crap, but DVD-R's are about $65 for 100
if you buy the good stuff and realistically, that is what you will want to
buy. 
(If you buy the cheap stuff, in ~6-8 months you will see CRC errors on some
areas on about ~10-15% of the disks. That is a real pain in the ass. Of
course, hard drives take power, generate heat, noise and can also crash and
then you lose all your data as opposed to 15% * x# of dvds)

If you're going to buy anything, forget FRYd, the last 4 times I've gone
there to buy something, I've had to come back and deal with little Napoleon
Anthony, their wanna be manager / motherfucker in charge of "FRYd Return
World".
Yes, Anthony, if you're reading this, when the revolution comes, I'll be the
one going MUHAHAHA as they escort you to your very own lamp post.

I digress. 

Save yourself some gas money and avoid it. Their prices aren't that great
either. ENU's prices are usually better and I think they pay their employees
a little better Frys does.

If you want to go online, I trust newegg, so go for something like the NEC
2510 dual layer +- etc etc for $76. 

http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp?DEPA=0&description=27-152-025&
ATT=CD+DVD+Burners+RW+Dr&CMP=OTC-B1zrat3

or a liteon w/everything for $85
http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp?DEPA=0&description=27-106-952&
ATT=CD+DVD+Burners+RW+Dr&CMP=OTC-B1zrat3

Dual layer media is still expensive, who knows how well it will work out /
and the real shelf life of the disks at this point. 

If you're going to buy a hard drive, wait for a deal to come out on the
forums at fatwallet.com. Great place, you might have to do some work, but it
is worth it to get a 120GB HDD for $45.

Actually, you don't have to wait ;)
http://fatwallet.com/t/18/341370/

$75 out of pocket for a 120 GB drive. There is also a $30 rebate on the
drive, which puts the price after 6 months and hours of angst and 2 new
stomach ulcers at $45. 

You can get an external enclosure for about $30; make sure it has usb 2.0,
etc, etc. Check reviews because some enclosures really suck (I've had some
issues with transfer speeds, some have heat issues too, get one with a fan)

120Gb is about 30 DVDs, more if you use raid and you have a pretty good
chance of not having any of that data go bad, not that bad of a deal. It
should take you a while to fill. 

On a side note, I have a rack mount (4u) 7 bay scsi array w/ hotswap that
supports full size SCSI drives for sale with the 32mb smart array PCI or
EISA controllers.
Right now, It is filled with 7 4.? GB drives (but the drives can be upgraded
and I have a bunch of spare blades) and the whole bundle can be had for $200
OBO ;)

Hi all,

I acquired a netwinder linux appliance this morning,
and I am trying to log in, however, I didnt recieve
any login information with it.  Anybody know how I can
reload it?  I havent got any source disks, or boot
method other than the HD.  it is a Netwinder 2100 with
a 10 gig hd, and the entire appliance is very small at
about 6x10x2 inches with no drives other than internal
HD. 

any help and suggestions would be appreciated. 

John

I've never seen one of these up close, so maybe there is a better way,
but if you can pop the box open and remove the disk, you could plug it
into another linux box (as an "auxilliary" drive), mount it and change
the password, then plug it back into your netwinder (or appropriate
mutations of that approach).

Russel, 

Not a bad idea at all, but it uses a laptop HD. 
Unfortunately, I dont have the equipment to connect it
to anything. Pictures of it can be seen here:
http://www.rockhounding.net/docs/netwinder/

It has some limited technical info on it, and I was
able to find some information about loading an image
from a network, but I dont have enough equipment, a
network, or any such items available any more to make
this happen.  

I am willing to travel to any pdx location for
assistance with this device, if anybody thinks they
can help.  

Let me know of any options you may have?

thanks,

John

Unfortunately, I have been in the "laid off" category
since january, and times are tight....

Do you have one I could use for this project? 

PS.  I should mention Im still at novice skill level

I don't have one at all (although I wouldn't mind having one for the
toolkit).  Maybe someone else here does.

BTW, does anyone know where you can get one of these locally?

FWIW-The community driven site for these is the

some issue with their isp, most of the site is
inaccessible, and is being hosted on a mirror
currently with only the basic materials available...

I'm working on trying to log in on the recovery
partition, and make changes to the appropriate passwd
file, but being a noob, it is giving me some trouble. 
If anybody is available monday to meet up with me and
assist with this, could you please let me know?

You might try /usr/bin/enable to change the status (you'll need the full
path; there's also a shell function called 'enable').

  Who's in charge of mail lists for PLUG? While I've not posted anything to
plug-devel for months, the mailer daemon tells me that my machine has been
the source for an intolerable amount of spam so obviously I have an infected
machine and should do something about it.

  Well, considering that I don't do winduhs, haven't seen anything come in
via my subscription to plug-devel and run a tight mail server that denies
relays to all external domains, I know it ain't me, but a spoofed return
address. I want to communicate with someone who can tweak the drizzle box to
be a bit more conscious.

Thanks,

It is just a phishing trip to try to harvest more emails and/or 
spreading virii.  the ones i get usually have a suspicious attachment. 
It is not coming from th real plug server i would wager.

Michael,

  They do have the usual winduhs virus attachments, but the last hop to here
was from the PLUG mail server. Tracing back, one originated in India and the
other in western Europe. I would like those originating IP addresses to be
blocked at the PLUG server level.

  On a similar note, for the past week I've been getting spam messages from
Wil Cooley's domain. It ain't him -- most come from Phelps Dodge Corporation
in Phoenix -- but that's the putative return address.

  PITA, eh? I have an SPF record in my DNS file, but apparently not
everyone's using a MTA capable of querying it. (I know I'm not -- yet --
'cause postfix-2.0.x doesn't have the ability and I'm waiting to complete
the migration to my new box before upgrading to postfix-2.1.x.)

I'm signing clients up for the Postini preemptive email security service
<http://www.postini.com>.  

The Postini service filters all inbound email for spam, viruses, and
worms.  I'll be changing client MX record to point to a postini.com SMTP
server instead of my Sendmail SMTP server. 

I want to prevent black hats from bypassing the postini SMTP server and
sending SMTP traffic directly to my SMTP server.

How can I configure my SMTP server to only accept traffic from the
postini service using the /etc/mail/access file?  

Thanks ...John

I am outfitting a new computer and am thinking about

on hand. Lite-On's 8x is on sale at Circuit City, and
one of the reviewers was a Linux enthusiast. Is anyone
on this list enthusiastic about the DVD burner they

The purchaser is charged $120 at the store and
provided with $30 in rebates, from two different
sources. It will take a few minutes to complete the paperwork.

The Lite-Ons are supposed to be pretty good.  (The cd burner I have from 
them has worked well.)

I have a Pioneer DVD burner.  It is very quiet. (Almost too quiet.  It it 
was not for the light on the front, you would not know it was on.)  
Unfortunatly mine is only a 4x drive.  Speed is helpful when you need to 
make backups.

I have a Plextor external USB/Firewire DVD drive (PX-708UF) that works
very well.  I've had no coasters under Linux that were due to a hardware
problem.  I use it on multiple PCs and the only problem was on one Win2k
box when it was connected via Firewire the box would bluescreen.

http://www.plextor.com/english/products/708UF.html

(I've had a couple coasters because mkisofs silently skips files larger
than 2GB, but I'm working on a patch for this.)

The only problem with the Plextor is the price:

http://osdn.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php/masterid=1239366

$192 after rebate?*  Ouch!

However, if you plan to have it for a while, the legendary Plextor
reliability and standards compliance might be worth it.  (I still have my
original 4Plex CD-ROM in service...)  Plextor has been very good to me in
the past, so I keep paying extra to get quality hardware.  I've never had
problems writing CDs or DVDs that others couldn't read with this drive-- a
common problem I've had when using cheaper burners or cheaper readers.

Send it to plug-admin at pdxlinux.org (make sure the full headers are
included).  One of us will take a look at it.

Message-ID: <20040726174550.GA2790@gate.kl-ic.com>

I want to do something like:    ./myprogram | audioplayer  
or:                             ./myprogram > /dev/audioplayer

... where "audioplayer" is some program or device that absorbs
and buffers and plays sound data until it sees an EOF, and does
appropriate speed throttling, and "myprogram" is some hack of my
own that generates sound data in some simple uncompressed format.  
Assume, say, 44Ksamples/sec (or whatever), and that I have a fast
machine and program that can make those samples quickly enough.

While there are probably libraries that I can include in a program
to drive sound, I would like to use pipes and redirects (allowing
me to hack functionality in shell scripts, and fool around on the
command line).  No GUIs if possible.

What is the easiest way to do this?  Am I asking for the wrong
thing?  Can you suggest a website with examples?

If you're using alsa, I believe aplay will do this. At least it worked 
with this:   $ cat song.wav | aplay

I'm working on a serial driver for a telescope. How can I see the

I found 'ttysnopp', but it doesn't seem to be able to do what I want. 
'minicom' shows that the device is connected and functioning. What can I

The only cheap way I'm aware of is by using a program called ttywatch.  As 
as a deamon it attaches to the serial port and redirects output to syslog.  
You can also telnet to the tcp port, 3000 I think, to do interactive 
things, it's input/output is redirected to syslog.

Message-ID: <20040726203152.91812.qmail@web52404.mail.yahoo.com>

Let me start by saying sorry all, im destructively
noobish on linux, and I appear to have caused yet more
trouble.  I would do this on my main box and just
reimage it, but linux gives my fiance' a headache(she
is yet to be converted), and this way I might actually
learn something.  

My latest woes appear to have started when I did
something stupid.  I logged into a non privileged user
and typed startx, not knowing if it even had x
installed or configured.  It did some fancy stuff, and
then the screen went blank.  And never came back.  I
tried to get other terminals to come up, but no luck. 
It seemed to me to be not responding at all, so I
ended up doing a hard shutdown on the little thing and
now it just keeps rebooting with some file system
error.  I tried to use fsck on it but came up with
memory errors. I checked the partition tables with
fdisk from the recovery partition(hda4) and it stated
that the partitions overlapped...

Is there anybody who wouldnt mind donating some time
with me to fix some of the issues that might be
fixable, or to burn the latest copy of the images for
it? I can get hold of a backpack cd for it, or load
the images onto a windows host, and grab them via
network if needed.  If there is someone who can help
me out with this, please let me know.  I dont have
much to offer in way of payment, but I do have several
old isa nic's, bnc and 10base as well as a few pci
nics, and several small hubs that need power cords....

I have blank cd's to trade if someone kind would burn
the images for loading from cd and from a windows
server.  

Thanks in advance.

John

BFE? I don't think that's a TLA I learned at Intel.... What's a BFE?

Sorry if you don't like Fry's. I hear people bitch about them all the 
time, yet I've never had a bad experience and I go there all the time.
They're as close or closer to me here in Beavertron than pretty much 
anywhere else (a pretty sad statement in itself), and they have
any cable, connector, tool, adapter or component I could think of.

Fry's is good for tools and media.  Things that do not have parts that 
fail.

They do have a bad problem with putting back returned product to the 
shelves without addiquate testing.  (Which is why you never buy anything 
that has been already opened.)  I have also been told that a sufficient 
quanity of what they sell are referbs, not new, but i do not know for 
certain if that is true.

Theydo carry some very useful things, but you really need to know what you 
are doing to avoid return trips.

FWIW-Dual layer burners do exists, and there's even firmware hacks to
upgrade two models of single layer burns to dual layer. However, at
the moment the blank media costs almost as much as a new movie would.

The current 8x drives are supposed to be able to dual layer media.  
(Requires a more powerful laser than the older drives have.)  I have seen 
8x media available, but no dual layer media yet.

As for rw media, you just have to have an application that will allow you 
to erase the media. K3B will do it.  xcdroast with the proDVD add-in will 
as well.  (k3b is *much* better and does not require a closed source 
driver.)

You don't want an exact duplicate if the dvd was encrypted or region 
coded.  You will want to use something like transcode or dvd::copy to 
remove these impediments.

My apologies, I meant to add:

Otherwise you'll need a serial sniffer.  I've not seen one, but 
undoubtably BlackBox makes them.  It also may be that ttywatch may not 
work in the application as it controls the serial port when running.

I had this need last year and I believed someone on this

  run an audio cable from your sound card output
to your input.  Play 'myprogram" and then run
some audio capture software.

It worked for me.

The purchaser is charged $120 at the store and
provided with $30 in rebates, from two different

Dvdshrink for windows also works well for compressing those 9gb dvds onto a
4.5gb disk.
Can't beat it for simplicity afaik.

Is there a decent laptop out there that is UNDER $1100?

We're looking for decent battery life and integrated network (wireless
would be a special bonus).

It's not for me and will likely run Winders for some time, so this post is
off-topic, but not the type of off-topic that upsets anyone for whatever
reason.

Power isn't a HUGE issue because it's just going to be doing office stuff.
No serious number crunching.

So, what do y'all recommend?

There's a Dell Inspiron 1000 that is really cheap.  Knowledge and
experiences?

Thanks.

A Thinkpad. It won't be under $1k tho. 
A g4 ibook is a really good idea if you will have to support / drive out to
fix the damn thing when it is "broken".

Pretty much every support department out there is crap for laptops. Google
around for horror stories if you're bored. Toshiba is teh sux.

Sheesh.  Just because the machine is going to initially run Windows
doesn't mean I don't have an eye to the future of the device.  I don't
think I want to encourage the manufacture of a machine that isn't friendly
to the free software.

That's Dell's basic Windows laptop. Does fine with enough memory for the 
basic office suite. Screen's a bit small, though. I've had an Inspiron 
5000 for the last few years running W2K, and it's been great. Dell's 
warrantee is good (I've used it twice, and they honored it quickly and did 
the job effectively.) 

The guy next door to me's got a Dell Inspiron 1000 and likes it too. He
loaded Win2K on one drive and RH 8 on another, so he just changes drives
for whatever OS he wants. The machine's hard drive plug has gotten a bit
flaky over the last 3 years, but it's not designed for swapping drives as
a regular thing.

We've also got two sub-Kbuck Toshibas in the shop. But nobody wanted to 
run Windows on them so they've got RH 9 instead, and they've been perfect 
so far (but it's only been about a year.)

One thing regarding Windows... don't go light on the RAM, especially if 
your laptops are going to be sporting ExPee!

I think that should be true of any laptop at all... don't go light on
the RAM if you can avoid it, you'll just be shopping for RAM later on.

Although, price out aftermarket RAM before paying to have the
manufacturer put extra RAM in.

I have had good luck with my used Thinkpad which I bought directly from IBM

http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?storeId=1&catalogId=-840&langId=-1&categoryId=2576396

They are well under $1100, run Linux nicely and Windows as best they can.

Roger Creswick informed me that I can do a simple:

cat file.wav > /dev/dsp

... to output a file.  After a little fruitless fooling around, I
learned how to make a program do that, which I will discuss here.

The first thing to know is that /dev/dsp is unbuffered ;  the program
that feeds it has to push in a big enough chunk of bytes so that it
does not underrun the data fed to it.  There is a 44 byte header on
a .WAV file, and that, plus enough sound samples to last through a
few interrupts, must be shoved as one chunk into /dev/dsp .  I 
ended up writing a 4096B buffer, with the 44 bytes of header and 
4052 bytes of data, into /dev/dsp as the first chunk of data.  4KB
is probably way overkill, I'll let someone else figure out (on a
slow machine) what a more reasonable limit is.

The second thing to know, at least on my thinkpad T30 laptop, is you
can pick any sample rate you want as long as it is 16000 Hz.  The WAV
header has all sorts of control fields, but the sample-rate field did
not appear to affect anything.  I would prefer faster, because I want
to make some high frequencies, but the audio output filters appear to
eat everything above 5000 Hz.

The third thing to know is that the maximum length sound file you
can generate with a program is 18 hours, for single channel 16 bit
audio.  There are some length fields that limit the number of bytes
to 2^31, and thus the number of samples to 2^30, which at 16000 Hz
is 67K sec or 18.6 hours.  However, if you shove multiple sound files
in, one immediately after the other, they will play seamlessly.
I am designing an app that makes a continuous sound (which is why
making a WAV file on disk is not acceptable) but I can build the
continuous sound out of computed, stitched .WAV files.

That said, I got a cheezy program going.  While running, it consumes
less than a percent of resources (it doesn't even show in the first
45 lines of "top").  Which is good, because I will need that compute
power elsewhere.

---

BTW, what I am doing with this is making something called a "tinnitus
masker".  I have a permanent jet-engine-loud hiss in my left ear.  If
notice me talking too loud,  it is because I sometimes forget and try
to talk over it :-\ .  If I run loud white noise into that ear, it
causes the sound processing circuits in my brain to lower the amplitude
of everything from that ear - including the tinnitus - for some time
afterwards, which helps me get to sleep.  Right now, I am just making
random white noise, but I can run the random samples through a band
equalizer filter and "color" the noise.  Pipes make this a lot easier,
since I can add and subtract bands with lots of 5dB bandstop filters,
one feeding the other, until I have found the right shape .  Then I
can "freeze" the result in a single, simple filter.  

Now, if I could also build higher frequency hiss, I could make a demo
of what my own ear hiss sounds like.  Oh well...

I've got a Dell Inspiron 1100 w/a 2Ghz celeron which was under $1000. 
I'm not particularly satisfied with it - I use it only occasionally, and 
my general dissatisfaction does have something to do with it simply 
being a Windows box and being somewhat unfamiliar, but it's pretty much 
a giant heavy slow laptop with a crappy screen.  Battery life is 
actually pretty decent at 4+ hours.  I favor my ancient and 
slow-but-light with the dead battery laptop over the shiny new Dell on a 
daily basis.  That said I've never had a specific problem with it but 
that could be from disuse.  I'd still not recommend it.

If you don't actually need "Windows" but really just need MS Office you 
might consider an entry level iBook, they're "cheap" and good.  Be aware 
that if you need IE for some corporate IT web application you might 
actually need Windows because IE for OSX is vastly different than IE for 
Windows.

If you do create the demo, you could also try to run it out of phase,
maybe cancel out the hiss?

I appreciate all the comments from fellow PLUGers.  It may be fare to
say that when Vonage works, it works well, and when it doesn't, it's a
pain.

I've decided to wait until VOIP technology is a bit more cooked.

My employer provided me with the Dell Inspirion 1100, purchased refurb. 
It's just OK. No built in wireless, but it is "wireless ready" meaning 
that it has a PCMCIA slot. Being a bit older, it's a tad heavier than 
the current hardware. It's my windoze box, and I use it primarily for 
printing because there are no linux drivers for my Lexmark X5150. Having 
used other laptops provided by previous employers, I know there are 
better choices. I miss the thinkpad 600X I use to have. But, if I were 
choosing a new laptop today, I'd probably look real close at HP, or 
Sony. Primarily because I think of IBM as another evil empire monopoly 
in one sense. (But not as evil an M$ because of their open source 
support.) ;-)

You may be right about ttywatch. I got complaints about lockfiles and 
decided to go the hardware route. Turns out there already was serial 
sniffer lying around (just a mess of cables with four plugs). The only 
difficulty was finding a computer with two serial lines (I ended up 
using my desktop box).

Thanks for your help!

Message-ID: <20040727173149.GB10283@gate.kl-ic.com>

Jeme's target - a slower laptop that is Windoze (and hopefully later
Linux) compatable, for less than $1K - should be reachable.  The idea
of buying a used T2x series laptop from IBM is a good one.  However,
budget for (1) a warranty, (2) a padded carry bag, (3) more RAM,
(4) more AC adapters.  The latter three are best found aftermarket.

Other things to look for:  swappable CD/Floppy and USB.  2 PCMCIA
slots, 32 bit cardbus strongly suggested.  I like the little erasertip
trackpoint devices, others hate them. Trackpads appeal to some, I find
them far too easy to accidentally tap while using - older folks with a
tendency towards palsy/parkinsons can't use trackpads.  Try out the
various pointing devices on other folk's laptops - for at least an hour
each - before deciding.   My T30 has both, and I can switch between
them with the Xconfig.

Things may have changed, but I have had very bad experiences with Dell's
factory service, and others have had similar problems. I have seen Dell
take 4 months to perform a repair, while IBM takes less than 24 hours. 
Laptops are a lot of components in a poorly ventilated case, with a lot
more stress than a desktop usually gets.  The reliability suffers, and
you can expect about one service return per year for a laptop powered
up 24x7.  Warranty service is cheaper than pay-on-the-spot.

Note that the IBM 72W AC adapters (3.5(?)mm barrel, 16V 4.5A ) work
with earlier models as far back as the TP560, and probably into the
future.  I have adapters scattered all over, every place I linger
with the laptop - I hate crawling behind the sofa to unplug things.

When you finally go Linux, plan buying a hard drive carrier for the
swap bay.  When I am on a trip, I carry a spare identical hard drive
in the carrier, and at night I do a "dd" from hda to hdc, which copies
a 40GB drive in about an hour.  But as you know, I am obsessive about
backups...

Or you could try it for a month with their $14.99 package and if it

There are some setup fees, some of which may be refundable.  I think I was

Subject: [PLUG] Development tool to trace function calls
Message-ID: <14025-88664@sneakemail.com>

Folks:

Anyone who's had to debug some nasty OS/application problem knows how
useful "strace" can be for showing just what failed and how.  It's also
helpful to use gdb to catch a backtrace of the function calls after a
failure.

Does anyone know of a utility that will show a continuous log of function
calls as a program is running?  I've seen profilers that will show the
total number of times and time spent in a particular function, but nothing
that keeps a real-time trace of just what is being called.

For example, below is a sample of what I'd like to see for the following
pseudo-C-code:

-----
function increment(arg) {
  arg++;
}

main() {
  int val = 1;
  for (i=1 ; i<3 ; i++) {
    increment(val);
  }
}
-----

This mythical utility that I'm looking for would output:

-----
main()
increment(1)
increment(2)
increment(3)
-----

I suspect it would be dependent on proper debugging code or even profiling
code being present.

Is there something like this out there?  Some mode of GDB I'm not familiar
with?

Thanks,

In essence, you want something that attaches to a process and then works
like GDB doing a 'step' through every function call?  Yeah, I've wished
for that too...  I've suspected it might be possible to script GDB in
something like 'while(true) step', but never quite knew enough about GDB
to do it.  If you find something, please share!

Yep, almost what I'm looking for.  ;-)

Now if it just did function calls in addition to library calls...

It seems like gdb or gprof should do what I want, but I sure can't seem to
figure out how.

Chris:

Thanks for inspiring me to try a few more google searches.  After many
misses, a search on "gcc execution trace" hit some paydirt:

I won't be able to actually try this on a real program for a few hours but

OK, so I've got this idea and I don't want to start from scratch.

I want a website with three integrated things:  A wiki, a blog, and a
calendar.

In my mind, the blog portion would just have a series of articles posted
sequentially with datestamps and user comments.

The wiki would be a wiki like most others.

The calendar would just show when things are happening and have links to
the things.

Here's the catch:

I want to use wikiwords in my blog and have them link to the wiki.  I want
to use some kind of calendar words in my wiki and my blog and have them
create events in my calendar.

So if I type "Hey, I'm going to OaksParkRollerRink on 200407231830.", I'd
like a link to my wiki page on OaksParkRollerRink and a link to my
calendar entry for 6:30pm on 23 July, 2004 (where maybe even a link exists
to OaksParkRollerRink... but that's wishful thinking).

Has anybody ever heard of such a thing?

J.

  Looks a lot like Groklaw. That's based on GeekLog

  More that I should have added to the original:

"Geeklog is a 'blog', otherwise known as a Weblog. It allows you to create
your own virtual community area, complete with user administration, story
posting, messaging, comments, polls, calendar, weblinks, and more! It can
run on many different operating systems, and uses PHP4 and MySQL."

While we're at it, if you haven't heard of it, look into valgrind. I

Not explicitly, I don't know why since it's a good idea.

If you don't mind your blog actually being a wiki you can massage one of
the wikis that have a calendar plugin into doing that.

Or massage a pluginable weblog tool to link into a wiki w/calendaring if
you prefer a more "structured" blog.  One combination that does that
might be  Wordpress with WP-Wikify[1] and a wiki you like.  Linking back
to the blog from the wiki in some automagic CamelCase way would be cool
too - in a wiki like PmWiki that would be an easy feature to add, it
might be in your favorite one too.

You might take a look at Kwiki (e.g. ingy.kwiki.org).  Brian Ingerson,
recently of Portland, wrote it.  I guess he is in Seattle now.  It
combines at least the wiki with a blog.  I don't know about the
calender.

TikiWiki might work.  It has all three.

I use it myself, and know that WikiWords work in the blog.  I don't use
the calandering, so you'll have to experiment with it.

Open Source CMS has a demo of TikiWiki setup:
http://www.opensourcecms.com/

There is also the project page:
http://tikiwiki.org/

It has TONS of features, most of which can be disabled if you don't need
them.

both this ancient machine and whatever I buy down the road.

The two major choices seem to be USB and PCMCIA. I have the following
concerns:

1) Bandwidth

My current PCMCIA ethernet adapter is limited to ~1MByte/s, apparently
by the CPU speed and the processing involved in the PCMCIA bus. USB 1.1
has a theoretical limit of 12Mbit/s (1.5MB/s), but USB 2.0 is a good
deal faster. http://pcmcia.org says the PCMCIA bus is limited to 10MB/s
at the absolute slowest. How do USB and PCMCIA wireless cards perform in
actual use?

2) Convenience

The USB device seems inconvenient because it is a separate device. Is
this a problem for anyone?

3) Signal

Derek Loree mentioned a few weeks ago that the USB adapter has the
advantage that it can be moved around to find the best signal. How
useful is this in practice? How does the signal strength and reach of
the PCMCIA cards compare?

Thank you for any information or opinions,

Evan

Well, your ethernet card *should* be working at full speed.  In theory,
a PCMCIA 802.11G card could work faster than USB, but I'd be surprised
if there was a noticable difference with real-world signals.

I use my USB WiFi adaptor on my desktop, so I can't comment.  But a
PCMCIA WiFi card still sticks out a bit.  If you expect to use WiFi
quite a lot, esp. at cafes, go PCMCIA 'cos the USB dongle has to be
plugged in after you get the laptop out, while a PCMCIA can be left in
all the time if you're careful.

Works great for me in a permanent installation.  On a laptop in a cafe
or whatever, it's just a giant unnecessary hassle that makes you look
like a dork. :)

I recently picked up an Orinoco Gold off eBay for real cheap, like $11
w/shipping.  Orinocos are old and have really good driver support.
OTOH, Office Despot has a USB WiFi dongle for $20.  But then you get to
install the wlan-ng drivers or whatever.

I have upgraded multiple machines from RH 7.2 to 7.3 with apt.  It 
worked quite smoothly; there aren't too many major differences between 
those versions.  I have heard of people doing that upgrade with yum.

I would suggest using apt, mainly because RH 7.x use an older version of 
yum (1.0.x instead of 2.0.x with RH9 and later) that doesn't work as 
well.  The apt package from freshrpms.net works well.

Duh.  And also look at Mike Rasmussen's site:

That's got a calendar thingy on it and he uses it as a blog.

Yeah, but we probably look like a dorks with our laptops in cafes
running Linux in the first place, no?  :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Fax and answering machine problems...
Message-ID: <41079695.90005@robinson-west.com>

First of all, faxing really stinks.  You're making a phone call which 
isn't in many cases free.  It blocks your phone.  I have DSL and want
to trick an HP fax printer into dialing my Internet gateway server
on a simulated phone line.  Why?  So that I can turn faxes into
emails.  If there is a similar trick done on the recipient end,
the fax turned email should revert back to a fax.

The answering macine part is that I have one I really don't
like, a Uniden model with no programming instructions.  I have
a 56k internal Conexant fax modem that Linux seems to support.
I figure I can roll my own answering machine.

There's the problem of having to turn the answering machine
off for faxing.  I guess I can implement an off button on the
local web page.  Does anyone have good pointers for mgetty-voice
and if I can do audio emails
( the audio being the phone message attached as an ogg file. )
with postfix?

The cheapest phone line in Scappoose is $13/month.  Toll lines
are not allowed supposedly.  Even with a toll line, I could say
please call me back at this other number.  The good news is
that the DSL is being upgraded from a maximum speed of 768k
to 1.5 Megabits service.  Fiber optic cable is being used
to replace the copper cable going to the exchange box
located at the Callahan/Old Portland road intersection.

Is it really taxes imposed by the PUD, or is CenturyTel just
expensive in Scappose?

FWIW,

Given that a PCMCIA WIFI card isn't very expensive these days I wouldn't 
worry about moving it to your new laptop if you plan to upgrade. I went 
a year with a PCMCIA WIFI card and while it worked well it was a pain as 
it stuck out of the my laptop.  My new laptop has a mini-PCI WIFI card 
so it's inside with nothing hanging out. I like not having to remove the 
PCMCIA card before I put my laptop into my carrying case. We have a 
number of Dell and IBM laptops in our office and they all have the WIFI 
cards inside and no one has an external PCMCIA WIFI card expect one 
summer intern we have  using an old Dell 5000e laptop.

Evan,

  We have a Lucent/Orinoco Gold pcmcia card in the 600E here. We don't do
massive file transfers over the air, just e-mail, Web browsing and the
occasional printing from OO.o. It works fine from approximately 35 feet
distance -- through wooden walls in the house -- to the Linksys WAP54G
access point.

  This is, of course, a small subset of your concerns, but it is our recent
experience with this laptop. (Still haven't gotten sound to work, but that's
a very low priority after all my work- and book-related deadlines.)

  A newer portable will undoubtably either include WiFi built in or use a
cardbus adapter rather than a pcmcia adapter. Either way you may find it
advantageous to get the 600E functioning with the Lucent/Orinoco Gold and
determine the appropriate path for your new machine when you get it.

Both of these are faster than my broadband connection, which is the real
limit I am concerned with overcoming.  You might want to figure out
which version of USB your laptop has.

It is very convenient for my uses.  I have clients with servers that
where set up to auto-magically configure a USB wireless device, that way
I can run in, plug in the wireless device, then run out to my laptop in
my truck and not bother the client any more or not use any of their
workstations while I login to the server.

All of the USB devices that I have seen do not have removable
(replaceable) antennae, and they are all somewhat laking in power.  So
the big question is, how are you going to be using your wireless
device?  Is it mostly so you can roam around the house with your laptop,
do you want to go WAR driving, or do you want to be able to go to coffee
shops and utilize the connection there?

Big note, just like PCMCIA devices, the chipsets of USB devices are not
advertised and can change within the same model, some chipsets are
supported by linux and some are not.

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

if there is something in OpenBSD equivalent to /proc in Linux, where I
can check server info such as CPU, memory, IRQ's, etc.

Scott,

  Haven't installed OpenBSD, but I'm curious what directories are in /.

Thanks, the link you found answered my question. Here's what worked for
me:

  mkdir /proc
  mount_procfs -o linux /proc /proc

The "-o linux" option sets it up Linux-style.

Subject: [PLUG] Solaris question about packages
Message-ID: <41081061.5070404@dimstar.net>

How do I find out what package a particular binary came from on a 
Solaris machine?

I know that it was installed from a solaris package, I just want to know 
which one.

Specifically, I want to know what package the files in /usr/ucb 
(University of California at Berkley) came from.

Thanks!

Russ

Scott,

  What about mount_kern? Does that provide more info?

I think that most /usr/ucb/files are installed via the SUNWscpu 
package.

Sadly, I don't think the Solaris package manager provides a nice 
equivalent of "rpm -qf filename" (though I'd love to know that I'm 
wrong on that score). If you want to double-check my SUNWscpu 
guess, try this instead:

   grep /usr/ucb/cc /var/sadm/install/contents

Or, more completely

   for f in /usr/ucb/*; do
     grep $f /var/sadm/install/contents
   done

Well, since I posted that, I was pointed to this page: 

http://www.sundot.com/unix/solaris/handysol.shtml

Which contains the incantation: pkgchk -lp /usr/bin/ls

Which will reveal the package of the file /usr/bin/ls.

You are correct. The files I want to know about are from the SUNWscpu 
package.

Thanks for your help!

  Interesting! Thanks, Scott.

  I've read so many good things about OpenBSD that I may put it on my old
notebook just for giggles.

  Do you -- or anyone else here -- know where there might be information on
the office productivity applications that run on it? I know it's dandy for
firewalls, but I've seen only FreeBSD ports of apps, not OpenBSD. I've no
idea of the differences among the various *BSDs.

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

There's a extensive collection of ports and packages available online 
for OpenBSD. The pre-compiled packages are easily installed using the 
"pkg_add" command. If you're curious as to what packages exist for 
OpenBSD checkout the following link:

http://www.openbsd.org/ports.html

The OpenBSD CD set includes some of the more common packages but the 
full collection is available online. The only thing about OpenBSD is 
that is doesn't have a flashy GUI-based installer.  Everything is 
text-based and you have to hand configure files using a text editor. 
Once you've got the basic system installed the "afterboot(8)" man page 
gives you a lot of good information in terms of the system configuration:

http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=afterboot&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=OpenBSD+Current&arch=i386&format=html

I've never understood Linux's man pages as many seem out of date as the 
standard seems to be to us info rather than man pages in the Linux 
distirbutions I've looked at over the years. With OpenBSD they do a very 
good job of maintaining their man pages with each release. Looks like we 
may have another convert in to midst but I only use OpenBSD in a non-GUI 
mode for a dual or triple homed firewall. It's firewalling abilities are 
superior to Linux's "iptables" and the rule syntax is much more natural 
IMHO.

For my OpenBSD systems I keep the configuration files in a CVS server 
and then pull them out once I have network connectivity. It allows me to 
install and configure a working system very quickly. Since I use OpenBSD 
as my home's firewall I keep two older systems around with dual NICs. It 
allows me to install the newest release of OpenBSD on a system and then 
I can swap out my running firewall box with the newest version of 
OpenBSD. My home network is a critical infastructure for me so I have to 
make sure the firewall and internet gateway are working or I run the 
risk of getting in trouble with my better half.

I too have been thinking of trying OpenBSD on an unused 15G partition
on my main desktop machine.  Does anybody know if it plays well with
other OSes on-disk as Linux does?  In this case it'd be with Debian
"testing" and Windoze 2K.  Bootloader is grub.

Message-ID: <1404.216.99.218.67.1091120868.squirrel@216.99.218.67>

Good Morning all.

Well, last night I was doing some checking of my system and notice one
partition on one drive was not up on the raid.  Okay.  It is still
running as it is Raid 5.  So, I remove it and add it back into the
raid and it starts to sync back up.  Then I start the mdadm with
monitor.  This was running before but stopped when I rebooted I'm
sure.

So, Then I get all these emails that all partitions that that
Drive(Drive G) was using all stopped.  Hmm.  I decided to check out
the partitions and reformat or see where the problem lies.  Well, fsck
or fdisk can not see the partition.  Report it as zero bits on fsck
and fdisk says it can't be read.

Now, I need to either repair it somehow or replace it.  Shouldn't I be
able to see the partition in fdisk and fsck even if the partition is
not active in the raid?  Any suggestions to where the problem may be? 
I'm about to go buy another 120GB HD and put one in but would like any
suggestions as to trouble shooting steps that maybe I should be able
to do.

Thanks,

Josh

Do you have any info on the chipsets used by the board?

A Linux graphics driver is available from their Web
site. I suppose that means using an "expert" install
and copying it from removable media. I downloaded it
under Win XP and am going to look at the docs that go
with it.

I am downloading Knoppix 3.4 right now. When it is
done, it should enable me to see if this distro at
least has solved all the hardware problems. (Even with
3.3, the graphics were displayed correctly.)

Subject: [PLUG] Timex tmx2 mp3/watch/USB File Store not working under Linux (long)
Message-ID: <1091156776.7392.58.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I just bought a Timex tmx2 mp3/watch/USB File Store

Linux 2.2.26 (self built) does not seem to see it right.  It would on
the same laptop under win xp as a normal usb file device.  My old USB
dongle worked, as did others.  Base system is Fedora Core1 with recent

It shows up in the dmesq and messages, but fdisk is freaked out, it sees
4 whacked partitions...

I am going to rebuild with more USB debugging, but by all rights windows just saw a standard file store, with a fat partition.

Attempts to mount -v vfat did not work.

I took this to mean that PCMCIA cards have higher power (and therefore
longer range). Based on the good numbers here:

http://prism54.org/supported_cards.php

I'm looking at this card:

http://tinyurl.com/5uv3b [amazon.com]

It's the "3COM Corp OFFICECONNECT WIRELESS 802.11G ( 3CRWE154G72 )". Is
this card known to change chipsets on the sly, or is it a good choice?

Thanks to all of you!

Yes, Adam and I use the same stuff.  It doesn't do one of Jeme's
requests:

    I want to use some kind of calendar words in my wiki and my blog
    and have them create events in my calendar.

Which it doesn't do.  One makes calendar entries by clicking on the 
date in the calendar.  

I was going to suggest TikiWiki because it strives to integrate 
everything.  The PmWiki suggestion might pan out too.

Another approach would be to build a module (Got Python?) of Moin
Moin which would function like a named hyperlink

   CalendarEntry(YYYYMMDD,Title,Text of entry)

Which would:

   Create a wiki calendar page in the form CalYYYYMMDD populated with Text of entry
   display title

then add 

   CalendarDisplay(YYYY,MM) (parameters optional, default to current month

that would show the caledar.

One thing I do not like about the blogging portion of MoinMoin is that the page
names are in the form  CalendarName_2fYYYY_2dMM_2dDD.  I'd rather title my pages
and have the date information pulled from another source.  

The blogification, or date ordered display, of writings should, IMNSHO, be an 
optional display of the web sites pages.  It should be just as easy to pull
up an listing of pages ordered by some other criteria.  Or to display pages 
on a subject of interest.  A time stream of expression seems too confined.
Another option might be Blosxom with the Wiki add in.

Subject: [PLUG] Rolling my own answering machine...
Message-ID: <1091165761.16674.21.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I don't know if recording a greeting is necessary unless that's
how vgetty answers the phone.  I would think it could wait three
rings and answer without a message recording whatever I say
just to see if it works.

Anyways, I'm attaching the log from trying to call the modem
along with the LinuxAnt driver's output about the modem.

I called a dial up isp in minicom with the modem, it appears to be
working okay.



A site I've looked at makes this appear to be a lot easier to do 
than it really is:

http://linuxindia.virtualave.net/lamhowto.html



Is there something other than mgetty-voice to do this with that's
easier to work with?  I don't want to answer faxes, there's a fax
machine for that.  At the moment, I'd prefer to disallow dialin 
too.

Subject: [PLUG] parallel scheduling
Message-ID: <86llh25a02.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I am working on an "embarrassingly" parallel processing problem.  I
want a process to iterate exactly N times total on M processors all of
which run at different speeds (pardon the ASCII mathematical
notation):

  __ M
  \  N = N
  /_  i
    i=1

where N_i is the contribution of the i-th of M processors, and am
looking for a way to manage to stop exactly at N.  Is there a
canonical way to manage this?

My initial thought was that I'd have the slaves report back progress
N_i at regular intervals as they go and the master process will tell
them to stop and report results at some point.  But when things are
getting close to N, _who_ does the master tell to stop _when_ so as to
gracefully stop at exactly N.

Now, it happens that if I was to go over N, it wouldn't hurt anything
computationally (in fact it will improve accuracy of the resulting
computation to have more iterations), but it offends my aesthetic
sensibilities to not be able to stop at the correct N.  

I assume someone smart has solved this kind of problem already.  A
nice simple algorithm would be best.  Any ideas or pointers?

Some of them even have a port for an external antenna.  There are also a
large number of low powered PCMCIA cards out there.

I was sent some ideas by email, none of which directly answered the
problem, however, stimulated by them I thought of a solution that
ought to work.

Firstly, I don't want to constantly feed results back to the master,
because they are somewhat voluminous and because of the collation work
that would be involved, which leaves out just chunking results back
and throwing away the ones that arrive late.  I'd rather just feed
back progress information which is short (basically an integer) and
only provide full results at the end.

Here's the idea.  The master provides each slave an upper limit
stopping point where the slave will pause to await further
instructions.  Every so many iterations (at an interval substantially
smaller than the upper limit) the slave reports progress and also
checks on stopping point updates (which might go down or up).  The
master uses average progress to adjust per-slave stopping points.
Because the slaves won't go past the upper limits without permission,
I can guarantee I won't get too many overall.  Because future slave
performance is estimated from current results, I get reasonably good
load balancing (with close-to-minimal running time) with a fairly
simple algorithm.  This is also vaguely TCP-ish.

Any more thoughts?

Well, it wasn't so much a requirement as a cool sounding feature.

If the system could blog and wiki (and wikiwords in the blog linked to the
wiki portion and backlinks in the wikiword included the blog entry), then
it does nearly everything I want.

At that point, assuming the bliki (Ward's name for such a creature) is
modular, integrating with almost any web calendar seems not too too tough.

In fact, it's a little tempting to take existing perl blog, wiki, and
calendar modules and plug it all together.  The only thing that doesn't
appear trivial is making the backlinks work into the blogspace and adding
some kind of date-time parser into the wikiword link generator to link to
the calendar.

I'm still perusing the options.  Of course, I kind of want to stick to
perl because I know it best, but I don't know it so well that I would do a
much better job than some other language that I just started to learn.

I kind of want to put my foot down at PHP.  I think that shit's just bad
news.

Good ideas, sure.  Defaulting to the current month would be neat.  If you
could do natural language date parsing, that would be SUPER cool... so you
could just use terms like "next Wednesday" and it would get linked as a
wikiword, but the generation of the link would be done at blog entry time,
so it would know exactly which date is referenced.

That would certainly be out of my ability if I wasn't already vaguely
aware that it's been done and therefore probably exists as a module
somewhere (at least the parser).

Ah, see, I think that's exactly the right way to do it.  If you want an
IDEA that you can link to and modify as time progresses, it should be a
wiki page, not a blog entry.  The blog entries are to capture a state of
mind as much as an idea.  So the wikiwords in the blog entries are there
to link to the larger ideas and give you a space to develop those ideas,
but the blog entry itself shouldn't really be editable after the fact.
Certainly not like a wiki page, anyway.

Some people DO handle things this way, but all they're REALLY doing is
creating a new wiki page for some subject heading in their blog and the
blog page is nothing more than a "recent changes" page in their wiki.

I think this is a poor idea for the reasons stated above.  A wiki and a
blog serve two totally different purposes, but references between them can
be very informative.

I have an HSF type modem that LinuxAnt drivers support, but their HSF
drivers don't include voice support.

The referenced modem has class 1, but not class 2 fax.  If I can ignore
fax calls without turning my answering machine off, I'm happy.  I might
be able to use efax.com in order to avoid causing long distance charges
for people faxing me.  Without a telephone line simulator and a good set
of modems, I don't see how I'm going to transparently fool faxes I want
to send out into going out over a DSL line.  My thought is a special
email setup transforming outgoing faxes into outgoing emails.  After
that, I either need an intermediary to translate the email back 
into a fax and send it locally to the intended recipient, or clients 
who are happy with email. 

Why is there such a shortage of high quality, Linux compatible,
voice/data/fax modems?  Am I looking in the wrong place?
Seems like someone should be producing them unless embedded
devices are taking over.

Why is it that some modems can't answer the phone?  That seems like the
simplest thing ever.

Evan,

  This is the one I have for my Sony PCG-V505BC. It's one of the two
recommended/sold by EmperorLinux (the other being the Orinoco Gold) and --
after a _lot_ of work by the techs there (and Kurt, here) it's working like
a charm. Uses the Prism54 driver (aka prism2) and the latest firmware.agent.

I've never seen an external modem that would allow one to record the
incomng voice.  That RS-232 serial link just doesn't cut it.

I'd suggest finding a software package that seems to do the answering
machine portions well, and get a modem that the authors or other users of
the software recommend.

Probably true.  I was just trying to point the way to a hardware modem 
instead of a winmodem.

I found out about an Italian product that's Linux based which is a phone
and answering machine plus voice mail unit combined.  Don't remember the
URL though.  Boy, I have a couple of real modems like a zoom 2400 baud
external, never used, but it looks like none of them can do voice.

One thing I've run into is 56k internals that can't do voice trying
to send fax tnoes or something after three rings.  Can I disable
fax negotiation in the mgetty+sendfax or mgetty-voice package? My
only goal with faxes is to leave them for the fax machine, if that's
possible.  There's gotta be a way to disable fax and data negotiation.
If the modem doesn't have voice capability.  I should just get the 
weird can't answer the phone message and no fax or data should happen
after on my end.  Who would have thought that getting a modem working
in Linux doesn't mean you can simply answer phone calls.  I just hate 
this Uniden answering machine there's no instructions for that likes
to answer on the second ring.  Drives me nuts!

While I've never used it, my MultiTech MT5634MSV modem claims to have
voice recording capability.  The data rate for voice wouldn't
necessarily overtax a serial line.

  8 bits/sample(Alaw or ulaw) * 8 ksamples/s = 64 kbits/s

64kbps is possible at 115kbaud.  If the modem does any sort of
compression, you get even more headroom.

Here's a list of voice modems I found with a Google search.  I have no
idea how many of these are still available.

It's another Intel internal hardware modem pci based.  I don't know how
to find out if this works in Linux as far as voice is concerned.

I'm watching a guy's Intel hardware modem listing on Ebay who claims his
modem works in Linux and that it can do voice.  I'd almost want to buy
it from just to support what he's doing advertising Linux even if he's
wrong. 

There are these Diamond USB modems which apparently have voice and
something called call hold, though a lot of them suggest you 
have to have call waiting service.  I know it sounds lame, but 
perhaps a USB modem is more likely to have voice support than a 
PCI one.  Trouble is, do any voice capable USB modems work fully 
with Linux?  It has to be USB1 spec.

I've got to wonder... how did the BSA even get in the front door?  If I
were running a business and somebody came up and said "we want to do a
software audit of your business" I'd tell them to go jump in the ocean.

The SSLPassPhraseDialog runtime directive is helpful in this regard:

My guess is that a disgruntled former employee or contractor tipped 
off the BSA.

  I don't know the details, nor how they work. IIRC, disgruntled employees
turn in employers quite frequently.

  There is a manufacturer -- I believe of knives -- in California who took
your approach and defenstrated very quickly. He's been a keynote speaker at
several linux conferences.

  If I was in the computer business I'd assemble a team to do hardware,
systems software and applications programming. Then I'd contact every
business in a 50-mile radius with a presentation on the BSA, how businesses
have reacted and an offer to prepare a proposal to move them to FOSS.

If you're gonna do that, though, you might as well remove the passphrase
on the key.

Here's BSA's take on the raid...

http://tinyurl.com/4a5gd

Ernie Ball (guitar strings) decided to go Open Source after they got
hit. All it takes is one disgruntled (ex)?employee for the BSA to get
the requisite search warrant. Their powers are scary:

That is what I was thinking.  Whare really are the security risks behind 
that the documentation refers to?

Garl,

  Thank you. That's what I didn't remember. Guitar strings/knives, not much
difference if you don't have caluses on your finger tips. :-)

  And the Ernie Ball story added to the fine Harry's paid makes powerful

If someone is able to swipe your private key (and get DNS sufficiently 
jimmied) then s/he can get a system to masquerade as your secure host. 
A passphrase on your key makes it that much more difficult for the 
thief to use.

Of course, if someone swipes your key, s/he has probably already 
rooted your box -- unless you're doing something silly like sending 
your key somewhere via e-mail or keeping it in an unprotected 
directory.

Thanks ;-)  The guy I listed as a seller of a Linux compatible internal
pci voice modem is someone I'm giving a try.  The guys in California, 
so it should get to me shortly.  I want an internal since my
Intel D815EEA2 motherboard doesn't have a second serial port 
as far as I can tell.  I had an external which ran into cable problems,
they frayed over time.  External modems aren't as secure as internal
models either.  It's a hardware based Intel modem I'm getting, it 
might even work on my PC164 Alpha system.

Why didn't someone a long time ago integrate a 56k modem on a
pci based ne2000 clone?  Classic nic ports have been faster than
serial for a long time, they are more than fast enough to
support modem speeds.  Linux has solid ne2000 drivers.

Not only that, if he's captured your SSL-protected network traffic, he
could then decrypt it.  At least, I think so.  Having the passphrase to
the key on the server with the key only means the cracker has to find it
instead of swiping the key directly.

I'm sure none of us have *ever* done anything like that ;)

That's exactly how it happens in most cases. 

As for getting in the door: Megalosoft's EULA specifies their right to
audit software use at customer sites. So Harry's agreed to this when they
did the click-through dance.

How are external modems less secure than internal modems, exactly?

If the cable frayed, you were doing something wrong, I think.

And how, exactly, would you tell an ne2K to dial a phone number?  Or

Naw, they're two different kinds of hardware doing two different things.

It's not that hard to put an 8 bit computer on a hardware modem
and hook it to an ethernet port.  8 bit computers aren't 
expensive either.  It's the mainframe concept of multiple well 
designed computers intended for small tasks working together.
PIC micro controllers are cheap these days.  That's what makes
the MARS rovers possible.  Couldn't IBM XT's run ethernet?

The Video is Via Unichrome Graphics, which does not seem to have much
support. Knoppix is almost certainly using the VESA driver to do it.

The Sound is an ADI AD1980 chipset, which is an AC'97 codec chip, and
should therefore be minimally supported by that driver. ALSA, however,
claims to support the AD1980 chipset, so a 2.6 kernel should work with
this (in theory). My 2.4 kernel only has AD chipsets in the 18xx ranges,
so seems not to.

the LAN is a VIA VT6103 chipset, which should be the via-rhine driver
without too many problems.

Let me add to this that what you can do, if you want, is grab the file
/etc/X11/XF86Config-4 off the Knoppix boot, and place it in the same
place on any of the other installs, and you should get working video
(though it may have irritants around the edges), and you can modprobe
via-rhine and get working network on any of the others, and as for
sound, you're likely going to have to upgrade the kernel to 2.6 or use
the 2.6 boot on one of the newer distros, and should be able to get
sound with that.

You're talking about building a modem that plugs into an Ethernet port
then?

They have dial-up routers (although probably by a different name) that
are essentially modems that dial on demand, allowing the computer to
access the Internet through an existing network.

For back before they had DSL.  :-)

What's to stop an angry person from walking into a company with illegal
software just to get the company fined?  This attitude of the BSA is
extremely litigious, will they even sue over copyrighted software 
that's ancient?  Technically, if your computers are off when they 
come to audit you I don't think they can bust you.  I think fair 
use allows multiple copies of software as long as you don't use 
run more copies than the licenses you have simultaneously.

What's costing jobs is the liability of touching much of the
software and even hardware out there today.  Instead of becoming
a service industry based around open source and open standards
there's the Megalosoft culture.  Auditing a restaurant is just
disgusting.

Those click EULA's are so hard to read, just how binding are they
anyways?

Click-through EULAs have been enforced in the past.  For some examples,
see:

http://www.phillipsnizer.com/library/topics/click_wrap.cfm

There's also the question of whether the people who click the EULA can
speak "for the company" and extend the liability to the entire company.
If a corporate officer clicks the agreement, it's pretty cut-and-dried,
but how often is that the case?  ;-)

We were required to attend SAMI training where I work. It was hammered
home that both the company and the employee are liable.

Are there any caps on liability?  Why fine grandma $100k for 
potentially an honest mistake on her part?  I don't disagree 
with this SAMI training, but I must admit that the legal 
situation with EULA's is frightening. Imagine if SCO could 
get IP rights to Linux.  If I owned IP and someone didn't 
have a license, why couldn't I just force them to pay the 
normal price for one?  If enough people are honest enough 
for me to profit fairly, I don't see how some infringement 
on my IP via illegal copying makes any difference.  It 
concerns me that protections that can be tripped on so 
violently aren't phased out.

What has driven the courts to mete out egregious fines?  

In a practical sense, especially considering computers 
that have a network or cdrom boot feature that can't be 
disabled, how can software use and copying be 
controlled?  Specifically, HP latops come to 
mind.

Maybe the message from Microsoft is simply, don't use
our software.  If it costs a lot and there's $100k
liability, that's a good argument for OSS.

Is there a grass roots effort to encourage 
negative purchasing in order to curb the 
BSA's excessive enforcement policies?  
A way for the consumer to fight back 
against a pending liability crisis?
If these big software companies lose 
enough money, will they reconsider the
BSA's tactics?  Is it safe to join in
an outcry?

Well, they probably won't fine a company more than they can pay. After all,
if someone tells a company to pay them a million and you only have $250,000,
they probably are not going to see any of that money. 

> Why fine grandma $100k for potentially an honest mistake on her part?  

Because they can. Also, a ton of money collected by the BSA stays in the BSA
- i.e. this money isn't returned to the vendor(s). It is also easier to prey
on the weak if you get the right judge. I believe a bunch of guys in the 20s
and 30s followed a similar business plan.
People also sell what I like to call "protection racket" software. Basically
a simple database to track licenses, etc. 

> If I owned IP and someone didn't have a license, why couldn't I just force

Because the court fees are a bitch and probably not worth the time and
effort to collect $300 or even $5000. Anything above that and you get into
court where you have to pay lawyers. 

>If enough people are honest enough for me to profit fairly, I don't see how

BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS LOSING MONEY!! OH MY GOD THEY ARE KILLING US AND WILL
MAKE US FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY! DAMN THOSE TERRORIST PIRATES!!!

Just ignore logic and most of their strategies will make sense. For example,
a college student pirates Photoshop / autocad. If you ignore the fact that
the college student doesn't have enough money to buy Photoshop and couldn't
buy it even he wanted to (i.e. you couldn't possibly ever get a dime for the
product from the college student), you could consider that the college
student is stealing from you. 
If one has a brain capable of something called "thinking" however . . .

Have you bribed your congressman lately? No? Guess where a bunch of BSA
money goes. 

> What has driven the courts to mete out egregious fines?  

Congressmen need shiny new cars, drugs, hookers and people to hide bodies
for them. The BSA needs money to bribe aggressively. 
Everything costs money.

People are sheep and are about as intelligent. Whatever comes pre-installed

You can usually negotiate - i.e. in exchange for reducing the fine, we will
buy the whole MS big ass licensing package for the next 10 years that
includes a ton of stuff that we will never use. Again, you can't get blood
from a rock. You can attempt a long term settlement and drive your small
business into the ground.

Nope, they will blame any losses on piracy. By "they" I mean the group who
gives the numbers to the companies - the BSA. 
The BSA likes reporting big numbers.

> Is it safe to join in an outcry?

Depends if your licenses are up to date and everything is documented. A
bunch of schools went through audits and ended up having to pay even though
they had the licenses, they didn't have the right kind of documentation or
something equally inane. 
Why schools? Because, you know, student employees can be treated like shit
and don't have close to the same rights as regular employees. The BSA loves
disgruntled employees.

Awww...

Come on folks.. BSA isn't JUST Microsoft...

Try these companies:

Adobe, 
Apple, 
Autodesk, 
Avid, 
Bentley Systems, 
Borland, 
Cisco Systems, 
CNC Software/Mastercam, 
Entrust, 
HP, 
IBM, 
Intel, 
Internet Security Systems, 
Intuit, 
Macromedia, 
McAfee, Inc., 
Microsoft, 
RSA Security, 
SolidWorks, 
Sybase, 
Symantec, 
UGS Corporation,
VERITAS Software


If you don't like BSA... Why give overpriced $$$ to any of these companies?

> Are there any caps on liability?

Well, they probably won't fine a company more than they can pay. After all,
if someone tells a company to pay them a million and you only have $250,000,
they probably are not going to see any of that money. 

> Why fine grandma $100k for potentially an honest mistake on her part?

Because they can. Also, a ton of money collected by the BSA stays in the BSA
- i.e. this money isn't returned to the vendor(s). It is also easier to prey
on the weak if you get the right judge. I believe a bunch of guys in the 20s
and 30s followed a similar business plan. People also sell what I like to
call "protection racket" software. Basically a simple database to track
licenses, etc. 

> If I owned IP and someone didn't have a license, why couldn't I just 
> force them to pay the normal price for one?

Because the court fees are a bitch and probably not worth the time and
effort to collect $300 or even $5000. Anything above that and you get into
court where you have to pay lawyers. 

>If enough people are honest enough for me to profit fairly, I don't see

BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS LOSING MONEY!! OH MY GOD THEY ARE KILLING US AND WILL
MAKE US FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY! DAMN THOSE TERRORIST PIRATES!!!

Just ignore logic and most of their strategies will make sense. For example,
a college student pirates Photoshop / autocad. If you ignore the fact that
the college student doesn't have enough money to buy Photoshop and couldn't
buy it even he wanted to (i.e. you couldn't possibly ever get a dime for the
product from the college student), you could consider that the college
student is stealing from you. 
If one has a brain capable of something called "thinking" however . . .

Have you bribed your congressman lately? No? Guess where a bunch of BSA
money goes.

Congressmen need shiny new cars, drugs, hookers and people to hide bodies
for them. The BSA needs money to bribe aggressively. 
Everything costs money.

People are sheep and are about as intelligent. Whatever comes pre-installed

www.asteriskpbx.org

digium has a cheap modem that works great with asterisk and works as an
actual pbx.  Now it turns out that they used a standard winmodem, and
most winmodems/softmodems can do voice with the right commands.  You can
find el cheapo cards on ebay and the net that are the same card as the
XP100, but have a slightly different ID.  Minor modification of the
source will make it work.  But then you are not supporting digium, which
puts lots of resources into asterisk (GPL).  Oh yeah, you get support
with that cheap card from digium.  You probably want that.  They will
really help get you moving.  For $100 you get a lot of support
apparently.

You can "dumb" down asterisk to a pbx to an answering machine, or you
could just switch to VOIP, or have a hybrid:  The PBX can answer the
phone after X rings, and you can go outbound from a SIP phone in the
house to the PBX out the analog line.  Other wise you answer the phoen
normally.  Or you can SIP/VOIP out your broadband connection.  Fun for
testing!

I see the asterisk page now lists the clone, which is cool for honesty
and openness.

Subject: [PLUG] Printing Problems
Message-ID: <410cdb72.441681@mail.aracnet.com>

HI All,

Okay this is my problem. 
after installing SuSE 9.0 on my box, it fails to print. It won't allow
me to do any kind of printer administration because the box goes into
lock up if I try. I've clean installed twice and in both installs, it
sees the printer, prints a test page and finishes. Once I reboot, it
all goes to heck in a hand basket.

Now, I'm quite prepared to re-install yet again, but I'd really like
to believe it is going to work if I do. Otherwise, I'm tempted to keep
the Winder box to do printing from. 

Let me know what info and how to get it for you and I'll be glad to
post it for anyone to see if it will help me to learn how to fix this.

Thanks in advance,

Harry

Dear michael_robinsom,

"Does it work under Linux?"

Linux, : ), thats like saying does it work with electricity.  You got a
type of Linux you are talking about?  A distribution number?  But the
most probable answer is yes, because with all the forms of Linux I have
ever used I have never had a single modem not work, it is just a matter
of getting that funking OS to initialize the modem.  I would go on a
chat room and see if anyone has done it before.

Yup.  Carrot and stick.

Over at FreeGeek Collaborative Technologies, we're helping nonprofits go
open source.  It's really fun.  We don't need to use "Go opensource or
the BSA's gonna getcha!" with nonprofits (yet).  "Share and enjoy" is
more their style.

Wish I had time to jump in on a venture selling OSS conversions to SMBs.
Using the BSA's tactics against itself would be quite satisfying.

That, and there's always, "Who would you rather have locked-in to a big
greedy software vendor: you or your competition?"

Harry,

  Can you be more specific? What printing system are you using (lpr, lprng,
cups, something else)?

  What do you mean by "It won't allow me to do any kind of printer
administration because the box goes into lock up if I try."? Do you have
/etc/printcap? If you have cups installed, you should have
/etc/cups/printers.conf. Also with cups, are you using the bui to reach
<http://localhost:631>?

  If the installation process recognizes the printer and successfully sends
a test page, but this ability is lost upon a reboot, it means that the
printing system daemon is not being loaded during the boot process. I've no
idea how SuSE does things, but in Red Hat this would be
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S99cups (which points to /etc/rc.d/init.d/cups start); SuSE
has the equivalent.

I am also having a printing problem on SuSE 9.1. When I first installed
it a few weeks ago, I could print perfectly to an old Apple
Laserwriter, and to a newer Epson Stylus C80 inkjet. A few days later,
I could not print to either.

I'm using CUPS. The CUPS service is running, and can be stopped and
started again without problem with /etc/rc.d/cups (start|stop).

When I try to test a printer from Yast, I get the following error
message:

  An error occurred while communicating with the CUPS server
  while saving queue y2test.
  cups(File)DoRequest error: client-error-request-value-too-long

I click Ok, then get this error:

  Unable to print test page.
  Output from lpr:
  lpr: unable to print file: client-error-request-value-too-long

Numberous google searches on these error messages came up with several
other people with similar issues, but no working solution.

I have uninstalled CUPS, then reinstalled it, from Yast, but the
problem persists.

I run SuSE 9.0. I have  /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S14cups, (which I believe points 
to /etc/init.d/cups start). I also found S14cups in /etc/init.d/rc3.d.

Scott,

  I cannot offer a cogent solution. Based on what you've written I suspect
either the USB side or the SuSE side. Someone more clever than I will
respond with useful information.

Sorry,

Rich

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0407311520180.5902@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  This is quite frustrating. On my old Red Hat box I installed firefox-0.8.0
with no problems into /usr/local/firefox. I'm now trying to replace mozilla
with firefox-0.9.2 on my new Slackware box and I just cannot figure out the
magic combination.

  If I, as a user, try to install it in any directory (not /usr/local/ as I
don't have write access to that) it fails because it cannot find xpistub.so.
That library is present in both /usr/lib/mozilla-1.4/ and
/usr/local/mozilla. On the RH box it's located in /usr/local/mozilla/.

  I cannot install as root because: if I 'su' or 'su -', the installer
cannot open the already open X display and will not use the existing one or,
if I exit X and log in as root on a different terminal, Xfce comes up but
the mouse is stuck. Sigh.

  Don't remember how I replaced mozilla with firefox on the RH box, but it's
worked like a charm. Any and all suggestions on how I should proceed on the
new box are greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Rich

Try 'sux' or 'sux -'.

Mel,

  No such animal here as a stand-alone tool. Is this something non-standard?
It's a new one on me.

Gah.  No idea why logging into X as root breaks the mouse, and I don't
know how to properly fix it so root can access a regular user's X
session, but I cheat by logging in as e.g. 'aaron', opening an xterm,
su'ing to root, then doing a 'cp /home/aaron/.Xauthority /root'.
This works until I next log in.

Good luck,
  Aaron

It may be something SuSE specific. However there is nothing in the man 
or info pages on it. The command was posted on an Ximian newsgroup 
(IIRC) as a means to open the red-carpet GUI as a user.

What about just setting up sudo?

Would you run 'rpm -qf /usr/X11R6/bin/sux' and tell us the package
name?  My Fedora Core 2 system doesn't have it either.

I did a bit of a search through redhat's site, and Fedora's little
subdomain, and came up with nothing. So I'll just add the Debian way to
this.

 ( from http://fgouget.free.fr/sux/ )
 

Gotta give debian credit for a bunch of things, and one of those is
packages.debian.org which would give you this even if you didn't have a
debian system. 

And, amusingly enough, the "Project Home Page" for sux (linked off the
sourceforge site) is

packages.qa.debian.org/s/sux.html

FWIW, Gentoo (or any portage-enabled system):

Another trick that can work is to slogin to localhost as root, as in:

  $ slogin root at localhost 

If root is allowed to login via ssh, and X forwarding is enabled in
ssh, then this should work too.
