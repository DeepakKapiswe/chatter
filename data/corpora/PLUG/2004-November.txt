Hi:

I am looking into how to setup a MySQL cluster on a bunch of Linux boxes.
Does anyone have experience with MySQL cluster that he/she can share?

Thanks for any tip.

Message-ID: <40580.192.168.0.254.1099340541.squirrel@192.168.0.254>

It it possible to have too much swap space? For example, I've
got 256 Meg of Ram on a Fedora Core 2 box, and a full 1 Gig of
swap space configured. Is there any way I could be suffering
a performance *penalty* for having too much swap? (I've got
plenty of disk space, so I'm not worried about "wasting" a
little space.)

No; if you find the kernel swapping more than it should (instead of
reclaiming cache pages), there is tuning you can do via sysctl.

Saving to PNG and JPG formats allow you to specify a compression
factor.  You can also toggle an "interlaced" setting.  IIRC, the interlacing
effect feeds the browser a coarse image (every other line?) which it can
begin to paint, and then as the rest of the data is retrieved the image
begins to sharpen up.

Don,

   Thanks to all of you.

   I discovered that while the GIMP reports "1.2M background" the image file
size is only 23K. What the higher value represents I've no idea, but the
image does load quickly so it's a non-issue.

Rich: Gimp tells you how much memory the image consumes in uncompressed
format. That's just the number of pixel times color depth. 

Someone asked about the JPEG quality setting. For web images a setting
between 0.6~0.8 is good in most cases. I found a 800x600 pixel JPG image
with good size/quality compromise very often ends up around 80 kByte,
regardless of quality settings. 

Interlaced images are downloaded and rendered in several passes,
skipping lines until it is fully loaded. It is seen earlier in the
download process but the resulting image is also a bit larger.

By typical Debian naming, it'd be in libmath-matrix-perl.  But it
doesn't show up in apt-cache, so you'll have to get it from CPAN.
Nicest way I've found is to use dh-make-perl, which can pull the
module from CPAN and make it into a Debian package.

      This is not a technical presentation, because David hasn't
      had time to do much new technical work lately.  Instead he
      has been busy teaching Information Technology at Pioneer

Subject: [PLUG] News about the dirvish disk-to-disk backup program
Message-ID: <20041102052017.GA31032@gate.kl-ic.com>


Back in March 2004, I gave a presentation at the PLUG meeting about dirvish,
an rsync-based disk-to-disk backup program.  There have been quite a 
bit of news since then - if you don't care, hit "n".

There is a website and a wiki and a mailing list:
   http://www.dirvish.org/
   http://www.dirvish.org/wiki
   http://www.dirvish.org/mailman/listinfo/dirvish

Stop by and look.

The most important news is that the author of dirvish, Jonathan W.
Schultz, drowned in Lake Mead in March.  I found out about it in late May,
and I set up the sites above to maintain and develop the software.  More
needs to be done, and experienced perl hackers are welcome to contribute.

Other news is that I just set up a mailing list with Mailman and Postfix
and a virtual domain, and the experience was somewhat nasty (and perhaps
incorrectly done).  If anyone has experience with these, I could probably
use some list testing help.  The wiki was a lot easier to set up.

Finally, I am working with Hal Pomerantz, technical editor of Sys Admin
magazine, on a three part article for the magazine.  Hopefully the first
part will be in the January issue.  Anyone who wants to contribute to
testing the examples, or wants to contribute some embarassing questions
that articles 2 (setup) and 3 (restore) should answer, let me know.

 My Father's Vision

 By Gene Weingarten
 Tuesday, November 2, 2004; Page A21

 My father, Philip Weingarten, is 90. He wears hearing aids in both
 ears. At night, before he goes to bed, he removes them as he stands with
 his head above an open dresser drawer. That is because, if he dropped
 one on the floor, he could never find it. He cannot see the floor.

 His right eye sees nothing. The sight that remains in his left eye is so
 limited that, to read, he must use a machine that magnifies each letter
 to the size of a baseball. In this manner, he reads The Washington Post
 every day, all day. The retina in his functioning eye is a rubble of
 scar tissue, so ravaged from diabetic damage and macular degeneration
 that his doctor doesn't know how he sees anything at all. Somehow his
 brain has learned to cobble together into vaguely recognizable images
 the fractured signals from the few neurons that still fire.

 When he walks the halls of the assisted-living facility in which
 he lives, people greet him by name, but he cannot do the same in
 return. The friendly blobs are indistinguishable. I have always joked
 that my father is the reincarnation of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir
 to the Austro-Hungarian throne. That is because he was born on June 28,
 1914, the day the archduke and his pregnant wife were assassinated,
 touching off World War I. Ferdinand's dying words were selfless --
 concern for his wife and family -- which pretty much sums up the way
 my father has lived his life.

 Though his eyes have betrayed him, his mind remains as sharp as
 yours or mine. He was an accountant, and has attended to his own
 affairs ably until just last week, when he found he could no longer
 see well enough to write checks or keep records. And so my wife and I
 brought him to the bank, where he conferred power of attorney on his
 daughter-in-law. Intending no disrespect, the banker began by directing
 questions to my wife and me, but quickly checked herself when my father
 volunteered not only his Social Security number but the precise number
 of his savings account.

 He moves in a determined shuffle, behind an aluminum walker. When he
 ventures outside, he needs a companion to warn him of the presence
 of a curb, or a sidewalk anomaly. The ground is a soupy mist to him,
 swallowing his legs at the thigh. Daylight can play mischief with
 his eyesight. Sometimes, the empty streets before him are aswarm with
 pint-sized people, or blocked with poplar trees, or are a landscape
 of yawning craters. These are the only things he sees in sharp focus,
 because they bypass his ruined eyes entirely. They are inventions of
 his brain, a medical syndrome not uncommon in people with profound loss
 of vision. They are hallucinations, but not delusions. He knows they
 are unreal; still, it is an act of faith and no small courage to step
 confidently forward into an abyss, just because someone you love tells
 you it is safe.

 It is through this foggy soup and minefield of phantasms that my father
 will walk this afternoon, with me at his side, into a church in suburban
 Maryland. There -- as he has done every four years since he chose
 Roosevelt over Landon -- he will cast a mathematically insignificant
 vote for president of the United States. Because he knows it is the
 right thing to do.

 So, what are you doing today?

Subject: [PLUG] Anyone Using Scribus?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0411020814270.28535@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I tried using the latest Scribus (1.2) last evening, but failed at the
first attempt to put a graphic frame on the top of the page and insert a
masthead graphic there. Earlier in the year (with version 1.1.5) I found a
superficial tutorial someone had put together, but my system was too slow to
run the application efficiently. So far, I've not found any docs other than
some on-line but not downloadable for printing.

   Has anyone here got it all figured out? Can you use it productively to
produce a newsletter, for example? How do you suggest I start getting up to
speed with it?

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

I haven't really used Scribus much more than a proof of concept for 
myself. I just opened up my Scribus (v.1.2.1cvs), clicked the insert 
graphic tool, dragged the size box I wanted and then right clicked in 
the box and chose "Get Picture". I chose a jpg and it snapped right in.

My proof of concept was a mock newsletter and I found that there is a 
lot of appropriate actions when you right click on various objects.

Use the CPAN shell:

perl -MCPAN -e shell;

and then at the CPAN prompt:

install HTML::Mason

I must be missing something....

What's the difference between the non-XML-escaped one (top) and the XML-
escaped one (bottom)?

Keith,

   I thought that was about what I did, but apparently not. I'll try again
later today.

Did your mail client do something funny to those?  The ampersand in
the second one should be the character entity '&amp;' and in the first
it's just the character '&'.

Bzzzt!  Not on my boxes you don't!  It's all happily packaged and
installed now.  Well, /sans/ some Apache configuration... Anyone using
RHEL3 and clones can fetch perl-HTML-Mason, modperl-Apache and modperl-
Apache-modules with Yum:

[nakedape]
name=Naked Ape Packages for RHEL3- $basearch
baseurl=http://haus.nakedape.cc/ftp/nakedape/rhel3/

Subject: [PLUG] coping with the slashdot effect and a DOS attack
Message-ID: <20041102174556.GB17647@patch.com>

If you wade through the political content and read to the end
Andrew Tannenbaum[1] tells about his site being hit with a DOS
and being slashdotted on the same day.  Two of his colleagues
are studying how to cope with flash mobs and they got good data.

http://www.electoral-vote.com/

[1]  I'm curious about how many of you know who Andrew Tannenbaum 
is and if so when you first became aware of him.

Please reply off list.  

The reason for the curiosity is finding out that none of my coworkers
had heard of him.

I'm at the point of just punting when it comes to applications that 
require a gazillion unpackaged Perl modules. RT is a good (or bad, 
depending on your mood) example.

I built a local copy of perl in /usr/local/perl-<vers>/, use CPAN.pm 
to manage modules, and adjust the #! line accordingly in those complex 
applications.

The system perl stays pristine, and the local perl is easy to manage 
(no rpm building necessary).

In some ways it's a headache, but it makes RT management soooo much 
simpler.

I suspect I'd do the same thing if I had to maintain a heavily 
customized python environment...

I gave up on RT and found Roundup (http://roundup.sf.net), which sold me
immediately because of the demo mode.  Plus, I generally prefer Python
+ZPTs.

Hm, that's in interesting take on it.  It doesn't really deal with the
reproducability aspect (well, I guess you can just copy the directory to
a new computer).

There are two ways to deal with reproducability (is that really a 
word? :-):

1. Script the build (ala rpm) and then, using the newly built perl
    binary, do all the CPAN installations.

2. Build it by hand, then tar up the directory tree.

Either way make backup/restore/propogate relatively painless. If 
you're so inclined, you can even produce a nosrc rpm and push it 
around the network that way...

   However, one should always eschew obfuscation and stick with "make a

Mine did too. It's Evolution 1.4.6. Viewing "Email Source" shows the

Subject: [PLUG] FTP server and Samba mounted shares
Message-ID: <9e0a357804110309397ce09b97@mail.gmail.com>

I'm in the process of migrating a Windows FTP server to Linux.  The
FTP user's home directories are on a Windows file server, however, and
I'm running into permissions issues.  I've used smbmount to mount the
Windows file shares, but user's seem to only have the rights of the
Everyone group, which is very restricted.  I have a mount script that
runs the following for each user to mount their FTP home directory:

su - theuser -c "smbmount //server/share /ftp/theuser -o username=domadmin%pass"

vsftpd runs as the user "ftpsecure", so I'm assuming this is the
problem.  Does anyone have any suggestions for how to get vsftpd to
have domain admin permissions?  Or maybe another solution?
Thanks,
~M

People I've met are... they generally seem to use DansGuardian patched
to utilize ClamAV.

You might check out this old thread, it relates to a problem in the
2.4 kernels that was supposedly fixed in 2.6, so it shouldn't be
applicable to Fedora Core 2.

http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2003-September/022109.html

I don't think there would be any performance drop from configuring too
much cache.  However, if you actually USE that cache, I bet you see
some problems...

      This is not a technical presentation, because David hasn't
      had time to do much new technical work lately.  Instead he
      has been busy teaching Information Technology at Pioneer 
      Pacific College.
      So, David will discuss a few things he has learned in this 
      position.

              7:00 - 7:30  Business
                   We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects 
                   including PLUG's monthly Advanced Topics meetings, 
                   PLUG's monthly hands on clinics, PLUG for Education,

                   Microsharp is no longer hosting pdxLinux.org.
                   This task has gone to our good friends at

                   conversion to their server(s).
                   David Mandel will also give the group an update
                   on room reservations for 2005.
                   We will also discuss ways of finding speakers for

Cool.  I'm currently using DansGuardian, but I didn't know there was a
ClamAV patch.  I'll check it out.

Message-ID: <BAY20-F4YGQ74CJiHQN0000d3c5@hotmail.com>


Hi:

I got hold of a printer and I would like to make
it available for us under Openoffice.
I typed 'spadmin' and clicked on add a printer.

I have downloaded a .ppd file (from linuxprinting.org)  which I read that
the dialog box in Openoffice "Add a printer" can recognize automatically.
I pointed that dialog box to the right directory where I have that ppd file.
Nothing appear for me to select that printer to be installed.

Did I miss a step?

Thanks for any tip.

Subject: [PLUG] Geometric Diagrams in Lyx?
Message-ID: <418ABE2B.2070107@adnap.no-ip.com>

I'm writing a paper in Lyx and I need to insert a couple simple 
geometric diagrams. I've tried dia and kseg.

dia seems to be oriented towards conceptual modeling, not geometric 
drawing. I can make it work, but the circles come out looking like 
polygons when I use SVG output. Also, I can't figure out how to insert 
greek letters into the drawings.

kseg is definitely for geometry, but it can't export except to bitmap 
formats. It also seems unable to label angles. I haven't tried greek 
letters.

What do you use? If you use these, how can I make them work for me?

Thanks!

Evan

Search google something like this:

http://www.google.com/search?q=insert+images+into+latex&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official

and you will find lot's of advice on converting different formats into
eps and sizing and all that.  I believe that will help you out.

<advice type="unsolicited">
Also, if you have gone to the trouble to figure out lyx (assuming
you've transitioned from the world of Word like I did), you really
should read this:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf

and just use LaTeX.  The basic markup you need to get a great looking
print or pdf is amazingly simple, and the amount of help on the web is
even more astounding.  It's quite a liberating experience.

   Good for you, Evan!

> What do you use? If you use these, how can I make them work for me?

   I looked at 7 different vector-graphics packages (including xfig which I
found had a steep learning curve for drawing the "bell" curves I need in my
book. So I ended up with "tgif" <http://bourbon.usc.edu:8001/tgif/>.

   I enter Greek and mathematical symbols directly and set the "print"
function to .eps. The figures go right into LyX with no problems. BTW, use
figure floats to insert your images and let LaTeX decide where they are best
positioned.

   Holler if you need help. Bill added my explanation of how to annotate
figures on his FAQ page. The _only_ non-easily-grokked part of the program
is learning that when you hover the cursor over an icon the explanation
shows up on the left side of the status bar at the bottom of the window, not
in a little box by the cursor.

   I have at least a couple of dozen figures in my book, all done with tgif,
and I really like it. They print beautifully using pdxlates.

HTH,

Rich

Bryan,

   I must disagree. Try putting a table within a table in straight LaTeX. At
one of the local TUG meetings I showed Ed Sawicki, Geoff Burling and one or
two others just how easy that is in LyX.

   My book is up to 225 pages so far (probably be about 300 with index) and
it's a piece of cake with LyX. Math, tables, figures and all.

I've certainly never written a book, nor used nested tables like that.
 I'm sure a GUI frontend to LaTeX can make the hairier markup much
easier.

I'll admit too that I'm a plain text kind of guy.  I love my emacs,
and anything that let's me stay in that environment really pleases me.
 Is it possible to write most of the document in LaTeX and then import
it into LyX, create a hairy table, and the re-export to LaTeX?  Or
does that totally trash your previous markup?  (I abandonded LyX after
writing only one paper for school, I never became that familiar with
it)

Of course, we should all follow the path that Norm Walsh took and
start using XML to markup our documents, right?

Bryan,

   Not only hairy markup, but all of it.

> I'll admit too that I'm a plain text kind of guy.

   I, too, prefer the command line and text editors. That's why I use pine,
slrn, emacs and joe. However, sometimes the productivity increase of the GUI
front end (LyX) or application (Eclipse) makes too much sense to ignore.
That's also why I run the X Window System (using Xfce) and keep 10 virtual
desktops open with multiple virtual terminals and applications.

   The best answer I can give you is "maybe". I'm not sure of the status of
relyx, the tool designed to import LaTeX into LyX.

   Years ago I tried learning LaTeX and gave up because the curve was too
steep for the time I had available. Then I discovered LyX at a very early
version. It took me about 15 minutes to go through the tutorial and I
started writing articles and reports with it. As I needed to learn more I
used the two built-in documents under the Help menu and the exceptionally
helpful mail list. Never looked back.

   I've no idea how easy it is to generate the ToC or Lists of Figures/Tables
or cross-references in straight LaTeX. It's a breeze in LyX. And, I don't
have to learn all the proper forms of the markup, the software does that for
me when I press the magic keys or select a menu item.

   Nope. What I like is that I will send the .tex output with all the .eps
files (51 so far) to Springer-Verlag and the book will move through
production that much faster: camera-ready copy.

   If folks are interested I can give a tour of LyX at a PLUG meeting. I now
use it for all my writing other than letters and the occasional permit
application. I also find it much easier to read without the distraction of
markup in the words.

I have tgif installed now. How can I make lines snap to circles? I want
to draw a circle with two radii.

Evan,

   What I do is use the 7th icon down the left margin's tool bar (splined
line), then click on the "line" icon on the top row, third from the right.
That one changes from a straight line to a spline curve to interpolated
spline and back to straight.

   I'd then draw the two arcs using 'snap-to-grid' mode, then edit them by
hand to get what I want. The editing is with snap mode turned off. Then you
can turn snap mode back on and put the two together.

   Does this help or do I not understand what you want to do?

   The visible grid and snap functions are on the "layout" menu.

Message-ID: <20041105053312.GA15418@subtend.net>

Debian testing, which is really really close to becoming
the new stable release.

Suddenly, firefox start segfaulting.  Mozilla 1.7.3 is doing
the same thing.

I've tried both the debian stable package (firefox-0.9.3),
and a 1.0 release untar'd into /usr/local/firefox.  All
are segfaulting.

So I thought it might be something related to gtk. I started
weeding out various dot directories, but thought that creating
a new clean user would be the best test.  Poof!  The new 
user created and still all this stuff segfaults.

Interestingly, when run as root or "sudo firefox" it runs
just fine.

I'm stumped.  Some debian bug that I didn't see on an apt-get
dist-upgrade?  If so, I'm sure it will fix itself in a few days.

Any gdb magic I can run to see what exactly is going on?  The
gdb attempt I tried displas a lot of "no debugging symbols" so
I think I have a not-friendly-to-debugging version (makes sense
considering it isn't a cvs release or nightly build).

	I had my hard drive go down a few days ago, taking everything with it

	Got around to configuring CUPS this evening but I'm having problems
with the output at the printer.
	If I print text I get a black(not blank but black) page. The whole page
is printed in black ink.
	If I print a photo then I get page after page of gobblygook. Nonsense
and a waste of ink either way.
	This is a Mandrake 10 installation on a plain home built box with an
Epson Stylus Photo 700 printer. Everything was working fine with the old
install and I have 3 other boxes that are configured exactly the same.
	Can anyone hit me with a clue stick here? I've googled and can't find
any reference to this problem.

Alex,

   What do you have in /etc/cups/printers.conf? Can you invoke either
/usr/sbin/printers or (with your browser of choice)
http://localhost:631/admin (at least, I _think_ that's the syntax)?

   I suspect an incorrect printer defintiion. Both the dialog box and browser
admin tools will allow you to print a test page and that will help to
diagnose the problem.

Try renaming the various mozilla configuration folders in your home 
directory. I've seen this before.

If it's user specific (and it appears it is), then it almost has to be 
something in the user directory causing it.

Subject: [PLUG] SMP big box vs. many small boxen for database / web server
	performance.
Message-ID: <418BF17F.2050003@tercent.com>

Hi PLUGgers,

This is something of a classic problem, I'm sure, but I've been having 
trouble finding current reasoning on it (a lot of 1999-era debates on 
SMP are in Google).


1. In a nutshell, for an Apache / Perl / MySQL web application with a 
mix of DB reads and writes (assume there's a 1:5:2 http:dbread:dbwrite 
ratio, very roughly), which of the two configurations below would, in 
your opinion, give the best performance / value ratio?

	A. one web server and one database server, each with 1 unit processor 
and 1 unit RAM;

	OR

	B. a single machine with 2 x 1 unit processor and 2 unit RAM?


2. And corollary to 1.:

	- if A is your choice, are there numbers that make B compelling?  In 
other words, what if B contained quad processors, or 4 units RAM?

	- if the scenario is changed so that you are comparing 2 x (1 unit RAM, 
1 unit CPU) + 1 x (2 unit RAM, 2 unit CPU) versus 1 x (4 unit ram, 4 x 1 
unit CPU), does your choice remain the same?


In effect, my question boils down to the efficacy of putting the 
equivalent number of CPU and RAM chips into a single box where, 
presumably, the failure rate will be lower due to fewer points of 
failure.  Also, it seems that even with a fairly slow bus, local socket 
talk to a MySQL server would be much faster than putting it out over the 
network.  Since the DB will be disk-limited, and the Web app probably 
network-limited, it seems like they would play well together in the same 
chassis.

Thoughts?

In my opinion, a single box beats two every time: network lag isn't an 
issue, there are fewer hardware component that can fail, and time 
spent on system administration is reduced significantly.

I'd only go with two boxes if a) you're really stressing the system or 
b) you have plans to make the database available to other applications 
on the network.

If it's a production application, I'd try to budget for two boxes, 
using one for development or, worst case, a hot spare.

Have you done any testing of your application under real-life loads to 
get a feel for what stress you'll be putting on the hardware?

The reason I ask is that I have a really hard time envisioning a 
semi-standard LAMP-ish application coming close to stressing even a 
low-end P4 or Athlon unless you're expecting a daily hit count 
numbering in the hundreds of thousands.

Maybe he's working on a Boinc project... :-\

Look at all the issues Berkeley has had with their LAMP-ish setup.  Or
CERN.  Or Scripps.

Berkeley wrote some software, Boinc (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for
Network Computing), to run DC projects like their own SETI at Home, CERN's
LHC at Home, or Scripps' Predictor at Home.  It's fairly LAMP-ish software,
although Berkeley is currently using SAMP (Solaris)... it's Apache,
MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python, with a bit of C and C++ on the client side
(and a bit on the server side).

Those projects have been continually plagued by load issues; they aren't
scaling well at all.  LHC at Home has a decent amount of iron to throw at
it, and with 6000 users can't keep up. Scripps is in the process of
getting a real server set up at the moment.

Google around, check out their websites... they're having issues.  The
OP may find some insight, as the projects have all been switching
between multiple systems and trying a single big system to see how
things work out.

That said, it's a good project... it just needs some work.  :-)

   My question is NOT intended as flame-bait, but to address a DB issue that
used to be a hot topic on mail lists: MySQL vs. PostgreSQL when there is a
high level of writing to the tables.

   My understanding of the issue is that MySQL was optimized for reads so it
was frequently the DB of choice for Web apps where reads outdid writes by
many orders of magnitude. But, postgres was the application of choice when
records were frequently updated.

   Just out of curiosity, has this changed? I don't really care one way or
the other because I stay with postgres for all my applications and I really
don't care what anyone else uses. As I wrote, I'm just curious if MySQL is
now more balanced than I understood it once was.

Thanks,

Rich

If you comb through the Slashdot history they've talked about their 
experience with this issue. I'd expect kuro5hin would have something
similar.  Andrew Tennenbaum would have comments from his recent 
experience.  Though I expect that was mostly bandwidth and connection
processing limited.

Nope.  I created a new user with an empty homedir and it still failed.

I'm guessing you haven't rebooted during this whole process?  If not,
you might check SHM segments; I've had Mozilla fail to start because of
one that didn't get deleted.

Subject: [PLUG] Kooka
Message-ID: <200411051803.34231.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

Is anyone using Kooka? (This is a front end(?) to SANE - at least I think I've 
said that the right way.) The version I installed today using YaST is:

Kooka 0.44 (Using KDE 3.2.1)

I'm just beginning to experiment with it. I have successfully installed it on 
my SuSE 9.1 machine, and can scan with it. I'm trying to use the OCR feature 
(it uses gocr, which is installed and sort of works).

The kooka documentation I get on my system is rather limited. I did a Google 
search and found other SuSE documentation for kooka that is more complete at:

http://shelob.temple.edu/suse/local/suselinux-userguide_en/ch19s02.html

However, there are discrepancies between the documentation and the program. 
The documentation says to scan in binary, but I the program calls that 
Lineart (that's consistant with the Windows scanner driver that I'm used to 
using). 

More important is that the instructions say to select a section of the 
pre-scanned image and pre-scan again to cut down on the amount to be scanned. 
This doesn't work, or I'm not doing it right.

Another problem is that I have not found a preferred image format for gocr. 
BMP sort of works, but has problems with the fancy font in the booklet I'm 
trying to scan. Does anyone know if there's a preferred format? There are 
quite a few available, from BMP to XV (whatever that is). I'll experiment 
with a few and see what differences I get, but I'll appreciate any other 
shared experience.

Thanks in advance.

The debugging symbols are not present if the program was not compiled with
the "-g" switch for gcc present, or if it was present but the resulting
binary was then run through the "strip" utility. Generally, packaged
programs from distros don't have the symbols present, because (IIUC) they
take up memory while the program is running.

For what its worth.. I just upgraded to Suse 9.2 this evening which
includes Kooka 0.44.

I've never used Kooka but here is a clip from the included Handbook...


The main window in Kooka consists of three frames. At the top, see both
icon and a menu panels. Use the mouse to enlarge or reduce the windows
as needed.

The navigation window consists of two tabs, which allow you to switch
between the Preview and the integrated file browser called the Gallery.
The working folder is displayed in the lower part of the window along
with the folder where the scan will be saved.

Make your scanner-dependent settings, which are dependent on the scanner
you have connected, in the lower left window. Usually, these are
settings for resolution, brightness and contrast, scanning mode (e.g.,
color, gray, or binary), and for gamma values.

Configure your settings here first. Afterwards, initiate the preview
scan with Preview. If the Preview tab in the upper window is selected,
see the results there.

Select the various formats in the preview image itself to define the
final dimensions. The User setting is recommended for this, so you
select the area to scan in the preview display with the mouse.

After this is done, click Scan to scan the selection made in the
preview. After scanning, you will be asked in which format to save the
image whether to make this your standard format (without being prompted
to confirm your selection in the future).

Note

If you checked that you do not want to be asked about the save format,
the memory assistant will no longer appear. To change the format some
time in the future, select Settings->Configure Kooka...->Save
Image->Always show memory assistant


The large window shows how the image appears after a final scan.

Did you buy or download it? (I am still on 9.0.) Was the upgrade a

I bought the upgrade version from buy.com. The upgrade went very smooth.
The ftp version of 9.2 doesn't seem to be available yet.

I successfully set up a patched version of DG with ClamAV:

http://www.harvest.com.br/asp/afn/dg.nsf

My config currently has one Squid process that does ad blocking and
NTLM authentication to an Active Directory server.  Then it forwards
to DG for virus scanning and then forwards on to a second Squid
process that does the caching.

I experimented last night and found that gocr doesn't seem to care in which 
format the image is saved. I tried all of them and got the same OCR results 
with each.

I figured out the odd thing about the documentation saying to use "binary" but 
not having binary as an option in the program. Turns out that the program 
uses "Lineart" to mean binary. That's consistant with what the Windows driver 
calls it, and while binary conveys the concept to a programmer, line art 
probably works better for a graphic artist. Now that I know the synonymous 
relationship, I no longer care!

I'm not sure why the Mailman CGI doesn't advertise it, but there's an
mbox of everything at
lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug.mbox/plug.mbox

However, it's 106MB; I don't know why the cron'd gzip job doesn't do
this one too, but I just made a bzip2 at

Paul,

Are there any pitfalls that you would advise folks to look out for when 
relying upon a single machine for both database and Web duties?  Keeping 
data and web logs / files on separate spindles is of course a must.  Is 
bus speed a big concern in this case?  Or will disk and network IO be 
much more rate limiting?

And, to Rich:

MySQL and PostgreSQL are nowadays pretty close to each other in 
performance, realistically speaking, and I hold it comes down to a 
choice of style.  The MySQL vs. PostgreSQL debate is a staple of the 
open source world, and it's actually quite an interesting one, but 
should not be rehashed here (there's tons of well-informed stuff on the 
web).  My recommendation is to work with both and see what fits your 
style.  What fit my style immediately many years back was MySQL all the 
way -- it's much friendlier to a novice's set of assumptions and his 
probable problem domain.  Once I got familiar with databases, however, 
PostgreSQL won me over.  At this point, I would almost always choose 
PostgreSQL over MySQL (legacy apps are another matter, however).

Without impugning MySQL, I would suggest that the novice with a more 
leisurely pace, or with a larger-scale project before him choose 
PostgreSQL, while he who must write code to work *now*, damn the 
torpedoes, will probably find MySQL a quicker route (or SQLite, a newish 
delight in the low-end of the market).

Best,

Randall

   I've been building database applications since dBASE II on Kaypros running
CP/M. What I have seen over and over is the lack of understanding of how to
design and build a relational database, regardless of what DBMS one runs.
About 13 years ago I worked briefly doing some database work for a medical
research project. They were using R:base and had no idea how to normalize
data or run a relational database. So, it was all a humongeous flat file
(with more than 100 columns, IIRC).

   Anytime a patient had an additional bypass or other procedure a new column
was added. All tuples were empty but that one. Just for giggles, I redid the
entire database in Paradox/DOS and discovered several patient records were
duplicated (or triplicated). Different data in each copy, too. When I
pointed that out and mentioned that it just might screw up the statistics
drawn from the data we decided that I should not rock their boat any longer.

   So, I recommend that a novice get two books: one on database design and
normalization and the other a Joe Celko book on SQL. Only after reading both
should that novice be allowed to touch a dbms.

   The analogy I've used for years when folks tell me that they have a GIS
package installed so they can do spatial analyses is that teaching someone
how to use a word processor does not make her/him a writer. The difference
between knowing how to run a computer application and knowing when to run it
and how to set it up to produce useful answers is one of my pet peeves.

   And I do clean the peeves cage regularly and keep it well supplied with
fresh water and dolts for food.

   I know that some of you have the IBM ThinkPad 600E. My fiancee uses that
as her machine and comes up with applications suddenly -- and
instantaneously -- shutting down. OO.o, thunderbird and firefox seem to be
the ones that do this.

   As I've never encountered this on other machines I'm wondering if others
have seen this behavior before. We're running Slackware-10.0 on all boxes,
if that matters.

   I don't work on the ThinkPad enough to see this happen, but I hear the
screams from the den when it happens to her. Without experiencing SAD
(Sudden Application Death) I don't know where to start looking.

   Any ideas?

Thanks,

Rich

This could be low memory. Those three applications are memory hogs and
might be being killed when they ask for more.

Whatever it is, starting the application from a terminal window will let
you see its dying gasps when it croaks.

B, since your DB traffic is higher than your net traffic, not that
it'll matter with real world bandwidth.  Also, a single box is easier
to admin and offers fewer points of failure.  *nix handles multiple
things on a single box far more gracefully than the competition.

Honestly, I doubt you'll need the dual proc, even.  Modern CPUs are
really, really fast.  Get it working and tested on a generic
single-proc 3+ GHz box with a good mobo, half gig of RAM and an IDE
drive, and then upgrade from there.  First suggestion would be
mirrored hotswap SCSI disks.

If you simply *must* get a box to stick in the colo right away, get a
2U rackmount from Dell (PE2650's good) or Supermicro.

If the web frontend was simple and lightweight, and the DB was huge
and handling complex queries.  In that case, you're basically spending
the money on a heavier DB server instead of a separate web server.

That's too complex.  Don't make us do your homework for you, man.

You're overthinking the problem.  Also, I think you may have some
order-of-magnitude misconceptions of the relative bandwidths of system
buses, LANs, typical Internet connections and DB traffic.

Computer hardware gets cheaper, faster and better really quickly.
Buying just what you need now is generally the best strategy.

   Aha! Good thought. I need to check how much memory it has. Probably time

   See prefers working from runlevel 4 (== 5 on Red Hat and derivatives).
But, we can try launching them from a vt rather than the panel.

Subject: [PLUG] MAX OSX Panther compromised twice...
Message-ID: <1099817537.22543.42.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

An iBook has been compromised twice now.  My suspicion is that it's a
BSD tcp/ip stack problem.  Rumor has it that ipfw can be bypassed
through an exploit involving the tcp/ip stack.  Whoever did the
compromise, there were no services running on the machine yet they
managed to mount NFS shares remotely and cause strange udp activity
to occur.  This is a very new iBook and it has already gone back
to CompUSA once for a $250 hard drive pull.  Does the iBook have
a compromisable bios?  Can the owner of this iBook clean it up 
or does it have to go back for another $250 hard drive pull?

Googling, it appears there's a weakness in the help system that can
be exploited when you web browse on the Internet.  There's also an
ssh problem, apparently you can be telnetting without even realizing
it.

BSD is supposedly the system to build a firewall with.  What's wrong
with the kernel and what's the fix?  There's one upgrade kernel from
apple, but I don't know that it fixes any tcp/ip stack problem.
There's supposedly a security patch for the help system, I'm
surprised CompUSA didn't take care of this.

Short of being able to figure out what the weakness is, I've suggested
to my friend that he fix my alpha and use it as a router running Linux 
to protect his iBook.  He went from a pc laptop to an iBook thinking
better security.  Any help appreciated.

   Well, I discovered part of the problem after Evan got me looking at the
amount of RAM installed (it's 128M): for whatever reason, I did not put a
swap partition on this the last time I re-did the OS! Mea culpa! That's
inexcusable, but here I am with a big boo-boo.

   I have lots of disk space so I'm wondering if there's a way -- on a live
system in single-user mode, of course -- to take some space from /dev/hda2
and make it into a swap partition. I have hda1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 on this box. I
also don't have parted (the partition editor).

   Sigh. If I'm going to goof it will not be half-way.

   Aha! I wasn't that negligent. I did make a swap partition (/dev/hda8, when
it should have been /dev/hda2, but anyway ...) but it's not showing up in
/etc/fstab. I discovered this by running 'parted /dev/hda print'.

   Edited /etc/fstab and rebooted ... et voila! There's 256M of swap. Whew!
Thanks, Evan, for reminding me to look at the memory. However, since she
uses a lot of GUI apps I think I will add more RAM. The 600E will take up to
288M (that's the installed 32M plus two additional 128M modules).

   Now we'll see if them apps stay up.

Excelsior! (No, Dick, not the packing material.)

How complex and/or busy will this application be? If you're expecting 
no more than a few thousand page views per day, and each page few 
generates just a dozen or so simple database queries, then buy a fleet 
of cheap P-IIIs so you have hot-spares a-plenty.

If you're expecting 100,000+ page views per day and/or those pages 
rely on some gnarly database queries -- then you might end up 
stressing some hardware.

Honestly, I don't think any of us are qualified to spec a system for 
your web app unless we understand how busy and complex it will be.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0411071406290.30435@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I was bitten twice by this bug. I hope that this time I remember about it.

   Anywho, if any of you are going to upgrade from X.org-6.7.0 to X.org-6.8.0
or -6.8.1 be aware that X ain't gonna' start when you're done. Of course, if
you're booting into a GUI login you'll not see it, so you'll need to boot
'linux single' to fix the problem.

   The report (and /var/log/X.org.0.log) indicate that the core keyboard
cannot be loaded because there is no such module. Of course, there is
/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/input/keyboard_<something>.o, but ...

   In the revised /etc/xorg.conf's "Keyboard" section you'll see that the
device is listed as:
 	device "Keyboard"
which is why the driver won't load. Change the above line to:
 	device "keyboard"
and life is once again good.

   Case counts!

   OK. I need help with this one; can't figure it out myself. So far.

   I upgraded the laptop from X.org-6.7.0 to X.org-6.8.0 and fixed the "K/k"
error in the conf file. Prior to the upgrade /etc/inittab was set for
run level 4 (Slackware's GUI login) and this has worked just fine.

   Since the upgrade the machine no longer completes the boot process, It
tries to invoke X, falls back, tries again, falls back, then ends up at the
prompt "Starting X server" where it waits patiently for me to reboot the
box.

   /var/log/kdm.log tells me nothing other than it cannot find a couple of
font directories so it took those off the list and it cannot find
'libmng.so.1' which is apparently for mng graphic files (whatever they are;
I haven't any of those files and haven't seen them before. I also see
nothing in /var/log/Xorg.0.log that gives me any clue.

   What's strange is that I can boot into run level 3 then run 'startxfce4'
and X comes right up. Ergo, it must be something with kdm, no?

Any ideas?

TIA,

Rich

   I would appreciate a pointer from those of you who use Thunderbird.

   I just upgraded my fiancee's laptop from thunderbird-0.8 to -0.9. Had to
create the accounts all over again and now I cannot find the messages she
had. Not nice.

   In what directory does thunderbird put the mail? I have ~/Mail for her; is
that correct? I did not find anything in Tools->Account Setup that would let
me point it at whereever the former version was looking. Since I don't use
this MUA I am completely unfamiliar with it.

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Wiki that behaves under CVS (not based upon CVS)
Message-ID: <418ECD7E.2020804@tercent.com>

Hi folks,

I'm looking for a wiki engine that plays particularly nicely with CVS. 
Meaning: I can check out the wiki codebase to my server and to my 
laptop, edit wiki pages on my laptop while offline, and run a cvs add / 
cvs commit once I get back online, then cvs update everyone and my 
server and laptop both have the same wiki pages.

I'm trying this with useModWiki right now but there's some impedance 
mismatch -- occasionally, permissions will get fubarred, revision 
control in the wiki itself seems to get corrupted, etc.

If there were a Very Simple wiki that didn't bother with its own 
revision control, and for which all the files created were plaintext, 
this would hit the spot.

I'm combing through http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiEngines right now, but I 
thought I'd ask if other have used a wiki in the way I describe, and 
what engine they found best.

Thanks,

Randall

   More information. After a lot of detective work I discovered that in her
~/.thunderbird/ directory there are three subdirectories with mail, all
created on different dates. The one that has her actual Inbox and messages
is well-buried and I don't know how to point thunderbird to that one. Every
time I try to invoke the thunderchicken, it comes up then immediately shuts
down with a seq fault. Sigh. I've no idea if there is any logic to the
creation of directories by any mozilla product. Here's what I found (with
creation dates in parentheses after the directory name):

~/.thunderbird/8rdf4j9u.default/(Nov 7; created when I updated from .8 to
.9)

~/.thunderbird/Pamela/lbzzc39h.slt/ (Jul 4)

~/.thunderbird/default (Jun 19)/
 	vtlnellx.slt (Nov 7)/
 		Mail (Jun 19)/
 			salmo (Nov 6)/
 				Inbox (Nov 7; earlier today with the 0.8
version)

   It is the last one that has all the files I need to be able to access. The
two former ones are ... what? Superfluous? Distracting?

   Is there a Web site that explains how these directories are generated?
Better yet, any place I can learn how to point thunderbird at the last
string so I can get this app working?

Thanks,

Rich

If a binary can't find a library it is looking for, it will not run.

Install the package libmng.so.1 is found in and go from there.

take down an iBook?  Anyone?  This has happened twice to a Unix based

on by the ipfw firewall.  This is the newest MacOS-X on the market,
so it is highly disturbing that it was exploited so quickly and
that this machine has been hacked not once, but twice now.

How could this have been done without tripping any anti viral scanners?
The person doing this managed to mount NFS shares with a strong ipfw
ruleset in place.

Do iBooks have hidden default passwords that need to be changed?

How do you clean an iBook up?

I'm not an OS X expert, but you piqued my interest as my sister and
her kids have 3 ibooks and a powerbook (as well as a G4 desktop tower
for the husband) on a wireless connection, and have had no (known)
troubles whatsoever.

Here's the first link I came across when googling for "apple os x ipfw".

http://developer.apple.com/internet/security/securityintro.html

When I added "exploit" to the same search phrase, there were a few
more links to read.

Happy reading...

Try Kwiki: http://www.kwiki.org

You'll need to install a plug-in and that will allow version control

Holger, Paul, Russell, et al.:

   Did I mention on this list that OO.o has a label template for the Avery
labels? If not, I'll close the thread by stating that they do. And it works
very well.

Thanks,

This is great.  I have been fighting a simialt problem for sevreal months 
but it has never been high enough on the priority list until last week.

Background:

    1.4G Athalon with 1G RAM.  Several older SCSI drives.  Then one SCSI
drive fails ... with the swap partition.  So since it has 1G RAM I figure
I could get by without swap.  And did for quite awhile.  Then some reports
stopped running/finishing.  I fiddled and fiddled as the messages in the
logs were cryptic to say the least.  Then last week I caved and took the
/opt partition and made it swap but since it was only 128M I created a 1G
swap file on another partion (that had the room.)
   The reports now run and finish.


So the question:

How do I determine which and how much of the swap(s) are being used?  


TIA,
Rod

Rod,

   I'm reaching far beyond my expertise here for the first part of your
question. For the second part, use 'top'. I suspect that the kernel picks
and choses based on a rather sophisticated algorithm which partition is the
most advantageous at any given moment when swap is needed. Regardless,
probably 1G of swap is sufficient and the 128M could return to its previous
job of being /opt.

Hey Rod...

Do you have any of those SMALLER HD's say 1-4GB range?
If so... install one on your computer... and make the entire HD swap!!
This way you will still have a good swap.. but it won't slow your computer
down as much when it swaps because it's using a different drive.

Subject: [PLUG] httpd down
Message-ID: <200411081846.29720.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

I have Apache running on a machine in the basement that just serves the house 
(as opposed to being seen by the Internet). It has just been sitting there 
running for months, but today something isn't working. The machine is up, but 
when I try to connect to one of the web pages on that site (which I haven't 
done for some weeks) from another machine in the house, the connection is 
refused (the words vary depending on which browser I'm using). I logged in to 
the machine and ran ps ax, looking for httpd. It wasn't there. I tried 
starting it, by simply typing (as root) httpd and now, when I try to connect 
from another machine, I get the text of the HTML file, instead of the proper 
index.html page. So, I have two questions:

1. Any idea why this otherwise stable service would have crashed? The machine 
doesn't do much. The only other thing on it of significance is my mp3 
collection. The last couple of evenings I've successfully run mpg123 and 
aumix on it, connecting via putty from a Win98 machine (the audio output of 
the Linux machine is wired to the living room).

2. What's the right way to restart httpd?

3. Any other thought on this problem are also welcomed.

Dick,

   If there's no process ID to be found then you cannot do 'SIGHUP pid'.
That's the way to restart a process so it reads its config file after
changes.

   Depends on the distribution. There is an 'apachectl' file somewhere on
your system. In Slackware it's /usr/sbin/apachectl. I recall reading
somewhere that this is the approved way to start httpd. Your distribution
may also have what I have here in /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ less /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd 
#!/bin/sh
#
# /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd
#
# Start/stop/restart the Apache web server.
#
# To make Apache start automatically at boot, make this
# file executable:  chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd
#

case "$1" in
    'start')
       /usr/sbin/apachectl start ;;
    'stop')
       /usr/sbin/apachectl stop ;;
    'restart')
       /usr/sbin/apachectl restart ;;
    *)
       echo "usage $0 start|stop|restart" ;;
esac

   This does the same thing, but from the sysinit setup.

Are you using automatic updates?  Anything of note in Apache's error
log?  (I'm assuming it's Apache.)

I've successfully edited the pages of MoinMoin directly.  It does have
its own revision control, but I think you could ignore it.

I forgot to mention the distribution: RH 7.0.

I didn't find apachectl, but I I found /etc/rc1.d/K15httpd which, when called 
with the option start, started Apache, and I was able to connect to the site 
normally. I had a feeling it was some file like that, but hadn't worked with 
them in a long time, so I had forgotten where they were. Thanks for the 
memory jog.

Good a reason as any. There was a power failure a few weeks ago, but since 
everything else came back up, I didn't think to check Apache. Maybe it was 
related to that.

Yes, it is Apache, but no, I'm not updating this machine. As I mentioned in my 
reply to Rich, the only thing I can think of that happened in recent memory 
is a power failure a couple of months ago. But, since everything else came 
back up, I didn't check Apache. While I have a surge protector on this 
machine, I don't have a battery backup for it. Got to get another one of 
those one of these days.

RH 7.0, and Rich pointed me in the right direction. Thanks.

Message-ID: <20041109191810.GI26671@dalsemi.com>

I have a Compaq 1800R that I use to host my church's website.  It has
a pair of 4.7 Gb drives with RAID 1 running in the hardware-based RAID
hot-swappable drive bay.

Through two very generous donations, I've gotten a pair of 9 Gb and
18Gb drives.  I'd love to be able to use all 4 drives in the same
configuration that I currently have, with RAID 1 across the drives
for a total of 27 Gb.  And maybe have the extra 4.7 Gb to house
/tmp and the swap space.

Is that even possible?  I've been Googling for things like

Compaq RAID heterogeneous

but so far I've only found things for more recent SAN and NAS
solutions.

Thanks,
Colin

If you use software RAID it is possible, because it just uses
partitions.  It's very unlikely to work with hardware RAID, because the
controllers usually want control over the whole disk.

Hi Richard,

1. When you went to restart httpd, you just invoked the program as root 
-- it probably didn't get the right options for startup, like file 
locations and modules to use.  If you were missing one of the 
more-or-less standard modules to apache, like the MIME determination 
modules, it may not have been able to guess the file types and so served 
plaintext.

2. When you found /etc/rc1.d/KNNhttpd, you found the runlevel 1 (rc1.d) 
non-start (kill -- "K") in alphanumeric order ("NN") script for httpd. 
Each runlevel (Redhat as a server usually uses 3, debian 2) has a rc.d 
directory with symlinks to the main init directory (generally 
/etc/rc.d/init.d), and the naming of the symlinks determines what is 
done on startup.  "K" services are not started.  "S" services are 
started in NN order with "start" as first argument.  The "K" services, 
however, are still symlinks to the /etc/rc.d/init.d scripts that 
actually start and stop things -- only the first letter of the symlink 
name is different -- which is why you were able to run that script with 
"start" to get up and running again.

If you have services that need to start in order, you use the NN numbers 
to order them -- notice that SNNnetworking is before SMMhttpd, since 
httpd needs networking up to run.

Redhat has something called "chkconfig" which I believe handles this 
stuff, if you're not into organizing the symlinks by hand.

Starting a service in this manner doesn't give any guarantees that it 
will be restarted if it crashes, IIRC.  You may want to look at a tool 
published by DJB that does just that, if things get too crashprone.

You may also want to examine your uptime and runlevel.  If your computer 
was rebooted lately and went into a runlevel where the init script was 
"K" -- "do not start" -- then that may explain things.  Even the apache 
from an old Red Hat should be stable enough not to mysteriously quit 
under no load.  Apache error log *may* have more to say about it as well.

Best,

Randall

You're looking for RAID 1+0 (aka 10) support (generally, you don't want
the similar RAID 0+1). -ENOCLUE if your specific hardware supports that,
you'll need to play around with the RAID bios or look in the users manual,
if you can find it. The only manual I could find was for an 1850R, and
if it's to be believed, the only RAID configs it supports are 0, 1, 4,
and 5. You could also do the 3 RAID 1 images in hardware, and then use
software RAID 0 to get your 27 GB image.

Eh wot? Hardware controllers certainly exist that support RAID 1+0;
controlling partitions versus the whole disk doesn't affect that.  Whether
his hardware does or not all depends on the quality of the RAID chipset.
Mind you, I find software RAID to be more flexible to use and administer.

Hmm... yeah.  I wasn't thinking of 1+0; I was thinking of doing 5 across
4 9-G partitions.  1+0 would only give him 18G; 5 would give him 27G and
a hot spare.

lsof | grep REG    will filter out a lot of the info you don't want.
lsof <filename>  will only return info about that file, likewise:
lsof /usr/bin/*  ,for example will do what you would expect, so
combining find and some other magic, a line like this should do it:

find <root of interest> <possible file mask(s) w/ find magic> | xargs lsof 

eg:
find / -name "*.txt" | xargs lsof 
will give you all users with .txt files (and those files) open on your system

add some perl...

find / -name "*.txt" | xargs lsof  | 
perl -e 'foreach(<>){@fields = split(/\s+/); print "$fields[2] $fields[8]\n";}'

to get just the username & file (all one line--and there has to be a
shorter sollution...)  I'm sure someone with a bigger perl hat can
easily work in a uniqueness check, so you only get one line / user.

HTH,
-Rogan

The +D option in lsof will limit your search to a specific directory 
or set of directories:

   lsof +D /home

In a pipeline, it's fairly easy to get a list of user names and open 
files:

   lsof +D /home | grep -w REG | awk '{print $3" "$9}'

RAID 1+0 could give him 27GB as well: one RAID 1 set across the 18GB
drives, and one RAID 1 set across the 9 GB drives; then RAID 0 (or I
suppose LVM) across those RAID 1 sets to get the full 27GB. As far as
I understand it, there's no requirement that all the disks in RAID 1+0
all be the same size. Though again, whether a hardware based chipset
will support that configuration depends on the implementation, but
software RAID under linux will allow this.

Subject: [PLUG] VMware app printing conundrum
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0411100840260.23194@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I need the collective wisdom of the group here to help me figure this out.

   Summary: I can no longer print from an application running on the virtual
win98 since the printers were changed from direct (on parallel ports) to
network nodes.

   In the guest OS I changed the printer name to the current, correct one.
Tried printing a test page, then canceled the job when the printer display
asked me to load a sheet of paper in the manual feed tray. Now I can no
longer print a test page either. I'm using the proper printer names (as
defined in /etc/cups/printers.conf). Cannot print from the application,
either.

   I can, however, print to a disk file (e.g., map2.prn). But, I cannot
figure out how to send that file to the printer over the network. I tried
the standard cups way of printing a file from the command line, but that
failed:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ lpr -Pcolorp map2.prn 
lpr: error - unable to print file: client-error-document-format-not-supported

   In /etc/cups/printers.conf the printer is defined as:

<DefaultPrinter colorp>
Info Color InkJet 2500C
Location office
DeviceURI socket://colorp:9100

   Is there a way to copy the file to the socket?

   I'm stymied and don't know how to get printing to work again from within
the legacy win app.

TIA,

Rich

   Here's some more information that makes this all the more puzzling to me.

   1.) I changed the laser printer definitions to the two used in
/etc/cups/printers.conf (one single-side the other double-side) and both
test pages printed just fine from within the win98 printer dialog box.

   2.) From within the HP 2500C Toolkit installed on the virtual machine I
can print a test page and clean the print heads when the printer is defined
as in the previous message (i.e., \\SALMO\colorp). So, the virtual machine
recognizes the cups name and finds the right cable from the network switch.

   3.) From within the win98 printer dialog box I cannot print a test page. I
created a new driver, \\salmo\colorp, to no avail.

   4.) Still cannot print maps from the GIS using that definition.

More puzzled,

Rich

What would be the simplest way to find out and list who has how much mail?

Is that clear enough?  I hope so.

I would think there would be a utility to do this in perl or something

I have a USB mouse working well.  But the KVM switch I just bought has
ps2 connectors only.  I tried to use a usb2ps2 adapter at the switch and
a ps22usb adaptor at the computer but to no avail.  It may be easier
to configure it correctly for a ps2 mouse.  how does one do that?

I guess I've always assumed that RAID0 required the physical volumes to
be the same.  Now that I look at the Software-RAID-HOWTO, it _does_ say
that RAID0 volumes needn't be the same size.

Yeah, hardware RAID never as flexible as software.

It has also been incorporated into a mediawiki extension (found at
www.wickle.com), if anyone uses / runs a mediawiki...

(I added a source code syntax highlighter I'm some what proud of, last
night also, if anyone is interested)

Yes but it used to think I had a USB mouse.  So now it's confused.
Even though I'm still plugged into the USB port with an adaptor.

Subject: [PLUG] Sharing calendar data with Thunderbird and Firefox
	extensions.
Message-ID: <4192B383.6080902@comcast.net>

Suse 9.0 Personal
Thunderbird 0.9
Firefox 1.0

After installing the calendar extension for both my browser and email 
client, I wanted to be able to share the data. That is, I didn't want to 
have to enter my appointments twice. I found that the data is contained 
in a file called CalendarDataFile.ics. Each application has this file 
initially located in ~/.mozilla/firefox/default.g9k/Calendar for the 
browser, and ~/.thunderbird/default.rvo/Calendar for the mail client. As 
I had first set up my calendar in Firefox, I wanted the same schedule 
information available when I brought up the calendar in Thunderbird. I 
first deleted ~/.thunderbird/default.rvo/Calendar/CalendarDataFile.ics, 
then while still in ~/.thunderbird/default.rvo/Calendar, I created a 
symbolic link to 
~/.mozilla/firefox/default.g9k/Calendar/CalendarDataFile.ics.

ln -s 
/home/mel/.mozilla/firefox/default.g9k/Calendar/CalendarDataFile.ics 
CalendarDataFile.ics

Viola! I now see the same appointments, in either calendar.

Subject: [PLUG] Stack location variance on RH9.0, not on RH8.0
Message-ID: <31122-24646@sneakemail.com>

Folks:

I'm in the process of writing a paper on a linux stack overflow exploit,
and one of the things I noticed when running the exploit against a Red Hat
9.0 system is the return address to the exploit code was impossible to
nail down to the degree of precision needed.

However, on Red Hat 8.0 the needed return address was very consistent.  I
finally reduced the problem to an inconsistent stack location on a default
(unpatched) install of Red Hat 9.0.  The cheezy sample code attached will
display the stack pointer based on the address of a newly allocated local
variable.  (Is there a better way to find the current value of the stack
pointer in C?)

When run on Red Hat 8.0, I see:

-----
$ for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ./stackp; done
&sp is 0xbffffb44
&sp is 0xbffffb44
&sp is 0xbffffb44
&sp is 0xbffffb44
&sp is 0xbffffb44
-----

However, when run on Red Hat 9.0, I see:

-----
$ for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ./stackp; done
&sp is 0xbffff8c4
&sp is 0xbffff844
&sp is 0xbffff744
&sp is 0xbffff644
&sp is 0xbffff5c4
-----

There's a definite pattern to the location of the stack pointer on Red Hat
9, but I don't know why it wouldn't be the same as Red Hat 8.  Was this a
security feature?  Unintended consequences of some other change?  The
locations aren't random enough for this to be a result of one of the many
stack protection schemes out there.

My googling led me to the same question, without any definitive answer:

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?threadid=148002

Anyone know why Red Hat 9.0 does this?

prelink(8)

     When assigning addresses to libraries, start with random address
     within architecture dependant virtual address space range.  This
     can  make  some  buffer  overflow  attacks  slightly  harder  to
     exploit, because libraries are not present on the same addresses
     accross  different  machines.    Normally,   assigning   virtual
     addresses  starts at the bottom of architecture dependant range.

First, is that what I mean? Suppose you have a rather
capable Linux computer with an Ethernet connection
(that is, a unit capable of functioning as a server)
and you'd like to share these resources with a second
user, using some kind of "thin client" with its own
monitor, mouse, and keyboard. This other unit would
run programs installed on the server.

Well, then? Can anyone direct me to appropriate
sources of information?

Hi:

I just migrated from XFree86 to X.org.  I have S-Video TVOUT
and it was working fine under XFree86.  I tried
to configure my xorg.conf file to set in the S-Video TVOUT
but nothing seems to work.  X won't fire up on my TV.

Is someone willing to share their xorg.conf file as sample
for me to see how you consider S-Video TVOUT to work
on yours?

Thanks

Unfortunately, I haven't used prelink.  I also see the same behavior
when I statically link the sample code in my original message, which
eliminates a lot of ldd-strangeness possibilities:

The fact that Red Hat 9 does this is a good thing from a security
perspective, but a bad thing from a security research perspective.

Message-ID: <20041111211520.GA27787@gate.kl-ic.com>


It turns out I have been passing out some bad Knoppix disks.  
I verify every disk after writing it, but some have gone gunnysack
in the field.  Bit rot?  

The disks are Memorex brand, identifiable by a inner label starting
with "LH3513 HJ042 ____ __" .  If you have recently gotten a KNOPPIX 3.6A
disk from me,  please test it with a "knoppix testcd" after the boot
prompt.  If it is flaky, I will swap with you at the next meeting.

Is it dead, or is it Memorex?  Unfortunately, some of these places use
cheap Indian manufactured disk-du-jour, and sometimes they are great and
sometimes they are junk.  Worst case is when they fall apart a long time
after writing.

To date, I have had the best luck with Fuji media.  I have had bad luck
with TDK, Dysan, Imation, Verbatim, HP, and cheap-store-brand. I'm still
testing Sony.  Knoppix disks write all the way out to the edge, and the
"good zone" for some of these disks may be confined to the first 600MB
or so.  I write the disks with Liteon 52X drives, two at a time.

I use Taiyo Yuden media (I think that's how you spell it) and have never 
had a problem with it. They don't have any labels on top, allowing you 
to put your own label (e.g. knoppix) without worrying about the stuff in 
the back showing up.

Is that available retail around here?  That's the best media for my

Hey-

Spreadfirefox (sfx) is currently looking for college students to help
market/campaign firefox on college campuses. Currently they are looking
for students from universities in the following states: California,
Oregon, Indiana and New York. Personally, I have been involved with this
specific campaign -- so I would hope many of you check out this
opportunity to get involved in the community.

Post: http://www.spreadfirefox.com/
Application: http://www.spreadfirefox.com/apply.php

The job would entail advocating firefox in many forms (getting it into
labs, hanging posters, etc).

Lets show the community how much support there is at Oregon State! If
you have any friends that might be interested at other schools (such as
PSU, UO, etc) feel free to pass the link onto them too ;)

ALSO: There is an OSLUG meeting tomorrow (11/12/04) 6pm. If you have
questions regarding the sfx app -- you can hit me up there.

Go beavs! .. and foxes?

Subject: [PLUG] Network question
Message-ID: <1100279979.5026.36.camel@einstein.seansdomain.org>

I need to test latency and packet loss on specific router interfaces
(about 10,000 interfaces).  My plan is to select a random device on the
interface and ping it 10 times, and storing the best, worst, average and
packet loss in a database table.  The issue is that this will be done
from a server on a WAN, not the local router/bridge.  

So I'm trying to figure out how to minimize the WAN portion of the ping.
Is it valid to also ping the router and subtract the difference?  I'm
wondering about the validity of this because 1) Network conditions
always change 2) Router's can be configured to respond to pings at a
very low priority.

Also, what's the best way to "ping" or detect latency/packet loss?  Is
it ping or is there a better tool?  What's the best tool to do this in
Perl.

Two Postfix servers that I take care of, both on Red Hat/Fedora, queue
up attempts at relaying through my servers. I would like Postfix to
simply discard e-mail not addressed to my domain, but it seems to try
to bounce these back to the sender, which of course are always forged.
I haven't been able to find the setting to change this by Googling. Any

I'd like to upgrade it to 3.0.1 using the Slackware package. Is anyone aware

   My assumption is that I'd need to install the package, not upgrade it, but

This message, while it seems to lack your domain, appears to be
addressed to you.  Postfix generally don't accept messages for domains
that it aren't part of $mydestination or $relay_domains, unless they come
from $mynetworks or through SMTP auth.  It's possible you've
mis-configured your server.  What does your
'smtpd_recipient_restrictions' look like, or better yet, your 'postconf
-n'?

Scott,

   I assume that in /etc/postfix/main.cf you have
local_recipient_maps = unix:passwd.byname $alias_maps

Is this correct?

   I see reports every day from pflogsumm that attempts to non-existant users
were rejected. Are you trying to discard them instead? I'd be inclined, in
the latter case, to ask for directions or guidance from the mailhelp list.

I'm not sure what the difference is between 'install' and 'upgrade' on
Slackware; on RPM it just means it permits installing replacement
files that would otherwise conflict.

BTW, make sure SA finds your Net::DNS working; mine didn't by default
(not sure why...), so I had to set 'dns_available yes' and it makes a
hell of a difference--the SURBLs (http://www.surbl.org/) really add
points.  (Now that I actually look at that site, I probably need to
update my Net::DNS...)  I also recommend installing DCC, Pyzor, Razor2,
Mail::SPF::Query and add a Postgrey greylisting server...

Of course, if you were using RHEL3 or a clone, I could point you at my
Yum repo... http://haus.nakedape.cc/ftp/nakedape/rhel3/

From the command line, 'fping' is a good tool for this sort of thing.
I would bet there are wrappers for it in Perl...

  That's a lot-o-interfaces (tm) to ping.  You're immediately going to have
a problem parallelizing the pings with most ping utilities.  I currently use
a home grown Cricket script to measure latency in my network.  Cricket sucks
at latency measurement because it's unable to parallelize the tasks.
Cricket will only latency check a few interfaces before it runs out of time.

  I'd recommend looking at Tobias Oetiker's "Smokeping" utility.  It already
has a lot of the capabilities you're looking for.  There are a number of
plugins which use telnet or rsh to ping from a remote host or router.  

http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/smokeping/

  If you're committed to rolling your own solution, look at "fping",
"echoping", and "curl".  Those utils will help you monitor almost anything
in your network.  The Smokeping plugins are a good example of how the utils
can be used.  There are also some perl modules that do the same things, but
I'll leave that to someone more monk'ish than me.

Wil,

When I run mailq, all of the messages queued show "svanhoosen" right
after the date, then shows the To: and From: addresses below. I'm not
sure it shows "svanhoosen" as, though that is my username, I'm "su -"

file.

smtpd_recipient_restrictions was commented out. Maybe that was the
problem... I'll tweak with it. Here is output from postconf -n:

I just went through my maillog and found some of the messages stuck in
my mailq. They are addressed to random nonexistant users in my domain.
Postfix seems to want to bounce replies back to the forged sender.
Sorry I didn't have this info in my original post. Anyway I would like
Postfix to stop trying to bounce these back to the sender, but is that
a bad idea because someone might misspell a real username?

That's why most of us reject mail addressed to unknown local users.
Leave the burden on the connecting mail server; if it's a virus or
spammer of some sort, no bounce will be generated.  If it's a legitimate
mail server, *it* will have the responsibility of generating a bounce.

Well, that's different than messages addressed to other domains.  Rich's
message has the solution to that; you'll need to add $virtual_maps and/or
$virtual_mailbox_maps.

Also, the svanhoosen is the sender of message in the queue because you set
'empty_address_recipient' to it; I'd recommend disabling that, I think.
I don't know what harm would actually come of it, but it looks odd.
(Of course make sure your aliases points MAILER-DAEMON at the right user;
the stock aliases file from Postfix does everything correctly if you just
set root's alias.)

You should take a look these Cisco IOS features - SAA and RTTMON. I
haven't had a chance to do much with them yet, but they are specifically
there for testing jitter, latency, and packet loss for VOIP networks.

All of my internet traffic goes through my Linksys WRT54G (running the
Ewrt 0.2-beta1-2.02.7 firmware). I would like to use it to find out how
much bandwidth I'm using with various ports and protocols throughout the
week. I did something with MRTG a year or two ago, but that wasn't with
the WRT.

I do have another box with some disk space that can receive data.

What are the options? Feel free to just give me some links or some
google keywords.

Thanks,

You can also open any calendar file with the calendar extension. No need

Subject: [PLUG] ssh tunnels
Message-ID: <20041112220150.GA9075@subtend.net>

I'm trying to understand the difference between these two SSH
commands, the end goal is to tunnel localport 2525 to a remote
server's 25 to allow me to relay mail out the server.

This doesn't work (but builds a tunnel just fine):
ssh -f -L 2525:host.dom:25 host.dom -N

This works great:
ssh -f _l 2525:host.dom:25 -N localhost

I'm trying to understand if localhost is an option for -N, or
if localhost is the destination of where I'm ssh'ing to (like a
normal ssh session).

The first one does give me the remote server's smtp banner when
I telnet to localhost:2525, but rejects due to relaying, the
second one allows relaying just fine.

I think your syntax on the second one might be off-- what did you really mean?

Your first one should have worked, though I usually write it as:

ssh -N -L 2525:localhost:25 host.dom

This means:

-N: don't run a command, just open the tunnel
-L 2525: open port 2525 on the system you're running ssh from
    localhost: connect the above port to this host from the host I'm
about to ssh into
    25: on this port
localhost: connect to this host and form the connection to the -L host from here

Most of the time the host you want in your tunnel option (-L/-R) is
"localhost" unless you're doing something really odd.

:) My whole scenario was foobar'd as my IP was allowed to relay
in this specific scenario.  In the end, after I removed my IP
from relaying, this works:

ssh -f -N -L 2525:localhost:25 host.dom

Some email sources aren't dns listed and you just have to accept them
explicitly.  It would be interesting if you could bypass just the helo
checking for certain helo names, but I don't know how to do that.

Go ahead and helo check.  I recommend what's called a relay 
firewall in front of your mail server.  Check out postfix.org 
for a config that only relays listed recipients.  I'm attaching
my own config.  Helo checking can block legitimate email.  I 
strongly suggest a script that checks the mail log on the relay
for messages to valid recipients that have been rejected using
the mail command to notify them.

I wrote such a script which emails the valid recipient with
the information about the rejection in case there needs
to be an exception for a certain message source.  Another option
I haven't played with much is a primary relay that helo
checks with a secondary that doesn't.  Better have a tertiary
set up as spamtrap for people who expect the secondary to be
more permissive and consistently go to it first incorrectly. 

All legitimate email servers are supposed to retry at least once.
Problems arise with sites that don't dns list their outgoing mail
servers such as AOL.  It may make their security easier, but it's
a pain for everyone else.

I've attached my main.cf for a postfix 2.1.1 gateway relay.
If you look carefully you'll notice sections for spf and
greylisting as well.  When you use greylisting it's an
especially good idea to have a notifictation script that
runs at least once a day so that your users can find out
about legitimate email attempts to them from sources that 
aren't greylisting compatible.

Your main source of course is postfix.org.

Another thing I've done is write another script that drops ip addresses
of abusers into an iptables chain.  I drop anyone who uses an invalid 
recipient name immediately dropping people who abuse smtp command
pipelining or come in with a hostname that's unknown for three days
after there have been three instances of abuse.

My rejection rate is hovering at 25% or so now down from 70-90%.
To stop bouncing use the luser relay feature.  The only problem with
this approach is that you have to do extra work to notify anyone
that should recieve a bounce there has been a problem.

Subject: [PLUG] httpd.conf question
Message-ID: <477eba8c04111216541891c49b@mail.gmail.com>

I'm pretty much a n00b when it comes to configuring apache.  I just
want to run a little web server on my linux machine here at work to
run some perl cgi stuff.  This is on a brand new Fedora Core 3
install.  Right now I can drop the script.cgi into /var/www/cgi-bin
and access it with this:

http://hostname/cgi-bin/script.cgi

That's fine and great, but it would be nice if someone could just type:

http://hostname

I've tried tweaking a couple things and nothing is getting me any
closer to that.  I renamed the script to index.cgi and tried just
going to http://hostname/cgi-bin to see if that was getting me closer,
but that didn't work.  Then I saw this <VirtualHost *> definition and
I added index.cgi to the DirectoryIndex directive in there.  Still no
dice.  I'm pretty much at a loss here, and can't justify spending too
much more of HP's time on this :-)  Can anyone help me out?

Thanks,

Bryan

The RedirectMatch directive is your friend:

   RedirectMatch permanent \
     ^/$ \
     http://hostname/cgi-bin/script.cgi

I'd have to play some with the regexes to include invocations of 
/index.htm[l] to work as well, but it'd end up looking something 
like this:

   Redirect Match permanent \
     ^/(index\.html?)?$ \
     http://hostname/cgi-bin/script.cgi

Paul's suggestion is good if you don't mind the actual URL being
/cgi-bin/script.cgi. If you want the CGI script to act as an index for a
directory, you'll need to do three things:

<Directory /the/place/where/the/cgi/is>
  # This is generally on anyway, but turn it on to be safe
  Options +Indexes 

  # Make files ending in cgi and pl act as CGI scripts in this
  # directory.
  # (/cgi-bin/ uses the different ScriptAlias directive)
  AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl

  # Make index.cgi the index file. You can add other filenames here
  # as well.
  DirectoryIndex index.cgi
</Directory>

If you apply these directives to your DocumentRoot (or use 
<Location /> instead of <Directory ...>), you can put index.cgi in your
DocumentRoot and access it with http://hostname.

AddHandler is discussed here:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_mime.html#addhandler

And DirectoryIndex here:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_dir.html#directoryindex

This sounds like a job for tcptraceroute, it will keep track of times
between hops, and you can use any tcp port that the router will respond
to.

Good Luck,

Have you tried the EWRT mailling list?  

SNMP isn't available yet, so you'll need to set up your iptables rules to 
do logging on all accepted packets and then analyze the logs to get what
you're asking for.  (I think.)

It was reinstalled clean, Mac OSX 10.3 was put back on with a complete
reformat.

If you unplug the ethernet cable for five seconds and then do arp -a
in a terminal, multicast addresses come up.  224.0.0.yyy.  Is the
firmware compromised or is this normal behavior that can be turned
off somewhere?  Watching a tcpdump the laptop tries to broadcast
it's private ip address to 0.0.0.0.  

On a standup G4 running the same OS, unplugging the ethernet cable 
doesn't have the same effect.  Multicast addresses don't pop up.

This is indeed weird.

Hi all,

Yum 2.0.5 with FC3 requires a 'repodata' subdirectory in the yum
repository instead of or in addition to the 'headers' subdirectory.

I've searched all over and I can't find any information on how to
generated the repodata subdirectory. The yum-arch utility doesn't do
it. It just makes the headers directory. Anyone figured this out
yet?

Thanks,

Correction. That's yum 2.1.11 that comes with FC3.

createrepo is the application you want. A discussion of the drive 
behind the change to repodata is online at Duke:

You can get createrepo from a number of rpm repositories, or you can 
go to the source:

LTSP is worth the trouble if you want to have a bunch of diskless thin
clients.  Then it works really well.

For your situation, you'd probably want to set up the second computer
with a basic local Linux install, with X.  Then (I think) have the
machine's display manager (XDM, GDM, KDM, etc.) connect to the server
box instead of localhost.

Don't forget to allow remote connections to the thin client's X server.

Have fun,

Thanks. Knowing what to look for I found an RPM for createrepo

That sounds complicated. I just set the display manager (I've only used
GDM) to accept XDMCP requests and then run this on the client:

$ X -query the-server

This is using the regular notion of server/client, not X's notion.

You can put that in /etc/inittab to do it on boot and always restart
when killed.

Subject: [PLUG] soundcard annoyance
Message-ID: <BAY20-F38maLG9MODbA000492ef@hotmail.com>


Hi:

I have a box that I upgraded to Fedora 2 (kernel 2.6.8) earlier
this summer.  I noticed after I upgraded that my soundcard
won't work until I run a tool from the gnome menu
that detects soundcard by playing a sound.  And then my audio would work 
fine.
I did not play much attention to it since I seldom  need the sound function
on this box.

This weekend, I upgraded another box to Fedora 3 (kernel 2.6.9) and
notice the exact same problem.  No sound until I
run that soundcard detection tool from the menu (which is a python script).

Running "alsactl restore" from the command line seems
to help (so I put his line in /etc/rc.d/rc.local) but not always reliable.
The most reliable mechanism is still running that soundcard detection tool 
under
my menu.

lspci detects the right sound card on both boxes.

/etc/modprobe.conf has a bunch of lines that
seems to relate to setting up the sound card.  But evidently,
it isn't working very well.

I want to set up a dns server to lie about certain domain 
names I don't want to permit accurate lookups for.  If a 
local host asks for some.blockeddomain.com, I want to 
give an answer that points at a local server.

I don't want to go the squid route because squid doesn't 
work with all web sites.  

I could pursue bypassing squid for certain sites, but I'd 
like to avoid going there.  I want to permit direct proxy 
free Internet access except for a number of specific 
sites.  I doubt I can keep attempts to connect directly 
to an ip address from working without setting up a 
transparent proxy and dansguardian, but I'm not too 
worried about that.

Let's say I want bananna.org to map to 10.0.0.2 even though 
I am not the authoritative dns server for banana.org.  I'd 
like to be able to acheive something with my own internal
robinson-west.com name server similar to:

bananna.org.	A	10.0.0.2

What I'm after here is you can try to look up bananna.org,
but the nameserver for bananna.org will never be queried 
and my local nameserver will resolve your query to 10.0.0.2.  
At 10.0.0.2 I put up a webserver that says, "you're attempt 
to go to bananna.org was denied."  I don't want to break 
all foreign sites.  Even though bananna.org doesn't resolve 
correctly, ebay.com etc. still should.  Instead of just 
iptables blocking certain ip addresses, I want to
avoid the problem of hanging people's web browsers.



What I'm after can be done with /etc/hosts in this way:

10.0.0.2	bananna.org

I don't want an ugly /etc/hosts file though and this 
doesn't affect workstations that use the dns.



The main  reason I'm looking for a don't look it up 
solution is that I do upwards of a 1000 host lookups 
as it is to block certain web sites using iptables.  
Web sites can ip fluctuate, especially if they are 
set up on a dial-up line or a random ip in a large 
netblock.  

One reason I don't want to look offensive sites up 
is that this may suggest interest in offensive 
materials and send the following incorrect message 
out, "here I am, please spam me."

Well... I've been running entirely through squid for the last two and a
half years and have only had one instance of it not working correctly;
it was a Windows Update bug.  *Every* other website has worked fine...

AFAIK, the only way to accomplish this with bind is to have entries in
named.conf for each domain you wish to block.

A transparent squid proxy is really more effective, though... it can
block IPs and hostnames.  If you simply block dns resolution, the user
could easily look up the IP online and browse directly to that....

You're better with squid then I am then.  Have you been forced 
to add exceptions to squid for certain sites?  I can't get my.pcc.edu
to work through squid for example and I hear that myfamily.com has
problems too.  Is there special patching to squid that has to be done
for secure web pages, etc.?  If there's a way to get practically any
site to work through squid, that would be better because it would 
allow the use of clamav against all incoming content.

I can't get windowsupdate to work through squid.  For obvious reasons,
it would nice to force content from windowsupdate.com through antivirus
prior to letting these updates install on a workstation.  I don't think
ports 80 and 443 are the only tcp/udp ports that have to be open for
windowsupdate.com to work.  I'm so frustrated with not being able to run
windowsupdate.com through a filtered proxy that I've almost said no
Windows machines on the Internet.  The only Windows system I can get
my users to agree with me on for that policy is Windows XP.  I don't
know that you can get myfamily.com to work without Windows 98 or 2000
and Internet Explorer.  Probably the smartest thing a person could
do is have the Windows installed to a ram drive and run that system
so that there's no concern about booting a virused Windows machine. 
This might be accomplished by replacing the Windows entirely before 
each session from a known good copy and using a protected 
(non flash) bios.  It's surprising the latter isn't standard on
new computers, even a switch or jumper to disable bios upgrades
isn't standard.  Would it be that hard to have a power, reset, 
and bios upgrade switch?  I'd turn that third switch off when
I'm online.  

Another option is running the web browser chroot, but I believe that
only Mac OSX 10.3, Linux, and other Unix systems support this.  It 
would be nice to have a howto on how to make users use mozilla in a
chroot sandbox built in their home directory.  I'm also curios about
forcing deletion of all cached content in mozilla when any user exits it
under Linux.  How do you allow changing to the skypilot theme without
allowing cached content to persist across multiple instantiations
of mozilla?  I'd probably need to teach people to save their bookmarks
to a persistent location.  I'm more concerned there may be important
cookies and that it may not be clear what's in them.  Usually you
want to dump all of your cookies, but with sites like myfamily.com
this can prove to be a real nuisance policy.  What I'm tryhing to get
away from via chroot is the web browser being a vulnerability to the
underlying operating system.

How do/did you have Squid set up?  As a transparent proxy?  As far as I
know, you can't transparently proxy HTTPS sites.  I don't fully
understand why, but I have had no luck with them.  Generally speaking,
there's no need to keep people away from HTTPS sites, though.  If it is
an issue, you can simply block HTTPS and require users to run HTTPS
through your proxy manually.

I haven't had any issues accessing PCC sites and myfamily.com popped
right up just now.

How were you filtering?  WindowsUpdate will be filtered from working if
you disable the download of executable files.  It's hard to say exactly
what the issue might be, however, without knowing what you're using to
do the actual filtering.  And *are* you using Squid transparently?  It
also might be nice to see parts of your squid.conf file.

Are there any guidelines that I should follow using whois such as

Has anyone ever heard of network administrators at U of P or faculty
there intentionally hacking the computers of students?  I've heard
this might be done to improve security and impart valuable lessons
to those students who are in the engineering programs.  I suppose
it's just as likely that this is the work of a random hacker, but
I'm certainly curious.  The implications for not only plugging
in at U of P but perhaps other Universities as well could be 
enormous.

Does anyone know of a $25 easily transported hardware firewall that
can go between a potentially vulnerable laptop or computer and
a University's network?  This would ideally be a cube no thicker
than 4 leather wallets stacked with an ethernet port for the
student's laptop and another ethernet port for the University's 
network.  If such a product isn't commonly available, it might
be worth going into business to make one.  I'd rather see a $25
hardware firewall hacked instead of seeing my $1k+ computer taken
out.  I can buy a lot of $25 computers before I'm up to the cost
of replacing one $1k+ computer.

How about a small router. It may cost in the $30's or $40's, but the size is 
right. Kind of a nuisance to have to plug in the power, though. I agree with 
you about that sort of thing being a good idea for a product. Maybe if it 
were a USB device, you wouldn't have to worry about the power.

Why is a separate hardware firewall for a single machine better than a
software firewall on that single machine? Don't they both block packets as
instructed? Is there something inherently unsafe about using a software
firewall?

Yes, unfortunately this is a growing issue across the U.S. at quite a
few universities.  This has been covered in the news in several campus
newspapers (some students were skilled enough to figure out what was
going on), but unfortunately it hasn't received any mainstream media
attention yet.  Basically it goes like this...  Engineering students
are being targeted by their instructors to "teach them a lesson" about
computer security they'll never forget.  If these students are going
to be designing the systems of tomorrow then they had better damn well
understand computer security, for the sake of us all.

Usually it progresses in 3 phases.  The first phase is just access to
the student's computer and the deletion of a few harmless files or
other activities that make the system perform strangely (this may have
happened to you already).  If the student still hasn't properly
secured their computer then phase two is implemented.  Phase 2
involves the installation of programs designed to make the use of the
computer frustrating to use - constant popups, false virus warnings,
random program crashes, etc.  Phase 2 will often times involve the
installation of a root kit for attacking other students' systems and
to hide the instructor's origin.  Phase 3 wipes the filesystem of all
data.

These university instructors are excellent hackers and they not only
know the university's systems inside and out, they are usually
specialists in a particular OS and often work in teams against more
challenging targets.
Your idea of a 4-leather-wallet-high firewall is a good one, but that
might not even be enough.  These university instructors can be
ruthless.  You might need 2 or even 3 firewalls just to be on the safe
side.
Good luck!

There appears to be a serious security flaw in the G4 iBook.  It could
be that Mac OS 9 is totally insecure, my brother's iBook was running
OS/9 when the virus hit.  A hardware firewall/filter proxy cube might
protect you if you don't have your latop or desktop firewall configured 
correctly.  The virus that hit my brother's laptop turned it 
into a multicast broadcaster to who knows here.  This
virus got past his antiviral software and it survived a zero fill
reformatting of the hard drive.  It must be in the bios of the
computer.  Short of being able to pull and reprogram or replace 
the bios chip, there's no way I can see to get rid of this virus. 
That's assuming there isn't a bug in Mac OSX 10.3's format program 
that is allowing the virus to survive the format operation.

Why apple and other computer manufacturers don't offer a 
physical bios upgrade prevention switch or jumper block
I can't tell you.  Computers that have no backup to their
flash bioses can be rendered useless by viruses.  It used to
be that you'd pull the bios chip out of a socket and buy
a replacement.  Many bioses now are surface mount
flash chips, so there's no easy fix.  Surface mount flash
with no protective jumpers may be cheaper to manufacture,
but this cost cutting measure sucks from a security 
standpoint.

If there's something wrong with the tcp/ip stack on the G4 iBook,
a firewall cube set up properly could protect against hackers
trying to take advantage of this weakness.

Can you replace the G4 iBook's boot code without OS/9?
Can the bios chip be removed and replaced?

My brother had ipfw configured.  I don't know if his firewall 
was up when the virus hit.  Apparently it came in through
Safari.  He believes that the virus gets around ipfw 
considering that he has rules denying multicast packets
and his laptop does multicasting to who knows where.
Assuming ipfw on his iBook doesn't work because of a flaw somewhere,
a hardware firewall could indeed be better than the supplied
software one.  This virus eats data files, so his laptop is 
worthless unless it can be cleaned.

Anyone who has an iBook that doesn't want it rendered useless, get
OS/9 off of it ASAP.  Don't have OS/9 installed unless you're 
offline and need to upgrade your bios.  Personally I'd dump
OSX 10.3 and replace it with Mk-Linux, OSX-10.3 obviosuly has
serious security flaws.

In general, it's less safe to use the firewall on the PC which also
has to do other stuff than a dedicated firewall. The reason primarily
has to do with the necessary access. If a PC runs more than a
firewall, it has to allow some access (unless the "other stuff" has
nothing to do with networking). Access means potential exploits. If
you browse web from your firewall, the browser could have exploits,
root escalation may be possible, then the firewall can be disabled.
Same idea for web server, nameserver, etc. If the firewall is
dedicated, you could disable all forms of remote access if you wanted,
or restrict them as much as you want.
In practice, the difference targets a fairly narrow range of attacks:
most attackers are not skilled enough to break either firewall, of
those who are most will break any firewall if they really want to, so
with a dedicated firewall you're protecting yourself from those of
"medium" skill, or those of "high" skill who will take one look and
decide that cracking your firewall takes more than 10 seconds and
you're not worth the hassle, and move to the next target.

What happens if the student installs a locked down
openbsd system, or better still, a selinix system
that is similarly locked down?

Any University that does this sort of thing better have one heck of a
good lawyer. OTOH scanning and disconnecting access for someone with an
insecure machine is more than likely to happen.

I've got some oceanside land in Arizona I'd like to sell you. Provide
references before I can no longer stiffle my laughter.

Most Universities do have good network access. This does lead to greater
exposure, and quite likely the kiddies will be all over you quickly if
you've got a really insecure machine. Those folks will happily toast you
without having a good lawyer.

Software is infinitely more flexible than hardware. _Well_ written
firewall software will clobber hardware any day. All of the "hardware"
firewalls are simply hardware designed to assist firewall software
anyway. Having it in a separate box simply means that you've got firewall
in a separate box, any of the free Unicies will do a firewalling job
equivalent to these "hardware firewalls" easily. If you're on EvilOS
though you don't have any options.

Please call it by its proper name "firmware". Did this system have all
the current patches installed? If the system isn't configured corectly
you're already dead no matter what you're doing. Though I've been waiting
for a virus to each flash chips I've yet to see any reports of such a
beast.

Well, if it isn't up, it isn't worth much now is it? Preventing such
packets coming in, doesn't prevent you from sending them out. Perhaps
this is a virus of the common type called "hardware failure"? These virii
appear to accumulate on old hardware eventually rendering it completely
useless (completely dead), no one has tracked down who originally created
these, but it appears the manufacturers try to encourage their spread in
order to get people to "upgrade" their computers. Apparently there is a
special firewall called a "warrenty" that stops these from spreading.

I'm thinking a whole rack of 1-RU firewalls might do the trick. You'd
want to have it on wheels, so you could roll it around to your different
classes, to the lab, etc.

Oh, and give them wireless access too! Then you can be sitting out on
the commons, surfing the Internet in safety. In that case, you'd need a
seperate cart to hold all the batteries to power that
rack-of-safety(tm).

Try running "yum -y update" instead after adding the following lines
to your yum.conf:

[base]
name=Fedora Core $releasever - $basearch - Base
baseurl=http://limestone.uoregon.edu/ftp/fedora/3/i386/os/

[updates-released]

If your rpm database is ok try running "yum check-update". It should 
give you a list of packages. Also if yum works you can us it to update 
your system.

I worked out of a similar situation by "rpm -qaV > list" and then 
loading packages to resolve dependencies and missing files. It was a lot 
of work - but it worked.

Requirement 1 and 2 mean you'll be wanting a fair amount of RAM
available.  Requirement 3 also requires lots of RAM, but generally
also means you want a DVD writer.  If you need to do any real-time
compression then you also end up needing a fast CPU and hard drive. 
DV-based digital video requires Firewire.

Did I miss any components?  ;-)

SUSE is fairly compatible with all major laptops.  Major compatibility
problems seem to be pretty rare these days.  However, component
compatiblity seems very common-- particularly built-ins like modems,
Ethernet, Firewire, and wireless adapters.

Once you narrow the field a bit, head over to:

http://www.linux-laptop.net/

Here you can see what works and what doesn't.

SUSE also has a good database of compatible systems:

http://www.suse.com/en/business/certifications/certified_hardware/notebook.html

I would suggest from my experience with laptops that you look at:
  1) Lots of RAM, buy more than you need (1GB, 2GB if you can)
  2) CPU speed is not particularly important.  Faster CPU == shorter
battery and hotter lap
  3) Hard drive speed is going to suck compared with desktops
  4) Long battery life under high CPU load (divide the "rating" by 2
to get something realistic)
  5) Get one that's been out for 6 months or so for better driver support
  6) Check that the Firewire port works on Linux

I've had good luck with both Dell and IBM laptops.  (Others have
reported Dell horror stories, but when mine have broken Dell has been
excellent about getting them fixed.)

Minor modifactions to the above since this is an amd64 box, but that
seems to have solved my problem.  After the yum update (I ran it a
couple times to be sure) I rebooted for good measure and everything
came up, even the happy blueish checkmark from the up2date icon (which
I will never click again!).  The only weird thing is firefox won't
run, and prints nothing on the command line, it just immediately
returns my command line.  I probably need to go download the latest
from mozilla.org anyway, right?

All,

The network here consists of several Linux servers on a LAN. I would

other systems can create an ssl pairing. The effect would be only the

Alternatively is there a policy that can perform this way?

Yes. Sorry for the delay, I was trying to remember the name of a store 
that carried it (some audiophile store near the Aladdin Theater). 
Anyways, local.google.com for portland, query: "taiyo yuden" yields 
three stores, the first two look like what you want.

This is off topic, but ...

I have a relative in the Sherwood area with 1 to 3 computers that 
don't seem to be working.  I'm not surprised.  They run Windows.  
>From the conversation I had with my relatives, I strongly suspect 
that the only thing wrong with these computers is a combination of 
viruses, spyware, and other common Windows infestations.

Could someone recommend a trust worthy person in the western suburbs who 
can go in and fix these problems or else a good computer shop where my
relatives could take the machines?

David,

   I've had work done on portables at Northwest Computer Support in SW
Beaverton. They also work on desktop units. Not quite as far southwest as
Sherwood, but it's one I know and can recommend.

   In the meantime, have them get some of the leftover heavy-duty plastic and
duct tape from John Ashcroft. Completely wrap each infected system in
plastic and seal with duct tape.

HTH,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] Procmail quits sorting after a while...
Message-ID: <419A5560.2080506@dimstar.net>

OK, here's a procmail problem that comes up with my system every month. 
Monthly, I have a cron job that archives my sorted mail folders. After 
that happens, everything works swimmingly... until sometime in the 
middle of the month. Then procmail doesn't sort certain emails that it 
sorted previously. It only stops sorting some of the mail. It continues 
to sort most of my mail properly. Is there a file size it can't write to?

For instance, on the 15th, it properly sorted this:

 From root at dimstar.net  Mon Nov 15 04:02:09 2004
 Subject: mckinley.dimstar.net 11/15/04:04.02 system check
  Folder: IN.admin                                                      
2770453

And then on the 16th, it took the nightly report and put it in my inbox:

 From root at dimstar.net  Tue Nov 16 04:02:11 2004
 Subject: mckinley.dimstar.net 11/16/04:04.02 system check
  Folder: /var/spool/mail/russj                                         
3741585

The rule I have to do this is:

# Root Mail
:0:
* ^From:.*root at .*dimstar\.net
IN.admin

Any ideas?

Russ

   I've just gone through everyone I know, and those who might know someone
in internal medicine or infectious diseases. Came up blank. It's frustrating
to not be able to provide help when it's needed by someone like Pat.

Thanks for the word,

If you or they want to do it themselves, Spybot is a free download
that seems to do a really good job of cleaning up spyware and such.

OK, I found it... after searching google for awhile.

mailbox_size_limit = 51200000

That's the default for postfix, and it must transfer this limit to 
procmail, since procmail is delivering.

I'm testing right now, but according to the debian mailing list, this is 
the issue.

I think it was on this list that I first came across the alternatives
command (RHL/FC/RHEL) and was it neat.  Now I've build a new server
(actually 6) that is (are) using postfix (installed using yum and the
repository at ftp.WL0.org) but alternatives --config mta only shows
sendmail.  Not too much of a problem but several of the postfix
support-type commands don't work (or not correctly any way).  Is there a
hand method to get the postfix alternative installed?  My assumption is
the rpm I got didn't do the things it needed to do to make this work.

As usual pointers or clue-sticks are appreciated.


TIA,
Rod

I realize a firewall isn't worth beans if it isn't up, the interesting
thing even though there were rules to block outbound multicasts is that
those rules didn't work.

This isn't old hardware, it's a practically brand new G4 powerbook. 
Shame on CompUSA for not updating the patches when they upgraded 
the hard drive if that is in fact why the laptop failed.  It could be
hardware failure, that's why the laptop was taken away from my brother 
and run over to the shop.  My brother is an EE who feels he 
can fix any computer, but we weren't getting what we really needed
from google and you don't blow $12k over a $1k laptop anyways. 

The biggest problem I see is that protecting the firmware is an
afterthought. It's useless to have a "good OS" if you don't protect
the hardware foundations it runs on.  It's arrogant to say that the
firmware in Apple iBooks doesn't get hacked, arrogant and stupid.

This iBook without some kind of firmware protection is too easily 
hacked. Linux is the only system that appears to work correctly on 
it if it can't be fixed.  We did a test with a ppc gentoo minimal
disk and found it wasn't broadcasting those strange packets that it
does when you're running MacOSX.  Schools use dangerous software like
adobe acrobat, powerpoint, and MS-Word.  How are you supposed to look 
at files from these programs if these files can not only virus, but in
some cases completely destroy your computer?  If you can simulate a
computer and protect the underlying hardware, that might not be so bad.

Whoever thinks that MacOSX is more secure than Linux is full of it.

Hopefully, any flaw is a faulty part and not a design mistake on the
part of the makers of iBook.  You would think that these machines would
get tested at the store before they're sold though.

I sure hope that CompUSA can figure out what went wrong and come up with
an affective prevention method that doesn't bar connecting to networks.

I wonder what the probability is that the MacOSX install disk itself is
hacked?

Thanks for the heads up.  I've been using limestone as a rsync source. 
Didn't know it is a yum repository.

If you are using the third-party package of postfix, I bet it didn't run 
the right scripts when it installed.  My FC3 postfix package runs 
alternatives as part of its post-install scripts.  This might do the job 
(be careful with word-wrap).

/usr/sbin/alternatives --install /usr/sbin/sendmail mta 
/usr/sbin/sendmail.postfix 30 \
         --slave /usr/bin/mailq mta-mailq /usr/bin/mailq.postfix \
         --slave /usr/bin/newaliases mta-newaliases

Subject: [PLUG] Lyx: Two figures side-by-side?
Message-ID: <1100674430.7554.11.camel@timmy>

I have a bunch of graphs I need to put in my paper. They only need to be
half a page wide, so to save space I would like to put them in a
2-column grid (side-by-side). My googling turned up this tip:

http://www.devel.lyx.org/~rae/www-user/help/floats/floats.html#fside

The subfigure trick *almost* does it, but it doesn't create two separate
figures and the captions appear under the graphic, not above like every
other figure.

How can I simply make two figure floats appear on the same line?

Thanks!

Why don't you provide more information about these "strange packets",
then we might be able to comment? Perhaps these are merely packets for
a legitimate application you're not familiar with.

Far more likely you're being hit by something known which has had a patch
available for weeks. You've said nothing about being up to date on
patches. No matter which OS you use, if you're behind on patches, you're
toast.

Well as I stated previously, yes the danger is there, but no so far no
one is known to of successfully written a virus which corrupts Apple
firmware. I note that x86 motherboards have also shipped with firmware
writable for quite some time, they're more common and they haven't been
hit yet.

This is certainly inviting disaster, but still, so far no one is known to
of even attempted it. Certainly writing to the firmware should be well
within the capabilities of many people out there (comment on most virus
writers, they're not very capable). Making it so that the machine remains
functional after modifying the firmware, and spreads the virus would be a
pretty massive undertaking. Note this sentence, once such a virus is
released, the most likely symptom is the machine becoming completely
unusable on reboot. It is highly unlikely that a machine hit by such a
virus would remain useful for too long.

There have not been ANY verified reports of virii which overwrite
firmware deliberatly for any system (expecting it to happen, but nothing
yet). It is highly unlikely your system was hit by something that hasn't
even been rumored to exist ANYWHERE. Heck with the prevalence of CD/DVD
writers autorun has been a wonderful target for a virus, yet there
haven't been any serious ones.

> Whoever thinks that MacOSX is more secure than Linux is full of it.

Yes, but that is a pretty high standard to compare to. A more useful
comparison would be "a little worse than Linux", "a lot worse than
Linux", "a little better than Windows", or "worse than Windows".

Thanks Ian.

I found post-install in the /etc/postfix directory and figured this was 
what should be done but a look at the contents made me think it needed to 
be called from another script that set several enviornment variables.

Based on the code below I'll look at it again with brighter eyes.  Do you
know if the admin portion of alternatives is described somewhere -- on
system or off?

  --Alliance Publishes ATM Cyber Security Guide
(10 November 2004)
The Global ATM Security Alliance has published a guide to cash machine
cyber security as a proactive measure; ATMs are increasingly moving to
Windows and other commonly used platforms.  Though ATMs are generally
on private networks or VPNs, the possibility of undocumented Internet
connections always exists, as does the possibility of malicious code
sneaking in via laptops connected to the system.  Last year, the Nachi
worm exploited the RPC DCOM vulnerability in Windows to compromise ATMs
at two different financial institutions.

I don't know about you, but the idea that my bank account(s) can be
reached from an ATM network based on Windows makes me woozy.

Subject: [PLUG] Securing tripwire/aide databases
Message-ID: <419B8CE3.4080602@ahapala.net>

I've used tripwire in the past and am using aide at the moment. Both of 
these programs recommend putting their databases on read-only media so 
that it can't be tampered with. I am currently putting my aide database 
on a floppy and leaving it mounted RO.

Two of my machines are remote and in doing updates to them I obviously 
create changes which aide dutifully reports. Since the db's are stored 
on the floppies I have to go on site to eject them, flip the tab, write 
the new db, flip the tab and remount RO. I'd like to find a remote 
solution where I can update the databases and still keep their integrity.

My first thought was to keep the databases on my server and then write a 
wrapper script to retrieve the db via ssh. It wasn't very hard for me to 
create a user on my server, exchange a pass phrase-less key and have the 
script retrieve the db. However, there isn't anything to prevent the 
uploading of a new db. I couldn't find that one can restrict an ssh key 
to be read only. I guess the ideal would be to have one key read 
only(without a passphrase) and another key that would require a typed 
password that would have read write ability on my server to upload the 
new db.

I suppose I could set up some sort of read-only ftp point on my server 
and then use ssh to upload the new db when needed.

So, any thoughts, gurus?

Thanks,
Keith

In this situation, I think the best you can do is to keep a copy of the 
database off system. Then, if you suspect tampering, you can compare the 
off-site and on-site databases.

The other problem you might run into is modified binaries. How would you 
verify them? You would have to have a trusted system, somewhere to 
verify these things. So, if you trust your workstation, keeping the 
database there would be reasonable. Having your tripwire like substance 
check the binaries and periodically checking your databases would be 
reasonable.

I'm confused by what you mean. By modified binaries do you mean of the 
integrity checker? Or do you mean other system binaries (ls, ps, top, 
etc)? If it is the latter then isn't that what the integrity checker is 
for? I've used the debian tool debsums and rpm --verify to check the 
binaries against the package installed versions. I also store a few 
important binaries on the floppies as well (ls, ps, netstat, etc).

I'm also going to look into samhain[1], which does both integrity 
checking and some level of intrusion detection as well. Apparently it 
can log to a central server which might be beneficial in my case.

Anyone have good/bad experiences with samhain?

I'm talking about the binaries that do the checking. /usr/sbin/tripwire 
or /usr/sbin/aide, etc.

Tripwire recommends that you keep copies of the database and binaries 
off system, on read only media, to check the system if compromise is 
suspected.

I did some more searching and came up with this:

http://www.mail-archive.com/lyx-users at lists.lyx.org/msg33496.html

        My way of doing this is:
        Insert a figure float. Go inside, set the paragraph type to
        "satandard" instead of the default "caption" Insert two
        minipages inside the float
        (insert->minipage) with a hfill (insert->special->hfill) between
        them.
        Set each minipage to 50% of COL or less.
        In each minipage, include graphichs (insert->graphichs) Center
        the graphichs using layout->pragraph.
        Press enter after each graphich, to get a new paragraph. Set the
        paragraph type to caption, and enter caption text.
        
        Helge Hafting
        
Works for me!

There's a caption for each graphic (I put it above) and each appears as

Subject: [PLUG] Need Help Printing From VMware Guest OS
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0411180934120.9195@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've asked for help on the VMware community forum for workstations, but
have not found a solution there. The one fellow who has responded keeps
asking me to do Microsoft-ish things (like disconnecting the USB device for
a networked printer) and I really need a solution to the conundrum.

   The problem, very briefly, is that I can no longer print from my one
winduhs application to the HP 2500C inkjet printer. Nor can I send a test
page from within the virtual win98se's control panel -> printers -> 2500C ->
print a test page. However, I can print a test page from within the HP 2500C
toolkit that's installed along with the driver. Printing to the laser works
just fine.

   On the former workstation (running Red Hat 7.3 with the two printers
directly connected and the inkjet on /dev/lp1) it worked for years. This is
with VMware Workstation-4.5.2. I just replaced the "old" win98 driver
(August 1999) with a "new" win98 driver (December 1999). Big hassle; no
difference. Now, I'm running on Slackware 10.0 with both printers as network
nodes with their JetDirect cards. They work just fine with linux.

   Since I can print a test page to the 2500C from the HP toolkit, the
driver, logical connection and physical connection all work. What I cannot
understand is why I cannot print a test page from the winduhs control panel
nor can I print from my application. There are no error messages. Everybody
reports that the job was pushed down the wire to the printer. Nothing shows
up in the virtual win98 print queue for that printer, nothing shows up in
the CUPS print spool and nothing shows up at the printer.

   I know less than nothing about Windows so I have no idea what to poke,
prod or otherwise jiggle to get this working again. Your assistance will be
greatly appreciated.

TIA,

Rich

amavis whitelisting always seems broken. Currently, I think it was 
fixed. update, and try again :)
Also, there's like 3 ways to create a whitelist. Amavis-users list has 
more info.

Tell the sender to use ntp, and the problem will go away, btw. :)

   Germane to the other reply posted on this thread, if you have postfix UCE
files (e.g., for IP addresses, domain names, header and body checks), put
that sender or domain at the top with and OK as the action.

   For example, in my /etc/postfix/badaddr file I have at the very top:

azzurri.jp                              OK 
moongroup.com                           OK 
eugenesand.com                          OK
greatbasin.net                          OK
nevadamining.org                        OK
gisnet.com                              OK

   They are passed through without hassle. I've never had any of these
tickled by spamassassin so I don't know if this is applicable to your
situation. Hope it helps, though.

I hope you can come up with a ride, but if not, Tri-Met does go there. Plug 
your address into the form on this page:

http://www.trimet.org/

and also plug in:  9727 SW Terwilliger Blvd

From their map, it looks like there are two bus routes that go by the school, 
38 and 39.

Thanks!

BTW, I just got cardbus working on my AMD64 laptop.  The kernel patch
worked fine.  Took a bit or hackery to get the madwifi drivers to
compile.  (The instructions are not very clear on crosscompiling, which
is what it takes to build for some reason.)

So far the card is very fast.  I have not tested to see if that also
fixes the memory card reader.

Anyone heard of mDNS or rendevous addresses?  That's what those
multicasts were all about.  Strangely when my brother bought an
identical ibook and compared it with his old one, the ttl on the
multicast packets were quite different.  On the old ibook the ttl 
is 255 whereas the ttl on the new iBook is just 1, the packet 
will stay in a local network.  He says he is learning about forth
and should be able to compare the firmware in both the new
machine and the old.

I thought apple was supposed to turn everything off by default following
the philosophy that what the user doesn't know about is dangerous to
that user.  I don't understand why these multicasts bypassed an ipfw
firewall set to all inbound and all outbound packets blocked.    
There are security problems that crop up when you don't need a server.  
This zeroconf networking idea is an interesting one, but I myself 
don't trust multicast dns yet and I consider this incident suggestive 
that Apple may be moving too fast.  

It's cool to see multicast for the first time.  Technically broadcast
addresses are a subset of multicast addresses, but that's different
than seeing an ip address of 224.0.0.253 when you're running tcpdump.

http://www.zeroconf.org
http://www.multicast.org

See informational sites at www.apple.com.  Multicast dns has been a
part of Mac OSX since version 10.2.

Alas, the 38 is a commuter bus, so it doesn't run on weekends.  The 39 is

Tell windows to show you hidden and system files.

Samba knows that those are hidden files, so it sets the hidden bit when 
serving them to Windows.

In MY COMPUTER, go to TOOLS>FOLDER OPTIONS. Look on the VIEW tab.

Or you can just add "hide dot files = no" to your smb.conf file.

Hey list-

A group of us got together and are going to generate Slackware security
updates while Pat is out of action.  Our goal is to maintain 8.1, 9.0,
9.1, 10.0, and -current.  Right now, we're just about caught up with
10.0.

The website is http://slacksec.info/

Also, if anybody is interested in mirroring the packages, drop us an
email (slacksec at slacksec.info).  We currently have two European mirrors,
not a single one on this side of the pond.  We're not expecting to every
require more than 2GB of disk space and offer access to the packages for
mirrors via rsync.  We're less than a week old now and are currently
eating 1GB/day on the primary website.

Even worse on the digest list. Got the "This is way cool.", but never
knew there originally was an attachment at all. Somehow I didn't think
you'd think the ability to post to the PLUG lists or the existance of
the Port of Portland would be "way cool".

   Actually, since two of the three container lines are pulling out, the
employees of the Port probably think its existance is "way cool". The
remaining employees, of course.

I'd guess that GPM is confused about how many buttons the trackball
has.  What happens if you paste using the right, middle or left+right
buttons?

It would be helpful if you said what kind of trackball it is and what
mouse type GPM is configured for.  (Do a cat /etc/gpm.conf)

Subject: [PLUG] Exciting Fedora 3 Update
Message-ID: <1101018953.3723.19.camel@apollo.spears.org>

Today I updated from Fedora 2 to Fedora 3; it seemed to work until I
booted. It got to Grub, got to the temporary login prompt, and promptly
went to black. Totally black, totally hung.  I  repeated this
fascinating experience several times just to be sure it actually
happened.

Fortunately, the update comes with a rescue disk, maybe they know
something.  Looking at /var/log/messages, I saw that it looked like gdm
was at fault.  I changed inittab and booted into runlevel 3 just fine.
Phew!

X had been working perfectly before so I don't know what could have
happened.  When I ran Xorg -configure it told it couldn't detect my
mouse and that I should fix that section. I tried 
Xorg -config /etc/X11/xorg.conf and it didn't hang, so I tried startx
and  it worked, so I guess there was nothing wrong with X, although I
don't know why Xorg -configure didn't work(system-config-display) also
hung.

Does anyone what changed in FC3 to mess up gdm?

Another thing that might work is to hold down the shift key when you do
both the highlight and the paste operations.

Good Luck,

I haven't had any issues with FC3, but I always switch to kdm (gdm
gave me too many problems in the past) by adding the following two
lines to /etc/sysconfig/desktop:

DESKTOP="KDE"
DISPLAYMANAGER="KDE"

Aaron,

   It used to mark with the left button and paste with the right button. I've
tried right and both to no avail. In a xterm, shift-left copies to the mouse
buffer and shift-both pastes from it.

   No gpm.conf here. It's a Kensington Orbit two-button trackball and in
/etc/rc.d/rc.gpm it's defined as
   /usr/sbin/gpm -m /dev/mouse -t imps2

The regular, ps2 did not work.

Bill,

   I no longer run distributions named after hats, but I had a similar
experience -- twice -- when I upgraded from X.org-6.7.0 to -6.8.1 on the
Slackware-10.0 boxes here. When I reported it to freedesk as a bug they
responded that it's a known irritant but not a bug because it is in
/etc/X11/xorg.conf, and that's set up by the distributors, not freedesk.

   In my case the keyboard was not found. Turns out that in xorg.conf the
device is specified as "Keyboard" while the driver is named "keyboard".
Changed the uppercase 'K' to lowercase 'k' and the problem went away.

   On my fiancee's ThinkPad the default run level is GUI but I'm using kdm,
not gdm. Xfce works just fine with the former and it allows her to shutdown
without a root password or explicit sudo instructions from me.

HTH,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] ports not accessible to local network?
Message-ID: <41A0D41D.3030308@brianquade.net>

I have two machines on a network, rh9cups and fc2bind.
rh9cups runs RH9, has a printer attached, and runs CUPS as a server.
fc2bind runs Fedora Core2 and BIND as the authoritative server for the 
local domain.

rh9cups resolv.conf file lists fc2bind's IP address as its first name 
server, but running dig from rh9cups shows that it is using the 
secondary name server (the ISP) and is not resolving any of my local 
addresses.

 From fc2bind, if I run "nmap localhost" it shows 4 ports open (ssh, 
domain, ipp, rndc).
 From rh9cups, if I run "nmap 192.168.123.2" it shows only 1 port open 
(ssh).
(192.168.123.2 is the IP address of fc2bind)
Can a port be opened for local access only?  And if so, how can that be 
changed?
Is this an incorrectly configured BIND setup?

I am wondering if this is why the print server doesn't work either.  I 
had assumed it was just me because I have had trouble setting up CUPS in 
the past, but since rh9cups does not even see that fc2bind has an ipp 
port open I am wondering if it is the same problem.  fc2bind can see 
that rh9cups has an ipp port open, but it still does not see the printer.

Any suggestions?

  I too would be interested in being a guinea pig for your Python version of controller S/W for the X-10 CP290.  I would be willing to take it in any form if you have basic functionality.  I would like to just use a command-line interface to send immediate commands to the CP290.  So if I can do that in your current Python program, please send to me. 

Thanks!

This is normal; the resolver usually uses your DNS servers in round-

one.

rh9cups shouldn't need to see the ipp port open on fc2bind, because
fc2bind connects as a client to the CUPS server.  It should, however,
see the 'domain' port open, although you scanned for TCP, and DNS
usually works through UDP.  However, it's probably the default firewall
setuo which is blocking both.  For the short term, run 'service iptables
stop' and see if you can get things working, then re-enabled the
firewall and configure it appropriately.

A little context. I've got FC3 running on my desktop computer and I'd
like to upgrade the FC2 on my laptop. Last time, I installed from CDs on
my laptop kept hanging with the CD drive running. For some reason, it
would only work properly if the laptop was running on battery.  Anyway,
this time I thought I would try an ftp install from the desktop.  As
part of that process I need (I think) to get vsftpd to accept anonymous
logins.  I can't seem to get that to work.

I've enabled it in /etc/vsftpd.conf and restarted xinetd, but I still
can't log in, as ftp or anonymous.

Any ideas?

That's the direction in which I'd like to move, too. Have you worked with C? I 
have not, but I have code that is supposed to control a CP290. If we can 
extract the part that does that, get it to work, and ignore all the other 
things the program purports to do, we should be able to create a command line 
tool for the CP290. I also have the original programming guide for the CP290, 
so I think I have all the documentation needed to create all the options for 
the command line. 

Ideally, the command line program would accept parameters and would return 
whatever the CP290 spits out. Then, we could design other tools to make use 
of it, as we choose. Personally, I'd like to create a web interface so I can 
run it from around the house, and I'd like to set up the programming for it 
within a crontab. With a command line tool, both should be possible.

I'm trying to make progress but danged if my life doesn't keep
getting in the way. I'll have something soon I hope. It might even
work.

I have no app yet, command line, GUI, or otherwise. All I've got is
Python module with an API. So for the first release you might have to
slap together a little Python code if you want to get any actual use
out of it.

A lot of Imail sites don't pay attention to the smtp reject code text
when they send a bounce to one of the users they are hosting.  How 
since these Imail servers ignore the smtp error code do I send a bounce
message informing the person who attempted to send mail that the
recipient name they used isn't supported or has moved?  The closest 
I've found googling is mention of the bounce manpage, but  
no explanation of the keywords that shows how to use them.  
It's man 8 bounce.

There's the optional relocated table.  I want to implement it's
functionality with a bounce message.

Oh, wait, I have an idea.  How about using the right fscking conf file;
that would be /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf.

Subject: [PLUG] Finding hidding filesystem usage
Message-ID: <9e0a3578041123094552eebc18@mail.gmail.com>

I have a box where df shows 13GB used on the root filesystem.  Doing a
"du -sh" shows about 4GB of data used by the directories off root (ls
-a doesn't show any additional files or directories on root).  There
are a couple NFS mounts, however, and I suspect that the other 9GB is
hiding in one of the directories that is now being used by NFS.  Is
there a way to see what's in those directories without unmounting the
NFS shares?
Thanks,

Hrm.  Because the imps2 supports 3 buttons + scrollwheel, I'll bet
GPM thinks the right button on the trackball is the middle button.
As root, you should be able to try different GPM configs.  Just do an
/etc/rc.d/rc.gpm stop (does it work that way on your distro?)
and then try things like 'gpm -t autops2', try some cut'n'paste and
then do a 'gpm -k' to uninstall it.  the 'fups2' mouse type might work
for you.

Hey everybody-

I'm looking at going in with a few friends on a cheap 1U rackmountable
box to drop somewhere (preferably in the US) for a nice 'play' box.  It
will host a few OSS-related webpages, personal webpages, and other such
things.  I'm expecting to use no more than 50GB/month.

I'm looking for a good deal - a really good deal.  Most everybody offers
WAYYYYY more bandwidth than I want or need for more money than I want to
spend.

A few potential hits have been local - sterling.net and forked.net.
Have any of you guys had experience with either of them?  In your
opinions, are they reputable?  Do y'all know of others?

I'd ideally like somebody who can provide bandwidth when it's needed...
if I offer a 200K file, I don't want people to have to wait while it
downloads.  I'd also not like them to have to deal with high latencies.
I'd also rather not be on a bunch of blacklists because of neighbors.
But I don't want to pay for a bunch of bandwidth I never use.

Any thoughts?  :-)

Or use the handy tool "gpmconfig", which has a help function that really
speeds up the hunt and peck.

Perfect for a "play" box.  I wouldn't run ebay off it, but it works
great for the small amount websites and email for friends & family.

Sterling is very, very reputable.  I've used them for almost three
years to colo a box and they have great service.  Also, their colo
room is incredible, 24/7 card key access, tons of available bandwidth,
double redundant power (UPS and generator) and a fire suppression system.

It's worth the trip just to see it yourself.

I'm actually moving from a pair of UML-based servers.  UML is nice, but
you're at the mercy of everybody and anybody else sharing the box with
you.  If they start eating up CPU (or I start eating CPU), my (or their)
UML will start to lag.

I'm just getting tired of it... a real box is in order.  :-)

Thanks for the vote!  Their website seemed more professional than
forked.net's and I just had a better impression from the email.

However, forked.net just offered me a very good deal.  Unless sterling
comes close to it, I might have to go with forked.net.  I haven't heard
back on an actual price from sterling yet, however.  :-)

Maybe I'll check it out... although I'm booked most of this week.  :-\

   Does anyone use anything other than xfig, tgif, sketch, dia, etc. for
planning program design? I wonder if there is an equivalent to E-R diagrams
for database design that I've not yet encountered.

Thanks -- and happy Thanksgiving all,

I'm trying to track down some problems with tpconfig.
Examining /var/log/messages, I see that init tried to start tapconfig
twice, once labeled hostname touchpad and once as hostname rc touchpad
The first failed=>hostname touchpad: fatal: Could not open PS/2 Port

The second succeeded=> mercury rc: Starting touchpad:  succeeded

I don't know what the rc means.

Help?

To get at the contents of a .deb package, first run "ar x somepackage.deb"
(s/x/xv/ for verbose mode) and then untar the file "data.tar.gz" (I'm not
sure it's called exactly that, but it's something like that) which was
extracted.

AAARRRG, it seems to have been deprecated, use "dpkg-reconfigure gpm"

Sure.  I'm looking for 1U of space (I can build a 1U box for under $500)
and am only planning on using about 50GB/month worth of bandwidth, so
I'm trying to scale down lower than what most folks offer.

It looks like Kattare.com would offer it to me for about $200/mo.

Forked.net is offering me $50/mo, but asked about usage first, so I
think it's a special deal - I don't know the qualifications for the
deal.

Sterling.net hasn't gotten back to me with a price yet.  I responded to
their email asking me for more information on Tuesday night... hopefully
Friday or Monday I'll have something back from them.  They're my top
choice right now - I just hope they have a price that can compete with
Forked.

Inflow said they could work with me, but I haven't gotten around to
calling them yet.

Those are the local boys.

assertive.ca has a facility in Seattle and have a $100/mo special with a
lot of bandwidth.

Ziren sublets HE.net space - I think they have a facility in Seattle.
They offered $200/mo for 512Kbps in the 95th.

Those are all the companies who emailed me back when I asked them for
information.  There were probably another five I emailed on Monday.
ThePlanet.com, based in Texas, would do it for about $150/mo, as I
recall.  I saw several other webpages offering ~$150-200/mo with varying
amounts of bandwidth.  Kattare was the only one I can think of that
would cost me extra for the amount of bandwidth I'm using - they charge
a flat $4/GB.  To their credit, however, they offered and are now
hosting the primary US mirror for SlackSec and will continue to do so as
long as it stays under 1Mbps as measured at the 95th percentile.

Message-ID: <20041125200754.17028.qmail@web50608.mail.yahoo.com>

This is primarily a Linux list, but I thought I'd
experiment with FreeBSD, and after installing it (X
working) I find a few residual problems:

1. Radeon 9200 display adapter may not be recognized:
defaults to 640 x 480. Patch?

2. No printing. CUPS seems to work with Ethernet print
server, but the driver doesn't work properly with HP
Deskjet 960c. (It prints garbage as a "generic
printer.")

3. No sound. The sound card is the popular Creative
PCI512, which works with Linux. The mixer has an X
through it on the KDE desktop.

Any comment on the foregoing issues would be
appreciated. None of these problems is apparent when
using the same computer with Fedora.

Have you tried EasyStreet?  You get 3U in their "condo co-lo" for around
$100/mo (IIRC); not sure about the bandwidth.

Hell, I'll sell you 1U on my rack in my basement for $75/mo for an
~800kbps (outgoing) connection.  Of course, you won't get 24 hour access
and the environmental and power controls will be inferior. ;)

$100/mo is more than I want to spend on this, though... we're looking at
*maybe* as high as $75/mo, although that could cause problems, even.

We want the burstable speed and low ping-times you can't provide,
though.  Latency is an issue.

I just talked to Sterling last week. They quoted me $199 per month for a
single server with 0.5mbps or $449 for 1/3 rack with 1mbps. Sterling
does include additional value added services such as content filtering,
primary DNS, and port blocking by their fire walls. 

I've also checked with Hurricane Electric. They have a special now for
$300 per month for 1/3 rack with 1mbps. The down side is that HE is in
Fremont California so if you need to get to your server, there will be a
long commute. 

I'm also planning on getting some rack space by the end of the year so I
might be interested in sharing the space, bandwidth and costs.

First off, some very helpful mailing lists for FreeBSD are 
freebsd-questions at freebsd.org and freebsd-stable at freebsd.org.
(http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/eresources.html#ERESOURCES-SUMMARY)

I can't provide much specific help, as I'm on an older version (4.9) and 
using an older Radeon card (7500).  The 'stable' mailing list can be 
especially helpful with hardware issues.

On the sound card issue - do you know what the correct driver for your 
card is?  I think it might be the 'pcm' driver, but I'm not sure.  Is the 
driver loaded?  If so, the kernel should make some noise when it finds the 
card, e.g.:

  pcm0: <CMedia CMI8738> port 0xb800-0xb8ff irq 10 at device 5.0 on pci0
  pcm0: sndbuf_setmap 1000, 4000; 0xf26f9000 -> 1000
  pcm0: sndbuf_setmap 5000, 4000; 0xf26fd000 -> 5000

check dmesg output.  Also, have you read the sound section of the 
Handbook? 
(http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/sound-setup.html)
it should help you figure out in general what's going on.

Okay, I have the following:

1 HP 1600cn that has a Jetdirect 2552 nic and is color.
has extra try built on bottom. Working when I got my new printer.

2 @ HP laserjet 4l's- both were working when they went into storage
this spring. I got them when I was needing a couple of extra printers
but now are no longer needed.

1 HP laserjet 3p- works good, and has extra toner cartridge. was gift
from friend when I needed an emergency printer(I was low on funds
being a college student and mine was needing a new cartridge) has been
sitting on a shelf for 6 months or better.

Let me know if any of this appeals to you or Mike

I'd suggest Primary Target  http://primarytarget.com.  The owner James
is great and has been running a small colo for locale folks for all
sort of needs.  He is inside the Pitock Building and his rates will be
about what you are looking to reach.

$80/month for 50GB

http://www.primarytarget.com/modules.php?name=colofeatures

Also, his primary customers are those renting simple game machines. 
He has been in business for many years and is very flexible with
customers needs.  His service is great and you don't have the big
corporate feel.  Now you do lose the instant 24/7 access but that
hasn't been a need of mine.  I tend to solve(and create) my own
problems remotely.

I don't now but did in the past and was happy with them.  Speakeasy had
some great promotion that caused me to switch.

I think using Qwest as your ISP means using MSN.  For ~$3 you can get
service from a local ISP such as aracnet, and avoid the stigma of
an MSN email address. :-)

Unless I misunderstood the sales person..

MSN is more...$32  <total>

Qwest is $25.........<total>

total = dsl service + ISP service.

Or at least that is what I understood..

And I agree I DONOT want MSN...





Thanks

Vram..

Looks like the sales person is correct.  Qwest seems to push MSN, but
if you look under "Other ISPs", you will eventually find qwest.net
listed.  This appears to be the service Qwest sales was talking about:

I am using Qwest through Aracnet.  I have been happy with them.  It has 
worked well. Outages have happened, but not for a long while.

You have to make sure that you are not getting the crap MSN service that 
Qwest will try and push on you.  The MSN DSL modems are crap.  (They have 
Windows only drivers that do not function well under Windows.)  Not 
certain what kind of DSLmodems they offer now.  Mine is a pretty old Cisco 
box.

A coworker spent several hours battling a VPN running over a Qworst
connection.  Something isn't right about it... it's like it goes up and
down in speed.  He spent many hours on the phone with Tech Support but
got nowhere - it was like the UDP-based tunnel was just being killed
every few minutes.

I haven't heard anything good from anybody on Qwest about the DSL
service.  I'd stick with a better ISP if I had the choice.

Thanks for the recommendation, Josh... I've added it to the list.

I'm trying to get samba 2.2.8a to work with Windows 2000 where 
I'm running into something called Active directory.  Apparently 
it requires a strange DNS setup where I use Bind 8.4 from ISC, 
not Windows 2000 Server.  

I want to get 2000 networked with non Windows 2000 computers.  
Can active directory be completely disabled or am I stuck with
it in 2000 professional?

I can use some dns and samba tips for Windows 2000 professional.

The only other alternative I can think of is Windows 2000 on
top of Linux and don't network it.  That would be a pain
though, printing etc. would be difficult.  I don't even know
if Windows 2000 can run in vmware.  As far as Mapinfo, 
MyFamily.com, TurboTax, etc. I'm wondering if Windows is
even needed anymore?

Windows 2000 pro locks up on my network and has trouble finding
other computers.  I've tried to set up a samba 2.2.8a primary
domain controller, but I keep getting dns errors when I attempt
to switch the network identification from workgroup to domain.  
My smb.conf is attached for the samba based PDC I tried to set 
up.  My domain is called domain01 and I did a dns A record
for this.  Microsoft's site says something about SRV records.
Does Active Directory mean that you have to do dynamic dns
even if you don't want to for security reasons?

Technically you don't need active directory on a 2000 pro workstation as
long as you have it a member of a workgroup, when you make 2000 a member
of a domain it uses active directory, which requires a 200X domain
controller.

I cant really give you any tips on security for this set up as I usually
keep my samba pretty simple.  I have my samba server as a member of a
workgroup (which should be the same name as the workgroup on your 2000
PC) and have my security level set to user.  This lets me share folders
and printers between my 2 different OS's with minimal difficulty.

Another alternative is to move to samba 3.X, which has more features for
integrating AD and samba together in a domain type environment.

Sounds to me though like you are looking to just do some home network
sharing.

My home network is also a workgroup (XP Pro and Linux (which is a dual boot
between Linux and XP Pro)). I do not use Active Directory. In fact you need
a Microsoft server like Server 2003 or the older 2K Server to run Active
Directory and manage a domain.

I puzzled sharing files with Linux a while back and wrote up what I found
(samba, active directory, primary domain controllers, LDAP, WINS, etc.). I
understand I cannot attach a doc to this mail. If you want to reply off this
mailing list to tkubaska at ieee.org, I'll send the file to you. Cannot
guarrentee it will help but Windows and Linux can work well together...well,
depends what you want to do, but they share files just fine.

Has PLUG ever had a talk on Windows/Linux interoperability?

I'd love to get 2000 working with 98SE, but I guess this requires a
domain setup.  Ugh.  Anyone have experience with win4lin on SUSE
as an alternative to Windows 2000?  When I was googling it said 
that win4lin can run a number of 2000 applications natively on Suse.
If I end up putting significant effort into samba etc., it might
make more sense to go with win4lin or something else.

I try to use workgroup and I get an error that the servers can't
be reached for domain01 under network neighborhood.  I can try
to play with it a little more.  The good news is that printing
works without Microsoft Networking and I'm starting to wonder
if it would be more convenient to set up a private ftp or 
a netware server.
  

Aside:

Can I use an ultra 2 scsi drive on an adaptec 2940UW controller
or I do I minimally need a 2940U2W card?  I want to move the Windows
swap file to a different hard drive in the hopes of speeding the
computer up.

Occasionally through out the years.  I did an AT talk a few months back
about using Samba 3 as domain controllers and using LDAP as a replicated
authentication database.  Using Samba can get pretty involved,
considering that Microsoft has changed or added new methods with every
release, and Samba has nobs that let you operate with or without most of
these.  That said, a basic setup for the "average home network" (if
there is such a thing) is pretty straight-forward and hasn't changed
much over the years.

Subject: [PLUG] any gcc/gtk+ people out there?
Message-ID: <41A8FF53.8090108@brianquade.net>

I have gcc and gtk+ installed on RedHat 9.  They were installed during 
the installation process.  I don't know of anything missing and I can't 
find anything wrong with the installations.  It installed glibc, a bunch 
of gtk and gcc packages.  Anyway, when I try to compile the most basic 
gtk example:

#include <gtk/gtk.h>
int main( int argc, char *argv[] )
{
GtkWidget *window;
gtk_init (&argc, &argv);
window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
gtk_widget_show (window);
gtk_main ();
return(0);
}

I get the following error:

/tmp/ccOTj6pS.o(.eh_frame+0x11): undefined reference to 
`__gxx_personality_v0'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

I used MSDevStudio for years when I worked in that field.  I have never 
used gcc before, but I really want to get it working so that I can 
develop some stuff.

I thought the problem might just be gtk (no idea what would be wrong 
with it), so I took out all the references to gtk functions and put in a 
cout (included iostream) but it doesn't know about cout.  I have no idea 
what other packages I might need or what I would need to configure from 
the default installation.

Does anyone have any ideas what could be the problem or how all of this 
stuff fits together?

I don't know for sure how this translates to RH, but in debian-land
there are a bunch of -dev packages with headers and such that are not
needed to just run binaries, but are needed to compile things that use
the libraries.  I'd advise looking for those.

I went to a Microsoft event a few weeks ago -- the speaker from Microsoft
expressed offline the interest to speak at some user groups and I mentioned
PLUG. In the spirit of bipartisanship he seemed amenable to a how
Windows/Linux work together talk. If PLUG is interested I can try to put you
guys together. The Microsoft talk dealt a lot with Active Directory.

You're right, basic Samba setup is straightforward, but in retrospect it
seems.  What I do is pretty simple -- mount Windows partitions on Linux and
vice versa. Even so, I struggled with it initially.

Here's something good.  For a total of five vpn's which is a mix of 
linux <--> pix and linux <--> linux using ipsec, they've been very 
stable other than the very infrequent fiber cut.  Of course, Qwest is 
also the isp in this case.

It's possible to uninstall Microsoft Networking, what's to stop someone
from starting an OSS project to develop a file sharing program
installable to any version of Windows or Linux?  Samba's approach is to
attempt to have a program that can simulate Microsoft's server, why not 
replace the client in Windows?  The hooks into various programs wouldn't
line up, but for starters it would be nice to simply have something
that's more convenient than ftp and encrypted.

I am toying with the idea of using Novell Netware.  Can Netware
integrate with old versions of Windows such as 98SE and 2000?  
I don't know the cost of Netware.  I have a student copy of 
Netware 4.7 that I got at the time when PCC was just switching 
over to Netware 5.  My 98 clients tie into a samba based domain,
I think that's why when I put the 2000 box in workgroup mode
that it isn't visible on the 98 boxes and vice versa.  I like
the mounting scripts, but time synchronization would be better
done via ntp.  With profiles, I don't think they are of any use
unless all of your Windows workstations have exactly the same
hardware and software configuration.  You'll load a profile 
from one computer onto  another and find that there are tons 
of broken links.  I am debating the value of a wins server too, 
I can't get 2000 pro workstation to use the one I've set up even 
though 98SE and even XP seem to be able to use it just fine.  
Using a local lmhosts file, even though this is harder to maintain, 
can cut down on network congestion.  If Novell would open source
it's networking technologies and make it's money training and
providing custom solutions, I'll bet that it would just soar.

I'm curious if I abandon doing a domain and put all my Winduhs boxes
in workstation mode if I'll be able to see the 2000 box and vice
versa.

Samba is an impressive piece of software, I'd rather see the client
on the Microsoft end replaced with something better though so that
your filesharing server can be coded better.

I think you're right Russell. It's been a while since I've used Red Hat, 
but unless they have changed things drastically there should be separate 
dev packages with headers in them.

He'd have gotten a compiler error trying to include <gtk/gtk.h>, but
he's getting a linker error.  He probably needs to include several
libraries with '-l'.  Brian, tell us how you're running gcc exactly.

Check out Speakeasy at http://www.speakeasy.net .  Their prices are good
and they're cool with Linux users, multiple dedicated IPs, and servers. 
They have better tech support than Earthlink and much better than Qwest.

Good luck, and tell 'em I sent you....  ;)

The __gxx_personality_v0 stuff is part of the g++ exception-handling 
routines. Make sure the libstdc++-devel rpm is installed.

When dealing with gtk, perhaps the easiest way to set your conpiler 
flags is to use gtk-config (part of the gtk+-devel rpm):

   gcc \
     `gtk-config --cflags gtk` \
     `gtk-config --libs gtk` \
     -o foo \
     foo.c`

It's time to expose my software to a wider world. Find the first

 http://www.blindchicken.com/~terryg/x10py/

I'd previously expressed concern that I would not be able to get
sufficiently accurate serial I/O timing with Python but this has
not been a problem. Without any changes to the timing delays this
software has been successfully tested on machines from a 133MHz
Pentium to a 2.8GHz P4.

As I warned before there are no applications or utilities yet. But
there's lots of sample code provided, so with just minimal knowledge
of Python you should be able to kludge up something useful.

Hi:

I have a different by related question.
I am trying to talk to my TV settop box via serial
interface.  I have a script from someone who
has done it before.  I am trying to modified
it.  I have tried various combinations but
each time I just get back a very generic error (0x00).
It is the same generic error (0x00) even if I have nothing
connected to my serial port.
I am beginning to wonder if my serial port is "working" or not.
I don't k now what is a good way to test my serial port connection.

Can someone offer any tip on how I can capture the serial port output
so I know that data is passing through it?

thanks  for any tip.

Just use your oscilloscope. Or...

What I usually do is plug in an old serial mouse and fire up the gpm
program with the serial port options. (See the gpm man page.) If I
can move the console mouse cursor around using the serial mouse then
I know the port works.

The first time I tried working with the serial port on my laptop, nothing 
seemed to work. Then, I remembered that the port shipped turned off. I 
suspect that most folks remember this, but have you checked your BIOS 
settings to be sure the port is turned on?

                         MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT

                    The Portland Linux/Unix Group
                              will meet
                    7 PM Thursday Dec 2, 2004

                                      to
                                  Subversion

      Programmers (and other creative artists) need version control
      systems to coordinate different contributors' work and to keep 
      track of all the different releases or versions of a project.  
      In recent years, many people in the Open Source community have 
      used Concurrent Version System (cvs) for this.  cvs works well,
      but it has a number of problems and limitations.  

      Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/) is a replacement
      to cvs which has most of cvs's features without some of the
      problems and limitations of cvs.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0411290817180.9162@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I upgraded to firefox-1.0. Now when I want to open a pdf file to view
using xpdf I need to manually set the path each time. In Edit -> Preferences
-> Downloads there's nothing in the box and no enabled button that would
allow me to associate /usr/local/bin/xpdf with pdf files. When I open
about:config I find nothing under 'pdf', 'download' or 'open'. Can't find
anything that looks appropriate.

   If anyone knows how to set this up, please pass me a pointer to the
technique.

TIA,

Rich

Firefox seems to default to your mailcap settings (~/.mailcap, 
/etc/mailcap), so you can set things there, if you'd like:

   echo "application/pdf; xpdf %s" >> ~/.mailcap

Otherwise, once you get to the "What should Firefox do with this 
file?" dialog box, enter xpdf and then click the "Do this 
automatically for files like this from now on" button.

At that point, you can edit those settings in the Preferences -> 
Downloads dialog box.

If you're up for some serious spelunking, check out the mimeTypes.rdf 
file buried in your ~/.mozilla/firefox directory tree.

Paul,

   Thanks. There sure is a lot of cruft in that file that's accumulated over
the years. Sheesh! For whatever reason, I never looked in there to see just
what it was or why it was.

   Hmmm. Don't recall noticing that option. Then again, I'm not looking too
closely when I'm on the hunt for something else.

   This will need to wait until I have more batteries for the headlamp and
lots of rope.

Subject: [PLUG] Getting Moz' To Use XPDF
Message-ID: <20041129104359.6257695c.jason@vancleve.com>

Can one of yous tell me how to get Moz' to use xpdf for PDFs instead of
acroread?  I added an association under "helper app's", but Moz' ignores
it, telling me it handles PDFs "internally" and won't normally resort to
my explicit handler.

acroread really hogs my resources when invoked by the browser, but from
the CLI directly, it works fine, so I'd rather not uninstall it
entirely.  So how do I slap Moz' in the face here?

Jason,

   I suppose that Paul's response to my question on this subject with firefox
would work: in ~/.mailcap add:

application/pdf; xpdf %s

I didn't even have a .mailcap file.  I added one and put in your line,
Rich, but to no avail.

Moz' says it handles PDFs "internally", which makes me frown.

   Well, Jason, you've just reached the end of my knowledge of the solution.
Sorry I couldn't help more.

Does the about:plugins pseudo-URL show a reference to nppdf.so? If so, 
then you'll need to root around Firefox' plugins directory and get rid 
of it.

Maybe.

The easiest way to know is to re-boot and hit whatever your machine uses to 
look at and modify your BIOS settings. On one of my machines that's the DEL 
key, on another it's the F1 or F2 key (I think). But, you should see some 
wording to that effect on the screen. Once you're looking at the BIOS, you 
will have to do a bit of digging around, since different BIOS's handle things 
differently. It may be in a section labeled Advanced. What you're looking for 
is something related to ports. Once you find that, look for serial or comm 
ports and make sure that the one you're using is not disabled.  This should 
make a lot more sense when you see it. 

Hope this helps.

Yes. it's called DNS cache poisoning.  BIND hasn't been typically
vulernable for a long time.  However, you have to be careful with nscd
too--I found some things weren't working correctly because 'localhost'
was giving me an address other than 127.0.0.1.  BIND hasn't cached the
error, but it propagated it to nscd's cache.  For that reason, I
recommend editing /etc/nscd.conf and using:

        enable-cache            hosts           no

It's okay to cache group and password data, since that always comes from
trusted sources.  There's not much point in caching hosts data, since
your DNS server will do that for DNS records and /etc/hosts access is
quite fast and few people use LDAP or other NSS sources for hosts data.

BTW, I discovered this using the 'getent' command, which gives you a
libc-view of your NSS data.  (Of course, some applications won't use the
libc functions for hosts data and will implement their own resolver or
use the DNS resolver directly.)

For the curioius, there's some information about NSS here:

http://nakedape.cc/wiki/ApplicationNotes/NameServiceSwitch

I should actually add this info...

This used to work for me with 0.9.3.  With the upgrade to FC3 and
Firefox 1.0, however, the "Ok" button remains disabled, regardless of
whether I try to select an external application or save to file.  If I
shift-click I can save the file, but that's it.  I haven't had time to
investigate.

I'm running Moz' 1.7.3, not Firefox; but, this is nonetheless what I
needed to know.  I found links to that module in
/usr/lib/nsbrowser/plugins/ and /opt/netscape/plugins/.  Removing those
links did the trick.

Much obliged!  xpdf is way faster, and I even like the interface better.

OK, that's kind of funny, but I am serious.  If you don't care about
"family friendly", how about "work safe" or "conducive to a safe work
environment", or whatever your corporate HR lingo for this sort of
thing is.  Basically, what if my manager saw that email sig over my
shoulder before I noticed it?

Or am I the only corporate drone on a list full of self employed consultants?

This question has come up on the list several times in the past, and
various PLUG contributors have asserted their intention to speak
freely, which occasionally includes colorful language.

So, I guess if your manager saw it and asked about it, you'd have to
tell her why you read this mailing list on company time.  I assume you
have one or several good reasons that, hopefully, ought to outweigh
the chances of someone being offended.

Forewarned if forearmed, or something like that.

Also, be careful with any kernel source you might have downloaded to

   I considered responding that if a manager took umberidge with the words,
one could always print out the man pages and show them that it's just a
string of *nix commands. Interpretation is in the mind of the reader.

I'll consider myself warned then, and thanks for the civil reply.  It
is nice to know I'm not alone in my concern, but I understand if the
general concensus is opposed to any sort of restrictions what my
options are.

Heh heh, yes, this is true, though I never noticed any after a
semester working with it at school, just after someone pointed it out
to me.  Funny how that works.

Subject: [PLUG] Semi-complicated Debian question
Message-ID: <37312.10.0.0.80.1101797841.squirrel@10.0.0.91>

I have a semi-complicated Debian question. At least for a semi-Debian
newbie such as myself. The question is:

I need to install the kdemultimedia-dev package. Or, at least, I'm pretty
sure I do. More details below.

However, when I execute "apt-get install kdemultimedia-dev", I get the
following result:

-----------------------------------
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.

Since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that
the package is simply not installable and a bug report against
that package should be filed.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  kdemultimedia-dev: Depends: kmix (= 4:3.2.2-1) but 4:3.3.1-1 is to be
installed
                     Depends: libkcddb1 (= 4:3.2.2-1) but 4:3.3.1-1 is to
be installed
E: Broken packages
------------------------------------------------

Not quite the result I want.

Here's some system info
uname -a
Linux p4m 2.6.9-1-686 #1 Thu Nov 25 03:48:29 EST 2004 i686 GNU/Linux
(pretty much a simple Knoppix 3.6 hard drive install with apt-get upgrade
and the newest kernel from apt-get)

So, it looks like some of the packages I have are newer than the
dependency requirements for the package I want to install. I'm not
especially Debian fluent, so is there a way to force the install, or a
special repository for newer Knoppix packages, or what? I thought the
unstable sources were as new as it gets for Debian packages? Should I
change my sources, and downgrade the whole system to the stable version of
Debian?

My end goal is to compile KSayIt, a kde application that integrates with
the Festival speech synthesis system so I can click on text in X and have
it repeated out loud. I was able to get a working Festival install in
short order with apt-get and a quick mod to the config to fix the mono
output chipmunk-on-speed problem my laptop seems to be susceptible to.
But, I can't compile KSayIt without kdemultimedia-dev! Any suggestions on
how to fix this without blowing away my working debian KDE installation?

Okay, I  had to reinstall to a Suse7 server this week.
I can ssh to my other Suse server but not my win98 client.
I can ssh from win98 to the Suse9 Server
I can telnet and ftp from win98 toSuse7
I cannot ssh to Suse7 from Suse 9
any ideas?
I'm thinking it's a matter of old keys, but I can't remember where to
go to delete them in both windows and Suse 9

Thanks in advance,

Now, can I get rid of these files to free up disk space or do they
have to remain there forever?

I know I should know this, but my mind is not able to focus right now.

Yup, there is a file that provides that information... /var/log/updates
i beleive. Otherwise have a look at at SuSE support knowledge base. This
link might help..

What this is telling you is that it's trying to install a older version
of kdemultimedia-dev.  The kmix version it wants to install is newer
than the kdemultimedia-dev package.

I checked my debian tree and I have kdemultimedia-dev 4.3.3.1-1.

have you run a apt-get update?  What does you /etc/apt/sources.list file
look like.

You don't have to keep them, but you might want to (the tarballs, anyway).

You might wish to re-install someday, or look at (or even change!) the code,
or maybe even remove the software.  (If the packagers were nice, then 
'make uninstall' will do this.)

I wouldn't leave the tarballs in a tmp directory, though.

Thanks Jack,
Now while I'm trying this I'd like to add the error was "Connection
Refused".
Would this still be a likely fix for the issue?

Many thanks.
I'm just rm the tarballs for now and the other junk that didn't work.

When I try to shh from Suse 7 back to itself I get an error:

ssh 192.*.*.* port 22  : connection refused

I can even telnet from suse 7 back into itself, just not ssh

The info from the Novell site was interesting, but did not address the
issue, which I think may be tied to tcp-wrappers info except that I
can telnet but not ssh

Any thoughts?


Thanks,

Harry

It depends on how your sshd is configured to run, whether it's standlone 
or run through the TCP wrappers. I haven't used SUSE much so I'm not 
sure how they set it up, but a lot of people tend to run it standalone 
since there's some overhead when is starts up.

If it is being run through the TCP wrappers, then you'll see an entry 
for it in the TCP wrappers conf file.

"Connection refused" is an error that rules out things like problems 
with keys. You're not making a connection at all. If you're getting that 
when you try to SSH back into itself, that certainly rules out network 
problems.

A common cause for those "connection refused" errors is when you try to 
connect to a port where no service is running. The most likely problem 
is that sshd is just not listening there. Perhaps it was not installed 
when you rebuilt the box, or it is not configured to start up properly. 
That's the first thing I'd check. If it's not in the process list, see 
if it's installed, and if you can start it up by hand.

Beyond that, check it's access restrictions, and any firewalling rules 
you have set up.

As for the fact that telnet works, that doesn't mean much since they are 
different services on different ports. It may be pertinent if telnet and 
sshd are both run through the TCP wrappers and their config is the same, 
though.

I hate to ask the obvious, but is sshd running?

Okay,
Ssh is/was running. 
Turns out there is something(unknown) missing in the OS install.
So, I reinstalled and voila, it is working. and I can even mount NFS
from my other(SuSE9) box.

everything works like it should except:
(you just knew there had to be one, right?)

I cannot mount the nfs client on my Suse9 box now.
No idea why, it was working before the Suse 7 dropped a drive(another
long story, but which is fixedd)

So, now I get to play the install game with the Suse9 box.
Next week.

But thanks to everyone for their ideas and suggestions.
Sometimes it's just better to do a fresh install.
As my Favorite Linux instructor often said:
" You never really get to know a system till you've had to reinstall
the os about 2 dozen times."

So, how about that hockey violence? :)


Thanks All,

Harry
