John,

What self respecting Linux user would not have a Knoppix or live Ubuntu copy
handy to recover a file to a memory stick?
At the very least, it would have shown you the issue with the hard drive
immediately.

Subject: [PLUG] Bad-mouthing ext3

Several times I have complained here about ext3. It turns out that I may owe
ext3 an apology. 

The other day I was at PSU and my computer would not boot. The Compaq splash
screen came up, then nothing. Of course, this happened when I had a
presentation due in four hours and the Impress file was on the computer. And
I have to run it from the computer through the AV stuff in the classroom
because if I try to run an OOo file from my H drive it would not likely
work. I doubt that the university has OOo available on the computers in the
classroom, let alone the IPA fonts I needed or the sound clips I had links
to in the Impress file.

The help desk in the basement of Smith could not help, but suggested that
the CAT people in the CompSci building could probably assist a Linux user.
On the way to the CompSci building it dawned on me that if Grub was not
coming up, this must be a symptom that the hard drive was not found. You'd
think the BIOS would have the common sense to explain this to me instead of
just hanging, but we're talking cheap HP hardware here.

When I got to the CompSci building the first thing I asked for was a small
phillips head screwdriver so I could reseat the drive. Believe it or not, in
the entire place no one could come up with a small phillips head
screwdriver. 

Back to the basement of Smith, the help desk people ushered me into the back
room where students were busy putting electronic things together.
The jefe running the place asked a student to hand me a small phillips head
screwdriver, whereupon the student handed me a slot head screwdriver. There
ensued a discussion between the jefe and the student about the difference
between phillips head and slot head (I am not making this up), at the
conclusion of which I finally secured the loan of a small phillips head
screwdriver.

Two minutes later my computer was happily booting into Ubuntu.

The point is that the continual corruption I have been experiencing may have
nothing to do with ext3.

My 2 year old LCD monitor has a 400:1 contrast ratio and a 16ms response 
time and I find image quality to be sufficient, I don't play movies or 
twitchy video games on my computer though.  I'm also not doing anything 
like pre-press color proofing but I do photography as a hobby and I find 
it to be good enough for my needs.  Oh yeah, and it works great for xterms.

Indeed, my 2-year old LCD with 500:1 and my wife's brand new
widescreen LCD with 800:1 are not really noticeably different to my
eyes.  The biggest difference is hers has a glossy screen while mine
is matte.

You should also look at the brightness.

FWIW I think the model she got is an Acer AL2051W.  Although I don't
remember it being as expensive as the prices I'm seeing now.  Maybe it
was the previous generation or something.

Well, they seem affordable to me compared to the last time I checked 
prices on such things.

A 20-inch widescreen LCD capable of a native 1680x1050 resolution can be 
found for under $300 if I am reading the ads correctly.

Considering that I have been running the same old semi-broken NEC 
MultiSync XP17 for the past ten years (it was used and focussed badly when 
I got it), the upgrade seems worth whatever I can put into it.

Now, I watch movies on my computer all the time.  But it seems like this 
level of quality will be fine.  If anyone has different experience or even 
if you just have a problem with what you have, let me know.

It used to be, on other machines, and on the first install of SuSE 10.1
on this machine, that moving the mouse resulted in a nearly instant
display of the desktop after the system had blanked the screen (what I
use instead of a screen saver). Now, there's at least a one second

Unless things have changed, there isn't a standardized spec for 
measuring contrast.  Different manufacturers may not measure contrast
in the same way.  Hence contrast numbers should be taken with a huge 
grain of salt.

Because you are watching movies, a monitor with faster response may be 
desirable.  You probably want something with a sub 10 ms number.

Guess I'm not a self-respecting Linux user. But bear in mind that my
backpack already weighs nearly as much as I do. OK, that may be a
slight exaggeration. But in addition to the computer have to schlepp
half a dozen books, notebooks, computer peripherals, microphone,
headset, and even my lunch 20 km to PSU and back. Not sure a CD would
hold up very well in that environment.

Also, the first thing I did at the help desk in the basement of Smith
was to ask if anyone had a Knoppix or other live CD. The girl at the
counter went around to everyone asking if anyone had an "optics" CD.
(I'm taking Phonetics, I know what she said.) Anyway, upon discovering
what a Knoppix live CD was she suggested the CAT people in the 4th
Avenue building. It was on the way there that I realized that the
problem was probably the hard disk. 

Meantime I am working on a permanent solution. When I got home last
night I removed the hard disk to see if I might be able to fix it. I
was assuming that I had a faulty connector in the drive bay. I arrived
at this assumption because the problem occurred with two different hard
disks, the original and the new 80 GB 7200 rpm one that I replaced it
with. The culprit had to be either the connector in the drive bay or
the connector on the drive, and it would be unlikely to have bad drive
connectors with two brand new hard disks from different manufacturers.

But when I opened the drive bay and took a closer look I realized that
the hard disk connector was not meshing completely into the connector
in the drive bay. It was about 5 mm back from where it should have
been. The problem was that the screw holes in the sides of the drive
bay cover were 5 mm too far back. HP/Compaq should have made the holes
elliptical so I could slide the drive back and forth a bit, but the
holes are just plain round holes. I also noticed that the drive was not
fully down into the connector.

I solved the first problem by removing the screws and just leaving them
out. And I also placed a shim between the drive and the drive bay cover
to force it down more into the connector. So far my fix seems to be
working. If the drive slides around too much because of the missing
screws, then I'll get out the Dreml tool and fix the holes, or get out
the super glue or something. As a self-respecting Linux user I must be
prepared to get physical with my computer from time to time. Oh, and I
now pack a small screwdriver. :)

I just wanted to post that evidently there is nothing wrong with ext3.
Because I was having continual corruption I had assumed there must be
some glitch in ext3 when used on an amd-64 kernel or something. This
happened off and on from the first day after receiving the brand new
computer, and it seemed to me that a software problem was far more
likely than a brand new computer with component problems -- especially
as I know a couple of others with the same computer running Windows,
and they never had any problem.

I am currently working at Pacific Solutions and we

inexpensive acer wide screens to CTL's(portland based)
and the higher end Planar(Beavertron based).  Stop on

DVI solves one problem - if you use analog HD15, you may have problems
with sampling ripple with some old cards.  This makes a checkerboard
pixel array shimmer.  Not a problem with DVI, but folks that want to
use their old VGA port should be careful here.

Another thing that may matter is off-axis viewability.  How far off
"straight on" do you want an acceptable picture?  The stated "degrees"
are exaggerations;  the picture starts looking crappy long before the
big angles quoted.  One thing they do not quote is how it looks off
axis towards the corners;  the viewable angle on most monitors looks
like a blobby plus symbol, with crappy presentation for modest angles
towards the corners.  This is especially so with faster displays;
viewing angle trades off against LCD spped.

One thing that is important to us Portland area granola-heads is power
consumption.  The ViewSonic VG2021m that I bought (for $230 from "that
big store that hires the mentally challenged") is a bit of a watt hog
according to the comparative specs - 55W compared to typical 35W or
40W - but if I set the intensity to halfway and the power drops to
a tolerable 25W (this is measured with my Kill-A-Watt power meter,
available from GoLinuxShop for $18.13, see http://snurl.com/13uq0 ).
It is still quite bright.  I figure I will get extra life out of the
CCFL backlight, and have extra drive power in the future as the bulb
dims.

Oh, and one annoyance on the ViewSonic is the "Resolution Notice",
which pops up during boot to tell me that the monitor can do better
than 640x480.  Fortunately, you can turn it off.

Watch out about radiating less, apparently 24" LCD electronics are close
to the power consumption of a 21" CRT.

Ideally, sure. Note that the often measure the transition time starting
from grey, so the real response time is higher. There are two really big
gotchas that you'll want to consider:

LCD color reproduction isn't anywhere near as good as CRT color
reproduction. This is most significant with black, LCD black doesn't tend
to be very dark at all. They also tend to quote contrast ratios with
brightness at maximum, so black is even less black, just the whites are
even brighter. This may or may not be acceptable to you.

LCDs have a fixed, and often rather low resolution. Most 19" LCDs are
1280x1024 at best, while 19" CRTs will do 1600x1200 or better. Even
though you get more surface area, that surface area may be of limited
value due to fewer pixels. This may be a major factor behind multiple
monitor setups becomine common, you're compensating for a device that
doesn't allow high resolution.

Intertwined with the last point, sure widescreen might be useful, but
non-widescreen may be better value. A 21" 4:3 display is significantly
larger than a 21" 16:9 display. Particularly there is a large chance
you'll get quite a few more pixels on a 4:3 display than a 16:9 display.
At which point, at times when you want 16:9, simply allow the LCD to
letterbox, and you may still get the same resolution out of the 4:3
display.

FWIW, I have a couple Samsung SyncMaster 204T LCDs that are 1600x1200.
They weren't cheap (~$500-$600 a year ago).  I am happy with them,

Maximum is 15A, 125V.  It only measures down to 0.01 Amps, so low
power devices like wall warts don't register accurately, but it
seems to be accurate within a watt or so.  It can measure VA 
(including reactive currents), and measure accumulated kilowatt
hours as well.  I was surprised to find that our refrigerator 
averages only 47 watts over the course of a day, and that the 
Thinkpad AC adapters I leave scattered all over do not register
even 1 watt when not driving a laptop.

BTW, I use an instrument called a "curve tracer" to look at
the AC adapters in more detail - they consume 5mA of "reactive
current", and no measurable "resistive current" when running
unloaded, which means that they only cause a milliwatt or two
of extra generator load to the power company - power line heating
losses out to the substation where the phase correctors are - but
nothing like the 1 or 2 watts that an unloaded wall wart consumes.  

It is educational to measure the power consumption of devices
in the office and the house.  The biggest current draw in my
computer lab is the Tektronix Phaser 350 color "crayon" printer.
Our largest "electrical sin" for our house is our water heater,
due to my daily hot soaky baths in the evening.  I will have to
work on that ...  but not now, it is time for my bath :-)

So buy some power meters, and give them as Christmas gifts.  Your
soon-to-be-ex friends who should use less electricity will be
reminded of your strident hectoring even when you are not there!

I've been lusting after the 30" Dell LCD monitor, so this comment sent
me scurrying off to find out about power consumption. Perhaps the
monitors in the 20" range consume more power, but the 3007WFP sips 147
watts in normal operation and 177 max:

http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/3007WFP/EN/about.htm#Specifications

Compare that with the 370 watts my aging 21" Viewsonic CRT sucks outta
the wall. Of course, this time of the year that is not a problem, as it
serves double duty as an auxiliary space heater. It also makes a good
electronic dust cleaner.

 Well it looks like MS is now lining up to after directly after Linux 
with Ballmer's rant about Linux violating MS patents. Of course, I hope 
the idea that IBM has many patents that MS uses is true amd will tame 
them a little bit.

That isn't a 19" LCD though. My 19" P1110s will do 1800x1440 at 75Hz, the
24" GDM-FW900s will do 2304x1440 at 75Hz. The contrast is even worse if
you're comparing by visible area (since the CRTs lose an inch then,
2304x1440 in 23" effective).

My laptop is 1920x1200.  They seemed to have stopped selling that 
resolution though. I think it made the mouse cursor just a bit too small.

Message-ID: <45720B8F.3080702@hevanet.com>

At the last Linux Clinic, Chuck Metzger was there (left his modem, but 
that's
another story).  I, with the help of some others, installed Edgy and 
tried to
set up the external modem for him.  We didn't have the modem connected at
the time, and I used System->Administration->Networking to do the setup,
and I added the modem app (icon) to the tool bar.  Chuck called me this 
afternoon
to say that he couldn't get the modem to work, that the drop-down menu that
offered Activation/Deactivation had those items grayed out (he said that he
used to use the Activation item to get the modem to dial).  I got out my old
external modem and went through the same installation process on my system,
with the same result.  I'm sure that the modem is talking to the system
(correct params, minicom carries on a reasonable conversation with it).  I'm
sure I'm missing something here, and I haven't used an external modem in 
a long
time.  The Ubuntu wiki offered not much more information (I did go 
through the
pppconfig process and tried wvdial, which only confirmed that it could
talk to the modem).  My modem not actually connected to a phone line,
so there is no dial tone.  Any suggestions?

100 dpi, but the subtended angle of each pixel can be calibrated by
adjusting how far away you sit.  No distortion in the corners.  Black
looks black.  White looks white.  It plenty bright for me, kimosabe.

Subject: [PLUG] Shuttle ST62K fan failure
Message-ID: <20061203203810.GA4294@gate.kl-ic.com>


A year ago, I bought a Shuttle ST62K small format PC for my wife's
office, and it has been running SUSE 10.0 and automatically updating
and doing nightly backups back home to the server.  All well and good.

However, the fan has a problem, and from a google search I've learned
that many people have the same problem.  Either the fan device itself,
or the power controller on the CPU board, have problems, and I suspect
both.  About 6 months ago, the fan stopped running, so that the CPU
heated up to >100C and then shut down the system.  Moving the fan plug
from "FAN1" to "FAN3" cured that.  A week ago, the overheating started
occuring again.  The fan will come on under some circumstances, but
mostly not, and the machine never stays running for long.

The fan will run directly off the 12V supply, but it is very loud
and cools way more than necessary.  For normal operation on the 
ST62K, running the fan between 6 to 8 volts keeps everything properly
cooled, and the fan is much quieter.

The expedient hack suggested by some folks on the web is to connect
the fan from the 12V to the 5V connection on one of the 4 pin disk
power supplies, hard wired, bypassing the speed control and powering
the fan with 7V = 12V-5V.  The problem with this hack is that electric
motors without speed controllers look like dead shorts until they are
turning, so that at system startup the motor could drag the 5V supply
rail up to the 12V supply.  This would also occur if for some reason
the fan jammed or was shorted.  Bye-bye peripherals running on 5V. 

The hack I came up with was a little more work - I powered the fan off
the 12V supply to ground, but dropped the voltage with 8 power diodes,
which lowered the voltage to around 7V.  One advantage of the diodes
is they have a "negative temperature coefficient", which means the 
voltage across them drops a bit when they get hotter, and that means
a little more voltage for the fan when the system heats up.  I have
the diode strings running in front of the airflow to the fan (surrounded
by heat shrink tubing).  A major hack, but it keeps the system cool.
Perhaps too well, the CPU temperature is at 38C right now and it could
stand to be higher, while I imagine the system sounds pretty loud in
my wife's office on a quiet weekend.  I may add some more diodes.

BTW, I could not quickly find a gnome panel applet that works with
SUSE 10 that displays cpu temperature.  That would help my wife keep
tabs on the machine.  What I do instead is run a little script:

 #!/bin/bash
 while true
 do
 date | perl -pe 's/\n/ /'
 acpi -t
 sleep 60
 done

That prints the temperature every minute, into a two line text window.
I run the same script from my home office over the vpn, so I can watch
this kludge for a few days.

When comparing LCDs and monitors, one should also consider power,
radiation, deskspace consumed, pollution, and fire hazard.  A friend's
house was burned down by flames from a failing monitor high-voltage
circuit.  Fire can also happen with the high voltage that drives the
CCFL backlight in an LCD (and oh how I wish they would use ultrabright
white LEDs instead), but it does use quite a bit less power and voltage,
so the fire hazard is less, all other things equal.

Analog monitors contain a few pounds of lead-glass to cut down the
X-ray radiation, so if they are improperly discarded they will pollute.
And the cathodes of the CRTs will wear out.  So will the CCFL, but
that is much cheaper to replace (though an extreme pain in the butt
for laptops, I just did so, poorly).

A year ago, I was working on a project that would have blown away
both technologies had it worked.  It was an ultra-low-cost projection
system that magnifies and optically amplifies and color-splits the
monochrome image off a single very small LCOS display chip and projects
a large color image.  40 inch projection display for $300, anyone?  Yes,
with folded optics and plastic mirrors it would still occupy about half
the thickness of an analog CRT, but it would have been quite light and
very low power because it used all the photons out of a low cost lamp.
Sadly, there were too many pixel defects in the optical amplifier, and
fixing them would have taken too much basic research.  But someday,
someone will find another kind of optical amplifier with fewer defects,
and all CRTs and most LCD systems will get replaced by it. 

No more CRTs in landfills.  Sigh.

Until then, reycled CRTs (until they die) are the best, with LCDs
being the best for new purchases.

       Mr. Lofstrom, 
             I have a question for you. What happens when the LCD's 
start hitting the landfills?
    Sure, there isn't as much glass and phosphor, but are there other 
things that may be worse?

Keith writes:

No.  If they are made with lead free solder, you could pretty much
grind one up into powder and eat it.  Well, I exaggerate a bit, the
electronics may contain a small amount of heavy metal, like tantalum
in some of the capacitors, but these are milligram amounts rather than
kilograms as in CRTs.  Most of the weight of an LCD monitor itself is
plastic and glass, and those are very low toxicity (non-leaded glass
is just modified sand, mostly).  The electronics industry is cleaning
up its act rapidly, and very much concerned about durability and
recyclability, because there are enough concerned customers to make
the extra effort pay off.  Look for "RoHS" labelling (Restriction of
Hazardous Substances, an EU program) on new products;  this new program
has some reliability concerns, but they should be worked out in time.

The actual LCD goop itself is a very thin layer - a micron or so -
between two sheets of conductor-coated glass.  The goop is usually
some exotic CNOH organic, probably biodegradable in time.  So a 20
inch panel might have a quarter cubic centimeter of goop.  You burn
off more automobile tire getting the thing home from the store.

The question becomes, why would LCDs hit the landfills?  There is
very little to wear out, besides the cold cathode fluorescent
backlight, which can be replaced.  Of course, all electronics can
wear out, but many of the high stress components are replacable if
a repair industry exists.  One reason LCDs would hit the landfills
is obsolescence, but if they are still useful, there are places like
Free Geek that can find new homes them.  Some might get accidentally
smashed screens, but the other parts are still usable as spares. 
What remains is bad design, or evil design --- LCDs with mis-features
or poor reliability that make nobody want them.

What remains is the significant labor, materials, power and water
that go into making LCDs, or any other manufactured item for that
matter.  So don't buy more than you need, buy well-made goods,  and
treat what you do buy with the same care that went into making it,
then get it to a responsible recycler (like Free Geek) when you 
stop needing it.

At the risk of going off-topic, this discussion has me wondering a bit
about lead and glass. Meine elders were Deutsche and I have inherited
the odd "lead crystal" object. Now, it occurs to me that, in the
unlikely event such items made their way into a landfill, the lead
would be pretty much trapped inside the glass. Not that I am going to
drink high acid wine from them, but do we really need to worry about
lead inside of glass? Yes, I suppose given enough time the lead would
leach out. But I'm guessing we're talking about tens of thousands of
years here. Surely Ma Nature can handle that, right? For that matter, I
can go to any of a number of stores right here in PDX and buy more lead
crystal. Were it really that evil, wouldn't it be banned by now?

So why are we so worried about lead in the glass in CRTs? Or is this
just one of those pop culture things where people hear the word "lead"
and freak out without thinking things through?

I bad-mouth ext3 all the time.  Probably unfounded as I'm no filesystem
expert, but I've been using ReiserFS since 2.2.19 (custom woody install).

I recently switched my lvm+dm-crypt /home from reiserfs to jfs.  This is
on a laptop and occasionally it gets turned off without shutting down
properly.

So far I've had more issues with jfs than reiserfs.  No data loss, but
with jfs, I have to switch to a console and jfs_fsck and all is fine.
Reiser never had these issues.

Will probably go back.  ReiserFS (v3) can do metadata and data
journaling now.

If you don't want to fire up perl every 60 seconds, you can accomplish 
the date line using nothing but shell builtins:

  echo -n $(date)' '

Nice!  I'd been wanting something like that for a while.  I'm curious
how much power my old Lexmark laser takes.  (Also, I'd like to compare
my Gaggia's power consumption before and after I insulate the boiler.)

I got a BsEE a few months ago.  Would you believe that I wouldn't have
even *heard* about reactive power unless I took electives in power
systems?

Good idea, thanks for teaching me something.  I can also combine both
commands:   echo $(date) $(acpi -t) ... and that makes the script a
little cleaner looking as well as more efficient.  So it now becomes:

  #!/bin/bash
  while true
  do
  echo $(date) $(acpi -t)
  sleep 60
  done

Oh well, I'm still learning to use Perl, and only slowly learning
to /not/ use Perl when it is unnecessary.  :-)   I could do the
whole thing in Perl rather than bash, using the date and sleep 
functions and calling acpi with a system call, but I will leave 
that to Randal as a one-line exercise!  :-)

Clever - but the scrolling in my bash script is intentional. 
If for some reason the system starts to heat up, I can scroll
back through the text window and observe it.

It is a matter of quantity and disposal rates, I think.  There are 
many pounds of lead glass in a CRT to cut down X-rays, at the maximum
possible lead concentration; sometimes 5 pounds of lead in a large CRT.  
The CRT works for about 5 years, then off to the landfill it goes.
OTOH, your inherited lead crystal objects have much less lead by
weight in them, and are kept for a long time, as your example shows
(I have some similar 80yo objects).  So the rate that the material
enters the landfill is far lower.

As far as how fast it leaches out, that partly depends on how thick
it is (diffusion time is proportional to the square of the thickness)
and how small the fragments are.  But it does come out, quite a bit
faster than thousands of years, and it can be somewhat nasty if some
ends up as airborne particles and somebody is nearby to breath it in.

I agree that the fretting probably does more damage than the lead
does, but it is wasteful to make a mess when you don't need to. 
So I look forward to the day when we make CRTs go away, and also the
day when people find something better to do than worry uselessly.

Keith

                                    others

      Ingres is a well known Relational Data Base Management
      System similar to Oracle, DB2, and many others.
      Like Oracle, Ingres has been around for a long time,
      has a significant user base and I (David Mandel) believe
      it has more built-in and/or add-on tools than postgres or
      mySQL.

      Ingres has been available on Linux for quite some time,
      but Ingres is now Open Source and Ingres Corporation
      is developing an Open Source strategy for Ingres.

      John Murphy will be in town and will tell us more about Ingres.
      He is also hoping to bring an associate to discuss a new
      generation of Ingres where they bundle a Linux distribution
      from rPath as part of Ingres.

Message-ID: <45749720.3030007@verizon.net>

I recently bought my wife a new laptop.  It is an HP dv6125om with an 
AMD 64 X2 TL-50.  It has NVIDIA GeForce Go 6150 (UMA) using 128M of 
shared memory.  I wiped the hard drive and installed Kubuntu Edgy...

I have done some research and come up with all kinds of instructions on 
how to install NVIDIA graphic drivers, but none that seem to work.  I 
used Adept to download and install nvidida-glx. 
nvidia-common-kernel(sp?) was already installed.  I rebooted and tried 
to follow the directions in Adept..."sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" and 
got the response..."unable to load nvidia kernel driver!  Be sure to 
have installed the nvidia driver for your running kernel."

uname -a reports

moose 2.6.17-10-generic #2 SMP Fri Oct 13 15:34:39 UTC 2006 x86_64 GNU/Linux

I am thinking that you have had this discussion in the recent past.  Can 
someone point me to proper instructions, or the past discussion (I 
couldn't find in a quick search of the archives), or point out what I 
did wrong or didn't do, please?

Thanks,

Bruce

I recently bought a HTPC that has a 6150 nvidia chip in it.  I spent
some time trying to get it to work under ubuntu, but the driver needed
was in feisty fawn not edgy.  I spent some time with a ubuntu install
somewhere between edgy and feisty before I finally scrapped it all
together and installed debian.  Packages are too closely tied to each
ubuntu release to allow for that kind of installation.

I have a similar laptop.  I don't use Ubintu though.

Here is what I do to get it to work under Fedora.

Download the latest NVIDIA commerical driver.

Make sure the kernel-devel and xorg-sdk is installed.

Boot into runlevel 3.

Run the install package.  Make sure X has the current config for the new 
drivers.

Start x by hand and see if it works.

If you are using Compiz/Beryl there are some extra options that need to be 
set in the config file.  Email me and I can dig out the list.

I know this has been discussed and the solution shared on the Ubuntu
amd-64 forum. You should be scanning that forum anyway -- I have found
it to be a gold mine for help getting those little 64-bit hassles under
control. Just search on that forum for "nvidia" and you should pop up a
thread. I'd give you an URL, but I never bookmarked it, and I have a
final tomorrow. :(

Re: Adept, I think I just installed nvidia-glx with Synaptic, although
I think I had to do one or two command line things afterwards. The
enable command sounds familiar.

I am currently using just the open source nv driver, but in the past I
have used the NVidia proprietary driver and it worked just fine.

John,

Do I remember you posting that you were going to write your trials up

I said I would after my bout with ndiswrapper going from Hoary to
Breezy, and I did so on the R3000 wiki:

http://prinsig.se/weekee/index.php/Main_Page

But I didn't write anything additional about it after going to Dapper
because fixing it under Dapper turned out to be pretty trivial. And I
didn't write up anything on the NVidia driver because it went without
problems for me -- the instructions I found on the Ubuntu 64-bit forum
worked, so why repeat what was already written? 

As for my other trials, mostly they have been documented here and a few
on the Ubuntu 64-bit forum. You can search there for posts under my
name there:

http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=134

Not that I have found a lot of solutions myself. But the threads often
contain fixes to my problems that others have contributed.

Note that I am not currently using the NVidia drivers. The only reason
I installed them to begin with was because I couldn't get movies to
play with the open source driver. But with Dapper the open source
driver has no problems with movies, so I just left well enough alone.

Are you looking for 3D or 2D?  Open Source or free/cheap?

qCad will already be in most distributions.

Varicad might do the trick if you need 3D/parametric and want to pay a 
little.

BRLCad is great if you're making tanks and simulating ballistics, but 
not exactly approachable (at least not last time I looked at the gui, 
but there's been talk of improving that.)

Joe, Bob, Jon, Sue, and TimCAD are usually not done or good.

Don't even look at LinuxCAD.  Run away.

The short answer is that we're not there yet.  Want to write some code?

Denis,

   I don't know that I looked at that site, but I found and tested several 2D
CAD systems. I'm using PythonCAD as a result. It's fairly simple and far
from complete, but it does what I want/need and the author is highly
responsive. I also looked closely at QCAD, but had some issues with it (I
don't recall exactly what).

   What may also be of interest if you have simple needs that can be
accommodated on a single layer is Xfig. While generating a figure last week
I accidently discovered that clicking a different button on the trackball to
end a line insertion produced a dimension line with arrow heads and the
length in the center.

What kind of mechanical CAD? 2D? 3D? STL (Standard Template Library) output?

There's an rapid prototyping project being developed as open source that
will use Art of Illusion as the source of STL files, and so I'm starting
to look at Art of Illusion.

Open Source 3D would be best.  I have an old 2D windows program (Quickcad) which 
works if I do not mind rebooting, but Qcad I find much too cumbersome. Moving up 
to 3D has great benefits.

Thanks, Eric, for the comments.  Looks like I should explore Varicad or maybe 
BRLCad.  I am not a programmer, so you do not want any code from me.

>In Oregon?  Yeah, that is going to work well...

I was recently at a childrens birthday party where the house had been
"greened".

It had a very low profile solar array, as well as a solar hot water
pre-heater.

This pre-heater fed sun warmed water into a tank-less natural gas water
heater.

It was quite the setup, but the temperature of water going into the water
tankless was 120 degrees.

Basically, in the summer you use no gas to heat your water.  I was told that
even in the winter

Temeratures of 70 to 80 degrees input are normal.  The solar array produced
a full 1/3 of the homes

Total electric bill.  

I'd say that's at the very least a great step in the right direction.

Remember a lot of time's solar is putting energy back into the grid....
Or reducing what you are consuming from the grid.  Solar in Oregon makes
a lot of sense, during the summer we have very long days with a lot of
sunshine.  That helps reduce the load on the grid that SoCal is putting
on it in the summer running air conditioning.  In the winter not so
much, solar here, but SoCal has lots of solar to add back to the grid to
help heat Keith's bathwater.

I asked him, and though I don't remember the exact amount, I think about 1/3
of it was payed for
With tax-credits right away, with the solar taking about 10 years, and the
hot-water taking about 5.

Bill,

   Thanks. That's reasonable if they plan to stay in that house at least
another decade.

Are you looking at something like the Samsung SyncMaster 205BW?  I see
one of the big-boxes has it for $299; I've looking at it lately.

How many years to recover the cost of depleting our coal and oil supplies?

How many years to recover the cost of developing a culture that lives as 
though they are the "last generation"?

Huh? I'm guessing that's supposed to be funny. But I don't get it. Nobody 
ships in water, except the silly people who pay money for bottled tap water, 
and I'll wager Portland stores get their stocks of bottled water from just as 
far away. Quite a bit of energy is generated on the east side of the state: 
solar, wind, geothermal, and cogeneration. A fair number of folks live 
completely off the grid. Soo.. did you have a point in there somewheres?

FYI: The US government set up an agency to deal with running out of 
oil: USGS (circa 18xx)

We have been running out of oil for over 100 years and the day never 
seems to come. Beware scare stories - they are big cash generators 
for certain groups.
Thanks

You seem to be assuming that they can't recover any of the costs when  
(if) they sell the house.  However, a rational buyer (if such a thing  
exists) would be willing to pay a premium for the house, based on the  
lower operating costs.

It's about the agriculture.  In order to sustain people out there, 
agriculture must be heavily industrialized -- large-scale irrigation, 
industrial fertilizers, and oil, oil, oil.

Also, the people are further spread out, so distribution of goods and 
services is done almost entirely on a per-household basis by private 
automobile over relatively large distances.

Constrast this to the potentials of living in a well-populated, fertile 
valley and the responsibility factor just skyrockets (not to mention the 
cultural opportunities and means for social growth and enrichment).

How many people here are interested in purchasing one of these meters?  The

Neither wikipedia nor the USGS's own history of itself seems to

   I run only SSH2; version 1 is disabled. In the config files I specify that
pass phrases are to be requested first, and passwords only if [Enter] is
pressed at the first request. This used to work.

   It stopped working a long time ago and my sporatic research has not found
a reason. I've even sent e-mail to the supposed security gurus who write for
linux publications, but have not received a reply.

   Locally, using only a password is fine; we're behind the firewall and
communications is among local hosts. But, when I'm away from the office I'd
feel more comfortable typing my passphrase for access, especially on a
wireless public network (or, public wireless network).

   If you folks who deal with security have suggestions on how to debug this
situation, please let me know.

How many people here are interested in purchasing one of these meters?  The
shipping cost for one is $9, so perhaps we could put together a joint buy,
and distribute them to the buyers at one of our meetings.

Hi Rich,

I find that usually problems using keys instead of passwords is a
permissions issue.  If anyone, or any group other than you, or root
has read or write access to the private key, or to the directory above
it, or if it has write access to the authorized_keys2 file it won't
work.  There is usually some kind of helpful message as to why ssh
didn't work as expected in /var/log/secure, especially if you up the
log level.

   Thanks for the pointer, Dan. I'll look into the permissions issue as soon
as I return.

As long as you check host keys, there isn't really any practical
difference. Your target machine will have the password, if it is
compromised, an attacker *will* get your password (when you log onto the
console if nothing else). Pass-phrases are really most important when
you're going unencrypted through somewhere, either an intermediate sshd
host, or through wireless without encryption.

The logs have already been suggested. `ssh -v` is a tremendous source of
information, in the worst case stopping `sshd` and then running `sshd -d`
is another source of information (remember to fully restart sshd when
done!).

Precisely. If you can't get it, what is the point of saying it exists?
Yet scaling everything would of taken care of this.  :-(   I suppose that
will be nVIDIA's next mission, pursuading MS to make the items under
"accessibility options" much more prominent and encouraging LCD makers to
go super high resolution (more pixels means more graphics horsepower is
needed).

Those are coming, some LCDs are reported to already use them. What looks
better to me would be a direct matrix of RGB LEDs. With the LEDs being a
directly emissive medium, you get the colors back. Doesn't solve the
issue of ridiculously low resolution matricies though.

Given how awful even the LCDs being sold today (resolution and color!) I
imagine obsolescence will be a major issues with LCDs for a while yet.
Meanwhile, though very heavy (and requiring proper disposal) CRTs are a
mature technology.

Which 5 years would that be?

It has been quite some time since I last saw a CRT die. I've only been
seeing them dumped due to replacement with lighter LCDs, I pretty well
haven't been seeing them /die/.

CRTs weren't being repaired for the same reasons as LCDs, it is expensive
to do so and the price of new ones was low. At the moment CRT prices are
still depressed since folks are still replacing them with LCDs. I'm
wondering if CRT prices will spring back and repair shops will become
profitable again due to the dump phase ending...

Unlikely to happen. Airplane scares still get the front page when you're
massively more likely to be killed in a car wreck...

I started this thread, so I will do the order.  I will wait a day or so to give 
any fence-sitters a chance.  Is there anybody signed up that is not in the

Sorry about that, Wil. :-(

As the one who started this thread, with a discussion of power
meters, on plug rather than plug-talk, my apologies for all the
careless people (which includes me) I seem to have inflicted on
the rest of you sane ones.  Unless the power meters, solar water

I'll take one for around $18.13 + share of postage.

What are you talking about?  Both password and public key authentication
methods are secure, regardless of the security of the underlying medium.
All the client has to do is encrypt the password with the server's
public key.  Now, if you don't have the server's public key cached, that
could be the source of a MITM attack.

Actually, the best way is to add the '-p' and set up the debugging
server on a separate port.  If you've got to go through a firewall it's
a little more fiddling, but having a working SSH server seems a
requisite for a happy life.

Come to my house then.  I have a lovely 19" Hitachi CM771 that's got
ants in its pixels.  It's about 5 years old; actually, the date of
manufacture is July 2000.  Not to mention that I have yet to actually
get the edges to line up correctly.

Correct, except that the password can be guessed or gathered.  A 
password-protected file (your private key) on a hard drive is a bit 
harder to socially engineer.

This thread seems to be about client configuration.  Puzzling.  If the 
server is listening on a public port with password authentication 
enabled, that is a source of unsecurity.

I've got a lovely 19-inch Nokia Trinitron sitting un-plugged after it
started making loud POPs a couple times a day.  The LCD is able to sit
farther away, increasing the apparent dot-pitch.

Probably but I recently did a pretty minimal install and it took the 
first three disks.  Two and three went really fast.

Interesting idea.  Just enough of an install so yum via the network 
could be used to flesh out the system.

I seem to remember there was a method to do a network install but that 
was back in. at least my, pre-Fedora days.  It was using just a Redhat CD.

What I usually do is download the install DVD .iso and loop mount it on 
a running machine, then use the "minimal boot" CD to install the second 
system using either FTP or HTTP from the first. Sure beats CD flipping 
:) But it does assume you have two machines.

Depends on what you want to install.  Probably need the first three discs.

I prefer the DVD install.  Less disc changing.

I'm glad the power-meter came up.  Power consumption is important.
Given that the most efficient computer is the one you don't buy, and
running Linux lets you use your existing ones more efficiently...

I guess that's true; if you're on your own laptop, someone could collect
your password by shoulder-surfing.  If you're trying to use a public
terminal, after you've somehow gotten your key where it can be read by
your SSH client, someone could install a key-logger.  Of course, they
could also install a key-logger that also captured your private key (a
patched Putty, for example).  Which would you rather change, your
password or your private key?

It sounds like Rich's issue is enforcing his own practices, not
necessarily wholly blocking external access via password.  If it is,
then you're right.  He'd probably need to run an sshd on a separate port
with a separate config file or disable password access altogether.

Thanks all,

I started the DVD download last night and still have 2 hours left this 
morning (standard DSL).  I will give FC6 a try on the wife's new laptop. 
  I have killed the Kubuntu Edgy install twice trying to install the 
Nvidia drivers.  I am trying FC because it has a solid track record on 
laptops according to one website I read.
I have until 6pm Sunday the 17th to make up my mind to keep or return 
the machine...I am not sure that leaves enough time to attend the clinic 
and still get downtown if just won't accept Linux with my skills able to 
fix or reinstall if something should go wrong.

What an adventure!

Bruce

It would be an interesting experiment to run two identical boxes, one
running Linux and one running Windows and see what the power consumption
figures look like.

If the numbers are big enough it would make a great booth demo.  (I just got
back from ITEC an hour ago, if you couldn't tell...)

Yes, you may have to replace a few components, but getting out of EULA

Not quite.  He is using a cardbus card on a laptop.  I am willing to bet 
that he is running into the secondary pci bus problem.  If he used a 
pcmcia card instead of cardbus it would have worked fine.  (Adding 
"pci=assign-busses" to the kernel line will make the system see the 
cardbus card.)

It is a case of an older machine with known problems that Ubintu does not 
correctly address and no one in the user community who knows where it 
breaks.  (Not an uncommon problem, BTW.)

It is obvious he is just following directions, not trying to understand 
what they mean.

I didn't read every word of their site, but it appears to be a desktop
that emulates Windows. Am I wrong about that? If so, I guess you can
make any software you want and charge for it if you feel like it.
Personally, I am happy with Ubuntu, but I can see a market for it. In
fact, if it really works just like Windows, I can see a huge market in
the corporate world. Of course, the interface probably doesn't work
exactly like Windows. But getting big organizations to switch to Linux
for the desktop is hindered by the training costs. If Linux XP can
eliminate at least most of that problem, it may help Linux make a large
dent in Microsoft's bottom line.

I might also venture that if it emulates the look and feel of Windows,
they may have some serious copyright issues. 

Personally, I'm sticking with Ubuntu and Gnome.

Here's an odd one for the wise old geekbeards. I can't seem to find an easy 
way to list directories only. man ls says:

-d, --directory
 list directory entries instead of contents, and do not dereference symbolic 
links

But ls -d does not work:

$ ls -d
.

$ ls -d /home/carla
/home/carla

Good ole find does the job:

$ find ~ -maxdepth 1 -type d  
/home/carla
/home/carla/.kde
/home/carla/.qt
/home/carla/Desktop
/home/carla/.local
[...]

ls will list subdirectories and their contents:

$  ls -R
.:
./downloads:
asterisk-1.4.0-beta3  asterisk-1.4.0-beta3.tar.gz  AstLinux-0.4.4.iso  
debian-testing-i386-netinst.iso  loop

agi-test.agi  DialAnMp3.agi  eagi-sphinx-test.c  eagi-test.c  fastagi-test

[...]

The tree command is easy and fun:

So except for the prettiness what is the difference of doing:

ls -d */

And 

ls * | grep /

Besides one does some prettying up of the output, not much; however, it is
important to note that 

ls --indicator-style=none -d */

Causes ls to append a / to the end of each directory in order to get the
correct output. Despite the not wanting of an indicator style.

The only use I've *ever* found for the -d option is as a modifier to 'ls 
-l', when I want to see the permissions/ownership of a directory, but not 
the full listing of everything in the directory.  (Which you could also do 
by 'ls -l' on the parent directory and piping to grep, but it saves a few 
keystrokes.)

E.g., 
 dcf>$ ls -dl sourweb/
 drwxr-xr-x  3 dcf users 4096 Dec 31  2005 sourweb/

 dcf>$ ls -l sourweb/
 total 656K
 -rw-r--r--   1 dcf users   4027 May  7  2000 3.27.txt
 -rw-r--r--   1 dcf users   4602 May  7  2000 5.8.txt
 ...
 ...
 .etc

The -d means to list directories as directories instead of recursing
in to them and listing their contents. So 'ls /home/carla' will give you
the contents of /home/carla while 'ls -d /home/carla' will just list
/home/carla. This becomes more evident if you combine -d with some other
option like -l.

  $ ls -l /home/carla

vs:

  $ ls -ld /home/carla

I suppose it's a philosophical thing (keeping ls "small"), but other than
hidden files ls doesn't have any filtering options. It would certainly be
easy to add such options from a programming standpoint, but this has been
left to other utilities like 'find'.

Sections B and C of the EULA outline the distinction between the GPL
software provided with the distribution, and the non-gpl software --
I'd guess that the window manager is some in-house product, possibly a
fork of an apache-licensed WM.

Assuming they haven't patched any of the GPL utilities, (and further
assuming, that if they have, the modified source isn't available on
their site somewhere) then I think what they are doing is within the
constraints of the GPL. (and of course, I'm no lawyer etc...)

I didn't say they didn't die, merely that they don't die quite as often
as Keith was suggesting. I suspect CRTs /may/ be more repairable than
LCDs as well, since it is possible to get at the electronics to repair
them (but don't quote me on that). I've seen a couple CRTs last 10 years
without needing any repairs. They do die, but they still last quite a
while.

What is the point of increasing apparent dot-pitch, when you decrease the
usable real estate? I'm interested in more pixels, not merely higher dpi.

1600x1200 isn't bad though (more is better, naturally), and not
outlandishly expensive.  I wasn't trying to make any more significant

Why couldn't they?  By the way, EULA is not the same as license fee.

                            Ingres is Open Source

                                      by

                                 John Murphy

                                    others

      Ingres is a well known Relational Data Base Management
      System similar to Oracle, DB2, and many others.
      Like Oracle, Ingres has been around for a long time,
      has a significant user base and I (David Mandel) believe
      it has more built-in and/or add-on tools than postgres or
      mySQL.

      Ingres has been available on Linux for quite some time,
      but Ingres is now Open Source and Ingres Corporation
      is developing an Open Source straegy for Ingres.

      John Murphy will be in town and will tell us more about Ingres.
      He is also hoping to bring an associate to discuss a new
      generation of Ingres where they bundle a Linux distribution
      from rPath as part of Ingres.

      *******************************************************************

          Agenda:

              7:00 - 7:30  Business
                   We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects
                   including PLUG's monthly Advanced Topics meetings,
                   PLUG's monthly hands on clinics, PLUG for Education,

It's not the power meters were off topic; hardware is generally on
topic.

Subject: [PLUG] Success story...
Message-ID: <1165450449.10851.43.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I couldn't get an Iomega PC90 scsi card, appears to have an NCR53c400
chip on it, working under Linux.  So, I picked up an AVA-1502E card,
a.k.a. Iomega zip zoom 16 bit ISA accelerator.  This card, other than
having a Bernoulli come up on it as a Beta 150 under Linux, seems to 
be working perfectly.  I'm guessing the Iomega PC90 card is an
incomplete scsi implementation or the generic NCR driver was incomplete
back when the 2.2.14 Linux kernel came out.  Maybe I can put this on my
father's stand alone Linux fileserver for him now.  

Windows 9x/NT/2000/XP drivers were never written for the Iomega PC90
scsi card, so I won't be surprised if a lot of people have them along
with a Bernoulli drive that they can't use anymore.
My advice, get a scsi card with a compatible external port that 
Linux supports to replace them.  These drives are nicer than zip 100
drives because the disks are 1 1/2 times the capacity of a 100 megabyte
zip disk and there's no external power block.  I did have to change the
slot bracket so I could supply power, I pulled the bracket and power
cable from my Iomega PC90 scsi card.  Iomega built up customer trust 
in Bernoulli disk drives, then Bernoulli got dropped and replaced by 
the incompatible zip drive.  Was this intentional?  Why did zip come
out as a 100 megabyte drive at first if Bernoulli was already up to
150 megabytes?  Perhaps at the time of the zip 100 parallel port drive
craze followed by the push to replace the 1.44 meg floppy drive, the
floppy controller on most PC's should have been replaced with a SCSI-2
controller.

It used to be $10 for a box of 25 floppy disks.  Nowadays, people buy
USB flash keys and they are $30 or more a piece.  Sure the capacity
is awesome, but the cost is very high.

Subject: [PLUG] Generic Linux
Message-ID: <1165455252.10851.109.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Who wants to write to 100 or more different versions of the same
platform?  Is it possible to write an application for Linux that
will work on: Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, Slackware, etc. equally?

Ideally, a programmer writes to a generic Linux system and 
does not have to concern him/herself about the specifics of 
individual Linux distributions.  This can translate to 
smaller downloads and hopefully fewer bugs.

Why am I bringing this up as a topic?  Well, people go back and forth
about Linux distributions on here a lot.  There seem to be many Linux
distributions and a growing issue with products coming out for one
distribution and not for another.  This should be a problem for 
Windows, but it is less of one because there are far fewer popular
versions of Microsoft's OS around.  

Some people are saying, this week I'm an Ubuntu person and next 
week I'll go back to Fedora or Debian.  Wait a minute, maybe what 
is needed is more standardization across Linux distributions to 
ease migration.

The differences between CentOS and Redhat Enterprise Linux are 
interesting as well.  They supposedly come from the same source
base, but are they really the same?  Is this something someone 
who wants to work with and use Linux should really have to 
worry about?  

Subtopics under the topic, "What is generic Linux?"

1) For distributions that break out because of some proprietary driver,
   has the time come to say get these out of kernel space or don't
   call your offering a Linux system anymore?

2) If a company writes a closed driver, like the commercial nv
   drivers, how does it address Linux distribution diversity 
   today?

3) What can be done about companies that put out proprietary drivers
   for say Fedora Core 6 today when the next two to three versions of 
   Fedora come out in the near future and the libraries those drivers
   depend on change?  Fedora isn't the only example, replace with:
   Ubuntu, Debian, Slackware, etc.  Heck, puppylinux, whatever it is 
   based on, is a popular distribution too.

4) How many Linux distributions should there be?

5) Do the many different Linux distributions mature evenly?

6) Should the total number of Linux distributions be reduced 
   and the communities behind them combined?

There seem to be a growing number of Linux distributions.  Is this
hurting or helping Linux grow?  What can and should be done about
distribution divergence?

Help needed.  Using the GUI System Settings, I can change the time in

works.  However, upon rebooting the system, it reverts to 5 minutes. (I did use 
Administrator Mode.)

I have scoured the man pages, help documents, and Google, but cannot find any 
help.  Perhaps I do not know the right vocabulary to use in my search.

Anybody know how to make changes permanent?

I dunno.  Read up on "Linux Standard Base" and then ask the maintainers
of Firefox, Apache, OpenSSH or any other application running on Linux.

Remainder snipped, since you'll be able to ask better questions after
you've learned a little about the LSB.

Thanks for asking,

But I won't :-( .  I am an officer at another meeting that collides
with PLUG this month.

However, I sent a messenger with the new, improved PLUG business
cards - thank you thank you thank you Bill Ensley of Bear Printing
in Tigard, the Official Printers of Portland Area open source
I also sent my power meter so those considering ordering one
can see what it looks like. 

Grab a bunch of cards, and give them to folks that might be 
interested in what we do.  I expect none back, I have more.

I /would/ like the power meter back - I deputize whoever to bring
it to Linux Clinic on the 17th or Advanced Topics on the 18th.

What kind of ethernet card do you have?  Every one I have had "just works".

more info please: what laptop, and what card (internal, pcmcia)?
Do ''lspci on the command line and report what it says about
Ethernet controller and Network controller. 

I seem to recall that in Dapper, if there are both Ethernet and
wireless controllers present, the wireless controller is not
activated by default.  You should look at
System->Administration>Networking
(or whatever it is, I'm in Kubuntu right now) and see if the setup says
anything about your wireless interface.

This gets worse all the time ..

I just rebooted and the wireless card comes and the cat5 card does not..
The cat 5 is a megahert card..

And I just unplugged and replugged it and now everything works.

I am thinking the laptop..Which is a noname is old and tired..  It is 600
MHZ PIII and time to replace it..

Thanks for you time..

All of the "major" Linux distributions, assuming the full GNU toolchain, 
compile and execute nearly all stable open-source applications. Where 
the major differences between the distros lie are in how one does system 
administration and how they deal with "non-free" components.

This week I'm a Gentoo person. Last week I was a Gentoo person. And next 
week I will still be a Gentoo person. The only other distro that I'm 
even considering at this point is rPath.

They are supposed to be "binary compatible" yet distinctly branded. That 
is, Red Hat, because of the GPL, supplies instructions for how one can 
build "Red Hat Trademark-Free" binary packages.

Indeed, but the time has past and unless you've got a home-built time
machine handy I doubt you'll change that. Seems SCSI's greatest legacy
will be all the copies of it, rather than pure SCSI itself. Both
USB-storage and FireWire are little more than SCSI plus a little bit of
glue. Even SATA looks surprisingly similar to SCSI nowadays...

Then think a tinsy tiny bit more. That box of 25 floppies is roughly 35MB
total. Plus the modern floppy QC is tweaked really low so they can supply
product cheaply enough, leading to horrific reliability.

Now, that USB keyfob might be $30, but it has a capacity of 4GB or more.
Notice how many orders of magnitude larger it is. Plus the keyfob is much
more reliable and faster. By the time you start burning out sectors on
the keyfob you would of gone through many *boxes* of floppies to transfer
the same amount of data due to reliability. Per byte of storage the
keyfob is a *massively* better value.

Is SATA chain-able? How many devices can run concurrently on one SATA  
cable/bus? Can SATA use 18 feet of cable for a chain? Do SATA devices  
now support extensive command control?
:-)

I guess, in the form of a question, asked with totally open eyes and  
ears:
How is SATA similar to SCSI?

SATA device drivers pretty much build on top of SCSI -- similar to USB
/ SD / SCSI layers.  Probably one of the reasons SCSI is used so much
is, by design, it helps keep the underlying hardware pretty
transparent.  (Linux-wise, at least.)

I'd try loading the svn in inkscape and using it's export features. You can pull out all 
the svn components quite easily, or just crop the exported images at any location and size.

Never mind.  It appears to be a bug of multiple dimensions, including changes 
from seconds to minutes (x60 done by some code somewhere).  Occurs in KDE and 
Gnome.  Live with it until a real (understandable) fix is forthcoming.

Message-ID: <20061209024654.GA32394@gate.kl-ic.com>


A few months ago, I was grousing about the lack of waterproof USB
drives.  I found one:

http://www.kingmaxdigi.com/news/news_product/news_p20051114.htm

The Kingmax Superstick drive is tiny - a little blade as big as
the middle of a USB connector, and about 3 centimeters long, and
claims to be waterproof.  I met a friend the other day with a
few of these on a necklace, and I can imagine some artistic type
painting them with interesting patterns and making "art".  I
ordered a couple from overstock.com.  They also claim to have
them at the local P.C. Club stores.  

One will get a washing machine test, and then I will keep both in
my wallet to see how long they last.

I went all over their site (some of which does not display properly in

Read the whole message.  Second to the last sentence of the larger
paragraph says the answer is overstock.com.  The final sentence
suggests a possible alternative.

Rich,

Run an strace on it if you can.  Maybe a device permission rather than
your file permissions.  Just did a locate keymap and was surprised by
all the keymaps on my FC5 system.  You could compare file permissions
between working systems and your non-working one.

Could that possibly be because you are coming from cadtocam.com, and the
From: header says cad2cam.com, which does not resolve?

Of course, only Rich can deny or confirm my hypothesis.

Ken/Russ,

   We've exchanged e-mail before without tripping this rule. It's a body
rule, not in the header (which would be Hnnn). But, the regex looks for that
list of quicker-dicker-upper drugs and similar chemicals that were popular
among the spammers a while ago.

   Anyway, because Ken is a super nice guy and I did not mean to
inadvertently trap his domain in the postfix filters, I've added both
variants of the domain name to the local white list.

My apologies,

Rich

Is anyone else having troubles accessing the software repositories at 
Fedora Core?  I recently installed FC6 on an HP laptop.


I keep getting the error, "Unable to retrieve software information"...
"Cannot find a valid baseurl for repo: core"

My Internet connection to the laptop is good, I can cruise the Internet 
with a browser.

I was following along with some documentation yesterday and used the 
command "su -c 'yum update'"...did this somehow mess up the other 
programs for updating and fetching?

It appears the problem is solved.  I don't know whether it was clearing 
yum's cache or the repository is back online...either way, all is good now.

Subject: [PLUG] LPR options
Message-ID: <20061209194718.231ad917.johnxj@comcast.net>

I googled all over, but could not find the answer to the following problem.

I wish to print to Laserjet 8000 from Adobe Reader 7.08 Linux. On linux, Reader displays few options. In fact, doesn't even see installed printers. You have to specify everything at the command line. You can enter the command line options in the print dialog box, and Reader remembers the settings. After considerable futzing around, I found that the following line works:

lpr -P Laserjet-8000-Series-Postscript-(recommended) -# 20

That prints 20 copies, collated, to my Laserjet 8000. The printer name is as installed in CUPS. 

There are a couple problems with the above command line. First, the printer's output stacker will offset each copy. This works by default from Windows, but the above command does not print each copy offset. I can't find any reference on command line options to tell the printer to output the copies offset.

Second, when I print from Windows the printer's control panel tells me what copy is being printed (e.g., "printing copy 17 from tray 4"). When I print from Linux I see no information at all. I know how long each copy takes, so I can use my watch to figure out which copy I am on, but this is  unacceptable. Sometimes I need to go away for a while. It would be nice to know whether I need to pause the print job and add paper before leaving.

Any gurus on LPR commands?

I imagine CUPS has other ways of accessing the information, and can give
you more. There are two commands of interested with the old lp interface.
The first is `lpq` (use the same -P option as for lpr), this will give
you the status of the print queue. Modern printers buffer data, so lpq
won't give you a perfect picture, merely some, it will tell you about
running out of paper though. The second is `lpc` (use the -P option as
above), this is for control. lpc will allow you to stop the printer to
add paper, though I've found using the buttons on the front of the
printer tends to work pretty well too.  :-)

If you need port 22 (ssh) to be directed to an internal box, say,
192.168.0.15, at the enable prompt of your 678, enter:

    set nat entry add 192.168.0.15 22 tcp

My inside ip is 10.0.0.1  Router gateway..

My box is 10.0.0.2

So it would be

set nat entry add 10.0.0.2 22 tcp

Did I understand you correctly

So if my dhcp is 212.14.13.67

I can ssh to 212.14.13.67 and end up at 10.0.0.2????

TIA

- Your ssh server could be broken:
  - maybe it's not running
  - maybe you typed your password wrong
  - ....
- you could have the ip address(es) wrong..
....
- the other site you ssh'd to could be using a broken ssh client, or
something... maybe *that* site is blocking _outbound_ ssh.
- The FSM could have decided it's just your bad day, and intervened
with it's noodly appendage to interrupt your computer activities.

"Can't" doesn't help us help you at all.  *PLEASE* pass along the
error mesages, or at least an explanation of what you tried and what
happened.

Looks as though your ISP is blocking pings.  SSH seems to be OK.  Did
you enable NAT on the 678?  SSH traffic doesn't seem to be coming
back.

If your IP has changed, I've just scanned someone else (oops -- a
no-no).  How are you determining what your current IP address is?
What is your gateway, broadcast address and net mask?

:rolls-eyes: Actually, I can't believe I just asked you that.  I
wouldn't give that information out to anyone -- least of all a mailing
list.  So I have to recommend you not do so, either.  Please check NAT
status on your 678 (the most likely problem, at this point) -- and I'm
going to go wake up!

It would be nice to know whether I need to pause the print job and add paper before leaving.

Thanks for the reply. After writing the above I fiddled with things
some more and finally gave up. I can print with job offset from most
other Linux applications, just not Adobe Reader 7.08. The display also
tells me which copy is being printed when I print from other
applications too.

The problem is the lame print dialog box in Adobe Reader 7.08. It is
not aware of CUPS. All it give me is a command line to enter an lp or
lpr command. I finally figured out enough to get basic output, but I'm
afraid I'd have to study lp and lpr a lot to figure out how to make it
do job offset. It may not even be possible. Job offset is pretty much
available only for large printers that have an output stacker. It may
be that no one ever created a command for this in lpr. And if there is
such a command, finding it in the documentation may be a challenge.
Very few people would ever want or need such a command.

Kpdf prints with job offset just fine. It is also CUPS-aware and
therefore has a decent print dialog box. The only reason I want to
print from Adobe Reader is because Kpdf prints the first copy
agonizingly slow. After all the effort I put into figuring out how to
get job offset from Adobe Reader I've decided it isn't worth any more
effort. Someday Adobe may fix the print dialog box. Meanwhile, I'm
going to put up with Kpdf.

As for pausing the printer, etc., I agree. The only reason I'd want to
pause the printer is to add paper, change a toner cart, or something
requiring me to be at the printer. As long as I'm there, hitting the
Online/Offline button is faster than trying to figure out a software
command.

Subject: [PLUG] Ready for website creation tutorials
Message-ID: <20061210194444.2f507245.johnxj@comcast.net>

Some time back I expressed interest in creating a website for students
to practice Phonetics. Here is a site with various exercises
illustrating the kind of thing I want to do:

http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/linguistics/russell/138/course.htm

(You have to try out some of the exercises to see what I mean.)

I also want to create a website that mimics the sample editable PDF
file that I created and posted here:

http://www.web.pdx.edu/~johj

The editable PDF file there did not work because I was unable to embed
a font for the controls. I used OOo, which sets the font for all
controls to Helvetica on PDF export, ignoring the font the user set for
the control. There are no plans to change this behavior. I also tried
Scribus, but it allows only five fonts for controls, none of which have
all the IPA characters. Scribus may correct this soon, but in the
meantime I am thinking that a web page may be a better tool. I like the
idea of the student being able to click on a "Correct my work" button
and having the web page give immediate feedback.

So now exams are over and I have some time to learn a bit about web
programming so that (maybe) I can figure out how to create a site to
provide students practice in Phonetics. Initially, I just want to
create two pages: One which will list the features of a sound with a
drop-down or other means for the student to enter the answer; and a
second one which will be the same except that instead of a description
of the sound it will have a link to a sound file. Later I may try other
types of quizzes and exercises. To accomplish this --

1) I need to figure out how to make sure the students' browsers can see
the IPA characters. My browsers on my Ubuntu computer (Firefox and
Opera) have no problem. But I know that many students have reported to
me that they do not see the characters I post in PSU WebCT. I think the
problem is related to ISO-8859 v. UTF-8, but I am unclear how to fix
it. I need to create a Help button on the web page that will pop up
instructions for students on how to fix their browser so that it
displays UTF-8. And if installing a font is required, I need to figure
that out as well. I suppose I will have to give instructions for IE,
Firefox and Opera, on the three main platforms, Windows, Linux and Mac.
If anyone knows of a site or resources to help me get this together, it
would be appreciated.

2) I need to learn web programming sufficient to do this project. While
at the mall today I stopped at Barnes and Noble and browsed through a
couple books on website creation. They were "for dummies" books. I was
able to understand them, but they were aimed toward creating a
commercial site with a shopping cart and stuff. Can anyone give me a
hint where to start for the kind of site I want to create? Books to
start with? Websites with tutorials for beginners? And on this topic,
what kinds of programs do I need to use (Linux, of course)?

Message-ID: <200612102013.54893.carla@bratgrrl.com>

hey all,

My google-fu has failed me- Asterisk gives three choices for the format for 
recording voicemail files: wav49, gsm, and wav. wav49 is GSM-compressed wave- 
both it and gsm are highly compressed, about one-tenth the size of wav files, 
and are good-enough for voice recordings. wav is the best sound quality, but 
it's way too fat. I'd like to use just wav49.

What I'm having trouble finding out is what client systems support them? wav 
is everywhere, but is wav49 well-supported on Linux and Mac OSX? Can OSX and 
windoze play gsm files without major tweakage?

thanks!

I've never heard of a wav49 format, but maybe I can help, and learn
something in the process. My Windows 2000 desktop (which I rarely use
anymore) has RealPlayer that I deliberately installed, but otherwise
has just standard stuff that came with Windows. Send me a wav49 file,
I'll move it to the Windows 2000 desktop, double-click on it, and we'll
see what happens.

Okay, I got one.  Important learnings:

1)  It does just fine in a washing machine - double washed.  However,
I made the mistake of anchoring it inside my blue jeans with a safety
pin, and the stress of that broke off the little end bit with the hole
to hold the anchor loop.  So it is now 1.2 inches long instead of 1.34
inches long!

The break revealed the potting compound - the device is well embedded
in solid plastic, appearing to be the same sort used for integrated
circuit packages.  The seal was not compromised, so the data storage
is not affected.  I will keep using it, but ...

2) There are two kinds of Superstick - the regular (white) and the
Superstick Pro (blue).  I have the regular.  It reads very quickly,
tens of megabytes per second, but it writes ever so slowly - maybe
eight megabytes per minute.  So a 2GB regular Superstick takes hours
to write!  The Superstick Pro claims to write at 13MB/second, almost
100x faster, and one review I've seen supports this.

3) There do not appear to be any domestic sources of the Superstick
Pro;  they are only available in Taiwan and Hong Kong.  That may
change over time, but if anyone wants the fast ones now, they will
have to find a way to import them.  Pat Heiden of PCH Cables imports
a lot of stuff from China, perhaps we can talk him into getting some.

And checking the P.C. Club ad at:
http://www.pcclub.com/product_details.cfm?itemno=A4302099

... it claims the write speed is 11.5MB/sec , about 100x what I
observed.  So either I am doing something wrong, or the ad is wrong.

It reads very fast, so I would guess my USB drivers are working fine.
Perhaps there is something special in the way it needs to be written,
and the standard Linux drivers write this device too slowly.

The only thing that springs to my mind is "block size".  How are you
writing to the device?  Well, that and "does the underlying device
need to clear a block prior to writing".  But this is based only on a
vague understanding of how Flash works.

John-
You could do this in any number of languages. My personal preference is PHP
because its easy and quick to learn. Most of the books @ Barnes and Noble
are a good fit (O'Reilly especially) .. I'm beginning to learn Ruby which
has built in Ajax support so you could make the site really spiffy if you
wanted to go that route, or python which has a nice web-tutorial so you
don't end up spending any money http://www.diveintopython.org

I'm not sure about the character encoding. I'll do some research and see
what I can come up with :-)

People

The drama continues...

The ip on the wan interface of my dsl box is not the ip that shows up when I
ssh out to a remote box..

How do they do that?

Is that normal..

I was expecting to see the wan ip on the box I sshed to?

TIA

Here is something I ran across the other day. I haven't had a chance to dive
into it but it may be helpful.

Some ISPs do a NAT on their network prior to connecting to the public internet.
check what your public IP address is being mapped to by going to
http://www.portforward.com/
It shows up at the bottom of the page.

How are you able to determine the 678's IP address at all?  (e.g.
'show int wan0-0' shows the Destination IP -- not the router's IP)

One way to determine your IP address is, from inside your LAN, go to
one of the many free (free-as-in-advertising) "What's My IP Address"
sites, such as: http://www.ipaddressworld.com/

Wait a minute.

The wan ip is a 207.xx.xx.xx number.....

Why would they nat that...

But the number portforward shows is 216.xx.xx.xx

I  am confused..

There are lots of DSL ISPs.  You aren't stuck with one that doesn't
meet your needs.

For a dynamic IP the comand 'set ppp wan0-0 0.0.0.0' is appropriate.
In other words, there isn't a way (that I'm aware of).

That's why I recommended viewing your IP address from one of those web
sites.  It just might work.

Fine, but being superbly reliable isn't always the deciding factor.
Show me a USB memory stick with 2 megs of capacity for 50 cents. 
Try shredding a USB key.  Applications where a floppy disk and drive 
are still attractive to me, running etherboot.  A bootrom that plugs
into the network card is an ideal solution, but that is generally an
expensive road to go down.  Unless you have PXE on an Intel mobo, it's
pretty hard to add on-motherboard/on-nic chip based network booting for
the cost of a floppy drive and a box of disks.

USB flash memory devices do not work on old computers and some
computers, such as an Alpha PC164 which takes 72 pin FPM simms,
seemingly can't be upgraded to support USB.  I tried buying a USB2 pci
card and installing it to my Alpha, it didn't work.  Even if it had, the
firmware on that machine doesn't support USB booting and the add-in card
I tried which is in use on another machine doesn't either.

USB is something that hasn't been around since day 1, sometime in the
early 80's when the first IBM-AT was sold.  Floppy drives have existed
all along.  USB hasn't even been bootable from day 1.  On an FIC VIA
Va503+ motherboard, even after upgrading the bios, booting via a USB
device is not supported.  I don't think there is a card that can be
added to an older PC to support both USB and usb booting.  The
disappearance of floppy drives is a fairly recent phenomenon.

In the interest of a no moving parts solution, I don't want to
substitute CD booting for floppy booting.  Between scratching disks 
and burning out the laser, the floppy disk approach to running 
etherboot is probably both more reliable and cheaper.

Now, concerning the floppy controller.  It's a low speed controller that
you wouldn't want to access say a 100 megabyte media device with.  You
really wouldn't want to run a zip drive for example off a floppy
controller.  A highly reliable device that emulates a 1.44 meg floppy
drive with a write protected disk loaded will probably work on any PC
all the way back to the 8086 if it plugs into a standard floppy
controller.  Such a device would be a nice option for people who want to
convert pre PXE PC's into network booted terminals inexpensively.  It's
hard to find the right bootrom for old network cards let alone get them
programmed right.  A device that emulates a floppy drive with 0 spin
up time would be faster than a real one.

$20 disposable cell phones have flash memory in them, the memory chip
is not the whole cost of the phone.  There is an LCD display, keyboard,
circuit board, etc.  I want cheaper flash memory options for IBM PC
compatible computers which work on both USB and pre USB systems.

Are there any flash drives that plug into the IDE controller as ATAPI
devices which look like a cdrom?  Va503+'s can boot from ATAPI cdrom
drives.

OK...

I know what my ip is....


216.xx.xx.xx

ON the box I can do


ssh  me at localhost..

I am in....


If I ssh out.. to a remote box..

>From that box I go..


ssh me at 216.xx.xxx.xx

It just hangs..

No error message..

just hang

I  can ping..

216.xx.xx.xx

That works..

after waiting I get

ssh:  connnect to host 216.xx.xxx.xx port 22; Operaton timed out..

Have you checked for firewall rules that might be on the box you're
trying to log in to?  It may be configured to allow connections only
from the local network.

Things to check:

Disregard 'show nat' (it's been a while).

show nat

Subject: [PLUG] Run a simple script at KDE startup
Message-ID: <457DA643.8050401@dslnorthwest.net>

Since setting the display power-off time is broken in systemsettings, I want to
run xset 0 60 120 when KDE is started.

Below is from KDE FAQ, with my comments.  Does the mismatch between what is
described in the FAQ and my system mean that the FAQ is out-of-date?  Does
anyone here know where I should place my little script so that it runs during
start-up?  I would prefer that it run for all users, but I can live with it
running just for a specific user.

Thanks,

-Denis

FAQ: How do I run a program at KDE startup?

There are many ways to do that. If what you want to do is to run some scripts
that would set some environment variables (for example, to start gpg-agent,
ssh-agent and others), you can put these scripts into $KDEHOME/env/ and make
sure their names end in .sh. $KDEHOME is usually a folder named .kde (note the
period at the beginning) in your home folder.

In my system, no ~/.kde/env exists.  ~/.kde does, but it contains 5 folders:
tmp-R2D2, socket-R2D2, share, cache-R2D2, and Autostart.


If you want scripts to be executed for all KDE users, you can put them under
$KDEDIR/env/, where $KDEDIR is the prefix KDE was installed to (you can find
this out using the command kde-config --prefix).

In my system, $KDEDIR is /usr.  No directory /usr/env exists either.

OK, looking at my own setup:
/ets/hosts.allow
[removed for clarity]
sshd: ALL

/ets/hosts.deny
ALL: ALL

(And appropriate /etc/iptables/iptables.rules -- but you're using the defaults)

Thanks, Jon.  I found that the default values are stored in 
$HOME/.kde/share/config/kcmdisplayrc.  I can change them there.  However, my 
monitor does not power off.  It goes blank, but I expect that just shuts off the 
beam, no power savings.  I get the Energy Star logo, but I guess that is just 
advertising.

Actually, in my book, any solution with a 25% failure rate is not a
solution. It's a money wasting disaster, waiting to happen. I have 45 people
depending on the machines I manage. If they can't work, we're losing
thousands of dollars per minute.

Show me a USB memory stick with 2 megs of capacity for 50 cents.


The reliability factor is EXACTLY why this is a poor argument. Sure, you can
say you can buy hundreds of floppies, but if the machine doesn't boot, how
much is your time worth?

Try shredding a USB key.


A garbage dispoasal works well. Or the heel of your boot.

Why not use a PCI PCMCIA slot, with a small PCMCIA memory card in it? That
should work even in your alpha.

As far as a "no moving parts" sollution, neither the floppy nor CD solution
qualify. For that, you have to have no moving parts.

And here we get to the real issue. If you are running 20 year old hardware,
then you have to expect to use 20 year old technology.

Don't fault the rest of us that have updated hardware for your hardwares
shortcoming. If it doesn't work for you because you haven't (or won't)
upgrade, that's not our issue.

Yup, I used t have a couple of 160k floppies around here somewhere... OH
WAIT.. I got rid of that drive...

Again, you are asking for features that were not designed into the product.
I don't believe booting from USB was part of the spec. It was added later.
That's what technology does. It moves on.

  I don't think there is a card that can be

No, because booting from USB requires that the BIOS know how to do that.
Either the native motherboard BIOS would have to know what booting from USB
is, or the add on card would have to replace part of the system BIOS.

As I said, neither of these qualify as "no moving parts".

Why not? I did that for years. It worked well. Iomega sold millions of the
zip drives that plug into the floppy controller. Some even held 250
megabytes.

One acronym: PCMCIA.

How about PCI? There are lots of PCMCIA slot cards that plug into the PCI
bus. Oh, but wait, the PCI but isn't available on an 8086 computer...

Well...

Good news and bad news....

Power  Company killed the power to the house.

So my computed went down....

When the power came back on later....

After I had changed /etc/hosts.deny and /etc/host.allow

It works.....

And of course I have a new ip...

Because of  doing a dhcp...


Thanks for all the help..

I spoke to soon.  The hardware is fine.  A dual-boot to Windows ME shows that 
the system can in fact power-down the monitor under program control.

Anybody have ideas of where to look? xset dpms force off does not power the 
monitor off--it merely blanks the screen.  There are many comments on dpms 
problems in KDE and Gnome, but none seem to be inability to power the monitor 
off--they deal with the time of inactivity and how to set it.

<And also to Aaron, re Ruby>

OK, I checked Synaptic on my Ubuntu amd-64 Dapper computer. It lists
the following (* means it was already installed, probably as part of
the Dapper default installation, or else something else I installed
required it):

* ruby (installed version says 1.8.2-1)
ruby1.6
ruby1.6-dev
ruby1.6-elisp
ruby1.6-examples
* ruby1.8 (installed version says 1.8.4-1ubuntu1.3)
ruby1.8-dev
ruby1.8-elisp
ruby1.8-examples
ruby1.9
ruby1.9-dev
ruby1.9-elisp
ruby1.9-examples
rubybook
ruby-elisp
ruby-eserver
rubyfilter-doc
ruby-gnome2
ruby-manual
ruby-pkg-tools

So if I want to use Ruby, which of the above should I use? Dunno why I
have 1.8 xx installed when there seems to be a 1.9 available. I ran
Update Manager and it did not show any new version available, although
in the past I have seen Ruby this-or-that listed in Update Manager. I
suppose I need some of the extras too. 

I read the first of the tutorials referenced on the site Aaron
mentioned. It said it was for beginners. But I stopped reading it when
it said it assumed basic knowledge of programming. After that it
started getting confusing. :( 

I'm thinking that I should start with the basics of how to create a web
site *without* Ruby, etc. I created http://www.web.pdx.edu/~johj by
fumbling my way with OOo Writer and exporting to html. Perhaps what I
need is a basic web design tool, Frontpage-like. To that end I searched
in Synaptic, found nvu and installed it. It seems to be able to handle
Java, but there is no reference to Ruby or PHP or anything else. I need
something where I can place controls on the page and link them to lists
or database tables.

Just for kicks I took the original Writer document that I previously
exported as an editable PDF (I posted it on
http://www.web.pdx.edu/~johj), and exported it from OOo as an HTML
file. When I dropped the HTML file on Opera, curiously, the radio
buttons, check boxes and text field all worked. The controls on the
first two pages did not. That is no doubt because they were linked to
an OOo database. I may be closer to a solution here than I thought. :)

> I'm not sure about the character encoding. I'll do some research and see

The character encoding issue can wait a bit. First I need some real
basic stuff. I did find a web design book at B&N Sunday (can't remember
the title, had "cookbook" in it) and it had several pages on the font
encoding issue. I'd have bought it but it was $40 and this was the only
part I found useful.

The 2.6 kernel is related to the problem.  It turns out that the new
USB drivers do something called "sync" mounting, apparently protecting
the USB device from data corruption.  That's fine, but it works
REALLY SLOWLY with vfat file systems.  If I mount the file system
without sync, then write speeds are still a miserable 470KB/sec,
but at least not the hopelessly pathetic 130 KB/sec.  Read speeds
are 14.7MB/sec .

I tried reformatting the drive with ext3, and it behaved very badly.
I suspect the key contains FAT-oriented "optimizations".

Okay, closest you're going to get is 32MB keys. If you buy them in bulk I
imagine you might be able to find them for $2.50 per. That is
significantly cheaper than the floppy drive and floppy (and a lot more
reliable).

If shredding for data destruction is key, then got for optical media. The
QC for them is starting to drop as well, but they've got a lot more space
and are more reliable than floppies at this point. I'll note that there
are paper shredders that are explicitly capable of shredding optical
media, but there aren't any that are capable of shredding floppies (the
metal would be a problem).

Haven't seen them advertised in large numbers, but if you're truely
dealing with that many, it shouldn't be a problem to get a batch of cards
which include ROMs. Small (spacewise) keyfob plus USB controller will be
cheaper than the floppy drive and floppies.

Well, the VA-503+ most certainly supports booting from optical media, I
have to imagine the Alpha does too. The disappearing of floppies most
certainly isn't a recent phenomenon. Apple did it first somewhere in
1998-2000, though floppies had already been losing favor due to their
lack of space. 5 years isn't recent.

For that matter, you can also simply purchase a modern hard drive for
your Alpha and transport data on that. Not cheap, but IDE works on most
older systems...

Ha! The optical drive will be massively more reliable. I've seen lots of
floppies die, not nearly so much optical media. With the optical media
and no contact, once you know the media is good, it will work for years.
With the physical contact needed with floppies, that disk will be slowly
wearing out. Reliability massively favors optical media. Further, with a
small number of systems the price differential is minimal; with many
systems the cost in time is so much lower that optical is a massively
better deal.

They generally look like hard drives to software. They're around though
I haven't gone looking recently.

CF+ide adaptor is becoming a very affordable ($10 for the card, $10-$20 
for the adaptor at newegg) option.  AFAICT, it boots just like a hard 
disk.  For the number of times that I have to actually boot from a 
floppy vs the amount of headaches involved in getting a good floppy, 
I'm thinking popping open the case and plugging in one of these would 
be a better option for the old boxen.  Not to mention that you can fit 
a lot of utilities in 256MB.  Maybe even just get the 1GB card and use 
it as your boot/root partition (though /tmp, /var, etc all need to live 
elsewhere.)

Though I've never used it personally, I've heard several trusted
sources say that Rails is great for getting a small-to-mid size app
running very quickly, and with relatively little code.  They even have
24 Hours of Rails competitions, where teams compete to see who can
crank out the best Rails app in a single day.  And, as you can see,
there is lots of help online for Rails.

Definitely start with the fundamentals.  Without some understanding of 
HTTP's GET/POST and CGI/servers (apache), creating web applications in 
any language will be difficult.  Once you've successfully checked your 
bank balance with telnet, you should be good to go :-D

Perl as CGI might be a good place to start, particularly since you could 
basically just point the POST from your OOo exported html to it.  Also, 
before diving into Rails, you might want to look at http://jifty.org/.

Also note that with any web application framework, you'll probably need 
to do at least some amount of SQL wrangling.  I think jifty pretty much 
eliminates that, but of course it will still give you enough rope to 
shoot yourself in the foot.

Also note that you can just point the POST from your form at an e-mail 
address and grade the assignments manually (provided that your students 
have a mail agent available.)  Along those same lines, a canned cgi 
mailer (preferably one that isn't exploitable as a spambot (read "not 
php")) would probably suffice for your needs.

I've used them with Soekris systems, which actually has the CF+IDE built
on to the board, but I've never thought to use them for
maintenance-booting.  32MB is often enough and if you've bought a
digital camera and upgraded the CF, you've already got the space
necessary.

This place also sells the boot ROMs for a lot of common NICs for
$15-$18: http://tinyurl.com/y94ap7

I was just talking with someone else about Jifty, who confirmed my
suspicion that it suffers from the same PITA as Jesse Vincent's other
project, RT--it requires 10,000 CPAN modules and will only work with
versions released last week.

It's not just PHP; I've written adequately non-spambot-friendly mailer
scripts in PHP.  Remember Matt Wright w/Matt's Script Archive?  All icky
Perl, most exploitable in some way or another.  The stupid mistake to
avoid is not taking the recipient from the form, even as a hidden field.
Hard-code it in the script or use a configuration file or something
else, just as long as a remote user cannot tamper with it.

Tail end of a discussion of how to enable and control powering off my monitor. 
(Kubuntu dapper on a desktop):

 >Paul, Thanks so much for the help.  I think I am getting close.

 >-Denis

One step forward, one step back.  I put the Option "DPMS" in xorg.conf. 
/var/log/Xorg.0.log shows one entry of dpms off, followed by another showing 
dpms on,  xset dpms force off causes the monitor to power down. Good.

$HOME/.kde/share/config/kcmdisplayrc now has entries:

[DisplayEnergy]
displayEnergySaving=true
displayPowerOff=3
displayStandby=2
displaySuspend=1

However, xset q says:

DPMS (Energy Star):
   Standby: 1200    Suspend: 1800    Off: 2400
   DPMS is Enabled
   Monitor is On

This looks similar to a bug which lots of people have complained about in KDE, 
Gnome, and perhaps Debian.  (Times get multiplied by 60.)  It has been around 
for some time, and no one seems to take ownership of it.

So now I need a place to put a little script using xset to get the times set 
correctly. Jon Scully suggested I create a new directory ~/.kde/env, and (I 
suppose) put my script in there.

This is painful for a newbie.

Kind of off-topic question.

I had a friend ask me to recover a "ahem" MS-Word document when Word
crashed, from a usb key.  The word "save files" seemed to only be hard
drive files, and I recalled that Word ( and other Windows programs)
only "auto-saved" work that was on the hard drive. When I was a lab
manager for a bunch of windows computers, I had to coerce the students
to copy their files from their zip disks to the hard drive before
working on them, specifically because of this. 

Am I right to link the two thoughts? Should she copy files from the USB
key to the hard drive before working on it?

That, and apparently many of them have neglected to terminate the 
headers before including the posted data (at least judging by the 
amount of "Content-Type" and "Mime-Version" lines that get posted to my 
contact form.)

I've been able to access all those options by right-clicking on a
misspelled word.

I'm not sure how you go about removing words from the dictionary (if
you add them on accident, for example) but I'll cross that bridge when
I get to it..

Did you edit the file directly, or was it created by the KDE
"Configure Desktop..." control panel?

Those numbers look reasonable. xset deals with seconds, while the KDE
control panel works with minutes. If you did edit kcmdisplayrc by
hand, then it's not surprising that the values xset reports don't
match. For a manual edit to work properly, you'd likely have to logout
of your KDE session, then edit the file, and log back in. If you make
the changes via the KDE control panel, it will automatically update
the X server.

That's how it works on a windows machine.. The only things related to 
spelling that show up in my right click menu are to turn the spelling on 
and off and to select a dictionary to use, nothing about suggestions or 
additions.  Twiddling all of the options in about:config with "spell" in 
them makes no difference.

Let me separate what I see as three separate issues. 1) How did I edit 
kcmdisplayrc, 2) The values reported by xset, and 3) The effect of using 
systemsettings.

I edited kcmdisplayrc using Kate, (invoked with kdesu).  Then I logged out and 
logged back in. Is this a problem?

The values reported by xset do not match the values in kcmdisplayrc.  To do so, 
they should be 60,120,180 seconds.  Where do 20, 30, and 40 minutes come from?

Using Systemsettings (the replacement for kcontrol) gives me only one time 
option, and as a result, sends the command xset dpms 60 60 60 (for a 1 minute 
time).  This does not work.  The screen goes blank at 1 minute, then turns back 
on at 2 minutes, and remains on.  And it reverts to the default values after a 
logout/login.  If I execute sudo kcontrol from a termminal window, I get errors, 
and no access to monitor power:

My suspicion (untested) is that KDE would re-write kcmdisplayrc upon
logout, leaving the file's contents the way it thinks they should be.
Have you checked kcmdisplayrc again since you logged out and back in,
just to verify that it's still the way you set it? If you really
wanted to hand-edit kcmdisplayrc, you would probably have to do it
while there is no KDE session running, in order to avoid having KDE
step all over your changes.

Probably the values that are set via KDE.

System Settings is an Ubuntu thing, IIRC? I'm not sure why it doesn't
offer the full complement of display power management settings. Can
you still right-click on the desktop and get to the "Configure
Desktop..." control panel? On my system, the "Display" section of that
control panel has a "Power Control" tab with options for standby,
suspend, and power-off.

You should be able to run kcontrol as a regular (non-root) user. If a
particular panel requires root privileges, it'll ask for the password.

It's dying because root cannot (without some trickery) run GUI-based
apps on a display belonging to a regular user's login. Just hit F2 and
run 'kcontrol' like any other app.

The kcmdisplayrc changes have stuck.

Now I check xset q (after a long idle time and a reboot) I see:

DPMS (Energy Star):
   Standby: 60    Suspend: 0    Off: 0
   DPMS is Enabled
   Monitor is On

However, if I end the current session, and then log on again, I get:

DPMS (Energy Star):
   Standby: 1200    Suspend: 1800    Off: 2400
   DPMS is Enabled
   Monitor is On

A second session end and re-logon results in the same report from xset  q.

This is the bug that others had talked about, I suspect. Some had reported 
increases on-going with each new log-in.

No power options are offered with a right click -> Configure Desktop.  The 
closest it comes is screen saver options.  I have never run Ubuntu, only Kbuntu, 
but they have quit a bit in common, AFAIK.

Yes, you are correct.  But the display -> power saving tab only offers one time, 
and it is set to 30 minutes (right now).  It could be that some helpful KDE 
programmer decided offering three times was too confusing for the likes of me, 
and just added and subtracted 10 minutes to get the other two times.  When I 
select something under 10 minutes, the planned simplification breaks. (In this 
test I did not make any changes, as I did not want kcmdisplayrc to get changed. 
BTW, I understand that Systemsettings combines kcontrol and some other things to 
put them all in one place.

parents at R2D2:~$ kcontrol

Perhaps, but my reading of the kdesu man page leads me to believe that it 
provides the trickery.  But no matter. it is not needed in this case.

I still think my best bet is to put xset dpms 120 180 300 (or whatever) in a 
script which runs after KDE has been run. (now that I have Option dpms set).  So 
where does it go, and how must it be named to do its thing?

This whole thing has been an education.  (The upside of unresolved bugs?)

Thanks again,

I'm sure if I'm wrong, someone will correct me.

As I understand it, LCD monitors have what is known as a Native resolution.
This is the resolution they are designed to run. If you run in any other
resolution, you are really just compromising, and forcing the monitor to do
something it's not designed to do.

Isn't that what he just said?  He was asking how to achieve the proper 
resolution.

Yes the original post did say that.  The OP was asking how to change _whatever_ so
other resolutions would look good.  Russ is stating that is not possible.

Native Resolution == As good as that monitor gets (hopefully great)
Anything Else == Sending your eyes to cacaville

OK, spent several hours last night at Powell's Technical Books. I
wasn't going for details, just trying to fill in some basics. I still
don't know what "CGI" means or "Perl as CGI," or "GET/POST" (quoting
Eric), nor do I know what Apache does, but at least I have a faint
understanding of the difference between server based v. browser based
scripting. And it appears the reigning server-based tool is PHP, while
Javascript is what is commonly used for browser-based scripts. 

There was a book about Ruby on Rails too. I browsed through it for half
an hour and I still have no idea what Ruby is or does. It went on and
on about what a great "framework" it is. OK, "framework" is a metaphor,
but a metaphor for what? As I said before, it seems to be installed on
my Dapper computer, but I don't know what to do with it. I typed "ruby"
at a command line and the cursor went to a new line, like it launched
something, but no GUI window popped up or anything. If it were a GUI
app I could poke around in it to see what it does. The online tutorial
also left me wondering what it is or does. 

At this point I think I need to make a basic decision: Do I want this
website to be server-based or browser based? I read about the pros and
cons of each, but input from web designers would be helpful here. To
clarify, I want to create a website that will be a place for students
to practice Phonetics and the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).
One page will have a list of written descriptions of sounds with a
drop-down or some kind of field to select the IPA character for that
sound. A counterpart page will have sound files instead of the written
descriptions. Another page will be the reverse, the IPA character with
option boxes to select the description of the sound. The latter will be
easier because none of the option boxes will have more that a dozen
features to select from. 

The first and second pages will be much more challenging because they
need to allow the student to enter the correct character, and there are
over 100 of the base characters, plus a dozen superscripts and a couple
dozen combining diacriticals, plus a handful of additional symbols for
marking things like vowel length. That's a damn big drop-down list. In
addition, the number of possibilities is kind of geometric -- any of
the base characters can be modified by any of the superscripts or
combining diacriticals. This is getting out of hand! (In case you're
intereested, for a full view of the IPA chart, go here:
http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/IPA/fullchart.html.)

I like Aaron's idea of using an image of the characters to click on
instead of a drop-down select box. This could appear at the top of the
page. When a student clicks on a character, that character is filled
into the field where the cursor currently is. But there are a lot of
characters and the display will take up a good chunk of the page.
Still, this would have a great advantage: Some of the sounds might need
up to three characters; a base character, a combining diacritical, and
a superscript. For example, a [t] pronounced with the tongue against
the back of the teeth (as in Spanish, not as in English) would have the
dental combining diacritical under it, and if it is aspirated it would
have a superscript h after it.

Since this is a site for students to practice, I need to tie it to a
database table with a list of sound descriptions in one field and the
correct character(s) in another field. Or for the second page with
sound clips, the sound files and their corresponding character(s).  I
want the page to display, say, 50 sounds. But I want to create a
database of 2-300 sounds and their character(s), so that the page will
display a random selection of 50 at a time. A Refresh button would
present the student with an endless number of new pages to practice
with. And a Correct button would check the answers on the current
iteration of the page to the database to see if the student entered the
correct character(s). For each incorrect answer the correct answer
should appear, in red or some contrasting color. A nice touch would be
a percentage box telling the student their score for the current
iteration of the page. 

Another consideration is ease of access for students. I am continually
amazed at the computer illiteracy of fellow linguistics students. Does
everyone have a Javascript plugin on their browsers? If not, do I want
to tackle getting them to install one? Trust me, my fellow students
consider me a computer genius, and y'all know what an idiot I really
am. It has to be as plug and play as possible, and I want it to support
all platforms and all major browsers. This makes me think that
server-based would be much better. But what if a student in Lower
Balkistan using dial-up wants to use the site to practice? Is my site
going to be complex enough that bandwidth is going to create a problem?
I don't think so, but some of you pluggers have lots of experience
here, so your opinions are valuable.

OK, now that my goal is more clearly stated, should I use server-based
or browser-based? And which language should I use? Opinions, please.
And re the database, what should I use? MySQL? Something else? I am not
a database expert, but I have used in the past Paradox, MS Access and
the new OOo Base. I'd prefer the latter, because it's open source, runs
great on Ubuntu, and it's a GUI that is easy for me to use. I'm pretty
sure it can export to other formats, but which would be best?

Someone else suggested setting this up to transmit the student's work
to the professor by e-mail. That is something didn't think of, but it's
an interesting idea. For now, I just want it to be a practice site.
After I get the practice site working I should have enough knowledge
and experience to tackle the idea of using web pages for exams and
graded homework assignments. 

Oh, and a final thought. I have no intention of changing careers and
becoming a web designer. I just want to learn enough to accomplish this
goal. I'm a "learn as I go along" kinda guy.

Thanks for the suggestions so far. And if this is getting off-topic for
the list, tell me where to take it.

   This may be of interest to some of you. I've not validated the claims, but
merely pass on what was posted on a different mail list. I've never used
mysql (other than a brief fling trying SugarCRM), and I am very happy with
PostgreSQL and SQLite, so this does not affect me.

   Wasn't MySQL bought by Oracle last year? Hmmm-m-m-m.

"MySQL quietly deprecated support for most Linux distributions on October 16,
when its 'MySQL Network' support plan was replaced by 'MySQL Enterprise.'
MySQL now supports only two Linux distributions ?? Red Hat Enterprise Linux
and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. We learned of this when MySQL declined to
sell us support for some new Debian-based servers. Our sales rep 'found out
from engineering that the current Enterprise offering is no longer supported
on Debian OS.' We were told that 'Generic Linux' in MySQL's list of supported

Message-ID: <fac1adc70612130940s3cbccbe9na8c6aa7743975b6a@mail.gmail.com>

I have a person who has contacted me via the magic of the Internet who was
looking for some Linux help which I was able to provide. However, she also
has a question regarding..

* *I wanna install NS (Network Simulator) and it works better on older
versions of Linux
...I'm currently working a project involving VOIP networks...I wanna design
a model of a VOIP network using ATM as its backbone to use for simulation.I'm
doing performance evaluations in VOIP networks on parameters that affect
QoS( Quality of Service) in VOIP networks.Can NS 2 handle it?Or do you know
what I can use to design the model?

Is anyone here interested or able to provide any information regarding this
topic. This person is in the UK and if you feel like you could provide some
good feedback I'll get you in contact with each other.

Thanks,
A-

I would be interested in comments from anyone who has managed to get such a monitor working properly with Linux, for the display looks like the devil in any resolution other than the designated one.

(Disclaimer:  I learned to configure X when "gui app" meant xclock and
more than one terminal on the screen at a time... so there must be an
easier way to do things like add modelines / resolutions.)

Have you tried adding the correct resolution to the Screen section in
your /etc/X11/xorg.conf?  (If you open that file, you should see some
lines with a list of resolutions, "800x600" "1024x768" "1280x768" ...
etc.   Add a "1680x1050" in front of the left-most resolution to each
of these lines and try restarting X.)

If that doesn't work, you may need a modeline, which is beyond my knowledge.

No, MySQL wasn't.  Innodb, one of the data storage engines was purchased by Oracle.

MySQL uses a plugin architecture for db engines.  Innodb is not the only choice.

It handholds you through installing MySQL, creating a sample db and using it.

CGI -- Common Gateway Interface is largely what it's name says: It's a
gateway between the server and the remote browser -- ok it's a common
way to interface a server with a browser.  In reality it's a
communication protocol, like, B: "hello?" S: "hi" B: "hey, can I get a
file?" S: "what's the secret password?" B: "I don't know!" S: "just
kidding... what file do you want?" etc.

GET sends the request (the answer to "what file do you want" at the
end of the URL. Ever notice [www.site.com], then
[www.site.com?file=42]? The '?' part is followed by one or more
key=value pairs, sent to the server.

POST -- does virtually the same as GET, but uses FORM fields, such as
<input type="text" name="file" value="42" />, etc.

Apache is one of the more common web 'servers'.  When you install
Windows or a Linux distribution on some hardware, you don't always get
a web server with the package.  To get a web server going you can
install Apache (or any number of others).  You know what a web browser
is.  So it's a lot like some Unix/Unix-like distribution that don't
have a browser, when first installed.  You have to pick one (Firefox,
Opera, lynx) and install it.  The diference is, a server (like Apache)
is often configured by changing text files, instead of clicking
buttons in an 'Options' window, like with a browser.

PHP / JavaSript -- correct.

Ruby is an interpreted language, similar to PHP.  It's the 'framework'
(Rails) that has probably caused a lot of the hype around the
language.  The 'framework' really consists of just software.  It
auto-creates code (RUby code) in very convenient ways, taking much of
the drudgery out of developing a web site.  If you learn just the
framework and don't leran the language, two things will happen: First,
it will be a very exciting trip, to begin with.  You'll wonder how you
created so much, so fast -- especially if you're used to using, say
PHP and haven't used one of its miriad 'frameworks'.  Next, you'll run
into many limitations; some small; some not so small.  Then you'll
realize (eventually) that you really need to learn more about Ruby so
you can get into the guts of Rails and make your web site what you
intended it to be.

What did Mark Twain say? "The longest distance between two points is a
shortcut."  I think it was he.

If you're a seasoned programmer, you'll appreciate Rails (because you
know you can drop down to the Ruby level at any time and start
tweaking code).  If you're a beginner, you'll appreciate Rails a lot
-- but the honeymoon will be over pretty quickly.

Server based is unavaoidable.  Web pages get 'serveed' from a server.
What is also meant by 'server based', however is if there's any logic
happening on your web site.  Any forms being filled out?  You can
checkl the validity of an e-mail address, for example, when the form
contents are submitted (server-based) using, say, PHP or before it is
submitted (browser-based) using JavaScript.  If you're going to store
any of the information in a database (even in a file), that's also
considered 'server-based'.  Look at www.tiddlywiki.com for an example
of a 100% browser-based application (no server-based code required).

Then there's AJAX.  It's about as perfect a tool for creating dynamic
content as it is difficult to get "right" -- whatever that is.  But
it's really a matter of bringing 'server-based' and 'browser-based'
closer together.  Instead of loading a web page and re-loading web
pages for every button pushed or link clicked, AJAX ficilitates
providing just the information the end-user need, just when they need
it -- without a whole-page re-load.

Sounds like the first and second pages may benefit from some of the
problems AJAX can solve.

OK, back to work I go...  Haven't answered all your questions, but
should be a good start.

Oh, and a final thought. "I have no intention of changing careers and
becoming a web designer."  Ha!  [thinks back, fondly, of a simpler time] ;-)

By "reigning" for PHP, you mean "more books and more buzz because there's more

A website is *always* server-based.  Perhaps what you're trying to figure out

Perhaps you mean "web developer".  "web designer" is the person who spends
most of their time in Photoshop coming up with mocks, who then hands that
impossible layout to me for me to figure out how to do it with HTML and
Perl. :)

I have installed it on FC4 and FC5 machines without any real problems.  I used
the ns-allinone package version 2.29 and 2.30.  The 2.30 seems to have some
problems with the current version gcc installed on my FC4 box so I have stayed
with 2.29 for most of my work on doing testing.

The NS2 simulator is just that a tool to simulate networks and
interactions.  The
project has been around since ~1995 and has evolved.  The documentation
is somewhat sparse; geared for someone fairly good at understanding code and
will be extending the existing system to do something new.

In the 2.29 version it doesn't have any atm code in it.  VOIP is simulated using
udp traffic agents.  It is a very powerful system.  Don't expect to
understand it
all in just one reading and you will have to dive into the code.  It
took me about
two months of reading, asking questions and trying things until I understood
enough to accomplish my task.

The ns-users mailing list (and archives) some times has information
and I reply to it
helping get people up past the step after ./install.  It gives you a
lot to do that some
people don't understand if they don't program or use a Unix/Linux
environment on a
regular basis.  The wiki has pointers to most things.

   OK. Now that you mention it, I remember that.

   Anyway, it doesn't look like happy news for mysql users.

We've been using MySQL for our application for the past 3 years.  Our
customer's chose to purchase support, and never used it....

There will still be MySQL in the debian and ubuntu distributions, you
just can't buy support on these platforms.....

1. Learn SQL:

Those three books should cover all of the *major* SQL amd RDBMS  
basics. Once you know core SQL, MySQL is a breeze, and you can use  
their online docs for their particular weirdness at no cost:

At least not from MySQL AB anyways. I can see a company like Progeny

I haven't seen an official announcement, so I thought I would check.

Is there a Linux Clinic Sunday the 17th from 1-5pm?

Why yes, there is!

There will be a Linux Clinic from 1-5PM this Sunday!

As per usual, we will be performing a laying-on-of-hands for sick Linux
machines as well as helping people install, or even just play with
Linux.  If nobody shows up with things to fix, we might just end up
having cookies and coffee and swapping CP/M war stories.

It'll be at Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland, OR

Come on down!

Something else I thought of.

What resolutions are working?

Do you have enough memory on your video card to support the mode you are
trying?

Anybody coming to the Clinic who might have a Kubuntu Edgy installation CD so I 
can avoid the long downloads?  I can bring a few blank CD-R's to make copies.

Thanks,

How about the North Star Horizon running CP/M with just two 5-1/4"

   I saw a North Star once. I also remember when switching from CP/M to
DOS-1.0 that the latter did copies backwards. :-)

I am downloading it as I write this. Will burn to CD for you, plus I'll
leave the image on my hard drive in case anyone else needs one.

Jon,

   Don't know that I'm a wizard, but I've used the same ctrl-key commands for
about 25 years now. I've configured emacs and joe to use them, too. Yeah,
WS, Lotus-123, and dBase-II were the bigs apps then.

   The only problem with nostalgia is that's it's just not what it used to
be.

I used to write 6809 assembly code in Wordstar, in non-document mode of
course. On a Molecular Supermicro 32, a multiprocessor CP/M system. I
wrote the first backup program for that system, to copy the data off the
5M hard drive to the 8" floppy. That was in the early 80's. How many of
you were still scooping jello out of your diapers then?

About 10 years later I worked for a guy who was one of the Wordstar
developers. And strangely enough, he called me today about a contract.

Who really wants to admit to using those (or even remembering that)?

They were big heavy things and held up well (except for the floppy drives
losing their head alignment and not being able to find the holes on the
disks...)

Subject: [PLUG] ReactOS's ridiculous timeline...
Message-ID: <1165973748.20448.18.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Why do the ReactOS project planners plan to spend WAY too much time 
to get a stable release out?  They are developing a GPL'ed Windows XP
compatible operating system.  It's going to take them so long
to get to beta even, that I seriously wonder why they don't either
push for a more aggressive timetable or give up.  They are saying 
beta quality sometime between 2007 and 2008, but neither 0.4 nor 
0.3.1 have come out.  I guess they are not planning on getting to
a 1.0 release until 2009.

I'm curious, why is the foundation converting from being a U.S. based 
nonprofit corporation to being a company based out of Russia?

I admittedly am starting to wonder what the heck is going on with this
10 year old project.  If enough major companies get behind a GPL'ed
Windows compatible operating system, couldn't it be developed to a
stable level in less than 13 years?  What is the average timeline from
alpha to stable for producing a new operating system from scratch?

Let's look at Linux, it started about 1990 didn't it?  Let's say it
started in 1994, that was only 10 years ago where Linux is already
in arguably great shape as far as operating systems go.  

Is the ReactOS project ever going to speed up?

Here is their roadmap page.  I'm sorry, but this seems pathetic.

Subject: [PLUG] Default gnome setup...
Message-ID: <1165985607.20448.71.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

On Fedora 1-5 and CentOS 4.x systems, the default gnome configuration
has shortcuts to system configuration utilities and what's worse, any
user can trigger a system shutdown from their gnome session.

Beyond gnome, is there a standard way to set up X in general, regardless
of the window manager used, so that shutting down or restarting the
server X is running on isn't an option unless you have the root
password?  Is there a way to use customized gnome defaults when creating
new accounts?  How do you control which users can become root in an
X session?

If multiple people are logged in to the same X server...  it may be that
none of these people should be able to shut the server machine down on
everyone.  Consider user a selecting shutdown or restart in gnome
instead of logout causing user b to suddenly lose openoffice and
user c to be dropped from a gimp session.  An exception, the ups daemon
should be able to pull the curtain on everyone in rare instances, but
only an authorized user should be able to pull the curtain otherwise and
everyone should be warned prior.  

On a console only system, root can do  
"# wall "System is going down in 15 minutes..."

So what do you do on a graphical system running X???

How fast are they compared to hard drives?  

Is there any reason that the data in var and tmp on a typical Linux
system needs to persist when the system is shut down?  Wouldn't it be
lightning fast to have a card that takes standard memory, plugs into a
PCI slot, and then load /var /tmp and the swap partition into that?
There's something about backpack solutions battery backed ram in the 2.6
kernel config if I remember correctly.

Here's what I've seen on Newegg so far:


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SYBA SD-CF-IDE-A IDE to Compact Flash Adapter - Retail
     
Pros: Worked out of the box with IPCOP (Linux Firewall) on a Dell. No
configuration necessary. Using a 512MB compact flash card which was
correctly detected by the BIOS. It didn't work with the stock Dell cable
which has one of the IDE plugs filled. A new cable fixed it.

Cons: Has no protection so you'll have to find a good safe place for it.
We're going with an anti static bag and double stick tape.

Other Thoughts: Runs cool to the touch after some pretty heavy load.

Pros: fast shipping.

Cons: no dma support as it uses cf cards. not seemingly compatible with
the full ide spec, as no cylinder/head/sector information was available
to the kernel. caused repetitive crashes when writing in netbsd,
freebsd, slackware, dsl, etc etc etc. this is not the product i expected
it to be.

Other Thoughts: disappointed.

Pros: Easy install; useful function; compact; works as advertised

Cons: very poor performance. With a super fast 150x CF card I am only
able to get 3500KB/sec transfer rate. Card should be encapsulated to
prevent shorting components on case. Minimal docs.

Other Thoughts: This is a great idea but I'd like to see much better
performance. Also, it should have come with slot mounts since it does
have holes in the board for slot mounting the card.

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822998002
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYBA SD-CF-IDE-BR IDE to Compact Flash Adapter (Bracket Version) -
Retail


Pros: compact, flexible installation

Cons: doesn?t accept more than 1GB CF, also it doesn?t fit in a 44IDE
cable or ATA133 cable

Pros: Small. Looks like it would be a great product if the 44 pin
connector wasn't left off.

Cons: Contrary to what someone else said here this item will NOT take a
44 pin cable out of the box. There is a place on the board for a 44 pin
connector, but it is "optional". I guess I will have to return it.

Pros: This adapter requires a 44 pin IDE cable, works great!

Cons: none

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16812186002
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYBA SD-CF-IDE-DI IDE to Compact Flash Adapter ( Direct Insertion Mode )
- Retail

Pros: this device works very well for a nice m0n0wall router, a nice
alternative to using a hotter hard drive, with the heat where I live.

Cons: using an ASUS board (AMD64), sometimes the bios would spend a
little too much time auto-detecting the device, but in the VAIO (PIII)
in which it now resides, it works splendidly.

Pros: has jumper settings, unlike some other models ive dealt with.
small form factor. device works just like it should.

Cons: only complaint is the ide connector - plugs down right into a
board. cannot use an ide cable for placement where you might want/need
it.

Pros: Works great for a m0n0wall router I put together using a cheap CF
card and an older pII PC.

Cons: IDE connector was not keyed like the picture.

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822998003






Hmm, these reviews are contradictory.  Why is the IDE connector oriented
differently on the last one than it is on the other two?  Not accepting
over a 1 gig flash card is not a problem, I'm trying to replace a just
under 2 megs floppy disk.  On the last one, it's not keyed?!?!?  The
first one I listed, what is the crashing issue all about?  It shouldn't
show CHS if it's supposed to pretend to be an Atapi CDRW drive, should
it?  So which one is the best?  Is it possible to get scsi-2 or scsi-3
to CF readers that are better than these three?  I like the price of the
first one, $10.99.  I don't want slot mounts, I want to hide this inside
the case.  I'm planning on using one of these to get etherboot going,
that's all, so will they all work for that?  Can these CF cards be
partitioned so that you can install say a local copy of Freedos and
etherboot?  I wonder if I can network boot linux by installing freedos
to a flash card and using loadlin.

Our motherboards have at least a 2 meg flash chip on them anymore
these days, don't they?  Why hasn't someone cleverly found a way
to build a simple circuit to allow plugging one of these
flash chips into the floppy or IDE controller?  Can I get an ISA 
card with a programmable flash rom on it to install etherboot to?  
A lot of expansion cards, even today, have a bios on them.

How do I install etherboot to a flash card?

BTW:  I've only heard of 40 and 80 pin IDE cables, where did 44 pin come
      from???

One thought, an Atapi cdrom drive is only $20.  There is a moving parts
issue, but CD-R media is only 30 cents a disk.  Two problems, I can't
run the machine on it's side anymore and getting bumped becomes an issue
if I add a cd drive.  One of the advantages of being
diskless, or close enough, is that your system is either highly
resistant or completely immune to getting bumped.  I worry about
moisture and temperature variations in the uninsulated shed
where I have this machine.  Right now, the disk drive probably 
isn't affected much.  The machine is dry and I figure that the cold
air is probably good for it.  I can still get 25 floppy disks for $10.
If I put etherboot on all 25 of them, I can handle a lot of failures.
Considering that the floppy drive only has to be used to get the machine
booted, I'm really not seeing the reliability issue become a major
problem.  I think floppy drives use less power than cdrom drives.

   CONFIG_FB_VGA16=m, CONFIG_FB_VESA=y, and CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y are also

   Do I need to explicitly set CONFIG_FB_VGA16 to 'y'?

Did you set the VGA mode from the kernel command line?  Try vga=ask next
time you reboot.

Rich and PLUG...

The 2.6.19.1 Kernel had a boat load of items changed. I personally would 
wait till many of the bugs are worked out of the release before using 
it. (Of course I experienced this the hard way, when my SATA system 
didn't boot because my system reverted back to hda status.... Grrr...

To answer your question... No, you shouldn't.

Piet,

   Well, since there's no 2.5.x development series, which 2.6.x kernel do you
suggest I try?

   The stanzas in lilo.conf are identical. No problem with the 2.4.33.4

Actually, according to my Structure of English textbook, the antecedent
needs to be in the same immediate clause only if the proform is a
reflexive. Elsewise, English allows it to be anywhere, even in
postposition removed. The caveat, however, is that the further distant
the antecedent the more likely ambiguity will result. But ambiguity is
the fun part of language. Without ambiguity much of humor would not be
possible. :)

I know you are trolling, but I could not resist.  They are trying to

but what the heck, a monopoly can do that.

Subject: [PLUG] Power monitor off (was Run a simple script at KDE startup)
Message-ID: <4580EB9C.4000902@dslnorthwest.net>

The plot thickens.

Reference to files:
#1: $HOME/.kde/share.config.kcmdisplayrc
#2: /var/log.Xorg.0.log
#3: /etc/X1/xorg.conf

Recently my monitor would not power off under program control.  I was told that
Option "DPMS" in file #3 under the Monitor section was needed to get the monitor 
to power off.  I added it and indeed the monitor powered off. (One test is 
"sleep 5; xset dpms force off; sleep 5")  Also, #2 shows dpms enabled.

I found that #1 has times for the power off.

It was also recommended that I use kcontrol to set the times. xset q lists what 
the times for monitor power are.  xset dpms t1 t2 t3 sets the times also, but 
those times do not survive a logoff.

My observations are that using kcontrol to set the time to 1 minute, for 
example, generates an xset dpms 60 60 60 command.  Those times do not survive a 
logoff either.  But it does generate a new file #3.  The new one does NOT have 
an Option "DPMS" in it, but the monitor still powers off.  I believe the reason 
is that the original file #3 had a DPMS off command somewhere, and my adding 
Option "DPMS" overrides. The new file #3 has no mention of dpms at all.

If I change the times in file #1, the values reported by xset q do not change, 
either immediately or after logoff/logon.  The values reported are 1200 1800 
2400, unless I run xset dpms ..., then they change as expected.

So my questions are,
What is the use of the times in file #1?  They appear to have no effect.
Where are the default times responsible for the 1200 1800 2400 values stored?
Where can I put a script to run an xset command automatically on logging in?
What is required of the file containing that script?

Any wisdom provided will be greatly appreciated.

-Denis

Something else I thought of.

What resolutions are working?

Do you have enough memory on your video card to support the mode you are
trying?





Actually, what happened (on SuSE) is that I was able to get the 1680 x 1050, but the sweep frequency was much too high (89 Hz, and I couldn't bring it down to the necessary 60 Hz). I made these adjustments with another monitor, of course!

On a 21" monitor, the Nvidia FX5500 will actually support 2048 x 1536. It's a better monitor than the new one, but the amount of space it takes up is a problem.

On FreeBSD, which is somewhat different, the monitor worked at 1600 x 1200 (VESA standard 4/3). It looked pretty good, too, but I was afraid that the overclocking would damage the monitor.

I'm stumped. All of my KDE systems (regular old Debian) allow me to
set the "standby", "suspend", and "poweroff" values individually via
the Display control pane, accessible from either the Control Center
(aka "kcontrol"), or the "Configure Desktop..." context menu item.
Any changes I make there are immediately propagated to the X server
(confirmable via "xset -q"), and are also immediately written to
kcmdisplayrc. All of the settings survive a logout. My best guess is
that something is broken about Kubuntu's KDE install, perhaps related
to the non-standard control panel applets.

Konqueror has a "Go->Autostart" menu option that takes you to a window
where you can "Edit->Create New->Link to Application...", and point
the new link towards a simple one-line shell script that contains your
preferred "xset dpms ..." settings. This will only be run for the user
whose account the link was created under. There's almost certainly a
way to have KDE execute the same script regardless of which user is
logging in, but I'm not familiar with it. There's also no guarantee
that KDE won't muck with the settings at some time after the script
has been run. You'll just have to experiment.

It seems that the "All-In-One Gestures" extension interferes with the 
display of suggested spellings, switching to the "Mouse Gestures" 
extension fixed the problem.

Does the following link give you any clues?  (I do not have the savvy to

The behavior I observe is different than described, but certainly could be related.

Try the stable 2.6.16.X that Adrian Bunk is maintaining:

Looks like .35 might be the current 'X':

Frustrating.  Is it an active bug or not?

I hope to be there, laptop and a couple of install DVDs in hand, hoping 
to find help in the way of an enlightened teacher, to show me the way of 
  fixing the small problems I have in this latest adventure, for

Aaron,

   No, I didn't.

   This evening I'll build the 2.6.16.36 kernel and see if that works
properly.

Thanks,

PLUG Advanced Topics meeting

Date:  December 18th 2006
Time:  7:00pm

Location:   Jax Bar 826 SW 2nd Avenue Portland, Oregon

Speaker:    Randal Schwartz

Topic:

When you have hundreds of people simultaneously patching 25000 files of 
the Linux Kernel in sometimes conflicting ways, you might need some scheme 
or plan to sort all that out before you can build your next kernel and 
reboot.  The Linux team uses "git" for their source code repository 
management, a homegrown solution that is optimized for highly distributed 
development, working with huge sets of files, merging independent work at 
multiple levels, and seeing who broke what. (Git has also since been 
notably adopted by the Cairo, x.org, and Wine teams, and is being 
transitioned to by the Mozilla codebase.) In my talk, I describe what 
"git" is and isn't, and why you should use it instead of CVS, Subversion, 
SVK, Arch, Darcs, Mercurial, Monotone, Bazaar, and just about every other 
repository manager.  I'll also walk though the basic concepts so that the 
manpages might start making sense. If I have time, I'll even do a live 
walkthrough, where you can watch how fast I make typos.

Standard meeting rules apply.  Happy hour meal prices for the duration of 
the meeting.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0612151456360.1289@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I just received a notice that my domain name registration expires next
March. The notice is from DomainDiscover and I've not before known of them.
They must have bought the provider I last used (and I don't recall who that
was because it was four or more years ago that I renewed.)

   There was an issue with GoDaddy.com not long ago if I remember correctly.
If folks here have recommendations on registrars I'll start the switch after
the first of the year. That should give them sufficient time to pry the
registration from DomainDiscover and put it in their database.

Be careful.  I routinely get "renewal notices" from companies other than 
my registrar of record.  They are attempts to get me to switch to their 
more expensive services via fraudulent notices.

Use whois to check who you are registered through if you don't remember.

I use dotster.com for mine.  They have worked pretty well and have DNS 
hosting via web page that has been fairly useful.

Better check first if DomainDiscover is a scam.  I have never heard of 
them.

gandi.net - the best EULA in the domain business.

Alan,

   I did this. DomainDiscover is the registrar.

   Thanks.

   I haven't either. But, they're apparently real.

   It seems like most of these companies make their money by selling
ancillary services. I just want to register the domain name. All my other
needs are accommodated by my ISP or me.

Carpe weekend,

Rich

I went through this exercise not too long ago.  I ended up choosing
dynadot.com.  The only thing I didn't like about them was that they
were in an EV1 net block, which led me to believe they were EV1
customers.  I also considered gandi.net, but decided to stay on
the continent.  I remember looking at domaindiscover, but I don't
remember why they didn't make the cut.

OK I have had a lot of problems with 1&1.com riping me off and stealing $100+ of my money and my bank was helpless to stop them. I have been with Godaddy.com and yes to begin with they are good but know nothing about keeping their servers going. GEOCITIES from yahoo knows what they are doing

I have used domainmonger.com for several years.  They are a sub of 
tucows.com, a popular Windows shareware site still around from the old 
days.  Not the cheapest, but they have a good record and good and easy

Perhaps the `gtf` utility will get the desired result?

Unlikely. Any resonably recent monitor (say post 1998 or so?) will reject

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0612160725430.1347@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   The mail log summary report script, 0pflogsumm, has been included in
/etc/cron.daily ever since I installed my MTA here. It ran daily up until a
few weeks ago. Then it stopped mailing the daily reports to me sporatically,
but the frequency of missed runs increased. For the past week it's not run
at all, despite my changing the prefix from '1' to '0.' All other scripts in
/etc/cron.daily run. Neither the postfix version nor pflogsumm have changed.
It runs when manually started.

   In the interim, I've edited crontab to explicitly run the script each
night. However, I'd like to try to understand why it may have stopped
running. Permissions on that file are identical to those on all other files
in that directory.

   Have any of you expert SysAdmins any thoughts on why a script in that
directory would stop running?

TIA,

Rich

   Thank you. Tucows has been around for decades. Way back when I was using
DOS I probably bought an application or two from them.

So it will run from /etc/crontab but not from /etc/cron.daily? Odd.

If you have an /etc/cron.hourly directory, try this:

1. Copy the script into /etc/cron.hourly.

2. Assuming it's a /bin/sh script (and not perl or whatever), add an
    invocation of env to the top of the script:

    /bin/env

3. Adjust /etc/crontab to run the revised script.

4. Compare the /bin/env output in crontab-run file to whatever appears
    in the cron.hourly-run file at the top of next hour.

Are there any significant differences (PATH, USER, ...) in the shell 
environment that look as if they might be significant?

If you've never seen one of the city of Portland's steam engines,
tomorrow(Sat. too) is a great opportunity to do so.  The SP 4449 will
be running between Oaks Park and the base of the Ross Island bridge.
The tracks run next to the Springwater Corridor trail.  Last
Sunday I rode my bike alongside the SP&S 700 engine.  Despite the
rain, it was a great experience.

Message-ID: <4584296C.2000108@acm.org>

I'm feeling ESR's pain.

I just upgraded from FC1 to FC6, actually reinstalled, so probably 
missed several configuration files.  One of those was for CUPS.  Of 
course what I was using was really bunged together so I was thinking I'd 
get a cleaner setup ... now.

Well it is cleaner and so clean I can't get even print a test page from 
my workstation to the Epson R300 on the TrendNET print server.  My 
wife's w2k system _still_ works fine so either my install missed 
something or there is some really strange network issue going on.

I've tried IPP, SMB, HTTP ( all of which the TrendNET supports ) plus 
CUPS lpd/lpr.
    No joy!

I keep getting errors about /var/lib/cups/backend/ipp|smb|lpr failed.

I thought I's read that CUPS would probe/find any network printers.  I 
can't find out how to do that.  This is after some serious time on the 
CUPS site and with google.com.

Anyone have some good hints/ideas/clue-sticks?


TIA,
Rod

Paul,

   It would not run. Period. Reading the script I see that it calls
pflogsumm.pl (which lives as /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm), but that was missing
the perl Date::Calc module. How, when, and why that got lost I've no idea.

   But, I used CPAN to get, build, and install that module (and some
dependencies that went AWOL), and I'm trying it now.

Thanks,

Rich

I can tell you with good authority that biking along side is likely to
be a Vastly More Interesting Experience(tm) than riding *on* the
train.  The boys and I did that last weekend, and we might as well
have been on an elevator, albeit one with nice windows.  We were
directed to the far end of the train, a nice old dining car, but the
only clue we had that the train was being pushed by a steam engine
were the occasional faint whistle toots, and the occasional vague
glimpses of steam far away when we went around curves.  I am glad to
have contributed to their fund-raising, but the ride itself could be
described in two words: "boon" & "doggle".  Or slightly more
verbosely: "45 minutes of my life I will never get back again."

Subject: [PLUG] In my CUPS again
Message-ID: <20061216172801.1cde278d.johnxj@comcast.net>

The current problem is that CUPS seems to have a limit of 100 copies
per print job. I've searched all the documentation I can find in order
to verify or refute this, but the documentation says nothing on the
subject. All I know is that no print job is created whenever I try to
print over 100 copies. No error message; just nothing happens. If there
is such a limit, it's insane. The number of copies I am allowed to
print is a matter for discussion with my paper supplier and banker, not
the computer software.

While researching the above problem I found some other interesting
stuff. For some time I have been trying to get jobs to print with job
offset from Adobe Reader 7.08. Adobe Reader does not seem to be aware
of CUPS -- for example there is no drop-down list of installed
printers. To print to my Laserjet-8000-Series-Postscript-(recommended)
printer I have to type in the following command:

lpr -P Laserjet-8000-Series-Postscript-(recommended) -# 100

I went to http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/options.html where I
discovered some syntax for other options. The syntax for job offset was
not listed, but it did suggest that "lpoptions -p
LaserJet-8000-Series-Postscript-(recommended) -l" would give me a list
of options for the printer. I was hoping that the command would then
list the official term for job offset, so I tried it. Unfortunately,
the command gave me:

jjj at Devil5:~$ lpoptions -p
LaserJet-8000-Series-Postscript-(recommended) -l 
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('

I should add that I can print with job offset from any other program,
including Kpdf. In fact, I'd use Kpdf all the time except that its
print speed is slower than the second coming. 

Does anyone know of an alternative command (lpr version of lpoptions?)
that might get me a list of options for this printer. I mean, I *know*
what options the printer has -- I've printed over 2.5 million copies to
it -- but I need to know what to call "job offset" from a command line.

TIA for any suggestions

Defaulting to 100 seems sane.  Not having a default limit would be 
insane.  Hey, it gives HP owners a reason to read the documentation and 
learn about the hardware limit before they go complaining about cups.

Anyway, the software will let you have up to two bytes worth if you ask 
nicely.

  http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/ref-cupsd-conf.html#MaxCopies

  "
  The MaxCopies directive controls the maximum number of copies that a
  user can print of a job. The default is 100 copies.

  Note: 

  Most HP PCL laser printers internally limit the number of copies to
  100.
  "

Now, limiting it to 100 in the hardware is maybe a little pathological.  
"But wait, we can sell more printers that way."  "Ok, let's make it 
20."  "No, that's just evil."  "100 it is"

Why not 255? (They've accumulated enough of my money from ink sales to 
completely bypass ternary computing and go straight to decimal.)

I believe you may have to run it through a postscript filter to apply an 
offset.  You might find something interesting in 'ps ax | grep gs' 
while running a job out of kpdf.  Not sure, but I think most filtering 
is done with ghostscript.  I think cups can be configured to apply a 
filter to a given printer profile (and lp probably does it with a 
command-line option too.)  In any case, for that one I bet you need to 
be looking into ghostscript filters and lp options, rather than cups 
configs.

Hmmm. On my Windows computer I have the PCL drivers installed. Just for
kicks I stepped over there and told Adobe Reader 7.0 to print 200
copies of a document to the PCL driver. The job sailed out without
complaint. 

Perhaps I have a different PCL version. Or perhaps the PCL limitation
is not set in printers that also have PostScript capability. Or
something. But I know that I have printed thousands of copies in a
single print job from my Windows computer and have never experienced a
problem. Hence my surprise that I was limited when printing from Linux.

Before your reply my googling efforts already turned up the MaxCopies
option. I just added it to /etc/cups/cupsd.conf. I suppose I'll have to
restart the computer before it will take effect and I can test it.

Thanks for the suggestion. I'm kind of puzzled by how this is supposed
to work. Before going further, I should explain what job offset is,
because I suspect a lot of people here may not know what I am talking
about. (Long story.)

Back in the mid-90s HP discovered that when office workers needed
multiple copies of a document they were running one copy out of the
laser printer, then walking over to a [insert competing brand] copy
machine, and making the rest of the copies there. HP decided to cash in
on the toner sales enjoyed by the copy machine people by making it just
as fast and pleasant to print all the copies on the laserjet. Now, most
laser printers of the day had an output tray that could hold maybe 500
sheets max. A copy machine, on the other hand, could be purchased with
a huge output tray (usually called a stacker). HP decided to go the
copy machine people one better by making it possible to eliminate the
collating step as well (envision the office secretary walking around a
table picking up copies to collate a report). 

One feature required for this was "RIP once, print many" technology (HP
calls it "mopying). Until that time when you wanted to print multiple
copies to a laser printer you got x number of copies of page 1, then x
number of copies of page 2, and so on. We're back to the secretary
walking around the table. HP fixed this by adding the ability to print
multiple copies collated. And in order to do that, they changed the
software so that the driver would send the file just once, along with a
counter for the number of copies. A laserjet with mopying capability
would image the job once, holding each page's image in the printer's
RAM, and then reprint from the printer's RAM for the required number of
copies. An advantage is that the first copy might print a bit slower
than the printer's rated speed, because of time lost in imaging each
page, but subsequent copies would print at the printer's rated speed.

And then, to beat the copy people completely out of the market, HP
(actually Canon, as HP bought all their laser engines from Canon)
engineered the output stacker to offset each copy by a few centimeters.
Not only did the secretary no longer have to walk around the table
collating big print jobs, but it was no longer even necessary to figure
out where each collated copy started and ended. 

OK, that's what job offset is. Now let me explain why I am so puzzled:

1) Job offset is an option that can be set from the printer's control
panel. I have it set to "on" as the default in the control panel. As I
understand it, this can be countermanded by the user when setting print
options, assuming the driver (PPD file) lists the option.

2) In Windows printer drivers, if I drill down deep enough, I find the
option to turn job offset on or off.

3) In CUPS the option to turn it on or off does not appear. The stacker
does appear as an "installed option" for the printer (although not in
all the drivers). But it just shows the stacker as an output option, as
opposed to the top output bin.

4) If I print from Kpdf the jobs come out with job offset. Note that
there is no option to turn it off in CUPS, so CUPS must be just sending
the job without saying anything about job offset one way or the other,
so I get what the control panel default is.

5) If I print from Adobe Reader 7.08 the only options in the print
dialog box are stuff like portrait/landscape, scaling, etc. There are
no options that would require Adobe Reader to have any idea what
printer it is sending the job to, that is, no printer-specific options
like paper trays, resolution settings, etc. That is (I assume) because
Adobe did not bother to make Adobe Reader aware of CUPS. There is no
drop-down list of printers. Instead there is a text box where I must
enter an lp or lpr command.

Now the part that puzzles me is, since my lpr print command says
nothing about job offset, why is the job not coming out with job
offset, since that is set as the default in the printer's control panel?

Printers are mysterious beasts.

You said I needed to be looking at lp options. I have done so, but
can't find any reference to job offset. And the syntax prescribed by
the documentation for discovering a printer's features (lpoptions)
gives me an error message. From the above it appears that lpr must be
turning job offset off by default. Otherwise the control panel default
would prevail. And if it turns it off, there must be a way to make it
stop doing that.

Thanks for the suggestions. I'll keep googling. Maybe eventually I can
figure it out.

Ah, totally different.  I thought you meant something to do with the 
page margin/edge offset.

Yeah, you need to be speaking directly to the printer.  Forget about 
ghostscript.

For non-kde programs, I tend to tell them to print to

  'kghostview -'

That assumes that they can pipe postscript to an external program like 
lpr.  kghostview will read it on stdin, then you can use that as your 
preview + printer control.

Which raises a question I had when reading your original post.  

Why do you want to print so many copies on your laser rather than one that is
then run through a copier?

Seems like a cheaper and faster option.

You want to avoid a bike commute along Springwater when that train is 
boarding. The people waiting in line don't seem to understand the 
concept of "right of way." Sigh. Dismount bike. Walk bike through 
60-foot-wide crowd. Say "excuse me" about 111 times. Remount and

I will be bringing a little printer to the clinic to fool around with
CUPS, and we can fix up your problem as well (though we will interrupt
the printer before it prints 100 copies!).

There is a file, /etc/cups/cupsd.conf on my machine, which sets this. 
The config line is about 200 lines down on my system:

   #MaxCopies 100

Which one can uncomment and change to:

   MaxCopies 1000000

... and kill a small forest.  CUPS will need to be restarted;  on my
Redhattish machine that is done (as root) with 

   service cups restart

and on a debianish machine that is probably

   /etc/init.d/cups restart

... although Ubuntu probably has a GUI that does the same thing.

When you think about it, changing such options should not be an easily 
accessable option for most people;  accidentally setting it very high
would make many people angry when they made a mistake, so it is proper
to require some text editor work to get there,  In any case, no
rebooting is required;  a properly set up Linux system only needs
rebooting when changing kernels or hardware or power sources.

BTW, folks should know that John authors and sells books on real estate,
and does print-on-demand, which is easier to manage with a laser printer
than with a copier.  Why he doesn't get a linotype and typeset with hot
lead in his basement I'll never know, but I suppose it is because Ubuntu
doesn't have drivers for 1890's technology.

I've been thinking about this a bit. It occurs to me that this is a
Windows v. Linux fundamental approach and attitude difference. Linux
was designed from the ground up as a server OS, so setting permissions
and maximums for users was considered logical. After all, the system
administrator would be highly pissed to discover that a secretary used
the office laser to run off a thousand copies of a personal resume to
use in looking for a higher paying job. Windows, on the other hand,
originated as a desktop OS, to be used on a standalone computer. In
fact, until Windows 3.1 Workgroup Edition, Windows wasn't even easily
networkable. Thus, the user of the OS *was* the system administrator.

My problem is that I am using Linux as a desktop OS on a standalone
computer. Therefore, I am always running into permission issues like
this that annoy me. But it's not a big deal once I figure out how to
give myself permission.

The standard way to install Perl modules from the source is:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Or, you could just let the cpan utility handle it.

cpan CPAN

1) I own the laser printers. I do not own a copy machine.

2) My cost per copy on the lasers is 1/4 of one cent for toner. No copy
machine can come anywhere close; the cheapest would cost three times as
much. The reason is because HP sold millions of the lasers I use, and
there are literally hundreds of aftermarket sources for toner (=
extreme competition).

3) All my copies are originals; using a copy machine would degrade the
print quality.

4) I need to make constant revisions. Keeping track of which is the
latest original set would be a problem. It's easier just to export to
PDF and overwrite the old PDF file.

perl -MCPAN -e'install CPAN' should download and install the latest
CPAN.  

If you're using debian, by the way, you might be interested in
dh-make-perl for building debian packages from CPAN (so you can easily
uninstall / upgrade them later).

   Thanks, Dave. I didn't realize that cpan would upgrade itself. Sorta'

Windowsthink. As somebody else said (and I am needlessly reinforcing 
here), restarting the CUPS daemon  --'/etc/init.d/cups restart' on 
my OpenSuSE machine -- should be all that is required.

Yes, CPAN works great for catching possible install problems, but not so 
great for what to do once the problems have been found.  I don't know the 
answer here, but the information on this page 
(http://search.cpan.org/src/PMQS/BerkeleyDB-0.31/README) might provide 
some insight. It won't directly solve your problem, though.  You might 
also consider contacting the current maintainer, Paul Marquess 
(pmqs at cpan.org).

   Thanks, Dave. It is so infrequent that I use CPAN I need to check the man
page for the proper syntax each time. Most situations are adding tools to
postfix.

   My problem now is that two perl modules (BerkeleyDB and Mail::SPF::Query)
fail one test each and will not install. I've no idea if the failed tests
are relavant to my need, nor how to handle this within CPAN. The BerkeleyDB
module is needed for postgrey (the grey listing addon to postfix), but I've
found what appears to be a better grey listing implementation so I am no
longer interested in that one. I do need the other module, however, and will
probably get the source from the repository and build it myself.

   Thanks very much, David.

   That module is required for postgrey. But, I've found what appears to be a
better approach: a selective grey listing by Christian Mock in Austria. See
<http://www.tahina.priv.at/~cm/spam/>.

   Unfortunately, installation of that was high-centered when I tried using
CPAN to install Mail::SPF::Querry. That's the one on which I'll focus
efforts to get installed.

Actually, John should probably run the restart command on his computer.

Bwahahaa.

:) :) :)

Actually, it wasn't necessary because I had to shut down to go to the
Clinic yesterday anyway. But I have saved the restart command as I will
no doubt be using it again.

When I shut down the computer I also discovered something else about
this problem. I was printing 100 copies of a fairly large book from
Adobe Reader. There are two ways to do this. If you use the GUI, Reader
will concatenate individual print jobs into one massive spool file. And
then each job will be printed de novo, that is, I lose the speed
benefit of "RIP once, print many." Now, Adobe Reader does print pretty
quickly, but I prefer to get as much speed as possible out of the
printer. So instead of that option I used the command line "lp -P
<printername> -# 100." This was working fine and I thought that it was
doing it by "RIP once, print many" because when I executed the command
it spooled just one copy and was done. Well, when I shut down the
computer to go to the Clinic, the printer suddenly stopped.

Yep, the lp command was sending the job over and over quietly in the
background. I suppose that's better than making a massive spool file,
but it doesn't give me the speed increase benefit from "RIP once, print
many," plus I have to leave the computer connected.

Because I was in a hurry to get to the Clinic I didn't have time to
futz with it further and I needed the printer running while I was off
playing Linux geek. I had to go to the Windows computer and resend the
print job from Adobe Reader there. 

So now I have no solution for printing these jobs properly from Linux.
Kpdf works great, just like Adobe Reader from Windows, except its first
copy out is glacially slow. I mean sometimes two or three minutes per
page. Canon WX engine printers like mine tend to spill toner when the
printer doesn't run at a reasonable clip, so the first copy out is
messed up, plus this tends to cause jams. But at least it does "RIP
once, print many," uses job offset, shows in the printer control panel
which copy is being printed and which tray it is being printed from.
Adobe Reader can't do any of those things, but prints extremely fast.
There is a button on the print dialog box that says "Optimize for
speed." It is checked by default. I don't know how Adobe does this or
why Kpdf apparently does not.

Evince and all the other PDF viewers have lame print dialog boxes that
don't offer the options that I need.

My next attack on this issue will be to wander over to the KDE forums
and wikis and stuff and see if I can find out why Kpdf is so slow.

I should also mention that the printer has genuine imitation Adobe
PostScript level 2. I know little of the relationship between PDF and
PostScript, except that PDF is somehow a streamlined and viewable
version of PostScript. So maybe there is a way to bypass the viewers
and just send the file to the printer. I know I can create a PostScript
print file and then send that to the printer. But the PostScript print
file would need the features set properly to give me "RIP once, print
many," job offset, and all the other goodies this printer is capable of
doing.

Meantime, any further suggestions are welcome.

Don't expect them to last as long as Xerox copies.

I have found that laser printer printouts tend to stick together after a few
years.  (I have a bunch of stuff from the 80s that I just found, as well as
more recient printouts.  Interesting what you find after unpacking from a
move.)

I downloaded a PDF to read and mostly it's fine. But it is missing some
characters, replacing them with blanks. These characters are probably
special characters (Greek symbols in equations).

My question is, Is this my problem or the PDF's. Do I not have some fonts
installed or configured on my system? Or is it a problem with the way the
PDF was made? Thanks.

Sounds like the fonts were not embedded in the pdf.

Many fonts have the "no embed" flag set to prevent them from being included
in documents.  (It is an "anti-copying scheme" by the font manufacturers.
It is pretty easy to bypass if you know which bits to twiddle.)

If the pdf does not have the font available, it will try and guess.  Not all
fonts have all of the proper characters.  (The usual example of this is the
weird upper ascii character that MS-Word uses for an apostrophe.)

If you can find the original font name, you can try to get a copy of it.
Linux will handle TrueType fonts just fine.

What's the difference between current Laser printer and copier pigment?

I thought they used the same technology of fusing particles.

Different formulations, from what I can tell.  (For one thing, you get less
dpi from a xerox machine.  About 72dpi, in my experience.)

Old xeroxes seem to hold up better (and not stick together) than the old
laser prints.

It may just depend on who made the machine and the type of toner used.

Last I checked, BerkleyDB (as in DB_File) was part of the core perl
distribution.  It Just Works(tm).  You may be missing the actualy
libraries that handle the db interactions (as in, not perl stuff), so
the API fails...

Mail::SPF::Query I've no real experience with, but a good starting point
is what particular error message you're getting.  CPAN sometimes doesn't
handle dependencies well.  If you're getting an error message like
"Can't Locate Foo/Bar.pm in @INC (@INC contains.....)" message, you need
to install the Foo::Bar module.

Dave,

   Perhaps. Nothing else complains. :-)

   With a couple of modules, CPAN found missing dependencies, asked about
installing them, then did so when I pressed [Enter]. The problem was a
failed test.

   I grabbed the tarball for Mail::SPF::Query and built/installed it
manually. Now that I have Christian Monk's 'selective-greylist' correctly
installed (the web page is a bit ambiguous, but I'll provide him with
suggested changes to make it more clear), it should be working properly.

   I suppose the next step is to install gocr and the SA addon that looks at
attached images for the same spam signatures it looks for in the textual
part of the message.

   The folks who are so very clever to create these tools have my greatest
respect and thanks. My expertise and abilites are in completely different
subject areas so I appreciate what they provide to keep us free from the
*(&@#$ spammers.

Subject: [PLUG] Problems vmware player...
Message-ID: <1166434690.4120.15.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Vmware Workstation 5.5, when I ran Warcraft in an XP Home virtual
machine, would stretch Warcraft to fit the screen.  In player same
virtual image when I expand to full screen, no stretching at all.  
Is there any way to achieve the same behavior in player that I saw 
in workstation?  I don't know if Workstation actually stretched
Warcraft to fit the screen or if it dropped the screen to 640x480
resolution in full screen mode.

I can change the resolution of X via "ctrl alt -," but this isn't 
the greatest work around.  It lowers the resolution, but shoves part 
of the current desktop off screen.  Nothing like having to scroll your
virtual machine back on screen and refocus on it.  I wish with vmware
player I could lock to the virtual machine window so that hitting the
edge causes the virtual machine to scroll instead of kicking me out onto
the host system.

Has anyone else had problems getting the same result with player that
they experienced with workstation?

Player ideally is workstation without the option to create new
virtual machines.  Sadly, it appears to be a lot less than that.

Do you have the vmware tools installed on the guest OS?

The BerkleyDB module is different than DB_File; the latter only
implements the BDBv1 interface.

Even if you do have the tools already installed, it may be worth
re-installing them.  I've always had the suspicion that they interact
with the VMWare instance somehow.  It would be interesting to know if
that does have an effect, in any case.

It depends on the OS.  With Windows as a guest OS, you should just be able
to install the toolkit and resolve the issue.  (I believe it also installs a
video driver for the guest.)  For a Linux guest OS, you need to recompile it
for each time you upgrade the kernel.  (It does not replace the video driver
since that part is included with X. It does effect the clock, however.)

You can create VMWare images with the free VMWare server version.

BTW, I am typing this using VMWare player running an image of Fedora Core 5
under Windows.

Ed,

   I've not had the need to interact with the UPS. However, since one
unfortunate experience with a TrippLite (sp?) unit, I've used only APC
models. The apcupsd works well with these. Perhaps it will allow you the
two-way communication you desire.

Ed,

I've had good luck with APC.  I'd suggest looking at Network UPS Tools
(NUT) and finding out which modules it supports and, if you're so
inclined, give preference to companies supporting the project.

http://www.networkupstools.org/

In addition to manager and agents for shutting systems down, it provides
a web interface and a command-line interface.  At one job, I had an
add-in card from APC that monitored temperature and humidity and it
provided that data also.

At one time, I had Net-SNMP configured to use the CLI to make the data
available through SNMP and graphed it with Cricket.  I still have the
top-level Cricket config file and a sample host file.

Is there an equivalent tool I could run from a Knoppix CD that will work

Not sure if it is included on Knoppix but all my Redhatian based systems 
have shred.

The man page mentions issue with several file systems but I don't think 
it would be a problem for you.  That is if you're planning on a complete 
wipe of the partition(s)?

DBAN ( http://dban.sourceforge.net/ ) is my favourite, but his task 
sounds like keeping theWinXP partition intact is a high priority.

   And there's Darik's Boot and Nuke <http://dban.sourceforge.net/>. I've
used it to scrub data from hard drives before they're donated or tossed in
the recycling system. It takes a long while to run, but someone would have
to want those data fragments very badly to spend the money to try to recover
them.

No. They still want XP running when I'm done. They just want to erase a
lot of data.

As Jason mentioned, that will go way beyond what these clients need.
Reloading XP and all their software is not part of the plan. Just wiping
out old data.

Five things:
1. That's a strange thing to ask for on a Linux/Unix Group list.
2. That said, you should be able to use a Linux bootcd and shred.
3. If you want a 'Doze-ish solution, google for secure delete windows.
4. That said, there'll be enough of the data lying around from older,
   deleted versions of the files that you'd best just wipe with dd or
   badblocks and reinstall.  Winders needs regular reinstalls anyway.
5. If you can't reinstall Winders because of license issues, might I

Rod,

Go to www.Sysinternals.com and download "sdelete".  That will do the job for
you.
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/fileanddiskutilities.mspx
You can use it to zap all the unallocated blocks on the disk too.

Note that XP uses NTFS. Linux has been weak in NTFS read/write
support until recently (ntfs-3g). The last thing I read about ntfs-3g
was that is was still in beta. Norton Wipe Info seems to be able
to handle directories (recursive, depth-first wipe?). I don't see the same
facility in 'shred' (single files only?) just looking at the command line
options, but I guess you could use 'find' to duplicate that.

You can also look at Eraser <http://www.tolvanen.com/eraser/>. AFAIK, 
both sdelete and eraser are
windows utilities w/o Linux versions/equivalents. (meaning not
useful in Knoppix).

Same here on a few systems.  One curiosity, is there an easy way with
CPAN to figure out what to upgrade under Slackware?  I've been using
EasyTCP, although I may switch to php as it appears to be more
straightforward.

At this point, I want to pipe in my concerns about greylisting and
SPF.  

SPF doesn't appear to be as widely adopted as it needs to
be to meet it's full potential.  I've run into advice googling 
that NAT makes helo/ehlo filtering inappropriate. I wonder how 
NAT affects SPF?  

If you have four NAT routers and your mail server is behind them, you
could end up trying to connect to a greylisting smtp server from
potentially four different ip addresses.  By then, your email has
probably bounced back to you.

Multiple domains on a single subnet I understand is not uncommon.  In
this kind of an environment, does the provider have to control the SPF
records for every single hosted domain?

Why are reverse dns PTR zones only 1:1, yet forward dns zones are at
least many:1?  Mapping 1:many seems to be logically needed if mapping
many:1 is allowed.

I don't know if common SPF implementations use: reverse DNS, whois,
and/or forward dns.  I'm assuming forward DNS on the sender from
address looking for an SPF record to try and verify that an 
SMTP server authorized for the domain of that address is the 
current client.  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
I'm assuming an IP address is gained from the SPF record which is
compared to the client SMTP server's IP address.



...A WHOIS EXAMPLE...
BTW, how does whois on something like foo at 1.2.3.4
actually work?  Let's say 1.2.3.4 is mapped to the bad.example.org
domain so that doing whois foo at bad.example.org and whois foo at 1.2.3.4
return the same name servers and contact information.  Does this work
right if multiple domains:1 subnet is considered?  Say gimmeabreak.org
is also hosted on the same subnet that bad.example.org is on.  Let's
say you have the ip address from gimmeabreak.org, but not the domain
name.  Let's say there's an email from an address of
fred at nat2.gimmeabreak.lan coming from an ip address of 1.2.3.4. 
Authenticating the latter is not an uncommon issue in my experience.
Because of NAT, unlisted addresses can't just be discarded.  The
remote smtp server should have masqueraded fred at nat2.gimmeabreak.lan
to fred at gimmeabreak.org, right?  



...CAN POSTFIX BE MADE NAT AWARE?...
Can Postfix masquerade from and to addresses based on which network
it is trying to reach?  For example, fred at nat2.gimmeabreak.lan is
a valid source on private network A, but the from needs to change 
to fred at gimmeabreak.org for going to an Internet destination or
fread at nat2.outofhismind.wan for going to a private destination on 
say network B.

Postfix often has to be set up in a special way on hosting sites that
use it.  Virtual machine hosting, like one sees at godaddy.com, is
becoming more popular though.

This may be the most important point for me to make to them: that there
are likely to be bits and pieces floating around. They are not very
sophisticated folks, but I think they'll understand that it would take
someone with sophistication to be able to find anything useful after the
files and folders have been wiped.

I'd love to convert them, but I suspect they won't even know the name
Linux. They are reasonably sophisticated with the tools they use,
though, at least one of which is not available on Linux (Word Perfect).

I downloaded this on my XP laptop and tried it. Seems to work just fine,
and, based on the iffy-ness of Linux NTFS support, is what I will
probably use.

Thanks. I didn't really want to buy a tool for just this one job.

Thanks for the pointer about NTFS, and the lack of recursion in shred.

Subject: [PLUG] Version Control and Open Office Documents
Message-ID: <20061220180659.GA7562@gate.kl-ic.com>


How about a mashup of Open Office with a version control system, like
GIT or Subversion?

Open Office Writer has a function "Edit - Compare Document", which
does a function similar to the merge operations of GIT or SVN.  Open
Office can be controlled from the command line, using the API, so it
should be possible to do differencing and merging from a hook script
in the version control system.  This would make Open Office documents
as compatable with version control as plain text files, and provide a
powerful incentive for organizations to move from Word to Open Office.

I imagine consultants could make big bucks teaching organizations how
to do this.  Anyone interested in helping me figure this out?

Hi Jim.

We use Iron Mountain here at Laika.  They are worldwide,  but have a local facility here in Portland.

Not sure on pricing, but I heard it is about $100 if you need to retrieve a tape outside of your normal schedule.

Check out:  ironmountain.com

Hope this helps!

I don't know the sophistication of OS/Software config of these machines, 
but you could have had this done in 2 or 3 hours if you had just wiped 
them, started over, reinstalled and restored personal files.  Sometimes 
the time to ask all these questions and research the issues takes many 
times longer than starting over.  If it's an issue that comes up often, 
or you really do want to learn about this specific thing than it's 
different I suppose.

I can attest to the fact that I would not want a XP machine that
someone else has used for several years as my new machine without
re-installing the OS.  The registery get so large with un-needed items
that it really cannot be fixed without a re-install.  It slows the
machine down terribly.

Not to mention all the spyware and other gotchas hiding in the system.

One place I worked had a server that had been on loan to the sales manager 
for a while.  I had to reformat and reinstall.  It was easier than digging 
out the couple dozen spyware and malware bots she had downloaded by using 
Kazaa.

Subject: [PLUG] gah, novice performs vigorous foot-perforation with git!
Message-ID: <868xh2s0yd.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


So, fresh of the inspiring presentation of git, I am busy trying it
out to help organize a bunch of data we collected along with some
analytic infrastructure.  I put the main infrastructure into the
master branch, in a ${ROOT}/dev directory, and a bunch of
lab/calibration type data into a branch called test-data, in a
${ROOT}/data directory.  I am going to put some field data into
another branch.  Okay, so I want the infrastructure scripts available
to the various branches, so I try to remember what git command I am
supposed to use, and get-rebase sounds right.  I checkout the
test-data branch with:

  git-checkout test-data

Then apply:

  git-rebase master test-data

I resolve a few merge conflicts (or I think I do, remember I am a
novice).  I type:

  $ git-rebase -v --continue
  You must edit all merge conflicts and then
  mark them as resolved using git update-index  

Okay, so I do what the man says, and I:

  $ git update-index .gitignore dev/scripts/generate-report.sh

and then for kicks:

  $ git-rebase -v --continue

  Applying 'added some more local processing tweaks'

  No changes - did you forget update-index?

  When you have resolved this problem run "git rebase --continue".
  If you would prefer to skip this patch, instead run "git rebase --skip".
  To restore the original branch and stop rebasing run "git rebase --abort".

Hmm, update-index?  Didn't I just do that?  Okay, now we are coming to
the stupid part.  I type:

  $ git-status     
  # On branch refs/heads/test-data
  # Untracked files:
  #   (use "git add" to add to commit)
  #
  #       .dotest/
  nothing to commit

I think to myself: "hmm, i'm done with that, aren't I?" and poof:

  $ rm -rf .dotest

then for good measure:

  $ git-rebase -v master test-data

which is what I started out with.  

Oops.  Where is ${ROOT}/data???

Heh.  I assume it is in .git/objects somewhere, but I'm thinking now
that "rm -rf .dotest" wasn't on the Official Souvenir Program.
git-log pretends not to know anything about my data directory.

No real worries, as this was experimental and I have all the original
copies, but is there a way I can turn back the time machine to before
I machine-gunned my foot?

TIA for any helpful clues.

Yesterday I went away for a few hours, but I left my Dapper laptop
running. I usually do leave it running, and I have no automatic
shutdown settings that I know of. For example, I leave it running when
I go to bed, and in the morning it is still running. The only thing
that kicks in is the screensaver.

When I came home it was completely turned off. I immediately assumed
something had gone flakey with the power brick and the battery had run
down as a result. But when I restarted it the battery was fully charged.

I would never leave it without being sure all open files had been
saved, so I didn't lose anything. Nevertheless, it is disconcerting.
This has never happened before. I'd like to know what made it suddenly
decide to shut itself down. Does anyone have any ideas?

Do you have a cat? They do like to make mischief.

Maybe you had a power outage long enough to drain the battery? Then it charged 
back up when the power came back on.

It wasn't in hibernation. It was completely off. I pressed the power
button and it went through the entire normal boot process. I did wander
through Ubuntu's GUI trying to figure out if there was a setting
somewhere that could cause this, but I didn't see anything obvious.
However, I never paid any attention to what the settings were before,
so if something is changed I wouldn't probably be aware of it.

Carla Schroder dijo:
> Do you have a cat? They do like to make mischief.

Yeah, I do. But the power button is very small on this computer. He'd
have to have pressed it with a claw, because his furry foot is too big.
And he would have had to hold the claw down on it for ten seconds
before it would have powered off. As cats go, he is pretty bright. But
not that bright. :)

I did already think of the cat, but I think the possibility is too
remote to take it seriously. I'd rather think I have a hardware
failure. Maybe there is a flaky connection in the power wiring. That's
my current fave theory. But if that's what happened, it sounds
expensive to fix. I was hoping there is some simple Linux setting that
could shut the computer down if unattended for x period of time, and
somehow it got triggered.

All the clocks are still correct, and the stereo was still going when I
got home. 

Those were good suggestions, but I'm still wondering.

You may find something if you poke around /var/log. 
The messages file is a good place to start.

Subject: [PLUG] Here is a simple MySQL question
Message-ID: <586285960.1166659792792.JavaMail.root@fepweb11>

Here's a simple MySQL question. I've been working through an example and discovered that the downloaded sql scripts do not work. Should they work as given?

I can modify them to work. I must give the default value for a column as the same type as the column. The book I'm reading is "Multi-Tier Application Programming with PHP" by David Wall. It's fairly new although as you can see below it does use Type instead of Engine (which works OK).

This is what I must do, however...

Here is what is in the download ....
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ACCT_account;

CREATE TABLE `ACCT_account`
(`id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT ,
`name` varchar(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT '' ,
`parent` int DEFAULT '' ,
PRIMARY KEY (`id`))
TYPE=InnoDB;

Here is how I must modify it to work ...
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ACCT_account;

CREATE TABLE `ACCT_account`
(`id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT ,
`name` varchar(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT '' ,
`parent` int DEFAULT 0 ,
PRIMARY KEY (`id`))
TYPE=InnoDB;

I was just fighting something very similar on a Windows based install of
MySQL (shudder). I'm going to make as assumption and say you're using MySQL
5.x correct? If so it has to do with Strict Checking. I haven't installed
5.x on any of my linux boxen yet so I can't tell you how to disable it but
that should be the trick.

This used to work on mysql 5.0.2 without throwing an error - but has 
been 'corrected' by mysql 5.0.24 most likely to be more ANSI compliant.  
It doesn't make sense to assign a '' to an integer value (the only other 
possibility would be for it to be default NULL).  The change you've made 
will not negatively affect any higher level development.

Now that's a good idea I hadn't thought of!

Unfortunately, the messages file didn't show anything untoward.
However, I did find something else that I have been wondering about for
some time. Right after the Grub menu I get a couple messages that flash
so fast I can't read more than the first word or two. But there they
were in the messages file! Finally I may be able to figure out what
they mean:

Dec 18 14:17:29 localhost kernel: [75351.528067] opera[21469]: segfault
at 0000000000000010 rip 0000000008527af2 rsp 00000000ffffc650 error 4
Dec 18 14:28:02 localhost kernel: [76016.600447] opera[23861]: segfault
at 0000000000000000 rip 00000000081b83da rsp 00000000ffffb200 error 4

I wonder if this is related to my continuing problems with hard disk
corruption. The messages file also had more segfault messages in other
places. And in spite of my having "fixed" the hard drive connector
problem, I'm still getting corruption  now and then. (Maybe it's not
really fixed.)

Also, how does one run fsck? You can't run it on a mounted partition,
right? But I have to be booted into Linux to use it. Is the normal
procedure to use a live CD?

   I know nothing about MySqueal, but in PostgreSQL and SQLite3 there is no
quoting around the names of variables. So the above would be written:

   create table ACCT_account (id interger not null auto_increment,
                              name varchar(100) not null default ' ',
 			     parent integer default NULL,
 			     primary key (id));

   Notice that your parent field is an integer but you're assigning an empty
string as the default. You should assign a number or NULL if the poor field
doesn't know who its parent is.

HTH,

Rich

   Or, as root, switch to run level 1 (single user mode) by typing 'telinit
1' (without the quotes). After the system shuts down multiuser mode (run
levels 3 and 5, usually), you'll get a root login prompt. Login and see
what's mounted. You can then unmount a partition and run the appropriate
fsck on it.

   When you're all finished, you can 'telinit 3' (or 'telinit 5') and return
to what you were doing.

You can boot from a Knoppix CD or Gentoo Universal Installer CD or the
like.  Rich's way sounds cool - much quicker.

There are two standard ways.  They involve a text window, as root.

1)  Bring up a text window.  change user to root:
  [john]$  su - root
  Password:  YourRootPasswordHere
  [root]#  touch /forcefsck
  [root]#  reboot            (or just do it with the GUI)

2)  Bring up a text window.  change user to root:
  [john]$  su - root
  Password:  YourRootPasswordHere
  [root]#  /sbin/shutdown -F -r

Either of these will cause the system to fsck ALL the partitions
when it restarts (otherwise, the root partition can't be fixed).
Note that this can take a LONG time, proportional to the ratio of
disk size over the machine speed, about 15 minutes on my 80GByte,
1.6GHz laptop.

If you have the time to spare, and nothing critical coming up for
the next day or two, it is a good idea to do this every two or
three months.  While we like to brag about how long Linux can go
without rebooting, most file systems are set up to force an fsck
after 180 days without a reboot, or after 30 reboots.  The times
when you really need to reboot to fix something, you will probably
be in a hurry, and waiting an extra 15 minutes for an fsck at those
times is NOT a happy experience.

However, if you have not fsck'ed for a while, and really need to
reboot quickly, you can do a:
  [root]#  /sbin/shutdown -f -r    (lower case "f")
and it will prevent an fsck for the next reboot.  Don't do that
too often, or inevitable bit rot will give your hard drive gangrene.

Oh, and do backups.  See "www.dirvish.org" for my favorite method ...

Subject: [PLUG] Kubuntu Time Problem
Message-ID: <200612202350.15839.aaron@madebyai.com>

Hello all,

My mother's computer is exhibiting a strange problem, and I'm not familiar 
enough with Kubuntu/Debian to figure it out. Whenever the PC is powered down, 
it comes back up with the system clock being hours off. I'm guessing what's 
happening is the RTC is being written UTC at shutdown and being read as local 
at startup. I installed OpenNTPd (what I run on all my gentoo boxes and have 
great success with) and it keeps the time perfectly synced while the system 
is on, but as soon as it reboots the clock is off so far the adjtime syscall 
fails. (Seems like 8 hours or so, which makes sense for the timezone 
difference)

The box only runs this distro (i.e. no windows messing with the clock) and 
everything is all up to date.

When I was at PSU, I had a lot of experience with APC battery failures
that took out the entire unit causing a power outage.  We did a large
c3750 upgrade that we deployed with TrippLite's in 2004-05.

I'm sure there are horror stories for both camps.  You've now heard mine. :)

Yep. In Kubuntu:
K Menu -> 
System Settings -> 
System Administration section Date & Time ->
Enter administrator mode with the button on the lower right ->
Select timezone ->
Close

Pretty easy

Well, my brother bought Wordperfect 8 for Linux.  Corel ran into trouble
shortly after that though. 

Why did your client upgrade from Windows 98 anyways?  The problem
with XP is that WPA is a royal pain in the butt.  Hardware
fingerprinting is just plain wrong, Microsoft is trying to restrict
legit use more than piracy.  This will be especially true if Vista
refuses to boot after say it's main partition has been accessed by
an NT 4.0 system.  For Microsoft to say, "we'll give people a way
around WPA on XP if we feel like it," that is not very encouraging.
Microsoft obviously concerned that people won't migrate to Vista is
not going to relax the XP licensing scheme.  All I can say if you 
have an activated copy of XP and you forsee needing to use it in 
the future is, learn about MondoBackup and qtparted.  Install Linux 
to the second half of the drive and be aware that you won't be able 
to do any major hardware changes on this system anymore.

XP fingerprints the burned in MAC address on the network card and
probably about four other hardware characteristics as well.  I
don't know if XP Pro fingerprints, but why spend $400 for a legit
copy of it?

When they clean up the language on their site and get going again,
you might want to refer these clients to http://www.reactos.org/.
The project at the moment appears to be failing.  If a grass
roots funding campaign gets started, maybe it will breathe new 
life into it.  I don't see ReactOS as a system anyone should 
standardize on, but if the project can get stable sooner it 
might provide a nice temporary drop in replacement for people 
needing an alternate migration path who don't want to go from 
XP to Vista.  Eventually, everyone in XP now will lose it.

The best way to for sure erase delted files is to mirror your hard drive
shortly after you install XP to another one and destroy the one you
copied when it's time to ensure that the files are gone.  This technique
requires that hard drives be bought in pairs.  Destruction via
sledgehammer works quite well.

Seriously though, Microsoft, if the rumors on 
http://www.linux-ntfs.org/ are true, is moving to give fair use the
biggest black eye in the history of software licensing.  There are a
number of shops with custom NT4.0 software that will probably try to
access a Vista partition from NT4.  Microsoft is apparently trying to
halt the use of NT with Vista.

I've heard credible rumors that Microsoft redid the network stack in
Vista because the Windows 2000 stack was directly lifted from BSD.  
I wonder if Microsoft violated any BSD licensing terms and is trying
to cover that up?

Why did the world get into the whole NTFS mess in the first place?
Why did companies pay for Microsoft to shove the whole world into 
a proprietary file system?  Sure, fat filesystems are terrible.
You'd think anyone with a large budget in need of reliable systems
is smart enough to avoid vendor lock in.  Microsoft is attempting 
to achieve vendor lock in on an enormous scale now.  Where is the
resistance to this?  Is MacOS-X cursed with a WPA scheme now or do
you only have to provide a code?

Message-ID: <1166672577.11149.3.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I've noticed my archives for Redhat 9 are missing the source code.
I also want to make sure I have all the updates for Redhat 6.2,
Redhat 7.3, and Redhat 9.  The latter are the older releases
that I'm maintaining.  I have all the updates for Redhat 7.3 and
I appear to have them for Redhat 6.2, but not Redhat 9.

Has Redhat dumped all pre Fedora releases from their ftp servers?

With Fedora releasing at such a rapid rate, how can one keep their
own ftp or NFS Fedora archive up to date?  How do you create your own
yum mirror?  So far, I'm only putting the odd numbered Fedora releases
on my ftp site.  It would help as far as updates if Fedora legacy
would periodically rerelease older Fedora releases with the updates
worked into them.  Instead of maintaining updates with releases, one
could host the most recent rerelease.  This would save space.  A patch
against the last iso could used to update to a rerelease reducing the
amount one has to download.  At the pace that Fedora replaces itself,
rerelease patches could save a lot of bandwidth.

Message-ID: <200612211038.07509.carla@bratgrrl.com>

Gather ye round, antique Unix geeks, for I have a question of irresistible 
attraction.

I'm running a test Asterisk server on CentOS 4.4. Mostly I administer it 
remotely over SSH. A funny thing happens when I open the Asterisk console:

[root at asterisk1 ~]# asterisk -r
<snip>
Connected to Asterisk 1.4.0-beta3 currently running on asterisk1 (pid = 3121)
Verbosity is at least 3
asterisk1*CLI>

I'm using Konsole on the remote PC. The colors are black fonts, white 
background. As soon as I run a command on the Asterisk CLI, the colors change 
to black background, colored fonts. It doesn't happen with every Asterisk 
command, just most of them. It doesn't change with opening the Asterisk CLI, 
I have to run a command.

Where is this configured? It's driving me nuts. I've looked at /etc/profle, 
bashrc, bash_profile, and /etc/profile.d on both machines. I can't figure out 
where this behavior is controlled. I must know, I must I tell you!  Any 
pointers on where to look or how to figure it out are much appreciated.

They moved them.  If you look at
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/README, you see:

Older versions of Red Hat Linux have been moved to the following location:

It sounds like there are some ANSI escape sequences embedded in 
Asterick. The TERM environment variable is key here. See, e.g.,

Pretty much all APC battery backup units (I assume that's what you meant,
since uninterruptable power supplies are usually diesel powered and take up
a crapload of space) are Linux-friendly with a variety of OSS software
available to read status and log power information with.  I don't know why
other manufacturers even bother at this point... APC's are generally
reasonably priced, reliable and they're drop in, plug-n-play, the batteries
are of a standard type and readily replaced, and they just work.  I really
can't think of anything anybody could possibly want out of a power supply
that most APC units don't offer by default.

Good luck, Microsoft:  IIRC, winver on Vista reports it as being NT 6.0 in
so many words.

PHBs making the decisions love to spend more money on a crappier solution if

Probably won't be much resistance to this, the world's still trying to wrap
it's head around the idea that Vista is the last operating system from
Microsoft.

What a weird thing to do. Thanks, adding 'asterisk TERM=linux asterisk' to the

I have a hard time reading on a black background, and it doesn't return to the 
Konsole colors after exiting the Asterisk CLI.

/dev/random runs out of entropy quickly.  Best use /dev/urandom instead.

I remember hearing an ex-Sequent dev griping about how slow the Linux
random-number device was.  "How hard can it be to generate random
numbers?  I can write a program to generate them faster myself!"

When I tried to explain the difference between real and pseudo-random
numbers, his eyes glazed over.  I don't think he even heard the
important bit, "/dev/urandom is faster" before he wandered off to find
someone more gripe-friendly.

Just out of curiosity, what makes urandom so much better, and why don't
we just link /dev/random to /dev/urandom?

The computer is about 4 months old, no other signs of failing battery.

I'm 99% sure this is a problem with however it's setting the system clock from 
the hardware clock. On other distros you can configure someplace on the 
system whether the RTC stores UTC or local time, and the hwclock call at 
shutdown will take that into account. I'll check the BIOS later to see if 
it's being written incorrectly or read incorrectly.

I read the debian README about the hwclock init script and it doesn't say 
anything about these settings.

Thanks for the ideas so far.

JFWPI:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random

In short, /dev/urandom contains less entropy (it's "less random")
than /dev/random, but /dev/urandom will produce w/o blocking,
whereas /dev/random will block (will seem to stall/take much longer to
generate a given given number of random bytes).

/dev/random is a source of honest-to-goodness truly random numbers,
carefully collected from the wild.  It is impossible to guess what the
next number will be based on the previous ones.

/dev/urandom is a source of pseudo-random numbers, which are generated
by an algorithm.  Algorithms always do the same thing, so it's possible
to guess what the next number will be based on the previous ones.

Problem with /dev/random is, there's only so much entropy (randomness) 
available at a time*.  So it can't generate numbers very fast.

So you use /dev/urandom if you need a whole lot of somewhat-random
numbers real fast, and you use /dev/random if you want a handful of
truly-random numbers.  Quantity vs. quality, y'see.

This is the "standard" way, it will work on most flavors of Unix (haven't
seen one where it doesn't work, but just in case there was someone insane
out there). The advanced method is to remount the filesystem read-only
(mount <mount point|device> [-n] -o ro,remount), and then run fsck. This
is what creating /forcefsck or shutdown -F cause to happen behind the
scenes. The real trick is to make / and /usr read-only, and which point
the only concern is /var (but which the system can get most of the way up
without). Having the filesystems read-only also tends to avoid damage
being done in the first place.

> Oh, and do backups.  See "www.dirvish.org" for my favorite method ...

Indeed, backups, backups, and just in case you didn't hear it the first
time, backups. I prefer `dump` (SysV-style!) once you figure out the
syntax, it is a very effective backup tool.

Here's a possibility.  Look at man hwclock.  You can set the hardware
clock to whatever you want, and then set local time accordingly. 
You may have to do some fiddling to get the right relationship.

Ok, I don't like all the things MS does either, but I've yet to have WPA 
be a pain.  I won't bore with details, but outside of a primary hard 
drive or motherboard swap, it accepts almost 6 other hardware changes 
with in a given time period before triggering a re-activate.  As a 
hardware enthusiast who changes hardware often this hasn't happened to 
me yet.  It's a phone call to make, but it only takes a few minutes. 
Who will have to do this?  A very small percentage of overall Windows 
users.  So they're not targeting the legit users that I can see.  It's 
the method they chosen to prevent piracy.  I'm not fond of it either, 
but it's not as bad as a lot of people make it out to be.

This is speculation.  Windows Update still works for Windows 95 even 
though there are no /new/ patches released.  While they could certainly 
stop providing reactivation codes for XP users, it doesn't seem likely.

Actually it (both Pro and HE) looks at 10 categories of the machine for 
hardware finger printing.  The corp addition has no WPA components. 
This is why the Corp version is the one pirated in almost all cases. 
It's only $90 $ $140 online though depending on the version you're after.

Mirroring doesn't /require/ paired drives.  I have an 80 and a 120 
mirrored now in my web server.  The volume of course is only 80GB, and I 
didn't set out to do it this way, but circumstances forced it at the time.

At this point there are far more reasons to stop using NT4 than Vista. 
Lack of new driver support is a big one as well as it's end-of-life 
status.  Most Linux shops have moved to a model that says support for a 
given version only lasts so long.  I see this is the almost the same thing.

You're right on this.  No one knows if it's true, but wouldn't that be a 
nice courtroom discussion to sit in on! ;)

NTFS is a good system.  But it's long in the tooth and wil most likely 
be replaced by WinFS when it's done.  Fat and Fat32 are no more open 
though are they?  A few years ago there was much chatter on slashdot 
about MS thinking on forcing licensing for all forms of flash media to 
license the FAT file system they were preformatted with.  This obviously 
didn't go through.

Nah, no more than normal.  But what do I know.  I'm a BSD guy. ;)

IIRC: (not tested for syntax)
$foo[-200]= 'bar'; //array value of a string, with a key value of  
*negative* 200 numeric integer
$foo["$i--"]= 'bar'; //array value of a string, with a key value of

string is 0/false, foo123/123, or $i=$foo-$baz, do fun and exciting  
different things.

In programmer-space:
Keys are usually user-made, and can be user controlled. Indicies are  
auto-generated, but can be user-manipulated. How the auto-generated  
keys were *created* has changed to alter negative values.

>   Aren't you supposed

Nope. (shouldn't computers do that work? :P)

$foo[]= "baz"; // next index number (aka key) for this array element  
is being generated by php

This comes in quite handy, actually, when dealing with http forms and  
an unknown number of array values. You can submit a whole group of  
values, and let PHP auto-build the array, or alternately, build  
arrays of unknown sizes without caring to specify keys for 10, or  
10000000, key=>value pairs.

It can get real fun when you see a line like:
$$foo["$$key--"]= $$value; //decrement a variable variable key, and  
assign a value to that variable variable array element with the  
variable variable key value, and then assign it to an variable  
variable array

>   Why this behavior change?

/me cringes at the thought of explaining PHP politics in changes like  
this

I'll guess at it, but only because I've been in PHP-land a long time.

The really short answer would be that negative values for things are  
often seen as, well, "bad".

The slightly longer answer is the PHP team spends a massive amount of  
time trying to cut down on the WTF factor, so adding an element to an  
array should add to something. Since many PHP users (such as you) are  
not in the habit of thinking that, oh, an array can have negative  
keys, might as well move stuff to zero-based arrays, so adding an  
element puts something into *positive* integer space, to avoid false  
<0 (false, heh) errors.

(Something I tell perl hackers moving into PHP: forget everything you  
know about groups of variables, PHP is totally different. I have to  
repeat this often, FWIW.)

The much longer answer likely involves at least a good 200-300 email  
messages on the PHP lists, where simple useOfCamelCase (in the *docs) 
* discussions took months to resolve, so +/- int wars in arrays might  
be, well..... ugly.

I am thinking about getting a wide-screen TFT monitor, probably with a resolution of 1680 x 1050 (WUXGA). I have heard
conflicting reports as to the adaptability of Linux to such a monitor.
Is it likely that it would work with native resolution of the monitor?
Are there any potential pitfalls?

Subject: [PLUG] Why Lost Mail From Root?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0612220626330.10204@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I need some help figuring out what's happening here.

   The script, /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm, is apparently run but the results
do not show up in my inbox.

   As root, I just ran it again manually, then checked mailq:

-Queue ID- --Size-- ----Arrival Time---- -Sender/Recipient-------
6ABE713493*   55991 Fri Dec 22 06:31:16  root at appl-ecosys.com
                                          rshepard at salmo.appl-ecosys.com

   This tells me that the script ran and the results sent by root to me. An
immediate re-invocation of mailq showed an empty queue.

   /var/log/maillog contains:

Dec 22 06:31:16 salmo postfix/pickup[19228]: 6ABE713493: uid=0 from=<root>
Dec 22 06:31:16 salmo postfix/cleanup[8154]: 6ABE713493: message-id=<20061222143

(delivered to command: /usr/bin/procmail)
Dec 22 06:31:37 salmo postfix/qmgr[5696]: 6ABE713493: removed

   But, it has not shown up in my inbox -- nor any other mail file if
mis-directed by procmail.

   How should I test to determine where and why it got lost? Other messages
-- including some spam that the greylisting should have blocked -- make
in through the process, so I'm totally puzzled why this one message has not
been properly delivered the past three days.

IIRC, this was discussed a few years back (although a quick Google
search for it in the archives didn't turn it up). Someone did a
character search on the Windows code and found the BSD text required by
the BSD license. So, I don't think there was a violation. Unless I'm
mistaken, the BSD license lets anyone do anything they want with the
code, as long as they acknowledge where they got it.

A Google search on Windows "BSD Network Stack" turns up a bunch of
entries, the first of which (for me) was about a Symantec report on
security problems with the new Vista network stack.

Check the archives; we had quite a discussion about this about a month
ago.  The quick answer is that while some distros combined with some
video boards might not automagically recognize an "odd" size like
1680x1050, you can easily talk to that or any other flat screen
resolution if you use the right video driver and fiddle with the X
configuration.  Chances are, though, it will "just work".

You will probably want to buy a DVI video card if you do not already
have one, and that might be slightly tricky - the addon video cards
are mostly for gamers, and burn a lot of power and cost a bunch.  To
get something lower power, I bought four used boards from the store
at Free Geek and tested them until I found the best one.

But again, check the archives, we discussed this.

All,
    I'm curious as to people's opinions about the following:  My company
just purchased two new servers to consolidate a bunch of services we
currently have running on miscellaneous boxes (bugzilla, wiki, request
tracker, xplanner, dev and qa versions of our app, etc.).  I am wondering if
you think it wiser to have one server act as the database server for all
these apps and the other server act as the webserver for them all, or to
break it out so that each server acts as a database and webserver and serves
up half the apps?

Tim,

   What situation are you trying to avoid?

   From your description, all applications are mission critical. If that's
correct, then the company cannot afford to lose any single piece for more
than a coffee break. In this situation it makes more sense to replicate
everything on a separate box so if one goes down the other remains up and
folks are still productive.

   If that's not the case, but you're trying to spread a heavy load for beter
rsponse times, then partitioning the tools between the two systems makes
more sense.

Are the servers similar or is one more powerful than the other?  If different
put the resource intensive apps on one.

If the servers are equivalent and can support the entire group of apps consider
putting everything on both boxes.  Use one for production, the other as a hot
spare or testing/dev box.

Rich,
    To answer your question, I was thinking more in terms of the load and
response time on each box, but you make a good point.

Michael,
    To answer your question, the servers are identical.

I will have to figure out if one server can support the entire group of
apps.  My guess is yes in which case I like the idea of replicating
everything on both and having one for production, one for testing/dev that
can provide failover if the other dies.  I'll have to look at the load on
the other miscellaneous boxes to see if one server can handle it all first
though.  Thanks for the advice.

You haven't given us enough information to be good back-seat drivers. 
:-)

* How resource-intensive are your Apache applications? Bugzilla, RT,
  and wiki software needn't be a huge burden if configured correctly
  -- but they can chew lots of CPU if they get busy.

* How big/busy are your databases?

* How robust and fast is the network connecting the boxes?

* How much downtime can you stand?

If a single box has the horsepower and I/O bandwidth to handle it all, 
and uptime is a Real Need, I'd consolidate onto one server, making the 
second a hot spare using database replication and, perhaps, heartbeat 
or something similar.

Is there an entry for root in your /etc/aliases file?

With pflogsumm I have found it easier to just mail the results from
the cron job. For example here is the line from one of my  mail
servers:

45 0 * * * /usr/sbin/pflogsumm -d yesterday -u 100 -h 100
/var/log/mail.log.0 |/usr/bin/mail -s "newberry - Postfix daily mail
summary" serveradmins at amerine.net

I rotate the log at 12:25 am and have pflogsumm work on teh previous
days log at 12:45am. I just pipe the results to "mail".

Apache applications aren't too resource intensive.  The two boxes that are
currently hosting most of these look like their load sits around .4 (P4 with
hyperthreading)

* How big/busy are your databases?


Databases aren't that large in size(< 2GB), but are pretty busy.  The box
hosting the dev db has a load > 9.  Granted, this is on a Celeron 2.5GHz box
with a gig of ram, hence the need to upgrade:)

* How robust and fast is the network connecting the boxes?


The network between the boxes is currently 100MB, but I think I can get the
company to spring for a Gig switch in the next couple of weeks.

* How much downtime can you stand?


I'd say 4 hours at the most

Yeah, after your comments and those of Rich and Michael, this is the way I'm
leaning.  Thanks.

Mark,

   Yes. And, this has worked for more than three years so it's something new
that just cropped up.

   Here, /etc/cron.daily runs at 04:40 each day. Pre-pending the '1' to the
pflogsumm script ensures it runs before the logrotate script.

Check the archives; we had quite a discussion about this about a month
ago.  The quick answer is that while some distros combined with some
video boards might not automagically recognize an "odd" size like
1680x1050, you can easily talk to that or any other flat screen
resolution if you use the right video driver and fiddle with the X
configuration.  Chances are, though, it will "just work".





I have an Nvidia card. They provide their own Linux drivers and instructions. If it Just Works, I'll be done; otherwise, including a ModeLine in xorg.conf often works. Let's first see if it Just Works...But

Modeline "1680x1050" 146.2 1680 1784 1960 2240 1050 1053 1059 1089

FYI - I am running Ubuntu Edgy on a Viewsonic VG2230wm 22" Widescreen. I highly recommend this monitor. As far as I have seen it is the best bang for the buck. We paid about $380.00 for it. Note I had to go into xorg to set the 1680x1050 but other than that all works well. Also I am using an Nvidia Gforce4 TI 4200 with it.
Hope this helps!

Closer but not quite. /dev/urandom will also give you random numbers, but
will always give data back. In order to fill in for true random numbers,
urandom will also use pseudo-random numbers, but if a sufficient amount
of randomness is available urandom will give true random numbers. urandom
isn't pure psuedo-random, just you might merely get pseudo-random numbers
instead of truely random ones.

Got it here. You use /dev/random for things like public/private key pair
generation, where quality is much more important. /dev/urandom is used
for session keys where randomness is important, but getting some
randomness is much more important.

Heh.  On another list, a sysadmin was just complaining that his company
bought new hardware because some dev's database queries are poorly written.

The sysadmin offered to fix the dev's queries, and was told not to.

It's amazing how few web-app programmers understand relational databases.

I'm sure relational databases would have a hard time understanding
web-app programmers.

OTOH, web-apps usually use RDBMSes for storage, and it'd be silly for
someone writing a web-app to not understand the basics.  Mind, they
won't learn it in university (too practical) and they won't learn it on
the job unless they're forced to.

What general errors was the dev exhibiting.

My all time favorite was a custom app that would open, read and close
a 200 byte .ini file across a network an average of 4.77 times a second.
The developers said the network performance was killing their application.
I suggested they cache the tiny ini file.  They said it wasn't possible.

I'm not a web-app developer nor a dba, but why should web-developers
need to be db experts?

For most of the web applications that are simple and useful, things such
as adodb (or other language specific db api's) and a wiki full of
examples should provide enough to keep a developer creating a useful app.

If the developer is code competent, I would like to see more time spent
on security, UI design, and unit testing.

Now, if you're running critical applications on allocated CPU time on
WOPR.. maybe you need to be competent in all aspects of your
application.  Does apache even run on WOPR?[1] ;)



[1] Probably.. but you will need NetBSD first.

Don't tell me, let me guess. You're a Rails developer, right?

I don't think the interface is relevant to Mr' Burt's comment. He's
suggesting that if you're writing code that cares about the database,
YOU should know something about what the database is doing with your
tables and queries.

For most web apps that are simple and useful, each developer is probably
creating their own tables and crafting their own queries, right? Don't
you think it's reasonable to expect them to have a clue how the database
works?

You might conside db design as part of the UI.  It has a HUGE effect on
response time in a busy system.

I guess competence is underrated. I would rather be competent in
everything for which I bill. Maybe that's just me.

Nope.  "I'm not a web-app developer nor a dba".  Rails is a ruby
framework for web-apps.

I agree.  A clue, or even more than a clue is always needed in such a
project.  I think more of my point is the level of expertise.  If a
project reaches a point of complexity that requires a heavy look at the
database design, and SQL optimization, I'm going to team up someone who
has that expertise, not expect it from every developer.

Ouch.  A jab from an attempt at humor.  In my case billable competency
is a team effort.

Well, to my shame, I brought down a website just this past week due to
a mistake with the query.

I took a query that looked like this "select * from blah where (this or
that or the-other)" and changed it to "select * from blah where (that
or the-other)". "this" and "that" were semi-redundant
("field<linux_epoch_of_now OR field == 1"). The table had about
1,500,000 rows. With removing this OR clause, I changed which index the
query used from one with a cardinality of about 35000 to one with a
cardinality of about 1,500,000. The search slowed down to about 200
seconds per search, which caused the entire website to crash; they get
about 280,000 unique visitors daily, and I just overloaded the system.
All the web servers using the database went off-line, all the
replication slaves went off-line, and I couldn't back up my change
because the database was off-line (no authentication ... etc.)

I know, now, _why_ what I did broke the system. But before then, it was
"just remove one semi-redundant subclause in the OR clause."  Web
developer; not so much a database expert, apparently, though I'm pretty
good in general with construction of SQL statements. 

My point is- web developing without being a db expert ... can cause
problems that would not otherwise crop up.

Sorry; I forgot the smiley there. I'm learning Rails now, and it IS an
interesting framework. or rather, set of opinions. One of the opinions
is that you can fix most database problems with hardware. And it's true,
you can. But it's not elegant, and (cue DHH flying into a rage) it
doesn't scale.

OK, I'll go with the team approach, up to a point. In my experience, the
best developers know enough about everything they're working with to
make good decisions, and to improve on the sub-optimal ones. 

One of the best programmers I ever worked with said that programmers do
two things: debugging and enbugging. Enbugging is relatively easy, and
does not require much knowledge outside of the syntax of your chosen
language (this is clearly a ridiculous exaggeration, OK?).  Debugging,
on the other hand, requires deep knowledge of almost everything your
code touches. Ergo a programmer can be more productive with a deeper
understanding of databases, if the app touches a database.

I wrote a long rant, then deleted it, on this topic.

Suffice to say that I believe that people who take on obligations,  
that can affect other people, should also assume a level of  
*responsibility* to those other people who they can affect.

Useful for a solo demo/test site, yes.

Add a few million users, or a few million records, and I would guess  
that a good 99% of the tutorial examples and wikis in existence are  
not only wrong for such a scenario, but they are actually wrong in  
such a way as to significantly impact the material lives of other  
people. Medications lost, equipment destroyed, sex offenders let out  
of prison after a one day sentence... It's Y2K every day when people  
seriously consider the idea that "managing data is unimportant in  
writing programs that, well, deal with data".

DB request overload: DoS, Security
DB fragility: DoS, Security
DB table confusion: Bad UI to work with the tables
Bad DB table design: Bad UI to work with the tables
DB design not managed: Unit tests provide incomprehensible results

If the developer is code competent in *anything* that involves piles  
of data, they absolutely need to know DB work. The DB could be flat  
files, a RDBMS, whatever, but efficient data management is often a  
good way of separating the app coders from the desktop technicians  
who fix the "drink tray".

A fairly simple test is to ask 20 different programmer applicants to  
design an address book DB. You *will* likely be amazed at the  
variance in the results.

They just have to understand the basics.  Practically speaking, most
web-apps are just front-ends to a relational database.  And unless you
understand how a relational database works and what it's good at doing,
you can't design an application that makes effective use of it.

The DB *expert* is useful when your WikiBaySter/Web-2.0/Folksonomy site
takes off and you can't upgrade fast enough to keep up with traffic.

Web-servers are just glorified FEPs,

I'm not sure if this is what I want, and I've never done it before. Anyhow, here's what the problem is: I have a Qwest DSL account, without pop mail, but I wish to use pop mail. My Hevanet account, which included pop mail, has not yet expired. I can still receive such mail, as before. However, when I attempt to SEND smtp mail, it does not go through:

"The message could not be sent because one of the recipients was rejected by the server. The rejected e-mail address was 'koppr at hevanet.com'.

I guess Qwest does not forward it. What do I need in order to accomplish this?

I have a comcast email account (expired for a year+) that still
receives mail, but I cannot use it to send mail.  I think it's common
practice for ISPs to terminate accounts in this fashion.

If you cannot send mail through the account via a telnet session or
other reasonably clinical means, you're probably out of luck.  At this
point, your choices are to secure an email account with some other
provider, or set up your own email server.

Some possibilities for email account providers:

     - web hosting service
     - private linux geek who is set up already
     - yahoo, gmail

To run your own email server, you will need a domain name and a static
IP address.  The static IP address must be obtained from Qwest, and
your monthly fee will go up.

If you use Qwest DSL, your modem is probably an Actiontec modem/home
router.  These stink for the home linux nerd who wants to run his own
firewall and stuff.  There are other modem options, but you'll have to
buy the modem yourself (and probably support it yourself too).  I'd
bet there is good modem choice advice to be found on this very list.

I found setting up my own email server to be a fairly extensive
project.  But it was fun and rewarding, and I became proficient in
many areas as a result of my efforts: firewalls, DNS name servers,
mail servers, imap servers, SSL and SASL, to name some.  For the true
linux nerd, setting up a mail server is like playing arpeggios on the
violin; an essential technique-building exercise.  I wouldn't hesitate
to dive into the task, but I'd plan a month of Sundays worth of time.

I went with postfix and courier-imap for my mail server, with a
postgresql backend, and postfixadmin for account administration.  Once
I finally got it all working, it has been running like a champ.
postfixadmin makes account administration a breeze.  It's just a web
GUI that wraps SQL queries.  You can get the same result by issuing
the right SQL queries from a psql shell, but it's more laborious that
way.

Being a gentoo user, I went to google and typed in "gentoo wiki
postfix postgresql" and got these links:

Robert-
Its because most ISP's block outbound email that isn't from their same
netblock, so when Hevanet's server's receive your request and see that its
from a Qwest IP address they block it based on that, blame spammers. You may
want to ping Hevanet support and see if they have any authenticated SMTP
servers available which would then let you send email after you have sent
your username and password and its been verified by Hevanet's SMTP server.

Or just use Qwest's SMTP for sending email.

Subject: [PLUG] Easiest upgrade to RH Enterprise 5
Message-ID: <20061227022225.GA6294@gate.kl-ic.com>


The next few days I will descend into laptop reconfiguration hell - where
I want to end up in a few months is with a Redhat Enterprise Linux 5
clone.  RHEL5 is still in beta, and the clone I plan to use ( Scientific
Linux, like Centos with longer support ) will follow the Redhat release
by a few months.  But I want to do most of the work now, before major
job activity hits.

The question is, will it be easier to do the upgrade from RHEL4, or
from Fedora Core 6?  I will have to acquire and compile a lot of 
non-distro packages, and I will probably get into dependency hell 
either way, when I do the final upgrade.  But perhaps someone here
has seen RHEL5 beta and can guesstimate which of the currently
available options is the easiest starting point.

My hunch, and it's only that, is that Fedora Core 5 would be the 
closest jumping-off point. FC6, nice as it is, is a bit too new; 
there's no way its current package set could have gone through all the 
vendor testing necessary for RHEL certification.

You might try asking the Scientific Linux or CentOS maintainers; 
I suspect they'd know pretty intimately.

Or White Box?

Can't you start with the RHEL 5 beta? That's usually available as a download.
Then just track the source RPMs on the Red Hat site.

I recently got a Samsung 205BW; it works great.  In addition to the X
configuration the others have mentioned, I found I needed to adjust the
XRANDR settings; in FC6 it's the "Screen Resolution" program under
System->Preferences.

Dell Inspiron 5100 P4 2.8 Ghz...  I had to call Microsoft to install to
vmware.  My girlfriend had to reinstall an OEM version of Windows XP 
directly on her Celeron desktop and ended up having to call, she 
didn't change any hardware.  Neither one of us was trying to install 
to a different computer.  How is Microsoft supposed to keep a call
center staffed indefinitely for people to call in and reactivate 
their copy of Windows?  If Microsoft is underpaying people in India,
is this something any of us should be supporting?

As far as Vista being the last version of Windows, who believes this
claim?  I certainly don't.  Weren't we all hearing one version of NT 
for everyone in the near future back when 98 came out?  There is a
"server" edition, "pro" edition, and "home" edition of Windows today.
Will there be just one version of Vista? 

If you have a lot of custom software for NT4.0 that you don't want to
port to something else, that can be a good enough reason to keep NT 4.0.
If you want to run Linux, but all you have is a 486 DX-4 120 with 64 
megs of ram, you are not going to run the latest release of gnome on it.
These old systems lack the necessary processing power and bus 
speed to host the latest crop of fully featured Linux distributions.
I have one, I run Redhat 6.2 on it.

There will come a time when you don't want to fight activation
mOgerly.  A time will come when having to call someone will be 
asking too much of you, especially if the call center ever shuts 
down or you lose phone service and can't call out.

With XP, it sometimes decides that a key has been used for activation
before and it won't accept it again.  This behavior seems to be 
truly random.

Why mogerly are you defending WPA by saying that it's not the 
big deal as I'm making it out to be?  I've seen ReactOS bashed 
by people who say that Windows is cheap and WPA is no big deal.
You'd think WPA isn't controversial at all listening to some
people talk about it.

I am glad that the FAT file system was never clamped down on.  It's
shocking to hear that Microsoft is trying to throw yet another file
system they are developing in house into the Windows universe.  If
Microsoft wants Vista to be better, it should use open source 
high quality GPL'ed components the right way in it.

Because of the spam issue, I question the idea of using Qwest's smtp
server to send email and another ISP's email account to receive it.
Because of SPF, sender protection framework, someone could say that
heavanet accounts aren't hosted by Qwest and reject email from you 
based on that.  If you can keep your heavanet account open and forward
email from your qwest account to it, then as long as you use Qwest
credentials with your qwest account you should be fine.  Downside, if
you want people to send to a qwest email account you will have 
to inform them that your email address has changed.  If you want from
qwest with a reply address of heavanet, you'll have to set that up
in whichever mail user agent you use.  This means you'll have to
think, "I'm doing something different," if you use any qwest supplied
web based email interface.  If you want to make sure the reply-to
doesn't go to the qwest account...

Getting a static ip and domain name to do an email site 
allows one to keep the same email addresses no matter which 
DSL provider is chosen.  Unfortunately, Comcast is out for 
doing your own domain unless you want to mess with dynamic 
dns.  Too bad there isn't a competitor to Comcast offering 
static subnets at a reasonable price.  I don't buy Comcast's, 
"putting everyone on dynamic ip addresses makes managing our 
network easier," comments by the way.

If you go to http://register.com/, 
you are looking at $35/year adjusted down for people who pay for 
more than one year at a time.  I would imagine you are going to
pay at least $5 per ip for static ip addresses.  There is also
probably going to be a bridging fee because the Actiontec will
need to be programmed to stop doing NAT and reprogrammed to 
silently pass packets across qwest's network onto yours and 
vice versa.

What I am curious about, can you dynamically map a domain name to
a dynamically assigned ip address?  It's safer to have someone
intercept your email for you in this case and you grab it 
later via pop.  The problem with trying to dynamically change 
the dns address of your email server is the delay for those 
changes to propagate across the Internet.  Stale information 
could cause email to be routed wrong and get lost.  Setting 
up SPF would be difficult, I guess you'd have to know the
subnet you are being assigned out of and allow every single 
ip address in it.  The latter isn't a very secure plan.  In
essence, you are better off going with a hosting service if 
you don't have your own static subnet on the Internet.

If I were to start my own ISP, I wouldn't put anyone on random
ip addresses.  Everybody would be static, but I'd offer dhcp
service and a web interface to allow customers to configure 
it that want to use it.  I'd also provide dns service standard 
for those who don't want to do dns on their own servers.  The
trick, keep intentional ip misconfigurations from interfering
with other customers.  Instead of an email service, customers
do their own email servers and they can forward to a filtering
server that I provide for them if they want it.

I haven't seen either RHEL4 or RHEL5, but given a choice like that I'd
point to RHEL4. They'll provide /some/ support for RHEL4 to RHEL5
upgrades by making conversion utilities. With FC you'll be completely on
your own, even if there is some limited surface similarity. There *will*
be some compatibility with RHEL4 due to having to support commercial
customers.

I wouldn't be surprised for RHEL 5 to be similar to FC4 or earlier for
that very same reason. The key point is there are no guarentees, and in
this situation that tends to point to the conservative option, RHEL4.

Subject: [PLUG] Saving mailing lists with mutt
Message-ID: <20061227231344.GA19197@gate.kl-ic.com>


Handy tricks for mailing lists and mutt:

Some mailing lists rewrite the From: in the mailing header to show
the list, while others indicate the show the list in the Sender:
line and leave the original From: intact.  

I use mutt, and often save interesting mailings from lists in 
appropriately named mail folders.  For example, I save most things
from pdx-pm-list in the "perl" folder.  However, I get the mails as
individual files with From: lines of the authors, not the list, which
makes saving more interesting.

For lists that rewrite headers (like the plug lists), I can use a
simple save-hook line in the .muttrc file, like so:

save-hook "lists.pdxlinux.org" +plug

This only looks by default at the From: line.  However, I can make
it look at the whole header with:

save-hook "~h pdx-pm-list" +perl

... and that will apply the save-hook to any file that has pdx-pm-list
anywhere in the header.  If that string appears in a subject line, I
may have to redirect the save manually, but chances are I want to save
it in perl anyway.

I suppose I could get fancy with rewrite rules in procmail, and save
all plug files to a mail folder on the way in, but some things aren't
worth saving.

All you'd have to do is:
:0:
* ^TO_.*pdx-pm@
perl

The procmailrc manpage explains the TO_ macro. It's very handy. I can't
imagine manually saving list email :)

Yeah, well, that's how e-mail works. SPF breaks much more than what
you've described, which is why it'll never work.

There's nothing wrong with sending mail through your ISP's server for
any domain you'd like. Just check to see that the domain you're sending
as isn't publishing SPF records. (Hevanet isn't.)

If the domain in question isn't publishing SPF (chances are good.. most
people know SPF is a horrible solution) then you don't have anything to
worry about.

Keith,

   Nice geek approach. I use pine and have procmail recipes that sort mail
list arrivals into the appropriate files based on the 'To: ' line. It's
worked here for a number of years and is very easy to maintain and enhance
as necessary.

   In my naivete, I consulted Occam's Razor which said I was using procmail
as the MDA so why not let it do the sorting regardless of the MUA in use?

Red Hat does mention FC6 as the source for RHEL5 on their own website;
in this case, the conservatism is reflected by the fact that RHEL5 is
more than 6 months late (compared to their target 18 month version
cycle for Enterprise).  

It turns out that the RHEL clone that I use, Scientific Linux, has a
version 5 alpha on their site (as a heap of loose RPMs, they haven't
built a distro yet).  I think what I will do is load S.L. version 4.4,
then attempt to upgrade it with those RPMs

And why am do I use Scientific Linux?  Compatability and support. 
Some of my CAD apps and other proprietary (sadly) stuff want to
install on a major distro, and all support RHEL.  S.L. made a lot of
improvements for the technical and scientific user.  S.L. is run on
the huge compute clusters at various government and academic labs, and
they don't change them much after the initial install, beyond bug-fixes
and security updates.  That fits my needs well.  Fermilabs has four
full time staff working on S.L., with the goal of supporting and
updating all their versions into the very distant future, much longer
than Red Hat.  So even though I have no problems with paying for RHEL,
it would reach end-of-life too soon, before I want to upgrade.

I wouldn't fault Microsoft for this, unless they react badly.  Finding
flaws is what beta test is for ("beta than nothing" as they say). 
My real worry is that the bad publicity will cause them to shoot the
messenger, scale back their beta testing process, and postpone the 
outside bug-finding process until after major release.  All new
software contains flaws that are only findable by outsiders.  Eric
Raymond says, "with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow." Every bug
found now is one less that could torment tens of millions of users
in the future.  We should celebrate these flaws.

So while there are a lot of things I don't like about Microsoft, bugs
found in betas are not one of them.  Open source software has many more
bugs on initial release, and relies on community involvement to find
them.   Over time, the bugs are found and the software becomes really
robust and bug-free.  I would like to see Microsoft release betas much
sooner, and let the world find the flaws sooner, before the flaws
become cast in stone.

I'm looking for insights on phone/pda combo's.

I like the look of the ones that open up and have a full keyboard.

I use MS/Outlook now but I'd like to transition to something else like
Thunderbird.

I've gotten the impression that syncing with something other than Outlook is
rare.

I want to find a device that can sync with my desktop for things like
schedules, contacts, notes, etc.

I've had problems in the past getting repeating appointments and tasks to
sync.

Any insights appreciated.

I believe RHEL4 --> RHEL5 is a supported upgrade path.  Considering that 
CentOS is a rebrand of Red Hat, I would expect the same upgrade path to 
work.

RHEL5 Beta 2 is based on FC6.  Mixing FC and RHEL often works, but can 
also cause problems so I would not recommend mixing them if you are 
considering upgrading it.  Unless you really want/need virtualization, 
RHEL4 works well.

I've been running RHEL5 Beta 2 and adding in FC6 packages via yum on an 
as needed basis for packages not in RHEL5 and it works fine.

File: /etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf that needs to be renamed,
removed or lines commented out before that message goes away.  Got
bit by it on my last install.

It is listed on the test/welcome page pointing to the exact file if you have a
configuration that is different.

Charles,

   For almost six years now (anniversary in a couple of weeks) I've been
happily using my Kyocera QCP-6035. It's a PalmOS PDA (I think equivalent to
the Palm III) and a cell phone. It will also do text messaging and more, but
I don't have any need for that stuff.

   There are newer models (color screens and I don't know what else). It has
worked flawlessly for me all this time; it lives in a full leather jacket
and has survived being dropped on the ground a half-dozen or so times. I've
upgraded the firmware two or three times and the local Verizon store.
There's also the Palm Treo but I've never used anything but my trusty ol'
6035.

   Since about 1998 I've used Judd Montgomery's jpilot desktop. It works with
the standard pilot link library. It's worked for every PalmOS PDA we've had
from the Personal through the Handspring Visor Pro; serial and USB. Look at
<http://www.jpilot.org/>. It's run on Red Hat (4.1-7.3) and Slackware
(8.1-11.0). Judd's a great guy and has done a terrific job with this tool.

   I won't buy any device that runs any flavor of Microsoft; that's my
preference. The PalmOS works just fine for me. There are several linux-based
PDAs, but I don't know if any of them include a cell phone.

I have commented out those lines and have been able to put an index.htm file
in the directory which will show up as an index. After clicking on the index
icon my text shows. But I am unable to get straight to the web page without
the index and I think that may have something to do with being a subdomain
as the place I have my domain name will not allow me to point that one to my
server. Obviously time for a change.

Thanks for the info.

What file extension are you using? .xhtml? If so you probably need to
edit your httpd.conf file and add index.xhtml so it will be the first
file apache will look for. Just add it right after DirectoryIndex and
leave what ever other files are listed there. It might look like this:

DirectoryIndex index.xhtml index.html index.htm index.php

A Treo is the way to go.  I have the same Kyocera that Rich mentions,
but you can no longer get new service for it due to its lack of E911 or
somesuch.  But I don't miss it; my Treo 650 is so much nicer--the color
screen is much more usable in low-light and much higher res, so Google
Maps[1] is actually usable.  It has enough CPU power and an SD expansion
slot so it's also quite capable as a music player.

And yes, it syncs with Linux.  Kinda.  The data formats for calendar,
contacts, etc are well-supported, since they haven't changed much over
the years.  Actually syncing with the stock 'visor' kernel module is
spotty; it works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't.  I don't think it's
seen much love lately.  pilot-link[2] has finally had a new release
after 3(!!!) years, which includes support for talking directly to the
device via libusb, instead of having its access mediated by a kernel
module.  From the little testing I've done, it's much faster and works
reliably, but currently requires to be run as root to be able to
open /proc/bus/usb/* as it needs.

I'll second the Treo recommendation.  I love my Treo.  I cannot live
without it.  It has decent support on Linux, which is to say, the best
that you will find with any other cell/pda combo right now.  PalmOS
has the largest variety of apps.  Lastly, and this should not be
understated, they have the best interface for a pda hands-down.  I
switched temporarily to a Blackberry, but couldn't use it due to zero
linux support, but also because I could not get used to the interfaces
for entering data.  Once you start entering data into your Treo, you
will not be able to use other interfaces because they are inferior,
IMHO.  This goes for the PocketPC Treo; I'd stay away from that.

What does your cell phone provider support?

The best bet would be the Treo 650 or 700p.  Not an option if you use
Qwest^wQworst.

Does your cell phone company allow you to use unlocked phones on their
network? Some do, some do not.  If not, what do you have to choose from?

The Treo 650 has the new Contacts and Calendar PIM applications which
changed the format of the databases.  Syncing them with Evolution or
other PIMs no longer works.  The pilot-link guys are working on adding
support for the new databases. There are compatibility databases for
the old-style programs but those sync as empty databases.

I use pilot-link to backup my Treo and to install programs.  Sending
files over Bluetooth works well.  Mounting the SD card over USB also
works.  My impression is that Windows Mobile does not work nearly as
well with Linux or Mac.

Hrm, really?  I'm pretty sure I've sync'd mine with Evolution; contacts
at least.

Yes, CardReader is the app I use; when activated, the SD card is
presented as a standard USB storage device, which makes managing music
and other files very easy.  I haven't determined if it's actually
FAT-aware or if the presentation is really at the device level, so (for
instance) it would work with an ext3-formatted filesystem.  Haven't
needed to, really.

I'm with Verizon. Looks like the Treo700p is what they offer.
Anyone have direct experience with it?

Maybe I'm speaking ignorantly here, but that's exactly how I solved my 
problems with AOL, Yahoo and Hotmail.  My mail was getting rejected or 
automatically dumped into the spam bin for those providers when I tried 
to send direct from my own server.  My reverse DNS and PTR records are 
fine.  dnsreports.com say everything is good on my end, yet nothing 
would fix the actual problem, but that.  I set my mail server to forward 
to my upstream providers SMTP and all is now well.

Are you kidding?  It's much easier to push out mass IP that way.  I 
would like to know how static is easier to manage if you can point me in 
a direction.

Bah, as I said; spiritone.com :)  Business accounts get four static 
IP's.  Consumer accounts get one.

All I can say is if you really think about it, and think about the 
future, dynamic IP's are a nice thing to have.  I'm not saying there 
aren't any perk's to having static IP's, but from a management side 
there are a lot of perk's to DHCP as well.

I'll third it - I have two Treo 650s (one for personal, one from work).
Both sync well with Evolution.  The PalmOS is pretty open and supports
developers - there are tons of apps for it (I strongly recommend mOcean,
DateBook6, FreeChecking and HandyShopper.  Some cursory research on the
BlackBerry resulted in my impression there aren't many third-party apps
available.

Subject: [PLUG] two sound cards 
Message-ID: <BAY125-F107292530A78B74102C102B8C60@phx.gbl>


Hi:  I have a need to have two sound cards on my linux box.
My motherboard comes with a soundcard and it is a VIA AC97 controller.  That 
one works fine.

I just added a PCI soundcard which is 'Creative Labs SB Audigy LS'.
And I have modprobe snd-ca0106.
My onboard sound is /dev/audio and the Creative PCI card is /dev/audio1.
I have run alsamixer -c 1 to make sure nothing is mute.

I have split my input source to two, one going to my on board sound card and 
the other going to the Creative card.  I could never get any sound coming 
out of the Creative sound card.

I have tried all that I can think of.  I am looking for tips/pointers on 
what else I can try to debug this "no sound" problem on my Creative sound 
card.  And I presume there is nothing to prevent me from having two sound 
cards under the same box?

Thanks

--Vincent

I have a couple of friends with one.  They look nice.  They run palm 
software. I have heard that the 700p does not support the wireless sd 
cards, but the 650 will. (For those who want to scan for wireless networks 
with their phone. Tricorder sounds optional.)

They are not cheap, but no PDA phones are.

The 700p is the next generation; the resolution on the camera is much
better and there is more memory.  Aside from that and some packaging
differences, I don't think they're all that different.  Last time I
checked, though, VZW still offered the 650 and it was considerably less
than the 700.

This is actually just backwards--the 600 and 700 have Palm-supplied SDIO
WiFi options, but the 650 has only the option to use a 3rd party WiFi
adapter on the sync port (and it costs more too).

> They are not cheap, but no PDA phones are.

With contract and rebates, it's only about $200, which is expensive but
not nearly as expensive as the MSRP.

I would also like to mention, the Treo works fine as a bluetooth modem for
Linux if you want to connect to the net.

One note, I have a Treo 650 and my wife recently got a Treo 680.  Of the
two, the 680 is not only cheaper but it's a nicer phone overall.  Without
the bulky antena bump on top the Treo 680 feels smaller and it also has
about twice as much memory available.

Another awesome phone is the Motorola E680i.  I had a coworker with one of
them, it ran Linux and it could handle things the PalmOS phones can't like
ssh tunneling vnc sessions and stuff like that.  Unfortunetly, it's hard to
get the E680i in the US since Motorola doesn't sell it here :-(

Now wait a minute Charlie, I'm not so sure SPF is a terrible solution.
It requires a new notion be followed that email for a particular domain
has to come from specific servers.  This is supposed to cut down on
allowing bot machines to flood the Internet with garbage.  How else can
you publish which servers on the Internet are serving your email?  If
I'm not mistaken, there is a special SPF enhancement for ISP sites that
forward other domain.

Now instead of saying, "SPF is a terrible solution...," how about 
posting a link to a web page explaining your opinion or giving your
reasons directly?

Hi,

A fresh install of OpenSuse 10.2  running NAT, iptables, DNS and 
postfix works great except mail is not being received, with or 
without iptables rules.

'ps aux|grep post' shows master, pickup and qmgr are running.

'telnet [either interior or exterior ipaddress] 25' shows "connection refused."

nmap shows port 25 is listening for 127.0.0.1 but not for the 
interior or exterior ipaddress.

'netstat -l' shows localhost listening on 25 but not for the interior 
or exterior ipaddress.

tcpdump shows lots of DNS queries for MX.  nslookup gives the correct 
mailserver address.

Any tips appreciated.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

   I don't do tips -- except for wait staff in restaurants.

   But, here's a reference to the appropriate chapter in the good Postfix
book: <http://www.postfix-book.com/debugging.html>.

   Also, what do the logs say? Specifically, /var/log/maillog.

   I've had situations where a typo or other silly oopsie! caused a fatal
error that throttled the exec file. It's all in the log; not the source of
the problem, necessarily, but the overt results.

I dont know your exact config, but what happens if you tail
/var/log/mail.log in on terminal and do a /etc/init.d/postfix stop and
then /etc/init.d/postfix start? Are there any errors in the log?

Keep in mind that it is not a T1. It is still broadband and you are still going to get the same promises for outages time to repair etc..

Have you read through /etc/postfix/main.cf (assuming standard placement)?
The comments are pretty explanatory about what each option does and how to
configure it.

Specifically the comment:

  # The inet_interfaces parameter specifies the network interface
  # addresses that this mail system receives mail on.  By default,
  # the software claims all active interfaces on the machine. The
  # parameter also controls delivery of mail to user@[ip.address].
  #
  # See also the proxy_interfaces parameter, for network addresses that
  # are forwarded to us via a proxy or network address translator.
  #
  # Note: you need to stop/start Postfix when this parameter changes.
  #
  #inet_interfaces = all
  #inet_interfaces = $myhostname
  #inet_interfaces = $myhostname, localhost

would seem to indicate the source of your problem.

I would guess SUSE is being "helpful" (or you accepted a config for local mail
only) and restricting mail acceptance to localhost.

My comment was directed towards this "Microsoft is trying to restrict
legit use more than piracy".  If you're experience is much less 
tolerance from Windows for installed software or re-installation w/o any 
hardware changes, I'm not disputing that.  I just look at it as 5 to 10 
to minutes out of your day when it happened.  Does any other software or 
OS do this?  Well no for the most part but more are jumping on the 
"activation" bandwagon all the time.  And they're certainly not doing it 
to discourage legit users.  You're in a small minority. I would be 
surprised if MS hit 5% of a legit install base of Windows in some Asian 
countries.  This and casual copying is why WPA exists.

The desire to run commercial closed source software is no more wrong 
than a person who prefers open source, it's just different.  Both come 
with caveats.  I bet you've spent a lot more time hacking away at why 
some app didn't install/run or compile on your linux machine 100 fold 
more than WPA took out of your life, right?  I know this is the case 
with me and using FreeBSD, but I know this comes with the territory.

As I said, Win9x is still supported with what updates are still 
available via Windows Update.  The same will be with XP.  You can 
speculate all you want, but it is years away when anything on this will 
be known either way.

You can run NT4 for as long as you like.  Just like *any* OS which has 
reached the end of it's life cycle, you just need to take the proper 
precautions for where it's used, be it public or private in nature.  But 
eventually when the only hardware available never had drivers for NT4 
written for it, you'll port. :)

For now, activation is small on the list of things I don't like about 
MS.  Far more important to me are their business practices among other 
things.  Personally I see myself owning a Mac as my primary computer in 
the future, or getting to the point FreeBSD can be what I primarily use. 
  I'm tied to it because of a couple apps though.

> Why mogerly are you defending WPA by saying that it's not the 
> big deal as I'm making it out to be?

eh, it's "m0gely".  You know, like in the Disney flick, but l337? ;)

Because in my experience, it's not.  I know some people have had bad 
experiences with it, and for some more recently it has even involved 
re-installing the OS to make WPA happy.  This would suck.  I just know 
it's not true for the masses, and dispute your implication that MS seems 
to be targeting legit users more so than piracy.

> I've seen ReactOS bashed 

Eh, good luck to them, but they are not a realistic option in any 
regard.  They run a *very limited* set of actual Windows applications, 
none of which are productivity based.  It's just not even a 
consideration.  What does ReactOS have over Ubuntu?

I maintain an offsite virtual colo for $21 a month, with two static
IP addresses.  I manage 13 domains and all their email through that.
Besides having mondo bandwidth (10GB/sec) to the facility in Dallas,
if my home office goes down the mail gets spooled on the colo until
it comes back up. 

The virtual machine is a Xen image, so if the Dallas site goes down
it (and it would probably take a nuclear weapon to do so) then the
image migrates to London or Brisbane.  I reach it through an
outbound OpenVPN link from my firewall (on Comcast), which has no
incoming services.   Because my DNS is at Dyndns, I can change colo
providers in minutes, and because I have no inbound services I can
change ISPs quickly, too.  The only real weak point is Dyndns, and
at least the name service is cached if they go offline.

I use rimuhosting for the virtual colo because they provide prompt
and outstanding 24x7 service.  I hope to return to a local company
someday, if one of them develops similar stability and service; 
perhaps if the small companies banded together into a mutual support
network, I could get the same features I get from rimuhosting.

Chris-
Not that I'm aware of. Its in a format that only the mysql command line
client can read but I don't believe you can just copy the data files out and
re-read them in, I tried this a few years ago and it failed miserably but
may have been due to version incompatibilities. If you're able to create an
actual dump of the data that would be much easier to work with but i'm not
sure if Yahoo offers that.

Good Luck and let us know how it comes out!

On the topic of email I heard through the grapevine that Gmail is going to
offer the ability to get email from any account from within the Gmail
interface in the near future so that could resolve all your problems right
there.

<tangent about DHCP versus static>


I've worked for several ISP's and currently a telecom provider and  static
is just not feasible in the long run if you want to scale to anything larger
then a small mom and pop operation (not that there is anything wrong with
that).

>From a managment standpoint DHCP is much easier but requires more upfront
work (DHCP server, Accounting/Radius). If you're using a static setup you
risk having only roughly 63 customers per /24 subnet (depending on how its
engineered) so you're looking at additional cost as you grow because you're
paying someone to submit applications to ARIN for new subnets as well as
paying the registration fee's. Of course if you go DHCP then you have to
deal with things like the MPAA and RIAA complaints and being able to
accurately correlate authentication and IP data to a specific account which
takes time and money :-)

This idea could be argued for ever and ever but I guess comes down to the
time and money and engineering you want to put into a network

I have rsynced the entire contents of /var/lib/mysql from one machine
to another on numerous occasions, with the effect of making the
destination mysql instance into a duplicate of the source.  You'd want
the exact same mysql version, as Drew mentioned.

Gmail already lets you send email as any email address that you can
get email for. (They require some simple click-through authentication
to prove that you are the rightful owner of the additional address.)
And you can (almost) always forward email from another service with a
.forward, or similar.

I just checked and you can POP/SMTP from any account via the gmail
interface,  relaying problem solved :-)

You can do static ip addresses with DHCP.  I do this on my own private
network, no problem.  It means that I don't have to do dns updates,
I can keep my dns servers static.  How fast can Internet based dns
servers update for dynamic ip addresses?  Seems you are going to be
stuck having someone on a static address act as a middleman.  The only
downside of static ip addresses via dhcp is that you need your
customer's MAC address and a hostname.  Unless you are only a client 
and not a server, I don't see how dynamic ip addresses are ever a 
good idea.

Sure it's less work to randomly hand out ip addresses.  It's not a whole
lot less though.  Static assignments aren't a lot of work if you have a
web interface that the customer can access to inform you of: the
hostname they want, the ip address they want it to use, and the reverse
hostname that they want.  You should be able to know which physical
segment a customer is coming in on and if they specify the correct dhcp
hostname, give them the corresponding ip address.  Figure out how to set
this up securely and automate it fully, static assignment through dhcp
ends up being as easy as dynamic assignment.

Why is dynamically assigning ip addresses better than staticly 
assigning them?  What is the advantage of putting customers on
random global ip addresses within a single subnet, or less than
that?  As far as anonymizing people is concerned, having a 
different ip address every time you browse the Internet isn't 
much protection.  Think about it, if someone wants to harass
you and you are 1 out of say 255 ip addresses, that isn't very
many possibilities if they can spy on all them.  Then once they
notice the habits of one of those ip addresses matches yours,
they might be able to port scan the ip address and fire off an
attack.  How often do dynamic ip addresses change?  With Comcast,
you can easily go for a few months with the same number.  

Changing one's ip address frequently doesn't address problems 
with confidential information leaking out of databases on the 
net.  Worse, what if your ip address times out in the middle 
of a large download?  For ip based security, a moving target
weakens those schemes.  I allow a specific ip to come in and
access services, the next minute it doesn't belong to the right
computer anymore.

I can't get lightspeed research for example to leave me alone.
Maybe when I trusted them giving them email information and
possibly more than that, I made a huge mistake.  Right now, there
doesn't seem to be any way to clean up mistakes.  There are no 
Internet cops that can receive an empty me from the database 
order then both investigate and enforce it.  A similar problem, 
being on the government's do not call list is not working for a 
lot of people.  If I do a credit card transaction with company 
X over the Net, I should be able to order that my information 
be removed from their database once the transaction is complete.
What are you supposed to do, use a credit card once on the 
Internet and then cancel it?  Frequent cancellations of credit
cards will probably wreck your credit rating.  

What makes me really angry is when a company like Opus 
Interactive double charges a customer's credit card.  They 
insist on having it on file and won't take checks anymore, 
yet supposedly the DSL service they offer is month to month 
and not contract based.  If there is no contract, why on 
earth does Opus have to have your credit card on file?

<Aside>
Whether it's http://www.ccleaner.com/ or some other site does
it tick anyone off that there are often these you have won something
ads and you can't claim it without making a purchase?  These ads to
me seem like illegal schemes, yet they appear to be rampant across
the Internet.  The lightspeed research outfit gives you this do surveys,
earn points, get stuff pitch.  It's a lie, you never have enough points.
In the meantime, you might mistakenly trust a BBB icon and a Verisign
symbol and foolishly hand them your soc number.

Why combine a cell phone and a palmtop?  As far as video
telephony goes, most people don't want to pay for broadband
on a portable phone.  Phones are pretty simple devices, why
complicate that?  OSS software seems to have been slow to 
penetrate the palmtop/PDA market.  Are there any efforts 
to design a palmtop or PDA specifically for Linux users?

A PDA that is wifi and Linux ready makes a lot of sense.  I don't
understand all the hype about bluetooth.  My impression is that 
it is a hobbled wireless technology.  IR is badly hobbled these 
days also.  

IR was hobbled supposedly because students were cheating on tests 
by communicating with someone remotely using the IR feature of their
calculators.  I have no idea why you can't change the design of
classrooms to deal with IR abuse or simply flunk cheaters instead 
of ruining a superb technology.

There seems to be a lot of resistance to developing and selling OSS
controlled devices in the US.  I have a hard time accepting that our
laws are strongly against doing so.  It seems that few US companies 
see the economy of scale that can be achieved if they design popular
consumer electronic devices which are 100% Linux compatible in the first
place.  You shift from making money by having a niche through a trade
secret to bulk producing a quality product that people want and can use
with OSS software.

With palmtops and PDAs, you have a small screen to work on and usually
no keyboard.  These problems aren't easily solved unless someone
perfects holographic projection.  You can't make the picture
bigger by attaching a huge LCD monitor.  Does it make sense to pay
for and have the equivalent of a high end computer in a palm top
form factor?  I don't think it does.  With the restrictions, it makes
more sense for the machine to be a personal organizer and scientific
calculator than a full blown computer.  Show me a $100 palm top that
can: be used to connect to evolution and ical on a full sized computer,
be used as a scientific calculator, be used to scribble notes on, and be
used to keep contact information handy.  And oh yeah, I want a credit
card slot on the side of it so I can keep track of my credit and debit
card balances by simply swiping them when they are used and entering
the amount that has been withdrawn or deposited.  It would be nice to
tweak checkbook tracker for this.

Ubuntu uses proprietary enhancements that are likely to disappear
or otherwise not be carried forward into the next release.  ReactOS
doesn't use any proprietary code.

What productivity application that require Windows anything are you
referring to?  

For 20 programmers, ReactOS is doing well supporting some Windows
software.  Instead of saying it isn't an option, why don't you go to
http://www.reactos.org/ and join the development effort?  There is
plenty of participation for Linux to develop further.  Someone tries to
make a GPL'ed OS that is 100% compatible with Windows XP and 2000, there
is practically none.  Why is that?  There is potential, plenty of it.
2009 for a stable release time line is worrisome, but it's
understandable with only 20 programmers that it will take that long.  XP
came out in 2002, so that's only 7 years to come out with an
alternative.  Maybe more people will care about ReactOS when it gets
further along, but that is just the problem with projects.  They often
don't get off the ground because people despair when their support is
needed most.

Porting of software to Linux and FreeBSD from Windows isn't something
that is happening very often.  ReactOS is a project that is an effort 
to work around this problem.  I think they are doing pretty well
considering that all 20 of these programmers have to support themselves
via work outside the ReactOS project.

How many years went into developing XP?  At least 2 years went into it
and probably 4+.  Granted, ReactOS has been developing for 10 years.
How long does reverse engineering take when you are trying to make 
sure that you are doing so legally and you only have a limited number 
of programmers?  Never mind that there are limited resources.

The idea of a an OSS OS that you can go to from Windows where you won't
have to retrain makes a lot of sense.  With a future plan to give
ReactOS the ability to run Linux software, people can migrate from
ReactOS over.  ReactOS is trying to do one thing Microsoft has
abandoned, make the NT platform efficient.  Microsoft doesn't keep it's
application and OS people from unduly influencing each other.  There are
apparently going to be a ton of inconsistencies in Vista.  Vista has a
virgin network stack and probably more fresh code.  Security wise, this
is a disaster.  Microsoft is saying that Vista is the most secure system
they have ever developed already.  I bet the day of the official release
that someone will crack it.
