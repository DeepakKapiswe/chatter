I think I remember reading somewhere that Thinkpads are one of the most 'Linux Friendly' laptops out there (just check out any linux-for-laptops pages out there, heck even FreeBSD-for-laptops pages--oodles of thinkpads). I would hope so, seeing as IBM has invested so much in Linux (I still get a kick out of their Linux server commercials.."um, I'm David *A* Brown"...)..

As does one of these.  (Flashbacks of snipping resistors, bumping up the

And the vid capture.

Robby;

Execute the following (minus the '$' sighn, that's just the prompt):

  $ du -hc /directory/to/view/size/of

Just to be super-cool, if you wish to see the list of files sorted from
the largest to the smallest, perform the following:

  $ du -k /directory/to/view/size/of | sort -rn | less

See the man page on du (man du) or drop an email on this list for
details about du.

It will be fixed when Woody is released.  Once again, on the Debian
archive server itself, if you were to log on and "ls" the directories,
you'd see that "woody" is a real directory, and there's currently a
symlink to it named "testing".  "sid" has a symlink to it called
"unstable", and "potato" has one called "stable".  At release time, the
symlinks will be changed, so at that point, "woody" will be symlinked to
by a link named "stable", and the ``bug'' in the installer will just
disappear.

Yes!  "dselect" is semi deprecated at this point -- "aptitude" is much
easier to use.

Yes, that can happen when the archive is in flux.  It happens in
"unstable" and "testing" on a regular basis.  It will generally
stabilize within a week or so.

"aptitude" has a much better interface for this problem than "dselect". 
I think you'll find it much less frustrating and confusing.  The archive
flux will never go away, we hope... That's just it's nature.  Debian is
a moving target (hence the swirl logo, or "torn fedora").

It's such a racket.  We don't need to spend on it.

If you click the button to view the cert, doesn't it display the
information I entered when I generated it with "mod-ssl-makecert"?  You
should be able to "accept forever" and have it not dialog at you every
time thereafter.

Message-ID: <1025546461.9568.37.camel@juniper>

Try the "killall" command, part of the sysvinit package.  You can kill
processes by name, rather than by PID that way.  Also, the "ps" command
has several useful switches for determining the run state of a process. 
Look for one that will show you the "WCHAN".  Sometimes things get stuck
in disk I/O, and cannot be killed.  Usually then though, they are not
spinning the CPU.  I guess if it can spin the CPU, then it probably can
be killed.

I most often run:

ps wwwauxf | less

or use "kim" or "gitps".

I just noticed that in "unstable" (sid), "dselect" has been split out
into it's own package.  (It used to be part of the "dpkg" package.) 
This is a sign that perhaps "aptitude" WILL become the preferred
interface, and will hopefully be the one mentioned in new books and
manuals.

What!?  

Splain this:
I got the same error pattern on two different hard drives:
  1. perl5 package (perl_5.6.1-7_i386.deb) is corrupted
  2. When I tried to get rid of it (so I could apt-get install it) by using 
apt-get clear (clean?)  I got error mesg that ext3 was corrupted.
How in the world can this happen.  BTW, I successfully installed RH7.2 form 
CD on the second HD so I'm pretty sure it's OK.

Yes, the IBM ThinkPads work well execpt for that all-too-common WinModem
problem.

Unfortunately, IBM has cancelled their Linux on ThinkPad program.

http://www.bm-soft.com/~bm/archives/200206/msg00090.html

This doesn't mean that support for the older models will get worse, but it
does mean that support for the newer models is no longer assured.  I
thought this was an odd move for a company which actively markets Linux.

FYI, I've had good luck on my Dell Latitude CPi A.

On RH 7.0 + systems /etc/init.d is a symlink to /etc/rc.d/init.d.
This is to bring RH in line with Linux filesystem standards. Just
creat the symlink and you should be good.

I have no expereience with laptops or pcmcia cards, so any help would be

More info:

dmesg shows:

In fact, there are three seperate lines of that.

ifup eth0 returns the message the eth0 is not found and ifconfig only

Perhaps "alien" can turn the .deb into an .rpm that will function?

  The absolutely disgusting aspect about this is the basic premise that
computers are used only as replacements for TV/VCRs and stereo systems. This
does not acknowlege that computers are used for database applications, word
processing, finance and accounting, scientific computations or anything
else.

  Can you imagine Ford, Nike, Boeing, Nationwide Insurance and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency agreeing on such hardware/software restrictions
on their computers?

  The greed and narrow focus on a segment of personal, end-user use of
computers as a means to greater profit in a saturated market is
disheartening. I suspect that this will not fly too far before it crashes in
flames.

Take a step back and generalize the functionality.  Don't think about
particular applications here, just general functions.

If I may be so presumptuous, allow me to restate your sentences above in
terms of general functionality:

"The absolutely disgusting aspect about this is the basic premise that
computers are used only to display and copy information.  This does not
acknowledge that computers are used for recording and manipulating
information."

Personally, I think they (the capitalists pushing for these regulations
and technological limitations) recognize those facts better than you
perceive.  The whole purpose of these limitations is to keep control of
the means of production in the hands of the few.

Our technology is outstepping our society.  We're reaching our goals
faster than the people want to accept the rewards.  The entire purpose of
science and technology and the original intent of capitalism is to provide
abundance and improve the human condition.  Control of the means of
production in every person's hands (and, therefore, to use the modern
parlance, empowering individuals) is fairly universally recognized as an
important step in improving conditions for all people.

These people and systems (because systems are a kind of living thing with
a sense of self-preservation) are working very hard to use their power
held over from the age of scarcity to prevent the coming of the age of
abundance.

These organizations will receive special dispensation from the regulations
by way of their massive accumulated wealth and power.

Personally, I don't think we're turning this particular bus around until
we cancel the line or shut down the freeway (if that metaphor is at all
distinguishable from gibberish).

 It is not just computers they are doing this to, currently the FCC
has approved DRM for Digital TV. So you won't be able to record
anything from a DTV broadcast unless the broadcaster or copyright
owner says so.
 I don't think Mary and Joe consumer will like this and once
corporate america tries to ram this down their thoat there will be court
cases and people won't buy the products. You mean I can't rip this CD
to my HD if I buy the new Windows machine or be able to record my favorite
show without their permission?
 They are cutting the hand that feeds them and in the long run it
will never last.
 I'm all for turning off people that violate copyright law, the
problem is that they are denying fair use and time shifting. The
1982 SCOTUS ruling about VCR's will most likely be used as a club
to stop these silly attempts to stop people from time shifting
and making legal copies.

/etc/rc.d/pcmcia status?

I'm guessing here, but I thought I saw a similar question and this was the answer. I don't have pcmcia stuff myself...

Here are some ways to check on PCMCIA:

# grep pcmcia /proc/devices
[Is the device there?]

# lsmod
[Is there a line like:]
pcmcia_core            41632   0 [optional stuff]

# fgrep pcmcia /var/log/boot.log
[Did it start up OK when you booted?]

If all that checks out, then look at:

Here's what has happened to me a few times:

Since the pcmcia service starts after the network service, eth0 may not
initialize on startup. If:

/sbin/service pcmcia status (essentially the same thing that Russ
recommended)

says the pcmcia service is running, try:

/sbin/service network restart

and ifconfig again. 'Course I'm just now realizing you said that ifup eth0
didn't help, which should accomplish the same...

Does your link link illuminate and card beep when the pcmcia service
starts on bootup while running all the /etc/init.d/rc.d stuff? Is pcmcia
even starting (back to Russ' question)?

Look at the recent history and see what really happens in these
situations today.

First and foremost, the products will continue to be bought.  There will
be no other choice.  The alternatives are pulled away because those
markets are dominated by the same corporations that are bringing the new
products.  And society simply IS NOT structured to work around abuses of
power.  There is no ability to provide for the needs of the community
within the community, no shared experience outside the media, and no
respect for ideals other than "every man for himself" and "you can't blame
them for trying to make more money".

Second, the law suits (those that actually see a courtroom) will not (nay,
cannot) be brought by individuals.  Human beings don't have the necessary
wealth and stamina to endure a lawsuit against a major corporation.  
(There are a small handfull of counterexamples, but they are statistically
negligible when compared to the number of suits dismissed or derailed
because a person could not afford to fight a corporation or a
conglomerate.)  Instead, you have lawsuits brought by "watchdog groups"
and lawsuits brought by other corporations seeking to make a dime or
twenty on selling products that work around the DRM.  The first are viewed
by the population as radicals or "causies" or whatever and easily
dismissed.  The second are either consumed or driven into the ground by
the larger corporation in the deal.

In Betamax, Sony fought for the right to sell recording equipment to the
public and won, but now Sony owns Columbia and is a member of the very
organization it fought against in 1980.  The last fifteen years have seen
unprecendented consolidation and conglomeration of all wealth and
industries into the hands of a very few.  None are left with the capacity
and desire to fight against this hegemony.

> You mean I can't rip this CD to my HD if I buy the new Windows machine

Yep.

Oh, well, then I'll make due with my old music until the marketting
machines drive me into the ground and I just HAVE to get the new Celine
Dion.

As I've written before, two situations might arise from this battle:  The
capitalists will win and all human endeavor will have a price tag and an
inventory control number or the people will win and there will be free
exchange of ideas and information.

I honestly can't say which one is more likely at this point.  My human
spirit tells me that the latter MUST prevail because the former just
couldn't happen.  But all indications are, at present, to the contrary.

Existing copyright law or realistic copyright law?

Nope.  The rules have changed.  The DMCA was not law in 1980 when Betamax
(Sony v. Universal, et al.) went to trial.

And, of course, there's the standing interpretation by lower courts that,
somehow, "digital is different."

Message-ID: <3d213bc4.7721.0@pcez.com>

This is what's great about Linux.  I was interested in getting a Thinkpad to
run Linux, but had questions. People from this group -- Geoffry, Richard, Matt,
Jon Terry & Greg -- helped me out quickly. Now I can move forward. They helped
secure the sale for IBM.

I'm a little torn though, because getting the new system means contributing
to Bill's coffers. And trust me, I need my money more than he.

After 10 Windows-free months, I'm now using a new PC running XP at my new job.
It spits up just as many error messages as any Windows I've ever used. What's
so great about XP?

After all the ballyhoo about XP, I kind of expected it to be an improvement
over NT, which I had been using in the past. Heck at least when Linux comes
out with a major release, there's actual, noticable improvement.

This is just speculation, but it seems that the large hardware manufacturers 
are dragging their heels adopting XP.

I recently bought an Epson scanner at Fry's (Perfection 1650, which works 
great under Linux btw) and ran into an affable salesman who told his own 
tale of woe.  He bought a scanner (don't remember, maybe an HP) based on the 
claim that it was XP-compatible.  However, the driver cd that came with the 
unit had no XP support.  He finally discovered that there was no XP driver 
yet, but that if he put his name on a list, he would be notified when one 
was available.

It sounds like most windows people are happy with 2K and hardware oems are 
being very conservative toward XP.  Think I've read that it's more like NT 
in the miserable driver department, whereas 2K inherited its compatibility 
from the 95/98 lineage.  But I could be talking out my ass...

It has all them new perty colors and it completely takes over your applications...I had a coworker/friend call me one night because she had opened calc or some odd application from the start menu..she went back later and XP had moved it or something (apparently it does something like 'learning' your preferences, kind of like what Office 2000 does with lesser or more used functions) - and she wanted me to tell her how to find it again...I could only smile a big cheesey grin as I told her, "Sorry, hun, I only do Windows at work because I HAVE to...I know NOTHING about XP...you're on your own..."

We Linux/Unix/*BSD users may be a little zealous and seemingly over-excited by that 'command line OS' at times, but we often have good reason. :)

I've had a number of strange interoperability problems.  The strangest was
how version 3 of OpenSSH refused to authenticate via public key to an
OpenSSH 2 server.  I never did figure out why it wasn't working until one
day after a routine upgrade things magically started working.

If you need to get OpenSSH talking to F-Secure SSH, then look into the key
import/export features in OpenSSH.

I also sometimes have good luck running a separate sshd in debug mode
(-d) on a strange port and trying to connect in there.

Last but not least, make sure each SSH can connect locally using the
public keys.

The thing that is pissing me off currently is the lack of
keyboard-interaction authentication over ssh connections when the
server side is using this new privilege separation.  Makes it tough to
bootstrap authentication from new locations.  If anyone has a
reasonable solution to that one, I'd like to hear it.

The cgi-bin directory's status is defined in your Apache server's 
configuration file (try "locate httpd.conf" to find it). Look in that

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.31.0207020528440.6213-100000@eel.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

A good forum to discuss the non-GPL ramifications of the TCPA
might be the cypherpunks list (www.cypherpunks.to). Ross
Anderson's FAQ and the TCPA's website are good resources too.

A lot of people predict TCPA will crash and burn like similar
initiatives unpopular with the tech community (UCITA, Clipper, etc),
but TCPA already has the sponsorship and participation of almost all
tech-related companies, a lot of non-tech, media-related companies, and
even nonprofit, consumer groups. While it's quite possible Palladium
(Microsoft's attempt to cut ahead of the TCPA) will crash and burn, it
seems probable, given the years of effort and planning they have spent,
the TCPA's goals will be realized in one form or another; the question
to my mind is how their certification scheme will be governed.

Going back to the GPL, Ross Anderson, author of the TCPA FAQ, believes
TCPA will break the GPL because it will force re-evaluation and
certification of the binary every time it is released (see below).

In his analysis, Anderson assumes a highly centralized certification
scheme where developers would lay down a lot of money to get their
software certified. I don't think this would necessarily be the case in
a distributed system of certification though. For an account of how such a
system might work, try: www.cs.orst.edu/~creelan/tcpa-benefits.txt. In
this scenario, free or open-source software is actually a benefit. --Tyler

--- Ross Anderson: TCPA-Linux and the GPL ---

Making a TCPA-compliant version of GNU/linux [by HP]
will mean tidying up the code and removing whatever features conflict
with the TCPA security policy. The company will then submit the pruned
code to an evaluator, together with a mass of documentation for the
work that's been done, including a whole lot of analyses showing, for
example, that you can't get root by a buffer overflow.

The business model, I believe, is this. HP will not dispute that the
resulting `pruned code' is covered by the GPL. You will be able to
download it, compile it, check it against the binary, and do what you
like with it. However, to make it into TCPA-linux, to run it on a
TCPA-enabled machine in privileged mode, you need more than the code.
You need a valid signature on the binary, plus a cert to use the TCPA
PKI. That will cost you money (if not at first, then eventually).

Anyone will be free to make modifications to the pruned code, but in
the absence of a signature the resulting O/S won't enable users to
access TCPA features. It will of course be open to competitors to try
to re-do the evaluation effort for enhanced versions of the pruned
code, but that will cost money; six figures at least. There will
likely be little motive for commercial competitors to do it, as HP
will have the first mover advantages and will be able to undercut them
on price. There will also be little incentive for philanthropists to
do it, as the resulting product would not really be a GPL version of a
TCPA operating system, but a proprietary operating system that the
philanthropist could give away free. (There are still issues about who
would pay for use of the PKI that hands out user certs.) The need to
go through evaluation with each change is completely incompatible with
the business model of free and open source software.

People believed that the GPL made it impossible for a company to come
along and steal code that was the result of community effort. That
may have been the case so long as the processor was open, and anyone
could access supervisor mode. But TCPA changes that completely. Once
the majority of PCs on the market are TCPA-enabled, the GPL won't work
as intended any more. There has never been anything to stop people
selling complementary products and services to GPL'ed code; once the
functioning of these products can be tied to a signature on the
binary, the model breaks.

Subject: [PLUG] lilo: fails to open
Message-ID: <200207021447.g62ElEa15672@smtp.easystreet.com>

I'm trying to multiboot dos, rh7.2 and debian.  I'm working in rh and trying 
to modify a working lilo.conf to include  the debian partion, which I did by 
copying the rh7.2 stanza and changing the root part. When I run lilo it fails 
to open the debian image file.  Here's my lilo.conf:

prompt
timeout=50
default=linux-redhat
boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
message=/boot/message
lba32

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.7-10

        initrd=/boot/initrd-2.4.7-10.img
        read-only
        root=/dev/hda2
        append="hdc=ide-scsi"

        root=/dev/hda4
        append="hdc=ide-scsi"

other=/dev/hda1
        optional
        label=DOS
The error msg is: Fatal: open /vminuz: No such file or directory. I can mount 
hda4 under rh so I know the file is there.

They've always tried to do this... it used to be easy for cost reasons.  But
as cost drops...

Example: Audio production

Pure cost of entry used to be the big barrier.  That started to come down
rapidly.  When digital recording arrived, a huge drop loomed.

So they used legal means to cripple/restrict the equipment.  (Serial Copy
controls, licensing, etc.  Keeping the price on equipment artificially
high.)

But then, a loophole... generic equipment already excluded (by law) from
those restrictions gained similar (and eventually more) functionality than
the lower end specialized equipment.  The barrier is not gone, but only as
high as knowledge and a little investment. (Much smaller than it used to
be.)

They're trying to close the loophole again.

Grrr!

(Is it time to move this one over to TALK? :)

Hi Bill,

When I set up a triple boot, one winders and two debians, I had a
separate lilo.conf for the second debian partition.  The master boot had
an extra other=/dev/hda4 to kick in the lilo loaded on the second debian
partition.  So I only had one image specified in the master boot record,
and 2 entries for "other=".  I think this will work best, because you
need to be able to modify the boot record for the second linux partition
independent of the boot record for the first linux partition (like when
you compile a new kernel).

Hi All,

Evolution just crashed on me :(  OK, I know I'll get that sometimes,
comes with running Sid (unstable debian).  The real problem was the
recovery.  I was able to kill off all Evolution processes, but when I
tried to start it again, it came up listed as "down" in the WCHAN
column.  It's parent ID was the window-manager.  I tried to kill -9 with
no effect.  I then killed the window-manager and the parent ID for the
downed evolution changed to 1 (the init ID).  It still wouldn't die. 
Being out of ideas and mailers, I did the only thing I could think of,
reboot.

I'm just wondering, was that my only option, or is there a way to reset
or kill processes that are "down"?

Thanks

Derek Loree

While the file may be there, the file system it is on has to actually be
mounted and the file "/vmlinuz" must actually be in that location in your
current active file system when you run lilo.  Most likely you wouldn't
want to do it this way anyway, because this makes the lilo configuration
for the two different versions of linux dependent on each other, every
time you run lilo from either version of linux, you would have to make
sure the configuration has been updated for the other version.  The best
way I know of to do this is setup your master boot record to point to the
boot record for each partition using the "other=" approach, then for each
version of Linux setup lilo to install on the partition boot record.  So
you would run lilo once with a configuration like this:

   boot=/dev/hda
   default=redhat

   other=/dev/hda2
        label=redhat

   other=/dev/hda4
        label=debian

   other=/dev/hda1
        optional
        label=DOS

This will setup the master boot record for the drive to allow selection
between the partitions.

Now for each linux partition setup your lilo configuration file just to
modify it's own partition boot record.  For your RedHat partition use
something like this:

   boot=/dev/hda2

   image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.7-10
        label=linux-redhat
        initrd=/boot/initrd-2.4.7-10.img
        read-only
        root=/dev/hda2
        append="hdc=ide-scsi"

and for the lilo configuration on the Debian one use something like this:

   boot=/dev/hda4

   image=/vmlinuz
        label=linux-debian
        read-only
        root=/dev/hda4
        append="hdc=ide-scsi"


NOTE: I left out all the other options to make it clear what was being
tinkered to do this, you will still most likely want some or all of the
other options in each of these files.

It's been quite awhile since I last did one of these, so hopefully I
didn't leave anything out.

While you might be correct that there is a /vmlinux on hde4 that is not
the file that lilo would be looking for.  It would be looking for a file
in / of the system that you are currently running.  Try one of these
options.  Either copy the file to the system you are currently running,
or mount that partition and give it the correct path to the file in
lilo.conf

Message-ID: <20020702130658.40ec9f22.russj@dimstar.net>

I can't believe that I'm the first one that wants to do this. 

I have a perl script that already gives me text. Splits it into fields and everything.

I want to put that text in an xml file. 

What I need is a perl module that I can feed the text to, and it will return the same text, modified so any greater-thans (>) are &gt, etc. Yes, I can probably write a translation, but someone must have already done this, right?

Also, I may be looking at this wrong. If there are already modules that will take my parameters and write valid xml, let me know.

Specifics please. I've been searching CPAN and google for several days and haven't hit on the right search or found anything close to what I'm looking for.

Thanks in advance!

HTML::Entities::encode () may do what you want.  I don't

Did you try runing "kill-ev" or "oaf-slay" to kill all parts of
evolution and all the little bits and pieces that it uses before
rebooting?  That's always worked for me.

Thanks for the very clear explanation. But while trying to do this I ran into
Fatal: First Sector of /dev/hda2 doesn't have a valid boot signature. I 
looked at it with fdisk and it is marked bootable.  What am I missing?

This could be done using XML::Simple.  This just converts a perl hash to
an XML file.  It requires a good understanding of perl's complex data
structures.  ("man perldsc")

If you need something more flexible (i.e. more complex) then XML::SAX is
probably what you want.

If that is truly all you need, then HTML::Entities is what you want.  But
why not let perl do the hard XML work for you, too!

Done.  ;-)

How about this for XML::Simple:

http://search.cpan.org/search?module=XML::Simple
http://www.web.co.nz/~grantm/

And for XML::SAX:

http://www.saxproject.org/ [original java version]

Have fun!

There is no kill-ev on my system.  What are OAF processes (there is no

You need to have a second lilo.conf for your redhat partition that will
write a boot record to /dev/hda2.  However, this isn't necessary, for
your master boot record, just use 

boot=/dev/hda
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.7-10
         label=linux-redhat
         initrd=/boot/initrd-2.4.7-10.img
         read-only
         root=/dev/hda2
         append="hdc=ide-scsi"

    other=/dev/hda4
         label=debian

    other=/dev/hda1
         optional
         label=DOS

Then run lilo on your debian partition with a lilo.conf that looks
something like: 

boot=/dev/hda4

    image=/vmlinuz
         label=linux-debian
         read-only
         root=/dev/hda4
         append="hdc=ide-scsi"

HTH, and was a little more clear.

oops, I should've typed "killev" rather than "kill-ev" - sorry about
that!

I'm no expert, but from what I've gathered from lurking on the evolution
mailing list OAF stands for "Object Application Framework" and is the
replacement for Gnome's CORBA implementation for Gnome 2.0.  I believe
the components of Evolution (calendar, mailer, addressbook, etc)
communicate using OAF.

no man pages exist for either killev or oaf-slay, but both are perl
scripts that you can peek into (at least they are on my system) if
you're curious as to what they do.

I think it is complaining that there is no bootstrap on the /dev/hda2
partition yet.  I'm not sure at this point if it went ahead and installed
the master boot record or not, this may simply be a warning rather than a
fatal error, since it doesn't really need for there to be a bootstrap on
the partition in order to install the master boot record.  To be safe, you
could run lilo with your redhat configuration to initialize the /dev/hda2
boot record, then re-run lilo with the configuration to initialize the
drive boot record.  Of course it will probably complain about your Debian
partition too if that partition has not yet had a boot record written to
it.

Thanks, my system does have a killev, and running killev --help just
killed evolution, completely!  I'll try it next time evolution crashes.

I'm a little wary of the oaf-slay, because it doesn't take any arguments
that would narrow down the things that I might want to kill, what if
another application uses OAF that I don't want to kill?

Hi.  I am a Linux neophyte, and I am looking for some help setting up
my current installation.

I've installed Red Hat 7.2 on my NEC Versa laptop, and was able to get
everything configured except the wireless lan PCMCIA card. (Linksys
WPC11 2.5)

I've done some reading online, and I can't find a definitive guide for
getting the card to function.  I was hoping that someone on the list
might have already done this and would be kind enough to walk me
through it.

Much appreciated,

Mike.

Mike,

I don't have a laptop w/linux installed, so I can't take you by the hand
through 802.11b/PCMCIA land... but at the risk of asking the obvious, did
you snarf the correct driver for the card?

http://www.linksys.com/download/driver.asp?dlid=59

where you'll find this link for "Linux Driver"...

hth,
Sandy

I have a pop3 mail account with gmx.net in Germany and all was working fine 
until this weekend.  Now I have 67 messages stuck in the queue and they're 
not coming out.

I have telnetted to port 110 and authenticated in, deleted the top message on 
the queue (several times).  This has worked for me before when someone sent 
me something too big.

I have sent a email (in english, with a german apology) to 
postmaster at gmx.net, but no avail.

Anyone know any good tools to debug pop3? 
Anyone have any suggestions on how to fix it?

Sean

You're absolutely right.  Working from RH I ran lilo -C liloRedhat.conf, 
which put ? on hda2, then lilo -C liloDebian.conf which put ? on hda4, then 
lilo -C liloOthers.conf which put ? on hda, and, MY GOD, it all worked.   
Before when I ran lilo -C liloOthers.conf it complained about both hda2 and 
hda4. I mistakenly thought it had somehting to do with making partitions 
active which it doesn't.  Thanks to all for the help. I think I should now 
learn Grub :-)

Now what's wrong with this. I used dd to copy a kernel to a floppy, but when 
I tried to boot from it I got a 'compression' error

Visit http://www.personaltelco.net - the local wireless community
is very active and you'll find good information there.

If you have built a kernel with 2.4.18 sources the hostap driver
is very easy to set up.  

If you do have the drivers installed and recognizing the card perhaps
all that is stopping you is setting the channel and ESSID for the
host node you are attempting to contact . . . .

Hello Folks,

We've had some construction delays that have left us without a good
place to hold our Software Freedom party so we're moving the date to
Friday, August 30th.

The location will be at our new high school computer lab full of brand
new K12LTSP terminals.

I know it's not the same as doing this on the 4th of July but you'll
have more fun in the new lab and you'll at least be able to get into the
room, something we can't do right now! ;-^)

I'll send out reminders later in the summer.

Looking forward to having seeing you all there!

;-) Paul

The local wireless nerds operate a few publically accessable wireless 
points in town.  See http://www.personaltelco.net/

Sites include:

	Billy Reeds on MLK
	Pioneer Courthouse Square
	The south park blocks
	Psychonautical Suppy (bookstore) on Belmont
	The youth hostle on Hawthorne
	The Pittock Block in Downtown

How new is your car? If it's comfortable and has cup holders, you could go to 
Starbucks and then just drive around...

I know for a fact that there are lots of unsecured wireless networks.

There's a newish cyber cafe just off Hawthorne on 32nd (half block south 
on the east side of the street, within eyeshot of the Lanai Cafe). You 
might be able to plug in there.


Someday FREE GEEK intends to offer a real drop in access space, but 
until then, volunteers there (anyone can help) can use the classroom to 
connect, though the environment can be distracting and the presence of 
coffee is iffy, but it's free (for anyone volunteering at FREE GEEK).

Win-XP Search Assistant silently downloads files
By Thomas C Greene in Washington
Posted: 11/04/2002 at 20:47 GMT

Just over a week ago, while searching for a file on a Windows-XP machine, I 
was surprised to see the Search Assistant attempting to activate my Internet 
connection. It puzzled me because I wasn't searching the Internet, only my 
local drive. I was busy with other things at the time, but I made a mental 
note to look into it soon, which I promptly forgot to do. 

This morning, Reg reader Jody Melbourne rattled my cage, fresh from having 
made the same discovery. He'd noticed that the Assistant was establishing a 
connection with a machine at Microsoft. 

"I did not give Microsoft permission to know what files I am searching for on 
my local hard-drive," Jody wrote. 

Indeed, and neither had I. So I connected an XP box to my ISP, started a 
packet sniffer, and launched the Search Assistant. Sure enough, it 
immediately connected to http://sa.windows.com/ and fetched a number of 
files. But it didn't attempt to send any data to the site, beyond comparing 
my locally-stored versions of those files to the ones on the server. 

But when I performed an Internet search, the Assistant sent my search terms 
to the Microsoft site, and also dropped a session cookie on my machine. 

Phoning home? 
One of the files the Assistant fetches is the MS Search Companion privacy 
statement. This is done for P3P compliance. According to the statement, MS 
doesn't collect information about local searches. "No information is ever 
collected by Search Companion when you search your local system, LAN, or 
intranet for any reason." 

I certainly didn't pick up anything to contradict that. But there is some 
obvious collecting when SA is used to search the Internet. 

"When you search the Internet using the Search Companion, the following 
information is collected regarding your use of the service: your IP address, 
the text of your Internet search query, grammatical information about the 
query, the list of tasks which the Search Companion Web service recommends, 
and any tasks you select from the recommendation list." 

"Search Companion does not record your choice of Internet search engine, and 
does not collect or request any personal or demographic information. 
Information collected by the Search Companion cannot be used to identify you 
individually, and is never used in conjunction with other data sources that 
may contain personal data." 

Hopefully there aren't too many loopholes in that, though I rather think the 
user's IP can be considered personally identifying. However, MS tells us that 
the policy statement is out of date. IPs were logged for testing purposes 
during the XP beta period; but since the product launch, there has been no IP 
logging. 

In addition to the privacy statement, the remaining files fetched are XSL 
(Extensible Stylesheet Language) stylesheets: 
transform.xsl 
balloon.xsl 
prevectr.xsl 
vector.xsl 
boolean.xsl 
pretrans.xsl 
transform.xsl 

Users curious to know exactly what they contain can quite easily locate them 
on their local machine and have a peek. According to MS, they're simply used 
to maintain up-to-date associations between file extensions and file types, 
to make searching more productive. 

I'm not acquainted with XSL, so I'm in no position to affirm that or to argue 
with it, but I'd be pleased to hear from readers who can shed additional 
light on the subject. 

For now it appears that there's nothing here for users to worry about. But 
there is a question about MS playing fast and loose with people's Internet 
connections. Certainly, the minute one ventures onto the Web, one starts 
bleeding information all over the place, fetching images and ads and taking 
cookies from secondary and tertiary sources too numerous to mention. 

But when we run an application for some local business like a file search, we 
don't expect it to connect silently to the Net, even for a good reason. When 
we discover something like this, it feels like someone else is in control of 
our computer, and that is definitely not a good feeling. 

If Trustworthy Computing is going to mean anything, it's going to have to 
mean that actions like file downloads aren't going to happen without the 
user's knowledge and consent. A simple popup asking if one wants the latest 
XSL files with the options to decline, to be asked each time, or to grant 
permission to go ahead without further consultation is all that would be 
needed.

Maybe the people who actually read the GPL and the Debian Social Contract, 
and who equate commercial success with making money? It's certainly a success 
on its own terms.

This is just wild-assed speculation, but it might have to do with
Aracnet's brief SMTP outage a month or two ago.  Maybe these are
bounces being resent.  I recently got one of my own messages, but
others had responded to them at the time and I got those.

What sort of hardware and software is needed for this kind of wireless
access? I'm about to purchase a new notebook and would like to be able to
get access wherever I can find it while traveling, especially in Ireland.

(Most likely I'll get an Apple iBook w/ G3 processor. and dual-boot it
with Linux, and I have zero knowledge of networking in general, let alone
wireless, so any comments would be helpful.)

Subject: [PLUG] sed regex to strip html code
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0207031053430.14943-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I'm trying to put together a one-line sed program that will strip html
codes from a text file and leave the text behind. I've not yet succeeded.
I've tried:  sed 's/\<.*\>//g' <filename> > <output_filename>
and it extracts angle brackets but does not remove them from the file.
Instead, it puts the extracted text into the output file.

  Where have I gone wrong here?

Thanks,

Rich

since the angle brackets are part of an expression enclosed in single quotes 
you don't need to escape them.

Try just sed 's/<.*>//g' INFILE  > OUTFILE

  I've solved my problem using the text editor, 'joe', by doing a combination
of plain text (for the angle brackets) and a regex for all the included
text.

Many tools, plethora of solutions.

While this is possible to do, there are much easier ways.  The main
problem is a lack of a boot loader, something to tell the kernel where
to look for a root file system and how to load the kernel and mount the
file system.  I believe that the kernel will try to mount whatever file
system it finds, not necessarily the one you want mounted.

I have used mkboot to create boot floppies.  This tool uses lilo (which
you are becoming very familiar with) and a specified kernel.  The kernel
doesn't need to be on the floppy (but it can be, if it is small enough),
just the boot record.  Lilo (when using the lilo.conf on the floppy
disk) hardly ever complains when you specify a setup that doesn't exist
or make sense to it.

Good Luck

  Aha! I know (from reading the ORA regex book) that there are differences
among applications and that angle brackets are used -- by some -- to
describe word boundaries. Guess that's why I did it as I did.

Try the find command.  I just checked the man page I think this will do
the trick

find / -type d

That should start at the root and list all the directories it finds as you
have specified.

good luck,

Michael;

Here you go:

$ find /home/cstevens -type d -depth -print -exec ls -ld {} \; | less

Work with the `ls' man pages if you do not with to see the permissions,
acess times, e.t.c.

Alternatively, you could pipe the output to awk like so...

find /home/cstevens -type d -depth -print -exec ls -ld {} \; | awk '{
print $9 }'

Watch the ticks, they are apostrophes, not single left quotes.

For some meaning of "do" and "it".

It'll break on this:

Yes, that's all stuff that should be stripped.  Or try this:

        <div anything="foo>bar">

That will leave _ bar"> _ when it shouldn't.

This is a lot closer:

$ perl -MHTML::Parser -e 'HTML::Parser->new(text_h => [ sub { print @_ }, "dtext" ])->parse_file(\*STDIN)' <<\END

        <!-- > this is still inside the comment, but won't get stripped
        < -->
        And this is outside.  Here's &lt;HTML entities&gt; for you!
        <a href="foo">And here's a link</a>.

END

which generates:

        And this is outside.  Here's <HTML entities> for you!
        And here's a link.

Proper!

This might be reinventing the wheel, but why not use `lynx -dump'? It'll
produce a nicely formatted page most of the time. The bug is lynx only
reads from a file, not from stdin.

Is there any way, programs, voodoo, prayer, that you guys use to check if a 
drive is flakey.

I was having trouble with an install and getting a parse error. I looked at 
the directory where the file, 'available' was and copied one named 
'availableold' over it.  Whereupon the parsing error went away.

This sounds bad doesn't it?

IBM has Drive Fitness Test, a bootable floppy thing-a-ma-jig. They even 
provide a "Linux version", though it's just a floppy image. It _does_ 
appear that the drive to be tested must be an IBM one, as it accesses 
IBM drive microcode. YMMV.

It does seem like most drive manufacturers have something similar though.

It's been my experience that when a drive fails that it writes jibberish to the 
file names and directories, not recognizeable text. I'd suspect a software 
thingy, but the manufacturer of the drive will more than likely have a utility on 
their site. Manufacturers are using the result codes to do troubleshooting, so 
theey don't have to talk to you on the phone.

Message-ID: <1025740694.25465.40.camel@lana.manymoons.net>

First question: how do I find out how much space I have on my swap
partition?  (I am curious if there is some sort of utility or command
line I am not aware of to do this.)

Second: how do I increase it without reformating my entire disk. I am
hoping (wishful thinking?) that I can somehow move some unused freespace
into my swap partition.  When I installed RH7.2 on my laptop, I gave it
256M for the swap, but I am about to add RAM and I know swap should
equal twice the ram.  Maybe I shouldn't worry about it, but if it is
easy enough to do I would like to optimize the machine as much as I can.

/usr/bin/top will do it.  So will /usr/bin/free.  I used "man -k
memory" to remind me about the latter one.

I don't think the 2x memory thing is true any more.  Some of the early
2.4.x kernels had that problem (I think it was), but the more recent
ones I think don't.

If you really want to repartition, you could check out "GNU parted".
I think that's what I used to repartition the laptop computer to
install linux originally.  To do it safely, you need to follow a
series of steps that I've forgotten, but that involve defragmenting.
Note also, you can have multiple swap partitions, so don't feel the
repartitioning has to be adjacent to the current swap partition.

I concur, but thought it was because most systems have more than enough ram 
nowdays.

I have occasionally come to regret a particular partitioning scheme (like 
when RH started to use /var heavily for apache and ftp homes).  I can vouch 
for Partition Magic v5.0.  Resizing and moving are easy and it handles ext2. 
  Probably a newer version will advertise ext3 (though I don't know if it 
makes a difference to PM or not).

Not free, but not expensive.  You'll need access to a windows box to create 
the two boot floppies.

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

My understanding was that it was a deficiency/characteristic of the VM
code.

Duh!  Forgot about that.  Too obvious.

I wasn't really sure.  Just saying what I heard.  Still, my laptop is
doing a lot disk IO and is much slower than I would have expected.  I
thought that a larger swap + more ram would take care of both those
issues.

I'll check out GNU parted.  Thanks.  I am trying to save money, so I
really don't want to buy anything, if I dont have to.

That may well be.  The 2xRAM has been rule of thumb since the birth of 
Linux.  Don't know if it was because of VM back then or something else. 
Looks like the VM wars have been settled, like you said in early 2.4 (~one 
year ago.)

Funny thing happened when I upgraded a laptop w/256MbRAM from RH7.0 to 7.3.

Weird.  Never heard of it.

I stopped using a swap partition on my desktop machine and I can't say
I've looked back.

I started plotting out the values yielded by running `free -M` and found
that the cached value was always more than the Swap: used value.  I
figured the extra disk I/O for reading data currently cached would be less
than the current disk I/O for accessing a swap partition.

My drive is quiet almost all the time and things run pretty snappily.

Keep in mind, of course, that this machine has 1GB RAM.

It was 1xRAM (16M minumum) prior to 2.4.0 (2.3.something actually).Then it
went up to 2x. With the new VM in 2.4.10 it went back to 1x. With disks as big
as they are these days however, there's no harm in erroring on the generous
side.

Stay away from 3com 3C460B usb to ethernet on any OS.  I bought two of them 
and fought with them for 2 months before, in someone made an offhand comment

Okay, that sounds familiar.  I think my first machines were so starved that 
I always doubled the swap partition.  The laptop's swap is at least 1x, 
(probably 2x knowing me).  I have done the same upgrade to RH7.2 on other 
machines and not been forced to create a swap file, so the mystery remains.

Then again, RH warned in flashing lights that /boot be greater than 
something like 80M!

Quick search of google gives this interesting pages:

Looks like you need to have mx entry in dns of the receiving mail

in /etc/aliases (maybe /etc/mail/aliases), put a line like this:

user: user at anotherdomain


Then run "newaliases" for it to take effect.

Another way is to use procmail or a .forward file in the user's home
directory.  That way, the user can change where their mail is forwarded if
they need to.

I'm sure this is because when Red Hat does it's kernel upgrades via
up2date they don't remove the previously installed kernel by default. So
in effect you could have multiple kernels installed filling up /boot if
you have it as an independent partition.

On that note- How the heck does somebody do this? I've got a couple of old 
kernels in my /boot dir, but I have been afraid to remove them. I've hacked lilo 
to make it boot the new kernel by default, but that's as comfortable I've been so 
far.

For some reason, (fear of screwing up really bad) redhat has not had many rpms
that delete old kernels for a long time now. If your not booting from a kernel and
you don't think you'll need it for anything, you can delete it. If your not sure
if you need it, have a copy of toms root boot handy, rename it, and reboot.

Absolutely: find's -exec switch is very expensive. If you want to be 
even safer, then null-terminate your find-ings to handle directories 
with spaces or other odd characters in the name:

  find / -type d -print0 | xargs --null ls -ld

Which makes me-thinks the easiest way is

    find / -type d -ls

... and avoid "exec" and "xargs" altogether.  (OK, so you 
get a couple extra columns of information at the front of
each line ...)

rpm -q kernel  or  rpm -qa | grep kernel
to see what kernel versions you have installed. 

rpm -e kernel-2.4.foo-bar
to remove any kernel versions you do not wish installed. I have yet to
have a system problem removing old Red Hat kernels once the new one is
installed. And typically the kernel source is replaced with the newest
version if you have the previous installed.

When mail is sent to non existing users, the bounces get copied

this mail is 99.9% spammers just randomly trying addresses.

   Support EFF While Recommending Your Favorite Books

   So you've always wanted to set up a books page where you can recommend
   your favorite books and people can follow a link to order them from
   the bookstore, but you don't want to give a bookstore all your tax
   information so they can send you a $25 check every few months. And,
   you certainly don't want to send business Amazon's way because they're
   software patenteers.

   But just as it would be hard to tell people to "burn all GIFs" without
   a drop-in replacement, here's a drop-in replacement for Amazon:
   Powell's. They meet my four tests for a good bookstore:

   1. A reasonably secure, or at least not on crack, software platform.

   2. A sound privacy policy, including mail by opt-in only.

   3. Good selection.

   4. Working access for all browsers.

   So go join the Powell's partner program.:

   http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/amazon.html.

   This is from Paul Barton-Davis, one of the founding programmers at
   Amazon:
   http://www.op.net/~pbd/amazon-1click.html.

   But doesn't Amazon run Linux now? Well, Powell's runs MySQL.:
   http://www.mysql.com/articles/us/powellbooks.html I have the gut
   feeling I'd rather support a company that runs Apache and MySQL on
   legacy Solaris than a company that runs Oracle on GNU/Linux. Somehow I
   think this is a reflection of a quick-and-dirty estimate of how many
   person-hours of conversion work they are away from running all-Free
   infrastructure, not just "Larry Ellison is a fascist".

   So, yes, Amazon runs Linux, but like I said before, they're evil. Just
   ask Google.

   "Amazon is evil" -- 24
   "Powell's is evil" -- 0

   So what do you have to do to get on Scientology's page of
   "Anti-Religious Extremists"?:
   http://www.religiousfreedomwatch.org/extremists/

   I am a committed opponent of the DMCA and all who use it to censor
   others--that puts Scientology on my dookie list. And I have bad
   habits, in case Scientology needs to say mean things about me to let
   me qualify. I am now advocating the campaign to get everyone to link
   the word "Scientology" on their web sites to www.Xenu.net:
   http://www.xenu.net/. For an example of someone doing this, see the
   Doc Searls' weblog:
   http://doc.weblogs.com/.

   Freedom lovers had Xenu.net up to number one on Google for a while,
   and now it's down to number three. Don't let those smug Hollywood
   hustlers get away with it.

   If you have the word "Scientology" linked to the official Scientology
   home page, please consider changing the link to point to Xenu.net, as
   it has more accurate information than the official CoS site. Also, if
   you know somebody who can get me on that page of "extremists" that the
   Church of Scientology doesn't like, that would be sweet.

   Tim O'Reilly is smoking the Libertarian Loco Weed.

   Tim O'Reilly writes:
   http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2002/06/28/vendor.html: "As
   I've long made clear, I prefer BSD- or Apache-style licenses, or
   dual-licensing schemes such as the SleepyCat license, because I
   believe they allow for a richer ecology of open source and proprietary
   commercial development."

   These approaches, though, are essentially opposites. The
   dual-licensing system with both a copyleft and a proprietary license
   offers more information and constructive feedback to licensees--if you
   want to play the proprietary game, you play by proprietary rules. I'm
   not saying the BSD-licensing model is bad for all software, only that
   the dual-licensing scheme offers important features that a
   non-copyleft license alone does not, and there are important reasons
   to prefer it instead of being indifferent.

   The two approaches are very different, and it seems strange that Tim
   doesn't express a preference. But here's the really silly part. He
   goes on to say:

     Of course, this preference is within the context of support for all
     licenses, from the most proprietary to the most free, since my
     primary belief is in the right of developers to set the terms for
     the reuse of their code in a way that best serves their objectives.
     And that includes Microsoft's right to set the terms under which
     they license their own software--but only so long as the user is
     free to accept or reject those terms in a fair marketplace.

   Now, endorsing the right of a developer to choose any license is the
   same old "any contract between consenting adults should be enforceable
   in court" adolescent technolibertarian wankerism that has made one
   internet forum after another into a tiresome, pointless Ayn Rand-fest.
   I expected better from Tim.

   Unconscionable clauses in licenses are everywhere, and I don't want my
   tax money paying a judge to enforce ex ano notions like a ban on
   criticism of software.

   Isn't it possible to divide licenses into three groups instead of two?

   1. Unconscionable licenses: these contain terms that should be
   unenforceable, such as violations of users' privacy, restrictions on
   criticizing the software and prohibitions on reverse engineering for
   compatibility.

   2. Permissible but non-free licenses: because there's no bright line
   between "a computer program" and "a book about a computer program", it
   probably should be reasonable to license a computer program under
   terms analogous to those that copyright law allows for books.

   3. Free licenses: smarter people than I have trashed many carpal
   tunnels describing this category.

   Saying that it's the copyright holder's right to impose any license at
   all is giving software companies a legal privilege that nobody else
   has.

   Span-Filtering Code of Conduct

   I've had a few good comments on my suggestions for a spam filtering
   code of conduct. Here are the principles in brief.

   1. No filtering is perfect. Make all filtered-out mail available to
   the user somehow; it may be legit mail.

   2. Do not autoreport based on heuristics. Auto-report only mail that a
   human has confirmed to be spam or that is sent to a spamtrap-only
   address.

   3. Don't block open relays unless they actually are being used to send
   spam. A mail server may test positive in a relaying test but have its
   own antispam measures.

   4. Don't autochallenge new correspondents. This is about as rude as
   you can get and prone to causing a bandwidth-sucking challenge storm.

   5. Don't make the Internet an ugly, suspicious place by conspicuously
   modifying behavior to hide from spam.

   Mike Durkin of rawbandwidth.net:
   http://rawbandwidth.net recently sent out the following mail to
   customers:

     As it is our policy to only apply filters to your email if you
     instruct us to, you'll need to visit our control panel at
     http://manager.rawbw.com/email if you want to turn on the filters.
     There are various controls to adjust the filtering action there
     too--you can tell it to just tag suspect spam so you can filter on
     your client, or to move the suspect spam into a 'filtered' mailbox
     on our server. If you choose to move suspect spam to the filtered
     mailbox, you can access it either by using an IMAP client (instead
     of POP) pointed to imap.rawbw.com to log in to your email, or you
     can also see it via our webmail client at http://webmail.rawbw.com.

   This should be a model spam-filtering policy for ISPs -- never take a
   user's mail away. Hooray for rawbandwidth.com for not letting spam
   fighting turn into a mail-blocking frenzy.

   Historic License

   Finally, here's an interesting historic license for you. This is from
   an old 5.25 floppy sleeve, and they apparently don't know what
   software it came with.

   Here's a scan of the original sleeve.:

If your's has the option activated, maybe that's all that really
needs to be changed.

Now, I know we're also not supposed to edit sendmail.cf directly
anymore.  There's some 'sendmail.mc' (I think) which is supposed
to be changed, m4'd, and then a new sendmail.cf is cranked out.

Caveat! I'm not really doing much with mail.  (Just being lazy

  My well-used Gateway-2000 keyboard is losing the spacebar function. This
started yesterday and pulling a pound of dust and dog fur out of the
keyboard hasn't completely fixed the problem. Of course, I've been using
this keyboard for about five years now, and I really, really like the
function keys on the left side and the ctrl key just to the left of the 'a'
key.

  Does anyone know of a locally-available keyboard that works this way?
Twenty years of working on this keyboard layout makes it much more
productive for me.

Those lines are commented out in my config also. Also commented
out: 

#O DoubleBounceAddress=postmaster

Hmmm... it looks like DoubleBounceAddress defaults to postmaster
if it's not set. But these's aren't double bounces that I'm
worrying about at the moment.

I'm looking at "THE WHOLE SCOOP ON THE CONFIGURATION FILE"
(http://www.sendmail.org/~ca/email/doc8.9/op-sh-5.html) and I'm
not finding anything that controls these incoming errors. But
I could easily be missing it :-)

  I can respond to my own post. First, the 142-key board is made by Adesso;
back in 1996 they cost me $50 each. Now they're $120 each -- or higher.

  Second, as I think about my keyboarding, I realize that it was primarily
WordPerfect that makes heavy use of the function keys. Other than moving
from desktop to desktop in Xfce, I don't think that many -- if any at all --
applications in linux use the function keys. The console apps use
ctrl-<whatever> or meta/alt-<whatever> and the GUI apps use the alt key or
the menus via the trackball.

  Perhaps I should get a happy hacker keyboard for my linux use.

  Any and all suggestions greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Rich

If a good keyboard doesn't turn up, one solution is to remap your
keyboard, for example using xmodmap (/usr/bin/X11/xmodmap). This way the
keys are in your favorite positions regardless of the underlying hardware.

For example, I prefer having ctrl in both the middle and lower positions,
with caps lock eliminated. This can be done using xmodmap with the command:

xmodmap -e "remove Lock = Caps_Lock" -e "remove Control = Control_L" -e
"keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L"-e "add Lock = Caps_Lock" -e "add Control =
Control_L"

or (more legibly) you can script this in a file:

  remove Lock = Caps_Lock
  remove Control = Control_L
  keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
  add Lock = Caps_Lock
  add Control = Control_L

Xmodmap can also be used for mapping "Meta" to "Alt", if you're an emacs user:

xmodmap -e "keysym Alt_L = Meta_L Alt_L"

While xmodmap is good for experimenting, the bindings don't work
outside of X, so ultimately you'll want to create a customized kmap file,
these are stored in /usr/share/keymaps under linux, and are run using 'loadkeys'.

Hope this helps,

Tyler

You can remap the key to be whatever you want.  I personally remap it
to tab, which makes command completion easier.  I have found that I
just never need caps lock.  If the little words printed on the
keyboard bother you, cover them with a little piece of tape or
something... but you really shouldn't be looking at your hands
anyway. ;-)

See xkeycaps, for example.  There is a non-X11 equivalent too, but I
don't remember it, off hand.

  Thanks, Tyler. I've used xmodmap to augment the keyboard programming.

  I've used the keyboard's programming, xmodmaps and loadkeys. And most of
the markings on the keys are pretty well worn off by now. I guess that 5-6
years of use is long for a keyboard.
 
  The Happy Hacking 2 keyboard is attactive, but it's still rather pricey.

Thanks,

Rich

FREE GEEK has several hundred used and tested keyboards available for 
about a dollar and a little time digging through the keyboard boxes. 
There's got to be something there that works the way you want it.

Not open until noon on Tuesday due to the holiday, though.

For a while now I've used more instead of less because 'less' clears my
terminal screen upon quitting. I just discovered this can be prevented
using 'less -X': another convenience is having less quit at the end of a
file like more: 'less -E'.

If you use 'less' as your output processor for the man pages, the options
can be specified using:

alias man='man --pager="less -XE"'

However, this doesn't seem to work on solaris systems, so you might have
to test the version. This can be done using a 'gnutest' function, ie:

gnutest() {
        $1 --version 2> /dev/null
}
if [ "$(gnutest man)" ]; then
        alias man='man --pager="less -XE"'
fi

less also can be tested for what options it supports:

if [ $(less --version | grep "^less [0-9]" | tr -d "less ") -ge 374 ];
then
        alias less="less -XE -options --status-column --hilite-search "
else
        alias less="less -XE "
fi
alias more='less'
alias m='more'


Anyway, I just had to share that after putting up with 'more' for so long... ;)

   Thanks, Richard. I won't be in town Monday or Tuesday, but I'll keep this
in mind.

  I have an old, 84-key board that I use with the floppyfw when I need to
reboot it. I can always use that, I suppose, as long as the plugs match. :-)

 Set the modem settings to go to the /dev/ttyS# where the /dev is determined
by the i/o port. If the modem is connected to serial port # 1 then
it is /dev/ttyS0 serial port #2 /dev/ttyS1 Serial port #3 /dev/ttyS2
Serial port #4 /dev/ttyS3

Okay, after a week of combing the town, I cannot find a place to go to
around town that has non-wireless access.

So, I am thinking I just bite the bullet and get a pcmcia card for my

My first question is what do people recommend?

My second is have your experiences been good?  Is it easy enough to use
linux to connect anywhere around I can find a wifi bubble?

OK, I have Woody up and running, and now I'd like to get a printer working.  
I thought I'd give a USB printer a chance. 

I've done the following to isolate the problem:
#cat tempfile > /dev/usb/lp0
gives: No such device

I've given the command:
#modprobe usb-ohci
and checked with
#lsmod
to find that both
 usb-ohci
 usbcore
are loaded.

I don't know what to try next.

Sounds like a good idea to me. Check out http://www.personaltelco.net
for great information regarding wireless networking. And you might even
be interested in setting up a NoCat  box (firewall and authentication
trap(open mode for public access)) and becoming a Public Node.

Something with the Prism2 chipset will provide you with the most
options. Again you can get some good references at the site above. Most
all cards will work under Linux. Those with the prism2 chipset will a
low you to put your card and Linux machine into AP mode. However if you
only plan on having you machine in client mode this doesn't matter as
much and the Cisco and Orinoco cards will work fine.

Yes. Very Very good.

Again, Yes. There is yet to be a nice software front end for changing
your wireless settings but it's very contained and easy to learn which
files will be modified to set you wi-fi settings and tools like
iwconfig.

I just ran across that.  Don't know how I missed it before.

Sounds like RH7.2 is kind of a pain with the wireless pcmcia card,
though.  Has anybody had any experience with this, and is RH7.3 any
better?

There's only one X server in Xfree86 > 4.

You just want to make sure that you have a Device section in your
XF86Config that reads:
Driver	"s3"

If this is a fresh install, then you're either not running XFree 4 or
you've got some mixed packages or bad config files.

> Being a newbie I am kind of lost.

Totally understandable, though.  The changes between XFree 3 and 4 were
pretty confusing.

Message-ID: <3D273EF2.E34AEF55@attbi.com>

Mom likes to print all her e-mail and read it from paper instead of the
screen. Because of this, she goes through a lot of ink (using a Canon
BJ-100, I think). She doesn't need really high quality output; just good
enough to read. It occurred to me that ribbons seemed to last a lot
longer than ink cartridges, so I'm thinking about finding a small
footprint unit (like the old Pro-Printer). 

Does anyone have recent experience with ribbon printers? Are there any
common ones for which ribbons are more easily obtained? Does anyone have
any other printer recommendations, with the primary consideration being
cheap operation?

Nothing's cheaper to operate than a laser. I've got mixed feelings about the 
botom end HP, but they seem to work fine for some people. There are lots of 
used older lasers out there, too. The Laseret II and III were pretty useable, 
too.

Install the XF86_SVGA package from the 3rd RedHat CD-ROM.
rpm -i XFree86-SVGA-3.3.6-44.i386.rpm

It's been a few months since I setup my USB printer (also under woody),
but one question comes to mind, is the USB printer driver (coincidentally
named "printer" :-) installed?

Interesting. I've always thought of the replacement toner cartridges
being pretty expensive, and then there's the drum, when it goes. That's
why I was thinking about ribbon printers. I had Epson 9-pin printers for
years and never wore one out. The only replacement item was the ribbon,
and ribbons are relatively cheap.

I've used an HP 6p before. It was pretty reliable, but replacment toner
cartridges weren't cheap.

Part of the problem is that Mom prints at 16 pt, bold, to make it easier
to read. That tends to use up ink faster than 12 pt regular.

Thanks for the idea. I'll do some more research into lasers.

I installed using the web admin.  Shouldn't /dev/usb/lp0 be a device anyway?
Is 'printer' an alias for a module?
How do I check to see if it's installed?

"printer" is a module, so lsmod should tell you if it is installed.
/dev/usb/lp0 is a device file which (like all the devices under the /dev
directory) is simply an interface point between the device driver and the
file system to allow general access to the device as though it were a
file.  The fact that the device exists in the file system, does not mean
that the underlying driver which it provides access to is installed.

I've had my HP LaserJet IIIp for, oh, a decade now and have never, 
ever had any trouble with it. Toner's widely available and relatively 
inexpensive. Just make sure you bump up the printer's memory to its 
max (2 MB).

Don't laser printers gobble electrons?  I'd vote for a 9-pin epson where the 
extra noise isn't a big problem.  It's been a while--you might want to check 
ribbon availability.

Sounds like I've been practicing false economy. I'd better check further
into lasers.

I also had good experiences with Okidata printers. The 320 Turbo is
still in production, but I don't want to spend around $300!

I checked on the Office Depot web site and found tons of ribbon printers
supported.

By rest of the system, I assume you mean application software?  UNIX/Linux
systems generally take the approach of making everything look like a file,
so for application code, it simply uses a standard "open" subroutine call
to open the device just like any other file (the kernel uses the major
device ID to map the "open" to the correct driver), and the data is
read/written the same as it would be for any other file.  For handling
specialized I/O needs which are device specific (or in some cases
specialized extended file operations for regular files), there is a
standard function "ioctl" which is called to perform these operations on
the device/file, though since the needs of each device are generally
different, there is only limited standardization of the functionality of
commands issued using ioctl.  There have been various attempts over the
years to pull out standard functionality from ioctl in order to make
software more generic and portable, but it has had only limited success.

> Are the major,minor nos. in the driver code?

Yes, sort of.  For most standard devices, there is a predefined major
device number which is hard coded (usually as a #define in a header file)
into the device driver, and the mapping to the device driver comes not
from the file name of the device file, but from it's major and minor
device numbers.  The minor device number is just passed to the device
driver that corresponds to the major devices number, and is typically used
to denote which device, since the same driver may be used for a number of
different devices in a particular class (such as serial ports).  While
this is typical use for the minor number, it's use is actually undefined
and it can be used for any purpose.

Just for the sake of muddying the waters :-) non-standard/custom devices
can dynamically allocate their major device numbers at run time, and the
devfs file system introduced with the 2.4 kernels I believe intends to
make all major device numbers as well as the device files themselves,
dynamically created (and destroyed) at run time.  I have only glanced over
this stuff so I don't really know any details, since no one has hired me
to do a Linux device driver so far, and I haven't had any reasons to
modify or create any Linux device drivers on my own for several years.

[snip]

Without taking the time to look at this specific case (i.e. I may be
wrong on some technicality, but overall this should be correct :-)
printer is probably dependent on usb-ohci, the printer driver is
specifically a USB printer driver, so it needs a USB interface to
provide it's communication link to the printer in order to do anything,
and this functionality would be provided by the usb-ohci driver.  Of
course this doesn't work both ways, there is no reason for the usb-ohci
module to depend on the printer module, since it doesn't really care what
devices are out on the bus, it simply provides the communication channel
to them.  A quick look at my own system does show that usb-ohci is
dependent on usbcore however, which is a common set of USB related
subroutines that most USB drivers would likely need.

I've had great luck with Citizen printers.  The ribbons last a long time
and are usually $8 or less.

[snip]

One place that most people don't think to check when figuring the true
cost per page, is the rated life of the printer itself (expressed in
number of pages printed -- usually in the fine print).  Most (but not all)
inkjet printers have a pagelife rating of between 3,000 and 10,000 pages,
5,000 seemed to be typical when I was looking, which would increase the
cost per page by $0.02 for a $100 printer.  My experience with pin
printers (when I used them) was that they didn't do much better than the
5,000 to 10,000 page range before developing print head problems, and once
the printer was out of warranty, it cost as much to get a new print head
installed as it did to buy a new printer.  I also did some looking at
laser printers recently and was surprized to find at least one that had a
page life rating in the under 10,000 range (unfortunately I don't remember
the brand, though it was about the cheapest laser I found).

As far as lasers gobbling power, any good one will do a much better job
these days than they used to, going into a low power standby state after
it has been idle for a few minutes, and generally the peak power the draw
when first starting up is much lower as well, but this is something to
consider as well since it varies alot from printer to printer.

I would highly recommend spending some time at: www.linuxprinting.org
since this will tell you how well supported various printers are under
linux, as well as giving recommendations for various types of printers.
There are also some sites out there that give the cost per page for
printing on a variety of printers (though I don't think most of them take
into account the cost of the printer and rated life).

FWIW, I went with the Epson Stylus C80 inkjet, it cost about $150, has one
of the lowest costs per page for inkjet printers, is one of the fastest
inkjets, the ink is waterproof, at the time I bought it was listed as the
best supported color inkjet under Linux, and has a 70,000 page rated life!
Of course there are some down sides (according to the reviews -- I have
no complaints so far): it's printing isn't as sharp as many other ink
jets, the print head is not part of the cartridges so if there is a
problem with the head, it means sending it in for service rather than
simply replacing the cartridges, and the ink does have a rather limited
shelf life as well as life in the printer, so if it isn't used within a
certain time frame (something like six months to a year), you may have to
throw it out.  There were some complaints on line about failures and poor
service, but they didn't seem excessive to me, and these days I think if
you don't find complaints about a product on line, it probably means it
isn't shipping yet. :-)

Well, cost per page and the gross printer cost depends on how much you print,
how much catriges cost and if you perform periodic maintenance on your 
printer or not.

It is true if you just print and print without care for your printer. 
If once a year you flush inkjet printer printhead with an alcohol and 
slightly lubricate two guide rails it'll serve you up to six times of what 
you've described here.  
I have 10 year old  Cannon BJC 620 bubble jet printer. 
Which prints every day from 50 to 100 color pages of adds and flyers. 
Though, I don't spend any money on ink catriges (I brew color and black inks 
by myself), the cost per page is almost 0;

Again, it's true if you don't do periodic maintenance to your matrix pin 
printer.
I use Epson LQ 570+ printer every day during last five years to print
invoices, manuals and other non color documents.
Once a month I clean and lubricate it's guide rails and gear set.
Once a year I soak the working part of print head in alcohol to get rid of 
gunk and chunks of ribbon. Tiny drop of synthetic light oil is enough to 
lubricate matrix pin channels and keep them from wearing out.
Recently I stopped to buy new ribbon catriges. 
I found the way how to recharge an old ribbon with custom brewed ink.
The cost per page is almost 0;

If you're not a hopless slob manufacturing warranty has no meaning to you.

Exactly the same rules of periodic cleaning and gear lubrication apply to 
laser jet printers. 
I have Brother HL1240  laser jet printer for customer documentation and 
manuals. It prints on average 100 pages a day during last two years.
The only one thing I'm spending  money on is a bottle of black toner and the 
drum. 
Everybody can recharge an empty toner catrige by yourself without paying 
extra money. 
As soon as I find the way how to make custom toner I'll cost me almost 
nothing to print.
I found the way how to polish worn out laser drum in place to extend its life 
span to three times what original had.

There are so many ways to save money doing very simple things.
Though, you have to change you attitude from the "throw away culture" towards 
to "safe and reuse culture".

FWIW,

I've had my HP 4P for nearly 8 years now and have not had any problems 
with it except having to buy a toner cartridge now and then. My wife 
loves to print gobs of stuff and I think I would be spending a lot more 
money if she was using our Lexmark Optra Color 40 inkjet printer all of 
the time as the cartridges aren't cheap. I know I have already spent 
several times the $99.00 the printer cost me at buy.com in inkjet 
cartriges and that figure will continue to rise.

I save a few bucks by buying a two pack of Lexmark cartridges at Costco 
for around $52.00. The cost of one laser toner cartridge is about 
$70.00 and my wife goes through reams of paper before the toner 
cartridge is empty. I'm not sure I can even print 500 pages before an 
inkjet cartridge needs replacing in our inkjet printer.

Yeah, my old LJ IIp doesn't have a low-power mode like the newer 
lasers do -- but I can usually batch up my print jobs so that usually 
I just power up the printer, print my jobs, and turn the printer back 
off again. Granted, it's not a procedure that'll work for everyone.

The problem with dot-matrix printers is that they can't be used to
print the pictures that often accompany e-mail these days :-)  
Otherwise, other than the noise and their inherent slowness, they're
fine.

In fact, my first did-it-just-for-me computer program was some
downloadable fonts for my Seikosha 24-pin. This was back in 1987, when
softfonts were both rare and expensive. I was tired of hand-writing
Greek and Hebrew stuff into my term papers, so I wrote fonts I could
ship to the printer and access from within WordPerfect 4.x for DOS. My
wife's family thought I was crazy, spending my Christmas break
blocking out Greek and Hebrew letters on graph paper so I could figure
out the byte-maps the Seikosha could understand :-)

I think I have boasted about the rock-solid nature of my HP IIp+ at
least once here. I'll have owned it for 10 years this December, it's
burned thru about about 8 to 10 toner cartridges in it's life (two a
year for the first few years, gradually down to one lasting two years)
& is currently on it's second computer. (The self-test I just ran
reports it has printed 38,931 pages.) And I second Paul's advice
about adding as much memory as possible for one of these.

And it's worth the cost of fixing it. (Which has been only twice; the
first time after it had been running on a broken part for about 3 years.)
I only wish printers were built to last like this one was.

I found two of these (similiar era) on the street a few years back. 
Form-factor of a large microwave oven with a twenty-pound turkey indside.
Power cable was as thick as my thumb (hyperbolie ok, prollay 14 ga. which is 
good for 15 amps, IIRC.)  Didn't have the $ to fix them so they got donated 
to some repair shop in town.

Agreed, when the original poster mentioned printing email, I assumed text only.

That sounds very cool.  In '87 24-pin heads were very elite.  I do remember 
similiar low-level access to my first printer (Epson RX-80).  While I don't 
have an Epson on hand now, I have given a few away.  Keep the dot-matrixs 
around for the same reason as an external 14.4 modem: troubleshooting.  When 
a page prints or the lights flash, you know something.

The two old dot-matrix printers I have are somehow comforting.  Just plugged 
one into my dog and it works.

I'd love to hear more about Alex's ink recipe...

Our old Dot Matrix printer was able to print graphics... they were all in grayscale, of course, and very low quality... but they printed.

I should note this was back in the HyperDOS/DOS 5.x days.  It was a seperate app (seperate from WP 5.1, IIRC) that printed 'printart'.  :-)

Here is the recipe for Cannon BJC 620 color inks.
Original color inks bases on the metil alcohol mixed 
with black, cyan, magenta and yellow pigments.
You can substitute metil alcohol with etil alcohol or 
97% concentartion rubbing alcohol sold in department stores.
Except this you have to get a couple of roller ball pen cores with the paste 
of black cyan, magenta and yellow colors. Each core will produce 
approximately up to 60 standard ink catriges.
The initial proportion per ink catrige is 3% of pigment on 97% of alcohol.
Pour this mix into a flask with a tight cap and shake it well within 5-10 
minutes or until you see that the pigment was completely dissolved in 
alcohol. 
After this you have to give it a warm water bath at  30-40 C (degree of 
Celsius)  within 15 minutes.
You can use a small cattle filled with water to heat your flasks with inks.
After you done this, let it cool to the room temperature.
Final product should look like colored transparent liquid with the color of 
the same consistency and strength as an original ink. 
You can add some more core paste if you need to get a darker ink color. 
Using plastic syringe with the needle recharge your empty catrige with 
appropriate color and enjoy printing for free.

Recipe for ribbon catrige:
Original ribbon catrige has oil based ink with a black pigment.
As a black pigment you can use typograph black paint which has 
consistency of a paste or light grease.
For oil you can use almost any heavy natural oil which has a tendency to 
slowly dry out or polymerize. 
I use for this purposes cotton seed oil which has a great polymerization 
ability. 
Mix about 5-7% of black typograph paint with 95-93% of oil.
Pour it into flask and shake it within 15-20 minutes.
Give it a hot water bath at 60-70% C within 30-45 minutes.
Let it cool to the room temperature. 
You should get a radical black oil based liquid ink. 
Test it on a scrap paper if you need to add some more typographic ink in it.
Completely pull out used ribbon from the catrige and put it into a plastic 
bag without holes. 
Pour two tea spoons of your custom ink into this bag with used ribbon and 
close it tight with a rubber ring or a rope. Shake it and jam with you hands 
within 20 -25 minutes so your custom ink will saturate into ribbon fibers.
Put ribbon back into the catrige and enjoy printing for free. 
One ribbon could sustain up to 10-15 recharges till it wears completely. 
  
That's it

Alex

If you can find a good toner re-charge service you can get your cartridges 
much cheaper and when they need rebuilding you get a good drum.  I happen 
to know the local toner re-charge company and have watched as they rebuilt 
a cartridge.  I've had pretty long discussions with the owner who talked 
me out of a Lexmark (which I've had nothing but good experiences with) 
into an HP 1200 which I love about how printers are built and maintained.  
I also know the local computer shop folks that repairs printers.

Is this a roll over.  Typically duty cycle it 40K a year but probably a 
little lower for the II series.  I'm at 4,000 on my lightly used HP 1200 
after 6 months.

The old HPs are like that.  As I mentioned above I know the printer repair 
folks.  They deal with a company that does a pretty large amount of 
re-furbished printers with the old HPs being a pretty fair mover given the 
shipping costs are killer.
   The issue of "why they don't build them like the used to" is mass 
market economics.  Rumor has it HP did a study a few years ago and notice 
users were buy new printers about every three years.  So they decided to 
build their printers to last about 3 years.  They are also less 
re-repairable.  Parts are not available or after labor it costs almost 
as much as a new printer on the low cost end.  You will also notice that 
the toner cartridge changes with almost every model.  This is to make it 
difficult for the 'other' recharging and recharging component companies.  
I seem to remember that HP doesn't even recharge the cartridges you send 
back to them.  They recycle them - disassembled and into the bins.

On another note when Tektronics (now owned by Xerox) was doing their 
freecolorprinter.com offer the company I worked for did a cost per page 
analysis between the crayon/color stick printer and ink jet systems.  
Pretty rough one since it was obvious right off there was a considerable 
difference.  Typically $0.30+/page ink jet and < $0.10/page crayon even 
buying them from Tektronics.  Quality-wise there was no comparison - the 
crayon won hands down.  Speed was pretty much in the crayon favor also.

Well enough rambling.


Cheers,
Rod

I don't know about the other distros... but in the default Slackware kernel there is support for a.out and MISC binaries via modules.  ELF support is compiled right in.  :-)

I would imagine your distro also has support for a.out and MISC binaries.  If not, you can probably make your own kernel (although from what I've heard, that can be complicated in RedHat, Mandrake, or other RPM-based distros).

This is a bit offtopic, but does anyone know where I can find either:

1) Parts and service manuals for an HP Laserjet III?  I get the nasty

2) Someplace that will service it inexpensively

ELF is not a Linux-specific thing. It was first used on Solaris. I think
FreeBSD uses it now as well, and possibly other Unices.

Here's my recipe for building roll-your-own kernels on a Red Hat 
system:

1. Boot into the default Red Hat kernel, do an 'lsmod' and take note 
   of every single module that's currently running. Red Hat's kernels 
   have very few things compiled in statically (ext2, binary formats 
   like ELF and a.out, and other really essential stuff), so
   a list of running modules will tell you most of the capabilites 
   you're going to need in your kernel.

   If you can't figure out what a certain module does, try opening
   /path/to/linux/src/Documentation/Configure.help in the pager of 
   your choice and searching for the module name. Chances are that 
   you'll be able to discover the configuration option for the module 
   in question.

2. Do 'make xconfig' or, my favorite, 'make menuconfig,' taking care 
   to match (at least) the capabilities of the RH kernel. This isn't a
   100% fool-proof method to define the kernel you'll need, but it's a 
   good start.

3. make bzImage && make modules && make modules_install;
   cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-<version>
   cp System.map /boot/System.map-<version>
   cp .config /boot/config-<version>

4. Edit lilo or grub config file or, if you're adventurous, check out 
   the /sbin/new-kernel-pkg script that accompanies Red Hat 7.x; it'll 
   do grub.conf updates and build an initrd image for you.

Cross fingers; offer supplications to appropriate deity; reboot.

Message-ID: <1026078465.25465.137.camel@lana.manymoons.net>

It has become apparent that I would be a lot better off if I were to
upgrade to RH 7.3.  It seems as if every one of my latest issues, from
wireless connectivity to video drivers, would be taken care of by this
release.  The problem is that I don't have the money to buy it (still
under-employeed these days), and I am nervous about upgrading over the
web (I am worried that my flakey DSL connection will quit in the middle
and I will be screwed).  On top of all that, my CD Burner recently went
tits up and so the ISOs would do me no good.

Therefore, I was wondering if anybody would mind loaning me the disks
for the install.  This would be greatly appreciated.

What about make dep and maybe make clean?

In slackware, just boot up, get some clean source (it's not always the best idea to use the stuff in /usr/src/linux ... best to leave that as-is) ... do a make mrproper to be sure it is clean, copy /boot/config to .config (gives you some nice defaults)... then adjust the config accordingly and follow your steps, with an added make dep && make clean after the configuration.

Do you compile as a root?  I always do everything except the installations (of the kernel, modules, System.map, and re-running lilo) as a regular user.  I thought I read somewhere that was how to do it... I dunno, though.  :-)

My Redhat-using friend had problems with RPM stuff when he rolled his own kernels.  Something totally kept him from using the ntfs module at all.  He was dual booting with Win2K on that particular box.

In order to satisfy the requirements of various non-kernel packages on
a Red Hat system, you have to either keep an official kernel package
installed (even if you don't use it) or roll your own kernel rpm.

Of course, that doesn't explain why your friend couldn't use the ntfs
module. I'd have to see the particulars of his case even to begin
troubleshooting a problem like that.

For a while, Red Hat kernels were getting really good. The 2.2.19 and
2.4.9 series were excellent. I'd always built my own kernels until
those releases, but I started using the stock kernels because they
performed so well for me.

Something boofed, however, in 2.4.18 (the kernel shipped with RH 7.3);  
its nfs and nfsd are really screwy -- so I've gone back to building my 
own using the standard tarballs from kernel.org.

I have a epson 600 color inkjet that needs a good home.  I don't use it 
enough to keep it working.  It needs to be hooked up to a windows machine and 
have the head cleaned about 20 times to clean out the head.  Then it works 
fine.  If it's used regularly it will work fine, works great under linux,

I would prefer to give it to some of the PLUG underemployed, or undergraduate

Okay, let's work together to create the perfect spam filter. Please look
at my .forward file and my .procmailrc and critique them. Tell me what is

it correctly? Are there more IP addresses and domains you think should be
filtered? Etc. I will continue to work on this until spam is reduced a lot
while at the same time legit email does not seem to be being caught. When
I have achieved that I will post the final for all to use who want it.
Note: part of the following is based on something Rich posted here some

My only question is, why? spamassassin catches 99+% of the spam I get, and I've only seen it catch a couple of mailing lists as spam. It's easy to fix that.

My ISP offers spamassassin which I used and it did very little to reduce
spam. What I am trying to do is filter spam before it even reaches me. If
I were to setup spamassasin it would be local which I suppose is fine but
I wanted to set something up in my shell at Pacifier which would filter
out the spam before I even download my mail.

It looks like you're pretty procmail-savvy.  Spamassassin just marks
things-- it's up to procmail to delete or re-file the messages that are
(likely) spam:

Here's a suggested .procmailrc:
----- CUT HERE -----
:0fw
| spamassassin -P
:0e
{
        EXITCODE=$?
}

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
/dev/null
----- CUT HERE -----

You can also tailor your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs as needed.  I
aggressively check, so I dropped the required_hits to 4 from 5.

I also have the RAZOR_CHECK add 5 to the spam score, ensuring that all
Razor-tagged messages get filtered.  You can tweak all kinds of things
in your user_prefs file to make Spamassassin cut out the spam.

http://spamassassin.org/tests.html

It works better than a massive .procmailrc file.  Really.

Dump all the .* you are wasting time and space. 
procmail sees:

Subject: [PLUG] kde and xinerama question
Message-ID: <20020708192006.D22F910E055@pons.enet.sharplabs.com>

I'm at my wits end regarding kde and xinerama.

I've got the two heads running just fine.
I've got the virtual desktop running under a single
KDE invocation (KDE-2.2.2) so I can slide a window
across screens.

But there is some very annoying behaviour that I can't seem
to rid myself of.

In particular, if I horizontally maximise, say, an emacs window it
maximises across the _entire_ virtual desktop, which, in most cases,
is the wrong thing to do.

When the kde screensaver comes up, it is centered in the virtual
desktop not in one of the physical desktops---again the wrong
thing to do.

I've wasted a lot of time poking around in google and all I've
discovered that KDE 2.2.2 is supposed to be "xinerama-aware" but, from
the above behaviour, it clearly isn't.

What do I need to do to get kde to understand that I'm running
xinerama?  I'm running Mandrake 8.2 with stock KDE.

Subject: [PLUG] Debian Install
Message-ID: <3D2A1831.4DF58600@attbi.com>

I'm finally getting ready to start installing Debian on my Thinkpad.
I've been reading:

http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/ch-preparing.en.html

Section 3.2 "Information You Will Need," tells me:

  Besides this document, you'll need the _cfdisk_ manual page, the
_fdisk_
  manual page, the _dselect Tutorial_, and the _Linux Hardware
  Compatibility HOWTO_

The dselect Tutorial page is there, as is the Linux Hardware
Compatiblility HOWTO, but when I try to look at either the cfdisk or the
fdisk man pages I get the following:

  ** man page not found ** . 

Are these the same ones I get when I look at man pages on my Red Hat
system? Are there any subtle differences between the ones the Debian
site wants me to read and the Red Hat versions?

Don't know, but attached is the output of "man cfdisk" on my debian

CFDISK(8)           Linux Programmer's Manual           CFDISK(8)



NNAAMMEE
       cfdisk - Curses based disk partition table manipulator for
       Linux

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       ccffddiisskk [[ --aaggvvzz ]] [[ --cc _c_y_l_i_n_d_e_r_s ]] [[ --hh _h_e_a_d_s ]] [[  --ss  _s_e_c_?
       _t_o_r_s_-_p_e_r_-_t_r_a_c_k ]] [[ --PP _o_p_t ]] [[ _d_e_v_i_c_e ]]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ccffddiisskk is a curses based program for partitioning any hard
       disk drive.  Typical values of the _d_e_v_i_c_e argument are:

              /dev/hda [default]
              /dev/hdb
              /dev/sda
              /dev/sdb
              /dev/sdc
              /dev/sdd

       In order to write the partition table ccffddiisskk  needs  some?
       thing  called  the  `geometry'  of the disk: the number of
       `heads' and the number of `sectors per track'. Linux  does
       not  use any geometry, so if the disk will not be accessed
       by other operating systems,  you  can  safely  accept  the
       defaults that ccffddiisskk chooses for you. The geometry used by
       ccffddiisskk is found as follows. First the partition  table  is
       examined,  to  see  what geometry was used by the previous
       program that changed it. If the partition table is  empty,
       or  contains  garbage,  or  does not point at a consistent
       geometry, the kernel is asked for advice. If nothing works
       255  heads  and  63 sectors/track is assumed. The geometry
       can be overridden on the command line or by use of the `g'
       command.  When  partitioning  an  empty large modern disk,
       picking 255 heads and 63 sectors/track is  always  a  good
       idea.   There  is  no need to set the number of cylinders,
       since ccffddiisskk knows the disk size.

       Next, ccffddiisskk tries to read  the  current  partition  table
       from  the  disk  drive.  If it is unable to figure out the
       partition table, an error is  displayed  and  the  program
       will  exit.  This might also be caused by incorrect geome?
       try information, and can  be  overridden  on  the  command
       line.   Another  way  around  this  problem is with the --zz
       option.  This will ignore the partition table on the disk.

       The main display is composed of four sections, from top to
       bottom: the header, the partitions, the command line and a
       warning  line.   The  header contains the program name and
       version number followed by the disk drive and  its  geome?
       try.   The  partitions section always displays the current
       partition table.  The command line is the place where com?
       mands  and  text  are entered.  The available commands are
       usually displayed in brackets.  The warning line  is  usu?
       ally  empty  except when there is important information to
       be displayed.  The current partition is  highlighted  with
       reverse  video  (or  an  arrow if the --aa option is given).
       All partition specific commands apply to the current  par?
       tition.

       The  format  of the partition table in the partitions sec?
       tion is, from left to right: Name, Flags, Partition  Type,
       Filesystem  Type  and  Size.   The  name  is the partition
       device name.  The flags can be _B_o_o_t,  which  designates  a
       bootable partition or _N_C, which stands for "Not Compatible
       with DOS or OS/2".  DOS, OS/2 and possibly other operating
       systems require the first sector of the first partition on
       the disk and all logical partitions to begin on the second
       head.   This  wastes the second through the last sector of
       the first track of the first head  (the  first  sector  is
       taken  by  the partition table itself).  ccffddiisskk allows you
       to recover these "lost" sectors with the maximize  command
       (mm).  _N_o_t_e_: ffddiisskk(8) and some early versions of DOS create
       all partitions with the number of  sectors  already  maxi?
       mized.   For  more  information,  see the maximize command
       below.  The partition type can be one of _P_r_i_m_a_r_y or  _L_o_g_i_?
       _c_a_l.   For  unallocated  space on the drive, the partition
       type can also be _P_r_i_/_L_o_g, or empty (if the space is  unus?
       able).   The  filesystem type section displays the name of
       the filesystem used on the partition, if known.  If it  is
       unknown,  then _U_n_k_n_o_w_n and the hex value of the filesystem
       type are displayed.  A special case occurs when there  are
       sections  of  the  disk drive that cannot be used (because
       all of the primary partitions are  used).   When  this  is
       detected,  the  filesystem  type is displayed as _U_n_u_s_a_b_l_e.
       The size field displays  the  size  of  the  partition  in
       megabytes  (by  default).  It can also display the size in
       sectors  and  cylinders  (see  the  change  units  command
       below).   If an asterisks (**) appears after the size, this
       means that the partition is not aligned on cylinder bound?
       aries.

DDOOSS 66..xx WWAARRNNIINNGG
       The  DOS  6.x FORMAT command looks for some information in
       the first sector of the data area of  the  partition,  and
       treats this information as more reliable than the informa?
       tion in the partition table.  DOS FORMAT expects DOS FDISK
       to  clear the first 512 bytes of the data area of a parti?
       tion whenever a size change occurs.  DOS FORMAT will  look
       at  this extra information even if the /U flag is given --
       we consider this a bug in DOS FORMAT and DOS FDISK.

       The bottom line is that if you  use  cfdisk  or  fdisk  to
       change  the  size of a DOS partition table entry, then you
       must also use dddd to zero the first 512 bytes of that  par?
       tition  before  using  DOS FORMAT to format the partition.
       For example, if you were using cfdisk to make a DOS parti?
       tion  table entry for /dev/hda1, then (after exiting fdisk
       or cfdisk and rebooting Linux so that the partition  table
       information  is  valid)  you  would  use  the  command "dd
       if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda1  bs=512  count=1"  to  zero  the
       first 512 bytes of the partition. Note:

       BBEE  EEXXTTRREEMMEELLYY  CCAARREEFFUULL  if you use the dddd command, since a
       small typo can make all of the data on your disk  useless.

       For  best  results,  you  should always use an OS-specific
       partition table program.  For example, you should make DOS
       partitions with the DOS FDISK program and Linux partitions
       with the Linux fdisk or Linux cfdisk program.


CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
       ccffddiisskk commands can be entered by pressing the desired key
       (pressing _E_n_t_e_r after the command is not necessary).  Here
       is a list of the available commands:

       bb      Toggle bootable  flag  of  the  current  partition.
              This  allows  you to select which primary partition
              is bootable on the drive.

       dd      Delete the current partition.   This  will  convert
              the  current partition into free space and merge it
              with any free  space  immediately  surrounding  the
              current  partition.   A partition already marked as
              free space or marked as unusable cannot be deleted.

       gg      Change the disk geometry (cylinders, heads, or sec?
              tors-per-track).  WWAARRNNIINNGG:: This option should  only
              be  used by people who know what they are doing.  A
              command line option is also available to change the
              disk  geometry.   While at the change disk geometry
              command line, you can choose  to  change  cylinders
              (cc),  heads  (hh),  and  sectors per track (ss).  The
              default value will be printed at the  prompt  which
              you can accept by simply pressing the _E_n_t_e_r key, or
              you can exit without changes by  pressing  the  _E_S_C
              key.  If you want to change the default value, sim?
              ply enter the desired value and press  _E_n_t_e_r.   The
              altered  disk  parameter  values do not take effect
              until you return the main menu (by  pressing  _E_n_t_e_r
              or  _E_S_C  at  the change disk geometry command line.
              If you change  the  geometry  such  that  the  disk
              appears  larger, the extra sectors are added at the
              end of the disk as free space.  If the disk appears
              smaller,  the  partitions  that  are beyond the new
              last sector are deleted and the last  partition  on
              the  drive  (or  the  free  space at the end of the
              drive) is made to end at the new last sector.

       hh      Print the help screen.

       mm      Maximize disk usage of the current partition.  This
              command  will  recover the the unused space between
              the partition table and the beginning of the parti?
              tion,  but  at  the  cost  of  making the partition
              incompatible with  DOS,  OS/2  and  possibly  other
              operating systems.  This option will toggle between
              maximal disk usage and DOS, OS/2,  etc.  compatible
              disk  usage.  The default when creating a partition
              is to create DOS, OS/2, etc. compatible partitions.

       nn      Create  new partition from free space.  If the par?
              tition type is _P_r_i_m_a_r_y or _L_o_g_i_c_a_l, a  partition  of
              that  type  will  be  created, but if the partition
              type is _P_r_i_/_L_o_g, you will be prompted for the  type
              you  want  to  create.  Be aware that (1) there are
              only four slots available  for  primary  partitions
              and (2) since there can be only one extended parti?
              tion, which contains all of the logical drives, all
              of  the  logical drives must be contiguous (with no
              intervening  primary   partition).    ccffddiisskk   next
              prompts  you for the size of the partition you want
              to create.  The default size, equal to  the  entire
              free  space of the current partition, is display in
              megabytes.  You can either press the _E_n_t_e_r  key  to
              accept  the  default size or enter a different size
              at the prompt.   ccffddiisskk  accepts  size  entries  in
              megabytes  (MM)  [default], kilobytes (KK), cylinders
              (CC) and sectors (SS) by entering the number  immedi?
              ately  followed  by  one of (MM, KK, CC or SS).  If the
              partition fills the free space available, the  par?
              tition  is created and you are returned to the main
              command line.  Otherwise, the partition can be cre?
              ated at the beginning or the end of the free space,
              and ccffddiisskk will ask you to choose  where  to  place
              the  partition.   After  the  partition is created,
              ccffddiisskk automatically adjusts the other  partition's
              partition  types  if  all of the primary partitions
              are used.

       pp      Print the partition table to the  screen  or  to  a
              file.  There  are several different formats for the
              partition that you can choose from:


              rr      Raw data format (exactly what would be writ?
                     ten to disk)

              ss      Partition table in sector order format

              tt      Partition table in raw format

              The  _r_a_w  _d_a_t_a  _f_o_r_m_a_t  will print the sectors that
              would be written to disk  if  a  wwrite  command  is
              selected.   First,  the  primary partition table is
              printed, followed by the partition  tables  associ?
              ated  with  each  logical  partition.   The data is
              printed in hex byte by byte with 16 bytes per line.

              The  _p_a_r_t_i_t_i_o_n  _t_a_b_l_e  _i_n  _s_e_c_t_o_r _o_r_d_e_r _f_o_r_m_a_t will
              print the partition table ordered by sector number.
              The  fields,  from left to right, are the number of
              the partition, the partition type, the  first  sec?
              tor,  the  last  sector,  the offset from the first
              sector of the partition to the start of  the  data,
              the  length  of  the partition, the filesystem type
              (with the hex value in parenthesis), and the  flags
              (with  the  hex value in parenthesis).  In addition
              to the primary and  logical  partitions,  free  and
              unusable  space  is printed and the extended parti?
              tion is printed before the first logical partition.

              If  a partition does not start or end on a cylinder
              boundary or if the partition length is not  divisi?
              ble  by  the  cylinder  size,  an  asterisks (**) is
              printed after the non-aligned sector  number/count.
              This usually indicates that a partition was created
              by an operating system that either does  not  align
              partitions to cylinder boundaries or that used dif?
              ferent disk geometry information.  If you know  the
              disk  geometry  of  the other operating system, you
              could  enter  the  geometry  information  with  the
              change geometry command (gg).

              For  the  first  partition  on the disk and for all
              logical partitions, if the offset from  the  begin?
              ning of the partition is not equal to the number of
              sectors per track (i.e., the data does not start on
              the first head), a number sign (##) is printed after
              the offset.  For the remaining partitions,  if  the
              offset  is  not zero, a number sign will be printed
              after the offset.  This corresponds to the _N_C  flag
              in the partitions section of the main display.

              The  _p_a_r_t_i_t_i_o_n  _t_a_b_l_e  _i_n _r_a_w _f_o_r_m_a_t will print the
              partition table ordered by  partition  number.   It
              will  leave  out  all free and unusable space.  The
              fields, from left to right, are the number  of  the
              partition,  the  flags (in hex), the starting head,
              sector and cylinder, the filesystem  ID  (in  hex),
              the  ending head, sector and cylinder, the starting
              sector in the partition and the number  of  sectors
              in  the  partition.   The information in this table
              can be directly translated to the _r_a_w _d_a_t_a  _f_o_r_m_a_t.

              The  partition  table  entries  only  have  10 bits
              available to  represent  the  starting  and  ending
              cylinders.   Thus, when the absolute starting (end?
              ing) sector number is on a  cylinder  greater  than
              1023,  the  maximal  values  for  starting (ending)
              head, sector and cylinder are printed.  This is the
              method  used  by  OS/2, and thus fixes the problems
              associated with OS/2's fdisk rewriting  the  parti?
              tion  table  when  it is not in this format.  Since
              Linux and OS/2 use absolute sector counts, the val?
              ues  in  the  starting  and ending head, sector and
              cylinder are not used.

              systems, change partition type allows you to  enter
              the hex value of the filesystem you desire.  A list
              of the know filesystem types is displayed.  You can
              type in the filesystem type at the prompt or accept

They should be the same manpages.  Don't worry about it too much if you
have a general idea how to do a disk partition.

Just remember to hit [Write] when you're done!

I don't use procmail, but I think what Keith's referring to is that when
you use a ":" procmail creates a lock file to enforce mutual exclusion on
the sink file. So like, if your syntax is:

> > > :0:

then /dev/null is unnecessarily being locked between writes.

Hope this helps (and is correct)

Well, it didn't work, then I started troubleshooting and it works.

I had nothing to do with it.

Ok, I've tracked down Apache::MP3 and have learned enough CPAN to get the 
tar.gz file and poke around.

Followed the advice on...(why, oh why is the #^$%@ Location bar blank in 
Mozilla??)
<http://search.cpan.org/doc/LDS/Apache-MP3-2.26/MP3.pm>


But they seem to be missing a step, or taking something forgranted.

Whereas, before the link named 'Music' would give me a dir listing and play 
a few seconds of a selected mp3, now Apache knows it should be a handler for 
this dir.  But falls flat with an Internal Server Error.

error.log says:

[error] Can't locate Apache/MP3.pm in @INC (@INC contains: 
/usr/lib/perl5/5.6.0/i386-linux /usr/lib/perl5/5.6.0 
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/i386-linux /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0 
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl . /etc/httpd/ /etc/httpd/lib/perl) at (eval 4) line 3.

[error] Undefined subroutine &Apache::MP3::handler called.


So, trying to help, I copy MP3.pm to /etc/httpd/lib/perl
No dice.  (yes, I restart server after each experiment).
MP3.pm is executable by everyone.

Thoughts?

Well, I DID do some of that... but that was for Clint's DNS problem.  I
can't imagine that did anything to Mike's Apache config.

I got the error you're describing the first time I hit the site.

Then I tried the following:

wget --server-response http://www.computer-arts.net/~mike/

And it gave me a 200 OK and the index file... so I went back to Netscape,
and sure enough it all worked fine.

And it's still working.

Where was MP3.pm before you moved it?

Remember that perl is looking for Apache/MP3.pm, not just MP3.pm.

Write a little cgi that just echoes @INC to your browser so you can see
whether Apache::MP3 is installed in the right place.

That's just a little tiny start.

Looks like it's probably be Apache sending the wrong redirect url to the
browser when it redirects /~mike to /~mike/.  Have you tried setting the
ServerName directive to "ServerName www.computer-arts.net" in httpd.conf
(or whatever file spec's the config for that site)

 You seem to be running pine from a shell account and you
may need to setup a cron file to have procmail run at the ISP
or maybe the ISP does it on a per account basis? Look at
your procmail log file and see what it says, put it verbose mode.
 
If you need to get mail from your ISP to your computer try
fetchmail. http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/fetchmail/

Didn't move it, but copied it from a place I'm sure perl didn't know existed.

Perl is not one of my strengths.

Neither is CGI.

But yeah, from the error message, Apache can't find MP3.pm.  After putting 
it in two places it said it was looking, I'm still at a loss...

Wait for it...creating /etc/httpd/Apache/MP3.pm solved it!  That's 
intuitative--not.  Looks like a pocket of Linux inner-circleism,  I'm cool 
again, thanks.

Of course, this POS latest Mozilla can't pass the info to xmms correctly, 
but that for another bottle of wine.

That's fine, but there are some basics you should know, just to get by on
your own.

Think of the @INC variable as being equivalent to $PATH in bash (or DOS
for that matter).  It's the list of include directories where perl looks
for modules.

> But yeah, from the error message, Apache can't find MP3.pm.  After

More importantly, perl couldn't find Apache::MP3 or, more directly related
to your problem, Apache/MP3.pm.  That was the error you were getting.

> Wait for it...creating /etc/httpd/Apache/MP3.pm solved it!  That's

Actually, this would have come to you if you'd walked through it kind of
carefully.

You'll probably find that /etc/httpd is in @INC when perl is invoked via
Apache and Apache/MP3.pm is what perl wsa trying to find.

Personally, I'd recommend installing the package in a more conventional
location.  Did you do a CPAN install of this thing or did you just
retrieve and build it with CPAN?

Perhaps the wine is more part of the problem than the solution.

Yes, sometimes from the shell and sometimes locally and yes I use
fetchmail when reading it locally.

procmail is called from within my .forward

"|IFS=' '&&exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #login"

Isn't that sufficient to call procmail?

The bottom lines say:

Adam Shand of the  Personal Telco Project in Portland, Ore., said he's 
negotiated agreements with two small Web providers in the Portland area.

"Some ISPs say, 'What, are you crazy?'" he said. "Others, say, 'Why not? 
If it causes a problem, we'll let you know.'" 


Unfortunately, the article is about how broadband providers are cracking

I've got the two heads running just fine.
I've got the virtual desktop running under a single
KDE invocation (KDE-2.2.2) so I can slide a window
across screens.

But there is some very annoying behaviour that I can't seem
to rid myself of:

-- If I horizontally maximise, say, an emacs window it
   maximises across the _entire_ virtual desktop, which, in most cases,
   is the wrong thing to do.

-- When the kde screensaver comes up, it is centered in the virtual
   desktop not in one of the physical desktops---again the wrong
   thing to do.

I've wasted a lot of time poking around in google and all I've
discovered is that KDE 2.2.2 is supposed to be "xinerama-aware" but, from
the above behaviour, it clearly isn't.

What do I need to do to get kde to understand that I'm running
xinerama?  I'm running Mandrake 8.2 with stock KDE.

Well, I added the path to the .procmailrc and now things work perfectly!
  
Also, I changed each /dev/null to spam
  
And then I pretended to be a spammer to see if my filter catches things   
and it worked for a few things that I tried. If it succeeds at catching

Anyone think that is a bad idea? Changing it back to /dev/null after it   
works well for, say, a week or two?

Ah, it will be nice to be relatively spam free.

I use Cyrus and Sieve to do much the same thing and have it split:
those rules of whose functioning I have no doubt I set to the sieve
equivalent of /dev/null and new rules or rules which I know *might*
catch legitimate emails I have dump into spam and occasionally I go
through "Select All->Delete->Expunge" if I don't see any emails I want
to keep.  Much better than having to manually delete the mails from my
inbox that are spam.  Still have to deal with (some) of them, but it's
much more managable.

I agree /etc/httpd/ is a stupid place for this module, but I now know it 
works (with IE anyway).

I had grabbed a tarball which needed MP3::Info to be happy.  I only found 
the interactive shell invocation in the 40-page CPAN man.  So, that worked, 
but the notes never said where MP3.pm should end up.

So just now, I decide to use CPAN again to `install Apache::MP3` and it

Okay Dad.  I tried on another Mozilla client and it looks I need to diddle

Message-ID: <3D2B163B.E18005C7@attbi.com>

What do I need to run to get my network connection back without
rebooting?

When I close the lid (without shutting down first) on my Thinkpad it
goes into some kind of suspend mode. When I open the lid it comes out of
that mode. Unfortunately, the machine appears to lose its network
connection. It will work fine if I reboot, but I'm sure that's not
really necessary in the Linux world; I just don't know the program to
restart. I'm currently using RH 7.1.

Try this as root:

   ifconfig eth0 down

   ifconfig eth0 up

Also, does the BIOS have a setting that can prevent the power saving
features from affecting the Ethernet interface?

Try '/etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart'; it's hacky, but better than a 
reboot.

First, check to see if the modules are still loaded --  lsmod before and
after closing the lid.  If they are still loaded, you should be able to 

ifdown eth0

ifup eth0

or just pop the card out, then stuff it back in, that should reset it.
 
Good Luck

No complaints when I did that.

"SIOCSIFFLAGS: No such device" when I did that.

Don't know, but it doesn't have this problem with Win98. I'm trying to
figure this out without shutting down, so I won't be able to look at the
BIOS settings just yet.

When I did that I got:

Disabling IPv4 packet forwarding:   [ OK ]
Setting network parameters:         [ OK ]
Bringing up interface lo:           [ OK ]
Bringing up interface eth0:         [ OK ]

However, I still didn't have a network connection.

Any other ideas before I reboot?

After opening the lid, I ran lsmod and found (among other stuff):

Module			 Size	Used by
3c589_cs		 8320	 0
ds			 7280	 2 [3c589_cs]

Didn't work.

This worked. This it the first, and only, PCMCIA card I've ever used.
I'm not used to having the ability to hot-swap! That was pretty simple.
On the other hand, it seems like I shouldn't have to do it; after all, I
don't have to do it if the laptop is running Win98.

I guess, for now, I won't worry about it. I'll be re-loading this
machine with Debian soon. I'll pick it up again when I get that done.

Thanks to all for your help.

Yeah, gather some info before the reboot and compare it to what you 
get when things are working correctly:

$ lsmod > /tmp/old.lsmod
$ route > /tmp/old.route
$ ifconfig > /tmp/old.ifconfig

Once you've rebooted and things are working correctly, see if there 
are any substantial differences between the /tmp/old.* files and the 
working configuration.

Assuming that the driver is a module rather than being hard linked into
the kernel, you will probably need to:

   1 - Bring the interface down using either "ifdown eth0" or by using the
       stop command with the appropriate /etc/init.d/xxxxx script to shut
       down the network interface.

   2 - Remove the kernel module for the network card using the
       "rmmod <ethernet_card_module_name>" command.

   3 - Insert the kernel module for the network card using the
       "insmod <ethernet_card_module_name>" command.

   4 - Bring the ethernet interface back up using the "ifup eth0" or by
       using the start command with the appropriate /etc/init.d/xxxx
       script to restart the network interface.

The reason for the above is that many drivers are poorly behaved when
handling standby mode (this is true for pretty much every operating
system), and will lose track of interrupts or other data when cycled
through it.  By doing the above, the driver is removed from the system,
and by reinstalling it, it will go through full reinitialization which
should clear the problem.  Once you have verified if this will work, you
can put the above in a simple shell script that can be run manually, or
launched by the APM software on your system to make it recover
automatically.

I think there's a script that you can run on suspend and wake-up.  In the
world of debian, it's something like /etc/apmd/post-wake.  Just make it
either restart the cardmanager or rescan the slots.  The debian package asks
you which one you want to do.  I forget which one I use, I just know that it
works ;^)

The only time you should have to reboot Linux is after a hardware or kernel upgrade.  :-)

If RH utilizes PCMCIA stuff like Slackware does, then you might (should) be able to just run 

/etc/pcmcia/network stop eth0
/etc/pcmcia/network start eth0

And it should work.  If that doesn't work, stop it, pull the card out, put the card back in, and start it, maybe.  I really don't know how RH uses PCMCIA services, though.  It wouldn't surprise me at all if they did it totally different than Slackware.

If this and the other suggestions don't fix the problem, it almost sounds like it could be related to the hardware.  Have you checked for a BIOS upgrade?

When it doesn't come back up after resuming, do your routing tables look the same?

Sorta riffing off AthonRob and Paul Heinlein here:

You mentioned that removing/reseating the pcmcia card works. In my 
experience, in Redhat a:

/sbin/service pcmcia restart    #similar/identical? to above suggestion

will have the desired effect, i.e. the card resets, w/ beep and all. If 
the interface doesn't get ifup'ed on it's own, just follow that with:

/sbin/service network restart

or Mr. Heinlein's equivalent and more generic:

/etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart

This combo seems to clear up weirdness I've had when dinking with my 
orinoco wi-fi card at home. YMMV.

Subject: [PLUG] which NIC is which
Message-ID: <20020709204537.GD26977@lnx2.labnet>

I'm building routers.  It's difficult to tell in advance which NIC will
be assigned eth0 and which will assigned eth1 when using two NICs.  Ping
testing usually clears up the identification problem.

The identification problem gets worse when adding a third NIC, after
sorting out the first two NICs.  Frequently the eth0 or eth1 assignment
for the first two NICs change.

Of course adding a fourth and fifth NIC multiplies the identification
problem.  Yes, some of my routers are supporting five network segments.

My question is, what's the algorithm for assigning Ethernet
designations?  I know it not placement order in the PCI bus, and I know
its not the NIC data-link address.

So what is it?

Thanks ...John

I/O Address I think.  Say,  0x240 will load before 0x320.

So, if you can massage those you can massage NIC assignments.

Might have to do with the order modules are loaded.  I really don't
know, so I'd appreciate a definitive answer also.  

If you _really_ want to get interfaces deterministically, probably
need something that will get-eth-by-mac-address.  Find out what mac
address the NIC has and then compute the interface and assign it to an
environment variable and the use that in your configuration script.

I know the order of the modules can change the eth ordering, but if you
use the same module for all cards, it will be determined by how the
kernel probes the pci bus.  I think that will be by I/O address, but I'm
not positive.  This could be tested with cards that allow hard-setting
of the I/O and some time swapping cards.

I checked, and debian has an /etc/apm/event.d that it runs whenever it suspends
or resumes.  It has a pcmcia script in there which starts and stops the pcmcia
driver whenever you make an apm event.  It's all configured via
/etc/pcmcia/apm.conf  which has one line in it... on or off.

Another factor will be the characteristics of the driver;  for example the
3c503.o looks for default IO addresses,  in a certain order.
If you have a 3c503 set up with a non-default ( as defined by the driver )
IO port it might skip the lower IO port card for the first card with a
driver hard-coded port.

Unfortunately this is the correct behavior for Xinerama.  It treats
both heads as one big virtual desktop.  

You can run without Xinerama and lose the ability to drag windows
between heads, X will treat the two heads as different screens.  The
first head is :0.0 and the second head is :0.1 etc.  You can run
programs on different screens by adjusting your $DISPLAY, you just
can't drag things between them, and you would end up having different
virtual desktops for each display.  So you can mix and match virtual
desktops on each screen, e.g. :0.0 showing virtual desktop 1 and :0.1
showing virtual desktop 2.  Progams will be limited to the screen they
were run on and maximize accordingly.

To do this just turn off Xinerema and make sure the KDE window manager
supports multiple screens as it is the window manager's responiblity
to do so.  I use ctwm which requires an extra switch to start up on
all available screens. I know enlightenment also supports multiple
screens too.

Hope this clears things up.

BTW with an AGP and PCI matrox card it is possible to do 4 heads.
I highly suggest it.

[snip]

Not entirely correct, Xinerama is just the way the X display behaves, it
is your window manager that determines the behavior when you maximize the
window.  What is needed is a Xinerama aware window manager that operates
in the manner you expect, or which can at least be configured to operate
this way.  There are at least two or three window managers which are
Xinerama aware in their more recent versions, and will behave in a
somewhat more correct manner.  I am currently using Enlightenment with my
setup as it seemed to work the best for me (though I think it is one of
the most bloated window managers around), and maximizing a window only
maximizes it on the current display.  I am not sure what the screen saver
does as I use a rather bland one that has no real center point so I don't
know if it is centered or not.  I am currently running it with Gnome, but
I think it is also KDE aware.

      as we will not have a projector available and a lot of
      people are out of town on vacation.

      However, come and order Pizza and beer and we will
      discuss whatever comes up.  We have done this in the past
      and it actually works out well to have a session devoted
      to problems and short topics from time to time.

      **********************************************************



          Agenda:

              7:00 - 7:30  Business
                   We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects
                   including the monthly hands on clinics, PLUG for
                   Education, etc.

              7:30 - 8:30  Presentation

                   See above

              9:00 - ...  Beer
                   Instead of going to The Lucky Labrador like usual,
                   we are have beer and pizza during the meeting.

 Thanks, I have decided to roll back to RH 7.2. I had too many 
glitches with 7.3, Xfree and other programs. Also KDE 3.0 is
too slow and I can't stand gnome. :)

I'm using spamassassin, not hand-rolled spam filter rules, but the
general principal is the same, in that unless you consider the
possibility of lost legitimate email unimportant, I would recommend
against sending it to /dev/null. 

I dump my likely spam to a folder that every couple of weeks I open
to see if it trapped any legitimate mail. Because I abhor the thought
of spam taking up any more precious disk space than necessary, I have
procmail gzip it -- here's my relavent procmail rule:

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes,
| gzip >> spam.gz

Mutt, with the compressed folder patch applied, will read that just like
any other normal (uncompressed) mail folder. 

> Ah, it will be nice to be relatively spam free.

Indeed, spamassasin, while not perfect, has made a significant
improvement to my email.

Can't offer favorites because I use them so rarely.  I have installed and 
used W3Mail but because I didn't use it a lot and it was installed as a 
stop-gap for s few customers I never checked if all the features worked 
and how well they worked.  One really neat feature was it allowed multiple 
POP/IMAP servers.  So I could allow someone to get to their account on  
adifferent system if their service provider didn't off (or had a brain 
desd) webmail.
   I just started installing sparkle (aka. acmemail).  I've lurked on the
mailing list for awhile and choose it becuase it looks nice
(user-interface) and real effort was being placed towards defaging
attachments and IMAP/folder support.

I should have it installed in a couple of days and will let you know what 
I think of it.

My vote for the obvious solution goes to IMAP over SSL, easily handled

I can't answer your question, but if you do get a notebook avoid the
Trident CyberBlade video card.  I got a great deal on a Compaq Presario
but I didn't realize that the CyberBlade was the video card (apparently
it is not uncommon in notebooks) and it is only somewhat supported in X.

Check out twiggi, I and several friends have been using it for several
months now and works great. The only negative is that it is a bit
sluggish. 'Course, this could be because I'm running it in on a 166mhz

IMAP running on port 8080 to get through the corporate firewall?

SysAdmin Magazine just had an article on squirrelmail.  The author 
considered it a "no contest" winner.

Hey Steve.

That seems to be the consensus. I am now sending all spam to a spam mail
folder.

Today I have added as I am sick of all the spam from *.tw:

:0
*^From:.*com.tw
spam

:0
*^From:.*net.tw
spam

You guys know the spam which, if you have HTML turned on usually has a
picture of someone on a skateboard and so on. I find those spams second in
irritation only to the spam that "Welcomes" you to a daily email
announcement list.

Or the alternative is to let them ssh in and start a shell session and use
pine or whatever to read their mail. That is what I did while in Europe.
Stop in a Cybercafe, and quickly go through my email. I tried Webmail and
it was a bit slow and cumbersome.

I'll second the Squirrelmail recommendation. It's pure HTML (if you 
avoid the javascript spellchecker and a few other doodads) and lots of 
plugins are available.

No! No! Stop! I was kidding.  

	a) he was asking about how to help his *nix illiterate roomates, No corp firewalls involved
	b) Your security department will not look upon this kindly
	c) I'd really hate to disable access to port 8080 after someone uses this idea

Hi:

I am trying to find any linux drivers for the SmartDisk FlashPath
floppy that is used for the memory for digital cameras.

Has any of you had experience using these under Linux?

I tried the Smartdisk web site and all they had for download
were Windows and Mac.

Thank you

I appreciate all the input.  I guess I should have mentioned that it has to do POP3 as my home mail box is a POP3 
machine, and the whole ssh-ing in thing is out - Like I said, they're *nix illiterate, and would run scared for the 
hills if they even saw a command line prompt.  It has to be something they can http to from any computer at school, 
work, home or girlfriends house.

I noticed somebody reccommended neomail.  I tried "openmail", which is based on neomail.  Unfortunately, it has to run 
setuid root, and as my machine is a little 120MHz box, the setuid gets caught in the race condition and just gives me a 
"Can't do setuid".

Hello Linux folkz,
I want to be able to securely telnet to my box over Internet.
If I would do it over SSL it means that another outside box I'm
telneting from should have SSL installed as well, but it's not always
possible.
Is there any way to secure telnet connection if SSL is not available
on a client outside box.
Thank you in advance for any thoughts or suggestions.

Gee, you must not get much spam. :)

I look through the spam folder all the time, because I get between 20 and 50 spams per day. If I let it build up for a week, I'd be there for an hour checking to see if there's anything legitimate. I've had spamassassin running for 6 months now, and it's maybe caught 5 legitimate emails as spam. But you are correct. Sending it to /dev/null is final. You'll never know if something DOES start getting misdirected. 

Instead of zipping it, I just delete it after looking through the folder. No problem, no storage. :)

We use neomail as part of the Netule EM-I email server.
We selected it after testing a number of alternatives.

For the most part we are quite happy with neomail.
It is simple and easy to use and generally works well.
We set it up be accessed via ssl which is nice.
However,
    (1)  We wish it had a spell checker built-in.
    (2)  We wish it had a system to build procmail or
         other SPAM control rules.
    (3)  We wish it had a few more features, but for
         our purposes nothing real important is missing.
    (4)  It hasn't handle super huge posting well.
         Neomail will try to put a 100+ mb posting in
         RAM, which can lead to bad things - like frozen
         systems.  Fortunately, this rarely happens in
         practice and one can prevent this by banning
         super huge postings in sendmail or postfix or
         whereever.
Overall, we like neomail but may consider alternatives
in the future.

                                          Sincerely,

I nominate SquirrelMail for your consideration. It's a PHP-based
IMAP client with special attention paid to making sure it works with
every imaginable browser. It has an active developer community and
is extendable via a plug-in architecture.

This is not, in general,  correct, though for "xinerama-unaware"
window managers, it  is.

For a "xinerama-aware" window manager (like KDE-2.2.2 is supposed to
be) the WM is aware that the large desktop is made up of two or more
physical displays, and does "the right thing" w.r.t. window
maximisation &c.

Again, not an option.  I'm running just one card: the new AGP

driving a digital flat panel.

Somewhat OT, somewhat not . . .

Yesterday, I received one of my periodic mailings from the Computer
Society (affiliated with IEEE), & while scanning thru it I found
a paragraph that was soliciting nominations for the 20 different
awards it gives every year. More about this at

http://computer.org/awards

And this got me thinking . . .  How many people in the Open Source
community have won one of these awards? I looked thru the list
& outside of awards granted to Tim Bernard-Lee & the two authors
of Mosaic (Bina & Andressen), there's been few. So I came up with
a pair of candidates I'd like help nominating for these honors:

For the Computer Society Technical Achievement award, Venema
Wietse. He has done a good chunk of work in security development,
writing programs such as SATAN, tcp-wrappers, & postfix.

For the Seymour Cray Computer Sience and Engineering Award, I'd
like to nominate Donald Becker. (Despite his feud with the rest
of the Linux community.) By creating the Beowulf cluster, he has
made supercomputing affordable to practically anyone with an
interest in this field. (Networking 50 Pentium IIIs together is
far cheaper than buying a top-of-the-line supercomputer from Cray
or SGI, & is far easier to maintain.)

Anyone a member in a professional organization who would like to
participate? (Nominations for the Cray award are due in at the
end of the month, for the Technical Achievement award, end of
September.)

Any thoughts?

Geoff

You must have a ssl client.  If you're going to be lost in Windowsland 
look a PuTTY.  Besides the SSH client it comes with a bunch of other neat 
programs.  The best part is you don't have to install it.  Place the 
putty.exe on a floppy and stick it in your pocket.  Not sure about MAC OS
versions.
   I went so far as to place PuTTY and friends and a few other 
deal-with-windows programs on one of those 50 MByte Credit Card sized 
CDROMs.  Less chance of the x-rays killing it, most computers have a CDROM 
drive, and it makes you look ultra-techie when you pull it out of your 
pocket or in my case a Levenger Pocket Brief Case.

OK, slightly off-topic but I know there is a large mozilla contingent
out there :-)

I refuse to install that worthless waste of time known as shockwave.

The problem is that pages with shockwave cause mozilla to ask me if I
want to download the plugin.

Does anybody have any idea on how to turn that off ?

I tried putting in a "fake" entry in applications/helpers.  I figured
I could save it to /dev/null or something - but it's still asking me.

Grrr.

Thanks

Doing a grep -l 'Donald Becker' in the kernel source drivers/net

Subject: [PLUG] A Word from the SysAdmin squirrelmail article author
Message-ID: <20020710130301.C6791@patch.com>

The name looked familiar so I ping'ed the author of the SysAdmin 
magazine article.  Sure enough, he was someone I'd met briefly in
Albuquerque in the late 80s.  If I recall correctly he was a
sendmail admin at Los Alamos for awhile in 89 or so.

Here are some comments he had on web mail services.

---- begin of forwarded mail ----

   But this was s'posed to be 'bout webmail.  Yeah, I'd run squirrelmail
rather than just exposing IMAP on port 8080.  Even if your IMAP server
supports ssl and you've got it configured so the ssl port is on 8080,
it's another point of attack on your machine.  And IMAP servers tend to
be less easily kept secured than, say, Apache.  There've been several
remotely exploitable hacks for various IMAP servers in the past few years,
but very very few serious holes in Apache in the last 7 years at
least. :-)

   My preferred method is to run Apache/PHP/mod_ssl on one machine, expose
ONLY port 443 to the outside world (or perhaps port 8443 - whatever port
you configure apache/mod_ssl to listen on).  Then have your IMAP server be
on a separate machine entirely.  That way, you can configure a firewall
between the outside world and your Apache webserver, and even if they DO
manage to hack squirrelmail or Apache, there's nothin' on the server
itself for them to download (except for perhaps your squirrelmail
preferences).  No username/password pairs are stored on the squirrelmail
server -- that's all on the IMAP server.

   And since you only expose https to the outside world, when you log in
you won't be sharing your password with anyone between you and the
webserver armed with a network sniffer. :-) And there's another side
benefit to only exposing the SSL port on the webserver.  When (not if, but
when) another security hole in your webserver of choice is found, the
crackers will be portscanning on port 80 for webservers to break in to.
I see thousands of portscands per day on port 80, but never on port 443.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0207101302480.11812-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  After replacing (rather, having replaced) the CMOS battery and the main
battery on my Toshiba Portege 3025CT, the date was still not keeping
current. Using the 'date' command did no good; it didn't hold. Northwest
Computer Support's tech told me that it was probably the clock chip and that
means replacing the system board for about $500.

  When I was out of town earlier this week, I noticed that the date was
rolling along, but still read January, 1990. This morning, on a hunch, I
re-read the hwclock man page and then reset the hardware clock. Sure enough,
the system clock -- set by the 'date' command -- followed along even after
reboots.

  So the lesson for today is check whether or not the hardware clock lost
its way and needs to be reset before doing anything else. In the grand
scheme of things, it was probably a good investment, after three years of
use, to replace both batteries but they were not the problem.

Hope this saves someone some aggrevation and distraction,

Rich

Shift+Page UP and Shift+Page Dn will do it.  If you hit scrollock it,
oddly enough, stops the screen from scrolling, because otherwise your
terminal will jump to the bottom on any output.

If you're looking for something with spell checking and handles large mail well, try "OpenMail".  It's based on NeoMail, but 
has many added features.  You should be able to find the OpenMail project at openmail.org.

You may want to try netdate(1) along with hwclock(1) in an automated
timekeeping scheme.

To save you time if you try netdate, I've included my current top 12
favorite level-2 public ntp servers follow. These were culled from a very
large list and selected for reliability, short netlag-times, and relative
agreement of reported timesignals.
	cs.columbia.edu
	CYAN.SRV.cs.cmu.edu
	eagle.tamu.edu
	FS1.ece.cmu.edu
	LEMON.SRV.cs.cmu.edu
	salmon.maths.tcd.ie

Of course, YMMV.

What tree should I bark up to get more than 24 lines per screen? (and more 
columns)  I seem to remember this had something to do with a frame buffer? 
Is it a boot-time option only?

Frame buffer should work for ya.  What distro are you in?

It should (I think, somebody correct me if I'm wrong) be as simple as compiling framebuffer support into your kernel and passing the proper VGA= line to the kernel via lilo.conf.  I use 788; 800x600x64k.

Slackware kernels have framebuffer support compiled in by default and it is very easy to turn it on.  I really don't know if RH and Mandrake would compile it in, though... their target users are usually in X, so don't need the framebuffer eating up memory in the background.

HTH,
Rob

Following up on my own very late and now obsolete post (it got held
up for several hours on the list server), SquirrelMail does have a POP3 
plugin. So it's not strictly limited to IMAP.

RH 7.3--I recently discovered that if you install the kernel-sources rpm, it 
places the config file in /boot.  Looks like they did compile it in.

I remember setting up lilo once (somewhere) for 'vga=ask'.  I'll look for 
the comprable command for grub.

Subject: [PLUG] Zip Archiver not in PATH
Message-ID: <20020710224328.AE93834A88@ados.com>

The 'tyranny of the blank screen' strikes again!*

I'm trying to use Archiver, and I get a union-excuse:
"Sorry, the zip utility is not in your PATH."

Som my immediate question/goal is: "How do I 'put the utility in the PATH' so 
that the $#$%!! thing RUNS with no more such backtalk?"

I looked up 'path' in the following books:
'Linux A -Z' (Cornes)
'Linux in a Nutshell' (Siever/O'Reilly)
'Linux! I Didn't know you could do that...' (Sybex)

No help there (no easy way to locate an explanation of what a PATH is and 
what do do with it.)

However, I -almost- hit paydirt with 'Running Linux' (Welsh&Kaufman/O'Reilly)
which actually demonstrates:
$echo $PATH
[I got:   /usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin ]

and that book also mentions "$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/[some other directory]" 
and "set path = ( $PATH /usr/[someother directory] )"

OK, cool. I think I can do this. But I did a 'Find File' in KDE and found 
that 'ark' is already living in /usr/bin/. So why won't 'ark' obey the 
command?

Any hints for the last lap of this question?

GLL


*First coined by a consumer product designer who said that early computer 
users were confused by the "READY>" prompt ('Ready to do what?') and early 
versions of WordPerfect which presented a completely blank screen except for 
a handful of characters at the bottom of the screen - ("How do I use this 
thing? Where's PRINT?" etc.) In this case, a menu item in KDE called 'PATH 
Manager' or something, would be useful. Something I can SEE and CLICK ON.

Hi Kyle,

Just to warn you, I had to take frame buffers out of my kernel to keep
my Nvidia card from locking up when switching from X to console then
back to X.

I have found that multiple X-servers is a pretty good way to go, each
server can have many virtual desktops and I like being able to change
resolution on the fly.

I just thought you should know.

Subject: [PLUG] Cheap Colocation For Little Used Server
Message-ID: <20020710160341.10f7aec3.jason@vancleve.com>

Hi,

I'm fleeing the country next month (speaking figuratively), and, not
sure exactly when I'll be back, I'm giving up my apartment. Which means
I need a new home for my server, since I run postfix on it and a couple
of dev' Web sites that I'd like to keep online.  I'm wondering if anyone
can suggest any inexpensive colocation options.

I don't require a professional service with UPS and climate control and
multiple connections and all that; I just need a static IP and a mere
modicum of bandwidth.  It's basically just an email server for maybe a
half dozen accounts.  The Web sites are unfinished and get almost no
traffic.  It also runs CVS for just my personal use.  In fact, this box
would be happy to run headless in a closet in someone's basement,
virtually unnoticable.  It's running SuSE 7.1, and it hasn't gone down,
save for power outages, since I installed it many moons hence, so there
should be no question of onsite maintenance.

I've just looked at EasyStreet, and their service starts at $350/month,
which is just way too much for what I need.  I'm actually hoping someone
on this list won't mind housing this server in exchange for a line
upgrade, a couple more IPs, and maybe something extra just in case a
manual reboot is ever needed.

Any takers?

The only feature I would grovel for in Squirrel mail
is OpenPGP support. There are a few webmail packages
out there that support it, but none nearly as cool as
the little rodent with a nut.

Wonder if that's what had happened when I was running RH 7.2.  When I'd 
alt-tab to a vc, there would be pretty flashing garbage.  Could switch back 
to X just fine, but the vc's were unusable.

I really wanted this for the laptop and it works great so far.  It's a 
little slow switching back to X and I may play with the depth settings.

BTW, there is no difference when using grub since `vga` is a kernel command 
line option.  The really nice thing about grub is that you can edit such a 
thing before you boot.

  If it's not too late for me to contribute to the thread, I just received
my copy of "Multitool Linux", a different type of linux book that focuses on
what one can do with open source/free software to provide tools in a number
of different areas of need. One of the chapters is dedicated to "build[ing]
a secure Webmail service supporting IMAP and SSL". It's Chapter 8; pages
157-178. Step-by-step instructions.

You might try Internet Arena for colocation, they start cheap and you
get what you pay for.. but I believe they start at round $100/mo for a
few IPs and something like 2Mbits of bandwidth.

Hi Jason,

A line upgrade for my DSL to go from 640k to 1M (not sure if my Cisco
678 can do this though) would be about $50 per month, and an extra IP I
think is about $5.  Power use may need a small consideration too.  Is
that what you had in mind?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0207101735570.4795-100000@localhost.localdomain>

Yesterday my Cisco 678 router arrived in the mail. Since it was so HOT
outside today I figured I would set up my DSL.

... 6 Hours Later ...

Still no DSL. Are any of you successfully using a Cisco 678 router on
Linux? Can you help me out?

Specs
-----
RH 7.1
Kernel 2.4.2-2
Cisco 678 Router
3Com 95x NIC
DSL provider: Qwest
ISP provider: Qwest
Protocol: ppp
IP address: dynamic

Steps
-----
1) I started with the DSL HOW-TO
   http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/DSL-HOWTO/index.html
2) Since I am using PPP I then moved to the Roaring Penguine
   http://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe/
   on this page I read that if I have a router then
   I may not need PPPoE, I should use DHCP.
3) I then hit the PLUG archive and found a thread on
   the Cisco 678. http://plug.skylab.org/200108/msg00194.html
   This message referenced some other docs that are no
   longer available and I was unable to find a cached version
   http://www.users.qwest.net/~agondor/docs/678/678.html
4) Back to google, and I found a rather helpful page
   http://www.getnet.com/~awagner/Page4.html
   With the information in this page I was able to
   minicom into the router and set some things up,
   however this article was for a static IP using rfc1483
   I have a dynamic IP with dynamic ip but there wasn't
   information specific to this.
5) After configuring the router I restarted my network
   with eth0 BOOTPROTO=dhcp. It just hung on the eth0
   startup and was unable to find an IP.

What I don't know (pretty much everything)
-----------------
- I don't know how to correctly configure the router.

- I don't know what to do on my workstation once the
  router is working properly.


Thanks in advanced-
Michael

 If they are installed then the file name and path will be displayed.
edit your .bash_profile add the path to PATH and login. 
If not then install then from your distro or the sources.

First question: Is the WAN Link led on the 678 lit?  If not, qwest may not 
have turned on your circuit yet.  If it is then success is imminent.

My 678 is running in bridged mode, and it looks like you need to be running 
in routed mode.  The ISP (Qwest in your case) should tell you for sure.

Betting someone on the list has more direct experience with your particular 
configuration.  It'll work fine...

"locate" is fine as long as the file database is kept up to date. 
"which" on the other hand goes though the PATH environment variable and 
attempts to find an executable by the specified name.

Not correct then but historical, since there really isn't a right way
to do anything in X, it's all window manager policy.

How would you expect a window spanning two heads to maximize, vertical
to the full height, but is it supposed to have a width the size of one
head, or fill both heads.

Centering in the middle would also seem be the "correct" thing to do when
running tri-head.

I'm also not sure how virtual desktops are expected to work in
Xinerema, they can't split heads because there could be a window
spanning the heads.

It's a shame, because 4 is better than 2.

The matrox g200-mms should support 4 DVI per card, and in theory with AGP and
PCI you could do eight or more.  Surround-screen perhaps.

I can answer that.  Plugger is a mime-type handler for Mozilla/Netscape 
(others?).  At least those two projects have been off-loading the concept of 
Helper Applications to plugger.

If you are using one of those browsers (sorry, forgot if you mentioned that 
before), go to Help | About Plug-ins.  If you see Plugger, then you're 
already using it.

Anyway, the home page is here, http://www.hubbe.net/~hubbe/plugger.html
The config file resides in /etc/pluggerrc.  The man page is okay, but I 
still can't figure out how to launch xmms properly when the browser 
encounters an .m3u extension.

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

Having just set this up on my own box, you just need to do the following:

Comment out the lines

SYSFONT="lat0-sun16"
SYSFONTACM="iso15"

in /etc/sysconfig/i18n. If you don't do this, then when the system loads the default fonts, it switches back to 25 line mode.

Then add vga=# to the kernel line in /etc/grub.conf. Mine looks like this:

kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.18-5 ro root=/dev/hda6 hdc=ide-scsi vga=6

If you want to experiment with different modes, replace the # with "ask".

Maybe this is an obvious question, but why don't you just use Secure
Shell?  It's a replacement for telnet that encrypts, authenticates, etc.

http://www.openssh.org

or for Win32:

After finding where it is, you can set your path as you already stated. 
Or you could move it (look up mv, if you don't already know that one) or
you can create a symbolic link by using the ln -s command.

I like it, even when I have to manually update the database.

As root, just run updatedb and you're up and going.  :-)

Then the locate command works great.

After my first post on this subject it made me curious as to when the 
file database is updated on my system. I found that a daily cronjob is 
run to update the database on my system. I would guess that most of the 
"modern" distros do this.

It looks like you're S.O.L., Mark. Smartdisk did have a driver for RH6.2 and
the 2.2.x kernels, but it appears to have been withdrawn. Proof that it did
exist is here...

http://www.ricohzone.com/support/download/FlashPath/Documentation/LinuxInstallandUserGuide.pdf

...but I can't find the .tgz driver anywhere. Got USB? It's waaaay faster,
and then are plenty of devices for SmartMedia which work under linux.

I don't know how standard it is, but Slackware runs it every morning at 4AM.  Usually when most people are sleeping.

A problem comes up, though, for those who turn their PCs off at night.

			     PRESENTATION

			   Problem Session
		     We will discuss short topics


      I'm late announcing this meeting because I haven't been
      able to line up a speaker for July.  It has been a problem
      as we will not have a projector available and a lot of
      people are out of town on vacation.

      However, come and order Pizza and beer and we will
      discuss whatever comes up.  We have done this in the past
      and it actually works out well to have a session devoted
      to problems and short topics from time to time.

      **********************************************************



          Agenda:

              7:00 - 7:30  Business
                   We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects
                   including the monthly hands on clinics, PLUG for
                   Education, etc.

              7:30 - 8:30  Presentation

                   See above

              9:00 - ...  Beer
                   Instead of going to The Lucky Labrador like usual,
                   we are have beer and pizza during the meeting.

When does this system load these fonts?  If it's at boot time or when X 
starts, then it doesn't seem to have affected me.

I'm running SuSE 8.0 on several systems not all of which run 24/7. On 
those systems I power on and off, the daily maintenance tasks seem to 
run automatically not too long after the system boots up. There must be 
some hourly task that checks how long since the daily maintenance was 
run or something like that.

What's the point of having a computer if you aren't going to crunch SETI at Home units on it 24/7?  :-)

Actually, I powered down my SPARC and Alpha yesterday because it 
promised to get too hot in my home office and I didn't want to resort 
to turning on the AC. My main x86 box, however, remains on...

It does it during boot. When it sets the system locale. The lines I listed 
are the default for the English (US) locale.

I just know that my system booted in 60 line mode (vga=6) and then reverted 
to 25 line mode when it said, "Loading system fonts" during bootup. 
Commenting out those lines stopped the reversion.

   Hey, whaddya know!  Small world, eh?  Yeah, it's me, the Brent that
fooled around with ROS and some other BBSes (and even wrote my own in
interpreted basic on a NEC Z80 based machine with 64k of memory - grin).

   Remember John?  He's doin' consulting work for ARIN and some of the
other internet bigwigs, and starting up his own internet registrar service.
He ran a small ISP for a while before that.

   But this was s'posed to be 'bout webmail.  Yeah, I'd run squirrelmail
rather than just exposing IMAP on port 8080.  Even if your IMAP server
supports ssl and you've got it configured so the ssl port is on 8080,
it's another point of attack on your machine.  And IMAP servers tend to
be less easily kept secured than, say, Apache.  There've been several
remotely exploitable hacks for various IMAP servers in the past few years,
but very very few serious holes in Apache in the last 7 years at
least. :-)

   My preferred method is to run Apache/PHP/mod_ssl on one machine, expose
ONLY port 443 to the outside world (or perhaps port 8443 - whatever port
you configure apache/mod_ssl to listen on).  Then have your IMAP server be
on a separate machine entirely.  That way, you can configure a firewall
between the outside world and your Apache webserver, and even if they DO
manage to hack squirrelmail or Apache, there's nothin' on the server
itself for them to download (except for perhaps your squirrelmail
preferences).  No username/password pairs are stored on the squirrelmail
server -- that's all on the IMAP server.

   And since you only expose https to the outside world, when you log in
you won't be sharing your password with anyone between you and the
webserver armed with a network sniffer. :-) And there's another side
benefit to only exposing the SSL port on the webserver.  When (not if, but
when) another security hole in your webserver of choice is found, the
crackers will be portscanning on port 80 for webservers to break in to.
I see thousands of portscands per day on port 80, but never on port 443.

Message-ID: <20020710133608.A3251@xandy.linux-dude.com>

Hello ppl,

I would like to move my secure webserver certificate from iis5 to apache on a linux machine. I exported the cert from windoze in PKCS12 format w/key, then I tried splitting it into key and certificate with:

openssl pkcs12 -in cert.p12 -out server.crt -nokeys -clcerts -passin stdin

openssl pkcs12 -in cert.p12 -out server.key -nocerts -passin stdin -nodes 

After copying the files into place, restarting, etc. I get a message that says the certificate Im using is not acceptable for this use. If anybody tell me where I went wrong (export format?), or give me some  step by step instructions I would appreciate it.

PS: The problem is probably that your FTP client doesn't operate in
passive mode.  Read up on how FTP works through firewalls to understand
this problem.  Get the "ncftp" client and configure it for passive mode
only.

Having trouble witht ftp and, presumably, floppyfw. I can connect but can't
ls. I assume something is wrong in my settup.

Help.

Sounds like the recurring port 20 data connection problem.

You must allow incoming tcp on 20 as well as the usual 21.. for active ftp
connects to use the ls command.
Otherwise,  you're looking at trying passive mode ftp clients,  which is
pretty foolproof.
There is a ip_masq_ftp.o you can add to modules.lst and put in the /modules
dir of the floppy - corresponding to your kernel,  naturally.  It helps with
the active ftp port assignments with NAT etc.
There is a good news server at news.zelow.no with all the particulars also.

  Been there -- twice now.

  With the firewall, the ftp client you use needs to be in passive mode, not
active mode. In the former mode, the client determines the ports to be used
so the firewall will allow the return packets back in.

  NcFTP did this exceptionally well up to version 3.0.3. In this release, he
changed passive mode to 'extended' passive mode and many servers get
confused and cannot handle it.

  Connect to the server with vanilla ftp. Once logged in type 'passive'. You
should see the response of the command as it toggles passive mode on and
off. With passive mode on, type 'ls'. You'll almost certainly get the
results back. If not ... then it's time for tcpdump and ethereal.

Ha! I remembered someone on the list going round and round with this, but I 
couldn't rember who. I even remembered that it had something to do with 
passive mode, but couldn't remember how to use it. Thanks worked like a 
charm, even with a Windows client.

Strictly speaking, this isn't always true.  floppyfw can handle active mode
ftp just fine.  That's assuming you haven't edited modules.lst to remove
ip_masq_ftp.o, and that you have the appropriate firewall rules.  That said,
it's not unusual to have a firewall/server on the remote end be screwed
up such that active mode won't work.

Aye.  I'd just like to confirm that I use floppyfw and have never had any

Yes, I do have a 678 (qwest DSL) with several linux boxes routing
through it.
 Can you help me out?
I haven't set up pppoE, mine is in bridging mode.  When Qwest sent my
router, they also included a manual that had step by step instructions
for setting up the 2 different modes, if you didn't get the manual, then
Qwest tech support may be your best bet, they don't support linux fully,
but they don't hang up on you either.  It is their job to make sure that
the equipment they sent you is working and connecting to your ISP.  Let
them know that you can connect to the Cisco management port with a
terminal emulator and that you need help with the settings. 

BTW, make sure that you let them know that you NEVER want to be
transfered to MSN tech support.

Good Luck

About six months ago, I had the same issues.  I used minicom to
communicate with it.  If you google for minicomm and Cisco 678, you can
get help from the following pages:  (I can't remember exactly how I did
this, but I remember that there was lots of help on the web in relation
to minicomm.)

http://www.getnet.com/~awagner/Page4.html

Hope that helps. 

If you are still struggling, give me a holler.  Ultimately, I remember I
made the connection to the router with minicomm and then my ISP (not
qwest) walked me through what commands to use to set it up.

Bill:

That response was un-called-for, particularly since I *did* respond to
your problem with the correct solution.

I apologize if my attempt to improve your chances of getting technical
help from other open-source folks was ill-received.  On many (most)
mailing lists or newsgroups short problem descriptions with a plea for
help rarely get any response.

Again, I did not mean to offend and if I did, I apologize.

The List:

All further replies along these lines will be via E-mail to avoid clogging
up the list any further with useless messages.

Take the #15 Belmont bus.  It runs east on Salmon, then north on 2nd,
then east on Alder across the Morrison bridge.  15 minute frequency during
the day, more often during rush hour.  30 minute frequency after 9PM.

Try out the transit tracker on the tri-met web site.

Sorry, I forgot to tell you where to get off the bus.  Pull the cord when
you see Zupan's grocery on the left/north.  Get off at 34th and
walk back west 1/2 block.  Another hint is that there are traffic lights
at 30th and 34th.

That sounds good!  You wouldn't require a line upgrade, then?  I
shouldn't think so, but I thought I'd offer it as an incentive.  So
besides the $10, what's it worth to you, considering power consumption
(minimal), the possibility of a manual reboot or two, physical space
(?), etc?  I have a friend who said he'd do it for a couple extra IPs
(one for him), but yours appears to be a superior connection.

Here are some other questions:  about where are you located, and is this
your house, apartment?  Have you had any issues with your connection or
your power?  What are the chances of your relocating in the next year or
two?  Do you have a cap on your throughput (shouldn't be an issue with
this machine, but it's worth considering)?  Does your space keep
reasonably cool in the summer?

Thanks,

The owner made the paper today, too.  The story involved a system
development charge of $27k for the new location that he wanted
rescinded (since he just moved from across the street, he had a
reasonable argument that he wasn't adding or even significantly
changing the traffic generated).  The City Council commiserated with
him, but turned him down.  Something about it being a posthoc
request.

Also, be aware that the new IABP "meeting space" has some significant
"sound" issues.  The regular PLUG meeting just has to endure it one
time, then back to PSU next month, but the Advanced Topics meeting is
going to have to deal with this too.  I think the solution is going to
be one of two things: a) a different venue; or b) a microphone/sound
system of some kind.

Message-ID: <3D2E29B4.18797C1C@attbi.com>

I switched ISP's from SpiritOne to @home when cable modem service became
available. I dropped the SpiritOne account about a month or two after
getting the @home account. My old SpiritOne web site stayed up for
several months, but finally dissappeared. Before dropping the SpiritOne
account, I asked them to forward any e-mail to my new account. They
never dropped that forward (whatever you call it - order?), and in fact,
changed it last December when we switched from @home to @attbi. So, I
still get mail forwarded from SpiritOne on occassion, which has been
useful.

Today, I got a piece of spam that appears to be from my old SpiritOne
account. Can anyone tell me if there is anything in this header that
will help me figure out where it really came from?

Thanks in advance.

The only useful information I can see is the IP address: 80.90.162.37
everything else about the source appears to be forged.  This address is
part of a block owned by link.net in Amman, Jordan

Hi Dick,

One thing you might try is using SpamCop. www.spamcop.net. It will do the 
traces and reverse lookups for you, then you can study what it did. Then you 
can even use it to send abuse reports for you, if you like. I use the Web 
form, rather than forwarding emails, to see an analysis of the headers right 
away.

Subject: [PLUG] .AVI RPM player Advice
Message-ID: <20020712025218.EE6E23490F@ados.com>

Hello: 

I'm a 'user-level' type. I'm 'using' Mandrake 8.1 and KDE 2.2.1.

I've crawled all over SourceForge, Freshmeat, and RPMfind, trying to find a 
good AVI player that installs in one shot. Is anything out there ready for 
prime-time?

Wishful-thinking Procedure:
1. Go to Best Buy or Fry's.
2. Pay $19 or so for a box with a CD in it. Name on the box is irrelevant.
3. Slot the CD in a drive, go to KDE file mangler, and double click a file on 
the CD with a gear on it and a likely sounding name, like 'install.'
4. Press "OK" until all the dialog boxes go away. (Note: You do not have to 
actually *read* any of the dialog boxes. Think of playing 'Whack-a-mole,' but 
with your mouse pointer - the faster you hit those "OKs," the sooner you get 
to watch your AVI's. The fewer that appear, the better the program is.)
5. Double-click on my AVI files and have a few beers.

Desired (more realistic) procedure:
1. Download -One- rpm file from somewhere. Two rpm's max.
2. Double-click on it/them in KDE. (Command line? You must be joking. A 
double click -IS- a command: It means 'Computer, go and do your job 
correctly, and let me know when you're done!')
3. Make any/all dialog boxes go away (see 4. above.)
4. Same as 5. above.

Tell-me-it-ain't so: (any one of these is a show-stopper)
1. Download a tar.gz instead of an rpm.
2. Find out you need x-whatever, but that that in turn needs dll's which you 
have NO way of knowing whether you already have or not, or where they are.
3. Anything with the word 'Woody' in it.

I use Debian, so I don't know how much you might need with say RedHat,
but, I would go looking for Xine, it works well, and is pretty braindead
as far as using.  Works on a lot more then AVI's too.  another option
would be aviplay, and a third option would be video lan client.

Thanks to all of you who responded.

Like you all suggested, I called Qwest tech support, told them I was
connecting to the Cisco router through the management port with a terminal
emulator and had them walk me through the process.

Voila - the router works! I wish I had copied down the setting that they
gave me so that I could post them but I didn't.

Thanks again-

Yes, it worked out of the box--no configuration. I
have bridging mode, and would probably be reluctant to

Subject: [PLUG] duplicating an audio CD
Message-ID: <20020712044626.E649110E055@pons.enet.sharplabs.com>

I've never "dupped" an audio CD before so I have some questions.  From
reading the (rather old) HOWTO it appears that I want to write in
so-called DAO mode rather than TAO mode.

I've only got one CD-RW device right now so I presume I'm going to have
to "rip" the entire CD to disk then write it back to the blank.

My question: what format do I pull the data off in?  I see from the
cdparanoia man page that there's a so-called "raw" format.  Is that
what I use?  Do I need the entire CD image in one file for DAO?

Ok, as you can see, I know nothing.  A quick explaination of the specifics
would be greatly appreciated.

I'm not the expert on this stuff, but I've done it, so I'll write what I
know.

Yes.  But you can rip the tracks individually and then write them back to
the disc in any order.

The so-called "raw" format is, in fact, raw PCM audio with stereo channel
separation and at the appropriate sampling frequency.

It's basically a 16-bit 44.1Khz Stereo WAV, but without the WAV headers.

cdparanoia assumes you want file in WAV format, unless you specify
otherwise.

That's totally cool because cdrecord will recognize the .wav extension and
skip over the non-audio header stuff.

> Ok, as you can see, I know nothing.  A quick explaination of the

Actually, now that I think about it, I don't know that I've ever ripped a
CD directly into raw PCM audio.  I usually assemble CDs from MP3s,
normalize the audio, use mpg123 to dump to raw PCM and then write that to
disc.

However, you can do this, too:
cdparanoia -B
(switch discs when done)
cdrecord -speed=8 -dev=0,0,0 -audio track1.wav track2.wav (...)

And that's all there should be to it.

If you have some funny hardware, I can imagine having to twiddle
endianness, but try it straight first.

The files will literally be called track1.wav and so on.  If you use a
front-end to cdparanoia that does cddb lookups or something (I often use
grip), then your track names might be different.  I would recommend using
something like that and setting your filenames to start with the track
number (rather than having it inside the name somewhere) like this:
02-Track_Name.wav

That way, you can just do something like this with your cdrecord command
line:
cdrecord -speed=8 -dev=0,0,0 -audio *.wav

Neater.  Oh, and you don't need to specify speed and device if you've
already got a working config file for cdrecord.

I hope that's useful.  Somebody with more knowledge and experience with
audio will probably answer this, but I thought I'd answer now since
there's no answer on the list right this second and you might want to roll
up them shirtsleeves right now.

Hi Dick,

One thing you might try is using SpamCop. www.spamcop.net. It will do the 
traces and reverse lookups for you, then you can study what it did. Then you 
can even use it to send abuse reports for you, if you like. I use the Web 
form, rather than forwarding emails, to see an analysis of the headers right 
away.

I'm assuming that this list is for asking questions as well as meeting
announcement, so please let me know if not. 

I just upgraded from Redhat 7.2 to 7.3.  I was disappointed that in the
upgrade, the installer didn't seem to pickup the setting for X that were
there already.  Instead, it ran Xconfigurator.  My monitor was not on
the list and I couldn't remember the settings and guessed incorrectly,
so X was unusable for a while.  I managed to find the spec's for my
monitor later and ran Xconfigurator and selected custom monitor and
entered the settings I found.  Now it works pretty good except for one
thing.  The are 2 lines that follow my cursor around.  I have not been
able to find any reference to this anywhere.  Does anyone know how I
might fix this?

Thank you.

  I will second this suggestion with two caveats. First, sometimes spamcop
gets it wrong; not often, but sometimes. Second, the more important drawback
is that some providers refuse to accept the munged reports spamcop sends;
others just refuse spamcop reports.

  Here I use spamcop when it looks like tracing the correct source will take
more time than I wish to spend on the effort. Otherwise, I trace the source
and send them a canned request to shut down the spammer. For the known spam
factories or relayers, I just add their IP address or domain name to the
appropriate postfix filter.

  I have a couple of related questions for the group, but I'll put them in a
separate thread.

Subject: [PLUG] Odd Installation Problem
Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.01.10207120836330.6007-100000@newwind.com>

I've been trying to install Linux (SUSE 8.0) on the 2nd IDE drive on one of
our machines.  We already have it running on another machine (SCSI drives)
and as the only system on a machine at my office (IDE drives). I've
installed many versions of Linux and FreeBSD over the years since the days
it was distributed on floppies.

On this one machine I keep running into a weird problem no matter what
release of Linux or FreeBSD I try to install.  The first time the system
reboots after the base installation there's screen full of "01 01 01" and
the machine locks up.  This happens whether I install LILO (or the BSD boot
program) on the boot drive or if I create a boot floppy.  It doesn't matter. 
Fortunately I can do a FDISK/MBR to restore the boot sector on the hard
disk. The weird thing is that it boots perfectly off the CDROM.

I've checked all the BIOS settings and can't find anything odd.  If the 2nd
disk is formatted for Windows, it works just fine.  The Linux or BSD
installation goes fine until the reboot.  I've moved the 2nd disk from one
controller to the other and from master to slave - no difference. I've even
tried a different disk - same problem.

Has anyone run into this?  Do you know of a fix?

Thanks, DennisN

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0207120834460.18857-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Earlier this week I had the strange experience -- three times in a single
day -- of receiving a spam that was marked as coming from me, to me. I
didn't see any IP address in the headers other than my external one. So I
sent it to spamcop for analysis. Sure enough, it came back reporting that I
was spamming myself! I deleted the three messages but it stumped me
completely. Clever spammer; anoying SOB. Has anyone else experienced this?

  This is a postfix question that was not answered on the mailhelp mail
list. Perhaps someone here has the answer.

  When postfix checks the headers for an incoming message against the access
and smptd_client_restrictions files, it appears to look at only the topmost
received from line and ignore everything below. Here's the scenario: a
repeat spammer addresses the message to my secondary MX address rather than
the primary MX address. This means that the message goes to Aracnet's mail
server before plopping down here in my inbox. The originating IP address or
domain name are in the spam filters but not seen. Is this normal behavior?
Are there any changes I can make to catch and reject these messages?

TIA,

Rich

<soapbox>

Having been a technical support engineer for a large software firm, I 
cringe when I read something like this.

Expect software to work like a Kleenex (pull it out of the box and it's 
ready to use) and it will last about as long as a Kleenex.

Why do I say that?

Because software is not simple. It never has been. Software Engineers (I 
work with those still) can only anticipate so many permutations of the 
available hardware and software out there. There are literally millions, 
possibly billions of possible combinations. Many that aren't compatible in 
one way or another.

I'd say that reading the installation dialogs, or the README file, is every 
bit as important as reading the fine print that comes with your 
prescription medicine. One goes to your health, the other, to your PC.

If someone clicks 'OK' as fast as they can, and then it doesn't work as 
they expect, well, I have no sympathy for them.

 :: 4. Same as 5. above.

Desiring to not ever use the command line, especially when dealing
with installing anything "video" related is usually a pipedream.
Too many libraries involved.

Besides, how hard is it to type `rpm -Uvh foo.rpm' ?  Also the big
disadvantage of the Gooey method is that you often don't see what
errors occurred, so you can't even begin to address the problems.

Anyway I just did `rpm -q xanim' on my Mdk 8.2 machine and it returned
                                           ^^^

2001 medulla: deanm=>rpm -q xanim
xanim-28010-16mdk

I'm currently runnning six simutaneous .avi files for a research demo
so I know that that version of xanim will play (some) .avi's.

I say "some"  because .avi is not a single format but a family of formats.
Some are mpeg-2 encoded internally, some are coded in other ways.
I have no idea of all the capabilities of xanim.  I simply did
`xanim foo.avi &' (from the commandline :-) and it played (and I was
a happy camper).

My suggestion is to go to a mandrake mirror, download the .src.rpm
(not the binary .rpm).  I'm currently seeing the .src.rpm package in:

/pub/unix/Linux/Mandrake/Mandrake/8.2/SRPMS/xanim-28010-16mdk.src.rpm

on the machine sunsite.uio.no

which you get into  via anonymous ftp.


Put it somewhere (it does not matter),  say /tmp,
and follow these steps (mutatis mutandis):

1) rpm -i /tmp/foo.src.rpm
2) cd /usr/src/RPM/SPECS
3) rpm -bb foo.spec

At this point the .src.rpm will either unpack, compile, and generate
a binary .rpm for _your_ system with _your_ libraries, or you'll
get some sort of "missing  library" error upon which you get to start
treading the "dependency treadmill".  I hope it's the former but the latter
is not the end of the world and I will try to help you if you will wish.

4) cd usr/src/RPM/RPMS/<arch>
   where <arch> is i686 or whatever machine architecture you have.

5) rpm -Uvh foo.rpm

Again if all goes well you'll have xanim (or any other .rpm you wish
to build) installed on your system and you're on your way.  If not,
give us a yell and tell us what errors occured.

 :: Tell-me-it-ain't so: (any one of these is a show-stopper)
 :: 1. Download a tar.gz instead of an rpm.
 :: 2. Find out you need x-whatever, but that that in turn needs dll's which you

Subject: [PLUG] Hire the Best
Message-ID: <20020712165328.GA15685@lnx2.labnet>

Linux, UNIX, and network professionals seeking work in the Portland are
are running into the "buyers" market mentality.

This is illustrated by a recent Portland Area Cisco Users Group mailing
list posting by a hiring manager, containing the following statement:

"..you are only worth what the market will bear, and what someone is
willing to pay you."

Below is a lightly edited version of my response to that posting.

==========

Most successful managers know, or learn by experience, that hiring the
best people for $X pays off *much* better than hiring less than the best
for $<X.  Usually the best people are insulted by offers of $<X.  The
manager and company making the offer soon earn the reputation of being
cheap.  This is a liability in a "small town" like Portland where the
word quickly get around.

Some managers suffering from magical thinking are applying a mythical
man-month principle by thinking that hiring two for the price of one
produces twice the work.  The fallacy of this thinking was exposed more
than 25 years ago by Frederick P. Brooks in the classic "The Mythical
Man-Month."  Twenty years later, the first revised edition of this book
reaffirms the original principles.

The best people bring a wealth of experience and depth of understanding
to a job that lesser experienced people are lacking.  It's wishful
thinking that sending a lesser experienced person off to training will
close the gap.

Anyone sent off to training may return with some more experience and a
better depth of understanding.  But even this incremental improvement
doesn't come close to closing the experience gap, and the ability to
solve difficult problems.

There's no substitute for experience and depth of understanding.  Paying
the price is a bargain.  First rate managers know this.  They know that
the best people usually out performs several lesser experienced people
combined.  What a bargain!

Being a hiring manager for several years, one phenomena that ceases to
amaze me is first rate managers hire first rate people, and second rate
managers hire third rate people.

Food for thought.

Jon:

If you have a Synaptics Touchpad or ALPS GlidePad then you should look at:

http://www.compass.com/synaptics/

I believe that most Compaq Presarios use the Synaptics Touchpad, but with
laptops it's always possible that you have some oddball system.

I have an RPM SPEC file available if you want it.  Just E-mail me directly
and I'll send it to you.

I put it in my startup with the option "--tapmode=0" which disables the
"lift up your finger and bring it down again to simulate a mouse click"
option.  I don't like having to constantly press my finger down to avoid
accidently clicking where I didn't mean to.

But from what I've read (I may just have a mis-understanding) this

recommend DAO mode where (I gather) the whole load is recorded at once

Yes this is useful.  Thanks, Jeme.

So I now undertand the "raw data" part of my question.  But I still need

Good discussion, John!

Unfortunately, this is fairly true and does not invalidate the rest of
your argument.  It really is simple supply and demand.

If there are only a few top-level engineers available then a bidding war
erupts as people compete to bribe these folks out of their
positions.  Basic economics says when demand vastly exceeds the supply of
a "widget" (no, not X11... ;-) the equilibrium price will be quite high.

If the reverse is true and there are lots of top-level engineers looking
for work, there is no need for a bidding war and in fact after some months
many of these top engineers will be getting desperate and will be working
for much less than they would normally do.  Again basic econ, supply
exceeds demand and the equilibrium price will be quite low.

This defines "what the market will bear".

Now we get into the fun part "what someone is willing to pay you".

Companies generally spend lots of money to identify the above market
equilibrium prices on a semi-regular basis.  Once that is accomplished,
it's ususally up to to the hiring manager or his boss(es) to decide if
they want to pay above or below that rate based on what they presently
have and what they need.

For example, if a company is lucky enough to have several senior people
and just needs to round out their workforce, they may only offer a small
amount of money on the understanding that the first couple of people might
get shooed out after only a couple of months.

If they need to get someone in who will hit the ground running, and don't
want to deal with re-hiring later, then they should offer above that
equilibrium (market) price.

Some companies know this and will hire above market rates, hoping to find
good people.  Generally these same smart companies are vicious when it
comes to firing people who do not perform.  (If not, they'll quickly find
themselves in a bad situation-- spending lots more than they need to for
inferior people.)

Cheapskate companies looking for a deal generally have to suffer enormous
turnover and a bad reputation.  They will only find people who have been
unable to get hired or stay hired at the other companies.

I wish more people would read and believe that book.  Unfortunately, most
project managers like to apply simple division to tough projects.  This is
the same flawed logic that leads to PMs figuring if one woman can have a
baby in nine months, then nine should be able to do it in one month.

If you can find the right junior people this can actually work out-- but
it's no substitute for good mentoring from a senior person or two.

The problem is finding smart, motivated junior folks who will actually
learn.  There's no way to find this on a resume.

Yes, junior folks should be thought of as a supplement to shed "busy
work" load from the senior folks-- not as a replacement.

Fun discussion.  Maybe I should go look for that other list. ;-)

DAO: disk at once
TAO: track at once

The differences (in summary) are basically in track at once mode, you
can record multiple audio tracks at different times, so long as you
don't "fixate" the CD (although, it must be fixated to actually play in
anything).  In dao mode you have to write the entire disc at once (um,
well, yeah ;-)) How this translates into the real world:
Track at once discs have some requirements, such as the pregaps of all
the tracks are 2 seconds (spacing between songs, when you hit play on
most CD players this is the stuff that shows up as negative and counts
down to zero, when the actual track starts playing).  In dao mode, the
pregap is adjustable from 0 up to some limit I'm sure.  I missed the
first part of your question, but basically this means that for recording
live music, copying Dark Side of The Moon, etc. you don't want TAO
'cause you get breaks in between tracks which is disconcerting if there
are no breaks in the actual music.  And now on to the "HOWTO" of dao:

cdrecord will let you record in DAO mode with the -dao option, done and
done.
OR you can use cdrdao which is more complicated by a few orders of
magnitude.  It requires a config file specifying all the lengths of the
various tracks pregaps, etc.  In short, it tends to be a PITA and I much
prefer using cdrecord for doing this, even though it's not as flexible,
I don't care (I just want it to write songs with no breaks between them,
usually), and I suspect you don't either (unless you want to do silly
things like have tracks overlap, different pregaps for different tracks,
etc.  DAO can do a LOT of things if you bother to specify them in the
toc file to cdrdao).

In fact, dao mode USED to be labeled as "may be removed in the future,
don't depend on it" or some such, but it appears to be around for the
long haul as the man page now states:
       
-dao   Set  Disk  At  Once  mode.  This currently only works with MMC
drives that support non raw Session At Once mode.

I don't know about the requirements of cdrdao drives, though I suspect
they are comparable.

Again from the cdrecord man page (which will probably answer your
question in the most succinct way possible, which I obviously have not
;-)):
To copy an audio CD in the most accurate way, first run

           cdda2wav -v255 -D2,0 -B -Owav

       and then run

           cdrecord -v dev=2,0 -dao -useinfo  *.wav

(replacing -D2,0 and dev=2,0 with the appropriate device of course)
cdrdao actually has a "copy" command that will do this for you, but it
is, like I said before, just a "wee bit" more coplicated than just:
cdrdao copy <srcdevice> <destdevice>

Hope this helps,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0207121008300.18857-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I've read the men pages for loadkeys, dumpkeys and keymaps. According to
the keymaps man page, the following will swap the left control key and the
caps lock key when working on a console:

# Exchange the left Control key and the Caps Lock key on the keyboard
keycode 58 = Control
keycode 29 = Caps_Lock

  This did not work when I tried it out. Then I ran dumpkeys and learned
that that's how the keys are already defined. So, I'm missing something
here and I'd appreciate some guidance on how to effect this change.

  I've swapped the two keys in X on both my workstation and notebook by
creating a ~/.xmodmap from the examples in the man page. Works just fine.
Now I want to do the same thing, especially on the notebook. On that machine
I constantly press the caps lock key when reaching for the tab key. By
swapping the control and caps lock keys I'll both eliminate that problem and
put the control key where it's more easily reached while typing.

Thanks,

Rich

For just duplicating CD's, cdrdao is probably the best one available. 
It only reads and writes whole CD images in binary form (the images can
be mounted in a loopback device and then played) and it extracts the
TOC, stores it in a separate file, and writes it back, unchanged.  The
man page does a good job of explaining what it can do and how.  It also
has a "raw-read" option, but that is only needed for trying to duplicate
copy-protected CD's (for backup purposes only, of course).  The strange
thing is that this program obviously was designed for audio CD's, but it
works very well on data CD's too, you just ignore the TOC that it
extracts and use the binary image, which turns out to be just an ISO
image.

Why would the smptd_client_restrictions care anything about the
header?  The header is a part of the message, not the envelope
data.

The smtp client restriction is based off of the mailserver that
connects to you, its IP address, name, etc...  *Not* anything in the
header (should postfix accepts the message a new line is added to the
header based on this info).


The problem really needs to be tackled on the backup MX, not on your
box.  The only real way to filter these things is when they are being
sent by the untrusted system.  Once they reach something trusted what
is your mailserver to do?  I mean the message is coming from a trusted
SMTP source (your backup MX).  SPAM filters can *only* be applied to
the current remote system, any previous hops are just text data in the
header.

That being said, if it is impossible to fix the backup MX, look into
postfix header_checks.  You can do a rexexp against the header for the
offending system.  Not exactly a preferred method, but if the message
is already on a trusted system not much else you can do short of a
procmail filter that does the same thing.  Postfix header_checks and
body_check are the equiv of :H and :B in procmail, but done before the
message is accepted into the delivery queue.  Not something to go wild
with, text searching is expensive cpu cycle wise, but useful at times.
Less costly to do these filters on a system wide basis inside postfix
than via procmail.  (For a single user procmail is the better
filtering place though).

Yes, I have, many times.  The reasons (and fixes) are varied, some were
hardware related, some were lilo.conf related.  What is your hardware
configuration?  What is the lilo.conf that you've tried (particularly
the one to create the boot floppy)?  Does lilo spit out any errors or
warnings when you run it?

In most cases it relates to BIOS using an odd LBA or similar large
disk mapping scheme.  It can also be caused by an improperly detected
disk geometry, or manually specced geometry.


Basicly, the disk translation active when lilo does its boot mapping
and writes the MBR is substantially different than the one in use when
BIOS is doing the initial load. Sooo, the first few pages of LILO get
started, but it cannot complete the load. (Initial forst stage is
pulled from the boot loader, but when the first stage jumps to another
sector to load the second stage (the actual loader that reads in the
kernel) it end up reading the wrong location.

I answered too quickly.  Try my suggestion anyway, but be sure
to reboot or, in some way, make sure you are starting out with
the right initial condx.  If you had run loadkeys and then run dumpkeys
I would expect to see what  you saw in your third paragraph.

putting:

    XkbOptions  "ctrl:swapcaps"

in your /etc/X11/XF86Config file if you run X 3.3.x

(or if you run X 4.x.x use

    Option "XkbOptions" "ctrl:swapcaps"

in your /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 file)

will obviate (love dem $5 words) the need for the .xmodmap hokus-pokus.

It does.

If cdrdao is that easy to use maybe I'll give it a try instead of
going the cdrecord route. I'll have to build it for my system and then
read the man pages.  I just didn't want to worry about what looked
like a nit-picky config file right now.  This is a "one time job" so
I'm looking for "breezy-easy" if possible.  But I also want to learn.

I don't exactly know what MMC is myself, but the odds are your drive is
MMC (I *think* almost all newer drives are, I'm pretty sure the only
drives that aren't were some early recorders).  All of the ones I have
come across in recent years have been.

cdparanoia does *much* better error detection and correction, but I
rarely have problems with cdda2wav when forced to use it for something
(like a cd cdparanoia can't handle, and I've come across a few, don't
ask me why). The one serious drawback for cdrdao for me is that it
doesn't support burnPROOF :-( and for the newer, faster, and largely IDE
drives, it really is necessary to actually get a burn AND continue using
your computer (why aren't CDR makers making SCSI drives anymore?!?!?!

Well, um, ignore my previous reply, from the "ChangeLog" for cdrdao
1.1.5:
  * BURN Proof support added by ITOH Yasufumi/Martin Buck

The only question now is how to enable it ;-)
it looks like using cdrdao to copy a cd is as simple as:
cdrdao copy --device <bus,id,lun>

it will then prompt you to insert the CD-R after it's read the data from
the device (or you can do cdrdao copy --device <yadda> --source-device
<yadda>)

I would suggest running for a while with a WARN target rather than
REJECT on your new rule for at least a few days.  It is easy to write
to permissive a regexp.

Make sure of how you set it up, postfix (depending on config and
compile options) supports egrep style regexp as well as PCRE.

Try to write a tuned regexp,

/^Received: from drizzle\.pdxlinux\.org/

is alot lower overhead than

/drizzle\.pdxlinux\.org/

or

/^Received:.*drizzle\.pdxlinux\.org/

(bind to start or end of line and minimize drifting matches).

You can burn *alot* of CPU here, as the regexps are run against *all*
messages.  header_checks is not to bad, body_checks is an easy way to
overload the system (think drift matching against a 5MB mime64
encode...)

Hmm.  So maybe I can use cdda2wav first (to get these info files), then
delete the wav files and run cddparanoia to extract them again cleanly?

My drive is only a few months old and it's SCSI.  Sorry it and the
machine are currently running demos in our executive board room which
is filled with high-level brass from Sharp Corp. (Japan) so I don't think
it would be wise to walk in and take a look just now.

  Eureka! I had seen the first line in one of the man pages but without
explanation of what it is or the necessity of having it there. Now that I
think about it, it makes sense.

  Great advice, Dean! I put it in ~/.bash_profile so it's there in any
console or spawned terminal.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020712125402.00b9d408@localhost>

I have several solaris 8 boxes. For several reasons, they don't have Sun 
keyboards on them. They have a standard PC keyboard, hooked through a KVM, 
which then goes through a PS/2<>USB adapter. The USB cable hooks to the system.

Most keys work as expected. One that doesn't, is the pipe.

However, if I have 2.6 or 7.0 of Solaris, it works fine.

Any ideas of what keymapping I need to do to get this working?

TIA!

As far as I understand, it only needs to be done once at initial
login.  It seems to "take" in all VTs after that.

But since it is not an involution, (in particular, it's idempotent)
[Wow, _two_ $10 words in one sentence] you don't need to worry about the
side effects of calling it more than once.

[snip]

Yes, there is a secret foundry of sorts, it's called a word processor, all
I have to do is type in the following lines:

   Skills:  12 years Java/J2EE experience
            27 years MC68000 assembly

and magically I am an expert! :-)  Of course the fact that neither of
these technologies have been around for the length of time given goes
right past the hiring managers, and what's worse, often the engineering
managers miss it to.

This is why so many of the companies that use permatemps and H1B at
extremely low rates either fold or get all their money from government
contracts (the only organization I know that pays whether or not you
deliver the goods), people who are willing to work that cheap often don't
have any experience with many of the skills listed on their resumes (HTML
and Javascript skills certainly can't be what is often claimed given how
broken most web sites are).  Reports that I have seen over the last few
years indicate that resume fraud is massive these days because no one
bothers to check anything.  I guess I shouldn't be surprized, I've been
doing contract work for 14 years, and despite the fact that many companies
I have worked for require references, not once in the last 12 years has
anyone actually contacted one of my references.

Anyone need a consultant with 20 years of Linux kernel experience? :-)

Dean,

  Germane to your observation above, I also discovered that if it's loaded
when root logs in it works for us reg'lar folks, too. At least, it seemed
to.

  I wasn't sure how "sticky" it was so I went for broke.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0207121242140.19492-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  We're on a roll here today. Solved the key mapping problems in both CLI
and X, so let's try for the Big One: connecting to my ISP from my notebook
via the cell phone. The connection works just fine with the pcmcia modem and
a land line, by the way.

  Here's where I am: /etc/ppp/options, /etc/ppp/net-chat and
/etc/ppp/ppp-secrets all correct to invoke PAP upon login. When I try to
dial in using 'ifup ppp0', the connection is made up to the point of the LCP
(link control protocol) establishment; that's when the connection times out.
So, back to the PPP-HOWTO.

  Working my way through to check that I have everything correct, I get to
Chapter 17: Setting up the PPP connection manually. As root, I invoke
minicom with the phone on, configured for data/fax operation and the cable
connecting the two devices. Minicom reports that I'm online. Can't hang up.
Always online. Anyway, by entering the phone number after 'atdt ', I get the
login prompt, so I do. Few seconds later, I see the ppp gibberish and I know
that the connection's established.

  According to the HOWTO, I now exit minicom without resetting (by pressing
ctrl-a q). Do that. Then I enter the string, 'pppd -d -detach /dev/ttyS1
19200 &'. I'm supposed to see modem lights flashing, but of course there are
no such lights on the cell phone. So I just type 'ifconfig' looking to see
the ppp connection come up. It never does. Eventually the attempt times out.
According to /var/log/messages, the following (abreviated) entries are
recorded:
	send (AT ...)
	expect (OK)
	^M
	NO CARRIER
	 -- failed
	Failed (NO CARRIER)
	Connect script failed.
	Exit

  The cell phone is still on so I don't know why the carrier was dropped.

  What shall I do to try to debug this?

Thanks,

Rich

Internet Arena is dead.  The grovelling carcass that remains should
get no more sane dollars thrown at it.

So says a former inhabitant of the facility (me), after numerous
outages and route messes in the past six months, and the realization
that the racks are "manned" only 10-6 mon-fri, with NO ONE available
to even reboot a box on the weekend, and no access to customers except
during business hours.

InetArena - once a fine place, now a sewer pit.

Please stop sending business there.

  If you go to <http://www.ncftp.org> and download the binaries you can just

Looks like pppd is trying to dialup ... again.  And is your cell phone /
modem really on ttyS1?  Is minicom connecting to ttyS1?  The default for
minicom is ttyS0.
   I have sympathy for you because just went through a similar experience 
about two hours ago.  I was entering ttyS3 and the modem was on ttyS4.  

You might consider using Linuxconf.  It is the best admin and
configuration tool I've ever used. (Since I like someone else said in
another PLUG thread have 20 years experience with Linux.  :-)  Seriously I
had to use IBM's GUI for their RS 6000 AIX machines.  That was a joy ...
not!

Yeah, no redundant UPSs (or any at all for that matter), no redundant
AC, no protection from one customer flooding the network for everybody
else, no 24 hour access, no 24 staff, no nuke proof bunker, blah, blah,
blah - it's a pretty half assed operation, but they don't charge full
ass prices.  Non-lame colos that I've investigated have cost 4x-10x more
than them, and some of the similarly lame ones charge even more.

Routing problems aside, did they misrepresent their services to you
before you had a box there?

Scheduling the Space-Time Continuum with Minkowsky
By Eric Foster-Johnson

Billed as the Space/Time manager, Minkowsky uses a client-server approach to
allow group members to share and manage their schedules together. The
Minkowsky server manages the data for all users while allowing them to
access the schedule data from the Minkowsky client running on the users'
desktop PCs.

Within Minkowsky, you can schedule meetings when everyone is free, avoid
conflicts for meeting rooms, send out email invitations to meeting
participants as well as reminder messages closer to the meeting time.
Minkowsky sends email messages to the registered email address, which is
stored in the Minkowsky address book rather than the local user address
books, for each user invited to the meeting. This feature specifically
allows you to add outside participants, such as non-employees, to meetings.

The Minkowsky user interface allows you to view group schedules and see, for
example, how many meetings are going on each month (generally, too many).
The user interface seems nicely laid out and easy to follow.

The name Minkowsky comes from a play on words in German, where scheduling
software can be described as managing space/time -- as in the space-time
continuum. In physics, Minkowsky diagrams are used to display the space-time
continuum. All this makes for a memorable name and fun play on words.

Written in the Tcl scripting language with the Tix extensions as well as
addition extensions written in C++, Minkowsky should run on most Linux
systems. It does not depend on a database, instead using built-in
database-like functionality.

You can download versions for Intel and PowerPC versions of Linux from
http://itw.itworld.com/GoNow/a14724a60952a76073993a5 Minkowsky should also
work on most other versions of UNIX and a MacOS X port also is in the works.

 I had a file go into a loop and max out my HD to 100%. 
The problem now appears to be that the swap partition
is no longer functioning. I also have a new device
that is mounted /dev/shm, here is the fstab file:

LABEL=/                 /                       ext3    defaults        1 1

/dev/hda1		/mnt/hda		vfat	noauto,user,ro	0 0

When I do a df command only the /dev/hdb1 and /dev/hdb2 are displayed. 
Any ideas on what I should do?

Very Simply, tell the truth. Don't gloss it up and don't expand on it
to simply get in the door. The worst thing you can do in a small
community like Portland is to lie on your resume, get in the door and
not be able to do the job when needed.  Better to understate your
abilities and be the hero when you pull off an unlooked for miracle,
than to be the "Go to" guy in a crisis and just sit and shrug your
shoulders. Cause then they find a way to get rid of you and your good
name is tarnished forever. 

Telling the truth never hurts, but getting caught in a lie will mark
you forever, or at least for a VERY long time.

Rod,

  Yes, the modem is really /dev/ttyS1. minicom connects just fine when it's
set to the same port. FWIW, I'm using a dual-head, serial pcmcia card and
the ports are /dev/ttyS1 and /dev/ttyS2.

  Try 'top'. That'll show you the status of the swap space. Swap partitions
don't show up on df because you can't put anything there nor see what's
there.

Be prepared that along with an interview you may be given some sort of 
written exam to prove that you know what you say you know based on your 
resume. It's hard since taking an exam is alot different than how most 
people work where you have books and other resources available at your 
finger tips. 

I've seen a number of qualified candidates passed over for jobs because 
of their test score. :(

Hi,
I would advise you to take off your pink glasses and look around with
the sober eyes.
The problem with honest resumes and lieing on the interviews
is not a problem with somebody's personality. 
It's a problem with the whole system.
Everybody lies in this country salesmen,lawyers,doctors, CEO's,
politicians, church, mass media and presidents. 
It's a culture of total lie and deception.
In order to sell something you have to highlight advantages of your
product, hide its drawbacks and mix with the dirt all your
competitors. 

Telling the truth will always hurt you, the same as lieing and being
caught. 
So, keep your balance, lie smart and don't be caught. 
And you'll be OK.

Don't you think that criminals in this country are being punished not
for what they did, but because they were caught? 

Alex

When the economy is good, there is certainly hope for the honest ones,
because demand is greater than the supply.  With the current economy, I
think honest resumes don't fare as well because companies tend to only
look at the "best" resumes.  Of course, people who lie on their resumes do
get caught, sometimes companies check with past employers, some companies
make prospective employees take tests of their skills, and of course,
sometimes they will get caught after they are hired when fellow employees
find they aren't able to do the work with any degree of competence.

> And the next question, how should I benchmark my abilities so that I don't
> claim too much?

My approach is to simply list what skills I have, but no description of
the the skill level (frankly there wouldn't be room), then if they ask
about a particular skill, I can tell them about my experience in that
area, how long it lasted, what depth of knowledge I feel I have attained,
etc..  Generally, the important thing is your interviewing skills once you
get an interview (or even for pre-interview telephone conversations),
because they will probably be more important to an employer's decision
than your resume once you have made it to an interview.  Never lie or even
exagerate on a resume, if you feel the need to lie, you presumably feel
your resume is inadequate, so go learn some new skills on your own, create
a project just for the sake of learning something.  If you need more
experience, do some volunteer work (non-profits often need help with
computer skills, web sites, network setup, computer configuration, etc.),
join local groups in your area of interest and get involved, give
presentations in your area(s) of interest, etc..  All of these things can
help to make a resume more marketable, and in particular, more competitive
with the bogus resumes out there.

The problem with checking with past employers is that if they were a 
dot.con or other recently failed business there's no one left at the 
company to contact. I worked for a couple of companies over the last 
four years and I don't think either one is still around. 

I've even found that some companies I worked for 5-10 years ago have 
gone out of business or have been bought by another company and no 
longer exist under the same name they did when I worked for them. I 
don't know if that's a huge negative or not on my resume. I just put 
the name and address of the business when I worked for them when I fill 
out an employment application since I haven't followed name or address 
changes very closely of any past employer. Maybe I should...

I'm guessing your problem is with the /dev/shm mount, it is a "tmpfs" file
system.  This is used in a manner similar to /tmp or /var/tmp, except that
the tmpfs file system keeps all of the data in virtual memory (this is
very useful for swap files on virtual machines and other applications
that need fast access temp files).  So if you have any programs using the
tmpfs file system, it could easily consume all of your swap space.  Since
it is being mounted at /dev/shm, I would take a look at this directory to
see what is being stored there.  If you have the kernel sources handy, you
can read a little more about tmpfs under the Documentation/filesystems
directory.

Thank you for saying this. As someone about to be layed off because of a
merger and head count I know too well that the current economy screws the
little guy and that's in large part because so many wealthy individuals,
so many executives, so many brokers and politicians and news anchors and
analysts lied because lying made them rich. Now real lives are being
ruined. Real people are being hurt. And I didn't lie. So what did I do
wrong?

Ciao a tutti,

Simple question, probably in a FAQ or prior post, but perhaps it bears
repetition.  Are HTML pages normally compressed between the Web server
and the browser, and if so, at what level does this happen?

I'm an opponent of using tabs in source code, and the only strong
argument I've heard in support of it is that it reduces the number of
0x20 characters served in an HTML page, which may be a valid concern for
some of the indentation junkies with whom I've worked.  (You know who
you are.)  So I'm looking for an educated retort to that argument.

Thanks,

No, they are not normally compressed unless it's over an SSL (HTTPS,
encrypted) session.

I've worked with sites that reduce their bandwidth costs by stripping
whitespace from HTML on the theory that the browsers don't need it and
nobody really looks at that stuff anyhow.

I would argue that stripping those 200 bytes out of a 25,000 byte document
is pointless when they could reduce the bandwidth costs even more by
eliminating some of the extraneous images and/or javascript and/or CSS
sent along with that highly optimized HTML.

... but they didn't ask me.

  -- Steve

PS: I like to use spaces since they always contain a consistent amount of
whitespace.  Tabs often allow for things to be misaligned when some lines
are tab-indented and others are space-indented.

Exactly, that's my big qualm.  I wonder if there is an apache mod that
can strip out white space at the beginning of lines, for HTML pages. 
That would be even more effective than using tabs, and it's doubtful it
would affect the browser output.

Why would you need this to be server-side?  Why not just save the HTML and
use perl or sed to simply substitute "n" spaces for every tab character?

Since the browser doesn't care, I assume that the only thing that matters
is how it's viewable to a human.

That's not the point. The point is that in this age of corporate thievary
it would be nice if some people realized that all KINDS of people lie. Not
just hippie liberals (as Rush and Michael Savage think) and not just CEOs.
ALL stripes of people lie. But some lies are bigger than others and some
are more damaging than others.

Kinda going over the line there, Alex. It's not right to accuse someone this 
way. I know many honest people who are honest all the time. Don't know what 
circles you travel in, or what you mean by "sneaky moves." How can you be 
sneaky? A customer will find out real quick if you can deliver on your 
promises. If you can't, no more customer, and no more staying in business.

Which to me is an poor way to do it.  At my last job they handed me some 
equipment and a computer with a web browser.  What they were interested in 
was my ability to learn, operate independantly and apply what I know.  It was 
a great experience.  If I wanted to hire someone who tests well I'd interview 
MCSEs.

Why test someone on their memorization of man pages.  Put them in a empty 
cube in a reasonable work environment and give them a task to accomplish.  
This is a much better test than some exam.

Not.

The stripper (I just had to call it that :-) would have to parse the
i/o stream to know when it's sending bits that are sensitive to 
whitespace, especially

* <pre> ...  </pre> text (imagine how a python script could be 
  munged -- gives me the shivers just thinking about it)

* quoted strings in JavaScript, or any client-parsed script

* strings in forms

Honestly, if web performance hinges on the stripping of whitespace, 
then computer science is a lost, lost cause.

I'd say that the best thing you could do is find out when the PLUG resume
database is going to go live (if it has I fully missed it) and put a
realistic resume there. (It is my fond fond wish that) People searching that
database for someone are going to be able to figure out that you're a bright
guy and have it together.

No, I don't think that is true. I think a minority of people in the
catagories above lie as a matter of course but there are high profile
instances which get lots and lots of media attention.

For example, Enron, WorldComm, Global Crossing, etc., were high profile
companies that lied. That does not mean all or even most companies lie it
is just that the media is not going to tell you about the multitudes of
honest people and companies because that is not newsworthy. It is just
like it is not news to say that billions of people went about their
business today without major incident. No, the press tells you about the
flood and the scandal and the violence. This is not to say that the
business scandals don't show a need for reform because they do show such a
need.

No, if you want return customers you need to work with the customer or
potential customer to jointly figure out if the product or service is a
good match. That means you need to do an honest job of figuring that out. If the
customer feels resentful that he or she bought the wrong product or
service or bought a more expensive service when a less expensive one would
have met the need.

And yes I have had jobs with direct experience working with customers to
figure out with them what the best service was for them. They appreciated
the integrity and came back again and again and told others.

Wrong, wrong, wrong. Lying regularly may benefit you in the short run but
it will hurt you in the long run.

Perhaps it was the most proximate cause of their being punished but you
can argue just as well that the cause was because of what they did. Let's
not get into a philosophical debate about crime and punishment though.

Well we're back to the message (I already deleted your first message so 
I'll play this by ear.) that pppd is trying to dial up or at least run a 
script verses just starting up.  What distribution are you running?

There is a switch to turn on more debugging information for pppd.  Not 
sure what it is off the top of my head but you should try turning it up 
higher and watch (tail -f) the /var/log/messages file to make sure what 
you're reading in the messages file is happening as pppd is trying to 
start.

The reason that you are being laid off is because your company is not
selling enough product or service to make enough revenue to keep you on.
It is not because this person or that person lied it is how the market
works. Brutal? Yes. Unfair? Yes.

Churchhill said, "democracy is the worst form of government, except for
all the rest." The same can be said of market capitalism.

Just take a look at the eastern block countries or the former soviet union
if you want to see the devastation wrought by communism. The environmental
degradation is going to take generations to recover from if it ever
happens.

How would quoted strings be a problem?  They start with a quote, not

You mean as in a TEXTAREA?  That's probably another exception, but like

Well, Mr. Heinlein, that's a rather general declaration, but I agree
with what you're saying.  But some managers refuse to see this light. 
I'm not saying I would ever want to have to resort to the Stripper, but
if it came to that versus using tabs unilaterally, I'd have to think
about it.

I'm actually a little suprised there's no compression features in HTTP. 
Seems like the browser could request a page and indicate that it
supports a simple compression of some sort, and the server could then
compress it on its way out.  Given the amazing volume of indentation
I've seen in some (very large) pages, this could have an impact after
all.

Of course, all kinds of people lie but most people are usually honest.
Everyone tells an occasional lie usually a white lie.

Some corporations engage in thievery most do not. Most provide products
and services as best they can.

I personally try to frequent local businesses whenever I possibly can.
That is the best thing you can do as an individual. Support the local

Well, I'm not entirely sure.  All I know is I'm contracting at a company 
for less than 2/3 of what my salary used to be and I know that at the 
end of the contract I'll be tossed like a used kleenex.  They're having 
an easy time finding new people and they want to make sure they don't 
hold onto a contractor too long.

I'm not too bitter about the pay since I'm way over qualified, but I've 
seen some real good people have to leave because it was at the end of 
their contract.

Oh well, back to the mantra "Work is not my life"

I have RH 7.3 and 7.2. 7.3 is great. 

I await for Gnome 2 to attain stability. Never have liked Nautilus, it is 
supposed to be much improved.

If you're running an RH server, can't see much reason to upgrade. However for 
desktop duties 7.3 is a big improvement over 7.2. PS: avoid all gui tools but 
Webmin. Webmin does not hose config files.

Of course it's a Linux group, can't you tell by the strong opinions on every 
single little thing?  :)

I've never actually tried doing a multi-line string in JavaScript, but 
my hunch is that it's possible, just like it is in, say, Perl:

my $str = qq/
ooh

                this

     whitespace is part
  of the string
/;

And the minute you say, oh, OK, we'll make an exception for 
JavaScript, then you'll end up changing a standard Internet protocol
every time a new client-side scripting language evolves. I just don't 
think the HTTP protocol should bear the burden of defining what is and 
isn't significant whitespace.

In Textareas, yeah, and in <option value="blah">, where the value 
string could, according to the HTML spec, span lines. It's unlikely, 
granted, but a stripper could violate the integrity of a legitimate 
string.

Some clients, even old ones like Mosaic, supported some forms of
decompression on the fly, but it's certainly not part of the HTTP
protocol.  Under some circumstances, like when the client and server 
are communicating at ethernet speeds, compression can actually slow
things down.

Actually I'm running quite a few RH 7.3 systems at work.  I might load
it on one of my home machines for kicks. I run SuSe on my other machines.

Now my question is this: Has anyone else noticed that the CD images that 
are available now are different from the original release?  I did a 
quick compare and IIRC, it seemed to add some language support for 
additional languages.

I disagree completely.

First of all, it should be evident to anyone paying attention for the
latest decade that a large swath of this country was complicit in the
bubble and thus the market we're currently mired in. The magazines were
constantly touting companies, stocks and the market, without doing their
homework. Analysts were giving sell ratings stocks they wanted to unload.
TV commentators on CNBC were umping up the volume in order to get higher
ratings.

Not all lies, but certainly in MANY cases a lot of truth-stretching,
turd-polishing and snake-oil selling was going on. And in my opinion, when
the fat of billions of people is at stake, those are LIES and those
actions are immoral. Period.

Secondly, the number of BIG companies engaged in this numbers around 20, I
believe. I can't find the site that lists them all, but there are a LARGE
number of companies restating their earnings in the billions. This is
alongside hundreds of other companies declaing bankruptcy.

Now, you might say, a lot of these companies just had bad luck or a bad
idea, but they didn't lie. BS. If you (general you) take out millions or
billions of dollars in loans or VC money, knowing you'll probably never be
able to pay it back, but yet you sell sell sell to get said money (as
hundreds of now-defunct companies did) you are lying and you stealing. And
if put said companies on the IPO market and sell them to shareholders as
something they NEED to get in on when you know damn well deep inside the
IPO is just a stock-boondogle, then you are lying and you are stealing.

Hundreds of companies did this during the 90s. Involved in these deals
were thousands of lawyers and executives and stock analysts. And all of
them were selling. Which in my book, is every bit as bad as lying, if
you know what you're selling isn't worth it or may not last.

Or maybe I was the only person who spent the majority of the 90s getting 4
hours of sleep at night because I absolutely 100% knew that we were
re-living the roaring 20s and everyone else was either too unethical or
too stupid to see it.

I'm sorry, but I give these guys more credit than that. I wasn't the only
one that figured out it was a con game. A lot of "them" knew. A lot of
"them" lied. And we're all going to pay the price. Sure there are a lot of
honest people and companies out there, maybe they're the majority. That's
small comfort considering the Trillions that the liars and theives have
taken.

Yes, they are different. It seems there was some non-GPL code is some 
package or other, and Redhat had to remake the ISOs due to license 
restrictions on the code that was there. I believe I have originals... :)

At least, that's the story I was told.

The economy is interconnected. The reason there isn't enough work to be
had is because the economy is tanking. The economy is tanking because of
the liars and the criminals.

True. But there is a middle ground between communism and unfettered
capitalism without rules and regulation, isn't there?

There is a middle ground. I think. Somewhere there, though, we decided the
private sector did EVERYTHING better. So everything was privatized and
deregulated. Maybe it's okay if we retreat from that bad idea a little
bit. The govt. is often inefficient and often crooked. But it should be
apparant that an unregulated market is just as bad, if not worse.

Actually there is support for this, but it's optional and rarely used,
I used to have my server setup for it years ago, but I found that not very
many people were able to use it because their browsers didn't support it.
Check the "Accept-Encoding" HTTP header field and the "Content-Encoding"
Entity header for more info.  Also, some browsers support (or used to
support) in their default configuration, uncompressing and displaying HTML
web pages if they had the appropriate compression suffix on the file, such
as: index.html.gz which would be automatically uncompressed and displayed.
I haven't tried any of this for several years, so I don't know what is
supported by current browsers.

mod_gzip for apache...

http://www.remotecommunications.com/apache/mod_gzip/

I also don't know about browser support for this. The FAQ says HTTP 1.1
compliant browsers will accept gzipped content. Everybody else fails down
to uncompressed content.

Hi,
Thank you for remainding me to update you on PLUG resume database project.

I just finished general resume database layout.
After some research I concluded that this project should be done in fuzzy 
logic rule set algorithms. 
Otherwise there is no way to process human language expressions about level 
of expertise, experience, past and present achievements, personal attitude 
e.t.c. for database queries.
Now I'll have to write intrinsic search engine, resume loader and user 
interfaces. 
I'm sorry for a slow pace of development but physically I can't contribute to 
this project more than 3-4 hours a day after my regular job.

No, the economy has tanked because we are in a recession. Go look at your 
history, the economy has been on a boom and bust cycle. It is called the 
business cycle. The good times will come back again.

Will they be the same as the boom times of the 90s? No. They will be 
different and likely different sectors will drive it. There will be more 
tech jobs along with this boom but it is very likely that wages will 
not be as high as they were in recent years. Perhaps it will be nurses 
that will see higher wages or some other area of shortage. But yes things 
will get better in the tech sector as everything else does depend on it. 
Perhaps it will be biotech, pharmaceuticals, and medical type industries 
that really drive things in the coming years.That will mean more jobs for 
people who can develop good software solutions, databases, administer 
systems/networks, support desktops, etc., etc. Things will get better but 
perhaps not at as high a wages and not as high a demand as before.

It is possible that the tech industry could come out of all this pain 
stronger, more stable, more sustainable, and healthies than before. 
Perhaps it will be more like a table candle that burns steadily than like 
a roman candle that burns bright and goes out. Perhaps all this pain has a 
purpose as it were.

Clearly, the SEC needs to do a much, much better job of enforcing the 
laws. I think there is a consensus now that the lying and cheating is not 
acceptable.

We don't have an "unregulated market". We have plenty of regulations. In 
some areas the laws have not been enforced very effectively. That clearly 
needs to change.

The private sector does do many things better. At the same time there is 
an appropriate role for government. We have a pretty large government now 
that does many things. The suggestion that the size of government has 
shrunk substantially in recent years is not supported by the facts.

Here is my story:
I was working for two start up High Tech companies as a process engineer and 
later as a test engineer during first and the second Japanese crisis. 
One company was wafer manufacturer in Hillsboro OR , the second one is a 
circuit manufacturing foundry in Camas WA.
In both cases I had to meet with vendors on order to make conclusion and 
report for the higher management what production equipment brand we have to 
purchase for my area of manufacturing process. 
The same things did other process engineers for their areas of responsibility.
In other words our start up companies tried to get a bang for a buck.  
You can imagine how vigorously potential equipment vendors were truing to 
sell their equipment and services. 
They were lieing about technical characteristics and throughoutput of their 
products and were mixing their competitors with the dirt.
They proposed unbelievable prime service plans for their brands e.t.c.
They tried to bribe me with so called presentation dinners and so called 
business presents one of them was a brand new HP KAYAK with 21" monitor 
for my personal home usage.  I was too stupud to not accept these presents.
They were lobbying higher management up to the CEO level and bribe them as 
well but on a much higher level. 
I did research about each type of the equipment and submitted all conclusions 
based on a real information to the management for the final approval. 
Finally in both cases we purchased equipment nether the best quality nether 
for the best price.   
Because some unscurpulos vendors were more successful in lobbying and bribing 
upper management than others.
Since we bought their equipment we pretty much got into their traps.
They cheap promotional service plans magically evaporated and new plans 
they proposed added up to 30% to the capital cost of the equipment itself.
Installed and connected manufacturing equipment is not a VCR which you can 
return to a store if you dissatisfied with its quality.  
You have to live with it for the next 10-15 years being riped off by the 
vendors for the each emergency call to fix their darn thing which stopped 
working right in the middle of a process in a midnight.  
I've been through all this hell.
Next story about broken promises on stock options at my second start up 
company in Camas WA. 
I still keep its CEO e-mail with promise to go public after we reach 
profitability.  All Engineers and productions were working like dogs for 
12-14 hours a day during start up period in a good hope to get a chunk of 
wealth from the corporate pie and retire before 50.   
When we've reached targeted profitability, upper management have forgotten 
about all their promises.  Guess who got the money?
Some employees started a law suit others just left the company. 
So I did. There was even an article in Oregonian about this case.

Carla, take off your rosy glasses and lets finish this thread for good.
Amin.

Wow. And I thought my situation was unique: of all of my employers in the
last 10-13 years (ignoring consulting firms), only three are still in business
under their own name: one is Intel, where I worked as a consultant for
two months; another is Stream, where I doubt anyone could find the records
to confirm the dates that I worked there (although I could show the
scars if anyone doubted the fact), & my last employer, QualityLogic,
who have however closed their Beaverton offices & moved their corporate
headquarters somewhere out of state.

A permanent job ain't what it used to be.

For the major browser, I believe IE 4.0+ supports it (although IE 4.5
(and perhaps 5) on the Mac don't - grrr).  For IE make sure you've got
HTTP 1.1 checked on under advanced options.

Netscape 4.06+ also supports it, versions below 4.5 have buggy support
for externally referenced (rather than inline) javascript and CSS
though.

Assuming you can spare the CPU time on the web server, HTML compresses
*very* well and can help out your bandwidth challenged users.  mod_gzip
is pretty handy, it'll compress all output to the browser - CGI, PHP,
Zope, whatever, as long as the browser tells the server that it can
accept gzipped content.  mod_gzip will also cache static files so they
don't have to be continually recompressed over and over.  YMMV though,
an image intensive site won't be helped that much by compressing the
html.

My bet is on law related/security fields.  I think people that can analyze
a business setting based on the legal sides and then offer security (not
just in the secure data sense) will be the next focus.

Just a hunch...not really worth replying... :)

  Doesn't this cut to the heart of the issue with html? That is, that rather
than being solely a content markup language derived as a subset of sgml,
it's had formatting tags added to it, too. This (or so I've read) causes all
sorts of problems in terms of viewing certain pages on certain browsers.

  My understanding is that it's best to tag content but let each browser
decide on the presentation format. May be difficult to do nowadays, but is
it worth trying?

Alex,

  I don't fudge the facts to clients and prospective clients. I don't need
to. I've testimonial letters and a verifiable track record that backs up
what I tell them. I don't know how to fudge my previous record. Either I've
obtained permits for my clients or I haven't. Either the reclamation I've
designed and implemented has worked or it hasn't: the proof is on the ground
for all to see. When I've designed plans and programs the results are
readily available to anyone who wants to read them. I don't talk about
competitors at all.

> Sometimes you may have to make some sneaky moves just to stay in business.

  No. For a consultant that's fatal.

  I don't undertake work that I'm not capable of doing -- and doing well.
Don't forget that almost all the work that I do for clients ends up in a
permit application or report to a public agency (the regulator) at the
county, state or federal levels of government. If I tried to make things up
it would affect not only me but my client as well. Credibility and
reputation are everything.

Thought I'd share this story since everything seems to be OT today:

It is 3Q 2030.

You're arguing with your wife again. It seems she's missed her spending
quota again this quarter. A proud patriot, you have no problem spending
85% and sometimes 90% of your income on consumer goods, yet she can't
manage to spend even close to the 75% required by law. It's that foreign
mentality, you suppose--that's what happens when you are educated overseas
and without the benefit of a corporate sponsor. You have to remind her
that if the Internal Consumer's Service (ICS) catches her, she'll be doing
time in Philip Morris(TM) Prison like her uncle.

Oh well, hopefully a night at the town's
AOL-Time-Warner-Clear-Channel-Blockbuster(TM) Authorized Media
Distribution Center will smooth things over with her. That reminds
you--you need to have your eye- and ear-implants inspected for this
quarter again, otherwise you won't even be allowed in tonight.

You haven't attended church services for a while. Although your wife is a
devout follower of God's Customers(TM) and shops in the Church Store at
LEAST five times a quarter, you're not yet convinced that converting from
Consumers For Jesus(TM) was that sound an investment.

Your son Rick has just graduated from the local McDonalds(TM) High School.
You want him to go to Pepsi(TM) University like his sister, but he wants
to go to Coke(TM) College. Not that it matters--the permits you get at
either school are the same. Although he really wanted to attend
Stanford(TM), his corporate sponsors rejected that proposal, based on what
it might do to his credit rating.

Your youngest daughter just graduated Pepsi(TM) U. It was expensive, but
she is all set now, having received a Creative Thought Permit and a
Entrepreneurship License. On top of that she's accepted a job at Fortune
10 corporation. Of course almost everyone works for a Fortune 10 nowadays,
there being only thirty-some corporations left. It's too bad she had to
sign all those NDA's though--you'd really like to be allowed to know where
she would be living and how to get in touch with her. Ahh well, it's the
price you pay for our corporate security.

Your older daughter, after twenty quarters of employment, was finally
permitted to tell you that she is working in middle-management at AT&T. Of
course, every job in the United Corporations of America is
middle-management. The cheaper--skilled--labor is all outsourced to Those
Other Countries, whatever they are called. In ten more quarters, assuming
her credit rating remains good and she has attained Shareholder status,
she'll be allowed to talk face-to-face (no encrypted channel) with us
again!

Apparently, her five year old daughter has been grounded again, this time
for racking up a $6000 fine--singing "Happy Birthday(TM)" at a party
without a Media Distribution License. She really needs to be taught a
lesson--that as a patriotic Consumer of the UCA, she needs to respect the
rights of Shareholders and property owners. What dangerous thoughts she
has! She thinks she should be allowed to say whatever she pleases, no
matter what it does to someone else's portfolio! No one can get it through
to her that terrorist ideas like that will land her in one of those
"special" schools--and she'd be subjected to a lower quarterly limit on
all her credit cards.

Fax from your wife--she'll be late tonight. Corporate HQ has re-instated
fourteen-hour work days until the end of this quarter. It's too bad she's
not allowed to quit her job--you could get her a pretty sweet management
position any time in your department at Microsoft.

Rod,

  The switch is '-d' for debug. This is all following the instructions in
Chapter 17 of the PPP-HOWTO. I, too, was surprized about the paucity of
information generated by that option to pppd.

  When I get back from swapping an engine in my boat (anyone want to buy a
4-cylinder, Chevy short block, 140 hp marine engine?) I'll try connecting
again using 'ifup ppp0' as a user, and tailing /var/log/messages in another
vt.

  I _know_ there's a way to make this work; after all, we're working with
linux. :-)

And you guys don't want me to get started,  do ya?

BTW, I think you're ALL correct,  except for Neil,  who has some illusions
about the Real World.

I have been ripped off and lied to by every high-tech outfit I've worked for
so far, with the notable exception of  Teksystems;
 who contracted me to Emery Worldwide Airlines where I was third tier
support for a year.
I have posted in the past about Emery and their parent company's ( CNF) gray
areas, like the Auditor married to the President nepotism things,  and the
President having his own ServerLogic who they supposedly were going to use
exclusively for all contractors as they phased out the others like Tek.
Need I go on?
ETS; Einstein Technical Services,  tried to pay 0 overtime and 40hrs a week
for 80 hour weeks on the road rolling out for Pacificorp ( who had former
employees branch out and create ETS - the guy's wife still worked there too)

Having known about Labor Law n Oregon,  I didn't let them rip me off.
Nor did I let PWC ( PriceWaterhouseCoopers) pay 0 overtime when I left them-
(They ran an "overtime bank" scam on everyone...)

And so it goes.  The last full-time position I held dissolved over my
requesting they honor my W-4.
Seems the controller liked withholding more than she was allowed,  and more
than my W-4 specified.
They could have kept the money and never sent it to the IRS,  if I had
looked the other way.
I am not the kind who grovels just for a job, however,  and held my ground.
I shant go into how much lying and scamming they cooked their books with so
that the Fortune 300 who purchased them could have major tax write-offs for
three years allowed by the Code...
"We only made 784 dollars last year" at the big layoff meeting.
My ASS!

And then there's all the other folks I've met along the way who faked income
tax returns or grew pot to buy their homes, or finance their businesses...

The Big Lie is what the US has become. It is the definition of U.S.
actually.  ( Since it is also a corporation,  since 1871)

Corporations rule us,  and they are lies by their own legal definition,
"Legal Fictions" is the Statutory terminology.
Quite the contradiction in terms,  I'd say.
You have the right to life, liverty, and the pursuit of happiness,  but only
"priveledges" to drive.
I know why,  do you?
( Hint: They Lie To You )
Is it any wonder some folks call it the American "Dream"?   =)

PLUG-TALKers know what I am referring to. I have offered much factoid that
only some grasp, but nonetheless,  factoid.

Alex is only being realist- not pessimist. A desirable.trait,  in my book.

More of us need to do the same,  for things to change.
The facts are on the table,  we only need first ACKNOWLEDGE them.
Then we can hold folks accountable.
Then things get better.
There is a SHIT load of stuff going on today that have burning need to be
accounted for.

Wake up,  ye patriotic mini-van/SUV driving, US flag-flying lemmings.
Patriotism is not defined as "The blind leading the blind".

Open your eyes!  It's OK,  really!

Subject: [PLUG] Partition Magic Clone
Message-ID: <20020713143813.97309.qmail@web13801.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings Everyone,

 During this month's PLUG meeting I proposed an idea
for a Partition Magic clone. People gave a few
pointers to already existing projects that do similar
things.

 I have googled for what I could, and I am still in
the same situation that I was in, though I now have
more code to study.

 My situation is this: One of the sources of problems
that new users have when seting up Linux for the first
time is that they usually have to repartition their
Hard Drive. I, myself, had this problem.

 The actual problem is that most newbies don't know
much about partitions. It would be easy enough to
stick in a recent version of Red Hat and do an
automatic partition, but often, new users wish to keep
Windows.

 The next alternative is FIPS, that is nice for what
it does, but there are still problems with it. One can
also try GNU parted, but after trying it, it's not
that easy for a newbie (I found it 'easy enough' for
my own use).

 The other option is Partition Magic. Partition Magic
is quite a piece of software. It can do all the MS
type partitions and Linux partitions. It has an
excelent user interface, and even the text version it
pretty good. But it's proprietary. And I'm sick of
wondering "How do they do that?!", and having a(n)
EULA thrown into my face.

 GNU Parted is close to what I was thinking: You pop
in a disk and boot it. The thing starts up and you can
do your work. But the user interface isn't that good
for newbies and it doesn't have support for all the
file systems that PartMag does.

 So basicly, I want to make a PartMag clone, with the
exception that it will be *slightly* different, in a
better way. I don't know how yet, but that's the plan.

 Anyway I need hackers, coders, testers, and any other
form of help. If anyone can help, it would be
appreciated. If anyone knows of some other program,
tool, or other source of information, please tell me
about it.

That's about it. Thanks in advance.

Sincerely,
Vincent Damewood

When it was a local operation run by a local guy with knowledge,
it was a good place.  Yeah, it was a bit cheap, but you knew it.
At least there was someone who understood routing protocols and
how to type commands at a Linux console that you could talk to,
usually 18 hours a day, and on call the last 6.

Then, he sold the company to a canadian ISP-gobbler, and took his cash
and ran.  I don't blame him for that, but yes, the conditions under
which my box was there completely changed, without an appropriate
change in price.  Hence, we got the hell outtta there.

I'm now at sprocketdata.com, with basically the same price as I was
paying at Inetarena, but back to the same levels of service (or better)
as the "old" Inetarena.

Typical exchange.  I decide on friday afternoon at 5:45pm *their*
time, that I want to install a new box, spelling out the
configuration.  I get email within 20 minutes saying it'll be ready
monday morning, and is that soon enough?

These guys rock.  The only downside is that they're in texas, so I'm
not likely to ever touch the box running stonehenge.com.  Who cares? :)

*sigh*

That's my point...

The boom, was a lie. The boom never should have happened. Some of us (and
once again I know I'm in the minority on this one) prefer steady slow
growth to these gold rushes. I know the gold rushes happen, but it's up to
ethical adults in this world to ensure that these gold rushes don't cause
speculative bubbles.

I would have rather there never was a tech boom as it took place. I was
cheering for the market to take a dip since 1997.

Because we'll be lucky if we get out of this without sinking into another
depression.

So what good did the boom do, other than to help the rich justify widening
the salary gap from 40 times the average work to 450 times the average
worker?

Oh good, I'm glad we finally cleared that up as a society. I thought it

That means *essentially* that we have no regulation, doesn't it. I mean,
if you pass laws, but then spend more time sending pot-smokers to jail
than busting corporate criminals who steal billions, do you really
actually have regulations?

> The private sector does do many things better. At the same time there is

Like stealing money, for one. They're much more efficient at that.
Especially when you consider that the govt. can't move American
manufacturing jobs overseas. Only the private sector can give us that
special version of capitalism. Save the consumer $1, make yourself an
extra $200 million and pay some poor sap in Pakistan a nickle better than
the locally-owned sweatshop will pay. Everone wins!!!
Yeeeehhaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!

You didn't do anything wrong. You did what was right.

Regardless of what others may say, I want to tell the truth and be
known for being honest, than to make $100,000 a year by lying. 

If we allow ourselves to lie because others do it, then we promote
that lying is okay. Is this what you teach your children?

The first step of a journey begins by placing one foot in front of
another. If you want the world to be better, then start by making your
part of it better. No matter how small a step it is, it is a step in
the right direction. 

and now, back to more on topic  thoughts.

Check the permissions on usr/bin/cdrecord, most likely wants you to run it as 
root. See the Gcombust FAQ for why: 
http://www.abo.fi/~jmunsin/gcombust/FAQ.shtml

It gives a non-root workaround which entails creating a new group & user.

I agree. This discussion should be moved to plug-talk. It's not even 
remotely on topic.

BTW, plug-talk has been REALLY quiet lately, so this discussion won't be 
competing AT ALL for any bandwidth over there.

Thanks for thinking about it.

You make some good points, Paul.  But let's remember we're talking about
two different solutions.  One is a server plugin that actual strips the
HTML on the way out (obviously an ugly idea, as you argue, but an idea
still); and the other is lossless compression between the server and
client, and that's where HTTP would come in.

You know the big corporations do not just run on air, they are fueled 
daily by the spending decisions of millions. It is funny, by far the 
biggest complainers about corporate America I know are by far the most 
full of shit about the issue.

They could not possibly support corporate America any more than they do:

They live in Beaverton or some other suburb, must drive absolutely 
everywhere (even to do some simple errand), subscribe to 
cable television and Internet, shop at large chain store shopping centers, 
spend much or possibly most of their disposable income on a multitude of 
consumer products especially various tech gadgets made by large 
corporations. Oh, and I almost forgot, have shelves and refridgerators 
full of processed food (grown by corporate farms and processed by 
corporate food processors). For a night out: Outback Steakhouse or one of 
the other suburbun chain restaurants. There lives could not be more tuned 
to supporting and growing the size of major corporations. From the 
corporations point of view they are the perfect consumers and supporters 
of their power.

And then have the gaul to complain about how corporations run everything, 
blah, blah, blah.

It is relatively easy to make spending and lifestyle decisions that 
support your small businesses and local organic farmers and lessen your 
support of the large corporations and corporate farms.

There are a lot of people that do a way better job than me at this 
philosophy but I am working on it. I buy fresh unprocessed food and 
vegetables either from New Seasons Market (locally owned) or from 
Organicstoyou.org (locally owned). Both outfits try to buy locally 
whenever possible and support the small farmer. I try to avoid processed 
food whever possible. Believe it or not this sort of approach takes very 
little extra effort. New Seasons is convenient and organicstoyou delivers 
a box of vegetables each week (no more expensive than store bought). There 
are other good methods such as Saturday Market and others. And fresh 
food is way, way, way better tasting. Places like New Seasons also try to 
follow the same philosophy with things like meat and fish, etc.

I minimize commercial television partially because 99% of shows suck but 
also because I don't want to see commercials. Television commercials are 
toxic. I do watch a couple sitcoms that I like and I watch the new Star 
Trek (Enterprise) but I limit it to that. Other television is through OPB 
which is public broadcasting (channel 10). I don't have cable. For radio I 
stick to the public radio with occasional forays into AM talk.

For Internet I go with Pacifier, who briefly was owned by an ISP grabber, 
but now is back in local hands (Doug Palin again).

When I want to go out to eat I always go to a locally owned restaurant, 
which are almost always better than the chains.

I recently discovered a locally owned greeting card store that is very 
cool. Many of the cards are made by local (Portland and Seattle) artists 
and make Hallmark cars look trite and stupid.

Granted things like books, movies, clothing, etc., are almost always made 
by large corporations; that does not mean you have to buy them from 
corporate outlets.

As I said, I am a mere novice on this path. For example, I drive a car 
(corporate produced) that burns fuel (corporate produced).

My point is that each of us votes with our dollars every day. WE are the 
problem not some distant corporations. They don't just magically appear 
and become powerful. They become powerful because you give them your 
dollars. Why do people in small towns vote -- with their dollars -- for 
Wallmart instead of supporting Main Street? They are in effect voting for 
Wallmart. They have chosen cheaper over having a viable downtown business 
commmunity and keeping the profits local.

I believe in freedom and I believe that you need to vote with every action 
you take. We have used this freedom to create what you see today and where 
you think things are going in the future. And I believe in America and 
what it stands for and its potential. But it is you not them. There is no 
them.

This encapsulates the most important point. Everyone complains and thinks 
there needs to be some big, dramatic change. Meanwhile they are neglecting 
to do even the little bit they could do to make the world better for those 
closest to them and around them.

Who is "everyone", though? If by everyone you mean me, then you you
couldn't be more wrong. I'm well aware of the problems this world faces.
I'm a vegetarian, I'm childfree, I cycle or skateboard to work everyday
and I purposely live close to light rail so I don't need to use a car. I
shop at New Seasons more often than not and I eat lunch every day at Rice
Junkies or Big Town Hero. And I don't watch television really (except for
watching the Tour de France right now). I do my part to help the local
economy and small business, but let's be realistic.

Who made the computer you're typing on? Did you make it? Was it made in
Portland? Every part of it? This world is going to require some
compromises, even if you're trying to be part of the solution. That
doesn't mean you have forfeited your right to complain about corporate
greed and corporate control.

Aso!  This is what I was after.  Thank you Dealy, Young and Rieck.  I
posted my question to the local Java list as well, and there it swiftly
drifted off to the ol' tabs vs. spaces war. . . .

The mod_gzip site claims "all modern browsers released since early 1999"
are able to uncompress content, which I'll take with a grain of salt.
But as processors get faster, I don't see why this wouldn't become more
ubiquitous.  After all, everyone wants their pages to load quickly, and
HTML ought to compress well.

Oh, and I forgot to add that part of the reason I'm pissed about this
economy is that I'm doing my part for my family. I may live in
Beaverton (which in and of itself is evil for some reason), but I
when I bought my house here on the light rail, part of my plan was
to help my brother get on their feet. Now both of them, 21 and 24,
live with my wife and I and we rent to them for cheap and help them
out with money to try to get them on their feet. Does that count as
helping, since we're helping to make two more people self-sufficient, or
does it count as hurting since we live in the evil that is Beaverton?

I also send money to my parents when I can, but often it's in the form
of a gift certificate to no-longer-locally-owned Fred Meyer. That makes me
part of the problem, I suppose.

Beaverton is not evil in and of itself. I was merely mentioning some 
people I know who complain about corporate this and corporate that, while 
living what appears to be a 100% corporation supporting lifestyle. My 
point was not to dis Beaverton.

Not true. As I mentioned it is impossible to survive without some 
supporting of corporations. Also, it is worth mentioning that not all 
corporations are bad. I would say the majority of them are not bad.

The problem is not with supporting corporations per se. To me the problem 
is the excessive supporting of corporations at the expense of local 
businesses and farms, and viable local community.

Let's face it, economies of scale make it necessary for some things to be 
produced by large corporations. That to me is not an inherent evil.

I kind of recall two gotchas when I set up ppp for debugging:

1) syslog must be set to log messages sent at the
"debug" level.  I.e. in /etc/syslog.conf "*.debug /var/log/debug".

2) The ppp kernel module has a debug option as well.  I think that this
was done using the "kdebug 4" option.  Most of the real useful info comes
from it.

This is two to three year old info, so things might be a bit different
now.

What do you consider to be 'mannerly' portscanning? Scanning all kinds of 
sites is good education and practice, but I'm leery of being an annoyance. Or 
worse, suspected of nefarious activities.

I wouldn't suggest it. Back when I was 15 (21 now) I did that to some 
NASA servers, they sent a formal complaint to my ISP and I got the axe.

What do you want to learn? Why do you need practise?

I assume you've just compiled nmap :)

I've been using it for quite awhile, I run mixed Linux/Windows networks. All 
ace sysadmins need nmap, Ethereal, and Snort. (AFAIK, Snort is the only one 
that recognizes most nmap scans) I don't see much variety, as my customers 
are small, and pretty much the same setups. I want to see what it looks like 
scanning different hosts. You know, be an educated, experienced sysadmin. Not 
a dweeby, limited sysadmin.

Give me a scan,

orbital.us

Ethereal is ok if you're running X.
tcpdump for console :)

If you're bored and haven't checked out Nessus (www.nessus.org), check 
it out... you can run it on me if you'd like as well.

Message-ID: <NMEPJGMCLGBMCOCPJFHKCEELDLAA.kens@cad2cam.com>

Well now that I have a 36.1 gigabyte 10,000 hard drive.  I have a problem.

I have been running <shudder>Windows 2000</shudder> on my main mail reader,
photo editor, bigger memory PII 266 Mhz with 384 MB RAM system, with a
mother board that has on-board SCSI to which is connected a scanner and zip
drive. I have also sort of retired my use-to-be firewall web server
<cheer>Linux</cheer> system back from the firewall, since I obtained a
D-Link 707 Firewall/switch.

I have not formatted it yet and am wondering what would be the best file
system to use.  I want to use the hard drive as a back up for my other
systems. (Did I mention, the spouse's <shudder>Windows 98</shudder> PIII 1.2
MHz 512MB RAM, 20 GB Hard drive system?)  One of these days I will get up
the nerve and try to get to just Linux at home, but until then, I will be
putting this new drive on the <shudder>Windows 2000</shudder> machine.

Poor man. Winderz has that effect on a lot of people.

Use NTFS for security, which means more admin chores, such as setting 
permissions and having user accounts, use FAT16 or 32 for easy. Files will be 
magically translated for the different machines as they travel over the 
network.

Ken,


If it's just going to be a backup system then the choice is not
important.

I'd just stick with ext2 - well supported, mature and you shouldn't
care about fsck's.

If you do care about fsck's and want a journaling system then I
recommend reiserfs.  I've been using it for quite a while with 0
problems.

I don't have much opinion on which FS to use, but I have some 
suggestions on the migration path.

My wife used to be a windows user and what I did was migrate her to 
using Netscape for browsing and mail, and Star Office for most 
everything else.  After a while, I switched the OS to Linux and 
everything was fine.  Out of the several systems now, I only have a 
PII-266 that has Win98SE for doing Scanning. (I had an off by one error 
on model numbers when picking up my scanner.)

If you're running snort and/or other forms of intrusion detection, it
can be very informative to portscan hosts from which you've received
scans or compromise attempts.

You will then also have the opportunity to provide the owner of the
compromised system with useful information, such as "you have an ssh
daemon backdoor listening on tcp port 54321", should you care to inform
them.

If RMS where coming to OSU to give a talk about Free Software, would any
of you feel like making a small donation to the OSU ACM chapter?

Basically, RMS has agreed to come to OSU some time and give a talk if the
we pay his travel expenses.  I've done a tiny bit of searching and I
estimate the travel costs will be about $600.  Not that much really, the
CS dept here is willing to pitch in $100-$200 and the ACM has to find the
rest in couches and such.  Our goal is to come up with $450 by fall term.

Of course, when he comes anyone will be welcome including pluggers,
especially pluggers.

This email is less about getting people to commit and more about asking
people how much they would be willing to donate.

Feel free to reply to me directly.

Thanks,
Jason

PS Anyone know how to get Linus to give a talk?

How many people can attend? If there's room for 100, then $10 each means RMS 
can also be fed & housed decently, and take care of incidentals. It always 
costs more than you think, and I think it would be good to treat him as well 
as possible. Like, no sleeping on someone's couch, or living on McNuggets.

Personally, I can afford up to $25 to hear him speak.

Cool, an alternative sponsor for RMS! Excellent. I actually emailed him 
about speaking at a PLUG meeting and he said yes as long as you change 
your name to Portland GNU User's Group. Until we change our name he 
insisted that there needed to be *another* sponsor and you have stepped 
up. Here is what I learned from talking to RMS:

1. He requires only an airline ticket and, presumably care and feeding 
when he gets here (e.g., meals).

2. He does not require a hotel room. He said he would be just as happy to 
sleep on someone's couch or whatever. In fact, I think he would be happier 
in a private home than in a hotel.

3. He loves email and would prefer access to an Internet connection for 
his laptop so he can do email. Duh!

4. He likes Chinese food.

So, essentially, you just need the cost of the ticket plus and, I think, 
whatever it would cost to feed him while he is here.

---

I also talked to Eric S. Raymond. He has more or less the same 
requirements as RMS -- the cost of a plane ticket and food. His additional 
requirement is that he says that if the flight is over 5 hours or 
something like that, it needs to be business class. I am not sure if that 
is negotiable or not.

---

As for Linus I had a go between talk to him in person and he did express 
interest in coming here but that did not get any further than that. I 
could talk to this go between and try to get a more firm commitment. I am 
not sure the cost factors for having Linus up here. My general impression 
is that he less interested in speaking than either RMS or ESR; in fact, I 
got the impression that he does except such engagements from time to time 
but not necessarely enthusiastically. If we could bill it as less of a 
formal talk and more of light social hour type thing with beer, etc., then 
perhaps he would feel more comfortable. What do you think? A barbecue? A 
party? What?

Correction, our name would have to have GNU/Linux in it instead of just 
Linux. But, again, with you as the sponsor he will come.

BTW, OSDL did express some interest in sponsoring Linus coming up here. 
That could be a source of possible funding for this.

You know what, I think it would be helpful to meet face-to-face with OSDL 
leadership to move forward on that if possible.

I humbly offer my deck/backyard/bbq/costco burgers if Linus were to come and
speak. I'd be more than happy to do my part. I don't know a lot about beer,
so I'd need someone else to head up the "free as in beer" department.

(I can't code, I have to make up for it somehow! You want cheese on that
burger?)

Get permission first for every IP address you wish to scan, otherwise you
are just asking for trouble.  Many systems run automated detection systems
which report scans to the originating ISP, and for most ISP's this can
result in immediate cancellation of your account.  I get regular log
reports from my firewall, and I report anything which does not appear to
be a typical virus based scan to the originating ISP, and request that
they take the appropriate action.

Just be sure to not invite RMS and ESR on the same day.  They were
both on Linux Lunacy (www.geekcruises.com), and it was interesting

that that if either were invited to an event here, the other would
necessarily decline.

I am currently running a system with CVS and everytime I commit a file

executable.  Is this a problem on my end?  What do I do to fix it?

The way I fix this is to change the permissions inside the repository
itself.  I.e. "cd /cvsroot/path/to/your/file; chmod uog+x file"

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0207141209550.18299-100000@tpol.peak.org>

I'm looking to download or build a bootable linux-on-cdrom that I can
use from insecure machines to connect securely to my home network.

Scenario: I'm visiting a public library where there are random
public-access machines that may not be well maintained.  Or I work in
a large company where unknown people have access to my cubicle.  I
want to use their machines, however insecure they are, to connect to
my network without compromising its security.

I think the solution is a bootable CD-ROM that contains enough of a
Linux distro to boot any machine and get the network up.  It'd also
contain the latest OpenSSH client, and an account for me with private
keys whose public counterparts I'd installed in the authorized_keys
files where I wanted to connect.  Ideally, the private keys would be
in an encrypted filesystem so that even if someone stole the CD-ROM
he'd not be able to read them.

It'd also be nice, though not essential, to be able to run X (with
servers for lots of video cards) so that I could xhost Mozilla, and to
have part of the CD-ROM mountable from Windoze and include a boot
floppy image and rawrite2 so that I could deal with machines that
don't boot from CD-ROM.

If I did this right, I *think* you'd need to install a hardware
keysniffer to figure out what I was doing -- even if you'd had access
to the CD-ROM.

Is there something close to this out there already?  If not, where
would you suggest I look for the parts from which to assemble it.  Can
anybody suggest an alternative way of solving the underlying problem
of connecting from an untrusted machine?

Thanks,

--Eric House

I just found Keeper Linux and I'm in the process of downloading it to test
it out.  It sounds like what you're looking for:

http://keeper.org.uk/

It's also small enough to fit on one of those Pocket CD-R's that hold
185MB and play in any CD-ROM drive.  So you could keep a Linux distro in
your wallet.

The file within the repository IS executable, unless I misunderstand
what you mean.

Then you may have either:

1) A local "umask" setting that prevents the files from being created
executable
2) An existing copy of the file with unusual permissions set.  CVS
generally does not set permissions on files that already exist.

I need some guidance on using plugger, the browser plugin manager:

How do I call plugger within my browser? I have plugger installed, and my
/etc/pluggerc file is set up, but I don't know how to get my browser to
run plugger when it is needed. Has anyone used plugger before?

I tried entering a MIME type for image/tiff in my browser with
plugger-4.0 as the Helper but this doesn't seem to work... Any ideas?


Offtopic: The USPTO requires browsers with tiff plugins for viewing its
patent database:

"Their site structure makes viewing and printing of large patents
difficult, because pages of a given patent are not connected as a
document.  We have also offered to help solve that issue and make the site
easier for everyone to use.  Their continued use of this website design
may be related to the fact that they charge fees for hard copies of

I tried this again using plugger.so instead of the binary; but in
both cases plugger loads but doesn't do anything. Can someone spot check

Nope.  The umask is set to 002 which according to umask -S is:

u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx

So, unless I misunderstand umask, and I probably do, that is what it
should be.

I installed netscape and plugger seemed to work okay in this browser; the
problem's solved for the time being. :)

Hi Tyler,

Pretty quiet around here. My two cents would have been to use Netscape. V6 is 
very nice. It's the easiest way to get plugins working in Linux.

But since you figured it out I guess I'll not say anything.

One thing I've been wondering about for several weeks is how to upgrade to
Mozilla 1.0 using apt. 'apt-cache show' indicates the mozilla version
available from my sources.list is: 0.9.9. Does this just mean there isn't
a debian package for Mozilla 1.0 yet? I tried downloading a .deb file for
mozilla 1.0 but when I installed it, conflicts arose with the other
browsers on my system, like galeon and skipstone.

Is there a special sources.list entry I can use to cleanly upgrade
to mozilla 1.0?

I don't know what is in your sources.list file but if they're not there, try 
adding some of the following.

Long as it's so quiet. . . .

Plugger is a little irksome.  One thing I had to do to get it working
with Moz 1.0 is save the config' as /etc/pluggerrc-4.0, instead of
/etc/pluggerrc.  Easy to miss, since it's just pluggerrc in the archive.

Once you have the files copied correctly, you should see some change,
provided there isn't another plugin installed for the file you're trying
to view.  It'll either work, or you'll see a message somewhere in Moz's
interface.

And if you install plugger and then try to change the config' file
you'll run into another problem.  Moz' caches each plugin's supported
MIME/extensions and won't requery them--as if there were no such thing
as a configurable browser plugin.  So you have to remove plugger.so from
your plugins directory, restart Mozilla, replace plugger.so, then
restart Mozilla again to get it to update.  Icky!  There's also a file
you can delete, which is easier but may cause you other problems.

Also, if you're trying to view a file that is being served with the
wrong MIME (i.e., text/html for an MPEG), it won't work.  Technically
it's an error in the Web site, but you should be able to activate
plugger based on extensions alone, since this is a common idiocy.  If
anyone knows how to get around this, please let me know.

On AOL, there is such a thing as a Group... Groups at AOL (groups.aol.com)
... if you mean that (which I don't think you do) you should be able to
chat via the chat interface.  I don't know about using the links... so
you might want to IM somebody and ask them to invite you to the chat. 
They work like regular AIM chats but are different... unlike regular AIM
chats (or regular AOL Private Rooms) they link together to a special
kind of AOL Private Chat, as well as having the AIM interface.

If you mean to ask if you can chat in a regular AOL Chat room (in a
community) you *do* need the client.  AOL 2.5 and 3.0 work well with
WinE, 4.0 works for some people, and 5.0+ tend to not work worth crap. 
And you would need an AOL account ($15/month for TCP/IP access).  You
can run Win9x inside vmware or Win4Lin.  AOL refuses to release their
very-nearly-done Linux client (which they ship through their Gateway Net
Appliances).

Let me know if you need more information!

Hi All Guys

I shall experiment setting up a Database server, MySQL, serving about 10 
clients (workstations) for searching, retrieving and saving files to the 
server, not many graphic files.  I have following questions expecting to be 
advised:

OS  RH7.3

1) Partition size/allotment.  Total size of the hard disc  20G
- OS + application = ? %
- root = ? %
- users = ? %
etc.

2) Can I create such partitions at start of installation and the relevant 
files/folders will be created/saved to relevant partition during installation

3) MySQL and SQL comparison.  Which ranks on top and reasons ?  Any other 
suggestion ?

4) Anything not covered in this posting.

Thanks in advance.

Dennis;

I suspect (as you imply) that your MBR is corrupt.

By the way, do you happen to have a hard drive that has it's BIOS
information written on the disk itself? Just something to consider.

The easiest way to solve this problem is to low-level format the drive
through the BIOS. Many BIOSes (in fact most) do not have low-level
formatters so do not be surprised if this is the case for you.

Barring that, the next solution is to boot from CD-ROM and execute the
following:

dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/hda bs=1024

/dev/hda, of course, refers to the primary IDE chain (Drive C:).

The above command completely writes null characters to your entire
drive. It will take some time. There will be no output.

Install Linux on your fresh drive.

Best,


Cooper

Subject: [PLUG] Group Meeting Minutes
Message-ID: <1026750604.11499.29.camel@pookie>

All;

Here are the minutes from our last LUG meeting:

    1) The general consensus was to hold off incorporating ourselves as
a legal non-profit organization primarily because of the tax-exemption
issue. It was felt that we can continue to unofficially accept donations
for the group.

    2) We need to find a new location for our LUG meeting. This is
because Casco runs a critical 7x24 call center. It is imperative that
they keep after-hours activity to a minimum. Definitely understandable. 
No need to panic; several (including myself) are willing to host the
meetings at our homes. Thanks for your support!

     I suggested asking L.B.C.C. but it some indicated that it would be
best to keep the meeting location in Corvallis. Having the meetings in a
University classroom or presentation hall would be ideal. I do not have
contacts at Oregon State so it may take a bit for me to make
arrangements.

    I will keep you posted on our progress as well as the new location
for our meetings. If any of you know an OSU staff member with whom I
could speak with, do not hesitate to contact me directly.

    I would like to take this opportunity to thank P.E.A.K for all of
their support for our group over the past four years. They really went
the extra mile for us. Thank you.

    3) There was some discussion about moving the LUG meetings to a new
time. The group decided to hold the next meeting as usual for
consistency but at the same time discuss a new meeting time. We will
have the next meeting on the first Saturday of August. I  would greatly
appreciate your feedback on this. I am totally neutral on this one;
whatever is most convenient for you!

I will have the meeting notes up for you ASAP. Dean's work schedule is
in full swing right now so we may not get to it right away. We'll do our
best.

Finally, I have an open slot for a speaker for the first week of August.
If you have something that you would like to present, let me know.


Very Truly Yours,

Poor man. Winderz has that effect on a lot of people.

Use NTFS for security, which means more admin chores, such as setting 
permissions and having user accounts, use FAT16 or 32 for easy. Files will be 
magically translated for the different machines as they travel over the 
network.

All;

I have co-located hosted my MetaSource sight at Kattare based in
Corvallis. I must tell you that I have been very happy with the results.

Nathan is very knowledgeable and helpful. Most of all from a business
standpoint, I have had zero downtime with his services.

After an initial setup fee (not much) I believe it is $10.00 p/Gig of
bandwidth. Please do not quote me on this but it is not very expensive. 

What I enjoy most about the service is the ability to view statistics on
a daily basis. Kattare uses Webalizer to break down the access to your
sight by total bandwidth, which links were accessed, and the referring
page.

Bar graphs show you how your sight is doing.

I have better things to do than worry about my web sight!


-Cooper

There is no compression on the HTTP data stream.

I however will take the other side of the argument (isn't free speech a
great thing...) regarding usage of white space.

The ratio of tabs to TOTAL bytes transmitted is trivial and therefore
not worth the loss of readabily of the HTML compared to the
bytes-transmitted savings.  I don't have hard numbers available but I'm
estimating it's well less than 1% of the total bytes transmitted.   For
dynamically generated HTML (which is now most of the real content out on
the web) I doubt it contains much white space.  I certainly don't put
any in my HTML generation code.  Does anyone else?

Keep in mind that it's not the HTML that causes links to slow down, but
rather the graphics.    Graphics are compressed depending on the format,
but that's another topic.

This would not be hard to measure, we could simply process some web site
logs to get a reasonably accurate ratio of HTLM ascii text to graphics
bytes, them make an estimate as to the average number of tab characters
in a typical HTML page.  But them we'd have to factor out the
dynamically generated content that doesn't generate 'readable' HTML,
then I'd have to really struggle to see why I should worry about the
trivally small amount of residual quantity of bytes that could be saved.

For what it's worth, ... my $.02.

For my part,  blaming is not the object.

Recognizing problems honestly,  however,  is the first step towards fixing
it. True?

Everyone,

Just a quick reminder.  If you post a message to the list, and it 
doesn't get posted (nearly) immediately, you might check to make sure 
that the address from which you sent the message is subscribed to the 
list.  Remember: the list is now configured to hold non-subscribed posts 
until an administrator gets around to checking them out and either 
approving or rejecting them.

If your message didn't get sent, it's a good possibility that the email 
address in your from: header wasn't on the subscribed list.

If you want to post from multiple addresses, you can do one of two 
things:  Subscribe all of the addresses you want, and select the 'no 
mail' option on your preferences page.  Or email ME with a list of 
addresses you use and I'll add them to an approved posters list.

That's about it for now.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

-R

  Postfix defers mailling a message if it cannot find the routing right away
or cannot reach the recipient's mail server. As soon as the path is clear it
automatically sends the deferred messages.

  Shortly after I installed postfix here my ISP's dns servers went down for
a while. I _thought_ I was sending messages, but they were stacked in the
queue. As soon as the dns server was once again available all the messages
went out.

Deferred messages are queued messages that haven't been delivered, and have 
encountered an error. I look through the deferred messages occasionally, 
and run a utility that tells me (among other things) where deferred 
messages are bound for. Almost exclusively, they're bounces to spam 
generators about a refused message. I recently removed several users from 
my system. Evidently, they were getting large amounts of spam. Now that 
they aren't on my system anymore, the message bounces. Postfix will attempt 
to deliver the bounce for 5 days (default) and delete it after that.

Looks fairly normal, at least in my experience. I've had up to 450 deferred 
messages in the queue. They go away eventually. Unfortunately, they are 
usually replaced by others, stuck in the queue by stupid spammers.

What I'd like to see is a utility that identified spam (like spamassassin) 
and then sends a "no such user" bounce. Maybe spamassassin does this and I 
just haven't found the relevant instructions.

My deck/yard probably isn't big enough, but I do have an excellent grill and
would love to chip in on something like that.  :)  (How cool... have Linus
up for a big BBQ/beer party!).

If something like that arises, and additional cooking surfaces are needed,

It's a Traeger (hand-built in Mt. Angel) wood-pellet grill.  (Texas
version.)  I'd be more than happy to haul it someplace for an event like
that.

BTW, in emacs you could use a macro like this:

Posistion the cursor on the first line:
C-x (

C-x )
C-u num C-x e

Where num is the number of lines-1.

There are better ways I'm sure, but for a nice pedestrian approach it
works for me :)

For those curious, the C-x e runs the last macro and C-x ( and C-x ) mark
the beginning and end of a macro.

Subject: [PLUG] Redhat 7.3.92 so far...
Message-ID: <1026757496.9548.55.camel@summanulla.clueserver.org>

Well, I downloaded the latest version of the Redhat beta.

There are some good things and not so good things.

It installs very well on my Vaio with NO additional kernel options. 
This is a good thing. It is one of the only distributions that will do
that correctly.  (I won't comment what it took to get Gentoo on it. 
Lets just say it involved ritual sacrifice and the blood of the living.)

The graphical distribution hosed up.  There is an error in the script
somewhere.  The text option worked fine.  (I use text mode anyways. Much
easier to read on my laptop screen.)  The graphic mode install looks
much better than previous versions.  They are going away from the
horrible icons for packages.

The install went smoothly.  There was no glitches.  Took about an hour.
Mandrake on the same machine would tend to choke on later discs for some
odd reason.  Maybe a French thing...

The distribution defaults to the Gnome 2.0 desktop.  it is not quite as
full featured as the old desktop, but works smoother.  I cannot find how
to change Window managers within Gnome2, however.  It uses Metacity for
its themes, but the theme changer is set for Sawfish.  This is a royal
pain.  (The default theme is OK, but reminds me too much of XP.)  There
are few, if any, themes for Metacity yet.  http://themes.freshmeat.net
does not have any themes for it yet.

Redhat is moving towards multi-language support for the shell as well. 
This causes some off problems. Not all of the language information gets
set up correctly and directory listings can become strange.  (But only
for the "color" directory listings and man pages that have formatted
text.) Going in and setting the country codes and locales seems to fix
it.

KDE uses 3.0.2 from cvs.  Works pretty well. My only complaint is that
the menues do not contain any of the Gnome entries or the switchdesk
app.  (KDE seems to think that once you use KDE, you will not want to
leave. It is a little too controlling for my tastes.)  The KDE themes
are pretty sparse.  There are lots of KDE apps however.  (You will want
to run KDE once to get the environment configured if you use Gnome.
Otherwise KDE apps tend to core.)  "switchdesk" will allow you to switch
back.

The kernel is INCREDIBLY full featured.  The low latency patches are
installed.  There are patches for crypto hardware, foreign binaries
(like BSD and COFF format), and a whole lot of other stuff.  My prism2
wireless card did not work out of the box.  (Not a big concern for me as
I needed to install hacked drivers for it anyways.) The kernel souce is
already preconfigured in a way that it will not overlay the default
kernel. (The kernel is 2.4.18-5.58. Any kernel you compile identifies as
2.4.18-5.58custom.)  My only complaint is that they are not including
the FreeSWAN and Crypto patches.  I will be testing if they will patch
cleanly soon.  The kernel does work with the current wireless-ng
drivers.  (Compiled from source.)

The compiler is GCC 3.1.  So far, it has worked very well. No problems
yet...

The system uses Grub for a boot loaded.  If you use the text install it
will give you an option for "lilo". DO NOT TAKE IT!  Your system will
try and boot using Grub no matter what.  It will fail at this point.  I
prefer lilo.  Grub's method of configuration is a little too weird for
me.  Maybe it is what I am used to...

This version uses Apache 2.0.x, instead of 1.3.  I have done next to
nothing with the 2.x code on Apache.  (Due to waiting for it to get
stable and a general mistrust of multi-threading services.)  I guess it
is time to learn it.

All in all, this is a VERY promising release. It has some rough edges. 
(To be expected with a beta 1.)  If they can clean up those and fix a
few of the more unusual problems, it could be a very worthwhile release.
I am pretty happy with it so far.

Did you get the slash before the n? "\n" is the newline character.

:%s/\n/,/ 
	#correct

worked for me on the list you gave. Whereas:

:%s/n/,/ 
	#incorrect

would replace "n" w/ "," like you mentioned.

This looks like you need to set your scsidev to 0,0,0 (I'm assuming you
have only one CD burner and that it is an ATAPI device running through
the scsi emulator).  Try using the "test scsi" button.

I checked it on an HP-UX box...if I use vim then it works as advertised.
If I use vi then it doesn't work.  In fact in vi you can't use %, you have
to type 1,$.

Anyone know how to specify the newline in vi?

I'm suprised the "%" doesn't work in vi on your HP box - they must be
using a very very old version.

You could try the control-v trick:

:1,$s/ctrl-v<enter>/,/

The control-v is a quote mechanism in (some versions of) vi, as in
insert the next character in this search string rather than process it
immediately. In the above example, type control-v then hit your enter
key, so don't type out the brackets or anything like that.

Actually that worked for me

:%s/\n/,/

However more correct is 

% - apply to all lines in the file
s - substitute

Here's how I generated the list:

I have a text file with email addresses and a bunch of other information
separated by semi-colons.  The email address is the first field, so I used
cut to pull it out like this:

cut -f1 -d\; myfile > newfile

So when I use :%s/\n/,/ it doesn't work.  I'm using vi (vim) on a RH 7.3
box.  I can still get what I want by doing this, however:

:%s/$/,/

And then doing 999J to join all the lines.

Is there something special about the cut command that doesn't put in the
newlines?
Thanks,
~M

How do I find out the version of vi that I am using?

I can't find the command line switch.  So I tried :version and it says:
HP Version R  Oct 27 2000 00:57:16 $

I find HP-UX to be odd.  Not to be rude to HP, but I feel like HP-UX is
the worst version of UNIX I have ever seen.

Oh well...

OK, now I'm confused...  Even when I manually edit a file, create a list
of names and hit the enter key after each one, then try the substitute, it
doesn't work.  Any guesses as to what the problem could be?
Thanks,

P.S.  The :%s only replaces the first occurance of what you're searching
for in each line.  To replace every occurance in a line, you would use:

:%s/old/new/g

I'm guessing that your original text file doesn't terminate with lines
with newline, but rather (DOS-style) carriage return+linefeeds.

Here's a text file created with notepad on a Winders machine:

srau at slobyj:~$ cat dostext.txt 
nothing
space 
tab     
srau at slobyj:~$ od -c dostext.txt
0000000   n   o   t   h   i   n   g  \r  \n   s   p   a   c   e      \r
0000020  \n   t   a   b  \t  \r  \n
0000027
srau at slobyj:~$ 

The octal dump (od -c) command is useful for showing the non-printing
characters, and show that the lines are terminated with \r \n rather
than the most more sane \n.

vi --version

gave me the same output as :version from within vi, which was somewhat 
more copius than yours:

[snip]

If this is the case you will see a `^M' after every line when viewing
the file on the Unix box. Here's how to get rid of them in one swoop in
vi (read sentence after this command for details):

  :1,$ s/^M//

There's a trick to entering this. the ':1,$ s/' part is entered normaly.
When you get to the ^M part, instead of entering it as it looks, execute
a Ctrl-v-m. That is, hold down the control key and hit the `v' and `m'
keys consecutively.

The `Ctrl-v' part says, ``Get ready... I'm about to send you a Control
character.'' The `m' key, then, is said character. Do not release the
Ctrl key during this sequence.

The rest of the command (//) is typed normally.

Just edit your xinitrc file.  :-)

It's in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc (where it is symlinked to whichever WM I

Assuming that the list is not the only thing in your file and you eyeball
the number of lines involved you can:

(with cursor on the line with bob)
5Js/ /, /g

or if you'd rather not guess:

:set nu
[ see what the line number is for first and last list item]
:1,5j #substitute real line numbers
:s/ /, /g

^^ Though it breaks on items with embedded spaces so perhaps you'd rather:
:1,5s/$/,/
:1,5j

  
There's a couple of vi-isms to do what you want.

I expect Heinlein will weigh in with a more powerful method.

  Don't you need to escape the '\' in '\n', like so: :%s/\\n/, /?

Message-ID: <OKEEKGABPKHHEONMOAEPKEMIGGAA.cb@onsitetech.com>

I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for a tape backup system
for production use.

My Requirements:
Runs on Linux
backs up Linux boxen
backs up Win 2000 boxen (would like to stay away from smb mounts if
possible)
handles autoloaders

The solutions I've used in the past I am not too thrilled with
(tar,bru,dump),and I am looking at Arkeia (my quote is somewhat on the high
side).

If anyone has any recommendations or experiences, I would love to hear them.

I've used bru (love it) and MicroLite's BackupEDGE but never with a tape 
loader.  Bru is extremely programable since it acts a lot like tar.  

BackupEDGE was still suffering a little from ecletic user interfaces when 
I used it a few months ago.  It doesn't seem quite so programmable though 
they claim you can.

I believe both are demo-able so you can play.  BackupEDGE's recovery setup
is incredable.  I had an upgrade go terribly wrong once.  10 minutes to
boot from the floppys I had created and however long it took to restore
from tape and the system was back up.

Bru claims to have a similar system but I've never tested it.


Good hunting,
Rod

There used to be an app that would switch it for the current desktop. 
It was part of the Gnome configuration tool, but has gone missing since
Gnome 2.x.

I know I can hack it at that point. I tend to avoid the system wide
changes for Window managers.  (If I can help it.)

Problem solved.  No mixer input was selected as the record source.  I knew 
better, but it was late.  (I had to be reminded and the twenty bucks was 
changed to beer for the helpful plugger).

Finally got Audigy 1.1 to compile and it is working fine.

I got to thinking, does PLUG have a treasury of any sort?  I'm sure there 
must be expenses incurred at some point.

Would be cool for folks that wish to express their thanks to the list to 
have a place to dump donations.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0207151455010.26676-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Last week, with help from the crew here, I was able to remap the keyboard
-- particularly swapping the left control and caps locks keys -- for both
consoles and X applications. What I learned today is that the X remapping
doesn't hold for VMware sessions.

  This was not a problem with the programmable keyboard for it sent the
proper scan code regardless of what application was reading them at the
other end of the cable. But, the new board is remapped via software.

  I went to print a couple of maps from one of my two, legacy Windoze apps
and couldn't figure out for a minute why ctrl-a didn't bring up the dialog
box. And the silly caps lock light was blinking on and off. :-) Finally,
realization hit.

  Has anyone remapped a keyboard so it's consistent with VMware, win4lin or
another OS emulator running on linux?

TIA,

Rich

  The bru crew bought the company from the previous owners and have revised
-- and improved -- all versions quite substantially. They do have a version
that works with tape loaders, but I've no experience with that.

  I've used bru since 1997 and the software has worked without problems. The
documentation has been insufficient in the past but I've no idea about it
now since I am more familiar with what needs to be done. The support is
outstanding; can't praise them enough. Twice they helped me diagnose
hardware problems with the tape drives and they're always available and
eager to help. In my book, that's worth a lot. I continue to pay them $100
per year for unlimited tech support and any upgrades issued during the year.
I've called on support once in the past three years and I've received one
upgrade (to 17.1), but the payment is an insurance premium for me.

  Check them out rather than going on what they were in the past. They're
now called The Tolis Group, but it's the same folks (without the former
upper management).

I got to thinking... that *is* an individual user setting quite often.

Sort of.  I use bochs with my entire keyboard remapped and it works fine.
But the draw backs are that bochs is the slowest emulator I've ever seen.
Takes a day or two to build 2.4.16 and the host computer is 1ghz.  It also
only emulates the hardware and at a very basic level.  Like Pentium with
limited (basically none) pci support.  I'm not sure what the graphical
support is like.  The webpage says that it runs Office '97, so I guess it
can do windows things pretty well.

I'm only using it because I can play around with OS without risking
screwing up my computer.  It works great for that...but if you want it for
serious work maybe not...

Maybe it helps...

OK, here's the contents of a text file after the od -c is run on it:

0000000   b   o   b  \n   s   a   m  \n   j   o   e  \n   m   a   r   k
0000020  \n   s   a   l   l   y  \n   m   a   r   g   e  \n
0000035

So there are clearly newline characters.  But...  the :%s/\n/,/ doesn't
work.  SoooooOOOOooOOoOOoooo...  Any guesses why?  This is a default
RedHat 7.3 install.
Thanks,

I worked out something with a friend of mine on his DSL line.  Not much,
but it's dirt-cheap.  Grazie a tutti!  (Think I'm ready for Italy?)

Makes me wonder what sort of market there is for low-grade colo
facilities.  In all this research, I hardly found any businesses
offering less than $200/month.  Seems like if you could set up a simple
shop for low-bandwidth small fry like me, you could seriously undercut
the competition.

There was no slam intended by me.  I've been using bru since 1994.  I
REALLY like it and will continue to use and recommend it.  Like you I'm
set in my ways.  Bru works for me like I need it to so I've never had a
need to go looking for other software.  The BackupEDGE experience came to
me rather than me looking for other options.  I have one of those very
neat BRU cups sitting here and I wish I had the time to try out CRU so I
could completely ignore the other stuff.  If it works anything like bru it
will be killer.

I'm guessing the default vim that is installed doesn't deal with \n. 
Since you said that this file is generated by a command, how about if
we just make it look the way you want it?

Previous command | tr '\r\n' ',' > newfile

Though I think this will leave us with a trailing comma.

Note that I didn't include the Whack-a-mole install method in the 'serious' 
section of the letter. What I -was- pointing out, though is that this is the 
way most users think, and it's the sort of user behavior that can get 
conditioned in - I actually first heard it described in a report of a power 
plant accident - operators had gotten used to cancelling alarm klaxons 
without checking 'what did I just turn off' - and in one particular plant 
this had actually become somewhat of an autonomic reflex.

In the investigation following the accident ( a steam line rupture to a power 
turbine - I hate when that happens, but you can make off with plenty of squab 
if you can get to the roof quick enough - bring salt and pepper.) several 
operators had been asked 'what alarm did you just cancel?' after being 
observed, and they were unable to answer. At least one such operator denied, 
or was unaware of cancelling the alarm.

The data record showed that one particular alarm on the turbine that failed 
had been cancelled TWENTY-SIX times in a row, within less than an hour. "In 
effect," the report read, "the machine said 'OK Fine, I give up trying to 
warn you. You win. I die now.' "

A similar sort of double-return hit can get conditioned into user behavior if 
a common task (delete, erase) is ALWAYS followed by 'Are you SURE? (Y/N)'

In any case, thanks for the 'real' suggestions, - I'll see how it goes.

I want to clarify - Actually, I like BRU (I used v14 IIRC when it was EST),
the only problem is the win2000 client is 6 months away.

Message-ID: <51AE6EA505FCD111AB5600805F653ACB010AA223@exchange.ci.albany.or.us>

First, (if you haven't already) check all of the mixer settings.  (With
whatever... gmix, kmix, or whatever you have.)  Make sure the right device
is selected for recording input, and that the levels are up.  (If you have
studio setup, the VU meter lights should show levels... but only while
attempting to record.  If you get no lights, you're probably not getting a
signal.)

Also make sure that the channels aren't muted.  (If using ALSA drivers, I
know they all are muted by default.)

The more I think about it, the more I think the mixer settings are what need
checking, especially considering studio isn't getting anything.


But, in case you've already done all of that (and it isn't the problem),
here's a couple links to gramofile.  (I use it for initial recording anyway,
even if studio is working.)

Homepage

RPM's someone built.  (On SuSE, but doesnt' think there would be any
compatability issues.)

And there is always plain old sox.  At least to eliminate the possibility of
program problems, till you are sure the card/input channel/mixer settings
are good.

Matt,

IIRC, the default RH install gives you vim-minimal when you use `vi', and 
vim-enhanced when you use `vim' from the CLI. Try editing the file using
`vim' rather than `vi' and see if you can do the substitution.

I can give a good guess, though I'm really rusty in vi, so I can't say if
this is the case for vi.  Many editors (particularly older ones), are very
line oriented and don't actually even keep the newline in their memory
buffers (so it can't actually match on a newline character because it
isn't there).  Some of these editors do not allow for the concept of a
pattern that spans multiple lines (which any thing with a newline in it
would be), and for many of those that do, they use a special character in
regular expressions such as "$" to represent the concept of "end of line"
or newline.  In all of these editors that I can recall using, doing what
you want was possible, but for at least some of them it might require a
multiple stage process (or creation of a macro), so that you would first
do a search/insert to add your comma to the end of each line, then
perform some kind of "join" to add the next line to the current line.

FWIW.

It is just calling Gnome at that point.  It is setting the true Window
Manager at some other point.

Carla,

Thanks for the advice.  I formatted it NTFS, but then I could not resist. I
made a backup of the data I wanted on a CD-R.  Then installed RedHat 7.3 on
the drive.  I think that will be a better backup than using NTFS.  87)

Hi Derek ,

Thanks for your advice.

I fix the problem now.  It was my mistake running the command

# cdrecord -scanbus  (without a space between "cdrecord" and "-" (the minus 
sign)

The only remaining problem is "I can't get "Gcombust" run on KDE desktop 
automatically"

"Gcombust" would not fire up on executing the command "KDE-Start" --->"Run 
Command".(cdrecord -scanbus) on the screen.

However I could start "Gcombust" by evoking it from

K-Start ---> Quick Browser ---> usr ---> bin ---> Gcombust

Also I can create an icon on KDE desktop to start "Gcombust" but I hesitate 
whether it is the correct way.

Could you please shed me some light and where can I find its manual

Thanks in advance.

Stephen Liu




I can get "Gcombust" to start
I have to link it with a shortcut

The differentiation doesn't happen on my RH7.3 box based on running it via
vi versus vim.

$ rpm -qa | grep vim
vim-minimal-6.1-2
vim-common-6.1-2
vim-enhanced-6.1-2

$ vi --version
VIM - Vi IMproved 6.1 (2002 Mar 24, compiled Mar 27 2002 18:19:08)
<--snipped lots of other output--->

:%s/\n/,/

works in vim when run as vi or vim, and even when run as "vi -C" or "vim
-C" which sets the Compatible option, which will "make Vim behave mostly
like Vi."

It also still works with the vim-enhanced RPM removed. I'm really curious
now...

I must be thinking of something else.  Are you wanting to be able to
switch between gnome, kde, fluxbox, windowmaker, etc... or a window
manager inside gnome itself?  If the latter, I totally misunderstood ya.

After I did my hacking on the installer (for K12LTSP), the icons
appeared. Maybe a bug in the beta build?

If I was a betting man, I'd lay my money down that the package icons
will be in the final release.

The underpinnings of the installer are almost identical to the Red Hat 7.3
versions, with three notable exceptions. The gui is GNOME 2.0, the core
config file (./RedHat/base/comps.xml) is now XML (obviously), and there is 
an option for LVM in the disk druid.

Try fiddling around with GRUB for a while. I won't use LILO anymore,
GRUB is much harder to screw up - and if you do screw it up you can 
drop down to a command prompt giving you a chance to fix the problem
and get the machine back up and running.

If you mess LILO up, you have to break out the boot disks :-(

Yeah, it's almost usable. Not bad at all for a first beta.

I am wanting to use a different non-Metacity WM within Gnome.  I already
know how to change the others.

I will probably just dig around in the configs.

I hope not. The list view was better.  (I tend to use text mode though.
The gui install failed, so i had to do it that way anyways...

I still use fdisk.  (I don't need much else when building a laptop.)

I need to dig into the installer more.

I need to find a good overview of how GRUB is supposed to work.  The
commands are a bit alien to me.

I use the Slackware install disc for that. ]:>

I am finding a few other odd quirks here and there.  Not too much that
is difficult.  Of course, most of what I have installed since that point

I am not sure what you mean when you are inside the /var/mail folder but
there are lots of ways on the command line to send mail.  Look up mail,
pine, and elm for some choices on how to send mail.  Use the command,
"man" as in "man mail" to find out more.

Hope that helps.

Cool! I bet if Linus were to come up here we would not have much trouble 
finding someone willing to host it. I would be willing to host it but my 
backyard is not particularly big either. However, I would host it in a 
minute if there were not a bigger backyard available. :-)

I am thinking that the best way to make Linus want to come up here is to 
make the event(s) seem very low pressure. I understand that he does not 
like public speaking -- thus, having him as a "guest speaker" is probably 
not the best idea. It would be more like he hangs around Portland for a 
couple days and attends a barbecue/party or whatever.

Anyone know what his hobbies are? Climbing? Bicycling? Hiking? Softball? 
White water rafting? Bigfoot searching?

And I am not looking for the obvious hobby here. :-)

Whatever his hobby, I am sure that a Plugger or an ACM can host him in 
pursuing it.

Here's 99% of what you need to know about grub under "usual" conditions:

 * The config file is /boot/grub/grub.conf (symlinked to /etc/grub.conf),
   you should be able to get the syntax down in about 15 seconds. The
   "default=?" line is the default kernel, as listed counting from zero.
   (i.e. the first kernel listed is "0", the second is "1", and so on)

 * you don't need to run a command after editing the grub.conf file, GRUB
   reads it when the system boots

 * to modify the boot parameters (say like the old "LILO: linux single"),
   use the arrow keys to select the kernel you want, hit "e" to edit the
   config, select the portion you want to edit (usually the second line which
   contains the kernel paramaters), hit "e" to edit it, hit return when you're
   done, then hit "b" to continue booting. It's fairly obvious once you've
   done it once or twice.

 * I don't want to reboot right now, am too lazy to RTFM, and can't remember
   off the top of my head how to drop down to the "boot monitor" prompt.
   I believe it's listed right on the initial bootup screen. There is a 
   help facility that explains the basics of each command. The big "gotcha"
   for me was that if /boot is a seperate partition, grub acts as if it
   chrooted to there (i.e. "/boot/vmlinuz" is "/vmlinuz" to grub).

As am I. I should add that I had no trouble substituting \n's with commas

Billy,

You should be logging into a user account to send mail. It's not necessary
to cd to /var/mail or login to the mail server to send mail. And you should
certainly not be sending mail as root under normal circumstances. As Jon
correctly pointed out, there are a number of mail user agents you may use to
read, send, forward and bounce mail (although he left out my favorite -
mutt).

If Jon and I have failed to understand your question, please feel free to
set us straight.

cheers,
Sandy

Geez you guys, how much backyard are we talking here? My yard is by no means
vast, but I'm happy to offer it...should I expect an invasion like I'm some
sort of small country or what??

I have the perfect bbq salmon recipe too. Should my backyard (see above) not
do the trick, I'll at least bring a recipe and some salmon or something. (:

Well, I guess it depends on how much attention his visit would attract. I 
guess I don't have any way to gauge that. I mean would it be just 25 or 50 
Pluggers and ACMers or would it be, say, a couple hundred people who would 
show up for such a thing? Would there be reporters?

I think it would be relatively low key (and hope it would be) but I just 
don't know. I would hope for a really, really relaxing and mellow event. 
Knock on wood.

cool, on the barbecue salmon recipe! And now we know that we have 
backyards available. :-)

Heck, we should have a barbecue this summer regardless of whether we get 
Linus or whomever. Tis the season.

Incidentally, would the CS department at OGI, OSU, or other local 
college/university be willing to at least match that figure? Does anyone 
have connections in any of these departments who could look into the 
issue?

If ACM at PSU came up with $200 from their CS department (which Jason 
Dagit said he could do), and OGI gave $200 then we are at $400. That would 
leave only $200 to raise -- assuming Jason's estimate of $600 is correct.

It would then take 20 donations of $10 to get the rest. I bet you would 
get more than 20 donations at that level and probably a few generous souls 
who would donate a bit more.

Perhaps this same system of a little help from the universities and some 
small donations from Pluggers and ACMers could be used to bring in some 
other guests?

Also, I will check with OSDL to see if they want to bring Linus in. 
Perhaps they would be willing to fully fund his visit. Last time I talked 
with them they expressed interest in Linus in particular as a guest.

Hi all!

I just moved into town and wanted to drop a line to the LUG and introduce myself...

Enough of that, ack!

I see there is a meeting this Wed at a pizza joint, and there has been a good amt of chatter over
the last hour or so on the list.  What is the general participation level like?  How many generally
show at monthly meetings and such?  I'm planning on showing up to meet some good folk, drink some brew,
shake some hands, etc.

Anyhow I've got lots of free time, and am looking for a project to fill it with.  If anyone needs a 
test subject let me know :)  

Cheers,

The thing I am having trouble with here is:  Why?

What is the point of having Linus come to Portland?  What do you
expect to accomplish?  

I am not saying that there _isn't_ a worthwhile reason, but if you
have trouble articulating one that holds water, that should tell you
something.

Getting him to autograph a book, just "hang around" or whatever sounds
pretty lame to me.  In my experience, people with young children have
better things to do with their time.  So if you've got something more
weighty, please let me know what it is, because it isn't obvious.

With Stallman, I see the point: letting him articulate his (I think
"important") ideas about freedom to young impressionable minds.  With
Linus, whose philosophy is basically to "have fun programming" and who
doesn't really want/like to articulate (i.e. speak publicly) about it,
I _don't_ see the point.  Maybe someone can show me the point.  If it
exists, someone _please_ do.

Quite honestly, not to accomplish anything in particular at all other than 
I thought it would be fun for him and for us. If it would not be fun for 
*him* as well, then he should not come.

We all love Linux and it would be cool to have the inventor of it here. 
That's it, nothing more profound than that. If he does not think it would 
be fun or interesting then he won't come (obviously).

Just as I think it would be cool to have Sir Edmund Hillary here because 
he tells great stories. I would love to have met Carl Sagan and 
talked with him about the possibility of intellegent life on other 
planets or what social effects he thinks "first contact" will have on 
the world. I would loved to have met Mark Twain or more contemporarely 
Edward Abbey just to have met the people who have created things that I 
admired and enjoyed (their books). No particular purpose to it though.

Yes, I think his visit would have more of a purpose to it yes.

Linus probably won't come up here but I am not the only one who thinks it 
would be cool if he did. No big deal though. BTW Russel, I am really not 
interested in a flame war about any of this. Thanks.

On Debian, I think this file is typically located in
/boot/grub/menu.lst.  One of mine looks like this:

   default saved
   timeout 5
   serial --unit=1 --speed=9600
   terminal --timeout=5 serial console

   title   Linux 2.4.18
   root    (hd0,0)
   kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18 root=/dev/hda1 console=ttyS1,9600
   savedefault

   title   Linux 2.4.16
   root    (hd0,0)
   kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.16 root=/dev/hda1 console=ttyS1,9600
   savedefault

The savedefault stuff is to remember what you booted the last time and
make it the default.

You can install GRUB to a boot floppy while you are getting used to
it.  Then "grub-install" to the hard disk when you are more
comfortable.

See the GRUB manual for details:

  <http://www.gnu.org/manual/grub/index.html>

Eric>  * you don't need to run a command after editing the grub.conf
Eric> file, GRUB reads it when the system boots

Right.  As I understand it, LILO sort of "cooks" a boot environment
for you, a static sort of thing.  GRUB, on the other hand, is more
dynamic.  It groks file systems, reads text configuration files or
interactively-provided configurations during the boot phase.  While
booting, you can use GRUB to search for kernels, do tab-completion,
etc.  Just way more flexible than LILO.

Ah yeah.  While GRUB groks file systems, it doesn't grok /etc/fstab
AFAIK, so your filenames are relative to the filesystem root.  GRUB
doesn't know that your boot partition is going to be mounted under
/boot, so you give it a root device descriptor (hd0,0) or whatever,
and the kernel path is relative to the root of that filesystem.

I think this is a great reason.  Everyone knows that Linus hates giving
speaches and hates formal engagements.  If he was invited to just hang out
with no pressure involved, he might be very interested.  It could be a
nice vacation to a beautiful state.  Maybe we could even provide a list of
things to see and do while he's here.

Just to clarify, the raise $200 from OGI's CS department is for the 
Stallman visit.

Exactly.

I understand he likes beer (especially Guiness). Hmm, Portland is only the 
biggest brew pub town in the country -- and a there are Irish pubs that 
know how to properly pour a Guinness. Am I right or am I right?

I think it would be much more cool if there was some reason for him to
come.  Something that engaged his grey cells as well as ours and our
neighbors.

And, I mean, Portland is a good public transit town.  What if it was
one of _our_ buses that hit him.  We would never live it down.
Millions of people around the world would look at us and tearfully ask
"Why?".  That's an awful risk to take "just for fun".

Linux Advanced Topic Talk Wed July 17th

[Hey look I updated the date this time!]

Speaker Phil Tomson 

>From Phil's Note:

I've created an open source, object oriented, task distribution
framework I call TaskMaster.  TaskMaster allows users to easily create
their own runnable Task objects that can be distributed to multiple
machines on a network (which are running a slave program).  Tasks are
sent out by a designated 'master' machine to available slaves. When a
slave receives a Task object it runs it.  When a slave completes its
assigned task the master then 'harvests' the resulting data from it. 
Potential applications:
* Testcase distribution (that's what I was using it for): testsuites for
some software packages can contain thousands of testcases, distributing
them across multiple slave machines can result in getting test results
faster.
* Distributed software builds: sort of a distributed 'make' where a
large piece of software (the Linux kernel for example) that has lots of
hierarchy can be built in pieces across several machines more quickly
than on one machine.
* Distributed computation: I have an example where I use several
machines to calculate the value of Pi using the Monte-Carlo method - the
more machines that are added, the faster the computation should go
(given fairly equal performance of slaves).


--------------------------

Meeting is at 7:00 pm at It's a Beautiful Pizza on Belmont
                   <www.BeautifulPizza.com>
                       3342 SE Belmont
                    Portland, Oregon

Directions:

         East on Belmont to Zupan's Grocery, then find a place to
         park other than Zupan's lot. Pizza is two doors east of
         Zupan's, on the SOUTH side.  This is the new location~

                



         BUS: #15    http://www.tri-met.org/schedule/r015.htm
Belmont
                     10 frequency (east/west) 3:30 to 6:30.
                     15 frequency (east/west) 6:30 to 9:00.
                     30 frequency (east/west) 9:00 to 12:00.

         BUS: #75    http://www.tri-met.org/schedule/r075.htm
39th
                     ?? frequency (north/south) <5 blocks east>

If you cross the Morrison Bridge Eastbound, you land on
         Belmont, continue straight about 30 blocks. Parking is
         at a premium for those who drive. The place will be on
         your right just past Zupan's. 

         Belmont is one block south of Morrison, 5 blocks south of
         Stark, 10 blocks south of Burnside; and 6 blocks north of
         Hawthorne.

lol. 
We should also not risk bringing him so close to Redmond. ;)

Actually (being serious now) ... a good reason to bring up Torvalds
would be to give *him* a vacation.  

Now, I would imaging that if he came up here, there would be quite a few
folks wishing to see him.  I like the BBQ & beer idea, but it wouldn't
be a happy little get together with 300 (or even 100) people.  What if
we could do the BBQ thing and at the same time, do something useful
relating to Free software?   What I'm thinking is: we could do an
auction or raffle (some sort of money generating thing) to see who gets
to go the the BBQ w/ Linus.  The money we raise could either go to a
random OSS project, spreading OSS in Portland, or making sure Torvalds
has a *really* fun time around here.  If we did the latter, he might
even enjoy it enough to move up here... ;)


sound like a plan? what do you folks think?

Sounds like a lot of work for Linus.  Being mobbed at a public event is 
bogs of work.  How would Tove and the kids fit into this BBQ?

Let's send him to Breitenbush.  He hasn't had a good sauna in years.

I've been using LRP (current incarnations called LEAF,
leaf.sourceforge.net) for two home networks (with only httpd and sshd
available to the outside) for over two years, and am delighted.
Recently I've been using the "Bering" distribution, which is airtight
out of the box and quite easy to setup.  It works fine on an old 486
box with a floppy and ~8 meg of RAM.

I prefer BRU to Amanda,  but Amanda works.
It has a minor potential drawback in that it requires a swap space of it's
own, or spooler if you will, that is either as big as the largest file you
have to back up or all the data you're backing up,  I forget which.
When you exceed this free space you don't get a complete backup,  naturally,
and  an email telling you to change the size of the spool filespace up a few
more gigs...actually ou get email confirmation every night whether it worked
as planned or not.
Otherwise no complaints.

I went to my RH7.3 box and tried the edit with vim, and an explicit call to
/bin/vi (to ensure that I wasn't invoking vim through an alias) and the
substitution works fine.
As an additional sanity check, I ran the file through unix2dos to see if
having \r\n as line ending would make a difference, which it didn't.

Do you have a ~/.vimrc file?  What are the contents?

I've used two linux-based firewall "distributions" in the past. Neither was perfect, but each had its good points.

Mandrake SNF (Single Network Firewall)
Based on the older 7.2 release, it had a decent web-management interface.  Ability to backup firewall
rules, make changes to the running system and perform online package and system updates via the web.
Downsides were that documentation on the system is poor.  Among other things, the interfaces are hard-coded 
but nothing mentions this.  eth1 MUST be your internet conn., and eth0 is the local private if. It will 
mysteriously not work if it's not configured this way.

Smoothwall 0.9.9 (uh oh)
This system works pretty nicely.  The web interface is much more capable than the Mandrake one.  It has
a squid caching proxy, Free S/WAN, snort, good logging (although no built-in alerting/emailing). You can
also add rules to the fw through the web if, never used it though. Oh, it also has the ability to access
the OpenSSH server from the management page, and even gives color shell access, just like you're there! ;)
Unfortunately, the dns proxy has been dying on it lately and it's been hanging at the console (probably
a hardware issue).  This was the "trial" GNU version.  Smoothwall has a commercial product which is 
possibly more full featured and stable.

Hope that is useful, 
Cheers,

Yes,  mdk SNF is nice,  I've played with it.   I believe you can auto-update
from the web interface too.
eth1 MUST be WAN, that irritated me a little.
but Snort logs were useful.
www.zelow.no/floppyfw is popular with PLUG folks I know,  I use it too.

Isn't /bin/vi on Red Hat boxes just an alias for /bin/vim-minimal in
"vi-compatibility mode"?  I mean, /bin/vi is actually owned by someone,
(like Sun who has a restrictive license on it) so all we can use are
the various clones like elvis, nvi and vim, etc.

My only concern is where would we host it?  I have a feeling universities

Like I don't already have enough to say, I'll chime in again here...

What if we were to explicitly invite the fam to come with him? I mean, how
often do you think *he* gets invited to speak or whatever as opposed to an
invitation for him and his family? We certainly have enough stuff to
entertain a family for a few days.

It might be an interesting angle if we wanted to pursue this crazy idea any
further. (:

You might check out Seawall and Shorewall, fairly straight forward to

.tar.tar, 'eh?

Strange.

tar -xvf xxx.tar.tar

then see what you have and act accordingly.  A tar file?  tar -xvf
xxx.tar.  A directory?  cd xxx && ls ...stuff like that.

If you're in KDE, you can just click on the archive in Konqueror and go
from there, too.

If there's a program in there you want to install... well... that really
depends on what the program is.  Inside the archive there should be
instructions.  Often (aptly) named INSTALL or README or README.install 
:-)

Good luck.

Oops.  Sorry, my work box is RH 7.2.  I tried this on my home RH 7.3 box
and it worked fine.  I don't have a .vimrc file in my home directory.
Here's the RPMs installed:

vim-minimal-5.8-7
vim-common-5.8-7

The 7.3 box has:

vim-common-6.1-2
vim-enhanced-6.1-2
vim-minimal-6.1-2

So I figured that this little handy dandy substitution was part of the
vim-enhanced package, but after installing it, it still didn't work.  Odd.
Are other RH 7.2 users able to do the substitution?

The newline substitution works on a RH 7.2 box I just tried w/ just 
vim-common and vim-minimal. I ran /bin/vi both with and without the -C 
"compatible mode" switch.

Does

rpm -V vim-minimal vim-common vim-enhanced

report any discrepencies?

I give up.  I just upgraded to the RH 7.3 vim packages and it all works

Billy,

Let's keep this on the PLUG list so that others (more knowledgeable than I)
can add their two cents. I've set the Reply-To: header on this email to the
list (plug at lists.pdxlinux.org).

Sending and receiving mail is generally done by using a program designed for
that purpose rather than directly invoking the system utilities (like
sendmail) used as a foundation for a friendly user interface.

Your choices of MUAs (mail user agents) is going to be a function of who
administers the server. If it's you, then you can install whichever program
you like. Otherwise, you're at the mercy of the sysadmin. It's probable that
you have pine and elm. Good resources for learning about their use (a topic
far too extensive to tackle in this email) can be found at these web sites:

   Linkname: Pine Information Center
        URL: http://www.washington.edu/pine/ 

   Linkname: ii.com: All About PINE: IMAP, NNTP, & ESMPT for Unix, MS Windows,
             and Mac OS X by Nancy McGough

   Linkname: ELM - Electronic Mail for UNIX                               
        URL: http://www.instinct.org/elm/

You can also type in `man pine' and `man elm' at the UNIX shell prompt to
read the online manual pages.

You'll need to learn to use a UNIX editor in order to compose mail. Most
beginners start with pico, joe or vi. You can find information on these by
using the `man' command (e.g., `man pico', etc.), and also at the following
web sites:

An excellent way to learn pine is to type 'pine' at the command prompt and 
check it out. The menus are fairly intuitive.

$ pine

Pine uses pico by default and it is completely intuitive. Up arrows to 
move your curser up, down arrow to move your curser down, etc. Backspace 
to backspace over a typo. And at the bottom of the screen are commands 
that are available such as ^X (ctrl-X) to send your email.

I urge you to just try it by sending a series of emails to yourself and 
responding, etc. You will learn most of what you need to know about pine 
in 10 minutes!

I've been looking for a device that would allow me to measure the
power used by a piece of equipment for quite a while now.
The only ones I've found were very expensive.
I found such a device at Fry's the other day:

Product:  Watts Up?
Price:    69.95
Descript: Little black box that plugs into a 120v outlet and has a
          120v socket.  It has an LCD screen that will show you the
          watts being used among other things.

Comany:   Electronic Educational Deveices, Inc.

          Denver, CO, 80210
          www.doubleed.com

This thing takes all the guesswork out of sizing UPS's,
power balancing, etc.

  This would make a very good topic for a HOWTO or, at least, a newbie
tutorial on the PLUG web site. Mail is a confusing topic for the newcomer
because there are 3-4 components (one of each must be present) and multiple
choices among each component. I'll start this HOWTO with a brief summary.

  Linux (and other unix-like systems) mail requires separate steps,
depending on whether the mail is coming in or going out. Let's start with
sending mail.

  The interface between you and the world of Internet mail (e-mail) is
called the Mail User Agent (MUA). The command line offerings include (but
are not limited to) pine, mutt, elm and mail. The GUI offerings include (but
are not limited to) sylpheed, netscape, mozilla, kmail and ... (I can't
think of more right now). The functions of the MUA are to allow you to read,
organize, store and compose mail messages. Most of 'em (many, anyhow) store
mail in /var/spool/mail/<your_username>; others store mail in ~/mail/.
Anyway, the MUA is what most users see as their e-mail "system". But, it's
only one part.

  When you compose a message in your MUA and want to send it out, the MUA
hands the message to the locally-installed Mail Transfer Agent (MTA),
unless, that's built into the MUA. Most linux installations include
'sendmail' as the MTA. Others available include postfix, elim, qmail and
smail. The function of the MTA is to determine (by looking at the message
header created by the MUA) whether the recipient is local or outside your
network (or single machine). In the latter case, it checks where to send it
(details skipped here) and ships it off. So, sending mail is the simpler of
the two processes.

  Incoming mail requires one or two additional components. If you do not run
your own mail server (whose address is publicly visible on the Internet),
especially if you dial into your ISP to collect mail waiting for you on
their server(s), you need a component that will fetch the mail for you. The
most common tool is called (quite logically), "fetchmail". Fetchmail will
use either of several mail protocols, the two most common (popular?) are the
Post Office Protocol, version 3 (POP3) and Internet Message Access Protocol
(IMAP). You can run fetchmail manually, from a cron job or as a background
daemon.

  Mail retrieved by fetchmail is transferred to your MTA for forwarding,
either externally or internally. If the message is intended for a local
recipient, the MTA passes the message to the Mail Delivery Agent (MDA);
procmail is the only one that occurs to me now. The MDA places the message
in the recipient's inbox or other message file based on recipes that control
how it processes incoming messages. This makes it useful as a spam filter,
too.

  In a nutshell (no trademark violation intended), that's linux mail. While
it's overwhelmingly confusing at first, when you understand the components
and how they work together then it all makes sense and is quite clear. In
concept if not in practice. :-)

HTH,

Rich

  I notice, too, how we all call things "intuitive" once we know them well.

  Finally, pico is a horrible editor! With pine -- and perhaps with other
MUAs -- you can install your own editor. Almost anything's better than pico.
IMO, of course.

Message-ID: <1026844384.12932.4.camel@summanulla.clueserver.org>

I found this after a little bit of digging.  i figured it was something
weird and obvious.

The script that sets the window manager is /usr/bin/gnome-wm.

If the environment variable "WINDOW_MANAGER" is not set, it looks
through the list and runs the first one it finds.  Check the script for
valid options.  (I do not have Gnome 2 on this machine yet.)  The ones I
remember are "metacity", "sawfish", and "sawmill".  There are a number
of others on the list.

It would be nice if it were a little easier for the average user to
find. Glad I am not the average user...

Ken,

  Linux has two clocks. 'rdate' sets the system clock and it's valid only as
long as you're logged in. 'hwclock' sets the hardware clock, and this is the
one you want to set correctly. Once you do, you can tell the sysclock to
sync against the hardware clock. I don't recall off-hand just where it goes,
but it's one of the startup scripts.

I've been following this thread and thinking it sounds like a great
idea. While what I have to offer in the way of help for folks on things
related to Linux is still somewhat limited, I do have something to offer
in the way of entertaining out of town visitors. I've been a tour guide
in the greater Portland area for a few years. With a day or two's
notice, I can be prepared with tour naration for the Old Gorge Highway,
Mt. Hood, Mt. St. Helens, North Oregon Coast, and Portland City Tour.
With a little more notice, I could work up a naration for anyplace else
in the area.

If it helps bring a speaker to town, I'm happy to donate this service.

It's a pellet.  Made of wood. :P

Get some mesquite, hickory, oak, cherry, or whatever (probably from Texas :)
and grind it down.  Then smash it into pellet shapes and put it in a bag.  A
little different, but a little more convenient.

>  and Why is "Texas" associated with it.

Simply a model number, nothing more.  Actually sortof designed like the old
barrel-style texas wood cookers.  But with auger-fed pellets instead.
That's all.

Look here if you really want to know.  They have some goofy looking ones,
and big commercial rigs.  But I like mine.
http://www.traegerindustries.com/

Not a full blown pit or wood cooker, but much better tasting than any
propane or charcoal rig.

Dude, this is PLUG.  Portland Oregon.  Just who is foreign here?  :)  Of

Grill = fast cook
BBQ = slow cook
Smoke = really slow cook

Guys,  mine does the same thing, and although I did it in the Mandrake

Hence my posts having odd times.
The funny thing is,  it seems to randomly change between 12 hours off and on

Michael,

Most versions of sed don't parse `\t' to mean <tab>. To enter an actual tab
character, you need to escape it with ^v (Ctrl-v). e.g.

sed 's/[<Tab>]//g' foo.txt > bar.txt

...where <Tab> signifies ^v followed by a keyboard tab.

You've got lots of software solutions based on Linux suggested.  So I'll

a dialup connection right now) but when my iDSL connection gets here I'll
be playing with it for sure.  The Asante is pretty easy to set up because
of it's web-based interface but the down side is it is very image
intensive so using links or lynx doesn't work very well if at all.  I plan
to make a suggestion to Asante about this.

I'd have to agree with Rod wholeheartily here,  like,  unless you have old
486's and just want to putz with linux for self-edification  get a Dlink,
Netgear, or what he uses,  you CANNOT go wrong, and it's much much quieter

Chaz:

Good find!  I have been looking for something along those lines for a
while, but like you have only found fairly expensive things.  Although for
sizing a UPS you don't even need something this fancy (a simple ammeter
will do) this device measures total Watt-hour consumption over time.

Now that's pretty cool.  How much does that window AC unit really
cost?  What about that space heater?  What if I want to leave my PC on all
the time and crunch Marsenne primes?

Another good FW is the Sbox from SofaWare. It's more on the expensive side
(315), but provides a higher level of protection (stateful) and its
configurable through a web interface. It's also easy to setup VPNs and DMZs.

Subject: [PLUG] how to host a dns server on a dhcp ip... ?
Message-ID: <004e01c22d11$b136fca0$7cf397d0@imarkpdx.com>

Out of curiosity...
if I have a few domains... and I registered them through register.com and
wanted to manage the DNS on all but 1 on my home system which is on a cable
dhcp, how should I go about doing that?

I already have a dynamic dns client setup on it with dynu.com

let's say I have the following domain names registered:
server1.com
server2.com
server3.com

and I used the register.com dns to point server1.com to my dhcp system via
the dynu.com (is that possible?)
anyhow..

what would be the next step to have the dhcp system ready to accept dns
lookups for server2.com and server3.com ?

can I say that server1.com is the primary dns for this domain?

if so, how is this done? I tried to delete the register.com dns servers and
add server1.com as the dns server, but it said it was not a valid dns
server.

any pointers or tips?

Subject: [PLUG] Partitioning Schemes
Message-ID: <3D349407.8010700@sun.com>

I took a Solaris sysadmin class last week - it was quite fun, we got to
play with Ultra 10's, setup networking, NIS servers, installation,
partitioning, etc etc etc.

Probably one of the best things I learned was how to partition a disk.
Not that I didn't know *how* before, but now I know *why*.

Layout (explanation to follow):

p1: /			50-80 mb
p2: swap		2x ram size
p3: /var		200 mb+, depending on server type	
p4: /usr		30-40% of the rest of the disk
p5: /home		the rest of the disk

Here's why:  The spindle spins faster around the outside, and partitions 
are created from the outside -> inside.  You put the things that get 
accessed the most on the fastest portion of the drive - IE /bin, /sbin, 
/tmp, /lib, etc.  Those things usually don't take up a whole hell of a 
lot of space anyway, so the partition can be small.  Next, put the swap 
partition, again because it's faster out there near the outside of the 
drive.  Plus - if your most-accessed things are *right next to it* on 
the physical disk, the heads won't thrash as much.  Next come /var (for 
/var/log - class taught /var/adm, but that's Solaris, not Linux), /usr, 
and /home.

Depending on what your system role will be, you'll have to decide how 
big to make these.  If it's a print server, /var/spool/lp is going to 
fill up right quick at only 200m.  Mail server, same deal.  Install a 
lot of desktop apps?  Make /var bigger.  Mount /home via NFS?  Do away 
with /home.  Like/want/need a /boot partition?  Have at you.

My point is that for better performance, putting a small root and swap 
partiton right next to each other, then divvying up the rest of them for 
the disk is even better than playing with hdparm.

If I had known this beforehand, I would have definitely done my system 
partitioning differently.  I might run some benchmarks before and after 
I redo it on my desktop, just for grins.

Cheers,

-Richard

I recommend the lrp, too.  I have it installed in several businesses,
and have had no significant problems.  (The floppy sitting open in the
drive for 6 months will collect enough dirt to make it unbootable.)  I
have been playing with a bootable CD-ROM version that is very versatile,
has lots of extras (DNS, Squid, Weblet, FREE-Swan, and more) and the
basic configuration is held on the CD.  A floppy is used for custom
configuration changes (or can be used for booting if your machine won't
boot the CD).  It looks like it should be possible to modify the CD
image for each customer (so you won't need a floppy), but I haven't got
that to work, yet.

Good Luck

You'll need to register with your dyndns provider to have them serve as
your DNS provider for the domain names you wish to serve from your
system.  I'm not sure about your provider, but dyndns.org does this.
You'll not be using register.com to provide DNS anymore.
They also have links to good tech information on the details.

As far as setting up servers 2 and 3, you do the same thing.  You'll need
to register each name with the dyndns service.  I'm not sure, but you may
need to run a client for each domain name it's providing DNS for, so that
the DNS entries are upated each time you get a new IP via DHCP.

Hopefully this helps you some.  If I haven't understood your question,
lemme know and I'll reconsider :)

Cheers,

/eli

I always put the swap at the end of the drive.  In today's high-capacity
drive days, the swap is almost always very small in proportion to the
rest of the drive.  Having the swap always be 2x the RAM size is also
something I don't do myself.  Depending on the use of the system and
amount of RAM, a gig of swap is usually quite excessive.  The faster
your swap is, the better, IMHO.

not exactly what i was thinking.
as of right now... i have an account with dynu.com doing dynamic dns towards
my machine.
its matchboy.dynu.com

now i have server1.com stuff pointing to matchboy.dynu.com, and it works
just fine. virtual hosting...no problem.

ok, i want to manage DNS with Bind on my machine now for server2.com,
server3.com, etc.
at register.com i can either use their dns services, or specify a dns server
to manage the domain.
if i leave server1.com on their services...shouldn't i be able to point the
other domains to one of my server1.com references?
i created a dns.server1.com, and it points out to the machine just fine...
i tried to map server2.com to dns.server1.com, but it said it was an invalid
dns server.
any thoughts?

i'm sure that someone has gotten this to work somehow.
any help... is greatly appreciated. :-)

End of the drive meaning closest to the spindle?

I agree with the amount of swap - I can't see making a 1.5gig swap 
partition for my primary desktop.  However, our instructor said that 
Oracle's *only* supported configuration calls for at *LEAST* mem*8=swap. 
  Our class thought this was quite funny, as the product that most of 
the people in there work on is a system capable of having over 500 gigs 
of RAM.  To which the instructor quipped, "And that's why you're getting 
into the terrabyte drive array market, is it not?"

Of course, my aforementioned desktop system hasn't even touched its swap 
partition.  On my server systems, which are 200MHz Pentiums, or my 'new' 
web surfing appliance (150MHz Laptop), partitioning things in this 
manner would make a big difference in the amount of thrashing.

Your mileage will vary.

I believe that the data is going by the head a lot faster at _the
beginning_ of the drive than at the end.  So, if you want speed, I
would think you'd define your swap partition starting at cylinder 0.
But maybe I've missed something here about your disk geometry.

Ok sorry, I did misunderstand :) Not the first time.

Actually, I don't think you can do what you want.  You're looking to use
your dyndns served/DHCP client system ,matchboy.dynu.com, as a DNS
server for the other two domain names you have.

Unfortunately for you, an authoratative DNS server _must_ have a static IP.
That's how the system is arranged, out of necessity.  Your system which
receives its IP address via DHCP from your isp, and its DNS listing from
dynu.com just can't be listed in register.com via its IP address as it
changes,
and you can't do it by DNS name (matchboy.dynu.com).

Good luck with a resolution.

Cheers,

/eli

Well, I guess I could have had it all backwards... but I thought the
begining of the drive was the inside and the end of the drive was the
outside?

The outside of the drive spins a lot faster than the inside of the
drive.  Their angular velocity is the same, but the radii vary greatly. 

Sorry if I had that backwards!

No, Linux has one clock, the system clock.  In normal cases the
platform has a hardware clock (PCs, most workstations), though odd
systems and some embeded hardware lack an RTC.


date rdate, ntpdate, whatever all access/set the system clock.
hwclock (for most platforms) sets system time from hardware or sets
hardware time from system time.  The older 'clock' app did this as
well, but has been retired. (hwclock uses a new and safer access
method than clock for get/set from hardware RTC)


System time is is set from the RTC using hwclock in one of the init
scripts for most systems.  It has nothing to do with any login
session.  It persists until reboot.


Given time, the system time will drift vs RTC time, and both will
drift from real time.  This is why running an ntp client is a good
thing, it keeps the system clock synced.  During system shutdown (for
most distros) system time is written back to the RTC within the init
scripts.  This ensures that as of next boot the RTC is "close enough"
to real time that the initial system clock is near enough to synced
(within 70 seconds for many ntp systems) that the ntp client can drift
the system clock into sync, rather than jumping it. (jumping the clock
must be done manually from the command line and with the client daemon
shutdown)

Yes, convention with current HD tech is tracks start at the outside of
the platter.  Peak transfer rates start with track 0, and decrease
from their.


This is why putting your swap partition first is not such a bad idea,
and putting your bulk storage last.

let's just assume that this server is static...
how can i make this system work easily?
given the ip is 200.200.200.55

if i point dns.robbyrussell.com to 200.200.200.55
shouldn't i be able to run bind listening on dns.robbyrussell.com
and tell register.com that server2.com is going to be managed by
dns.robbyrussell.com ?

First, I don't know :).   You could try it and see, only recommendation I
have.

But it generally takes a long time (8-24hrs) for that to make the rounds.

I may be missing something obvious, but I guess it's worth a shot.

  Thank you; I realized that I didn't explain myself well.

  The rest I didn't know -- or recall -- as I don't deal with it on a

I think, position of partitions on a disk is generally
pointless micro-optimization.  My instinct is if there is a
difference, it's not a big enough difference to matter for
average use.  Benchmark it and make sure.  This type of
thing needs to be benchmarked; it's quite hard to predict
the right answer, especially now that disks are very smart
devices.

My partitioning strategy these days is aimed at robustness
and low maintenance and backup-friendliness.  One partition
for /, one for swap, one for /home.

The biggest delay is probably track-to-track seek time,
which is constant for any distance, so it shouldn't matter
where on the disk you put the partitions.  But again, run
benchmarks if you care.

  It's been several years since I partitioned a hard drive for a Red Hat
installation, but I recall not having any control over where partitions were
placed nor how they were numbered.

  I recall trying to define a file system of a certain size and with a
specified name (e.g., /dev/hda5), but the Red Hat tool would sometimes --
usually, actually -- rearrange things despite what I entered.

  Is this a Red Hat thing? What does one do to specify where file systems
are placed on the drive?

TIA,

Rich

I'll definately agree with this.  However, I understand that some folks
have lots of free time and want to play around.  ;-)

Some drives' (and SCSI cards') translation from SCSI blocks to disk blocks
do not necessarily follow the start-at-the-outside-and-work-your-way-in
convention.  This is especially true if using CHS addressing rather than
LBA.

Benchmark to be sure, but if performance is that critical, then there are
lots of better things to do.  (Caching, striping, etc.)

Be careful of developing some bizarre, hard to maintain disk layout in the
name of performance.

Hi all,

I need opinions.  I'm installing the Covalent ERS 2.1 on a Mandrake
8.2 box.  All package files are owned by root, setup executed as
root (tried direct console, no su, and under X) and the installer
says to exit and run as root.  When setup is executing, ps shows it
as owned by root.  

Any ideas why, other than a bad installer? 

Thanks for input,

Hello all,

I'm having a problem installing the Covalent ERS (commercial
Apache package).  The installer must be run as root, and I've
done so in a non-x environment as root (no su), under X, etc.
However when the installer is run it says to exit and change
to the root user.  Any ideas why it would think it's not root?
All files in the install package are owned by root, when setup
is run ps shows it as owned by root.  My root acct works ok 
for normal activity, not restricted in anything else.

If you have an opinion or recommendation, or need info lemme know.

Thanx,

[snip]

Funny you should mention the Asante. I have had great luck with the
Asante router/firewall. However, this came up just a week or two ago:

 http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,102596,00.asp


It's an ActiveX exploit. It passes through as HTML 4 on port 80.
Unfortunately, the router won't see it. I checked for a firmware update
but even the latest version does not combat against this.

Yes, this was a ``head's up'' for me too.

What we have to do is find a firewall that is capable of Content
filtering. In other words, a firewall that does not allow ActiveX or
(optionally) Java traffic from the Internet.

Yes, I know this causes problems (especially Java) processing normal B2B
functions. The way around this is sight-specific configuration. This
means telling the firewall, ``do not allow Java traffic through unless
it is from this domain. And for goodness sake do a reverse IP lookup to
make sure they are who they say they are.''

Better yet, use time-sensitive encryption keys, VPN, e.t.c.

It's a significant optimization.  I used to work for a streaming video
company and did some disk tests there to determine optimum disk layout and
block size.  

Consider the simple case of a disk with a useable platter that ranges from 1
to 3 inches in diameter.  The rate of data flowing by the heads at the
outside is 3 times greater for the outside tracks than the inside.

At the risk of firing one of the first shots in a text editor holy war, I'll
say this for pico: It's easy to figure out as a newbie. When I didn't know
much else, this was easy to figure out for the basics. Once I got stuck in
vi by mistake and made a bunch of frantic phone calls to see what I had done
to my shell account. Another time I got caught in emacs and it was equally
intimidating. I really thought I'd broken something serious and that there
was no escape. Say what you will about pico and how it lacks in certain
things, but when you're still new to The Land Of The Command Line, it helps
keep you from straying into The Land Of The Lost.

The redhat installer likes to do it for you.  There is a method to
handle it manually, but it has been some time since I bothered dealing
with RedHat.

Once can always use 'fdisk', the basic command line tool, instead of
any of the menu based or automagic progs.

Yes, but for the most part it holds true.  By habit I locate my swap
at the beginning of the disk, it helps.  For most other things it
really does not matter though.  It can easily be a 15% difference in
throughput inner to outer, but only assuming you are not bottle necking
elsewhere.  Other than when you are heavily into swap it makes little
difference.

Why leave them out?  Who would invite people to a BBQ and tell them they
couldn't bring their family?

I wasn't thinking he'd have to do anything.  Like you said, he doesn't seem
to care for being a "speaker".

To say thank you, really.  That's all.  In a way that we might be good at.
Good food, good beer, and get the family out and about (away from the home
base) for a little bit.  Sort of a mini-vacation with travel and lodging
paid.  Or something. :)

Maybe it is just a silly idea.  But it sounded kind of fun to me.  At least
worth a thought.

It sounded to me like geek-celebrity-cling-fest, which might seem

Going to a party with 200 strangers just to have them all huddle

find celebrity-worship, cult-of-personality obsession revolting, and

Yes, but your problem is streaming video.  Typical disk
usage is not anything like that.  If your system is
streaming large amounts of data from your swap partition,
then you have other performance problems that probably won't
be helped much by moving your swap partition to a faster
disk cylinder.

I think it was a good summary but I believe the person in question had a 
shell account on a Unix system and was wondering what to do for email. In 
his particular case, using pine with its default editor pico would be just 
fine and probably the quickest and easiest way to read his mail.

No, I don't think that is what it would be like at all. It would be a 
barbecue with a guest of honor. Parties are held with guests of honor all 
the time. It does not mean everyone gathers around the guest of honor 
every minute.

To honor someone who has done something interesting is different than the 
celebrity-worship you malign. That sort of worship is characterized by 
people being famous for being famous, not for their achievement.

In the late 19th Century it would have been great to have had a barbecue 
and invited Mark Twain. I believe he enjoyed talking and circulating. 
Maybe Linus likes that sort of thing or maybe he doesn't. I don't know. I 
know he does not like formal speaking engagements so I suggested something 
less formal.

There are alot of others in history and in the contemporary world that I 
think I would love to meet (or have met). The list is long and it 
includes absolutely no celebrities (in the sense that you are 
describing). My list would be a pure meritocracy and I believe that it 
would be the same for most others here.

You don't like the idea which is fine but it is time to let it go. You 
have already expressed your opinion several times. Others do like the idea 
and ultimately anyone invited here will have to make the decision for 
themselves.

Uh... this is RMS we're talking about here. He'd be willing to lecture
about this ideas three times in one day! Furthermore, he's got more than
one speech in his bag; software patents, dotGNU, you name it.

Having RMS lecture at three schools in Oregon would actually be optimal --
he'd get the widest exposure of this ideas for the amount of $$$ needed
for transportation. One caveat is (I've heard) OGI is a big MS shop, it's
possible the students there don't even know who he is...

Hosting a lecture at PSU would also give some of the local PLUGers easier
access, although they'd miss out on our beautiful OSU campus. :)

So... time to get in touch with PSU-ACM and OGI-ACM ?

Bringing the folks would be nice; but realize it would triple or quadruple
Linus's airfare. This might prove more difficult if we intend to reimburse
him. Other costs -- food, lodging, etc. increase with the number of people.

Practically speaking, assuming Linus comes and we have a barbecue thing,
Linus is going to get mobbed. People won't come to the barbacue to talk
with Joe Schmo, they'll come to talk to Linus, or at least hang out near
him.

What might work is the old "$20 per plate" model -- limit the
number of people to something sane, like 30 or maybe 50, then charge $20
per person, with reservations accepted; first paid, first reserved. Then
the reimbursement is easy:

cost of airfare =  max number of people  *  cost per person

One person who is perhaps less celebrity famous but just as cool in the
free software community is Miguel Iczaga. To me, Miguel would be more
interesting just because he wrote the applications I actually see,
whereas I don't interact with the kernel on a daily basis. If Linus
doesn't jump all over the idea, maybe Miguel can oblige.

Just my 2 bits...

I am afraid that this model may be what needs to happen for anyone from 
out of town that visits, including Stallman.

In the case of Stallman I think the ACM should accept the $200 offered 
from the CS department, set a date for him to come, set a venue, and start 
selling tickets right away. Maybe make it a requirement that people have 
to buy a ticket at a least month ahead of time. That way, you have the 
money in hand before buying his plane ticket if possible.

With the $200, you need to sell 40 more tickets at $10/each. I can't 
imagine that you would have trouble getting *at least* 40 people to buy a 
$10 ticket to see RMS. You come to a PLUG meeting to sell some tickets, 
offer an address to send the money to to get a ticket, send the info to 
the Corvallis, Kfalls, and Eugene LUGs to give them the opportunity to buy 
tickets. Make the $10 the minimum donation to buy a ticket and hopefully a 
few people will chip in a little extra. Maybe you could get some people to 
act on your behalf in Corvallis and Kfalls who could help promote at the 
LUGs there.

I think the important thing is to get the momentum rolling. If you get the 
$200 and you set a date and venue and start selling tickets, I think the 
momentum will build.

ACMers carpe diem!! Go for it. I think the stars favor this thing 
happening!

I'd concur on this.  I don't fear either now, but if you aren't expecting
them they can be a little disconcering at first.

(vi in particular.  I remember getting dumped in that the first time, and ^C
didn't break me out.  I was pretty lost.  Emacs at least let me turn around
and run away screaming.  vi grabbed me in it's vice-like grasp to crush me
until I figured out the magic escape button sequence.  Well not quite that
bad, but you get my drift.  :)

I'd say my vote for good newbie console editor goes to joe.  (Don't really
care for pico, really.)  Says "Control-H for help" right at the top, and lo
& behold when you hit it there it all is.  Not bad at all.

I still find myself firing it up a lot for quickie stuff, even with other
editors around, and after getting used to vi.

(Which should probably be learned eventually... if there is no other editor
on a system, that or a similar one is going to be what you have to use.)

I thought the article was a bit odd, but it did have *some* sense.
If you use a computer in an attempt to cause physical (murder/attempted 
murder) harm to someone, then you can get get life in prison.

Not sure why they need a specific law for this... thought our current 
murder laws were suffice.

I have to agree that congress has gone insane for many years now.

This will come as no surprise, but I disagree selling tickets is
necessary or desirable in the Stallman case.  There should be no
trouble rounding up the travel funds.  I've already offered $50 and if
there was a serious need, I'd double it without thinking hard.  At a
university it shouldn't be hard to acquire a suitable venue for no
money.  Charging money, which I doubt is really needed, is only going
to keep people away.  The whole point is to get people to come and
hear.

Just for perspective, folks, roundtrip airfare Boston to Portland,
over a weekend in early October is less than $400.

Makes me feel better since my wife's computer is the only MS product here 
and there no Outlook or IE running on it - doesn't do mail from home and 
uses Netscape.  I will have to check out my clients though.

Thanks for the heads up.  I haven't seen it come through on SANS but 
probably ignored it since it is a  Windows issue.

Subject: [PLUG] bind with register.com type service
Message-ID: <006801c22da7$059849d0$7cf397d0@imarkpdx.com>

Since I didn't seem to come up with a solution with my question yesterday,
let me try this again with a different idea.

I have 5 domain names that are all registered through register.com
I want to let register.com manage server1.com and manage servers2-5 on my
linux box with bind.
if i create an A record on server1.com (using the register.com tool) for
dns.server1.com to point to my linux box... should be fine right?

now for servers2-5... after a day of waiting, i want to change the dns
server for them to dns.server1.com.

it's telling me that its not a valid dns server.
i have bind 9.2 running, and have setup a zone file for server2.com on the
machine... however, since register.com says its an invalid dns server, it
won't let me make the change.

any thoughts?
I' guessing that this is on my bind setup somewhere.

What steps do I need to take with bind to get it ready to accept name
lookups for server2.com ?

reverse name lookups?
has anyone on at&t cable had success with this? I got this to work about a
year and a half ago, but after the whole dhcp thing started, i moved
everything off of it, and don't have my old configuration. I'm just trying
to see what I can get away with, I can manually change the ip for
dns.server1.com on register should my ip change with at&t.

thanks for any advice or pointers in advance.

My only reply to a thread that obviously should be on plug-talk:

At 07:48 AM 7/17/2002 -0700, you wrote:

That missed the point. The point is that hacking or causing a DOS attack 
can get you a *LIFE SENTENCE IN PRISON*. Also, they reduced the hurdle to 
do certain types of wiretapping.

Why do I see yet another law like the teen anti-smoking laws, or the cell 
phone in cars laws. They aren't enforced, or there are already laws on the 
books that cover it.

Because then we'd be ruled by mob mentality. Can you imagine what would 
happen if all the idiots in this country got to write laws governing what 
you can and can't do? With enough technophobes, computers would be outlawed 
for personal possession, possibly entirely. I know plenty of people who 
still to this day believe that computers make our lives too easy, that they 
will take over the world from us, and that we won't be able to stop them. I 
*never* suggest to these people to watch "The Matrix". :)

I'm working on these problems.

I made phone calls today about a portable microphone and a projector.
Unfortunately, my contact has not gotten back to me yet.
I will try again - first thing tomorrow morning.

Also, after the last PLUG meeting I had:
      -  several people recommend moving the monthly PLUG meetings to
         It's a Beautiful Pizza.
      -  even more people complaining about the facilities

As a result, we will be keeping the general meetings at PSU for the
forseeable future.  (We are currently scheduled thru Dec 2003.)

                                                Dave Mandel

P.S.  I may talk to the owner about moving the after meeting meetings
to It's a Beautiful Pizza.  It would work well for that.

Clearly, that is true if the money can be raised without selling the 
tickets. The tickets were meant if the money can't be raised outright as a 
necessary evil.

That is a good deal. I wonder how much food, etc, would be a day?

Does anyone know of any perl modules to parse ASC X12 EDI data?

The usual Google and CPAN searches came up with very little.  ("x12 perl",
"x12 isa perl", etc.)  The most promising search was the "x12 isa
perl" which led to Paul Santoro's AT&T broadband home page where he'd
written up a nice document on parsing X12 on linux with C code.

... but no perl modules.

It might have something to do with the fact that the X12 standards doc
costs $600.  :-)

Has anyone talked to them (It's a Beautiful Pizza) about their sound?

There's always the slim chance that they'd invest in a little PA system if
people are trying to hold gatherings/meetings there, and ending up moving
elsewhere due to sound issues.  If that's all it'd take to keep some
business, ya never know... they might consider it.

(Never been there, but that's the first thing that popped in my head.)

the bash prompt is the environment variable PS1 ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile

export this variable....

Here's a nice prompt that I use in my ~/.bashrc

COLOR1="\[\033[1;35m\]"
COLOR2="\[\033[1;36m\]"
COLOR3="\[\033[1;32m\]"
COLOR4="\[\033[0m\]"
PS1="[$COLOR2\u$COLOR4@$COLOR1\h $COLOR3\w$COLOR4]\\$ "

This displays the full path of the current directory, \w, so you could
take that out if you don't want it.

The estimate I came up with (a generous estimate) was about $560 for the
trip.  With the CS dept offering about $150 that leaves the ACM with a
responsibility of about $410.  The food estimate was based on what I think
is a very generous 10/20/30 plan.  ($10 for breakfast, $20 for lunch, $30
for dinner).  I figure if he wants to stay 3 days (he always wants to get
here a day early), and eats lunch dinner the first day, 3 squares the next
day, and breakfast lunch the last day.  I've never done this before, but
those numbers seemed like a fair upper bound to me.  I know I can eat
lunch at a decent restaurant (chinese even) for less than $6.  And dinner
wouldn't be that much more.

I hope that clarifies the estimates.

This would be a nice simple prompt, but I can't resist adding two more
features.

PS1="[\@][$COLOR2\u$COLOR4@$COLOR1\h $COLOR3\w$COLOR4]\n\$ "

The \@ will put the time in the prompt (only updates when you hit enter,
but still nice), and \n at the end will put the cursor on a newline so
that it is always in the same colomn on the screen.

There is of course a howto for the bash prompt.  I would recommend it,
because there are quite a few color choices.

And if you want to test a prompt there are to ways to do that.  One is to:
$ export PS1="your new prompt "
or you can edit your ~/.bashrc or whatever file the prompt is in and then
type:
$ source ~/.bashrc

(But don't type the $, that just means do it at a prompt...)

Message-ID: <1026935094.32185.8800.camel@obelisk.spek.org>

Hello,
  Has anybody on this list been able to get PHP with the DBG
(http://dd.cron.ru/dbg/) debugging module working with DDD?  I've been
able to compile and install everything but DDD - as the supposedly
correct patch for DDD 3.3.1 (that allows it to use a DBG listener as the
"inferior" debbuger) breaks the compile for me.  My C/C++ skills are a
little rusty and DDD contains a lot of code to get up to speed on, are
there any elucidating tips (or working patches) that people have run
accross?

  Since I coudln't get DBG/DDD working I tried to get (my distant second
choice) APD (http://apd.communityconnect.com/) running, but it just
causes Apache to segfault anywhere from 30-100% of the time.  I'm
purposely not running bleeding edge versions of Apache and PHP (1.3.26
and 4.1.2 respectively) so I don't think it's because of them, but I
can't find any reference to how to avoid this problem.  Does anybody
that has any experience with APD know how to avoid the segfaults?

thanks,
Brent

That's shocking.  And, I think, it's a bad idea.

Personally, I find the food and drink WHILE a speaker speaks to be
distracting.  Also, the meetings drag on when there's no anticipation of
an after-event.

Separate spaces for talking and socializing are a great idea.

Is there a problem with the Lab?  I find it superior in lots of ways.  
Mostly, I like that there are more healthy and varied food options.  The
choice between pizza and salad gets old real quick.

You want true democracy? Go to any New England town meeting.
It's interesting entertainment and a lesson in how to do things
the slow and longest and most frustrating way.

My parents live in a town with open town meeting in Massachusetts.
I went once when I was still living there. They took two hours arguing
over a single $50.00 item.

Making bad CS analogies it sounds like despotic(sp?) or dictator rule is
constant time, them as you move towards true democracy it becomes NP-hard.
I wonder if it is possible to apply recursion or some other trick of algo
design to improve democracy? :)

Maybe there is a clever divide and conquer approach?  Perhaps that is the
role that representatives are supposed to play.  But I think in this case
they may have blown the stack...

Message-ID: <200207172203.g6HM3rmK011785@mdhost.cse.tek.com>

I woke this morning to a dead system.  I can't tell at the moment
whether or not this is a hard disk crash or a hard disk data
problem that reformatting or repartitioning might solve.  The
system was totally locked, and even the alt-sysrq-s wouldn't sync
the disks.  So, I power cycled the poor machine.  At the next
reboot I got:

    kernel panic: VFS: unable to mount root fs on 08:06

At a subsequent reboot I got:

    scsi: aborting command due to timeout: pid 0, scsi 0, channel
    0, id 1, lun 0 read(10) 00 00 5d 65 7c 00 00 08 00
    scsi0: aborting CCB #54 to target 1
    scsi0: CCB #54 to target 1 aborted

I did a Google Linux advanced search for the kernel panic
message.  95% of the Google matches were for people building new
kernels and/or screwing up their LILO configuration.  5% of the
messages mentioned that the boot record on the partition was
screwed up.  I the the latter is more likely for me, since I
haven't changed my kernel or lilo since Mandrake released their
security patched 2.4.8 kernel, i.e. many months ago.

So, I think what I need to do is pop in my Mandrake boot floppy,
press F1 at the boot screen, and enter "rescue" at the boot
prompt.  From there I'd like to do as little as possible to get
my system working.  In other words, if I can get away with just
rerunning lilo, rather than reinstalling, I would prefer that.

Anyone got suggestions?

Thanks....

No, it doesn't.  I was thinking more like <50, at a remote park or someone's
backyard or something.  Trying to keep it low key.  Maybe that wouldn't be
possible.  And if that is how people would behave, that sounds pretty
annoying.  Jeez... would people really be that lame?  Maybe so.  Sounds like
a bunch of kids.

Nah... I just wanted to give him a beer, a plateful of salmon and ribs or
something, a thank-you for all the effort, and get back to tending the food.
Huddling and clinging is creepy, and I wouldn't wish that on anyone. :)

I was actually thinking about just that.  Thought we should hash through
things a bit first.

And the person with the venue (backyard, if not doing a park or anything)
should probably be the one to ask.

Just be sure to give him a link to the list archive (incl. all of related
subject lines) so he can see all of the ideas if he likes, and maybe get a
laugh or two out of them.

Another thought... perhaps moving part of it out of Portland to someplace a
little more out of the way would help keep the guest list smaller, and cut
down on random drop-ins and party crashing. :)

Anyone up for a BBQ at Lake Owyhee?

My first thought is to check all of the cabling and make sure it's all 
okay.  Just because you haven't mussed with it doesn't mean that the 
10krpm drive didn't want to be free.  ;)

If all looks good, then ask the wife if the kids were anywhere near it 
while you were out.  ;D

THEN start mucking with the rescue disk.  Rescue disk is probably the 
best bet if it's not a bad cable somewhere.

That is a SCSI-level error which should be independent of your disk
contents (MBR or otherwise).  For some reason a SCSI command that Linux
sent out never came back.  This could be due to:

1) Loose cable
2) Unpowered or intermittently powered device
3) Poor termination
4) Dead disk
5) Driver bug
6) Some really obscure problem

I would avoid the rescue disk until the SCSI errors are solved.  Trying to
"rescue" a disk and having the process fail in the middle might just cause
more problems.

Unless it's an obvious problem (i.e. loose cable), I would quickly invest
in a replacement disk and get all the data on this disk mirrored someplace
else.

	I will open the box and make sure everything is tight.
	It could be a loose cable since I moved about 6 weeks ago and 
	didn't do any post-move maintenance on my computer.  So, 
	maybe a cable did come loose.

	If it's not that, then I have a spare drive that's somewhat

There's always St. Paul.  :-)

There are a few places we could set up in St. Paul, I think.  Could even
go down by da riva' ... but we'd have to fight the drunk highschoolers

You might see if the other party would be willing to set up or
exchange "ebxml", which is an international standard adopted by the
United Nations, and is XML (easy to parse :) and supposed to put an
end to the EDI nonsense.

See http://www.ebxml.org/ for more info.

What were you looking for?  www.sprocketdata.com had solutions for far
cheaper than that.  Heck, I'm *leasing* my own 800mhz box with 40G of
disk and 15G/month transfer for $150/month.  If your solution requires

Oh, I wish I could get rid of the whole X12 nonsense, but I have
essentially zero say in the matter.  The developers are unhappy with it as
well (they have slighty more than zero say), but we're just one of a dozen
companies communicating with a very large corporation on the other end who
seems to be deeply in love with terrible data exchange methods.  (And
unfortunately, they have all of the say in things...)

The one drawback to XML seems to be that it takes up more space.  Normally
I'd just laugh at a size complaint between a 10k file and a 12k file, but
when there are hundreds of thousands of files a day it does add up.

Are there any EDI methods using gzip?  ;-)

They often drag on with the anticipation.  Not having food and drink
help "formalize" a meeting.  Since the meetings are not formal at all, I
am not sure it helps.  I think we should be slightly more rigid with the
main meetings.

It does cut down on chatter.

Well I shifted us years ago from the McNemiman's Market Street pub to
the Lab.  This was due to space issues (well and service, but 40 people
fills the pub).  I would prefer something with better acoustics for the
socializing, but the Lab does have space.

Also some place that had beer and let minors in would be a big plus.

        I got suggestions to check the SCSI cables and verify
        that the drives are working.  I reseated all the SCSI
        connectors -- none felt loose -- and the SCSI terminator.
        The internal end-of-cable terminator definitely felt
        loose.  Then I powered up the box and after some fsck'ing
        I'm back in business.

        On the fsck'ing topic, if anyone has ever had to answer
        "yes" to its "blow away your file now?" prompts, then
        you might be as happy as I am to run Kirk Bauer's
        "check-packages" program.  It found the two packages
        who's files got toasted and I reinstalled them from the
        distro RPMS.  I've got tripwire checking to see what
        might have changed that isn't part of a package.

	Thanks for the loose cable suggestions!

I did a Google Linux advanced search for the kernel panic

kernels and/or screwing up their LILO configuration.  5% of the
messages mentioned that the boot record on the partition was
screwed up.  I the the latter is more likely for me, since I
haven't changed my kernel or lilo since Mandrake released their
security patched 2.4.8 kernel, i.e. many months ago.

So, I think what I need to do is pop in my Mandrake boot floppy,
press F1 at the boot screen, and enter "rescue" at the boot
prompt.  From there I'd like to do as little as possible to get
my system working.  In other words, if I can get away with just
rerunning lilo, rather than reinstalling, I would prefer that.

Anyone got suggestions?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0207172310580.1744-100000@localhost.localdomain>

I was browsing a magazine rack and noticed an interesting Ad on the back 
on _The Economist_ magazine:

Unbreakable

Linux

[Picture of a 4 computer cluster]

4 Computer Cluster with Linux

Everyone Knows Linux costs less
Now it's faster and more reliable too

Oracle


Note: The "Unbreakable Linux" bit was in very large font.

I found this ad interesting because the way the ad is presented it is 
*Linux* that is the main selling point not the name of the company running 
the ad (Oracle). It is also interesting to note that database is not 
mentioned anywhere in the ad.

These sorts of ads seem to me to be good PR for Linux because they present 
Linux as a stable, reliable OS.

Also, on the same magazine rack I leafed through _Business 2.0_ and they 
had an article about how Oracle's sales culture is backfiring on it. 
According to this article Oracle's renowned aggressive and even 
underhanded sales tactics are backfiring on it.

Apparently, the culture at Oracle encouraged a take no prisinors approach 
to sales. In fact, the sales manager at the time was called Ghengis Khan. 
In many cases salespeople from Oracle were deceptive, went around, 
through, and over people they were dealing with and generally did whatever 
it took to make the sale. Now, according to this article, there is a 
backlash against them for these tactics and it will probably take them 
awhile to live down this Mongol Hordes image.

In other words these tactics helped them in the short run and hurt them in 
the long run.

Though on second thought, Oracle is taking a little too much credit for 
the "reliable" part. But I think the PR effect for Linux still holds and 
is good. People will remember the general impression of these sorts of 
things: Linux good.

  I subscribe to "The Economist" and there have been several Oracle ads
featuring linux over the past few months. Oracle has bought the rear cover
which is the most expensive location for a magazine ad because it's seen
more than any other.

  It is good exposure.

  On your other point, Neil, why should Oracle be any different than
Microsoft, Intel or CA? They have the Morgan and Rockefeller dynasties as
business models.

I have never really found any books for PHP that I thought were worth

good.  It is published by Sams.  I learned a lot from it, but it is
nothing like the Llama book.

I will be one of the first in line when O'Reilly puts out their PHP
book.

Message-ID: <200207181521.g6IFLsZ24782@gate.daniloff.com>

Hello Linux folkz,
I received as a present Kensington Expert Mouse Pro.
It's a large trackball with four large buttons, four small application
launching buttons and scrolling wheel.
I can use it as a generic trackball with three buttons emulation.
Is there any chance to utilize scrolling wheel and/or the rest of the
buttons?

Thank you in advance for any thoughts or information.

Subject: [PLUG] Question on the "top" command
Message-ID: <3D36F0CA.F719AD6C@computer-arts.net>

Question on the "top" command (Red Hat 7.2)  Basically, what if 
anything, does the "Mem:" line actually mean?  On my system (with
256Meg of ram) it starts out with about 30Meg free, and after I've
run for a while it looks something like:

Mem:   126704K av,  120388K used,    6316K free,     756K shrd,    2056K buff
Swap:  522104K av,   57800K used,  464304K free                   56796K cached

The first time I run an app that sucks up a lot of memory, the "free"
mem goes down, but then it *never* comes back up over 10Meg free until
I reboot the system.  Am I actually looking at some kind of memory leak
in the kernel, is this just an "artifact" of top?  (Or do I just not
understand what "free" memory means?)

If I'm not mistaken this is just the behavior of the GNU libc or the
kernel (I can't remember which at the time).  When programs in linux free
their mem the kernel(or libc) knows the memory is free again, but doesn't
always report it as free.  Sort of like when you fork() a process.  To
your program it appears that you have a copy of every thing your parent
had, but it isn't until you try to access your copy that the OS gives it
to you.  This was a huge optimization in System V kernels (I think sysv),
since shells are so common and they have to do a fork() to call exec().
Exec() starts a new program executing, and it never cares about the data
that was previously running in that process.

Anyone know the details a little better?

It's my understanding that the 'free' memory is simply memory that 
hasn't been used for anything.  The kernel caches as much as it can in 
memory (as you use commands, etc), and uses it as a FIFO buffer.  When 
you need more, it gives it to you and drops the stuff you haven't used 
in a while.

When you start needing more memory for applications and data than you 
have available, that's when it starts using the swap.

Someone else will have a better explanation, I'm sure.

What's interesting is you say you have 256MB of memory but according to 
"top" on the "Mem:" line you have approximately 123.7MB of physical 
memory available not anywhere close to the 256MB of memory you say you 
have installed. The kernel uses some of that memory so that's why the 
amount available is less that what's installed but you should see a 
value well over 200000K as the amount of available memory on your 
system if you have 256MB installed. 

For example, on my system with 512MB of memory installed, "top" shows I 
have 513432K of physical memory available. Here's the output from "top" 
on my system:

Mem:   513432K av, 482480K used,  30952K free, 0K shrd, 43312K buff
Swap:  265064K av,  17484K used, 247580K free  216900K cached

You can also do a "cat /proc/meminfo" to see the memory usage on your 
system.

That use is okay but I think Jeme was referring to use of the hyphen as a
prefix for the parameters.

> gzip -cd xxx.tar.gz | tar xvf -

you can also do something like this with GNU tar:

tar xzvf xxx.tar.gz

and it will uncompress the archive for you, using the appropriate utility
(zip, compress, bzip, gzip). It *might* be slightly more efficient as
well. Likewise, I think you can also do:

tar czvf xxx xxx.tar.gz

instead of tar cvf - xxx | gzip > xxx.tar.gz

My question is, how do pass parameters to the compression utility using
this mechanism, ie gzip --best ? I know you can set GZIP in your
environment, but that seems a little awkward if you don't
want all compression done a certain way. Any ideas?

Minor correction...  if you have a file compressed with bzip, then you'll
need to use the j option, like this:

tar jxf xxx.tar.bz2

or, to create a bzip2 archive:

tar jcf xxx.tar.bz2 somedir

That caught my attention, too!

I've never heard of RH finding 128MB of RAM instead of the installed
256... I've heard of it getting stuck at 64MB, though.  Maybe passing
mem=256M (syntax correct on that?) to the kernel at boot time would be a
good idea.  At least as a test.  Then edit your lilo.conf accordingly.
(RH *is* still using lilo, right?)

My time is set to /etc/localtime ->
/usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Pacific.

I replaced the CMOS battery already. Sitting at a
console the hwclock seems to gain about 2.5 minutes an
hour. So maybe the new battery is a bit zealous. 

I don't seem to be loosing other settings. Any in
particular you're asking about? 

Another thing I noticed is that when I start gdm, the
system clock immediately looses about 2.5 hours and
seems to run slower and slower from there. So it seems
that there must be an x component to blame here as
part of the problem somewhere.

I downloaded a different kernel version and am going
to try recompiling. Haven't had time to do it yet.

I'll let you know how it goes.

You can, but with 7.2(?) and up, grub is the default (and in many ways

You might also look at /etc/adjtime and the adjtimex command, a while back
I had some weird problems with clock drift and found that something had
messed up the kernel clock settings.

Well, gdm isn't doing it anymore. Perhaps that has
something to do with the removal of the /etc/adjtime
file. I'm going to let it run this afternoon and see
how it does.

I'd like some help on the best install for an HP 1200 under a Debian Woody 
system using CUPS.  The CUPS is probably OK, as a previous printer worked on 
it. The 1200 is on the parallel port and works under windows.  

I tried the localhost:631 way and couldn't find the 1200 listed. The 1200 
supports postscript level 2 (emulated) and PCL 6.  I thing the current level 
for PS is 3, so I'm not sure about using it. I don't  know whether to go with 
cupsomatic or gimp-print. 

I'm not sure what the deal is on the ppd's. I thought the docs said they 
should be in etc/cups/ppd but they appear to be in /usr/share/cups/model.

Any help would be appreciated.

Aye.

Second minor correction, the f option requires a parameter that is the
archive file name.  So this would read:

tar cvzf xxx.tar.gz xxx

So you set the GZIP var for the current session or even the current
command.  You don't have to set it globally and for all time.

I've seen some bad RAM. and some bad motherboards that didn't see the all 
the RAM installed. Actually couldn't address it.  Simply reported 1/2 or 
1/4 of the installed RAM.

My understanding of RAM usage is the kernel will try to use all available
for running processes or as disk buffers (or cache).  As long as processes
don't need the RAM it is used as disk buffers.  When an application needs
more memory first go the disk buffers/cache, then less recently used
and/or lower priority process go into the swap file.  A rather simple
explanation from a simplistic guy. (simpleton to some :-)

When should you use PC1600 vs PC2100 RAM?
I don't want to spend the money for PC2100 if the system can't effectively
use it.

Mainboard:  Abit KG7
Processor:  AMD Duron 1.1GHz

Abit's documentation simply says that the board supports either.
Any insights appreciated.

Addendum to the correction :-)

The verification switch (-W, --verify) cannot be used with either a
compression switch (-j, -z, or -Z) or when piping tar's output to
stdout. You have to do two atomic operations, e.g.,

  tar cWvf xxx.tar xxx && gzip -9v xxx.tar

I think the duron has a 200 FSB so you can get the pc1600 (but don't 
take it from me), but if you ever upgrade the  CPU you'll wish you 
bought the pc2100

It's been too long since I've had to append a "mem" argument when 
booting Linux so I don't remember the exact syntax. I did have this 
problem on a Pentium Pro 200 system that had 128MB on it. Linux only 
saw 64MB of memory but I think this was back when I was using a 2.0.x 
kernel. I don't recall having this problem with the newer 2.2.x or 
2.4.x kernels.

If the CPU uses a 133/266 bus (I don't think any Durons do, but I could
well be mistaken) then PC2100 is well utliized.  If it runs on a 100/200
bus durons, I think) then the added 66MHz of speed between PC1600 and
PC2100 goes unused.

Do you see somewhere that has a price difference betwene PC1600 and
PC2100?  I wasn't aware PC1600 was even readily available any more
(kinda like PC100 vs PC133 several months ago).

Also, the mainboard isn't the fastest or likely best value around
anymore... if you haven't purchased yet.  The Duron is a good CPU,
though.  :-)

F-Prot has been one of the best scanners for over a decade.  Their virus
files are consistently very comprehensive and up-to date.  They have a
free command-line version available for linux:

http://www.f-prot.com/download/getfplinfree.html

The product includes a check_updates.sh script that uses "wget" to
retrieve updates automatically.

The Personal Windows version is $25 with free updates for a year.  If you
have lots of systems to protect, it's $2/system with a 20-system
minimum.  Dirt cheap!  The Windows version includes a real-time resident
scanner to detect infections before you can spread them.  (A must for any
antivirus software.)

They also have a free DOS version which is great for putting onto a
prebuilt portable bootable disinfection diskette.

2 free versions and one really cheap version.

Most startup companies with 1 - 3 employees demonstrate great team organization 
between each other.  This is because usually they talk about all the day to day 
activities and know their customers by name, likes, regular purchases and more. 
 This type of personal service with the customer usually leads to rapid growth. 
 Once the organization has grown a bit the new employees do not have the same 
relationship with the customers and either the founders of the company struggle 
to compensate for this or the company declines. This is a problem that faces 
almost all organizations; we have developed a tool and process that rectifies 
this problem.  Check us out at <http://www.teambooks.com>.

Hello Linux folkz,

Does somebody know any method/utility to convert scanned text

I know such software exists in Winblows world e.g. TextBridge.
Do we have something similar or better in Linux?

Not true.  Refer to tar info pages, "The Three Option Styles":

  There are three styles for writing operations and options to the
  command line invoking `tar'.  The different styles were developed at
  different times during the history of `tar'.  These styles will be
  presented below, from the most recent to the oldest.

  [...] 

  * Mnemonic Options [--foo style]
  * Short Options [-f style]
  * Old Options ["Like short options, old options are single letters.
                  However, old options must be written together as a
                  single clumped set, without spaces separating them
                  or dashes preceding them"]
  [...] 

So, "deprecated" is the wrong word.  "Unnecessary" is applicable if
"old option" rules are followed.

Option styles can be mixed, but "old option" style can only occur at
the beginning.

  It means "standard input". In the context of the above command, it first
gzips the directory then pipes the result to tar. tar takes its input from
standard input; that is, direct from the gzip operation.

Alex,

  There is a an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) project or two on
sourceforge and/or freshmeat. I've not looked at them for a year or more so
I cannot say just how far they've progressed.

  A google search for '+ocr +linux' will indentify all the options.

Trying to start the old' BSD-style vs. SystemV style flame-wars again?  I
think those embers are getting pretty cold these days.  :-)

  -- Steve

(Background and Trivia:  BSD commands generally used single letters as
options, and could be clumped.  System V introduced the use of "-" before
each option or group of options.  As with many other areas of UNIX where
lots of people had strong opinions and too much free time, some very
passionate arguments erupted on BBSes and newsgroups.  This syntactic
difference was evern featured in The Cuckoo's Egg as a means to identify
the attacker as one of those subversive BSD types.)  [Disclaimer, I don't
have my copy in front of me so it might have been used to identify him as
one of those overconfident SystemV types. ;-) ]

Well, once i reset the clock to the correct time once
again, starting gdm no longer had this effect. So I
was baffled once again. I let it sit at the gdm login
screen for an hour while i was away, came back and the
clock was off half an hour again. This time slow. I
actually watched it roll back a minute while i was
logging in.

*sigh*

And I was so hopeful the adjtime thing fixed it lol.

Yeah, I was considering recompiling xfree altogether.
Other than that and the kernel, I have no idea what

Tony,

I think you are right about the 2.2.x and 2.4.x systems.  I have seen
systems with more than 1/2 gig of ram that didn't need any special
parameters to use all of the ram.

The way ram is designed they often put large bit modules in parallel.
For example they might put 8 modules that are each 128 mega bit in
parallel.  So I think it would be odd if you can address only half the ram
because of a problem with the ram chips.  My understand from the limited
electrical engineering classes I've taken is that ram is very much all or
nothing.  Do you have another computer you can test the ram in?

Strangely, I have actually seen this happen with modern SDRAM modules.  
In particular, I had two 512MB PC133 registerred ECC SDRAM modules plugged
into my Intel BX400 (PC100) motherboard.  Something in the way the
"registerred" memory works only let my system see half the memory.

It worked great, but I only saw 256MB.  (The memory check during POST
also reported this amount.)

I returned it for un-registerred PC133 memory which presents the correct
size.

  -- Steve

PS: Blatant plug: www.cruicial.com was very helpful in some of my memory
explorations.  They never charged any return/restocking fee for an
exchange and always were willing to cross-ship.  In return, they got a
couple extra data points in their memory-compatibility database.

It means that the data which will be processed by tar should be read in
from a special location.  The location is the same place that keyboard
input comes from.  It is called stdin, or standard input.  In unix you can
redirect (that is, change the normal source and destination) of a file.
Stdin is considered a file, therefore you can redirect it.  In this case
the command will make gzip print it's information to stdout (standard out)
instead of a normal file.  Then tar is told to read information from
gzip's stdout and process that.

I appologize if this explanation is too simple, but from your question I'm
guessing you are not used to unix and linux file system and command line
yet.

Stephen> What is the '-' (minus sign) after xvf for

This just goes to show that Zot wasn't completely off his rocker last
night when he suggested that newbie questions were potentially
valuable for providing new/lost perspective.  

As I watched the cascade of duplicate answers to this question, and
also while I was researching the correction to Jeme's "deprecation"
claim, I began to wonder what the _point_ of the "-f -" idiom was.  I
mean, it _is_ ubiquitous without a doubt.  I use it frequently, but is
it really necessary???  I mean, why _bother_ telling tar you are going
to specify a filename if you are just going to tell it to substitute
stdin/out?  Why can't you just say:

  tar c /tmp | tar tv

and have it do the right thing?  Turns out, at least for current GNU
tar's, you _can_.  Boggle.

This also ties in with the whole sqrt() optimization thing that Randal
noted last night.  There is one arguably good reason to leave it in,
even though it is probably horribly wasteful machine-cycle-wise, and
that is, pedagogically, to make it clear what you are doing.  In
short, optimizations can obfuscate.

How about Kooka?

Supports the SANE library and does OCR via the GOCR project. I've never used 
it, just ran across it on the redhat limbo beta.

S*O*R*R*Y ... This was a most embarrassing typo. The system has
128 Meg of memory. The available, used, and free numbers all
add up. What I was having trouble understanding was that
when a memory hungry application runs, the free memory goes
down. But when the application ends, the free memory doesn't
come back up (it only does that after I re-boot).

What I *think* I'm understanding from the responses 
so far is that the top "free" number doesn't really
have anything to do with how much memory is available to
be allocated by a process, but rather how much memory
has never yet been "touched" for any reason.

So, Anthony Schlemmer suggested "cat /proc/meminfo", which 
does seem to give more information. Is the "Cached" memory 
shown there the memory that is actually available to, say, 
a malloc() call?  Does anyone know?

(I guess that same "cached" number does show up in top, but
it looked like it was part of the "Swap" information.)

Sorry for the confusion generated by my original typo. Wish
I'd started reading the responses sooner :-)

What "free" means is that it is "free", i.e., not used for anything.
What cache and buffer mean is that is still has stuff in it (such as
recently written data, etc) which might happen to become useful in the
future and which is orders of magnitude cheaper to fetch from an
existing memory block than from disk again.  Should the kernel need
memory, for something like launching another task, then it can grab
some of those memory blocks for the purpose.  So, just try to remember
that "free memory is wasted memory".

       (maybe `insmod driver'?)
lsmod didn't show ide-scsi until I modprobed it.  But that didn't help anyway.
Of course
mount -t auto /dev/hdc /mnt 
works.

What's the explanation?

Same disclaimer -- but I think it was the way the attacker invoked ps,

   Can procmail solve the biggest mailing list flame war of all time?

   If you're on a mailing list you know the argument. "This list should
   set Reply-To to the list address." "No it shouldn't." "Yes it should."
   "No it shouldn't, and I've got the Reply-To Munging Considered Harmful
   link right here".

   Personally, I prefer it when the list doesn't change Reply-To because
   if I run across an interesting free software developer on a mailing
   list and want to ask him or her to write something for LJ, I can do a
   "Reply", and if I want to follow up on the list I can do a "List
   Reply".

   But it's easy to understand why some people can be horribly wrong, and
   why this argument can drag on even longer than classics such as
   "Hitler was a vegetarian".

   Adam Langley, on the p2p-hackers mailing list, posted an answer: if
   you want Reply-To set to the list, and the listmaster of the
   righteous-folk list won't do it, put this in .procmailrc:

:0
* List-Id: Righteous folk.*
| formail -i "Reply-To: righteous-folk at example.org" >> $MAILDIR/righteous-folk

   If you don't want Reply-To set, and the listmaster of the wankers list
   sets it anyway:

:0
* List-Id: Wankers who munge.*
| formail -R "Reply-To" "X-Reply-To" >> $MAILDIR/wankers

   (I have modified these recipes slightly to use example.org lists
   instead of real lists. Substitute yours, and test.)

   You should be able to modify these to be "non-delivering recipes" and
   filter the mail, not deliver it to a list mailbox. This could be handy
   if you want to apply something like this to many mailing lists.

   "Wouldn't it be great if" of the day: "Wouldn't it be great if GNU
   Mailman would let users set this for themselves?" (And while they're
   at it, they could automate the entire "Hitler was a vegetarian" thread
   on the server side.)

   Here's that "munging" article, by the way.:

Have you recompiled the kernel to support scsi emulation?

I haven't really spent much time researching the Linux kernel (shame on 
me) but cache is associated with files. System performance can be 
increased quite a bit if data from a file can be accessed from a cache 
in physical memory rather than having to go to the disk and read the 
data. Linux tends to allocate as much memory as it can to filesystem 
cache to improve performance much as possible. It's a balancing act 
since too much memory allocated to cache leaves fewer free pages 
available for user processes.

My guess is that if a malloc() call is made and there is insufficient 
free memory available that the kernel will free up the least recently 
used cache memory pages and make them part of the available "free" 
memory pool to satisfy the malloc() request.

It's pretty amazing to see how much memory Linux can and does allocate 
to filesystem cache. After doing some large compiles I've done some 
large "rm" operations and when files are deleted the associated cache 
memory is freed up. In this scenario I've seen my system go from having 
only a few MB of free memory to several 100MB of free memory.

No. I didn't do that with RH 7.2 either and it worked there. How do I tell if 
my kernel (the Debian one) supports scsi? I assumed it was some module, 
perhaps ide-scsi.

Used to be ide-scsi needed scsi_mod loaded first.  This on kernel 
2.4.13-ac4.  Look in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/scsi/, if you 
have scsi_mod, modprobe it.

The other system (RH kernel 2.4.18-3) doesn't have a cdr burner to check. 
But the plain old cd uses a module `cdrom` used by `ide-cd`.  Can't comment 
much on that...

How's you syntax in /etc/lilo.conf?  Something like
	append="hdc=ide-scsi hdd=ide-scsi"

Another tool is
$ cdrecord -scanbus
you'll be a set when your drive shows up there.  Of course, by the time you 
make the kernel happy, you'll probably be done.

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

This is a great time to find out.  Look in /boot/ there should be a file 
called, config-2.x.x.  This is the config file you need to look at to find 
out if it's supported.

If it's not, apt-get kernel-source-2.x.x.  Then read the debian.README.gz and 
make the kernel the debian way, it's pretty slick.

Cache or no, I've heard a dual Duron box (a DuRunRun) will make your heart 
stand still.

But this breaks any posting made to the list where the originator has

So again, setting reply-to cannot be fixed by recipient compensation,

On someone's suggestion I messed with the jiffies
setting last night. Recompiled the kernel and set
jiffies to 100 instead of 1000 (gentoo comes with
default of 1000). No effect. I still loose time when
I'm sitting at the gdm login screen. I'm going to
leave myself logged in today and see if that changes
anything.

Running out of ideas here.

Ken

ps - thanks for all the help anyway though :)

A Rash of Vulnerabilities Come to Light
By Brian Hatch

Recently, a number of pretty devastating security problems have been
discovered. First, a bug in Apache was discovered that allows a remote
attacker to run code of their choice as the Web server user. This means
that, depending what you are running Apache as, the cracker could get on
as 'web', 'www-data', 'nobody', etc....

Depending on whom you ask, this vulnerability is not exploitable on
Linux, only BSD and Windows. However, GOBBLES, the security group that
proved it was exploitable on BSD (while others claimed it wasn't), hints
that they have a Linux-specific exploit as well. Upgrading to Apache
1.2.26 or 2.0.39 will solve this problem.

Next, we had a hole in OpenSSH that, under certain conditions, can leave
you vulnerable to a root compromise. You are only vulnerable if running
versions prior to 3.4 and have one or both of the following in your
/etc/ssh/sshd_config file:

    ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
    PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt yes

Upgrading to OpenSSH 3.4 will  fix this bug. The new version not only
fixes those bugs, but also enables Privilige Separation by default. This
new feature runs as much of the server as possible as a dummy user
(sshd), thus any vulnerabilities that are found should grant access to
the system as the sshd user in a chroot'ed jail at worst. This is good.

Both of these vulnerabilities were discovered[1] by Internet Security
Systems (ISS). Unfortunately, ISS released details about the Apache bug
with no honest attempt to provide the Apache team a chance to fix it.
Worse yet, the patch that ISS supplied did not fix the problem. ISS
contacted the OpenSSH team, who decided to fix up[2] the Privilige
Separation code, but ISS unfortunately decided, again, that the
limelight was more important than giving vendors the appropriate time to
fix the problem. ISS released their findings five days before OpenSSH
had scheduled the updated code's release. OpenSSH released the fix
minutes thereafter, but the extra time to get PrivSep working across the
board was lost.

In spite of ISS's irresponsible disclosure[3], both OpenSSH and Apache
had fixes out as fast as lightening. Linux distributions were close
behind, making RPMs and .debs available for users to upgrade.

As we speak, at least one Apache worm is on the loose, attacking Apache
Web servers that have not been upgraded. That this worm is barely making
a dent is a testament both to the speed of the Apache team and the
security-minded nature of Unix administrators. I've always said, Unix is
more securable than Windows.[4]

The last vulnerability that's recently reared its ugly head is in DNS
resolver libraries. In this case, a malicious DNS server out on the
Internet could send you an invalid DNS response that will crash or
compromise your software. The good news is that the Linux resolver is
not vulnerable; the bad news is that BIND, the default DNS server for
most Linux distributions, is vulnerable[5] -- rather, BIND4 and BIND8
are vulnerable, BIND9 is not.

The suggested fix for this has been to have all your machines query a
BIND9 host until you can upgrade your resolver software and the
BIND4/BIND8 hosts. This would seem to be a good idea, but it's still not
sufficient. DNS responses are trivial to fabricate -- DNS uses UDP, so
you only need to send a malicious DNS packet that arrives before the
authentic DNS packet. For the more paranoid, the best bet would be to
run a DNS resolver that discards malicious packets on each of your hosts
and query it instead of any server on the network. (You'd point to
127.0.0.1 in /etc/resolv.conf.)

However, the latest BIND vulnerabilities offer me an excuse to show
everyone how to install DJBDNS, an alternate DNS suite written by the
illustrious Dan Berstein[6]. So for next week, sit back as I show you
how you can ditch BIND and move to a package that, to date, has zero
vulnerabilities and a bounty for anyone who is able to find one.[7]


NOTES

[1] 'Discovered' may be a bit of a stretch, since others were also aware
    of the Apache bug and were already working on a fix for it.

[2] The Privilege Separation code for OpenSSH worked well on BSD, but
    had some issues on other common OSs such as Linux and Solaris. The
    OpenSSH team decided to disclose that there was a vulnerability in
    the software without disclosing the actual problem, and get
    community involvement to get Privilege Separation fully functional
    on all OSs. They set a one-week timetable before they'd release the
    next version with functional PrivSep code and the bugfix itself.

[3] For an excellent article on ISS' inappropriate handling of the
    Apache vulnerability, see Jon Lasser's SecurityFocus column at
    http://itw.itworld.com/GoNow/a14724a61093a76073993a5

[4] http://itw.itworld.com/GoNow/a14724a61093a76073993a3

[5] That BIND has yet another vulnerability should not surprise anyone.

[6] It should be noted that DJBDNS includes a client library as well,
    and it's not vulnerable to the bugs recently discovered.

[7] I'll be performing this upgrade in real time on a friend's system.
    We'll see if he notices.

That was interesting. So config-2.2.20 contains the actual kernel options 
used to compile the existing kernel. Anyhoo, it contains a line:
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI=m
and 
  /lib/modules/2.2.20/scsi
contains
  ide-scsi.o
Should it contain something else?

Message-ID: <000001c22f45$3de71b00$7ccfe00c@tina>

Hi all.  My Linux router died, so I need to build another.  I'm
interested in using a 486 I have handy.  What's a good floppy firewall
distro? My requirements are:

-I'm on cable, DHCP.
-I would like to run DHCP as a server for my home network
-I have to use a Winblowz machine to actually write the firewall floppy.

I tried floppyfw, But it would not boot on my 486.  Came up with
"Loading intrd.gz...  Boot failed: please change disks and press a key
to continue".  I tried a standard boot disk on this 486, and it worked
fine.

Help would be appreciated...

Richard

FreeSCO is the easiest to set up & use, it's perfect for a home network.

With the nature of floppy disks I would try a different floppy.  About 3
different floppies with the same image before giving up on the image.  It
is important that you try a different floppy, according to the Debian
install howto reformating the disk isn't always enough.

But I guess if the standard boot disk you tired was the same floppy then
it's probably something between your computer and the floppy image.

HTH,
Jason

FYI, Google actually has a Linux-specific search page (complete with
Tux-ified Google logo) at <http://www.google.com/linux/>. Pretty handy,
IMO, even if I haven't pinned down what exactly it does differently than

Very true. I am reusing a number of floppies I have acquired over the
years, & what I have started to do with each new one is run the following
test on it:

dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/fd0

If the raw write onto the floppy completes without a meaningful error
message the floppy passes the test. And may be reliable. The following,
despite the warning, *is* a successful write:

[geoff at joan]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/fd0
dd: /dev/fd0: No space left on device
2881+0 records in
2880+0 records out

I was asked to setup a fax server so we can eliminate the numerous fax
machines around our company and just use printers instead.  Has anyone had
any good success with this on Linux?  The server would have several modems
for each fax number and then I'd like the faxes to go to a particular
printer, depending on which phone number the fax came in on.  Also, the
user should be able to send faxes out as well, but I'm not sure how this
would work.  We have a mixture of Windows and Linux desktop systems.
Thank you for any suggestions.

I'm burning the ISO for slackware 8.1 right now.

I've run other distros in the past (debian, suse, redhat, turbo)..and am
currently using mandrake 8.2

If I'm running 8.2 (mdk) right now, is it worth the hassle of reinstalling a
new distro to put slackware on it? Is slackware 'that' much better that you
would reccomend this?

just curious, without getting into a whole big distro war.... if it's really
worth the trouble.

what are the biggest benefits to using slackware over mandrake.?

This is really good to do before storing data on the disks, but if memory
serves the Debian install howto also mentions that linux can read a floppy
when the BIOS sometimes cannot boot from it.  Perhaps this is only a
problem on old macs, but it seems like good advice in general....basically
I think a card reader that straps onto the keyboard and punches the
buttons manually would be a more reliable device than floppies :)

Hehe...that command also make me wonder what would happen to the system
load if you typed dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null :)  Sort of like
watch -n 0 ps.

anyway....

Hylafax, while it was a pain to get setup correctly (at least it was for
me five years ago), seems to work well, including acting as a network
server for outbound faxes from various user workstations.  I've never
tried some of what you want, but I believe that the multiple fax line and
printer setup you describe should not be a problem (personally, I have it
convert the faxes to emails and never bother to print them).  As far as
Windows boxes interfacing to it, there is a program "w2hfax" on source
forge which is supposed to be a Windows client for hylafax, but I've
never tried it.

I was going to rant, but have decided not to.
Install Slackware and let me know how you like it - I don't think you 
will be disapointed.

I needed to setup NFS on a box just so I could put slackware on my 
laptop, it is worth the "trouble".

There is an unofficial FTP install disk available at ftp.eunet.be
(/pub/linux/slackware/jph, I *think*) that utilizes the ftpfs module to
install via a pre-mounted directory.

I've done three or four installs with it.  It works very well.  :-)

For me, it is.  Mandrake wouldn't install on my system.  So I installed
Slackware on the advice of a friend.  I haven't looked back.

If you're really used to Mandrake, though, you might be in for a little
bit of a shock.  Slackware is *not* like Mandrake.  You have to do most
things by yourself without the aid of a graphical program (like
linuxconfig).  Generally, if you want to change a setting, it's just a
matter of a quick google to find the name of the config file then edit
it.  If you don't currently know how to use any command-line editors (a
must in Slackware) you'll want to find one that works.  Install the PINE
packages and you'll get pico, a super-easy one (^ means hold down CTRL).

If you want a install-and-use desktop distro where you don't want to
learn how to change things... you just want to use it... then Slackware
probably isn't for you (although with 8.1, X should work
out-of-the-box).  Slackware (IMHO) is the best distro to learn about
*nix in.

Slackware uses the BSD-style init scheme primarily, although there is
support for SystemV style inits.  You aren't stuck using one or the
other.  This means the /etc/rc.d directory contains just a few scripts
(maybe ten) that start up your system.

If you want to install a program, *do not* use an RPM (although RPM
tools are provided for extreme cases).  Compiling it from source is *the
best* way to do it.  Precompiled packages are available at
linuxpackages.net.

Overall, Slackware is a lot simpler than any of the other distros like
RH or Mandrake.  It does make you learn and better understand what
you're doing... but once you get the hang of it you'll start seeing just
how simple things are.  Hard?  sure.  But not complicated.

Be sure and read The Book if you get stuck (www.slackware.com/book,
available in downloadable form in ftp.eunet.be [/pub/linux/slackware/jph
I think] if you'd rather have it local on your system).  Rute
(rute.sourceforge.net) is another good asset... and Google is always
your friend.

Oh, and if your system doesn't boot the CD, look for BIOS upgrades.  8.1
doesn't use floppy emulation to boot the CD and many lower-quality
BIOS's simply don't work with it.

Good luck!  Hopefully you won't turn back.  :-)

It's probably a must for every Linux distribution on the planet. GUI 
tools will (sometimes) do the right thing for some basic system 
configuration files, but sooner or later -- probably sooner -- a Linux 
user will need a text editor.

Rob's suggestion of pico is good, but if you edit config files, make 
sure you do 'pico -w' to disable word wrapping.

Every editor has its proponents -- vi, emacs, joe, &c. In fact, 
choosing among them is the basic Unix flame war (now that SysV v. BSD 
is dead :-).

There's something to be said, however, for learning at least basic
editing with vi. It's shipped with every Linux distro and Unix
variation on the planet. It may not be your Favorite Editor; it may be
nothing but your editor of Last Resort, but it'll be on the system.

A basic, no-frills Debian system includes vi (actually nvi via a 
symlink), but no emacs or pico. Same thing with Red Hat and, 
evidently, Slackware.

Like it or not, it's pretty senseless not to know it at some level.

thanks for the advice...
I'm vi-friendly...emacs friendly.
I was more interested in just the actual stablity was that far superior to
mandrake that I should reinstall my system with slackware rather then use
mandrake again.
I'd almost consider debian, if I had download the ISO for it today and not
slackware.

I would like to take more control over my system...which is my initial
desire for slackware. Using mandrakes tools make me lazy, and I find myself
trying to use their gui for config stuff. (bad habits are hard to break)

thanks for the tips..

Glad to hear that. I strive towards that goal myself.  But I think I lean
more towards emacs in practice :)

Stability truely comes from within...err the kernel I mean.  If you have
decent hardware the choice of distro shouldn't matter too much, when it
comes to stability.  With one obvious exception, if Mandrake is packaging
a lot of unstable (read development version) software then it might be
frustrating.  This is another reason to use Debian.  Debian maintains 3
branches, stable, unstable, and testing.  Along with security updates.

Debian has some neat features, apt is really quite nice for automating the
process of locating a compatible version of libraries and installing them.
For example, on a Debian system it is no problem upgrading your version of
libc.  Try that manually and it's very hard.  I doubt Debian is alone in
that feature, I'm sure RH has something very similar these days.

If control is your thing then you will find either Debian or slackware to
be quite rewarding.  Slackware in my experience is very good on older
machines that don't have the bells and whistles.

Good luck.

I agree with ya there.  However, a lot of linux users have gone a long
time without ever seeing one.  I have one friend who plays with Linux
from time to time (RH, Mandrake, and some of the less popular
Mandrake-like clones... Lycoris and the like) and has *never* used a
command line editor.

Mandrake sets up X for you, so you really could get by without a command
line editoor until it breaks.  lol  :-)

Excellent idea.  I had to work around that darned wordwrapping a few
times.

So says you!  Every now and then you'll get a SysV vs BSD thread going
somewhere in usenet... I've seen a few in alt.os.linux.slackware!

And you can't spell evil without vi.  <g>

Yeah, I tried to use debian as a bootstrap for the creation of LFS.  I
was kinda shocked at the way it worked.  Totally different, from install
to use.

I ended up grabbing nano.  A Pico clone that's even easier to use (and
compile).  :-)

I figured that would be the primary object, and would actually be interested
in trying on slackware for size myself someday. (Speaking as a debian
addict. :)  I want to give gentoo a go sometime, too.

I set up a single line in-bound only fax on a Linux box ( file and print 
server ) using mgetty+sendfax.  I tryed HylaFAX but it was way too picky 
about modems it liked or would work with.  Heck even slightly 
different models were giving folks the fits.  Came down to a pretty 
expensive FAX modem was what worked the best.
   The Mgetty+sendfax was much less picky.  Ended up using a USR (3COM) 
internal for receiving FAXes.  They seems to be lots of options but at the 
time trying to get G3 to a printer wasn't a resonable solution.  And the 
truth of the matter is they only wanted to view the FAX and maybe pick a 
couple of pieces of information off it.  So I ended up dropping them in a 
temporary area and having a WinPopUp message sent to the two people that 
normally checked the FAX machine.  They used some MS Windows program to 
view them in whatever format they were coming in as and would print print 
if they really wanted a hardcopy.  Lots of other options come to mind but 
it was a low-hanging-fruit solution they liked.

Sending is another deal.  I'm looking at a really simple solution called 
lprfax.  Once my iDSL line comes in I'll be able to play with it.  Not 
sure if it scales to multiple FAX lines.  The copy says it works using the 
print spooler and there are clients for Windows (and MACs?).

will be of course performance hits due to the level of abstraction.

So I was curious if anyone has used it and what they thought of it?

Back in 1994/1995, I attended a presentation about the Hurd at the
(now defunct) Portland Unix Users Group. From what I remembered, getting
the GNU Hurd to work then (at least) was a tricky, hard process. Very
bleeding-edge, & requiring you to search all over the Internet for
patches.

IIRC, the guy who gave the presentation either worked or studied at
PSU. Someone there might still know something of how this implementation
worked out.

Hopefully things have improved since then, but I get the impression
that this is still a difficult project due to the architecture, &
not something you can get working in a weekend.

One of these days I'm going to break down and get the Hurd running.

I think the most painless first step would be to try the Debian route:
<URL: http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-install >

Personally, I can't wait to be rid of Linux and have a Free operating
system without all the compromises.

  That's interesting, Paul. I read recently (but I don't recall just where)
that the final slash is required. If we don't put it in, the browser is
supposed to do it for us. There's a reason for having it there, but that is
in the same region of lost memory as the source of the article.

Non-canonical URLs cause a redirect to create a canonical URL (one that can
serve as a base for future requests). This is an unnecessary load on the
server. That's why http://foo.com/bar/ is preferred over http://foo.com/bar
- just what Google is doing is a puzzle. For more info, see...

I was wondering about this too. Glad I live in a world where I don't feel
like I'm morally comprimising myself by using Linux.

One way to check if your ISP's mail is bloogered is to look at the
NNTP server.  Another way is to disguise your test message with some
relevant-seeming content.

RMS pointed out some problems with Linux:

"The Linux sources themselves have an even more serious problem with
non-free software: they actually contain some. Quite a few device drivers
contain series of numbers that represent firmware programs to be installed
in the device. These programs are not free software. A few numbers to be
deposited into device registers are one thing; a substantial program in
binary is another.

The presence of these binary-only programs in "source" files of Linux
creates a secondary problem: it calls into question whether Linux binaries
can legally be redistributed at all. The GPL requires "complete
corresponding source code," and a sequence of integers is not the source
code. By the same token, adding such a binary to the Linux sources
violates the GPL."
...
"Linux, the kernel, is often thought of as the flagship of free software,
yet its current version is partially non-free. How did this happen? This
problem, like the decision to use Bitkeeper, reflects the attitude of the
original developer of Linux, a person who thinks that "technically better"
is more important than freedom."

http://www.linuxworld.com/site-stories/2002/0520.rms-p2.html

RMS refers to Linus Torvald's preference for Bitkeeper, a proprietary
version control system. Because of this preference, developers have to use
proprietary software to track kernel revisions and participate closely in
kernel development.

GNU's Not Unix!

http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html
The GNU Hurd is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel

http://www.pdxlinux.org/
We are a group of enthusiasts dedicated to teaching and learning about Linux
and Unix.


Let's string these three things together; GNU Hurd is the GNU project's
replacement for the Unix kernel, GNU's Not Unix, [ and PLUG is ] dedicated to
teaching and learning about Linux and Unix. 

Hurd is not Linux, so it seems that once you have freed yourself, you'll need
to find another group to encougage you to new heights. 

Do you need help downloading the iso? ; -)


Thank you
Russell

There's no puzzle at all.

The "linux" portion of <URL: http://www.google.com/linux > is not the name
of a directory.  It is the name of a CGI program.

When you add a trailing slash, you're telling the http server that you are
looking for a directory.  Many web servers are configured to either show
directory contents or choose some particular file in that directory as the
default to display when no file is specified.  In this case, there is no
directory called linux, so you're given an error.

Note the following URL:
<URL: http://www.google.com/linux?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&safe=off&q=foo >

See how the command line arguments are passed to the linux program rather
than some "index.cgi" or whatever in a directory called "linux".

If we're going to take this strict and narrow focus (and I'm all for
strict focus), then we should mark all discussion of the GNU system as
off-topic until such time as this group extends its focus beyond Unix (the
proprietary operating system family) and Linux (the unix workalike kernel
and associated very small handful of utilities).

Of course, for practical reasons, we should simply note the relationship
(and interrelationships) between these things and refocus the group in a
way that encompasses the GNU system even though it is not Unix or Linux.

I'm a proponent of rewriting our group description to correct the
situation (since our group already encourages use and discussion of the
GNU system despite the failure to recognize that in group description or
name) and become PUGLUG: Portland Unix-GNU-Linux User's Group.

Toward this end, I would be happy to donate the domain puglug.org to the
group as soon as the change is made.

> Do you need help downloading the iso? ; -)

I don't install pre-built binaries.

You will have a group that will be so much better.

your posts to PUGLUG, to the plug list? We don't want anyone undermining the

Here are some quotes I found from kernel developers, one is a Hurd
developer, the other one works on some other kernel you may have heard of
:)

"We're way ahead of you here. The Hurd has always been on the cutting edge
of not being good for anything." (Roland McGrath)

"In short: just say NO TO DRUGS, and maybe you won't end up like the Hurd
people." (Linus Torvalds)


So at least the Hurd developers have a sense of humor...about themselves
(I grabbed the quotes from their own documenation).

I wrote that and would gladly re-write it to reflect shifting priorities.

PLUG is not dedicate exclusively to Linux and would happily embrace other 
kernels.

You make some good points but I believe that the group is already de facto 
not just focused on Linux. But making such an inclusiveness more explicit 
would be a good thing.

Now, what you are suggesting is more of a fork which should be avoided if

I have to agree with Jeme in many ways on this -- it wouldn't hurt to
expand PLUG's charter to more accurately reflect what it's all about.

No doubt a lot of PLUGGers express some disdain for the ideological side
of free software, and resent efforts to expand names to include "GNU". But
if you think about it, describing your operating system just as "Linux"
isn't very accurate: someone could swap a FreeBSD kernel into my operating
system and I probably wouldn't notice the difference. The tools with which
I interact; gcc, bash, vim, emacs, tar, gzip, have little to do with Linux.

Sure, not all, not most, and perhaps even not the most important aspects
of a free software system are GNU tools, but such a system generally
meets the goals of the GNU project. Just like back in the day
computers used to be called IBM-clones without actually being IBM, I call
my system Debian GNU/Linux because it was essentially inspired by the GNU
project.

Anyway, here's one vote for PUGLUG aka PLUG, or at least expanding the
group description. :)

A fork of one is status quo, well not quite, it would be a quieter list.

to set up the network and systems.  Are they looking for more volunteers,
and what kind of volunteers?

I hadn't heard that.

Glad they are.

With their budget 'issues' ... it'd be nice if they could stop paying
the Microsoft Tax.

My local school just bought a truckload of new PCs.  I haven't seen 'em,
but my money is on Win2K/WinXP with Office XP pre-loaded, including
Access.

Okay. I've been working on this for a while now.  I'm trying to set up
printer that is connected to a Windows XP machine through a SMB
connection on a RedHat 7.3 computer.  I have shared the printer and
input the correct information in printconf.  After saving the changes
and restarting lpd, I try testing the printer and I get a non descript
error message "There was an error trying to print the test page."

I have tried restarting the service from a command line (service lpd
restart) and when I do, I get a failed notice when stopping lpd and the
starting lpd message goes as follows: [timestamp] linux Get_local_host:
'localhost' IP address not available!  But after that I get the green
okay indicating that lpd started okay.

I'm at a loss.  Any suggestions?

It may have nothing to do with RH. I was trying to connect from an XP to a 98 
and ran into essentially the same problem. I could add the printer and 
configure it (in fact I did two different printers), but when I tried to 
print a test page  I got some weird error like "Could not open ...". If you 
do a network nbrhd does the XP show itself as part of group. Ours didn't.

I haven't set up printing from a linux to win box before, but SAMBA 
lots of times.  If the win box is running 2000 or XP, it uses encrypted
passwords (always a good idea), and you may have to explicitly set
that in the configuration.  This is the case with SAMBA, I would 
imagine it is the same when using remote printers as files.

Just something to look into, it may not be the problem :)

My printer does not show up in My Network Places on my Windows PC.  That
fact had crossed my mind, that perhaps XP is not sharing the printer
properly.  I thought about trying it through another windows computer,
but don't have one right now.

Hi,

Open source is alive and well at PPS and efforts are underway. The
immediate project at PPS is to setup a computer lab with Linux.  Hardware
from STRUT is being refurbished and Linux installed by volunteer interns
from PCC (STRUT - Students Recycling Used Technology - basically a
warehouse of corporate castoff PCs available to K-14).  The PCC contact for
PCC students applying for internships is Terry Arnold, tarnold at pcc.edu and
the project manager at PPS is Gail Lamarra, glamarra at pps.k12.or.us 

Interns are needed for:
* hardware/software and network set-up (recruiting students who have
completed at least 2 networking classes) 
* research (recruiting students who will research solutions to identify
technology problems)
* documentation (recruiting students who have completed the tech writing
class)
* training of teachers and users of Linux (recruiting students people who
like to teach)

The first lab to go in using PCC students is July 29th between 9 and 4 at
Binnsmead Middle School, 2225 S.E. 87th. The next project is to convert a
different school to 100% Linux as a test. 

Cheers,
Mike Neal

Are there projects at PPS to install cross-platform products such as
OpenOffice, Netscape/Mozilla, Gimp, etc., on the existing Windows boxes?
If a Windows user is familiar with apps such as OpenOffice, then switching
them to Linux in the future would be less of a struggle.
In fact, I challenge each and every one of you on this list to give out
and help setup OpenOffice on at least 5 friends/family Windows computers.
90% of users out there can work quite happily in OpenOffice and save a lot
of money too.  Alright, everyone knows the drill.  Now move out soldiers!
Move!  MOVE!!  MOVE!!  I want all of Oregon running OpenOffice by the end
of the week or you'll be cleaning the K-12 bathrooms with your
toothbrush!!  NOW MOVE!!

Is the printer shared from XP?
Can you ping the printer system by name?

Win XP Home or Win XP Pro?  The reports I'm hearing is Home is a bugger to
get to work on a network.  I only have Win 2K (part-time) system right now
and haven't had to deal with XP yet but I'm willing to bet if it isn't a
Home vs. Pro issue it's a permissions thing.

Could you post the lines from your printcap file that apply to this SMB 
printer.  and the .config file from the printers lpd directory: such as

	/var/spool/lpd/hp870cxi/.config

After days of trying to do this myself, I've realized I'm in over my

Linux 7.3.  It's mostly set up, but I need some troubleshooting done on
the router (Cisco 678) or some other configuration settings.  If anyone
on this list is very familiar with DSL configuration and the Cisco 678,
I would be happy to compensate you for your time.  I'm in the Hawthorne

On a related note, PLUG is down to one DNS server and one mail server.
Any failure will cripple us. My server used to be a secondary DNS until
I didn't agree to use BIND 9 (I use Tinydns and BIND 8). I guess the
thinking was no secondary is better than a non-BIND 9 server. Can
someone who does run BIND 9 volunteer to be a secondary so we'll
not be victim to any failure?

Subject: [PLUG] Windows versus Linux security
Message-ID: <1027286852.1750.132.camel@red>

I'm on an author-oriented mailing list, where most people on the
list are authors, publishers, and agents. Recently, an author
pointed out an article that says that Windows is more secure than
Linux because Linux has more security issues than Windows. People
on the mailing list then discussed the issues from the point
of view that the underlying premise was largely correct. I
responded like this:


I'm surprised that this thread has gone so far without someone
pointing out that this is simply a numbers game that is far
from useful. There's a fundamental difference between Microsoft
and Open Source/Linux security issues. The majority of Windows
security issues are holes that have have already been exploited
by the bad guys - there were real victims who reported the
problem. The majority of Open Source/Linux security issues were
discovered by the Open Source community and reported before they
were exploited and before there were victims.

Simply comparing the number of security issues between the two
is unfair and counterproductive. You're punishing the people
who are concerned about security and who are making an effort
to fix problems before they affect the user population. The Open
Source community operates in plain view of everyone and acts
responsibly by warning us when potential security problems exist.
This numbers game may drive some of these people to covert
channels of communications to improve the numbers for "their
side".

I think it's fair to say that there are far more serious
security holes in Microsoft software than in Open Source
software. I know of no Apache security hole that will produce
Code Red or Nimda-like results. I've never received email from
a Linux user who fell victim to an email-borne attack that
resulted in personal or confidential documents sent to everyone
in the user's address book. One Nimda does not equal one
Open Source "potential security hole".

When certain Open Source software gains a reputation for security
problems, more secure replacements are developed and released.
If, for example, you're running sendmail and you want better
security, you can easily switch to Postfix, Exim, or qmail (they're
drop-in replacements). If you're weary of keeping BIND 9 updated,
you can switch to Tinydns. In the Microsoft world, you frequently
have no alternatives - security solutions must come from Microsoft
- a company whose own web site was taken down twice by elementary
external attacks and once by their own incompetence (all of
their DNS servers on the same subnet).

If you're going to play a silly numbers game, at least make it
fair. Either don't count security issues where there were no
victims or assign a weight to each. For example, a Nimda would
be a 10 but a "potential security hole" that was reported before
real users fell victim would be a one. Also, give more points to
those problems where no secure alternative exists.

Better yet, let's not play the game at all.

And don't they count security problems differently between Windows and 
Linux? For Windows there's only one count per problem but don't they 
count each vulnerability separately for each Linux distro out there? I 
seem to recall seeing some numbers like that. I guess counting by 
distro is OK if a give version of a distro has a problem that no other 
distros have.

Aside from the inherent invalidity of simply comparing the "number of
vulnerabilities by OS" is the fact that, even according to
SecurityFocus's own vulnerability statistics page they explain, in large
type at the very top of the page that:
  * There is a distinct difference in the way that vulnerabilities are
    counted for Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. For
    instance, applications for Linux and BSD are often grouped in as
    subcomponents with the operating systems that they are shipped with.
    For Windows, applications and subcomponents such as Explorer often
    have their own packages that are considered vulnerable or not
    vulnerable outside of Windows and therefore may not be included in
    the count. This may skew numbers.

Basically, a BIND or Sendmail vulnerability gets added to any Linux
distribution that ships it (regardless of whether it is installed by
default, or another program, say postfix, is the "preferred" solution,
or what have you) whereas security problems with some of Windows core
components may NOT be counted as vulnerabilities for that platform.
"This may skew numbers" is an understatement, making any and all
discussion of vulnerabilities based solely on number wholly inaccurate
and patently absurd.  Unless you do the counting fairly for every
platform, you cannot get any meaningful data out of them.  Additionally,
you can point out that using these numbers and rationale that Mac OS X
Server (or Mac OS in general) is the most secure "popular" operating
system and see how they react.

  Would a fair metric be the number of virii and worms attacking systems?
How many e-mail virii are there known to be for each OS? What about worms?
How about calculating response and patch time delays?

I think the fairest metric is the actual damage done. Measured in dollars, 
time, and aggravation, Microsoft is the undisputed world champeen.

Wow, that is incredible. Is there any effort to standardize reporting so 
that apples get compared to apples in the counting?

The only problem is how would you calculate that? It would be a monumental 
task for each vulnerability and somewhat subjective also.

My feeling is there should be a way to compare apples to apples if that is

vi and pico are probably the two most popular. Pico is the easiest but has 
a bad rap because it has limited capabilities beyond very simple editing.

To be fair, it would also have to be weighted to factor into the metrics the
number of servers installed for each OS - or the market cap of the companies
affected.

Oh, I don't think it's that complicated. Total dollars tell the story quite 
accurately. For example, how much money did Nimda cost? How much money has 
any Linux, Unix, or BSD virus cost? That's the bottom line- how much has a 
particular vulnerability cost the users? If you really want to go nuts, 
calculate how much it cost the economy in lost productivity, sales, 
additional labor, diverted resources, etc. But simply calculating actual 
direct damages isn't that difficult, and certainly tells a compelling story.

Then compare how catastrophic individual vulnerabilities are, as Ed was 
saying. What happens when, say, a new vulnerability is discovered in Apache, 
and it is actually exploited? Certainly nothing like Code Red or Nimda. I 
can't recall anything in the past few years that even came close. 

Meaningful comparisons are easy, if a person really wants to make them. Most 
of the articles discussing this topic are not interested in meaningful 
analysis, they're just parroting the first person who did a count on bugtraq 
two years ago.

  joe, vim, and about a dozen others. Go to freshmeat.net and search for
'editor'. In emacs running on a consle, ESC ` will take you to the menus.
Actually, it presents the menu choices in a window and you work from there.

As an economic study it would be fantastic but it would take a fair bit of 
research resources. As a day-to-day reporting of security vulnerabilities 
I am not so sure it would be practical.

As an economic study it would be fascinating to know what those numbers 
are an how they influence the TCO numbers. Truelly fascinating it would 
be.

And Stephen, just to clarify, 'vim' is the 'Vi IMproved' which you 
probably want to use rather than just plain ol' vi. :-)

similar subject, but different.  I was able to configure the Cisco 678
for Qwest's DSL, but Covad's setup for DSL has proven to be trickier.
actually with Qwest I cheated: I configured the 678 with a Windows box
running Commander, which doesn't work this time around, so I'm only
using linux.

Also with vim, disabling the vi compatibility mode makes it a little
easier to use (unless you're just a hard-core vi purist).  Add this line
to your ~/.vimrc:

set nocompatible

I disagree, Carla - the reason being market penetration. If the roles were
reversed (i.e. linux had the predominance now enjoyed by M$), then the total
dollar impact of nimda, et al. would be far less. A mite in the eye of M$
OS's tends to hurt more users than a root exploit in linux. The original
point that the numbers games is BS due to impact vs. early warning is spot
on. I simply don't want to see the linux community err in our favor by
similarly skewed logic. Measuring the injury in dollars per CPU for each OS
(if that's even possible) would, I'd venture to guess, still paint a very
rosy picture for linux. And it would level the metrics field WRT market
share.

Stephen,

  Below is a copy of ~/.emacs. They're always a work in progress and readily
shared among users. I like the same appearance of emacs whether it's running
on a console or in a virtual terminal during an X session. Take what works

  Look in your home directory. It's an individual user's resource

It's an optional file - Vim will use it if it's there, but it's not
something that's installed.  Each user needs to create their own.

It may need to be created.  On SuSe, root doesn't have a .vimrc either. 
  I'm not sure if regular users have one created by default.

On SuSe, there is an example vimrc at:
/usr/share/vim/current/vimrc_example.vim
which might be more than Stephen needs.

Stephen, you could just create your .vimrc with the options that people 
suggested.

Sandy,

  So, how to account for multiple-cpu boxes running with a single
installation of an OS?

  IMO, this is all a tempest in a teapot; asking the wrong question so we'll
always come up with the wrong answer. I suggest a more correct question to
ask is: What are the real effects of software bugs?

  All software, with the possible exception of TeX, have bugs. And security
flaws because of the almost-infinite variety of hardware and network
configurations on which they run. With linux and the other open source OSes,
such vulnerabilities are frequently identified before they are maliciously
exploited and, in all cases, are very quickly repaired with the patches
widely distributed. With Microsoft, it appears that denial and shifting of
blame is the common response and it occurs only after malicious exploitation
in the majority of cases. Then the patch is made available for application.

  The unmeasured -- and unmeasurable -- factor in all this is the System
Administrator. I've read numerous times on this mail list how clueless and
indifferent to security Microsoft sysadmins can be. Perhaps because those
running unices -- including linux -- tend to be more interested and detail
oriented, these sysadmins are both more security conscious and quick to
apply all patches. Of course, there are exceptions to both camps, but I
think the stereotype holds. Quickly identifying the cause of an exploit and
quickly fixing the problem and applying the fix is much more important than
anything else.

On most Linux systems, 'vi' is a symbolic link to some version of Vim.

by the way, here's a sample .vimrc:

Subject: [PLUG] Please look at http://new.pdxlinux.org

Using as a start the design given by the (static) design demonstration
pages you'll find at:

  http://people.pdxlinux.org/~pacopablo/

... I've created my rendition of the PLUG website, which you may view
at:

  http://new.pdxlinux.org/

Please check it with various browsers and provide the web team with
feedback in the "plug-web" mailing list.

It is done with HTML::Mason running in mod_perl:

  http://www.masonhq.com
  http://perl.apache.org

... which I find to be a superior platform to PHP.  The page sources and
the sources to the Perl modules used by them are in the "website" and
"PLUG" modules of cvs.pdxlinux.org (you may use the viewcvs interface to
take a quick look by accessing it with your web browser).

The httpd.conf file will be copied each day to
http://people.pdxlinux.org/~karlheg/apache/ for anyone interested in
seeing how the pdxlinux.org web server is configured.  In particular,
you may be interested in how I've use mod_macro to create virtual hosts
for which there is a secure part as well as an unencrypted part, and in
how I use mod_rewrite to affect redirection that ensures that things
that need to be secured are served only from the secured side.

The site is obviously not done yet.  The code that generates the
calendar is just a static stub.  At some point, it will use a database
backend, and may even be vCalendar capable.  That should be an
interesting challenge!  The search engine is working; it uses ht://Dig.

I has some trouble with ht://Dig; it does not know how to ungzip .txt.gz
files, so I used mod_rewrite and mod_action to make the server ungzip
the stream for "htdig/".  I then removed the ".gz" extension from the
ignored extensions list, and now it has indexed all of the .txt.gz and
.html.gz files on the server, including the RFC's.  Our mailing list
archives are also indexed now, along with all of the documentation on
the machine.  The set of files indexed is very large, since it includes
the Linux HOWTO's, Internet RFC's, and every software documentation
package in Debian, plus our mailing list archives.

I'm not completely satisfied with ht://Dig.  This morning while the
cron.daily script was running the htdig indexer -- it's second run since
I'd run it last night -- I ran a "tail -f /etc/apache/access.log | grep
'htdig/3'" and watched it for a moment.  The server is sending "200"
responses, which indicates that ht://Dig is NOT using the
"If-Modified-Since" mechanism -- if it was, the server would respond
with "304 Not Modified".  This means that it reindexes the entire set
each and every day, rather than just maintaining an already created
index.  It's doing a lot more work than it should have to.

This is a good point. People will argue that more money is lost due to
Microsoft security holes because it's the more popular software. But
what about Microsoft security problems, like Nimda and Code Red, where
there is no equivalent Linux security problem? Why not use the real
loss (in dollars) when the amount is zero for Linux?

Try Swish-e:

and use the sample provided spider, swishspider.pl.  It's all written

  Since Bob Morris's famous 'Net worm from 1986(?), has there been a virus
or worm that's caused outages, disruptions and monetary loss that wasn't a
Microsoft virus or worm?

Dollars might make a good metric, but using gross amounts do not, it needs
to be normalized in some manner, so a much better approach would be
something like dollars lost per user hour of usage, though even this is
not without problems, since different types of usage will alter both
patterns of stability and degree of vulnerability, after all is it a fair
comparison when one computer is never connected to the net or used for
email, while another is connected 24/7, and acts as a web server, email
router, database server and user workstation all at once?  Ultimately, I
think to get a truly fair comparison would require much more fine grained
metrics such as: cost per million characters of word processing, cost per
web page hit, cost per database transaction, cost per email received,
etc..  We all have a pretty good idea of what Microsoft's level of quality
is, but to have credibility when discussing it, the numbers must be
honest, or we shouldn't be using them, otherwise we are just as bad as the
marketing drones who create fictional numbers to try and prove that
Microsoft products are superior to Linux.

It is all too arbitrary, including the money metric.

There has to be a standardized, easy to measure metric. That is the only 
way it will be credible. It must be simple and not subject to much 
"interpretation".

Again, as an economic study measuring the economic costs of security 
vulnerabilities would be fantastic.

Fixed it finally!

I had to recompile the kernel setting jiffies=100
instead of 1000. And also I had to disable the system
sleep timer in the BIOS. Never had an issue with this
when I was running mdk so I didn't think that apm had
anything to do with it. Tested it out after and
confirmed my findings though.

Thanks for all the help!

But like Sandy said, you need to scale that by something that
represents breadth of use.  I would suggest a measure of "utility",
that is, a measure of how much productivity is acheived by using the
software in the face of its vulnerabilities.  You want a measure
comparing risk to benefit.  As a decision maker, you needn't concern
yourself with all the money/opportunity other people are losing, but
just the effect a decision will have on your own activity.  For that,
you need a scaled estimate.

You might think this would weaken the indictment, but having just
spent a few weeks doing battle with MS (multiple sclerosis?) software,
I am inclined to think it is more like "piling on".

I saw four or five different Linux worms in the past, 
but they were usually written for particular 
vulnerabilities and often would even depend on how the 
system had been installed.  One worm would only 
propagate with Redhat installed as one partition.

The big difference between the Windows and Unix attacks 
are that the Unix vulnerablities are usually a 
programming mistake, while Windows starts from a design 
mistake. Ok, that's a bit of a biased view, but that 
does make the Unix problems easier to fix.

I think Unix was helped tremendously by having BSD on 
many college campuses in the 80's.  There were all sorts 
of problems pointed out by rogue programs. (Hmm, what 
happens if I just fork recursivily...)

Message-ID: <3D3C724B.6452F617@attbi.com>

Some months ago I reported on the purchase of a used Planar C3013T
computer (http://plug.skylab.org/200201/msg00170.html). Well, one day
the thing decided to simply not power up anymore. Turn on the switch --
nothing. I've checked the power supply, and it is putting out + and - 12
VDC, just like the label says, but nothing happens on the unit itself.
So anyway, I called Planar to see if they could direct me to someone who
could service the thing. They said that they no longer service it, and
sold all their inventory to somebody called Derf in New York, and that
they (Planar) didn't know anyone locally who could work on the unit.

I checked out Derf on the web and found out that they buy and sell
inventory. I've sent them an e-mail, but I'm not hopeful.

Next, I decided to do a Google search on Planar 3013T. I got 8 hits!
Unfortunately, they were both archives of e-mails I had sent to the PLUG
list and the related replies! Sigh.

I remember reading some recommended service houses on this list in the
last couple of months. I'll check the archives and see if one of those
places can work on this thing.

I hadn't remembered that. I did have the case open a few months ago and
noticed that Radisys was the motherboard manufacturer. Thanks for
reminding me. I'll give that a try.

I know everyone else on the list guffas at this, but I still like
Midnight commander, and its editor: mcedit.  I have found it on all
distro's that I've looked at, it is easy to figure out how to do basic
editing, and it meets the most important requirement: it works. Other
nice features: it never adds extra characters, it never changes
formating, the mouse is useful (but not necessary) and you only need to
hit one key to exit (two if it has been modified).

I don't know if xmms will do it.  That would be great.  Especially if it
has a graphical plugin so that you can watch realplayer clips too.

There is a version of realplayer that you can download and install in
linux.  It isn't free as in speech, but the download doesn't cost
anything.  If you can't find the binary on google then I might be able to
send it to you.  Note that it is very hard to locate on their website.  I
recommend finding it on www.google.com/linux

I figured out what was wrong.

Had NOTHING to do with Gnome2.

Had everything to do with XkbLayout in XF86Config set to "us_intl"
instead of "us".

all,

I'm would like to move an external HP drive from our HP box to our linux
box.  I looked in the known partitions in fdisk on linux and didn't see
hpux mentioned.  Does fdisk support the hpux format?  Can I just take the
drive and hook it to the linux box and have it read the format correctly? 
I was told the hpux format is vxfs.  I didn't see that in the known
partition types.
Thanks for the help.

Josh

btw, this is a RH 7.2 box if that matters.

apt-get install kernel-internals-guide?

You might try finding a book that teaches unix.  I have one called "Unix
for Programmers and Users" that describes things pretty well.  It teaches
how to use csh, bash, perl and a few others at the basic level.  How to
use system calls when programming and gives the concepts behind the
filesystem, scheduler and networking.  Not enough technical detail if you
want to be an administrator, but it is good for giving people an
introduction to unix operating systems, and gives tips for deciphering man
pages.

If you are interested, I can send you the ISBN of the book.  I don't have
it with me, but it is smallish blue book.  The cover has a web browser on
it.

HTH,
Jason

Josh:

I don't think your chances are good.  HP uses the Veritas filesystem
(vxfs) by default.  Although there is a "freevxfs" driver in the kernel
(2.4.9) I don't know how stable it is.

HP includes by default a proprietary logical volume manager (LVM) which to
my knowledge has not been reverse-engineered.  The best you can hope for
is to find out the general header structure so that you can "dd" the data
off the disk and try to get the Veritas filesystem to mount this image
over a loopback device.

You might be able to hack something that searches the raw disk for a valid
vxfs superblock and tries different offsets until the filesystem looks
"sane".  But that's a lot of work.

It's going to be easier to just copy the data from the HP system to the
Linux system.

As far as distro-agnostic texts go, Running Linux is pretty good.

A great book for Debian is "Debian Unleashed", it covers quite a
lot, many topics are very in depth.  The only Red Hat book I've 
looked at is "Linux Administration: A Beginner's Guide".  If you're 
running Red Hat, and a beginner, it really can't be beat.  It's pretty
light if you have much experience with UNIX at all, but from the
sounds of it it might be a good fit.

Hope this helps :)

What this all really boils down to as a practical exercise (as opposed to an
academic analysis) is how do we convince the guys in suits (CEOs/CIOs) of
the cost/benefit in using linux vs. windows in their enterprise? They're not
interested in numbers of virii, or how sysadmins see the issue. They want to
know how much it's going to cost them to stay with the status quo, what is
the cost of switching, and how much money will they save if they do switch.

And no, I have no idea how to arrive at those answers.

Dave,

  Yes, there are a lot of distribution-specific books out there and others
on system and network administration (Marcel Gagne's book is particularly
good, by the way), but too few that give a broad overview.

  I understand that my favorite is no longer in print (after a couple of
years!), but the library or a used book store should be able to get a copy
for you. It's Phil Cornes' "Linux A-Z" and is based on his English
university course in operating systems. He covers a lot of the same topics
as everyone else, but he puts in a lot of the why; just what you're seeking.

  Highly recommended.

Rich

Thanks.  That is what I was about to decide.  I think I'll just build the
linux file server and copy the directories over.  Then I'm going to build
another linux file server to use as a cheap HD backup until we get the
multi tape drive up and running.
Thanks for the detail info.

Hi Derek

Thanks for your advice.

I use MC frequently for files transfer only.  It is a convenient tools.  I 
will try to use it for basic editing which is I need in Console window.

I'm looking for a simple application to draw state diagrams

ovals, and arrows - and output it as jpeg or gif. A search
turns up "too many possibilites" and I was hoping to get
some recommendations to start with.

I discover some files with "rc" at their end, such as "abcrc", "defghrc", 
"ijklmnrc".  What are those files used for ?

  Views on Linux in Business

  --by Doc Searls, Senior Editor of Linux Journal
     _________________________________________________________________

                            "Karmic Adjustments"

   Thursday, June 27--Here at Linux Journal we often half-joke about the
   years remaining before we finish working off our "Microsoft-bashing
   karma". (Bashing Microsoft is so last millennium, y'know?) That means
   the trick is to talk about Our Friends from Redmond in an objective
   way, which is easier these days because Microsoft looms progressively
   smaller as a dominant force. (See, I didn't bash. We're talking facts
   here.)

   For perspective, let's remember what life with IBM was like when that
   company's influence was at high ebb--a period that lasted through most
   of computing's history. Those of us old enough to remember can recall
   referring to Big Blue simply as "the environment". In those days you
   either lived as fleas in the fur of the great blue beast or you were,
   so to speak, out in the cold.

   What's interesting from today's perspective is not that IBM
   "controlled" so much of the industry or that Microsoft later did the
   same. What's interesting is that both dominated through a long period
   when it was possible for one company to define the whole world for
   everybody else. For a century or more AT&T did the same in telephone
   communications. IBM and AT&T provided base infrastructure for
   everybody else in their industries. Even if they didn't own the iron
   or the wires, they owned and controlled countless protocols, standards
   and foundational products. Gradually that kind of hegemony wore away.
   Few of us remember when Racal-Vadic came out with the first non-"Bell"
   full duplex 1200bps modem. It may seem like a small thing today, but
   at the time it looked like a crack across a vast ice shelf. There were
   a lot of those cracks, mostly forgotten today.

   The ice age is over. What dominates now is the Internet, with an
   infrastructure that consists mostly of protocols: TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP,
   SMTP, IMAP, LDAP, FTP, Telnet, POP3 and so on. "The history of the Net
   is the history of its protocols", Vint Cerf says. These are the things
   that nobody owns, everybody can use and anybody can improve, although
   once a protocol is established, improvement tends to come in the form
   of additional protocols supporting additional services. These
   protocols are established often by quiet adoption by many companies,
   rather than by loud promotion by one company.

   In the last few days I've heard casual mention that two widely
   different companies were using the Jabber protocol for routing XML
   streams between here and there. One is Apple, which apparently will
   use the Jabber protocol (not the server, just the protocol) in its new
   iChat system. The other is Fidelia:
   http://www.fidelia.com, which does performance management for Linux
   and Solaris systems in enterprises. Neither company mentions this fact
   anywhere in its public documents (not that I can find, anyway). If
   this constitutes a trend (and I suspect it does), AOL's and
   Microsoft's instant messaging (IM) systems will inevitably find
   themselves adapting to a world where the prevailing IM protocol is one
   they don't own.

   There is no reason either company shouldn't be able to continue
   dominating the IM service business, whatever that business becomes.
   They just won't control IM infrastructure, because Jabber (or one of
   its descendents) will become the Net's primary protocol for instant
   messaging and presence detection (the protocol's other main virtue).

   As the Net grows in the number and variety of services supported by
   its basic protocols (say, wireless networking, thanks to 802.11b, and
   zero configuration networking (zeroconf):
   http://www.zeroconf.org, which will make its first major appearance in
   Apple's forthcoming Rendezvous:
   http://www.apple.com/macosx/newversion/), countless new businesses and
   market categories will be made possible. This is a good thing, even
   for dominant companies like AOL and Microsoft. The trick for these
   incumbent dominators is to play a supportive game, not a lock-in
   game--to obey the imperative best expressed by John F. Kennedy: "With
   great power comes great responsibility."

   In apparent compliance with that imperative, Microsoft has been
   expressing a need to take responsibility for security. Not long ago
   Bill Gates declared that "trustworthy computing" was Job One. This
   week that commitment bore fruit in the form of "Palladium", a "vision"
   that would, in the words of the Wall Street Journal, "Make online
   security and the protection of some Internet content a built-in
   feature of personal computers."

   The rollout was carefully orchestrated. In Newsweek and MSNBC:
   http://www.msnbc.com/news/770511.asp, Steven Levy called Palladium
   "one of the riskiest ventures the company has ever attempted. Though
   Microsoft does not claim a panacea, the system is designed to
   dramatically improve our ability to control and protect personal and
   corporate information. Even more important, Palladium is intended to
   become a new platform for a host of yet-unimagined services to enable
   privacy, commerce and entertainment in the coming decades." He adds,
   "Because its ultimate success depends on ubiquity, Palladium is either
   going to be a home run or a mortifying whiff."

   Some of the best thinking about Palladium has been coming from Eric
   Norlin at DigitalID World. In "The 282 Billion Dollar Riddle":
   http://www.digitalidworld.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=ar
   ticle&sid=72, Norlin says Microsoft's grand strategy mooshes Palladium
   together with the .NET development framework and "Trustbridge", a new
   "federated identity system for the enterprise". He says:

     As Palladium, TrustBridge and .NET come to fruition Microsoft will
     once again find themselves the OS company with an OS that isn't a
     commodity. The reason for this is an identity-based core, but -- in
     what I'm willing to proclaim a masterstroke -- Microsoft has chosen
     not to try to make *that* part of it proprietary. In other words,
     Microsoft will push hard for federated, interoperable identity.
     They will do so, while keeping some parts of Palladium, TrustBridge
     and .NET proprietary -- that is their hook. They will let identity
     be open, interoperable and flexible, and in return they will make
     sure that their OS is proprietary. It's in their best interest to
     do so from a legal and business perspective, and they know it.

   Among other places, here's where Norlin goes: "Microsoft's involvement
   with the WS-I (web services) standards group--specifically their cozy
   involvement with IBM--now makes perfect sense. IBM turns Linux into a
   pure enterprise play; Microsoft takes the "consumer" market."

   Then he makes one more point worth passing along: "Microsoft does not
   consider Liberty, Sun or anyone in identity to be competition. They
   want to intemperate with all of them."

   In fact, selective interoperability appears to be a key strategy. How?
   Well, get this: Microsoft is going to publish the Palladium source
   code. "We want to be transparent in all this", Jim Allchin says. For
   more of the rest of the story, Extreme Tech has a rather deep
   analysis.:
   http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,274309,00.asp

   Meanwhile, right next to the Palladium story in Monday's Wall Street
   Journal was a larger, above-the-fold item that was anything but good
   news: "New Microsoft Pricing Looms". The subhead said much more: "Some
   Customers Consider Switching to Rivals' Software". The larger story is
   about Microsoft's new software pricing policy, which takes effect at
   the end of July and has been anything but a PR success. Says the
   Journal:

     Because of expected price increases, some longtime customers are
     considering competing products such as the Linux operating system
     and Sun Microsystems Inc.'s StarOffice, which competes with
     Microsoft's ubiquitous Office suite of programs. The chief
     information officer of one large European financial concern who
     declined to be named for fear of raising Microsoft's ire said he
     was "70% sure" his firm would start moving its more than 30,000
     computer desktops to Linux-based software made by a company called
     Ximian Inc. instead of re-signing with Microsoft.

   Meanwhile Ximian is calling Microsoft's July 31 deadline "Y2Pay" and
   is offering customers a special deal:

     If yours is like many companies, you're facing an ominous deadline
     on July 31st. You'll have to decide whether to commit now for
     future Microsoft software upgrades you may not need or want, or
     face the prospect of higher costs for new licenses later. The
     countdown to Y2Pay is coming. What will your company do?

     You do have a choice--begin moving users to lower-cost Linux
     desktops using software and solutions from Ximian. From now through
     August 15th, you can purchase Ximian Desktop Professional Edition
     for Linux, a complete desktop environment and suite of productivity
     applications that includes Sun StarOffice 6.0 and Ximian Evolution,
     at a savings of up to 25% over the usual price.

   Any business Ximian gets out of this will be a huge boon, even if most
   Microsoft customers go ahead and sign new contracts (which is the
   default assumption). Operating systems continue to commodify at a
   rapid pace. Linux is simply taking the lead in that much broader
   movement. The new commodity operating system isn't Linux but whatever
   UNIX you feel like using, Linux included. If you're working under the
   hood in command-line mode, the differences between Linux, BSD, Solaris
   and OS X matter less than the fact that deep down they're all breeds
   of an OS that's purely infrastructural.

   I suspect that Palladium isn't as infrastructural as Microsoft would
   like it to look. But it still involves a number of concessions that
   make clear that the company is simply a significant inhabitant of a
   larger ecosystem, rather than the whole environment.

  Views on Linux in Business

  --by Doc Searls, Senior Editor of Linux Journal

                              "Getting Clear"

   Thursday, July 11--The appeals of Linux the enterprise are rapidly
   crossing the perceptual line between the possible and the obvious. On
   Monday, eWeek published "Open-Source Enterprise":
   http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,362400,00.asp, in which Debra
   Donston wrote, "It's not a question of whether open source should
   exist in the enterprise, but a question of how much and where."
   According to eWeek Labs West Coast Technical Director Timothy Dyck,
   "there's probably no company that hasn't used open source." There's a
   trend here, and it's apparent in eWeek's name, which used to be PC
   Week.

   But what is that trend toward, and is it only about open source? Let
   me put it a different way: Is open source (or free software, or any of
   the other well-worn Linux development topics) the only subject we can
   talk about here? Now that open source and Linux are so successful, are
   there any new topics we should start paying attention to?

   I had that question in mind earlier this week when I interviewed Tim
   O'Reilly:
   http://tim.oreilly.com for two hours. It was a follow-up to an
   interview from January 2000:
   http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=4467, conducted at
   LinuxWorld Expo during the height of the dot-com boom. What interested
   me about Tim at the time was his experienced perspective. Tim had been
   around both publishing and UNIX for so long that he knew how trends
   tend to work, how to take advantage of them and how not to get sucked
   in by transient obsessions.

   During this week's interview (which is still being transcribed), Tim
   said, "Successful businesses and movements know that trends tend to
   peak and start on a downturn. Often there is a related trend, an
   expansion, or a different slant on it, that is picking up steam at the
   same time. And you have to jump to the new curve."

   When you're talking about subjects like Linux and open source--a
   technology and a methodology that are each soaking into the world,
   spreading like a stain--the trend is not part of a sine wave. If there
   is a decline, it's more likely to be one of velocity, not of
   direction. But even a velocity change is still a curve. And maybe the
   subject at hand isn't the only one that people want to talk about.
   Topics rarely travel alone; there must be allied trends nearby.

   So, what are the allied trends that tend to support Linux and open
   source but are not immediately concerned with them--that are starting
   to ramp up?

   I've been thinking lately about two candidates. One is infrastructure,
   and the other is transparency. I've been writing about both here in
   SuitWatch and on the Linux Journal site. "Is Linux Infrastructure--or
   Is It Deeper than That?":
   http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6074 ran on the site in
   May. "Is Transparency the Killer Virtue?":
   http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6196 ran a few days ago.

   In both cases I looked at conversations taking place outside the
   traditional Linux community, or outside the usual conversations within
   the Linux community. For example, IBM may now belong to the Linux
   community, but its INFRASTRUCTURE campaign:
   http://www-3.ibm.com/e-business/doc/content/event/infrastructure.html
   doesn't even mention Linux on its web page. I believe that's because
   IBM is less interested in selling Linux as an operating system than in
   putting it to use as infrastructure supporting IBM products and
   services. In that role, Linux is somewhat invisible.

   Which brings me to a question I've been wrestling with: Is
   infrastructure naturally transparent? If so, that would seem to
   account for much of its appeal.

   A few years ago I was talking to a friend who was a programmer for a
   rapidly growing dot-com. Their platform was Windows NT, which he said
   was fraught with memory leaks and other reliability problems. He added
   this: "When I'm building a skyscraper, I want to know there's rebar in
   the concrete. With Linux, I know. With Microsoft, I don't. In fact,
   NT's memory leaks prove to me there isn't rebar in there. Since I have
   to work with NT for political reasons, I just cope with it. But I know
   if we could see the source, we could probably fix the problem pretty
   fast."

   I've thought often about what he said, almost always in terms of
   "open" and "closed". But what about "transparent" and "opaque"? Yes,
   concrete building materials are hardly transparent in a literal sense,
   but builders need to be extremely clear about what they're working
   with. If it's foundational stuff--true infrastructure, not a
   "platform" that sits on other infrastructure--the builder wants to
   know, or to be in a position to find out, exactly what's in there.
   Lives, or at least livelihoods, depend on it.

   There is another reason transparency appeals as a virtue. It's not a
   loaded term that brings up all kinds of old political conflicts from
   inside the community, as "open:" and "free" tend to do. It also
   doesn't need much explaining. The reason governments from Peru to
   China are adopting Linux has everything to do with the transparency of
   its innards. It also may have to do with its price and its development
   methods, but transparency is the deeper issue. Without any secrets,
   governments don't have to waste any time or energy wondering what's in
   there.

   Positioning Linux as transparent infrastructure--along with the Net it
   augments--also tends to position Windows as non-infrastructural (or
   relatively less infrastructural) software, regardless of its immense
   popularity. If there are limits to which one can conceptually depend
   on it, then there are limits to its qualifications as infrastructure.
   This doesn't make it bad, but less useful as foundational building
   material.

   Note that I'm not saying opaque platforms and software that run on
   those platforms are bad either; I'm simply saying they are not
   necessarily infrastructural. If their developers are smart, they'll
   make use of existing infrastructural protocols or write some of their
   own. That's what Userland and Microsoft did by developing SOAP, a
   purely infrastructural protocol that benefits every product that uses
   it.

   Yesterday I put up a new discussion at the Linux for Suits forum,
   titled "Should we be talking more about transparency?":
   http://www.linuxjournal.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Forum&file=vie
   wtopic&topic=180&forum=18

   I'm honestly not sure. What do you think? Jump in the forum, and let's
   talk about it.

rc stands for resource configuration.  It generally means that it's a
config file for whatever is before the rc.  For example, .bashrc is a
config file for your bash environment.

dia isn't bad.  It stores the diagram in an XML form, and there are a
couple of compilers out there that can take a dia UML diagram and
generate code stubs and data structures from it.  One takes UML and
outputs SQL.

If you are interested in automatic layout too, you might want to check
out graphviz from at&t research.  Google should find it.

I have a paper to write constrasting MacOSX and Windows 2000.  I also
wanted to contrast Mac OS with Linux, and on GUI issues Gnome (Redhat
7.x specifically if a distro is needed, as that is where most of my
Linux experience is.

Would welcome any input from those experienced in Linux and MacOSX - My
experience with all Win32 is considerable (except Me which I considered
a waste of resources - both electronic and financial).  My experience
with all flavors of Max OS is nil.  Oh, yes, feel free to throw in your
$.02 comparing MacOSX and Win2k as well :)

I understand MacOSX runs on on what is essentially a proprietary
BSD-like OS?

Thanks,
Greg

I don't know about everyone else, but I find that combination of black
lettering on a dark blue background for the header to be difficult to
read.  I have occasionally encountered sites that use it heavily, and
usually develop a headache very quickly when I try to use them.  Of
course, maybe I am just unusually sensitive to that color combination.

Okay, this might turn out to be a stupid question, but on your
dia "File" menu - is there a way to save files?  I have New, Open,
Preferences, PlugIns, exit.  One I make a new drawing I can't figure
out any way to save it. Maybe I need to download a more "complete"
version, but I just thought I'd ask.  (Mine also has nothing in the

I have considerable experience with OSX (I signed up at the Public Beta
phase) and I have spent some time in *nix as well, so if you would let me
know what sort of issues you are interested in I'll do my best to fill you
in. (See below)

OSX comes in two pieces, essentially. There's the guts, called Darwin, which
is the *nix stuff. Underpinnings (I think) is the word Apple uses. Darwin is
based on BSD, but is propietary (which is how they get away with charging
for it). Aqua is the second piece of the OS. Aqua is the UI portion of
things. This is the part you see, but is not necessarily what you are stuck
with. I have heard tell of others using different window managers aside from
Aqua, and I know that you can boot OSX into single user mode, enable root,
run fsck, and all sorts of other groovy *nixy stuff with Terminal.

One of the things I think is most impressive about OSX (It's pronounced oh
ess ten, btw) is what they call "Classic". This is the ability of OSX to run
an emulation layer of OS9, the 'old' OS. It's not as big a deal now that the
Big Ones have OSX versions (Photoshop, Office, etc) but if you still need
something from OS9 there's nothing standing in the way of your forward
migration. To build a native emulator of an entire OS into the system itself
is pretty gol-danged cool.

My experience with OSX vs. Win2k is as follows:

I have both in my office right now. I use OSX and my husband uses the
Wintendo (as I lovingly refer to it). He restarts his all the time. Things
happen, stuff just up and breaks, etc. He knows to do preventative
maintenance on his machine because I won't help him with it if he doesn't.
(: I restart mine when I have a software update that requires it. And even
then I store up a bunch of them. This is nowhere near as often. I mean, not
even once a month. I don't run Outlook or IIS so I don't get the virus du
jour. I don't have any problems with file compatibility or with trying to do
things on my Mac that he can do on his machine, and I don't have to go
through any sort of gyration most of the time. In fact, I run as the
fileserver on our network because it's easier to set up and less work to
admin my machine than it is to set him up the same way. I have only ever
worried about my computer freaking out when my hard drive began to swallow
itself whole. Usually I want to hug my computer. My husband usually wants to
hit his.

Wow I got long-winded! This help? (:

Try right clicking on the window that contains the file you want to save.
The interface makes sense after you use it a little bit.

Good luck,

Most of the books mentioned so far revolve around system administration;
if you want a theoretical approach try Bell Lab's classic "Operating
Systems" (the dinosaur book) by Avi Silberschatz; it has a hefty chapter
on the internals of Linux, as well as covering general operating system
concepts.

For those interested in Mach, FreeBSD, or Nachos, there are
supplementary chapters on those systems freely available at:

http://www.bell-labs.com/topic/books/os-book/

Btw, much of the Hurd microkernel is derived from Mach.

The term "operating system" covers a lot of ground -- at what level are
you performing this comparison? Operating systems could be compared at:

1) kernel level (how the OS actually works)

2) API level (what developers interact with)

3) Application level (what users interact with)

You might find FreeBSD and GNU/Linux-based systems very similar at levels
2 and 3, for example, but very different at level 1. Strictly speaking,
Windows NT is also similar at level 2 since it can implement POSIX.

Also note how inner workings of the operating system are largely
transparent: an expert Linux or Windows programmer might not have much
idea what kind of paging table the OS uses, or how VMM is implemented.

[This message may sound like trolling. This is

What do you mean by books that describe 'why'? I don't
exactly get what you mean. It seems to me that if you
want to do something, you would have a reason why. The
question usually is "I want to do this, HOW to I do
it?" not "I can do this, WHY would I want to do so?".
Or, do you mean why it is the way it it? For example,
why do I have to type "tar xvzf
somepackage.1.0.0.tar.gz"? Please explain.

Agreed, the lighter purple (dare I say 'lavender'?) is less swimmy. Like the 
background--something I'd use for an xterm.  Think I like the top

Spoken by an advocates of a "FREE" operating system.  I now have 2 Linux
and only one Windows box at home.  So if there is a problem with windows, why
does it seem to take twice as long to fix?

Some measures of impact should include:
Time it takes to get fix available. (Time patch made available minus time of 
discovery.)
Time it takes to apply the patch.
Labor cost involved in aplying patch.
Cost of lost work.
Cost of lost data.

Sort of a CS misery index.

Hey that's cool.

>
> Btw, much of the Hurd microkernel is derived from Mach.

I think the more correct thing to say would be that the microkernel used
by Hurd is the Mach microkernel (it only has slight modifications, to call
it the GNU Mach).  Hurd is a collection of "servers" that run in user
space and provide much functionality that is traditionaly built right into
the kernel.  This approach has a performance penalty, but allows for
debugging of many kernel modules in user space.  Another advantage is that
servers can be loaded/unloaded dynamically.  In many cases this allows
kernel development to be done by non-root users, with the advantage of
allowing the developer to use a normal debugger.  And one more advantage
of seperating the address space of the servers and kernel, is that it is
much harder to corruput the internal state of the kernel.  The servers
actually have a normal main like normal C programs.

One interesting feature of the Hurd is that you don't mount things in the
traditional sense.  Instead you create a translation, or a server that
provides a translation.  One simple but interesting example is a file that
changes its contents whenever it is read.  One use might be a .sig file
that changes to a new sig everytime it is read.

One final note is that Hurd is planning to change to the L4 microkernel as
soon as the L4 developers give the signal.  I don't know much about L4
other than it is getting a lot of attention from its performance and
stability.

Anyway...that is all I know about the subject...

Not necessarily. "Why?" is a very good question, and an important one.

 From the original query, I take it to mean that the subject in question 
wishes to understand why they are doing the configuring they're doing. They 
aren't content with simply following someones' instructions because they're 
told to.

Why do we use a firewall?

Why do we configure postfix the way we do?

Why do we... etc.

If we stop asking why, then we're just repeating what others before us have 
done, and we'll all be in trouble when a flaw is found. One of the reasons 
we have freedom of the press in this country is so that someone will 
continue to ask, "Why?"

In my mind, the why question is every bit as important as the how question. 
In fact, the why question should be answered satisfactorily, prior to one 
asking the how question.

Why should I ask how to do something, if doing so, makes no sense?

Just because one can do a thing, does not mean that one *should* do that 
thing. If there is a compelling reason to do it, then that may be the 
answer to the question of, "why?"

I, and I assume the person in question here too, want to know why I must do 
these things, not simply that I must do them. Then let me decide for myself 
if I really *must* do them.

Russ,

"Why" do you want to know how to tell when you're out of invisible ink?
For that matter, "why" would you buy invisible ink in the first place.
Seems like a waste of money to me.  I could possibly justify disappearing
ink, but not invisible ink.

BTW, this message was written in disappearing electrons and will vanish in

Not necessarily. "Why?" is a very good question, and an important one.

 From the original query, I take it to mean that the subject in question
wishes to understand why they are doing the configuring they're doing. They
aren't content with simply following someones' instructions because they're
told to.

Why do we use a firewall?

Why do we configure postfix the way we do?

Why do we... etc.

If we stop asking why, then we're just repeating what others before us have
done, and we'll all be in trouble when a flaw is found. One of the reasons
we have freedom of the press in this country is so that someone will
continue to ask, "Why?"

In my mind, the why question is every bit as important as the how question.
In fact, the why question should be answered satisfactorily, prior to one
asking the how question.

Why should I ask how to do something, if doing so, makes no sense?

Just because one can do a thing, does not mean that one *should* do that
thing. If there is a compelling reason to do it, then that may be the
answer to the question of, "why?"

I, and I assume the person in question here too, want to know why I must do
these things, not simply that I must do them. Then let me decide for myself
if I really *must* do them.

While I'm as confused about this question as just about anyone who has
already responded in this thread, I'll throw in a few cents.

Personally, I think that if you're new to Unix and unix-like operating
systems, the first thing you should read is Essential System
Administration by Aeleen Frisch.  The website
(<URL: http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/esa3/ >) says that the third edition
is 2002 (est.).  I don't know if it's available yet.  But this is probably
the best guide to understanding why we do things "the Unix way" that I've
ever seen.

I imagine that since GNU/Linux has exploded in popularity since the
previous edition was published, we can expect a fair amount of focus on
those systems (and distributions other than Ygdrassil).

Failure to read this book is the number one reason we see people on this
list who have entries in their fstab like this:

/dev/hdc1	/D	ext2	defaults	0	1

I can't tell you how much that sort of thing annoys me.

I'll definitely keep the place in mind.  If the service is as you

Network abstraction is, to me, probably the number two selling point of

Being proprietary isn't "how they get away with charging for it".

Being proprietary is how they get away with restricting its distribution
and hiding its implementation details from those to whom they choose to
distribute.

It's an important distinction.

Note that Free Software is not proprietary, but you can charge whatever
you like for it.  You just can't hide its implementation details by
distributing only binaries or restrict its further distribution by other
people.

The BSD license specifically allows such distribution restrictions and
carries no requirement of openness or freedom.  It is essentially a
license to take from the public domain without adding anything.

	There is a very important distinction... but that's not it.  At
least not for Darwin.  As far as I can tell, there isn't much argument to
be made that Apple is restricting the distribution of Darwin.  It is only
propietary in the sense that Apple modified a number of things in BSD to
work on their hardware and with some of their other technologies.  To
learn more about it (or download it so you can install it yourself -
without cost) go to:
	http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/darwin/
They have source code available, a binary installer for the current
version, a CVS repository, etc.  (Note: I believe you do need to register
as a "developer" in order to get to most of the downloads.)

	What they are charging for, and "ptotecting" in some sense, is
Aqua - all the graphical stuff on top of that.  If you install Darwin, you
get UNIX, sure... but nothing on top of it.  You can then build XFree86 on
top of it, if you want a graphical interface, but you won't get one from
Apple.  That's what they want you to buy OS X for.  (And really, what's
the point of Darwin by itself for most users?  LinuxPPC or one of the
other PPC Linux distros has far more to offer).

I think being proprietary is freedom for covering up defects.  Notice I
don't use the word bugs.  Calling defects bugs has the effect of
shifting responsibility for defects to a mythical creepy crawly that
infests bit rot into code.  Programmers create defects, not bugs.

	I've been using Linux for about 5-6 years (mostly on Apple
hardware, actually) but my desktop systems at home have been classic Mac
OS and OS X since March a year ago.
	First impressions: GUI is very different from anything else I'd
used.  "Cleaner" than X (which has always felt a little klunky to me) and
a little more intuative than Windows.  There seemed to be a lot "missing"
that I wanted, but I was able to adjust very quickly and I can get around
very efficently now.  Even my wife (a Windows sysadmin) doesn't get mad at
it, like she did MacOS 9.
	Stability: similar to Linux.  My OS X machine has crashed probably
5 times in the last year.  Once because I was doing something naughtly
(running a program that I knew was a resource hog on old/slow hardware -
maybe it didn't crash, but I was sick of waiting), the other times it hung
on shutdown (no good idea why).  My Win2K box at work is fairly stable as
well (probably the same number of crashes in the past year), but it seems
to be "worse" when it does crash (like blowing out its video drivers for
no apparent reason).

	As a Mac / Linux user, the system over all was a major blessing.
I had been programming with perl (and now PHP) on top of apache and
postgres all installed on a Linux backend while using the Mac as a front
end - since that's where I had all the tools I liked and the OS I prefered
to interface with directly.  Now I have a single machine that I can do the
same things on without the division of labor.  I currently have all those
server-type things installed as well as XFree86 (XDarwin) so I can run
things like ethereal or rdesktop when I need to.
	With fink (on sourceforge), many unix packages have been ported
over to the OS X / Darwin platform.  I'm not a good enough programmer to
know exactly how difficult it is, but my understanding is that there
really isn't much to do for most things.  Quite often I can download
source code from the internet and compile directly.  (Note: basic install
will not allow this, but you can get Apple's Developer Tools for free
(again, with registration) and get all the necessary command line tools
and a rather nice IDE, if you want to get into Mac OS X programming.)

	From others I've talked to:  If you know BSD, open the Terminal
and you'll be right at home in the shell, if not the directory structure.
If you've used NeXT, a *lot* will look familiar (directory structure and
some elements of the GUI - like the column views).  If you're used to Mac
OS Classic, you might have a lot of adjusting to do.  Same with Windows
users.  For Linux people, it will look and feel a lot different, but
you'll be able to do a lot of the same things.

	Hopefully, this didn't wander too much (or sound too much like a
commercial for Apple's Switch campaign <grin>).  I'm just not really busy
at work right now...

I find that my husband will sometimes ooh and ask me what that is. He didn't
do that in os9. He also really enjoys iTunes and is learning to do basic
stuff on my machine so he can use my speakers instead of his. (I understand
why though...these are my speakers:

I totally missed this! That was one of my favorite things. "Oh, your dad
wants to send you the pictures from his digital camera? Let me install my
FTP server. (Open System Preferences, check a box) Ok, here's his login and
password." "You want to set up an intranet so you can view the photos on my
machine? Let me install Apache real quick. (Again, check a box) OK, here's
the address..."

I love that.

As with any *nix, if you do dumb things you might as well hang a "h4x04 M3!"
sign off your IP for script kiddies with free time (I mean, it is summer
vacation), but if you have a lick of sense, you can keep it pretty secure
and still operate beautifully.

I'm going to send this now, all this mac stuff has reminded me it's time for

I've never used Kai's or Intel's C++ compilers.  I find g++ works fine for C++
especially the 3.x versions of g++.  There was an article in Dr. Dobb's a couple
of months back where they ran language compliance tests with various C++
compilers - the only two I recall were gcc and Micro$oft's compiler, but there
were others in the mix.  The results of their tests showed that g++ was near the
top in the language compliance department (in fact, if I recall correctly, of
the compilers tested g++ was the most compliant), while Micro$oft's compiler was
the worst.

Anyway, the opionions you got about g++ may have been from folks who were using
pre-3.x versions.

Sorry Russ.  It's my fault for not being a good communicator.  I meant
that your email was not flaming or flame bait.  It did contain strong

But I read my reply again today and I see that it didn't sound like what I

BSD code also comes as Free Software, even by the FSF's definition:

    Non-copylefted free software
    
    Non-copylefted free software comes from the author with permission
    to redistribute and modify, and also to add additional
    restrictions to it.

    If a program is free but not copylefted, then some copies or
    modified versions may not be free at all. A software company can
    compile the program, with or without modifications, and distribute
    the executable file as a proprietary software product.

See: <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html>

Now, as soon as you (or someone else) start distributing only binaries
and/or restrict its further distribution, then that is no longer Free
Software.  One of the nice features of BSD code these days from a GNU
perspective, is that its relicensability can be used to GNU-ify
previously non-copylefted Free Software, to make it "more Free" in the
GNU sense.

Or the 3.x versions....

They may better optimize the code, but they haven't been welcomed with
open arms completely yet.

Last I read, the Kernel development team still wanted us to compile with
2.95.  I could be mistaken, there, though.  :-)

I use emacs 20.7.

In .emacsrc I have:

(setq auto-mode-alist
      (cons '("\\.php$" . php-mode) auto-mode-alist))

(autoload 'php-mode "php-mode" "PHP editing mode." t)


I also have the files:

There is no C++ in the kernel.  I think the issue is that gcc 3.x is stricter
about some things than gcc 2.9x was so the kernel won't compile yet with 3.x. 
They probably still need to do some code cleanup before they can compile the
kernel with 3.x... this will actually be a good thing.

You can have as many versions of gcc installed as you like, that takes care 
of kernel compilation. 

Anyone have any notions on the original question, which may not have been 
clear: for developing applications in C++,  what compiler do you prefer? The 
developers I've talked to so far like Kai and Intel for these reasons:

-complete support for IA 32 & 64 instructions sets
-more support for various C++ libraries and widgets
-faster compilation and runtimes

That's the story I'm getting so far.

thanks,
Carla

Doesn't gcc have this now?

I tend to doubt it - think of all the libraries and widgets that come with your
average Linux distro, they used gcc to compile these.

> -faster compilation and runtimes
split this into two because they're often mutually exclusive.
For your day to day development you want fast compilation so you don't turn on
any optimization, but when you do a release you want to bump your optimization
up to the max which means it'll take longer to compile.  I can believe that the
Intel compiler probably has better optimization for Intel architectures, not
sure about compilation speed, though.

How about price? 
What about language coverage? (I think gcc wins here, but I'd have to dig up the
article)

The last time I bothered caring and looked into Intel's C++ compiler
versus G++ I came out with these conclusions:

Intel's supports more of the P2/3/4 specialized instructions than GCC,
but GCC supports the AMD instructions which the Intel compiler doesn't
at all.

Intel's both compiles faster and tends to produce faster run-times than
3.x (and 3.x compiles slower but tends to produce faster run-times than
2.x).

But in terms of features, there isn't another compiler that comes
anywhere close to G++ in standards support.

g++ 3 supports C++ templates and namespaces in ways that 2.x doesn't.  
Also, there are some STL interfaces (e.g., sstream) that aren't
supported in 2.x. You'll encounter the problems with 2.x when you try 
to compile code that really relies on the newer C++ standard stuff; 
the Sablotron XSLT processor is like that.

GCC still lacks support for some of the fancy features of the IA-64
architecture such as speculation and software pipelining using
rotating registers.  This hurts IA-64 applications which are heavy
with floating point.  Sorry I don't have any hard data; this is just
from staring at a lot of generated code.

As for C++, library interfaces were changing up to about 3.0.2, which
sometimes caused problems using old shared libraries with new binaries
and vice versa.  If you compile everything with 3.0.2 or later, you
should be ok.

And think in terms of freedoms.  Remember that when you use gcc you are
using/supporting free software.  If you're big on principles then the "my
compiler is faster than your compiler" argument is not really important.
Unless you want to hack the source and make it faster :)

The other thing to remember about compiliing is that if you use makefiles
properly then the time to compile is drastically reduced when developing.
As for releases, I can wait an extra hour if need be.  I believe that gcc
also has many misunderstood options for creating optimizied programs.  I
would be interested in seeing what benchmarks were used, and what
optimazations where applied.  It may be the case that with the right set
of optimizations for the benchmark/architecture that gcc is just as
fast...

Well that's my highly opinionated $0.02 :)

For C++ there's big difference between gcc 2.x and 3.x. Version 3.x
is much closer to standard C++. For that reason it is the compiler of
choice for my present project. This project's source code base will be around
for a very long time so it will pay to be as forward-compatible as possible.
Sticking to ANSI C++ provides the best chance for forward-compatibility.
On the down side, there some risk in using 3.x because it's still fairly
young, and it's slower to compile code. Supposedly there were some
performance improvements in 3.1 (mostly in the preprocessor) but I've
not tried it yet. It looks like Mandrake will be the first distro to use 3.x
to compile all their code. That should air it out.

I'll second that endorsement. I have the second edition, circa 1995. The
advantage I see to some of the older seminal *nix books is that they _do_
often address the "why" question, if only by showing that something is
done a certain way because it's been done that way since the dawn of time.
Its useful even if you never plan to deal with a SCO/AIX/etc box, if just
from a historical perspective.

Not that there hasn't been a tremendous amount of progress, but the basic
concepts have been around for many moons. That is something that has taken
some acclimation for me, in picking up the *nix culture. Our original
poster seems to be talking about learning the culture and "way of doing
things" as much as anything. How about the History of UNIX? Many google
hits on this one; everthing from

http://www.bell-labs.com/history/unix/

Compilation speed is better in 3.1 (compared with 3.0.x), and inlining
is done in a different way.  The RTL inliner in 3.0.x had a reputation
for being overly aggressive, sometimes even reducing performance because
of code bloat.  The inliner in 3.1 is tree-based and uses less aggressive
heuristics.  In fact, one of the problems we had in compiling an IA-64
Linux kernel with GCC 3.1 was that the kernel code assumed certain
functions would be inlined, and they weren't with 3.1.  Fortunately,
GCC provides many command line options to control such things, so a
simple makefile tweak fixed it.

Well off the top of my head I'd say there is no file named new_fax in the 
/etc/mgetty+sendfax/ directory. :-)  If memory servers me correct (it's 
been two+ years) the file new_fax is executed when a new FAX arrives.  It 
can do many things from simply filing the fax, to sending tit ot a 
printer, or even cause a pop-up (Windows Messager) to alert people a new 
fax has arrived.

I've been trying to figure out how to minimize a Redhat Linux

I also build/support several name servers and would like to make sure they 
are at the minimum software level to work.

I see this possible but I'm not really sure how to determine the RPM 
dependencies except by brute force.  I.e. do a test erase (-e --test) for 
each package.  Anyone aware of a tool for graphically showing the 
dependencies?

Any thoughts on this?

If you really want to start the daemons outside of the service script 
mentioned above, it would be something like:

/usr/sbin/smbd -D | /usr/sbin/nmbd -D

If you want to find a certain executable, try:

whereis <executable name>

I prefer:

rpm -q --whatrequires <packagename>

as it gives _just_ a list of dependencies, rather than the mess that the erase 
n' test method gives, i.e.

[youngdan at dan youngdan]$ rpm -q --whatrequires mozilla
mozilla-chat-1.0.0-4
mozilla-devel-1.0.0-4
mozilla-dom-inspector-1.0.0-4
mozilla-js-debugger-1.0.0-4
mozilla-mail-1.0.0-4
mozilla-psm-1.0.0-4
galeon-1.2.5-1

It's not GUI, but it's certainly easier to parse.

/usr/sbin/redir --laddr=99.999.99.999 --lport=1417 --caddr=192.168.0.111 --c

port=1419 &

May not be the best way but I run these out of rc.local.  Any startup script
should work.
Here is how it works.

laddr is listen address
lport is listen port
caddr is connect address
cport is connect port
& runs the program in the background

Should work!

You can also use iptables for port redirection.

I realize you said RH, but here's my take on the Debian side of things.

1) it's much easier to keep your packages updated with cron-apt or a 
cron job that runs apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade

2) removing packages (and finding dependency problems/issues) is as easy 
as apt-get remove [package].  If a package you want to remove has too 
many dependencies, it tells you just exactly what they are.  If it 
doesn't, bye-bye [package]

3) although it's not that important to ME, personally, Debian is a 
GNU/Linux Distribution - meaning it's free as in beer AND as in speech.

The above reasons are pretty much why I went from using RH exclusively 
to now using Debian exclusively.  Dependencies are a major pain in the 
arse, and although no package manager is *perfect*, apt and dpkg come 
pretty close.

You might see how mature the apt-rpm (or somesuch) packages are 
nowadays.  I tried it on my RH system before I converted to Debian, but 
the functionality just wasn't there.

YMMV.

-Richard

xinetd also works for this.  You can set up a unlisted service that
listens on a specific port, and then you put in a "redirect" option that
will forward all data to that port onto somewhere else.  I use this to ssh
to a machine behind my firewall.

I've never actually tried what I'm about to suggest, but this is what 
I'd try first:

During the installation process, choose to do a custom installation. 
Deselect all of the package groups except 'Base' and any others you 
absolutely know are essential to your host's operation, e.g.,

* Network Support
* DNS Name Server

The RedHat/base/comps found with your installation media lists the 
packages included in each of the package groups.

Yes, Debian!  When code matters more than commercials.  Qualitatively
and Quantitatively, Debian is hands down the best choice logicale libre
distribution for the IT implementor.  It is simply the best and most
extensive toolkit available.  Debian is a treasure trove.

I recommend using "aptitude" for many tasks, rather than "apt-get". 
Most of the features that "aptitude" offers via it's tui (text user
interface; ncurses based) are also available via the command line.  It
utilizes the same library, libapt-pkg (C++), that "apt-get" does, but
provides additional functionality over and above that of "apt-get"...

Here's one of the things that "aptitude" makes into a simple task. 
Inside it's TUI.  You can easily see the forward and reverse "Depends",
"Recommends", "Suggests", and "Enhances" dependencies.

"aptitude" will let you mark a package as having been installed due to
another package listing it as a dependency.  It can be set so that it
will automatically uninstall packages so marked when their reverse
depends packages are uninstalled.  This feature is the solution to the
problem presented in the original question.

You can also put a package on "hold" status, and it and it's
dependencies will never be automatically upgraded from that point on. 
You must unhold it to get it to upgrade after that.  This feature is
very useful when you've patched something locally, or need to maintain a
version of something for which a (non security or feature critical)
upgrade would break a set of local admin scripts (for instance), or that
you've patched, like if you've got ipfilter patches applied to your
kernel and have rebuilt iptables to match.   Aptitude's command line can
be used to script the setting and unsetting of hold status when need be,
in case you've got to write a script to run on many machines or
something.

If you need to rebuild a Debian package, perhaps to configure it with a
feature not built into it by default, or to apply a patch you need in
it, you can easily do so with "apt-get source" and a minor amount of
effort (I recommend the use of CVS to facilitate maintenance.).  It will
easily build a binary .deb with your changes, with a simple
"debian/rules binary".  The Debian packaging system is well documented
(look around on http://www.pdxlinux.org/dc/) and driven by standard
"make", rather than by a special tool that introduces yet another syntax
you must learn.  The build system is infinitely  malleable, modular, and
easy to extend in arbitrary ways.  (Can YOU predict future needs?) 

You can then place that .deb into a locally visible HTTP server, run a
command that builds the apt "Packages" meta data file, and add that site
to the "sources.list" on all the machines where you want that
installed.  You then create a "Release" file (see the official Debian
archive with a web browser to see where to put it and what it contains;
also read the apt_preferences man page), and set up apt "preferences" to
cause your local builds to shadow the upstream archive or your local
mirror of the unmodified upstream packages.

Another cool feature of "dpkg" is "dpkg --get-selections >
dpkg-selections", "scp dpkg-selections otherbox", "ssh otherbox", "dpkg
--set-selections < dpkg-selections", "apt-get dselect-upgrade".  That
will duplicate the package set from one box to another.

Yes -- It's a shared resource pool for IT professionals.  It's our
toolkit, as per the GNU Manifesto.

It keeps getting better and better, doesn't it?  (got any good hat
recipes?)  I've not reinstalled "bittersweet" for FOUR or FIVE years
now.  She's been upgraded, in place, often without even a reboot, many
many times over the years.  I love the way that core packages, such as
Sendmail, are set up to minimize the service downtime.  When I upgrade
from one release of Sendmail to the next, the downtime averages in the
sub-minute range.  It has always been flawless, but I know that the
downgrade path is available when I need it provided I "dpkg-repack" or
keep a copy of the last version on hand. (a wise precaution in a
production environment).

Even if "apt-rpm" works, theres no way in hell that Red Hat is going to
be able to package as much software as you'll find in the Debian
distribution.  There are more libraries available for developers, more
games for the kids, more tools for the student and scientist in Debian
than in any other distribution.  And it supports the largest number of
hardware architectures relative to any other distribution.

The other thing is that "dpkg" has a richer feature set wrt package
dependency declaration and maintainer script functionality than RPM
does, or so I gather.

Perhaps you should install "SWAT" and allow it to configure Samba for
you?

Does the RPM you installed offer the choice of running Samba from either
inetd or standalone?  (I bet they have nothing comparable to "debconf"
at this point.)

Subject: [PLUG] debootstrap -- try Debian on your RPM based machines (are belong to
 us)
Message-ID: <1027530694.6196.64.camel@bittersweet>

There's an "rpm" of "debootstrap" in
http://people.pdxlinux.org/~karlheg/ if anyone would like to try it.  It
was converted from the Debian package to an rpm with "alien --to-rpm".

You can use "mc" (Midnight Commander) to browse inside of the RPM, or
use the rpm command that just unpacks it in your current directory, to
reassure yourself that it's not a trojan horse; that it's honestly just
what it says it is and no more.

"debootstrap" will install a Debian base system in a subdirectory.  It
will not affect anything outside of that subdirectory.  Once you've run
it, you can "cd DIR && chroot . && cd /" and work with Debian while
inside there.  You'll have access to "apt-get" and everything.

If you know how to create an empty loopback filesystem, you can mount it
and run the "debootstrap" in there, umount it, then use that loopback
filesystem to boot a User Mode Linux.  It works very well.

"debootstrap" requires only "bash", "wget" and "binutils".

I like "mmm-mode", which you can find if you look around a little on the
"http://www.masonhq.com/" site.  It gives you multiple major modes in
the same buffer.  You edit your template in psgml-mode as HTML, and the
PHP or Perl parts are in their own mode.

At http://people.pdxlinux.org/~karlheg/mmm=ext.el you'll find a simple
extension that makes mmm-mode work for php and embedded css stylesheets.

RTFM to learn how to make this work.

Hey, that's my idea. For years now, in my networking classes,
I've used the example of LMTP - the Lightweight Matter
Transportation Protocol. It's helpful when trying to illustrate
why protocols need to have error-detection, error-correction,
delivery of packets in order, and most important, a reliable
plaform.

You might want to look into User-Mode Linux, that will allow you to setup
virtual Linux machines running on a Linux host for testing and other
purposes.  The latest version of Debian includes it in the distribution,
RedHat and others might also.

Of course if you are willing to pay money there is also VMWare.

I use vservers already but I'm trying to do the main server so I need a 
system I can really screw-up and just install/remove again.

> Of course if you are willing to pay money there is also VMWare.

I have an older copy and had forgotten about it.  Be interesting to 
install RH, the vserver package, and create some vservers in it.  Let's
see:  Linux running VMware, running RH w/ vserver package, running
multiple vservers.  That would get the CPU cranking.  :-)

  Well, Ed, now you can tell your students that you're following a real RFC.

I'm looking for a way of replacing a MS Exchange server.

The people involved use Outlook with shared address books and joint

I think I can replace the shared address books with an LDAP server.

How do I replace the joint scheduling?

Would Bynari's InsightConnector do this?  Is there a better solution?

This is not the same as User-Mode Linux, UML creates a complete virtual
machine with virtual hard-drive, network, console, etc., and you can
even install different brands of Linux within the virtual machine,
regardless of what your host is running.  UML uses a patched version of
the stock linux kernel which runs as a program in user space, but when it
boots up, you are running an entirely separate instance of Linux using a
large file as a virtual hard drive.  There is also a special file system
that supports direct access to a directory tree on you local drive, but I
haven't tried it yet (I prefer complete separation between virtual
machines and host).  If you were at the PLUG meeting for my presentation
on virtual computing environments a few months ago, UML is the virtual
machine that I used to boot and run DOOM inside of an Xnest virtual
server.

I have a friend who clings to MS because she needs AOL.  The reason she

the country.  At home she uses DSL but on the road she can dial an 800

Are there any OSS soloutions to this this issue?  Netzero does not

David,

  I _thought_ that Evolution did this job. There's another solution that was
mentioned in A) Linux Journal, B) IDG Weekly Newsletter, C) Linux Journal
Weekly Newsletter or D) None of the above. Seriously, I did read something
recently but didn't pay a lot of attention because I need to schedule only
for me and the Palm Pilot and jpilot are all I need.

SISNA has, the last time I checked, 3400 dialup locations around the
world.  Unless she's getting stuck in No-where, North Dakota  (sorry but 
it was the most remoteish place I could think of quickly) it should be 
a local call.  No 800 required.  They might offer 800 numbers also.
   I can't say SISNA 'supports' Linux but since it's just a ppp connection
it hasn't been a problem.  I connect using them all the time from my Linux
boxen.  Of course I'm slightly biased as I know everyone at the local
office - ASISNA.COM

  I've read a rather neat solution to this ... at least, it seems like a
solution. The person writing described having a no cost, web-based e-mail
account. When he traveled, he'd forward his mail to that account and he'd
then be able to access it while gone. Upon return he'd turn off the
forwarding.

  A lot of hotels have free web access for business travelers.

We have several customers who still run Exchange.  We have been trying to

Exchange.  Bynari's software is the closest we have found.  Of course, it

One potential problem with this is that alot of these no cost email
accounts have severe mailbox size limitations, so if you don't check
your email very often, get alot of email, or receive some large
spams/viruses (a number of these I have received lately run up to 300k),
everything sent to you will start bouncing.  Probably be a good idea to
use a store and forward approach rather than just forwarding, so anything
you miss will still be in your mailbox when you get home.

Phew.  Shocked there weren't flames following this.  There are almost
always a few mules who bray every time someone responds with a Debian
solution.  Even (especially?) when it's exactly the right thing to
suggest.

Those reasons are all quite good, though the third one doesn't really
relate to the reason he gave for using Red Hat.

When I hear or read someone use the phrase "RPM makes my life easier", I
realize they haven't ever used dpkg and the apt tools.

Anyway, it's also true that a base Debian install is MUCH smaller than a
base Red Hat installation (like, 50% with no real attempt to slim it
down).  Also, there is more flexibility at install-time in choosing which
packages get installed and which do not.

Subject: [PLUG] MySQL connection monitoring
Message-ID: <3D3F1A65.611C2CF4@truedisk.com>

Does anyone know how to get a MySQL server to report the 
number of connections currently in use?

I learned about the "max_connections" variable in MySQL the
hard way -- by having PHP scripts bomb on a live system.
Now, I would like to monitor the connection usage, so I can
crank the  value up if getting near the ceiling.

I can view the max_connections settings with:
  
  mysqladmin variables | grep max_connections

And get a vague estimate (assume 1 connection per thread) from:

  mysqladmin status

Is there anything more definitive?  (Heck, has anyone built
any cool MRTG config files and scripts for MySQL?)

Thanks,
- Don

I have a couple of other suggestions for this:

1. Some ISPs locally have partnerships with others through things like iPass
and other ways so that you can dial a local ISP wherever you end up. Some of
these partnerships are limited, you kind of have to call around.

2. Sign up with a place like Yahoo! to get your mail. They do offer a 'check
other mail' option and (as of now) you don't have to pay extra for it.

3. Sign up with a less evil ISP like Earthlink

Other than that, there might be other ways that you can do it, but those are
my suggestions based on tech support for the local ISP joints and answering
this exact question a lot of times.

I would guess that the larger dialup ISPs would have POPs all over the 
place. When my wife was doing some work for Boeing she was able to get 
a discounted account through GTE.net/Verizon.net. She still has the 
account and has dragged her laptop to various places around the country 
and has always found a local POP number. 

My wife uses Win98 but I've had a Linux system dial-in and connect to 
Version.net without any problems. I used the modem setup in YaST2 under 
SuSE and created multiple providers. With the modem setup, I get this 
little "plug" icon in the system panel of the KDE desktop once the 
modem and provider stuff was setup. Once the little "plug" thing is 
started, the modem automatically dials the specified provider that I 
have selected when outgoing packets are detected. 

If I right mouse-click in the "plug" icon when the connection is 
disconnected, I can change the provider being called. I think wvdial is 
used as part of this magic setup. I've gotten lazy over the years and 
am happy to set the modem stuff up using YaST2. In my old Slackware 
days I wrote shell scripts, chat scripts and used "diald" to get "pppd" 
to an automatic PPP connection when outgoing packets were detected.

The downside is even though the number is local, many hotels charge for 
local calls so it's not necessarily a free phone call. Maybe that's 
different with an 800 number being called from a hotel room. I guess 
too that if it's a single 800 number then setting things up is alot 
easier since multiple POP numbers are not required. I usually do some 
research and setup my wife's laptop before she leaves on a trip so the 
new POP numbers have been added to the dialup setup. Windows is pretty 
flexible here and multiple locations can be specified and profiles can 
be setup to dial 9 to get an outside line through the hotel's PBX 
system. I know I can do this in SuSE as well but the setup just isn't 
as easy as Windows IMHO.  

As long as an ISP supports connection via PPP without some other cruft 
software being run it should be possible to get Linux to connect. And 
as long as the mail servers support standard protocols like POP3, SMTP, 
and/or IMAP Linux shouldn't work. Probably the biggest hassle is 
getting the modem and dialup providers setup. I didn't think this was 
too bad with SuSE's YaST2 but it wasn't as easy as setting up an 
ethernet card IMHO.

Jeme knows this, but I must add since it didn't occurr to him to mention
it... that the above applies to the standard installer, not to the PGI
based one.  The PGI install will land you a full Gnome desktop with a
fully configured X server, where the standard one is text based and
leaves you with a bare bones system most suitable as the base for a
server system.

This isn't an answer to your question, but it may help nonetheless.

You have a few options dealing with AOL under Linux.

1)  There's Wine.  It lets you dial up and 2.5 (likely 3.0 as well)
might get web access, but there is no external TCP/IP connectivity (ie;
external apps can't use the AOL connections).

2)  There's PengAOL.  A google search should bring it up.  It allows an
AOL connection to be made within Linux to give you *just* Internet
access... no access to AOL-only things.  It dropped out of active
development almost a year ago, but should still work fine.

3)  There's Gamera, the AOL Net Appliance client.  It may not be legal
to use, but it is still an option.  It works with only dialup to give
you a nearly full-blown AOL client.  I couldn't get it to use my modem
when I was in Mandrake oh-so-long-ago... but I didn't try very hard.  If
it helps, the Net Appliance itself uses a Conexant modem, so if the
Conexant kernel modules work funky (like only on a wierd com port) you
may need to do some symlinking in /dev  :-)

Hope this helps.

Rob

I should have mentioned... 

AOL runs just fine in Win4Lin and VMWare (both of which cost money).

Isn't it interesting that at PCC, at least a few years ago, I was told
that I cannot take a C++ class there and do the homework with the G++
compiler...  The textbook intro stated that the book taught only
ISO/ANSI standard C++.  Now if Microsoft's compiler, today, is more
non-compliant than G++ 3.0, then for certain it was at least as
non-compliant then.

Yes, in terms of standards compliance, VSC++ (not sure up to what
versions this is applicable, certainly 5 and probably 6, hopefully NOT
VS.NET) was just awful such things as

for (int i=0; i < some_num; ++i)
    do_something();
for (int i=0; i < other_num; ++i)
    do_something_else();

Would fail to compile because the scoping rules didn't fit the standard,
among other things (this is just one of the more frequent bugaboos you
encounter).

I installed a pretty bare-bones set of packages on my Debian/Alpha

I decided to install the gcc-3.0 package rather than 2.95 for a

rather than gcc -- which is fine, but I'd like to have a 'gcc' or 'cc 
in my $PATH.

There are all sorts of ways to accomplish this (a manual symlink or a
shell alias are the two that come to mind), but I thought I'd try 
using the update-alternatives facility instead.

So, what's the canonical way to add a 'cc' link to the alternatives
system and point it at gcc-3.0?

man update-alternatives

You could install both "vim" and "nvi", then look at what they do in
their "/var/lib/dpkg/info/PKG.postinst" files, for a sample.

One alternative I've noticed no one has mentioned is OpenMail, formerly
sold by HP, but now offered by Samsung. (Who, IIRC, also manufactures
the orphaned Alpha processor.)

It's a proprietary product that has clients for many OS's. Beyond that
I know nothing about it -- good, bad or indifferent. But I'd be interested
in hearing anyone's experiences with it.

Stephen,

I am currently using a 15" AOC LCD Display in redhat 7.3 without problems.  I 
wouldn't think you would have a problem with any current LCD, they work just 
like any standard VGA monitor in regards to the OS.  I've found that Costco 
usually has good deals on LCD's so you might try looking there.

Regards,
Jim Adams

You might check the handspring website - I'm sure they sell something

Another option is to pick up a USB card for $10 from Fry's.  Or maybe a 
USB2.0 card for ~$30ish?

Hi Jim,

Thanks for your advice.  Now it wipes out my doubt

What I am worrying is the driver which is required in Windows world.  Now 
the market is full of LCD displays.  Some of them carry driver for Windows 
which drives me to post my enquiry on this list.

Thanks again.

Stephen

Another web-based approach is to hook up with a local ISP that offers such
an option (like my provider, Aracnet: https://www.aracnet.com/mailman/ ).

  Thanks, Richard. Turns out they do make a serial charging cradle. Now the
problem is finding one. OfficeMax and Office Depot don't carry them and both
Best Buy and CompUSA don't answer their phones (auto answer Hell; can't get
to a human so I hung up on 'em). Now the net ...

I like lilo.  It's tried and true.  However, I'd go with whatever the
distro you're installing defaults to.  It makes life easier down the
road.  They should both be able to dual boot your system.  I've done
multiboots with both.

The answer depends on your machine and what you plan on doing with it; if
you value flexibility or experimenting with different OSes and kernel
images try grub:

"GRUB, unlike LILO, is able to read filesystems and recognize kernel
images too. While LILO requires the physical location of the kernel on
your drive, GRUB does not. Even the latest filesystem ReiserFS is
supported. This means that you don't have to re-install GRUB every time
you make a change to the config file or install a new kernel. If your BIOS
supports LBA then there is also no problem reading beyond 1024 cylinders.
There's some good support for network booting of diskless clients."

  I don't know, Anthony. But, I don't want to open the case and put in a
card, then see if I can get the interface working with the 2.2.19 kernel.

  After a bunch of calls, we went to Staples and bought the serial-sync
cradle for $18 (Handspring wants $50 for it!). It works only for
synchronizing, not charging, so we do need both cradles anyway. Sigh.

Thanks,

Rich

Well since you already have a solution this isn't going to help you now 
but maybe in the future...I have a 2.4.18 kernel on my primary 
workstation and I'm able to download images from my Kodak digital 
camera via USB using "gphoto2". It would seem to me that USB support is 
pretty solid in newer versions of the Linux kernel. 

I was a bit skeptical since I had never used any USB devices with Linux 
before but I was pleasantly surprised when I pressed the button on my 
camera's dock and my system beeps, and I see message in the syslog that 
shows that the hotplug stuff detected my camera. I even managed to get 
the hotplug stuff configured so I don't have to be root to access my 
camera through the USB port.

I admit I don't have any experience with a USB card since my mobo has 
USB ports on it already.

There are USB-serial adapters for mice, I could never get them to work,
the PC just does not see the mouse. I suggest buying a serial cradle for
Visor instead (the one it comes with is USB but you can buy a serial one).

Yeah, don't think the serial interface was ever designed to provide the 
current necessary to charge a battery.  If you haven't noticed, serial stuff 
is rapidly disappearing.  From motherboards, devices and accessories.  I was 
in a computer shop the other day that had zero DB-9 adaptors or cables. 
Seems hard to believe, but it looks like one better start hoarding.

Well, most of the time it's Karl (no offense, Karl) saying simply 
'apt-get install [packagename]'.  On one hand, I applaud his advocacy of 
Debian and GNU - on the other hand, it's not very helpful to the 'other 
distribution' users on the list.  Then again, I'm used to it, I use 
Debian, and so it doesn't bother me.

I try not to be distribution-specific, but sometimes you have to use the 
right tool for the job, and that tool is not always a Red Hat.  ;)

I tried setting up Grub.  I think there might be a problem with a 
post-lilo grub install...mine never seemed to work, no matter what I 
tried.  New kernels wouldn't load after reboot, and I once got the 
dreaded LI after POST.

YMMV, of course, but Rob speaks truly - go with whatever is the default 
bootloader your Distribution of Choice(tm) installs.  :)

Subject: [PLUG] power hit... am I screwed?
Message-ID: <20020724232617.A27582@aracnet.com>

The power failed while I was a work today. Fat lot of good the UPS did. I
tried rebooting my P-Pro S 200 (SMP) and it panics...

<detects Ultra 100TX2 controller>
hda: CD-ROM <etc>
hde: MAXTOR GL040J2 ATA DISK drive

hda: driver not present
VFS: Cannot open root device "hda3" or 03:03
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:03


So, then I tried booting into single user mode from (what I believe is) a
good boot floppy, and it bombs out with...

<lotsa stuff>
hde:hde lost interrupt
hde: lost interrupt
hde: lost interrupt
ide_dmsproc: chipset support ide_dms_lostirq func only 13:
<more stuff>
Kernel panic: No init found. Try passing init= option to kernel.


I (of course, *sigh*) don't have a backup - and can't afford to lose /var
(it's my web server). It's running (or was) RH7.2 - which didn't have ATA100
support in 2.4.2. I had to finagle the bagel to load it on my Maxtor by
attaching the drive to the onboard controller, then making and booting into
2.4.17 and then connecting the drive to the Promise controller. I've also
got the media for RH7.3. I'm wondering if I create a boot floppy for it (the
CD-ROM isn't bootable on this box) if I'd be able to simply do an upgrade.
I'd prefer to get the system back up as it was and do the upgrade as a
planned exercise.

I welcome any and all help here.

thanks,
Sandy

Sandy,
This idea may be a bit off, but have you got another box you can put the
drive in? It might just be readable, at least the important stuff.

OK, so this says it can't mount the root filesystem.

A single boot floppy?  Was this something like your distribution's "rescue
disk" or was this a single floppy system like Tom's Root Boot or similar
microdistribution?

If it's a rescue disk, it's just a kernel.  You'll still need to mount a
root filesystem to get your basic utilities like init, login, and a shell,
not to mention fsck.

Well, if you can't mount the filesystem, you can't get to init, can you?

(Is that earlier stuff a result of not having dma support in the floppy's
kernel?)

OK, any and all.  Hear me out before you dismiss this.

I'm not terribly familiar with all the various boot floppy options out
there, so I'll tell you what I'd do in such a pinch.

Hopefully you have a working system on which to do this.

Download the first two Debian install floppies (don't worry, I'm not
telling you to reinstall anything):

<URL: http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current/images-1.44/rescue.bin >
<URL: http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current/images-1.44/root.bin >

dd if=root.bin of=/dev/fd0 bs=512; sync
[swap floppies]
dd if=rescue.bin of=/dev/fd0 bs=512; sync

OK, now boot the broken system with the Rescue floppy.  When it asks for
the Root floppy, feed it that.

Hit enter at the prompt (I know, it says you're going to install something
or lose data, but you won't if you don't actually try).

When you get the Welcome! splash screen (curses interface), hit ALT+F2 and
hit enter to activate the virtual console.

>From there, you can fsck your drives and attempt to repair the
filesystems.

When you're done, just make sure the drives are unmounted, pop out the
floppy, and reboot the system normally.

Anyway, that's what I'd do.

The error says it can't find hda3 and you're using an off-board IDE controller,
hde3. So maybe using the boot parameter, ide=reverse at the boot prompt will
work. 

Thank you

A UPS will not help when the power outage is longer than your
battery reserves and you've not setup your system for power fail.
You need to connect your UPS to your computer with a signal cable,
run a power fail daemon (such as powerd), and check the power
fail settings in your /etc/inittab file.

Putting /var on a separate partition formatted with ext3 or Reiserfs
is also a good idea.

I've had mixed luck with the one USB -> serial adapter with which I've 
had experience, a Belkin F5U103. Greg K-H would, of course, be the 
expert on the subject (hey, Greg -- I see you're now a Linux Journal 
columnist; way to go!).

Our problem is that if the mouse is plugged into the USB-serial port,
everything works OK -- unless something is also plugged into the
native serial port; at that point, the USB-serial mouse disappears. 
Oddly, if the mouse is plugged into the native serial port, other 
serial devices can co-exist on the USB-serial port. I'm not sure why 
mice have such a hard time in that environment.

IOW, my experience is that only a hands-on test will tell you whether 
or not a USB-serial adapter will successfully host your cradling 
device.

Plus, you'll want to make sure that your kernel is relatively recent, 
since USB support gains ground with every release.

  I know that the 2.4 series has USB support (thanks, Greg!), but I don't
think it's in the 2.2 series. While the RH 7.3 cds sit on my desk since I
burned them a few weeks ago, I've not had the time to upgrade all three
machines.

Kyle,

  The configuration of the default cradle has a wire from the cradle to a
USB connector. There's a small power brick that plugs into the rear of the
USB connector so the charging juice comes from the wall outlet, not the
computer.

  My Kyocera QCP-6035 (Palm/cell phone) has a serial cradle with two wires
coming out the back: one goes to the computer's serial port for syncing, the
other to a small power brick for charging. So, the technology is proven and
Handspring could have offered that as a no-cost option if they cared.

  Just curiosity, but I would like to learn and understand.

Okay, got it.  It's worth checking the discount table at places like 
OfficeMax (if you're already there, that is).  Found a charger for a Palm 
IIIc for $2.  I don't own one, but at that price...

Unfortunately, my other linux box is all SCSI based (dual boot w/W2K). I'm
considering buying a second HD for the P200 Pro, doing a fresh install of
RH7.3 on it, and seeing if I can mount the partitions from the original
drive and cp what I need.

It was created with mkbootdisk after I made and booted the 2.4.17 kernel on
my RH7.2 distro.

I've tried booting into rescue mode, fscking /dev/hde{1-3,5,6,8} and then
trying the upgrade to RH7.3. It tells me I didn't shut down cleanly and need
to fsck. I've also tried the rescue mode procedure and simply rebooting,
letting grub select the kernel - it didn't change the errors I was already
getting. Same goes for rescue followed by booting from the boot disk *sigh*.

I've tried specifying the kernel and initrd via grub, still no go.

I believe it's because I may have created the boot disk *before* changing
the HD from the onboard controller to the Ultra 100 TX2 (after upgrading
from 2.4.2 to 2.4.17 to get support for the controller). I only needed to
adjust swap in fstab thanks to grub.

Undoubtedly good advice, Jeme. But I suspect it will come to the same end as
my efforts using Red Hat's rescue mode, which allowed me to fsck. I'm
thinking now of getting a second HD for that system, doing a clean install
of RH7.3 (which ought to support the controller without any finagling) and
then seeing if I can recover my data from the current HD.

Thanks very much for your suggestions.

That I did already (ext3 and /var on its own mount point). Hopefully I'll be

What it looks like to me is that whatever boot floppy or kernel you are 
using to boot with does NOT have the ata-100 driver (promise?) 
installed.  I've gone through the exact same issues, and what saved my 
bacon was finding a boot floppy image with the drivers I needed.

I'm not sure if the images that Jeme pointed you to have those - I 
haven't created a 'current' set of boot floppies in a while - but I'm 
sure the RH7.3 disks have an image you could use at the very least.

I would try that before giving up the ghost and reinstalling with new 
hardware.

Excerpt from the SquidGaurd FAQ:

squidGuard does not block? 

    There my be at least 2 reasons for this: 
    
    You didn't end your pass rules with "none". Pass rules ends with an

    squidGuard goes into emergency mode. Reasons may be syntax errors in

    filprotection problems or missing directories. Check the squidGuard
    log. 
    Note:When run under Squid, squidGuard is run with the same user and
    group ID as Squid (cache_effective_user and  cache_effective_group
    in squid.conf). The squidGuard configuration and database files must

That's my guess, too. And Promise doesn't have a driver for the Ultra I can
dd at boot time. They only have one for the FastTrack.

I tried it with both the boot.img from the RH7.3 distro and the mkbootdisk I
created on my RH7.3 system (which, of course, didn't work since it's a
different config altogether). Unless somebody has another idea, I'm SOL.
Looks like I'll have to stop by CompUSA on the way home from work (Frye's is
way out of my way). Then I'll have to figure out how to fsck and mount the
original HD when I cable it up *after* installing RH7.3 on the new drive.

An odd difference that is sometimes important to me.  You can switch OSs
remotely with LILO.  I haven't found a way to do that in GRUB.

VNC in to my work machine.  While the work machine is in Linux

 lilo -R windows  
 reboot

The -R tells lilo to boot in to windows only once.  After that it
uses the default boot.  So with the above, the work machine reboots
in to windows.  Where VNC is again running.   When done with windows,
I just reboot and it comes back to Linux.

Can grub do this?

What about compiling a kernel for it and just using that to boot up?

Well, are you able to boot from floppy and mount any of the filesystems
on the drive?  The debian boot disk should be able to do that, a
Slackware 8.0 boot/root combo should be able to do that (as would an 8.1
but it's six disks for boot/root)... or Tom's mini distro disk
thingimibob that's out there should be able to do that.

>From there I wonder if you could chroot yourself into your disk and
compile yerself a new kernel (or use a [bleh!] precompiled kernel) and
maybe re-initialize Grub (or install lilo, I like lilo, although I've
seen many advantages of booting with grub) to be sure the MBR is doing
good.

That's if your kernel has gone bad.  If it's a bad filesystem, then you
just try and fix it good enough to boot again (get yourself a new
kernel?)...

But then, I've never dealt with a dead filesystem before, so y'all are
probably more adept at this stuff than I.  It's hard to tell what to do
when you aren't *actually there*.  :-)

Since it is trying to read the root file system from hda3, why not
unplug your cd-rom and plug the maxtor into that controller (I'm
assuming that your root is on the 3rd partition)?  It looks like GRUB
lost the ide=reverse kernel option.  (I think there are advantages to
having the kernel options stored in the boot record, lilo style.)

How do you do that? I'd think it would be changing the default OS in the

I suspect that it may be due to the fact that the mail server
documentation and websites about UCE are in English, and that the
language barrier makes it difficult for them to not only discover the
existance of this knowledge set, but also to read about it.

You didn't do it right.

If you still see LI, that means that you never installed Grub's MBR
(master boot record) program.  Lilo's is still there and cannot find the
rest of LILO where it used to find it.

I've had trouble in the past with "grub-install", and have learned to do
it "by hand", like this:

cd /boot
mkdir grub
cd grub
cp /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/* .
grub

 Ok, now I'm in the grub shell, hopefully.

Let's say that /boot resides on /dev/hda1.  Here's what I type to
install grub:

grub> setup (hd0) (hd0,0)

... output here ...

grub> quit

Now it should reboot to a grub shell, unless I've created a 
"/boot/grub/menu.lst".  Also, if your "/boot" is on it's own partition;
that is, "/boot" is a mount point, then you also must do:

cd /boot
ln -s . boot

... to get Grub to find the menu.lst file.

Please read the grub texinfo documentation (info grub) from cover to
cover before attempting this procedure.

He actually described it exactly in the same email you quoted here.

No, that is pointless because you don't necessarily have access to the
configuration file to get BACK after the switch.

With LILO, you simply pass the -R switch and tell LILO which stanza in the
lilo.conf should be used for the NEXT boot.  When you reboot, lilo will
then use the options from that stanza and then revert to the default
configuration.

So, in the case the original poster described, you are using GNU/Linux
with a MS Windows partition on the same system and lilo is configured to
boot the first by default and the second by a stanza titled "windows".

You can be connected to the GNU/Linux system via ssh or vnc or whatever,
type `lilo -R windows` at a root prompt, then reboot the system.

When the system boots, it will use the "windows" section of lilo.conf and
then revert to the usual default setting.  The system boots into MS
Windows (where this fellow is also running VNC).  When the system is
rebooted (via VNC or whatever), then it boots normally with the GNU/Linux
system as default.

Very handy, I would think, for folks with multi-boot systems.

I'd be kind of shocked if grub didn't do this and folks still claimed it's
superior.

Actually it's not quite so.
Being myself from Central Asia,I would say who cares 
if you mail server relays everybody in any direction.
It's very convenient to setup one day .com store, 
fly by night dating service for foreign fulls or
a spam generator.
People over there are desperate to get a buck or even 
glimse of bucks by any possible means. 
All these servers often with lengthy domaim names are 
running pirated M$ software except Linux of course.
There are very small percent of people who have computers
and even smaller percent who have any kind of access 
to the internet.
It's a grey and wild internet area.
In my mail setting I always block .tw .ru .uz .ur .kz 
and other asian domans to reduce a spam level.

That thought has occurred to me. I'm going to give that a try before I try
the plastic "fix". If I can get booted up via the onboard controller, I can
make the adjustments necessary to reboot with the Promise.

Yep I went through great efforts to avoid paying $40.00 a pop from APC 
for signaling cables for my BackUPS units. I made my own for a couple 
dollars in parts from a second-hand electronic. I also put together a 
monitoring daemon based-on code from the UPS-HOW that works with the 
dumb APC BackUPS units.

The daemon signals when the power goes out and when the power is 
restored assuming the system is still up. I'm real conservative so I 
don't drain the battery to low and use a 2 minute timed shutdown that 
shuts a system down if the power isn't restored. If the power is 
restored before the shutdown commences the shutdown is canceled. So far 
this setup has worked pretty well since most timess the power goes out 
for a few seconds or has a momentary sag so the shutdown is canceled 
and the system continues to run.

I also had a Tripp-Lite unit from Costco that also included a signaling 
cable and monitoring software for Linux but there was some problem with 
the charging of the battery. After a few weeks there was a noticable 
bubbling sound, burning smell, and finally a whistling sound like gas 
was venting from the battery or something. The fault light also came on 
the unit and so back to Costco it went. After after leaving Costco I 
headed to my favorite computer store with my return money and ordered a 
more expernsive APC SmartUPS unit.

The APC SmartUPS unit I got included the signaling cable and also a 
version of APC's Powerchute software that even had a version for Linux 
on the CD. I got a newer version of PowerChute off of APC's website.

I don't think grub provides any direct analog to 'lilo -R'; the 
closest thing is a simple swapping of the 'default' directive in 
grub.conf, but it's not really the same thing since the setting would 
remain in force even after the first reboot.

Without making any claims of superiority for grub vis-a-vis lilo, it's 
worth mentioning what grub can do that lilo (afaik) can't:

* hide partitions from this or that operating system
* grab a boot image off the network via tftp
* provide a fallback kernel
* pause to prompt user to do something (e.g., insert a floppy) during
  the boot process
* store bootloader password in strong (md5) crypto format and prompt 
  for password at place of your choosing
* allow user to alter kernel parameters at boot time
* allow kernels to be represented in boot menu by titles of arbitrary
  length, including whitespace

This isn't meant to disparage lilo in any way; it served me well for 
many years.

I think it would be great if this bill passed for the reasons stated by the 
author (of the article).  It would seem to conflict with other legislation 
and bring back the wild wild west.  Defensive hacking seems justified to me. 
  But probably illegal as was discussed a few months ago on this list re: 
sircam or was it nimda?

IANAL, but I believe in many states, you wouldn't be prosecuted if you shot 
someone in your house armed or not, if it's plausible you felt your life was 
in danger.  But let's not go there, m'kay?

My wife has a system with Win2K Server on it and you can filter ports on 
it at least. I have port scanned the Win2K system on our home network 
with "nmap" and all I can say is I'm glad it sits behind a Linux-based 
firewall. The system is presently in its default configuration with no 
port filtering being done at all. A Linux system with services running 
an no unfiltered ports would also be worrisome.

This may be a bit mis-leading to the beginner.
"Installation" here means typing "lilo" at the (root) command prompt,
which re-"installs" the loader into the boot track at the head of
the disk, or partition.


It's not like you're installing the gcc compiler from source.

So I would not base my decision on GRUB vs LILO on this alone (which
you were not).

I read an article some time ago (sorry, can't remember source or
media) that discussed various aspects of computer vandalism and the like.
One of those interviewed was an, um, Enforcer, for a large un-named company.

When they are broken into (which now happens rarely) they withhold no
expense in tracing and tracking the perpetrator.  And when they find
him (often some pimple-faced teenager in his bedroom) he and a couple
others pay a surreptitious visit to the perp's place of residence.

Let us say just say that it is a _long_ time until said perp breaks
into any computers again.  No physical violence to the person (the
first time).  But his computer and it's surrounding domain become a
vivid testimony against goofing around with _this_ company.

I don't know which is sadder: people who resort to vigilante tactics

Could you imagine if computer scientists or software engineers where in
charge of law making and enforcement.

"No I'm sorry, this democratic system is intractable, lets give the
president root privledges, he can make these decisions in constant time."

Or

"We're sorry, but it seems there was a bug in the 2000 election.  Applying

It's just that it is a lot easier to install an already built and
debugged package than to mess around learning to build it yourself,
especially when you have work to do an no time to muck with it.  They
ask questions about how to do things that should have already been
solved for them, once and for all, by the distribution package
maintainer.

Somewhat implicit in this is that if you insist on building your own,
often a good way to get at a known working configuration and patch set
is to download the .diff.gz from Debian and see what they did.

Edit /etc/inittab... you want to change the line that says

id:4:initdefault:

to say

id:3:initdefault:

(or something else if you want a different default)

Hope this helps!

You can do a <CTRL>-<ALT<-<F1> to get to a text console, login and root 
and then place the system into runlevel 3 by running the command:

"init 3". 

You can also edit your systems /etc/inittab file and change the default 
runlevel. You should see a line similar to below. Change the 5 to a 3 
and your system will default to runlevel 3 rather than 5:

# default runlevel
id:5:initdefault:

 I think you are looking at this all wrong!
 This law could cause a great expansion in the hiring of hackers,
IT and store clerks.

   ***************************
   *    WANTED!! HACKERS!@!  *
   *     Destroy Networks    *
   *    Legally with .gov    *
   *    approval and judges  *

   *   INTERNET time and     * 
   *   all the MP3's you     *
   *   always dreamed of.    *
   ***************************

 Of course, IT personnel will get overtime to fix all those
destroyed and hacked boxes. With the complete abolishment
of copyright infringement more people will buy CD's and DVD's
at stores. Also with all the worms, Trojans and hacked boxes
just think of all the computer service calls that will be needed. 

 Hell! Let us expands this to all text and pictures. If it could
be infringement then I say destroy it first and then ask questions. 
If someone responds to an email or usenet post and don't use the
_fair use_ guidelines set down by the courts you can destroy that 
copyright infringers computer. It will be just like the wild west!
  
 God Bless these congress men and women that want to help
stop copyright infringement, destroy the INTERNET and increase
the number of employment opportunities in America. 
Osama Bin Laden will just have to wait while we clean up the INTERNET.

Rich,

I don't necessarily think that Windows/Microsoft based servers running open 
relay.  For example I have been recently using xmail (www.xmailserver.org), a 
somewhat popular cross-platform mail server.  By default it is open relay, 
and the documentation doesn't specifically state how to turn it off.  I had 
to ask around before I found out that in order to turn off open relay you 
have to restrict relay capabilities to your location range in a config file.  
This seems like a rather roundabout way of doing it IMHO, and it's not well 
documented that this is the correct way to turn relay off.

Regards,
Jim Adams

How ELSE would you do it?

What we call an "open relay" is just a system that relays mail regardless
of source.  Unless you specify somewhere the systems to which you'd like
to restrict relay capabilities, you're on open relay.  If the system
DOESN'T allow relay from some sources, then it is just a local mail
agent... what good is that on the internet?

I suppose you're right, it does make sense that restricting "relay"
turns off "open relay".  It just didn't seem intuitive that when you
told it authenticate smtp clients it would still be an open relay server
because relay was set to allow 0.0.0.0.  

Also as I mentioned before no where in the documentation did it say
"Warning: By default this server is open relay, to turn it off do..." 
This comes back to the original question of "why are there so many open
relay servers?"  In this case it could be a combination of poor docs and
slackerish(is that a word) admins.

I removed some parts of the original. I'm to lazy to paraphrase.

Thank you
Russell 

http://www.xfree86.org/4.2.0/mouse5.html#23   
-----------------------------------------------------

Option"ZAxisMapping""N1 N2 N3 N4"

For a mouse with two wheels, of which, the second wheel is used to generate
horizontal scroll action, and the mouse which has a knob or a stick which can
detect the horizontal force applied by the user. The motion of the second wheel
will be mapped to the buttons N3, for the negative direction, and N4, for the
positive direction. If the buttons N3 and N4 actually exist in this mouse,
their actions won't be detected by the X server.

NOTE #1: horizontal movement may not always be detected by the current version
of the XFree86 X servers, because there appears to be no accepted standard as
to how the horizontal direction is encoded in mouse data.

NOTE #2: Some mice think left is the negative horizontal direction, others may
think otherwise. Moreover, there are some mice whose two wheels are both
mounted vertically, and the direction of the second vertical wheel does not
match the first one's.

Currently this option can not be set in the XF86Setup program. You need to edit
the XF86Config file by hand to add this option.

Hi All Folks,

Thanks for your advice.

Problem is now solved.

I use GRUB.  The PC boots automatically leaving me no way to input any 
command.  It stops at Login screen, I suppose, because I could not read a 
vibrating white threads screen.  Crtl + Alt +F2 switch the screen to TEXT 
MODE.  From there I execute "Xconfigurator".  That is all.

My aged monitor supports 24 bit colour depth and a resolution of 800x600 max.

Message-ID: <3D417128.8050707@sun.com>

When I set up my first linux server - RedHat 5.2 - Sendmail was 
configured, BY DEFAULT, to relay mail from *anywhere*.  Only when I 
recieved a peice of spam that seemed to come from my own box did I 
realize what was wrong and took steps to correct it.

About a year ago, there was someone from Russia asking for linux 
distribution donations here on this list.  Some of the donated 
distributions could have been configured just as mine had been, and as 
someone else mentioned, the howto's are generally written in english, 
not russian.  Perhaps all of the open relays are simply older 
distributions with insecure default mail configurations?

I can easily imagine a newbie doing just this and then forgetting about 
it...  Especially if they have an ISP they use for mail and don't bother 
with the imap/pop services their new server has available for them.

Thankfully, the distribution creators figured this out and fixed it in 
the newer versions.  At least...I HOPE they have.  We can only hope that 
some of these relays eventually upgrade, and the configuration problems 
they had 'go away'.  Of course, that would be in a near-perfect world.  ;)

Thanks, Russell.  I didn't see the "extended-status" command.
This helps greatly.  (Won't be quite as much fun to plot as
a count of actual connections, but at least we can see ourselves
approaching a melt-down.)

The way I read it, unless otherwise configured, it would relay for all. In 
other words, the default behavior is to relay everything, regardless.

Seems to me that's backwards. It should be relay for none, then the admin 
specifies who to allow.

Same as firewalls. "Deny all, allow some".

Well since I saw this question earlier and no one has responded to
either, I'll take a shot.  I'm going to venture a guess and say that it
is, at the moment, not possible.  Sadly, X typically only supports up to
5 mouse buttons, which is just fine for your typical wheeled mice (1,2,3
4 and 5 are bound to the wheel), but those of us with other mice, say
the A4 Tech or my own Logitech MouseMan+ (with the thumb button) are
SOL.  You may be able to hack it using the XInput drivers rather than
the usual mouse driver, but I wouldn't know where to begin or even if
it's worth investigating.

As long as we're talking about issues contributing to open relays, look at
older versions of MS mail servers.

FWIW, not so long ago the Internet Messaging Service (or
whateverthehelltheycalledit) on Exchange didn't even have the capability of
controlling relays.  It was an open relay by default AND THERE WAS NO OPTION
TO CHANGE IT.  (At least nowhere in the standard configuration tools.)  What
a crock.  5.5 eventually put out a service pack giving you that kind of
control.  Probably because their customers were complaining about being put
in "black hole" listings. :)

To make matters worse, you couldn't find the word "relay" in documentation
anywhere... not even the index.  All third-party big-buck manuals I saw had
the same problem.  Actually, even the most recent 5 inch thick Exchange 2000
book I've seen didn't even have the term relay in the index.  To figure out
how to manage relaying, you had to piece together information from many
different places.  (Of course, using unintuitive MS terminology and trying
to guess what actually constitutes "relaying".)

No wonder there are so many open relays... in the MS world at least, "relay"
often barely even shows up in the lexicon.

And they have the gall to claim it is an email server. If you ask me, it's a
freaking groupware medusa-hydra beast, with something kindof resembling
email sortof bolted on the side.  :)

Just in case you want a overview of relaying with Exchange server:

And a good resource for dealing with Exchange server overall:

http://www.swinc.com/resource/exchange.htm

It's taken Microsoft a long time to get Exchange 5.x right, but I'd go so
far as to call it a mature groupware product with e-mail bolted on the side.

Hello Everyone!

I have searched all around nut I have not bee able to find job splitting
software for printing.

I want to have a linux box that is a print server and run samba to connect
my windoze boxes and be able to break up a large mail merge (or other lare
jod) over more than one printer.

Do a program like this exist?

Thanks,

Jeremy

It isn't very useful, but here's how to get XF86 4.x to at least see the
additional buttons;

<warning, long url ahead>

http://www.linuxnewbie.org/nhf/Hardware/Configuring_the_Intellimouse_Explorer_in_XFree86.html

It definitely isn't very graceful.  Hopefully the X devs will come up
with a way to better use the addition buttons some day, some where.  :-)

Other than 'split' I can't think of one. I can just think of the myriad
problems that can introduce (eg. splitting the job in the middle of
non-printable PCL control codes).

Best bet - get a really good fast printer.

I've been trying to determine why some packets are going back and forth
across my internet links, and find I need some information that I can't
seem to find an easy way to acquire.  Before I resort to writing software,
does anyone know of a way to track which process (or even user id) last
used a given port (primarily udp and tcp).  The problem is that I'll see a
packet go out from a dynamically allocated port, but once the transaction
completes (in well under a second), the port is freed, so I have no way of
telling what process/user was generating the packets.  Packet sniffers and
iplogger are helpful, but don't appear to provide a means of connecting
the packets back to the source process/program on the local system, or did
I miss something?

Anyone got any ideas?

You might be looking in the wrong place, it's been awhile since I've seen
this, but some print servers allow you to define a single printer frontend
to a group of printers, so if you send multiple jobs to the "printer" it
will split them between the actual printers.  Of course if your mail
merge (or other program) won't allow you to do the merge as multiple
individual print jobs, this won't help, but all of the programs I can
recall using do allow this (I did it with OpenOffice two weeks ago).  I
always run merges as individual print jobs in case a problem develops,
that way only the current piece is messed up, rather than the rest of the
merge.

I'm responding to this not because I have a solution, but because I want
one too...  That would be analagous to exec_ logging for users.  Could
be very useful, albeit an extremely large amount of data to parse if you
logged it all.  

Let's see if anyone has an authoratative take on this... :)

Subject: [PLUG] Open relays for spammers
Message-ID: <51AE6EA505FCD111AB5600805F653ACB010AA252@exchange.ci.albany.or.us>

I just remember how flabbergasted I was when a person running an Exchange
server asked me if I knew any reasons some emails were being bounced back,
and if I knew what RTBL meant.

"You mean that mail server is an open relay?!"

"Huh?"

"Let's go fix this, shall we?"  *Poke and prod icky server*  "OMG, there's
not even an option to turn it off!" *Dumbfounded look on face*  "I can't
believe they shipped something like this.  Well, maybe I can... but I still
don't believe this!"

It was fixed long ago, as soon as it was possible to do so.  But it still
gives me the heebie-jeebies.

Speaking of relays, now there is a different problem with it... there is now
an internal server that it *should* relay for.  And is configured to relay
for (by IP under "Hosts and clients with these IP addresses")... but it
doesn't.  (I've read those docs before, and looked it over.  It does look
like it is set up right, but it certainly doesn't work.  Looked at it via
telnet from that server, and it is rejected.  "Relay not allowed or
whatever".  Figures. :)

They're not suprised at all, but don't want to mess with it until they get
the Exchange 2000 server up and everything hunky-dory.  Of course there is
no-such-thing as a non-Exchange email server to some persons.  So in the
meantime I don't get my relay.  *sigh*.

I don't trust Exchange as far as I can throw it.  I'm no wimp, but it IS a
very big machine. :)

Yes,  Exchange has poor docs and the method in the docs does not work to
stop relaying,  which is on by default in Exchange.
You must find a tutorial on closing the relaying that is written by admins
who have achieved it,  like NTfaq.com

Shannon:

If you're quick, you might be able to get an lsof listing to show you the
offending program.  Since your program completes so quickly, this will
just be a matter of luck on getting lsof to be running when the program
opens its connection.  I find that a nice "while true" loop does a decent
job, though it's kind of hard on the system.

If you can afford to disrupt the traffic, an invalid static route for the
destination of those mystery packets sometimes helps hold the connection
open long enough for lsof to collect the information.  (I.e. the packet
gets dropped and the TCP connection needs to time out, keeping it open
longer than if it completed successfully.)

The other option (which is *way* more hackerly) would be to modify the
tcp_output.c portion of the kernel to log all connect() calls and build a
new tcp-logging kernel.  This is probably best done from the console.  
;-)  The hard part would be figuring out how to get access to the calling
program's process table structures from within the TCP kernel code.

Good luck!

Thanks.  I got my firewall running about a month ago based around the
IPMasq "Strong" example.  I modified it in several places to do other
things I wanted.

I thought about checking out fwbuilder, but I got my own script set up
to do everything I want now... and it is easy to change things should I
want to.  :-)

I just got a new (er, used) computer: dual P-III, SCSI 160, .5GB RAM 
-- much more powerful than my old Celeron 333 (not that I really need 
all that power :-).

It's got an IBM 36GB drive that has one odd feature: every once in a 
while, it makes a mild squealing noise for 3 to 4 seconds:

* the activity light doesn't flash during that period
* it seems to happen only when the system is idle
* it seems completely unrelated to OS activity since it happened
  once while I was doing stuff in the BIOS setup menus

Someone off-list suggested it might happen because the drive is 
programmed to sweep its platters every so often just so no crud ends 
up on them.

Has anyone heard of this?

You can grab it from Debian, or from www.pdxlinux.org:

... and type "rute" in the search box at the bottom of the left panel.

Lots of older SCSI drives thermally recalibrate frequently, that's 
probably what it is.  Nothing to worry about (unless you could cook
and egg on it...).  I haven't seen a newer one do it in a few years,
but it's not surprising.  The bigger and faster, the louder.

I have a 36GB Ultra-160 IBM drive in my system I haven't noticed those 
sorts of sounds. It may be that since my system is an Athlon system in 
a tower case and has no less than 5 fans in the thing that I may have 
too much fan noise to hear this behavior from the drive. I do hear the 
sound of the R/W heads moving when the drive is being accessed.

I don't know how well it will work but one way to get this in a loop is
with the watch command.

watch -n 0 netstat --tcp --udp -lp >> logfile

It will run watch pretty fast, but slowenough that it doesn't take over
you CPU completely...Or if you want to watch the output as it happens
there is a nice command tee.

watch -n 0 netstat --tcp --udp -lp | tee logfile.

Note: I didn't test them so I can't gaurantee they work.

/cdrom doesn't work, mount says I need to be root to run mount.

Good idea.  That would do the same thing as my suggested "lsof" loop, but
it would run faster and less intrusively.

Or for even less overhead and disk usage, create a FIFO, and read from that
continuously.  You could then include/exclude  whatever you want, grep for
the PID of the program, look up the owner of the process, have it return that
and the terminal they logged in on.

Could you describe the process of creating and using the FIFO in more
detail.  I would like to know how to do that, but have never seen it
before.

Thanks,
Jason

If you can define the traffic enough to identify it, I assume you can
filter for it.  It is simple enough to use tcpdump writing raw traffic
to a file (just make sure to increase snaplen enough to get the
*whole* packet w/ payload, not just the header).
If nothing else you can do a raw of all traffic on that interface.


Even assuming it is a raw TCP session examining the payload should
give you a good idea of the application.  Reconstructing the full
bi-dir stream even more.


As mentioned in the thread, the BSD accounting option in the kernel
would be useful.  grab the tools, and you get a nice timestamped log
of every proc including name, uid, walltime, cpu timer, etc.  That
compared with timestamped tcpdump logs...

By the time the print job is sent from the windows station to and
queued for printing on the SAMBA server the job is already in printer
specific binary format (assuming it is not a native postscript
printer).  The split *must* be done *before* job submission, after
submission it has already been paginated and converted.

This approach would have worked for the latest irritation that I was
trying to track down, because the problem was occuring multiple times per
minute, and while it had occurred to me to try this, it most likely will
not work for another problem I have been trying to track down because it
only once every few hours for a day or so, then goes away (sometimes for
weeks), then shows up again.  Basically this loop approach is a
statistical method, eventually things will time out so that you capture
one, but, I'm trying to find a general solution that will work for the
rare packets as well.  I say this would have worked, because after
several days of irritation, the problem went away (more on that below)
before I could capture it.

This is one that hadn't occurred to me, I'll have to give it a try.

Given what I do for a living, I'm more than up to the "way more hackerly"
aspect, but I hate reinventing the wheel (aside from being both busy and
lazy :-) so I was hoping someone else had already done something along
these lines, or some similar alternative approch.

To create a FIFO (also called a named pipe), use the mkfifo command,
something like:

   mkfifo <some_arbitrary_file_name>

This creates on your file system a pipe, similar to what you get when you
pipe the output of one command into another such as "ls -l | less"
the difference is that the pipe has a name and is attached to your file
system.  To make use of the pipe, you can simply redirect the ouput of a
command to it, then have another command read from it like this:

  mkfifo /var/tmp/shannons_pipe
  cat /etc/passwd >/var/tmp/shannons_pipe &
  cat </var/tmp/shannons_pipe

this is obviously a stupid and trivial example, but fifos are often used
for things like a simple way for a daemon to provide status information,
or to pass data between independent processes (that may be running as
different users).  One thing to be aware of, once the pipe is full the
process which is filling it may block (if that is how it's I/O handling is
written), until some process is attached to the other end and starts
reading data from the pipe.

While this will give me access to the packets, so far as I'm aware, it
will not give me information on the process which generated the packets,
and I don't think it will give me anything the packet sniffers

Actually, this is what I have been doing, the problem is that what I am
trying to track down is sending very generic packets and doesn't give any
real clues.  The packets I was dealing with today were DNS lookups and
ICMP errors (relating to the DNS lookups), but they weren't coming from
the DNS server (I shut it down just to be sure), and I can't figure out
who was making the request, email was my first guess, but I scanned all
email messages and log files and found no references to the IP addresses
or domains that were involved in this.  Unfortunately (or fortunately
depending on your perspective), when I restarted BIND, the problem went
away.

The intermittent packets that I mentioned previously are unfortunately
even more generic, they are TCP echo requests (not ICMP)

With regard to the BSD accounting, I'm afraid I don't know much about it's
capabilities, so I'll have to look into this, but if it can just give a
simple time stamped record of processes and their ports, that might be
sufficient when coupled with a filtering packet sniffer.

Thanks to everyone for their suggestions, by using some of these, it looks
like I just might be able to remain lazy and avoid writing code! :-)

The Sharp Zaurus 5500D can. I have one that I like a whole lot. its a
bit geeky for most PDA users, but I would imagine most linux users would
love it. If I make it to this months meeting, I'll bring it along.Sharp
has also reduced the price $100 so they are quite reasonable now. And
you have to love a PDA with bash, perl, tcpdump, apache,opera and much
more.

You can't except for 3 ways:

1) give them root
2) use a restricted SAM ( sam -r)
3) use sudo

I work with hpux quite a bit so let me know if you need any more help.
HP-UX considers mounting to be mounting a filesystem and even changing
the permissions on mount wont help you.

If the /cdrom directly is the correct directory to mount the cdrom
then you will have to ask the sysadmin to allow you to use the
mount command on cdrom.

I should interject that using HP's "pfs_mount" can result in the entire
system crashing or hanging.  More frequently, it just grabs your CD so
that you can't eject it except using the "manual override", which of
course means that you can't mount a new one and any process that touches
the directory where it was mounted will hang.

My preferred method of mounting CDs on an HP box is via NFS from a linux
or Sun box.  ;-)  Maybe someday HP will abandon their asinine system for
mounting Rock Ridge CDs, but I'm not holding my breath.

Let me know how it goes.  Since the connection is TCP based (those TCP
echoes) this will probably hold it open for at least 5 seconds, and
possibly as long as 30 seconds.

Setting IPchains to drop the offending packets also works, and may even
work better since linux tends to be very quick about sending back a
"destination unreachable" ICMP on static routes.

The BSD process accounting lets you record the date/time every process
starts and stops.  Check the docs for the "psacct" RPM on disk 3 of RedHat
7.3 (if that's what you're using.)

This data would need to be correlated with your packet trace in order to
be useful, and I'm not sure that psacct has a fine enough granularity to
really help.  (I.e. I think it only records the process start time to the
nearest second, maybe even just to the nearest minute.)

I think it's more likely that the lsof or netstat methods will succeed.

Another option that might work:

Run "tcpdump" with the "-c" option and some carefully chosen filters so
that it exits after capturing one packet, then run "netstat -ap"
immediately afterwards.  This would make a nice little trigger for
whatever is causing you grief.  For example I just ran:

# tcpdump -c 1 icmp && netstat -ap --ip

And in another window I did:

$ ping <host>

And the first window showed a bunch O crap with this little gem at the
end:

raw        0      0 <ip omitted>:icmp        *:*                     7
3051/ping

Sure enough, that was my ping.

Good hunting!

So you're saying that they're $299 now instead of $399? (for the non-developer
version that has 64MB? - they had a developer version that had only 32MB)

My apologies for being off-topic, but I'm a bit frightened by the prospect
of being stuck using cybercafes for somewhat sensitive transactions.

I'll be in Ireland for three months and have to depend on cybercafes for
internet access. I have two shell accounts on Linux boxen here that I can
can only access using an ssh login, and the cybercafes I have to use run a
M$ OS. How does one launch an ssh login session from one of these things?
Will ssh2 likely be already on these boxes? Any special security
considerations, since I don't have control over these M$ boxes or their
networks?

Secondly, I have to access my bank's website too. Would accessing these
pages from a cybercafe's browser pose special security considerations?
Would one browser be any safer than another? Would it be safer to ssh into
my shell account here, then launch a local browser? I think I can do the
banking with Lynx, but not sure yet.

The original list price for the 64 MB version was $499. I got mine for
in the $470 range the week after it came out. They now list for $399,
but you can find them as low as $320 ( esp at BestBuy since they are not
going to carry them any longer. They signed a limited unit contract)

To be fair, the unit has gotten some bad reviews esp for syncing issues
and lack of third party software. Most of those reviewers ignored the
quantity of open Source software available. I really enjoy that it has
OpenSSH and I can admin my systems as well as a lot of other neat
features only a geek could love ( tcpdump, a port scanner, nmap, VNC,
samba, nfs. perl, python ...the list goes on.)

I never regretted for a second getting mine even though I paid close to
full price. I don't think it will ever be mainstream but for a true
techie its hard to beat.

With this group, that's close enough to on-topic. In fact, it's a lot
more on-topic than a lot of the stuff we get into!

Since you don't have any control over these machines, you have to decide
if you can trust that there is no keystroke grabbing program running. If
there is, then what you type will not be secure, even if you can arrange
a secure connection.

Hopefully others on the list will have more complete answers for you.

I think I read of an ssh client for java once.  If you could set up a
small webserver there (or somewhere else) maybe you could install this
java applet in a webpage and access the webpage from the cafe, allowing
you to ssh from the cafe to your linux boxen.  From there you could
start a VNC session on your boxen and open another window and do the VNC
thing via java, as well.  That would allow you to do your banking on
slightly more secure terms.  If you could come up with a way to forward
the VNC session through your java ssh connection, it would be a little
more secure.

That's what I'd look in to, anyway!  I don't remember where I read about
the java ssh client, or if it even *was* SSH, but I think it was.

Oops, I answered this part above.

Does lynx have https support?  I don't think it does, but I dunno. 
Maybe look in to links and elinks and see if they do (if lynx doesn't).

Good luck, be sure and share whatever works.  :-)

My biggest fear on public computers is that some bozo has installed a
keystroke logger.  These range from simple software programs to devilish
hardware jobbies that look like the old PS/2-to-DIN keyboard converters.

The only good workaround is to use one-time passwords for
everything.  Unfortunately, you can't do that for your bank passwords
since you don't control the login method there.

Basically, if you can't bring your own client (notebook, Palm w/TopGun
SSH, etc.) in and hook it to their network, don't enter any sensitive
data.

Or maybe I'm just paranoid.  ;-)

Is there any particular reason to use a FIFO over pipe?. The output 
coming from netstat can be piped through a variety of text utitiles to 
filter and/or reformat the data being collected.

I wonder if an automounter could be configured to perform automatic
mounts of the CDROM?  That's what I do on Linux.  I use "autofs":

    /etc/auto.master

# $Id: auto.master,v 1.2 1997/10/06 21:52:03 hpa Exp $
# Sample auto.master file

/mnt/nfs /etc/auto.nfs

    /etc/auto.rem

## icd		-fstype=iso9660,ro	:/dev/hdd
## sparq		-fstype=auto,nosuid,nodev,sync :/dev/hdc1
8<------------------------------------------------------------>8

... now all I do is put the CD in the drive and "cd /mnt/rem/cd".

Actually, Fry's had them for $313 last weekend. Maybe check there
(assuming you're in the Portland Metro Area).

Yep. The people giving it bad reviews (Gartner piled on today because
apparantly Pocket PC is better for enterprise apps and Sharp should just
put out a Pocket PC, according to them) aren't technical and thus don't
appreciate the upside to the Zaurus. And the upside is huge. Lineo did an
AWESOME job with the Kernel and TrollTech did a great job with Qtopia. The
Zaurus is VERY fast when stacked up against a Pocket PC and it does many
of the things a Linux desktop can.

Yep. I'm thinking of buying a second one while they're still cheap and
while the 5500 is still in production. Just seal it away for a rainy day.
I can't imagine using another palmtop.

AFAIK, they all do, but the presence of SSL support depends on compile
options and the presence of SSL libs on your system.

The easiest is if they just give you access to a desktop.  If that
happens, fire up IE, enter "www.google.com" and then "putty ssh
download" and then hit the "I feel lucky" button.  Download Putty (the
first link in the middle of the page) and save it to the desktop.
Double click, and you're on.  Be sure to select ssh not telnet.

If they give you a web browser and not a desktop, select the "run it"
rather than "save it" when it starts to download.  This is less likely
to work, but works more frequently than you might expect. :)

If that doesn't work, google for "authenticated mindterm", and run any
one of the dozen hits you find.... it'll fire up a Java ssh terminal
inside the browser window.  A few of the control keys won't work
(they'll be intercepted as browser controls), but the rest is fine.
(Forget emacs. :-)

I've found one of those three plans almost always works, unless it's a
really crappy internet cafe.

Make sure you're getting 128-bit SSL and not 40-bit SSL.  But SSL

Wow! You sure made that easy! Thanks!
I followed your instructions to www.chiark.greenend.org.uk, and found
putty.exe. I downloaded that and a few others. They all fit on a single
floppy. Can I just take a floppy (FAT32) with me in my pack, and stuff
that in the M$ box?

It looks like putty is exactly what I need for the ssh connection.

I think for the banking chores, I might use a trusted-friend's
windows-box. It's a scary world out there, and I'm not even sure what
konqerer is doing when I access the bank's site from home.

  What is the appropriate way(s) of specifying a blank subject line in an
incoming message?

  In /etc/postfix/header_checks, I had the line:
		/^Subject:   / 		REJECT <message>
but this does not detect and reject spam with no subjects.

  Someone on the mailhelp list suggested removing the blanks, but that just
rejects all my incoming mail. If I use ".*", there has to be zero or more
occurrences of any character after the word, Subject.

Thanks,

I was doing it that way and still have a floppy or three with PuTTY but 
then I purchased some of those credit card size CDROM's and burned onw 
with all PuTTY's friends and a few other files.  A little less suseptable 
to the X-ray machines and other cute security machines.  Looks extremely 
coll and high tech when you flip it out instead of a floppy disk.  Down 
side is there may not be a CDROM drive at some locations.

> It looks like putty is exactly what I need for the ssh connection.

I use it all the time from a couple of MS Windows machines taht I'm forced 
to use.

You might want to put it on CD as well, increase your chances of finding
something to stuff it in.  Putty doesn't require any registry settings,
so you will be able to run it right of the disk.

Subject: [PLUG] Samba connection problem - RH7.3 box to WinME
Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.0.20020729002834.00b6bfe0@pop.net-yan.com>

Hi All Guys,

I carried out experimenting a crossover connection between a WinME box and 
a RH7.3 Box.  The setting of WinME is without problem.  It can communicate 
with another WinME box or a WinXP box with crossover connection.

I have Samba running on a RH7.3 box

#service smb start/stop
Everything OK without complaint

Tried several times but unfortunately problem still remains 
unsolved.  Hereinunder is my test result, all carried out as root.


1) I used following simplified smb.conf

# Samba config file
# Global parameters

[global]
workgroup = SEC
netbios name = M20
server string = Samba Box
security = SHARE
log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
max log size = 50
socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192
printcap name = lpstat
dns proxy = No
printing = cups

[pub]
comment = Public_share
path = /path to share
read only = No
guest ok = Yes

(Remark.  SEC is my workgroup and M20 is the computer name of RH7.3 box)


2)
#service smb start

Everything OK without complaint


3)
WinME box could not find RH7.3 box
Mapping/search computer did not work


4) Carried out following tests

# hostname
localhost.localdomain

/etc/hosts
# Do not remove the following line, or various programs
# that require network functionality will fail.
127.0.0.1               localhost.localdomain localhost M20



/etc/sysconfig/network

NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain


/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
ONBOOT=yes


/etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-eth0.info

IPADDR=218.188.33.13
NETMASK=255.255.254.0
NETWORK=218.188.32.0
BROADCAST=218.188.33.255
GATEWAY=218.188.32.1
DNS=210.0.144.66,210.0.144.26
DHCPSID=192.168.252.202
DHCPGIADDR=218.188.32.1
DHCPSIADDR=192.168.252.202

DHCPSNAME=
LEASETIME=3600

REBINDTIME=3150
INTERFACE=eth0
CLASSID="Linux 2.4.18-3 i686"
CLIENTID=00:50:FC:39:3B:59


I think the problem may be coming from the ethernet card.  Because I have 
only one ethernet card in RH7.3 box for connecting to Internet.  I removed 
the broadband cable and plug in the crossover cable.  The WinME box has 2 
ethernet cards, one for connecting to Internet and another for Intranet.  I 
rebooted the RH7.3 box.  The eth0 could not detect the connection

Do I need to edit the ethernet card of RH7.3 box ???  If YES, then how ???

Thanks in advance.

Stephen

...if you can install software on their machines (will not be true at 
all cybercafes).

If you cannot install putty on a cybercafe machine, you might try the 
java applet someone else suggested. It's called mindterm. A google 
search should give you the URL. You do not need to get Java running on 
your linux box, you just need Java applets to be runnable from the 
Windows machine you're connecting from.

Actually, the /topic on the #orlug IRC channel says it all.

Someone typed 'halt' in the wrong term window while logged in remotely

And that was the charm. Hanging the Maxtor off the onboard controller
allowed the system to boot via grub from the HD. It fsck'd cleanly. I took
advantage of the down time to upgrade to RH7.3 - which also got me a kernel
with native support for the Promise controller. I adjusted grub.conf and the
swap entry in fstab, shutdown, hung the drive off the Promise controller,
crossed my fingers and rebooted into 2.4.18-3smp, et voila! 

Upgrading to 2.4.18-5 rpms was another story altogether (which, IIRC, has
already been told on the list). Bottom line, 20Mb isn't enough for /boot on
RH7.3.

The only other problem I had was when I fired up fetchmail to get my ~1Mb
worth of email from mail.aracnet.com. Spamassassin somehow got its knickers
in a twist and went spawn crazy. The load went up to around 90, and I
noticed lots of duplicate email was being created in my mail spool. I killed
fetchmail, commented spamassassin out of my .procmailrc, cleaned up the
dupes, and fired up fetchmail again. This time, no problems. I've since
reenabled spamassassin and haven't seen a repeat of the fiasco.

It's nice to be back :-) And tomorrow my mother-in-law goes home <big grin>.

Many thanks to _all_ the PLUGers who came to my aid. This list rocks!

Do you need new? Have you tried Wacky Willy's? They sometimes have 19"
racks.

Subject: [PLUG] Cursor Only?
Message-ID: <3D458984.93D781B5@attbi.com>

I'm running RH 7.1 on my Thinkpad 390X. I ran Webmin from the browser on
another machine and connected just fine. I logged out of Webmin. Then I
went to have a look at something by using the laptop's own keyboard and
screen, and I found that all I have is a cursor. (The power management
creen saver had kicked in so the screen was totally blank.) The cursor
moves around when I use the pointing post (that red button thingy in the
middle of the keyboard), but there is no other response to it. I tried
to telnet into it, but got an error message saying that the connection
could not be made. I decided to log back in with Webmin and found that I
didn't have to give a username and password. I looked around the system
with Webmin just to make sure that I was actually seeing something live. 

Is there a keyboard combination that I can use to put me in some mode
that will let me recover from this? This happened to me once before and
I simply shut down and restarted. I realize that's the wimpy way out,
and I'm trying to learn "the better way."

Thanks in advance.

(I tried sending this over the weekend, but of course it didn't get
through. The odd thing is that it didn't bounce as undeliverable.)

No. The ROM isn't backward compatible with the old Zaurus. All they have
in common is the name.The newer hardware really is worth the money. 200
Mhz StrongArm, 64MB memory, SD and CF slots, QWERTY keyboard (Blackberry
style) Nice 16 bit TFT screen. The one drawback is battery life. I get
about 6-8 hours of active use for it, but if you use it continuously (
like to listen to MP3s) you would want to get a second battery. Luckily,
you can plug the power cord directly to the unit as well as using the
cradle to charge. It only takes about 2 hours to fully recharge.

I have yet to learn a lot about mysql but I know that Oracle has what's
called rowid as a secret part of every row in each table. 

Can you do something like 

select rowid, name from sometable
where something = 'what you are looking for';

then 

delete from sometable
where rowid = '1239451234038';

For troubleshooting, try this: (Don't forget to change permissions
back
to something reasonable)

Create a /var/log/squidGuard/log directory if it doesn't exist.
Create an /etc/squidGuard directory if it doesn't exist.
symlink /etc/squidGuard/squidGuard.conf to the real file, if needed.
In squid, call squidGuard with the -c /etc/squidGuard/squidGuard.conf
option.
Change your permissions on /var/log/squidGuard to 777 recursively
(Change this
back when you are done troubleshooting)
Change your permissions on /usr/whatever/squidGuard-1.2 to 777
recursively (Change
this back when you are done)
Try starting squid, and view the squidGuard log files, both in
/var/log/squidGuard 
and /var/log/squidGuard/log
If this doesn't work, simplify your squidGuard.conf file as much as
possible until
it works, then add the rules back in.

You don't really indicate the setup here, but if the screen that you are
on is your X display, you could try the <ctl><alt><F1> combination to
switch you to a virtual console and fix the problem from there.  In some
cases, just switching to a virtual console and back to your X display will
clean-up/fix display and mouse problems.  If you are already on a virtual
console, the only thing I could suggest would be to try switching to a
different one using <alt><F2> (or F3, F4, ...).  An alternative for
getting out of X is to use a specially defined key sequence for
killing the X server (assuming it is configured).  I'm can't remember
what the current standard sequence is, but I think it is either:
<ctl><alt><backspace> or <ctl><alt><\> unfortunately, I'm having a fit of
senility and can't remember where/how this is configured.

It's a Red Hat 7.3 system. Is the module installed by
default (I didn't see a module that sounds familiar)
or do I have to recompile modules, or do I have
to download something from Logitech's site?

Hi Stephen,

You need to hard-set the IP addresses of both the winblowz box and the
Red Hat box.  They can't communicate if they are on separate subnets
(the reason the crossover works between winblowz boxes is that if they
can't find an address, they assign themselves an address that has
nothing to do with your network, but allows communication between them,
linux doesn't do this).

Good Luck

Try /usr/sbin/mouseconfig

and see if Logitech is one of the options.

If not you will be able to find the module on the RedHat CD.

You won't be using a module for this unless it's a usb mouse.. then it
will be the usb modules that will load and not a specific module for the
mouse alone. There is part of XFree86.

If it's ps/2 don't worry about the usb stuff if it's usb make sure that
usb-uhci is loaded before you plug in your mouse.

As root run `mouseconfig` and choose from the list. You will probably
need to ctl+alt+backspace to restart X after you've done this.

Lack of patience on my part. Shortly after I sent the second one, I
found both of them waiting in my in-box.

Sorry, and now I can't recall if I was logged in or not. However, I know
I was at least at the login screen provided by Gnome. I had been
switching between Gnome and KDE. Sometimes I was logged in as root, and
sometimes as a normal user. I don't generally leave the machine logged
in as root (general principles: avoiding a bad habit) so I'm pretty sure
that if I was logged in, it would have been as an ordinary user.

Thanks. That got me to a console screen and I was able to log in as
root. ps -ax didn't show any processes used by my ordinary user, so I'm
assuming that I wasn't logged in.

Now, what's the way to get back to X? I tried startx, but I got:

  Fatal server error:
  Server is already active for display 0
          If this server is no longer running, remove /tmp/.X0-lock
          and start again.

I probably shouldn't have done this next, but I tried removing
/tmp/.X0-lock and starting again and got:

  Fatal server error:
  Cannot establish any listening sockets - Make sure a X server isn't
already running

  Xlib: connection to "0.0" refused by server
  Xlib: Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key
  giving up
  xinit:  unable to connect to X server
  xinit:  No such process (errno 3):  Server error.

>From this I assume that X is running. ps -ax | grep X returns 9 lines
with -DHAVE_PROXY plus one line with:

  1882 ?     S     0:02 /etc/X11/X vt7 -auth /var/lib/gdm/:0.Xauth :0

I killed 1882. The screen cleared, and I got a console login prompt. I
logged in as root, again, and ran startx. I now have the X cursor on a
cross-hatched background, but nothing else.

I tried <ctrl><alt><F1> and found some lines referencing NEOMAGIC,
mostly saing that it was "Not programming shadow registers."
 
I tried <ctrl><alt><F2> and found a login prompt. 

<ctrl><alt><F3> puts me in the console where I killed 1882.

<ctrl><alt><F4> is another login prompt, as are <ctrl><alt><F5>, and
<ctrl><alt><F6>.

<ctrl><alt><F7> is the cross-hatched background with the X cursor. 

<ctrl><alt><F8> is a blank screen with a blinking underscore cursor as
are <ctrl><alt><F9>, <ctrl><alt><F10>, <ctrl><alt><F11>, and
<ctrl><alt><F12>.

Message-ID: <1027976013.6726.17.camel@laptop>

Now that this list is being moderated would it not be a good idea to let
relevant posts through to the list even if the are posted from a
non-subscribed email address. I would think denying only truly off topic
emails and spam would be desirable. That's pretty much the theory of
moderation correct. Especially a list that is for the passing of
information on to other individuals in the community. 

You now automatically get a response saying that you sent the message
from a non-subscribed email. That's either going to remind you to double
check next time or make sure to subscribe with that address.. It should
not automatically mark the post for non-inclusion to the list unless
it's as described above. Also, if you are _replying_ directly to a
previous post to the list you're probably subscribed to it anyway and
not just trying to post a first of thread message to the list.

I make this note because a post to the list was denied today even though
the post was relevant, a thorough answer and mistakenly sent from
another email address which is not what I am subscribed as.

A-

 And yes I reposted it from the subscribed email but that's not my
point.

It isn't.  The moderation comes ONLY if you post from a non-subscribed 
address.

As I'm the one who's been checking the administrative page lately, it 
falls to me to decide if/when email makes it through to the list.

It is by no means an 'automatic' thing.  Each and every email that comes 
through and is NOT from a subscribed address, I will see.  Every spam, 
every legitimate email, everything.  For about 2 weeks after I made the 
change to the list to make it subscriber-only, I let email go through 
that was relevant from non-subscribers.  I added people to the whitelist 
who had an alternate address, or who posted from the newsgroup.  I 
posted a message to the list REQUESTING this information from people who 
wanted to post from multiple addresses, and gave instructions for those 
who would have liked to do it themselves.

I've done more than my fair share.  If there was an option to BOTH admit 
the message AND send and email back to the sender reminding them to post 
from a subscribed address, I'd do that.  However, I'd much rather have 
people get into the habit of posting from a subscribed address.  After 
all, it's only your FROM: header that has to include the correct 
address.  I don't believe it actually checks if you're posting from 
foo.org when your email address looks like user at foo.org.

I check the administrative pages at least once a day during the week. 
Usually there are 1 or 2 messages in there a day.  Most of the time 
they're spam, or someone who has munged their address for newsgroup 
posting - but not posting from the news gateway.  Spam gets denied, 
other relevant email I will usually reject with a more informative 
message explaining WHY the message was rejected and what you can do to 
avoid this in the future.

Is the "LIMIT" qualifier what you're looking for?
e.g.

  DELETE FROM table WHERE (condition) LIMIT n;

So if you have 8 duplicate entries, then you use n=7.

Richard,

Yep. I personally appreciate all the time you've spent making the list 
a going concern -- and I'm sure many others do too.

Right. I regularly (mostly, in fact) post from work, but have the From
header set to my subscribed (home) address. I'd be happy to provide
instructions about how to set the From header in pine, and I'm sure it
wouldn't be hard for others to provide similar instructions for other
mail clients.

Subject: [PLUG] Typiing in a replacement bullet character to open office
Message-ID: <1027978125.481.298.camel@kat.zotnet.com>

So I have found a bug in open office.

The bullet character as used by windows (Symbol Font, 0xF0B7  ).  When I
print with these bullets, its fubars ghostscript.  If I replace the
image used for the font (say OpenSymbol, 0xE01E, the standard Open
Office bullet).

So I would love to fix the bullet crashing ghostscript issues (which was
determined by printing to file, then using gv to review it), but in the
mean time I have a 200 page document to print.

The document uses bullets through out, in tables, and other nonsense
things.

So I would like to replace all the instances of 0xF0B7 with a better
one. I have been trying to replace it in Start Office, but 200 pages is
al ot.  I cannot seem to replace the image with find and replace.

I tried hand editing the files in the zip of the sxw, but that did not
work very well.

Finally in the name of speed I renamed the Symbol font in OpenOffice
(/usr/local/OpenOffice.org1.0/share/psprint/fontmetric/Symbol.afm) and
it now works, but I am not sure if I am messing things up elsewhere.

I could for a small document goto Stylist->list styles and modify the
list styles, but the 200 page document has something like 200 "list
styles."  (one for each bulleted set of items I think).

Any ideas?

  If you have the postscript file, have you tried loading it in emacs or joe
and doing a search-and-replace there? Or, within OO, can't it be replaced
with a different bullet character?

  I find that a lot of winWord characters do not translate into OO very
well. I don't know if this is a function of the default typeface I use
(Bitstream Amerigo) or independent of typeface.

  The related problem to this is that the OO issuezilla web site (silly
name, I know) is crippled. It won't let me attach a file to the issue
because it won'e accept my login. That's another issue they're working on.

I have no problem with mail only from subscribed address.   Is this

been deleting most lug mail from lots of lugs.

If indeed this is a moderated list I will unsub.  Of course no one will
mind if I am the one the moderation was set for.

It was me, and I'm sorry about the list being down over the weekend.
I was up too late working...  I had a user mode linux in one terminal
and a login as root to drizzle in another.  I use a function bound on
a key in Sawfish that swaps the last two windows I've visited, so I
can flick back and forth between my editor and a terminal.  I went
from the editor to the terminal to halt the user mode linux session,
and was apparently in the wrong terminal.

Sorry for top-posting, I'm not in a trimming mood.  :-)

My guess is you just need to kill X and go from there.

ps ax | grep X
should give you a pid to kill... or just do a..

killall X

or maybe...

killall gdm

To kill the gnome login manager thing.  As root, just run gdm again and
it should bring back your graphical login.

You could also go into a single user mode (telinit 1) and go back to
where you were (runlevel 4?  telinit 4) and all should be good.

Don't forget to log out of your console after you have things back up
and running.  :-)

HTH,

Rob

I appologize if these are redundant tips, but there are easier ways to
navigate the virtual terminals (VT) in linux.

At the command line you need only press <alt>, <ctrl> is only needed in X.
The next thing to notice is that if you are going to look at all the VTs
then you can hold down the alt key and use one of the left or right arrow
keys.  It works pretty well to scan through the VTs.  Try it sometime
during a distro install.  Many distros will let you cycle through the VTs
or if it is a graphical install sometimes you can hit <ctrl><alt> and one
of the F keys to find a terminal.  I have used it before to do lots of
handy things during an install.  Or just to learn about the installation
process.

BTW, if you use the <alt>arrowkey trick eventually it will put you back in
X if it is running.  So I usually do like <alt>F1 then use the arrow key
trick.

Well random tips...I hope you find them useful.

Hello Matt,

To follow up on my last message .. No .. probably the easiest way to
do this would be to create a new table with the same structure as you
currently have and create an index which is built of multiple columns
which when put together will define your 'unique' information.

Here is a little example from the DOC for mysql

CREATE TABLE test (
           id INT NOT NULL,
           last_name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
           first_name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
           PRIMARY KEY (id),
           INDEX name (last_name,first_name));


Then if you insert into your new table from your old table .. all rows
which do not maintain uniqueness will create and error.  Your new
table will have only unique rows.  Then use this new table so any
newly inserted or updated data will follow the rules.

Hope this helps

No, it's not a moderated list.

The list was moved from an 'open' list (any message sent to the list 
address from ANY address would get through) to a 'subscribe-only' list 
(only subscribers can post) because we were getting quite a bit of spam. 
  South African money laundering scheme, Viagra ads, standard Porn spam, 
etc.  There was quite a hubub about it, and at the time the list admin 
was too busy to take care of it and/or research what was needed to get 
it done.  A couple of us in the #orlug irc channel (on 
irc.openprojects.net) figured out what was needed and I made a request 
to the list admin to help with the job.

So we changed the list to a subscribe-only list.  There was no one 
person who caused the change, and no legitimate posts were the catalyst. 
  In the end, it was a particulary graphic sex advert that caused the 
biggest uproar (and no, I don't have a copy ;).

The only time any moderation is necessary is when someone posts from a 
non-subscribed address.  Since your message made it through without any 
user intervention, you are just fine.

When I typed killall X I got a response that insisted that X was not
running. When I typed killall gdm, gdm started! It's not exactly what
you said would happen, but it served the purpose. Thanks.

One of the things most of you probably do in your sleep is to switch
between virtual consoles. I was sort of aware of the ability to do this,
but never had a need (before now). As a result, I didn't know that X was
running in console 7, so I didn't know that to switch back to X after
switching to one of the other virtual consoles I would simply type
<ctrl><alt><F7>

Cool. I just tried that. <ctrl><alt><F1> followed by six <alt> right
arrows put me back in X.

This is one of those learning experiences that wasn't covered in the
books I read. Or if it was, it was mentioned once but never used, so it
didn't sink in. Nothing like practical applications to drive home a
concept.

Thanks again.

Sometimes, if X is working but just messed up, all you have to do is
switch back to the X screen once you have switched so a virtual console,
and everthing will be fine.  This should be the screen you got below:

[snip]
>
> <ctrl><alt><F7> is the cross-hatched background with the X cursor.
[snip]

If what you got here was not what you normally expect to see for your X
display, and if moving the mouse around or hitting a key (preferably with
a sledge hammer :-) didn't give you the display you expect (in case this
is a screen saver you are looking at).  Then X is presumably hosed, and
you should switch back to one of your virtual consoles <ctrl><alt><F1> (or
F2 - F6), and restart X.  I'm not sure what brand of Linux you are using
or which program you are using for the X login screen, but something like
one of the following might work (run as root):

    /etc/init.d/xdm restart
or
    /etc/init.d/gdm restart
or
    /etc/init.d/kdm restart

These are the most common X login managers, but the locations of these
scripts and the "restart" option may be different on your system, this is
Debian style, and I don't know/remember where/how most other distributions
do this.  If it is majorly hosed, you may need to manually kill it and
then use the "start" option with one of the above scripts.

I was always told you weren't considered a real sysadmin until you done a
rm -rf at root.

   I am a glad someone found one of the alternative 'real sysadmin' tests
I invented.  Pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del while viewing one terminal and using
the other keyboard is another one.

It could have been worse.  I've seen several databases destroyed because
someone removed/overwrote the one on the "wrong" system.  At least a
"halt" is 100% recoverable.

PS: Yes, one of those databases was me.  ;-)  I figured out how to embed
the hostname in the XTerm title bar very shortly thereafter...

Hi All,

Over the weekend, we had the opportunity to have our servers thoroughly 
pounded (rumor is almost 1/4 million users in less than an hour). 
Needless to say we had a hard time keeping things going (though they did
keep going).

Questions that arise after the fact:

Is there a limit to the number of connections a Cisco router can deal
with (even if the pipe is not full of packets)?  I'm wondering if some
of the problems we had were upstream.

What exactly happens when the syslog says "TCP: drop open request from
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xxxxx"?  Is this a connection that timed out (hung in
there for the 30 secs that apache gives it), or was it dropped as soon
as it was connected (there was a one minute period where I had close to
1000 of these)?

I've been running servers for a while, but this is the first chance I've
had to see such a thorough beating.

TIA

Derek Loree

Subject: [PLUG] system hangs with two DFE-580TX cards
Message-ID: <3D45D558.4030905@wselectric.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to build a Linux system with two DFE-580TX cards in it 
(D-Link 4-Port ethernet cards).  I'm using version 1.09 of the 
"sundance.o" driver, which seems to detect both cards properly.  I can 
bring up interfaces on either card, and as long as I only use interfaces 
on one card, things seem to work ok.  If I try to use interfaces on both 
cards, the system hangs completely -- no errors, no kernel panic.

The system assigns 4 different IRQ's to the cards, one to each port. 
 Then it assigns the same 4 IRQ's to the other card.  I have forced the 
system to use 1 IRQ for each card, but that doesn't help.  I also tried 
1 IRQ for all ports on both cards.

I've tried moving cards around, changing out memory, compiling the 
kernel with debugging support, but nothing seems to help.

Any ideas?

My personal favorite is:

rm -rf / home/user-you-meant-to-remove

Whoops!  Damn that sticky space bar!  ;-)

mine was

to backup /dev/hdb ... woops (removable packs and the tape on the other
machine ).

Anybody remember the "purge" option on the RSX-11 pip command?
I used it to neatly remove every file on disk right BETWEEN
the time that we did a major database update and the associated
backup.

Interestingly, I sat there for 10 minutes ignoring the repeated
complaints of a visitor from our New York office that "something
was wrong", because I had already decided that the guy never
knew what he was talking about.

Hmmm... Let's see... Is telling this story a good career move :-)

  Also indidious was the one I did because my fingers were too fast on the
[Enter] key:
  rm .* (from ~/)
when I intended to type
  rm .*~

  Have you memorized all the dot files in your home directory?

  A quick trip for the last weekly (full) backup tape bailed me out.

I'll let some of the Cisco experts comment, but the short answer is yes.

This is a result of the TCP syn cookies code kicking in and dropping TCP
connections.  Look at tcp_ipv4.c for details.  ;-)

edit /etc/X11/XF86Config-4.
change "ps/2"  to  "imps/2".

Restart your X Server.  That is all.

Now you can scroll vertically but not horizontally.  Horizontal scrolling 
will be another story.  I am still looking for a solution of the latter.

Speaking of that...

I haven't looked into it yet (so forgive me if it's really obvious) but I'm
wondering about dealing with multiple From headers with a single email
account that has many aliases.

(Just ditched my old ISP and finally set up my own email server, and am
using a different alias for pretty much everything I'm subscribed to.)

I'm using mutt most of the time, but sometimes evolution from another box. 
I'm also planning on trying out squirrelmail.

I guess my question is: Can any of these clients intelligently fill in the
From: header for replies and forwards based on the alias it came in on? 
Without manually typing it out each time to override the one in a config
file?

Jeremy

(I'm sure I missed a post or two while switching subscriptions, too.)

Hi Derek,

Thanks for your advice.

Kindly advise how to hand-set the IP addresses on RH7.3 box.

Thanks in advance.

I hardly ever use `rm' by itself as myself and *never* as root.

I usually perform the following:

find /the/directory/or/files/you/wish/to/delete -exec ok {} \;

In scripts, I always check first to see if the directory exists:

  if [[ -d /full/path/to/directory ]]
  then
    find /full/path/to/directory -exec rm {} \;
  fi

Of course, if you enjoy sleeping in your office, be my guest.

You'll need to do this again (to go back to DCHP) once you plug back 
into your cable modem.

Similar:

/bin/rm: .o: no such file

:-)

Personally, I've

* reset the values in an entire database when I did an UPDATE without 
  a WHERE clause (backups can be sooooo handy :-)

* rebooted our console server by issuing a shutdown command in a local 
  xterm instead of a remote console session

* killed our NT server and all HP printers by port-scanning the

Hi Dan,

Thanks for your advise.

In RH7.3 box
When connecting to broadband I am compelled using dynamic IP address

Shall I set the IP address of the LAN card as 172.34.34.38 ???

In WinME box
There are 2 LAN cards, one for connection to Internet via broadband and 
another for Intranet

Shall I set IP address of the LAN card for Intranet as 17.34.34.38

Thanks in advance.

Stephen

The list isn't moderated.

If someone is infected with an Outlook virus who is also subscribed to the list, chances are we'll get spammed by it.  Karl is working on getting spamassassin or some other spam-filtering agent working with the list...or he could tap me if he needs to.  I'm just as crazed about spam as the next guy.  ;)

What makes this most recent piece of spam interesting is the fact that
the author,

That's like the time I had VMware full screen, and it rebooted into
it's bios screens.  I thought my workstation had rebooted
spontaneously.

The other one I did was on Andy Fraser's Student's lab computer at
PSU...  I was doing some housekeeping, using "dired" in XEmacs, and
goofed...  I meant to "chown newuser:newgroup -R *".  Recall that in
"dired", the "*" means the selected set of files and directories.  But
instead, I typed "chown newuser:newgroup -R .", from "/".

It's that "I just saw my dog get run over" feeling!

Luckily, I had a second computer running the similar release of
Debian.  I wrote a "find" command that used it's printf and %
expansions to make a "|" separated file with the owner and permission
settings.  I then wrote a shell script that used "eval $(awk ...)" to
set some shell variables holding the value of each field for each line
of the file, and set the ones on the blown computer to the ones on the
reference machine, ignoring files that exist on one but not the other.

Yeah, DHCP seems to be the norm w/ broadband services these days. FWIW,
many of these places use long lease times on the DHCP leases, effectively
giving you a static IP w/o the administrative headache for them. I use
attbi and have 92:50:54 left on my currernt lease as I write this. None of
this has much to do with what you are asking. Sorry...

> Shall I set the IP address of the LAN card as 172.34.34.38 ???

You probably want to pick a pair of private IP addresses (i.e. not routed
by core Internet routers) for the interfaces. These ought to work:

192.168.0.1  <-- Samba box
192.168.0.2  <-- Intranet interface on WinME box

Here are the ranges for the other private networks:

-----------------------------------------------------------
|         RESERVED PRIVATE NETWORK ALLOCATIONS            |
-----------------------------------------------------------
| Network | Netmask       | Network Addresses             |
| Class   |               |                               |
-----------------------------------------------------------
|    A    | 255.0.0.0     | 10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255  |
|    B    | 255.255.0.0   | 172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255  |
|    C    | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 |

Sounds like you might benefit from having a router/firewall, if you want
to keep a home network setup more permenantly. Folks on this list might be
able to give more information if you're looking to roll-your-own solution
via floppyfw or somesuch. Several vendors (SMC, Linksys, D-link, etc.)
make these if you want to buy-and-play. Cheap too; I found a D-link for
$48 at newegg.com.

Egads!  Well, I didn't approve that message, for sure.

The test post from AJ from a non-susbscribed address I just rejected as 
well, so the mechanism still works.  Perhaps someone found a bug in mailman?

Yes, you are right.  This is my first experiment on networking in Linux 
world.  My next one will be VNC.  I already have in mind to get a new 
router/switch hub for sometimes to carry out further experiment but still 
do not figure out whether to go wireless or cable.

Anyway, lot of thanks for your further advice.  I shall come back after test

I brought down the servers in our building at a certain large chip

their fingers at me the next day.  ;)

I went home, blissfully unawares.  Funny thing was that the guy who

paged for THIS ISSUE while we were standing right next to him.  Mwahahaha.

Isn't there a way to use the microsoft truetype fonts?  But then you'd
have to get them into ghostscript somehow...

Does your postscript printer take the file, even though gs crashes on it?

Is it the latest version of gs?

Does it outright crash, or just give errors about not finding that
symbol or something?

I'm no email header guru... so the info might still be there... but the
actual email address of the sender is in the original (non-messed up by
the list) headers.  Not as FROM, but is reply to or something similar. 
The List software probably caught that (from a subscribed individual)
and allows the posting.

Klez forges the FROM header.

If any of you out there are irresponsible enough to be running Outlook
Express and have it set up so it (by default) automatically executes
email content without an *updated* Antivirus program set to
automatically scan your email... I should hope to hell you have fixed
the problem.  Both by securing Outlook Express (set it to restricted
under SECURITY or format c:) and actually removing the Klez infection
(which will continue to send emails out, forged as they are, without OE
being vulnerable).

Just glancing at the headers, I think the offending member is on ATT
Broadband.

I might expect something like this on a list of generic people with
Internet access... but the *Linux* list... geeze.  Sorry, I've been
rude... but I'm just totally appalled that anybody here would be
downright dumb enough to infect themselves with klez (or to not educate
other users of the computer about the dangers of executables).

Sheesh.

Yeah, my friend and I were having a coding session and he meant to get rid
of the ~ files too...same thing.  We had just completely rewritten the

Hi Dan,

Further to my email of today.  I performed following procedure according to 
you advice.  Unfortunately I still failed

(Simplified smb.conf)

--------------- Start -------------------

# Samba config file
# Global parameters

[global
workgroup = SEC
netbios name = M20
server string = Samba Box
security = SHARE
log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
max log size = 50

printcap name = lpstat
dns proxy = No
printing = cups

[pub]
comment = Public_share
path = /path to share
read only = No
guest ok = Yes

------------- End -------------

(REMARK: Also performed another test by replacing [pub] with [tmp] )
[tmp]
comment = Temporary file space
path = /tmp
writable = yes
read only = no
public = yes

wins support = yes


On WinME box
===========
Add static IP   192.168.0.2
Netmask   255.255.255.0

Restarted WinME


On RH7.3 box
==========

edit   /usr/sbin/netconfig
Add    IP address   192.168.0.1

followings were automatically added by hitting TAB key
Netmask   255.255.255.0
Default gateway (IP)   192.168.254
Prmiary nameserver    192.168.0.1

OK

Relogin (also tried   "Reboot")

then
#service smb start
Both SMB and NMB started without complaint

Good Morning all,

I am trying to find out how I can go about servicing a domain from behind
a firewall.  That is I have an exposed IP on the firewall that is a RH 7.3
box and it resolves one domain.  Now there is a need to resolve another
domain and that computer that will do all that work is on the internal
network.  How do I forward all request from the firewall box to the
internal network computer such that all services are answered by the
internal computer?  I will need http,ftp,ssh,pop,smtp and possibly more
forwarded to the internal computer.
I know that I can use apache to proxy the request but I don't know how to
handle the other protocols and thought that there must be a way to do
this.  I will have the second domain being resolved the the firewalls IP. 
I have thought that a DNS server on the firewall would help but it will
just tell all the request that the IP is (10.0.0.13) and that will not
work for the world.  So, do I need some proxy server?  is it built into
iptables some how?
Thanks for the help.

Josh

You shouldn't need a proxy server; iptables will do the trick for you.  
For the sake of this example, assume that

* eth0 is your external interface; its address is 123.45.67.89
* eth1 faces your LAN
* the internal host that will be serving these requests is 10.0.0.13

1. Make sure that your exposed host is setup for ip forwarding:

   sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

2. Add some prerouting entries to your nat table for common services 
   like http, ftp, etc. Also add explicit support for these ports in 
   your FORWARD table.

   for port in 80 21 22 25 110
   do
     iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport $port \
              -j DNAT --to 10.0.0.13:$port
     iptables -t filter -A FORWARD -i eth0 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.13 \
              --dport $port -j ACCEPT
   done

3. Make sure that traffic sent from 10.0.0.13 out to the internet gets 
   the NAT treatment.

   iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j SNAT --to 123.45.67.89

There's lots more to know about iptables than that -- but I just 
wanted to let you know that you can accomplish your packet passing 
with iptables.

Paul,

That sounds good but won't all traffic then to the 123.45.67.89 ip then
get forwarded to the internal machine?  I have two domains and would like
one resolved on 123.45.67.89 and the other sent to 10.0.0.13.
That is:

domain1.com  is seen from the world to go to 123.45.67.89 and that linux
box will handle all the request for any services.  This machine is also
the firewall and does NAT for the internal network.
domain2.com is also been seen to the world as being 123.45.67.89 but any
request to this domain should be forwarded to 10.0.0.13.
Is that still possible with iptables?  I have used iptables to forward
ports to a machine inside the firewall but all request go to that machine.
 I'm looking to have http://www.domain1.com get resolved on one server and
http://www.domain2.com get resolved on another server.  This would then be
extended beyong the http port and to all port traffic to each domain.

Yes, anyone who runs Outlook or Outlook Express should do a few things:

1. Turn off "preview" which shows opens the email down below when you 
single click on it. It should require a concious effort (double-click) to 
open an email and execute the code therein.

2. Run a virus checker and set it to download and install the latest 
virus definations regularly (at least twice a week).

3. Virus checker should also be set (as you mentioned) to scan each email. 
It will scan each *outgoing* email as well, protecting your friends.

3. Use a free operating system and email client -- though we should not 
get careless either. :-)

No.

In fact, it's pretty much impossible with any IP traffic except for
web stuff. HTTP 1.1 specifies that a hostname is to be passed to the
server (making name-based virtual servers possible) in the http
headers, but otherwise TCP/UDP traffic show up at a given IP address
without any care for the name that got them there.

For example, if 123.45.67.89, host.example.com, and cname.example.com 
all point to the same box, then the packets from these commands will 
all look identical when they reach the server:

  ftp 123.45.67.89
  ftp host.example.com
  ftp cname.example.com

AFAIK, there's absolutely no way to distinguish between them.

Unless I'm missing something, the only way to accomplish your goal is 
to get another real-world IP address and point your second domain name 
at it.

I think you understand and that was my concern.  I could combine the
servers for http and mail I suppose but was avoiding that.  I'll look into
getting another IP but that may be too expensive.  Thanks for the help.

That should be a safe thing to do, and even more so after I get
"amavis-exim", "scannerdaemon" (openantivirus.org) and "spamassassin"
all working on the PLUG mail server.

I have them installed, but the provided Exim setup instructions did
not work!  They contain a syntax error.  I got sleepy and gave up for
the night; today I will try again.

I will have it scan incoming mail only, so every post to the list
should get scanned before it get's forwarded.  I also ought to make it
send potential spam and viruses to the list admin.  I do not know how
to make it do that.  Anyone have a quick recipe?

Is that "internal network" a DMZ, or is it your private LAN?  You
should not run services inside your private LAN, since if the machine
is ever broken into, they'll have access to your LAN.  A DMZ (for
demilitarized zone) network is used for this purpose.  Machines on the
DMZ are isolated from both the Internet and from your internal private
LAN.

Two possible solutions here...  You could install a commercial
firewall product.  You might like the Netule FW-I at www.netule.com,
for instance.  Another option is to install "fwbuilder", and use it to
create your iptables script.  Either solution is much easier than hand
editting a firewall script.

You see?  It was in your sendmail queue all weekend!  You should be
able to discover when there is mail in your outgoing queue by using
the "mailq" command.  (works with sendmail and exim; not sure about
others) There is also a "runq" command that will ask it to run the
outgoing queue right now.

For the Debian newbies out there... (complaints from others to
/dev/null please) the equivalent is to either edit
"/etc/network/interfaces" -- RTFM "interfaces" and "ifup"; it's a very
simple and easy to learn syntax -- or to install "etherconf" and then
run "dpkg-reconfigure -plow etherconf" (the standard dpkg-reconfigure
recipe we all know and love) when you need to make changes.  If you
have the "configlets" installed, there's one for etherconf that will
show up in the Gnome control panel under the "Debian" heading.

I'm using Netscape as an e-mail client. The mail left my machine and
went to where ever attbi keeps things I send until they can be
delivered, or further up the chain towards the plug e-mail service. In
my case, sendmail isn't involved at my end.

For USB anything, I recommend installing the "hotplug" package, and
making sure your 2.4 kernel is built with hotplug support.  With that
running, anytime you jack in a USB device, the module is loaded for
you automaticly.  It also works with PCMCIA cards (I think) and stuff
like the "tun" module.  "tunctl -u karlheg" causes "hotplug" to run
"ifup tap0", for instance.

FWIW, you can use the same firewall computer to handle multiple IP
addresses, so you don't need additional hardware, only an additional IP
address.

Maybe I missed it, but what was the reason you didn't want to serve
both domains from the same computer?

"Josh Orchard" <josh at emediatedesigns.com>:
> I will need http,ftp,ssh,pop,smtp and possibly more

the simplest solution is to get a second IP address.  it's
way way simpler than anything else.  that aside...

http: the domain the client is trying to talk to is sent in
the http request, so that can be handled with standard tools.

everything else...

non-anonymous ftp, ssh, pop: they all have usernames sent as
part of the protocol, so if you don't have any usernames
that clash in the two domains, you can put up proxies that
redirect based on user name.  of course, anonymous ftp and
smtp and other things can't be handled that way.

if domain1 or domain2 is used mainly from particular places,
you could do iptables routing by source address.  A request
to 123.45.67.89 from network A goes to host X, a request
from network B goes to host Y, etc.

if you can't make that distinction, you can have iptables do
random routing, which is usually for load-balancing
purposes, but in this case the effect will be that half the
time connections will go to the right place.  This is likely
to be annoying to users.

if the user base is small enough, you can tell them to use
non-standard ports to access services on the other domain.
so a connection to port 22 (ssh) will go to domain1, but a
connection to port 10022 will go to domain2, etc.

if you have control over the DNS servers for the domain, you
can try playing clever games with guessing that when a DNS
request for domain1 is shortly followed by a connection
request from sort of the same direction on the network, then
it should go to host X instead of host Y.  This is a bizarre
solution that appeals to my "oooh, neat" instinct, but it's
much more effort than it's worth.

oh, also keep in mind that externally accessible computers
should probably be isolated from your internal computers by
a firewall.  to serve two domains, I'd want a configuration
something like this:

                        |---> domain1 server
                        |
   outside <--> router -|---> domain2 server
   world                |
                        |---> firewall/nat <---> internal net

router/firewall/nat can be the same physical box.

and tell users who ssh into the external servers that they
shouldn't trust the servers to be secure.  if you do need to
provide a trustworthy server for users to login to, that's
another problem.

all this wouldn't be such a big deal if every programmer
involved had an infallible understanding of security and
complexity issues.  I expect that to happen sometime in Q4
2002, so you might just want to wait until then.

Message-ID: <17FF88BF769F7A4E8215C133B216AB8676F37A@csmail1.tri-met.org>

I read here on the list a few weeks ago that ATTBI.com was doubling their
upload speed to a blazing 256k. My upload speed was always pitiful, so I
decided to test it. I went to a number of speed test sites and they all gave
me pretty much the same numbers 700k - 800k down and 2k upload. That is 2k,
like a 2400 baud modem. I tried rebooting the modem. Pulling the plug
overnight. No change.
Yesterday I got my letter from AT&T saying that MY broadband upload speed
had also been "doubled". I called and eventually got to a real person who
ran through her script asking me if I would clean out my history and cache. 
I pretended along with her, "What problem are you having with Outlook
Express"? I suppressed a giggle and continued to explain that my problem was
UPLOAD speed. I was the first person to ever complain to her about that.
 After a ten minute volley and numerous offline consultations, a tech
telneted into my cable modem and "fixed" the speeds. She had me pull the
plug on my cable modem and "hold it in my hand" for 45 seconds. I did so and
now I have 256k up and 1500k down.

The only reason I don't want to service both domains from the same
computer is because the other server already has all the items configured
and was asked to but it on the network.  I thought if I could just forward
the request to that machine then life would be easier then opening up the
first server to another person.
It appears that I will need another IP and then just forward all request
for that IP to the back machine.

Felix that was funny.  I guess I could spend the time and make some random
DNS entries(yes I have control) and have fun with that for a few days. 
But since all the security problems will be solve in Q4 2002 I'll just
look at a second IP and let them SSH in.  I do have one box with
firewall/router/NAT currently.  There would be a second box for the
domain2.com.  I'm cheap so domain1.com is on the router.  I know that is
bad, or so I'm told, but then again after Dec. I'll be fine.  The world
will be safe.  Mostly b/c all the telcos are going bankrupt and we won't
have IP traffic anymore.

Josh,

Isn't this one of those basic virtual domain situations?  I mean can't you
let Apache and Postfix handle this all from one IP?

That's how I do it,  but perhaps I've missed your specific criteria that
precludes this approach?

If I am understanding this correctly, there might be another alternative.
If you are just trying to allow your current Firewall/DNS server to act as
a server for another domain without allowing another person to access it,
you could simply setup your current DNS server as a secondary for the
internal computer, it would then get all DNS information for the new
domain from the internal system (while retaining control over it's
current domain), and could then present it to the internet.  Then you
would just register your current Firewall/DNS as the primary for the new
domain, even though from an internal perspective it is actually a
secondary.

Did I write this in a confusing enough manner, or should I try again :-)

I knew it, I just fsck'n /knew/ it *sigh*. I'm jacked in from work
yesterday and around 6:05pm I'm composing email to plug when there's no
keyboard response. I can't reach herring.org via a browser, but can reach
other sites - so it's not a connectivity issue at work. I call home and the
phone is RNA - meaning my wife isn't home and the answering machine isn't
working. Power fail, again!

At least this time the server rebooted and recovered when the power was
finally restored. Prior to the upgrade from RH7.2->7.3, everything except /
and /boot was ext3. I converted them to ext3 also when I upgraded.... glad I
did.

So, *reaches into ROUND2IT bin*, I just...

[root at kippered i386]# rpm - Uvh powerd-2.0.2-1.i386.rpm
Preparing...                ########################################### [100%]
   1:powerd                 ########################################### [100%]

...and ordered the serial interface cable from Insight (part# 940-0020,
$24.99 as opposed to $39.00 from APC, if you're interested). It'll be here
Thursday.

After last night's outage I called PGE and the rep promised to call me back
today with an explanation of the problem (main fuse failure / bad xformer).
I saw the dreaded PGE trucks on Barrows Rd. (Tigard) again this morning as I
left work. Thursday can't come soon enough for me!

What Klez does with mail headers is beside the point. Mailman uses the
From: field to identify the sender, and it preserves the From: field
when it posts the message to the list.

So the From: field in the spam must have been set to the eldragon
address when Mailman received it. The question is, since eldragon is
not subscribed, how did the message get posted to the list?

Probably the message was flagged for moderation, and a list
administrator approved it by mistake.

Jeff,

I don't really know which services they want to make available that are
already on the box.  I know that they have apache and sendmail running. 
They for sure will want ftp to remote update files.  And since they are
savvy a bit they will want ssh I think also.
I know with apache I could just put proxy and reverseproxy entries and get
that to work.  I don't know how I'd do that with postfix but I'm sure
there is a way.  As for ssh that I would have to open another port which I
suppose isnt' too bad and for ftp the same.
So, maybe I could do it.  Just remember that the second domain is
physically on another box and will want to remain there.  That is the key.
 Or at least I think so.
Josh

ok.  I think I'm still a bit confused here.  Are you suggesting that I
could use a primary and secondary DNS with one IP for two domains and have
all traffic somehow moved to the internal 10.0.0.13 box?  It seems like
that I will still need a secondary IP for the other domain and if I do
that I should just use iptables to forward all traffic on that IP to the
second box.  Am I wrong?

Good work!  It's pretty clever of ol' AT&T to advertise this as a
justification for cranking up our rates.  (Don't even get me started on
how I bought their $200 cable modem planning to recoup my costs as I saved
$10/month + $60 off on install.  No, it has not been 14 months yet.)

It's also especially clever that they advertise the speed increase, but
don't actually deliver until someone both notices and calls in.  I bet
that will only be maybe 5% of their customers.

Which sites do you think actually measure upload speed decently?

You can measure it yourself by running something like "gkrellm".

Actually I was suggesting that the external box could handle the DNS
traffic for both domains, but the configuration for one of them could be
maintained on the internal box.

No, you can only have one instance of a domain name server running on the
standard port, and you can't use iptables to selectively forward requests
depending on which domain it is for (well theoretically you probably
could by analyzing the packet content, but it definitely wouldn't be worth
the effort to configure).  What you would be doing is running a single
instance of your name server on the external box, which would be
configured to handle DNS services for multiple domains, getting DNS
information for one domain from it's local config files, and the DNS
information for the other domain from your internal server.  It would then
serve as the primary DNS server on the internet for both domains.

The key here is that while you must have two IP addresses to provide
separate DNS server programs for two domains, you can run one instance of
a DNS server (which only requires one IP address) that handles services
for an arbitrary number of domains.

Karl,

    The truth is I'm wondering if I am the problem.  I'm not sure, but
I may have let this thru without looking closely enough.  If so,
I'm sorry about the mistake.

While visiting the "Experience Music Project" in Seattle last month, I

One of these boxes needs to be the WINS server, I recommend setting the
Red Hat box, then tell the Winblowz box that the WINS server is
192.168.0.1.  If you don't set a WINS server, then you have to wait for
the "election" which can take 10-15 minutes (although you will be able
to manually "Find" the Red Hat box).  As a bonus, the smb portion of the
network will be MUCH faster if the Red Hat box is your WINS server.  I'm
assuming that the WorkGroup name is also "SEC" on the winblowz box.

Hi Derek,

Thanks for your advice.

I struggled a whole day without a solution on this simple direct connection 
with a crossover cable with no password.  Both boxes seems connected but 
they could not see each another.

1) "SEC"  is the workgroup name in WinME for connecting to other Win 
Boxes.  In this experiment I only make a direction connection between RH7.3 
and WinME boxes.
2) Shall I cross change the IP address of RH7.3 box as 192.168.0.2 and 
WinxME as 192.168.0.1
3) Shall I add follows to smb.conf

hosts allowed = yes
Browsable = yes

If YES, in which section

4) Shall I create a new directory "shared" under /tmp/share and chmod 0777 
on it


Thanks in advance.

So, if I understand you correctly all I have to do is setup DNS on my
external ip as a secondary to the internal IP as the primary and then
register the external as the primary for that domain.
Ok. I understand that part but if I ssh to a domain1.com would it still
get all the way back to the client in anywhere land?  How would the
connection hold after getting the IP which would be the same for both
domains yet the files would only exisit on one machine.  That is where I
think it all falls apart.  As pointed out by another there is no standard
that says you have to hold and send the domain name with each request and
after having the IP all traffic can travel on the number.
Correct me if I'm wrong but I do think a second IP might be the only true
solution.

Message-ID: <1028069173.25973.3.camel@summanulla.clueserver.org>

I will be bringing some copies of Redhat 7.3 and 7.3.93 beta to the next
meeting.

If you are interested, please tell me which version(s) you want and if
you want source and/or docs discs as well.

I also have Slackware 8.1, Mandrake 8.2 and FreeBSD 4.6.

I *don't* want blanks in exchange for these.  (I will accept hard cider,
however.)

Sophos Anti-Virus is pretty good.  Disclaimer: I'm a local reseller, so I'm 
biased.  You can scan e-mail, distribute updates to large numbers of 
workstations and servers, and scan files on file servers.  They have 
excellent support and are very quick with virus signature updates.  See

Despite Wil's bias, it's good advice :-) I've used Sophos at my last 
two jobs; it's performed flawlessly and, importantly, pretty 
unobtrusively.

Sorry, maybe I missed it, but I only remember seeing a query about setting
up DNS services.  If you are wanting to do other things as well, the
second IP is probably your best choice, and depending on your ISP,
shouldn't be to expensive (I think I pay about $5-$10/mo. extra for each
of my two blocks of 8 IP addresses).  Of course, for some services this
isn't necessary if you really want to avoid this, you can simply setup
many services on alternate ports on the external server.  One example
would be web services on the internal server,  setup an alternate port
on the external server to use for the service and forward that to the
usual port on the internal server, and for easy access, you could even put
a page on the external server that redirects the person to the alternate
port for those wanting access to the internal server.  For ssh, you could
setup an alternate port as well and forward it to the internal server, but
for people using this alternate port, they would need to either specify
the port as a command line option when running ssh, or set the port for
accessing the internal server in their ssh configuration file (it allows
this to be set on a per-host basis for the version I am running).  This
actually even adds a slight bit of security for the internal server, since
most probes will not be looking for ssh on an alternate port.  Of course
how practical the alternate port solution is depends on who will be
accessing the internal server.

Wil,

  Does this accommodate a variable length of white space that may be there?
I do like it, though, and I think it's safe enough to try without risking
the loss of all incoming messages.

I don't use Postfix, so I can't answer the question directly, but I 
suspect its regex engine would have some way of tokenizing whitespace. 
Two common ways of doing this would be

^Subject:\s*$             -- Perl
^Subject:[[:blank:]]*$    -- gawk/posix

It's likely just a matter of learning how Postfix does this.

Rich, as written it allows no white space the $ right after the : means 
:END_OF_LINE.

As Paul suggested /^Subject:\s*$/ would be aa regular expression to 
fit this situation.  Since you started using Postfix recently you 
probably have Perl compatible regular expressions, an option in 
recent postfix releases.

My favorite quote:

    Nevertheless, civil disobedience against a company's greed is not
    effective when it is expressed through your own greed. The people 
    of the Boston tea party dumped the tea so that nobody could use
    it. That made a much more powerful statement than if they had
    stolen the tea.

That historical analogy is so appropriate I can't imagine why I
haven't seen it earlier. What a great job digging out the history --
and the politico-moral point for today.

The legalized cracking for record companies thing I find mind boggling. It 
sounds like some crazy science fiction story.

This thing can't be serious can it? It has got to be one of the stupidest 
ideas I have heard in awhile.

That is a slippery slope if ever there was one -- once corporations can 
crack legally, the list of actionable items will inevitably grow.

  D'accord. So, Paul, how do we dump the content over which the
entertainment industry is so concerned? Or, what's the equivalent? That's
what I wondered when I read the story.

  I don't have speakers or a dvd drive on any machines here. I use a stereo
for music and the TV/VCR combo for movies. (I wouldn't haul cattle in my
Pathfinder, either <g>). Yet, I'm bothered that I might be negatively
impacted as "punishment" for something I haven't/don't/won't be doing.

In Debian, there is "amavis" (find it with google), and
"scannerdaemon" (from Openantivirus.org).  Amavis interfaces the mail
system to any of several virus scanners, both free and commercial.

Well, no big deal, provided it did not infect anyone's silly unsecured
windows machines.

To all list admins: When you go to approve unsubscriber posts, please
check the contents very carefully.  This virus was in a MIME message,
it contained a base64 encoded file marked as MIME type "audio/x-wav"
(IIRC) with a file extension of ".bat".  I guess that is what makes a
misconfigured Outbreak Express run the thing.

Should we just reject or should we send them a nastygram also?

I don't know the address and am probably remembering this wrong, but if you 
head south on Milwaukee from Holgate, it'll be on your left just after you 
pass over 99E?  There is no signage but you should see a large blue/white 
metal-sided building with a couple of racks on the sidewalk.  Just past this 
building is some sort of olive importer and if you pass the Skybox sports 
bar, you've gone too far.

For these things, it's probably best to just reject.

All these free CDs and I can't get to the meeting :(
Seriously, I'd love a copy of either - I'm in the process of weaning my way
off my Windows machine.
If there's anyway I could get a CD for Debian or RH I'd love it.

I've been meaning to ask someone who uses it, perhaps you do...

How is 3.0?  My last experience was with 2.2r2, which got hosed
by an attempted Progeny upgrade.  It was still beta, I knew what
I was getting into so I'm not complaining.

My main complaint with Debian, and a sticking point with any
package-based distro, is that it _seemed_ that popular (read:
new) .debs were always months behind release of the software.
There wasn't enough community support behind packaging apps
in .deb format, thus no resource equivalent to rpmfind.net.

Has that aspect changed much?  Other than that issue I found
it to be superb.

/eli

DISCLAIMER:
I'm not trolling for anything here.  I'm only mentioning one
aspect of an otherwise great distribution.  Merely a comparison
to services/availability from other vendors.

I'm getting mighty impatient waiting for KDE3.0.  But generally unstable
and testing are not all *that* far behind AFAIK.  And I finally got
brave enough to go to the maintainer's sites and upgrade an expendable
machine to Gnome2 and KDE3.  Can't wait to get home to see 'em.

8-) I'm ONE of the people to ask.  There's a growing number of PLUG
members using the Debian GNU toolkit these days.

It was probably not really all that hosed.  You should have asked for
some assistance!  It likely could have been fixed with little trouble
and no data loss at all.

In the "unstable" branch, the new upstream release is quite often
followed very shortly by a new Debian release.  When that does not
happen is when the new upstream release represents a major change that
makes the automatic upgrade process difficult, breaks peoples systems
(library upgrades, scripts break, etc.), or is considered too unstable
to use yet (though that's usually not the big one in "unstable" unless
the upstream software is still at the alpha or early beta release
status).

So, if you must live at the bleeding edge, just change your
sources.list to point to "unstable", or, put both stable and unstable
in there, and use the "man apt_preferences" mechanism to control what
you actually install.

The thing with distribution maintenance is that you don't want to
break a million computer systems out there on the net.  When they all
trust you to provide working software systems, that they don't have to
futz around with all day to get working (so they can get on with THEIR
job), you can't go and toss a brand new and untested software release
into the mix and just hope it works.  This is why there are several
branches -- stable (woody), testing (sarge), and unstable (sid).

The more things stay the same, the more things change.  Debian
unstable is a moving target and always will be.  It is still superb,
of course.

I think that ``misconfigured" is the wrong word to use, if you are
talking about the Outlook server. IIRC, there is no simple way to keep
the server part of Outlook from forwarding an infected email to one
& all. On the other hand, the Outlook client *can* be configured to at
least slow down these malignant missives: what I do is search thru
all of the menus & disable everything I don't see a use for -- java,
javascript, HTML -- & everything that I don't understand. This
instinctive mistrust of Outlook has saved me at least once.

This is bound to annoy network admins who plan on forcing you to
upgrade your Windows computers by sending you a specialy-designed
email. They deserve the aggravation for doing something stupid.

For what it's worth: when you get an infected email attachment,
the icon Outlook selects to represent the attachment looks an awful
lot like a tapeworm inside a page.

> Should we just reject or should we send them a nastygram also?

If someone is sending out virus-infected emails, I would think it is a
courtesy to alert them to the fact their computer has a problem. All
of us make a stupid mistake once in a while, & the sooner someone politely
informs the computer owner of the problem, the sooner the problem can be
fixed.

However, if the alerted party acts like a jerk (e.g., ``buzz off you
elitist Lin-sucks a-hole, my computer's fine"), then by all means pass
her/his name to the RBL group of your choice & let the jerk suffer.

Well, one solution is to use "unstable".  I do, and rarely have
problems.  

Another solution if you want newer versions is to "build-your-own".
I do this with Samba, because the Debian-packaged Samba has a bunch of
unwanted dependencies, like CUPS, last time I looked.

My understanding is that the "stable" packages don't get new versions,
but bug fixes are often incorporated in package revisions.

I haven't been able to use up2date in several days now due
to the "high load - subscribers only" condition. This is the
first time I've tried to update in about a month, so maybe
it's just a bad week?

I'm especially interested, because I was planning to *buy*
a copy of 7.3 rather than get a copy of somebody else's. My
motives were two-fold: 1) to help support red-hat, and 2) to
get another "entitlement"

If they are going to be "busy" all the time, that removes
motive (2) and casts some doubt on (1).

Opinions?

There were a handful of updates this week including an ssl update so the
servers have been busy.. I got through on my second try, aprox 8:30am.

That's why I bought a copy too even though I also use a downloaded iso's
as well.

If you want to give some money to RedHat and you don't want to wait in
line for the up2date services you could just sign up for their
subscription services which give you faster bandwidth and download
priorities through up2date..

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0207311632500.31416-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I upgraded LyX to 1.2.0, but when I try to invoke it I learn there's a
undefined symbol in one of the shared libraries. So, I run ldd with the -r
option, but all that tells me is that there's an undefined symbol:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ ldd -r `which lyx`
	libforms.so.0.88 =>
/usr/X11R6/lib/libforms.so.0.88 (0x4001e000)

        libSM.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libSM.so.6 (0x400ad000)
        libICE.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libICE.so.6 (0x400b6000)
        libX11.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6 (0x400ce000)

undefined symbol: __dynamic_cast_2      (/usr/bin/lyx)

  Does this tell me what library is missing or where the undefined symbol is
supposed to be? I'm really puzzled by this.

This brings up an interesting question. I was just looking at
this on their web page. The "per system" basic subscription is
$60/year. This actually sounds pretty reasonable. However...
when I view my "entitlements" it appears that this "basic subscription"
is exactly what I already have, from the last time I bought a
package (7.2)

So, I'm a little confused. Perhaps, what I can see on the web page
just doesn't distinguish between a "real" subscription that I've
paid for and one that I got by buying the CD?  Or maybe.... the
"entitlement" I have from buying the CD has actually expired in
terms of being a subscription, but still works on an "as-bandwidth-
available" basis?  I guess there are a lot of possibilities.

Anybody know the details of how this actually works?

Come to think of it, has anybody here actually bought a subscription
"directly" (not just by buying the CDs?)

I don't know if buying RH qualifies you to RHN.  I have never bought RH 
discs, but just spent the $60 on one year of RHN.  Am very happy with the

Yeah, those directions are about as good as I can get too--just look for the

KDE 3.0.2, at least, was a fairly easy (although quite long) compile. 
It took optimizations pretty well, too... and I love my optimizations. 
:-)

I don't know of any released distros except for Slackware that come with
KDE3 packages, so compiling your own might be the best way to go.

$60 a year seems way overboard (to me, at least).

Microsoft charges $100 every two years to keep up with the latest and
greatest.  And you get free updates via the web... and the servers seem
darned fast to me.

Just my two cents...

SuSE does. As does RedHat 7.3.

Hi All Guys

Should I forget to plug-in the broadband cable and start the PC, instead of 
plugging in the cable and rebooting the PC, are there any short-cuts 
avoiding reboot.

Thanks in advance

Do you mean the ethernet or the cable that runs into the cable modem? 
In either case, why are you rebooting?  If you need to restart your
network (still not sure why you would need to) try:

/etc/init.d/network restart

If you are running as root.

The only reasons I can come up with to reboot are if you install a new
kernel, do some hardware upgrading, want to test your new init scripts,
or want to power down the system.

You should be able to configure your distro to use the broadband, then
just re-run the network startup script for it.  Do you know what kind of
broadband connection it is?  PPPoE or not?  DHCP or static IP?  You'll
need that info to properly configure your Internet connection.  What
files to modify where, though, and what to run to restart the network
scripts... is totally dependent upon the distribution you are using.

Oops, I misread the original post.  I thought he was getting broadband.

You're totally right, that would restart networking (in RH at least),
but you should be able to just plug-and-chug if it is preconfigured.

Sorry, Rob is right about restarting the network based on the distro. 
My solution works for RH, but I am not sure about other distros.

Subject: [PLUG] OGI sponsored speakers series
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0207312106080.12179-100000@localhost.localdomain>

Thanks to Jason Dagit (of the ACM of OSU) and David Steere (professor at 
OGI), the effort to bring Richard M. Stallman to Oregon is moving forward. 
It looks like each school is going to pick up about half the cost, and he 
would most likely speak at OSU and at OGI.

While we were discussing this, we also discussed the possibility of an OGI 
sponsored speaker series. This aspect is still in the early stages of 
discussion but one thing we wanted to do is generate a list of speakers 
that people want to see.

Some examples:

Richard M. Stallman - Free Software

Eric S. Raymond - the "Open Source" perspective

Lawrence Lessig - Intellectual property

A representative of EFF - civil liberties on the Internet

Clifford Stoll - Heard he was a dynamic speaker on a couple diff topics.

Other ideas? Please help us brainstorm. Who do you think would be 
interesting and bring in a decent crowd?

Any suggestions are welcome.. Also, we have OGI interested and ACM of OSU 
is specifically interested in RMS -- but to do this it would be helpful to 
have some more co-sponsors or others who would help in some way. If you 
are interested in helping in some way let me know. If your company or 
organization wants to help in some way then let me know.

If you have ideas on entities that might want to help please provide me 
contact information or make introductions -- through email would be fine.

For the RMS visit, he will want a couple people to pass out fliers for the 
FSF and so on. Let me know if you want to volunteer to help out on that 
talk or with any of the others.

If you want to take ownership of getting a particular speaker that would 
be even better. For example, if you have contacts at an organization with 
which a potetial speaker is affiliated, that would be especially helpful.

It's not hard to use "apt-get source PKG", make a few modifications,
then build a custom .deb from it.  The main thing is to edit the
"changelog", adding a new revision, with a point release number, then
modify "rules" as required to make it configure the software the way
you want.  After you install it, use "aptitude hold PKG" to make it
not upgrade automaticly.  (It just occured to me that I don't know if
an "aptitude hold" will apply to "apt-get" also.)

Perhaps you could learn something from:

http://cvs.debian.org/boot-floppies/scripts/rootdisk/mklibs.py

Ok, I used "jigdo-lite" (see http://cdimage.debian.org/) to download
the "debian-30r0-i386-binary-1_NONUS.iso", which is Woody i386 binary
CD 1 of 7, plus part of the NON-US collection (crypto not in main).

The CD has quite a lot on it.  When it boots, you should be given a
choice of several images to boot from.  (I prefer, personally, the
"bf24" kernel.)  Documentation is on the CD.

I don't want any cider or beer, and probably won't be going to the
saloon after the meeting...  If you feel like spending some money to
support Debian GNU/Linux and Software in the Public Interest, I refer
you to:

  http://www.debian.org/donations

The box of CD's cost me $9.00; It's on me this time.  I made one
coaster, one that has no NON-US stuff on it, and 8 with the works.

You can pass a command line via ssh like this:
ssh -l user machine command
For some reason this does not work on commercial SSH on HP-UX.

To avoid the prompt, you can generate a keypair with a null passphrase,
but be sure you keep your private key private,

How do I generate a null key pair and will that always be used when I
normally ssh into the remote box?
I also found a way to do it by using expect.

for those curious here is the script I found:

#!/usr/bin/expect -f
log_user 0
spawn /usr/bin/rsync /etc -ar --delete --copy-unsafe-links -l -t -e ssh
user at remote.site.com:./expect "password: "
send "secret\n"
log_user 1

Just not sure I like the password in plain text in a file.

I think you can "echo NNNN > /proc/sys/fs/file-max", or, if your disto
uses "sysctl", edit "/etc/sysctl.conf" and set it there, then run
"sysctl -p".

You can read about that proc file in the Linux kernel Documentation/
directory.  (grep for it)

You'll probably find your script is a little overboard.  :-)

ssch -c /usr/bin/rsync /etc -ar --delete --copy-unsafe-links -l -t -e
ssh

(sorry about wordwrapping, I couldn't help it with this client)

Check out the info at
http://www.puddingonline.com/~dave/publications/SSH-with-Keys-HOWTO/document/html-one-page/SSH-with-Keys-HOWTO.html for a quick howto about ssh keys.  It isn't the exact page I used (I launch Mozilla on the server from my P2 266 to speed things up a little) but it looks like it'll do the job for you.  :-)

Have fun!

I would say just to reject.  Odds are all the headers on
virus-initiated messages are forged anyhow, so getting a message back to
them is all but impossible.

Hi Jon, Rob and others

Thanks for your advice.

It works

If I re-edit  /etc/X11/XF86Config-4,  is there an alternative to execute 
the new file instead of rebooting the PC

One additional question.
=================
I use dynamic IP address.  It takes time to detect it at starting the PC, 
occasionally exceeding 3 mininutes.  Is there any way to expedite its 
detection.

One thought coming to my mind is to input an IP address, to be found from 
ISP, to network configuration file.  However in case this IP address taken 
up some body else then I can't get an IP address automatically.  Is there 
any solution ?

Thanks in advance.

Just a FYI, but OGI & the IEEE have been teaming up for at least a couple
of years now to present their own series of lectures on the high tech
industry. Some of us may remember the presentation IBM gave on Linux
that was hosted at OGI last year: this is one example of their lecture
series.

Since I pay dues as an associate member of the IEEE, I would be more than
happy to see some of that money go to bring an Open Source speaker to
Oregon.

You're right, it is down...

Pings go through ok, and FTP still goes strong.  Just HTTP seems to be
down.  I posted to AOLS... if I don't hear anything back, I guess I'll
send Pat an email.

He's been busy working on the Alpha port lately, I think.

Just bring it down to St. Paul and we'll take care of the system.  Can't
launch it out of a cannon, but we *can* blow it to hell and back with a
fun little arsenel.  AR-15, .270, 12-guage, and .22......

The little 486 never stood a chance.  :-)
