Subject: [PLUG] Sorting A Text File on Multiple Fields
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1109011034300.12926@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have a largish file with 4 fields, separated by the '|' symbol. Reading
the sort man page suggests that I can sort on only the first field and I
want to sort on the first field, then on the second field, then on the third
field.

   Trying to sort just the first field causes bash to complain bitterly:

[rshepard at salmo ~/projects/nevada/queenstake/stats]$ sort -t=| streams.txt >
out.txt
-bash: ./streams.txt: Permission denied

   sort didn't like the -o=outputfile option so I tried redirecting.

   What other tool would allow me to do a hierarchical sort of a 15K row
file?

   Thanks, Hal. I realized this, too. Now I need to understand how to apply
the -k option so it sorts 1, 2 within 1, then 3 within 2 within 1.

wes,

   In my experience spreadsheets are the absolute worst tool to do this job.
If you sort column 1 and forget to highlight all the others, only column 1
is sorted. When trying to sort on internal columns it gets even worse. This
is one way folks using spreadsheets as databases screw up their data and
make it totally useless and unrecoverable.

Hal,

   Thank you. I tried "-k1,2,3" and learned k takes no more than 2 values.
Using 1,3 seems to do the trick.

I haven't tackled 1.8, but it's probably the same as 1.6.  The short answer
is probably "extensions.conf".  If you get stuck, send me that file off-list
and I can probably get you unstuck.

I agree. That's why I always use a database for a task like this.

...and yet the *ix shell environments are chock full of underrated and 
underutilized tools such as sort, cut, grep, sed, awk, etc., etc. that 
are much quicker to pick up far more appropriate for working with flat 
files than a DBMS.

   Many thanks.

   This is one of many linux tools that I use infrequently, but when needed
they're the only tools for the job.

Your problem is that '|' is a shell metacharacter.  You have to quote
it or backwhack it for your command to work correctly:

	sort -t\| streams.txt >out.txt

   For context, I'm running statistical analyses of water chemistry data. For
now, the 148 sampling sites are much too fine a resolution; the Q-Q plots,
x-y plots, box-and-whisker plots are so jammed that only the broadest trends
can be seen.

   So, I'm combining sites by stream and now need to hand-modify the results
so I can average the measured values for multiple sites on the same stream
from the same day and for the same chemical. The sort utility reformatted
the text file so all stream rows are in sequence, then the dates, then the
chemical species. I can't think of a tool to find multiple rows of stream +
date + chemical then average the measured values and delete the redundant
rows. Tedious work.

   But, once I'm done with this I'll use awk to add the two major drainage basins
to the rows for each stream.

   These tools are great, but they cannot do everything (including making
another pot of coffee.)

You control the outbound by defining the context in chan_dahdi.conf
Just make sure you have a corresponding context in your dialplan.

The Digium user guide has great instructions...

If you don't have the KVM selecting a machine when it boots, no video

Wayne,

   This certainly confirms everyone else's advice. Must be a feature copied
from Microsoft 'cause I'm used to rebooting only when I've installed a new
kernel.

   Regardless, Sunday morning when mail traffic is light and most folks are
sleeping off Saturday night's excesses, I'll shut down the host, swap
monitors and cables, and boot it back up. I'm certain from what you and
Galen tell me that I'll be happy with the results.

Many thanks,

Rich

There are KVMs out there that will send a return signal to the hosts even if the KVM is not pointed at that machine. Raritan is one brand that does this.

Thanks Russell. I quickly checked on them. The ones I saw look pretty

Star Trek Voyager ended in like 2001 or so.  Star Trek Deep Space Nine
was over about the same time or sooner than that.  My dad has lots of
recordings of episodes, but they are probably low quality and his
collection is undoubtedly incomplete.  I want him to throw them out,
these VHS tapes take up a lot of space.  He probably will throw them
out if I can get DVD copies of both series.  I'll be happy if I can
master to mpeg4 files say 3 or 4, no more than 14 please, DVDs.  That
takes up a lot less space than say 30+ VHS tapes.  Question, is there
an inexpensive alternative to startrek.com's $300+ DVD sets?  Problem 1,
that is a lot of money for a series that I've watched most of.  Problem
2, I'm concerned that these DVD's won't copy so I can play them off of
hard disk under CentOS 5.6.

What do people think of http://www.free-tv-video-online.me/ ?

I am not so sure that I like the you have won redirects that they do,
they give you very little time to claim whatever and they want a cell
phone number.  What's worse, it looks like they don't have a complete
episode set for either of the Star Trek series that I mentioned earlier.
The site seems too good to be true to me.  Does anyone know of a
legitimate site where you download as mp4s specific old television shows
very inexpensively or free?

With MythTV so popular, I wonder if there are any Linux enthusiast
networks that share decent quality recordings of old shows? Why reinvent
the wheel if I don't have to?

What I don't want to do is download a low quality knockoff from some
random site and get in trouble.  I see nothing wrong with someone who
has a decent recording of what I want sharing it with me for very little
or nothing.

Ten seconds with Google and Amazon suggest that you can shave some
money of that, but ultimately?  Probably not.  Lots of DVDs are priced
at lots of dollars, new, because the owner of that content doesn't
have any competition in sale, only end-point retailers do.

> What do people think of http://www.free-tv-video-online.me/ ?

Like many things, it is an attempt to dress up illegal activity in a
veneer of legitimacy.  Not quite as bad as the places that charge $50
to suckers, who receive in return the lie that downloading this
content is now legal, but not too much further up the ladder.

They still feature the pleasant, but untrue, lie that they do not
"encourage illegal conduct", since they are knowingly encouraging
people to break a bad, stupidly enforced, nasty, but very real law.

That would be because they are linking to illegal copies of the
content, uploaded to the Internet, under the pretence that this
somehow makes them magically legal.  (Which, the courts of the world
say, has a definite maybe attached, for linking.)

If you are going to break the law, stop being a sucker, and just go
download from somewhere that makes to bones about it violating the
law.  Seriously, there isn't a way, other than a Netflix subscription
or equivalent, that any of what you are doing is going to be any more
or less legal here.

There is no such site.  It does not exist.  Sorry.

Daniel

...and, yes, I *know* that you think this *should* be legal.  Which
doesn't alter the fact that the law is, indeed, an ass, and what you
want isn't in line with the current laws.

You can usually find used on ebay for a fairly reasonable price. If you are using commodity PC hardware, you don't need the high end Raritan KVM over IP stuff. I do recommend the units that use CIM adapters, as those have the most flexibility regarding ps/2 vs usb. If you connect to machines with PS/2 ports only, then you can even use the older units that you can get for a song. Or, you can do what I do and put a $5 USB<>PS/2 adapter in the back of your PCs, and use the old reliable units.

For all the same reasons as Daniel, no. 

If you are going to download them, use bittorrent. Just don't do it on Comcast, as they are part of NBC/Paramount, and they own the copyright to Star Trek.

Excuse you.  This is not a PLUG-talk topic considering that using a
Linux based server as the media server is a PLUG topic.  I'm trying to
ask what is legal as far as recording of live television and long term
archival of those recordings.  I'm also trying to ask, what is there to
stop me legally from copying copyrighted commercial DVDs that I have
purchased where I intend to air the copy privately from my Linux based
server?  If there are legal verses illegal ways to go about this, I want
to know about that.  Do TiVOs and the like not keep the recording long
term?  How about services like Comcast's On Demand?  If I were to
publish a HOWTO on recording live television with a Linux based server
or converting DVDs/Blu Rays to a file for private viewing, would that be
illegal?  The technical question of can it be done seems to be answered,
the problem is what about the legal side of this?  From a technical
standpoint, there is very little difference from a digital recording on
a hard disk verses one on a Blu Ray disc.  As far as the don't talk
about this comments, if this isn't ever talked about publicly it
definitely won't be legal and people not doing it will make it even less
so.

Concerning the plug-talk piracy accusation, I am not a pirate and I
don't condone piracy either.  Pirates are people who acquire copyrighted
materials illegally and sell those copies or give those copies away free
of charge.  If I copy my Windows installation for later retrieval in the
event of hard disk failure, I am not a pirate.  If I do this for a Linux
based system, I am definitely not a pirate.  Furthermore, if I copy a
copyrighted movie that aired on television using a Linux based server, I
am not a pirate.  

Where does you can only have the copy for so long come into play?  Show
me the law that says you can only view a copyrighted show so many times
if you record it off of the air or you copy it from a legally purchased
DVD.  I have never heard of such a law.  In fact, I have heard quite the
opposite.

Saying that hard drive copies, CDs, and DVDs not produced by the
copyright holder are carte blank illegal is a ridiculous definition of
piracy.  There is a clear difference between piracy and making a private
software/video collection accessible and usable.  It used to be that you
could make backup CDs of the installation files for Windows easily.
This was legal if you purchased your copy and didn't share it with
others.  This was reasonable in a day and age when Windows still got
distributed on floppy disks.  Was it safer to purchase genuine CDs?
Yes, of course.  But the genuine CDs were and still are prohibitively
expensive.  I am not saying that it is legal to bypass the technical
barrier to copying Windows install files in order to share them, that is
piracy.  I emphatically disagree with the notion that all copying is
piracy.  If people don't defend legitimate copying, this definition of
piracy will probably take hold though in time. 

I hate that Microsoft doesn't give most people install disks anymore.
You can make a backup that will install to a specific computer, but you
can't make install disks.

If the only thing I can put on a Linux based media server is non
copyrighted material, what's the point?  Yes, it is nice to have a
server that can dump family photos and family movies to the television.
Streaming your purchased and personal DVDs and VHS movies to hard disk
seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to do.  If this isn't legal, it
should be.  I have no intention of copying borrowed materials from a
library.  I'm being picked on for talking about media in general and I
don't appreciate this.

I will not be silenced on this subject for fear that it will lead to
unfair and unjust laws being passed.  Imagine a world where you can't
even share Linux because everything has to come from the copyright
holder.  Maybe this kind of world will materialize if everyone shuts up.

Stop with this rudeness.  PLUG Talk is a don't respect or listen to each
other politely rag that I have no intention of partaking of.  It is a
junk list where my views and beliefs rarely match those of anyone else
who posts on there.  Nothing was answered by your post on plug-talk.
All you did is call me a pirate.  I have never seen opposing views on
plug-talk.  Usually, one person who has a different view gets attacked
by everyone else who posts.

Since you are asking questions on what is legal, on topics subject to
debate, I suggest that you consult a lawyer. As far as I know, there are
no lawyers on this list, or on plug-talk. 

Furthermore, I suggest that you'll get a better response with kindness.
You ask for a lot of help on this list, and generally get it. Rarely do
I ever see you thanking anyone for their efforts here.

Thanks,
Mike

I haven't avoided saying Thank You, I simply haven't remembered to at
times on list.  Also, asking for help on list should make the answers
available to anyone which is a type of Thank You.

http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-3513_7-5128652-1.html

The review above isn't necessarily valid legal advice, but I think it
explains how the DMCA is causing problems with the traditional
understanding of fair use.

http://dvd-copy-review.upickreviews.com/is-copying-dvds-legal.html

Another site to look at on this issue.  I think it is ridiculous to have
a law protecting CSS encryption.  The point of CSS encryption is to stop
pirating, but it will also stop legitimate copying.  Fair use doesn't
mean you can give copies away or sell copies, but it does allow you to
make copies.

http://www.winxdvd.com/resource/rip-copy-protected-dvd.htm

Maybe this third link is to a company selling illegal software.  What
they say leans heavily though on the fair use concept.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripping

Interesting, don't know how to rate this though.  What concerns me is
that the DMCA makes circumvention of copy protection schemes apparently
illegal.  Trouble is, how can one fairly circumvent the schemes for
making legal personal use copies if it is illegal for anyone to give you
information on how to do this?  If my understanding is correct, the DMCA
should be amended.  Maybe it should be permissible to have a third party
defeat the encryption to give you one personal use only DVD without the
encryption.  Or, maybe the information to defeat the encryption should
be legal to share.  Another option, make encrypted media sold to the
public at large illegal.

http://www.pcworld.com/article/119549/dvd_ripping_flourishes.html

This fourth link is to what seems to be a good article on DVD ripping.

http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/08/judge-copying-dvds-is-illegal/

I agree with the notion that Hollywood is crippling technology and that
this is the wrong way to address losing money on DVDs, VHS, and Blu Ray
discs.  I want to ignore the whole cannot acquire or share copy
protection circumvention tools.  Otherwise, I can't play these
legitimately purchased movies off of a computer hard drive.  The problem
is definitely that the law is unclear and completely inconsistent.

Slysoft puts out AnyDVD and AnyDVD HD.  This package will only work for
21 days and it requires Windows XP or newer.  Yikes!  What's worse, the
purchase price is over $100.  There is something called DeCSS, but I
guess this is old and whether or not there is a Linux version is not
clear.

Is there anything newer that works in Linux?  Commercial is okay if the
price is reasonable.

Slysoft appears to have the best software for this, is this true?

Technically it is supposedly illegal to play DVDs on a Linux box because
of digital restrictions management and the DMCA.  This affects us all
where I hope people are working to redress this.

They use crowdsourcing to look for articles, existing technologies,
public presentations, etc. that invalidate patents, and offer
sizable rewards ($5K and higher) for research that does so.

Most of the patents in question are hard technology, but some
are software, and some may be a threat to Linux.   One example
is "INTERPRETER FOR COMPILED AND THEN CONVERTED APPLICATIONS".
That sounds a lot like Perl 6 Parrot to me, and Pascal from a
long time ago.  So this organization is relevant to protecting
Linux, and perhaps a way to make some money.

I have more important things to do right now.  Over the next
year, killing two or three patents for sport, and earning $10K
or so for the opportunity, might be a fun way to while away a 
week or two.  Getting paid for reading and thinking and writing.

Galen/Wayne,

   I took your advice and shut down the system, switched monitors, and
rebooted. The previous problems have gone away but now the monitor won't
allow me to select its default, native, maximum resolution of 1600x900 (it's
20" wide; the 19" winde monitors automatically configured to 1440x900).

   The display defaults to 1280x720 and won't let me set the highest
available: 1280x800. The refresh rate is set at 60Hz and there are no
other options.

   Is this a linux issue, a Slackware issue, a Xfce4 issue, or something
else. There no longer is an xorg.conf so I'm totally lost on how to restore
the screen to less than the size of the old PC-1 with its 640x480 resolution
and huge letters and numbers.

Suggestions, please,

Rich

Sorry that I didn't get your message earlier today. If the time on your 
machine is set right, you were at it early this morning.

In my case, Slackware 12.2, evga GeForce GT 430 graphics card, I had to 
install the nvidia driver to get to my (new) monitor's native resolution 
of 1690 x 1080. It was easy to do and works great with VGA, DVI or HDMI.

I'll be at the gym for a couple hours, so if you post and don't get an 
answer, you'll know that my fat butt is still draggin' the ground.

Wayne,

   Yes, I was. However, I forgot to check that postfix started from
/etc/rc.d/rc.local when I rebooted. It hadn't. So I started it manually much
later in the day. This is Slackware-13.1 on an ASUS M4A78LT-M LE. When I get
this working, and get the loose ends of the house remodeling tied off, I'll
install -13.37/64-bit on a new drive and replace the current one.

   lsmod shows a radeon driver installed. I don't recall what video chip is
on the Asus motherboard ... I'll go look at the manual. Which says,
Integrated ATI Radeon HD 3000 GPU. Supports max memory of 1GB. Supports
DVI-D compliant with HDCP with max. resolution 2560 x 1600 (@60Hz).

   So, it should allow me to select (if it doesn't by default) 1600 x 900.

   Any thoughts?

methinks we're gonna need to see your /var/log/Xorg.0.log (or whatever
the most recent logfile on your system from the xserver is).

Chris,

   Nothing there jumped out and bit me on the nose. It's a 70K file and
attachments are stripped from mail list messages. Where should I put it so
those who want to look at it can find it?

   Fixed it. For some reason, /etc/X11/xorg.conf still existed. I renamed it
to XXxorg.conf, killed X, and restarted it. It came up with the default
1600x900 resolution. Shrug.

Er, I don't want to rain on anyone's picnic, but there are some items
about this firm that you might want to be aware of and consider well.

I asked a couple of people about this firm who follow software patent
litigation quite closely. I received responses within minutes. Though
they didn't want to be quoted by name, they made the following points:

* AOP has some large clients like Google, and has some lucrative work.

* One person said he couldn't confirm payouts but didn't try very hard.

* The firm is a hired gun; it will do work for any client that pays it.

* It doesn't make its findings public, so the community cannot benefit.

* Marshall Phelps, former Microsoft head of licensing, is on its board.

This might be a way to make some money, but there are other
researchers that are better to work with, in my correspondents'
opinions, including the Linux Foundation, the FSF, Software Freedom
Law Center, and Pubpat, among others, even if they don't pay. And if
you follow patent lawsuits and think you can offer evidence of prior
art to a white hat defendant, you can always contact its attorneys
directly and negotiate a paid deal.

Also, if you are or might one day become a software developer, you
must be aware that reading software patents, and doing research on
prior art is *not* a good idea. If any software product you have or
might ever be connected with is ever implicated in a patent lawsuit,
infringement may be deemed "willful" if it can be inferred you were
aware of that patent.

Just some information and thoughts to consider...

Robert

Wayne,

   Family always comes first.

   What I don't understand is how the two previous monitors, both 19" wide
screens, one Acer the other Hanns-G autoconfigured to 1440x900 with
/etc/X11/xorg.conf existing. The X system changed in, I believe,
Slackware-13.0 and I thought that I discovered I had to remove that file on
the server as well as on the new Dell portable in order to get X to properly
display.

   Since the new 20" Acer is running on the same distribution version I don't
know why it balked when the previous monitors did not. That's why I didn't
look there right away.

Later,

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1109061646160.4372@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My HP Color LaserJet 2550L needed a new imaging drum which the Portland
Printer Place sold me and then installed it. Now I'm trying to use the
printer but cannot seem to communicate with it.

   According to the CUPS Web interface, it's configured as:

Description:	Color LaserJet 2550L
Location:	office
Driver:	HP Color LaserJet 2550 Series Postscript (recommended) (color,
2-sided printing)
Connection:	lpd://salmo/var/spool/cups
Defaults:	job-sheets=none, none media=na_letter_8.5x11in
sides=one-sided

   When I try to print a test page it asks for a user and password, and says
the system wants "CUPS" as the user. There is no such user in /etc/passwd,
and it won't take 'root' and its password.

   The printer prints a self-test page. The 'ready light' displays a steady
green, but the Go light (with the Go button) stays dark.

   The printer does have a local IP address: 192.168.55.194, but it's not on
an Ethernet cable to a JetDirect card.

   I'd like some suggestions for testing the situation to figure out where
it's stuck.

Has this ever worked? Did this work previously in its current configuration?
If so, you likely don't have a CUPS problem, but a USB problem - let's see
your dmesg and lsusb output.

Assuming this is a new setup:

note the line:

> Connection:     lpd://salmo/var/spool/cups

this doesn't make any sense. CUPS appears to be trying to print to itself.
Hence, the password prompt. If it's connected via USB, (plugged in to a USB
port on salmo, I hope), the line should show the location of the printing
device. something like /dev/usblp0 or similar. CUPS does try to auto-detect
USB printers - if you click Add Printer, is it listed?

In my experience, USB is a less than ideal method to communicate with a
printer. I much prefer Ethernet whenever possible.

One other note: a quick search of my distro's package repository shows this:
printconf - automatically configures USB and parallel printers with CUPS
Perhaps yours has something similar available?

Wes,

   Not here. I never got around to checking it out after buying it from
someone on Craig's List. Yesterday I saw the imager light come on when I
powered it up so I took it to Portland Printer Place and they replaced the
imager for me.

   I couldn't make sense of this line, either.

   The printer has a parallel port and it looks like the HP external
JetDirect 300x will work on this. It takes an ethernet input and converts it
to the parallel port on the printer. I can order one today if that's what
you think will work.

   I had an internal JetDirect card in the HP 2500C inkjet printer, but gave
that to Free Geek when I gave away the printer. There's also a JetDirect
card I installed in the LJ 5 so I know the network can see these nodes.

   Should I order the 300x?

Thanks,

Rich

If you value your sanity (not to mention your time), the answer to this is a
resounding YES.

I don't know how quickly you need this... if you have some time, I can look
around to see if I have one in a box somewhere. I'm pretty sure I do. Or if
you'd rather save the hassle, you can just order it.

   As soon as practical. Take a look; if you have one I'll buy it from you.
Otherwise I'll order one.

I'm not sure if I understand your question, but I'll give it a shot.  If
you're asking why those messages come up, it's because amavis will make use
of external (de)compression packages like gunzip, bunzip2, etc. if they're
available.    The ones listed above are kinds of compression/decompression
packages that amavis understands, but aren't present on your system.
They're not dependencies in the classic sense.  Amavis will work fine
without them, and mine has run for years without some packages similar to
these.  It just means that if someone sends you an e-mail with, say, a .zoo
attachment, Amavis can't decompress it to scan the contents.

The solution is either to not worry about .zoo attachments and the other
ones listed, or to install the external packages that know how to
compress/decompress these kinds of files.  You'll have to look to your
distro to find out which packages are needed to support those kinds of
files.

I hope that helps.

                            -Brian Martin

Message-ID: <4E67A6F6.6000502@cyber-office.net>

Anyone know why CUPS hangs during startup if there is a problem with the 
internet connection?

I've been having some Internet connection issues (long and erratic ping 
times, lost packets, etc.) and while trying to chase them down I 
restarted my workstation.  Every time it hangs while starting CUPS. 
Once the connection is stabilized it works fine.

What would CUPS be looking for on the internet when it is just being 
used by systems on the home/office LAN?

I did do some searching so either my search-foo is off or there is 
nothing about this specific issue.


TIA,
Rod

I used to see this on several services on startup. Sendmail used to give me
the worst problems with it. I think it's related to trying to resolve its
hostname, trying to establish it's own FQDN.

This is probably why your searching isn't turning anything up... you're
being too specific.

Yes, I've supported various formats that weren't standardly supported by
finding for example cabextract rpms or the source for freeze, etcetera.
Seems that zoo is harder to support, but there is a Slackware package
for it???  I have libraries for lzo but not lzop, don't know where to
get it.  I guess the question becomes, how do you reject anything you
don't have a scanner for and generate a message about who sent it and
other information for the intended recipient?

Another problem, I'm getting about 2-3 different errors in my mail log
that seem to be coming from amavis.

Sep  7 09:04:20 xerxes amavis[12705]: (12705-03) (!)Mail::ClamAV

I suspect that virus scanning isn't working at all where I haven't done
much with the spam assassin part.  For example, how do I avoid changing
the header if I don't virus scan or spam assassin scan it?  I have some
server generated messages that need to be left unchanged.

I slap my forehead and "Say why didn't I think of that!".  Because I 
vaguely remember a similar problem.  That time I believe I put hosts 
before bind in host.conf and a specific entry for the workstation.

Obviously doesn't work for this.  Probably CUPS trying to be clever.

I'll try the option three solution.

Thanks.

Subject: [PLUG] [OT] Problems in the ReactOS community...
Message-ID: <1315428673.2547.19.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

Windows, especially NT based Windows, is beyond the scope of Freedos.
Unfortunately, there have been suggestions to look at the ReactOS
project.  I think this transcript which needs to get out despite the
rules details why the ReactOS project is a disaster that needs to be
cleaned up.  Anyone can work on an OSS project.  Keyword here is anyone.
Please, someone go ahead and get the code, form another community, and
continue development if this project is still 
worthwhile.

Supposedly, Linux+WINE is not a better way to go, but the way things are
going in the ReactOS community, I'd have to say that it is a better way
to go.

Is there a way I can complain about the reactos.org site and get them
sanctioned?  Taking the site down would be a good way to adjust
attitudes in that community.

Here is a transcript showing how bad ReactOS IRC has gotten:

-NickServ- You failed to identify in time for the nickname Michael
* You are now known as Guest39028
<Guest39028> Why is logging in as zimbra messed up? 
* Wr4i7h (~abc at a89-154-41-86.cpe.netcabo.pt) has joined #reactos
<Guest39028> Is anyone else's forum login screwed up?
<}i{> sudo #reactos
<Guest39028> Syllable being a different OS doesn't have to be directly
compatible with Windows and better yet there are efforts to use portable
programming languages like REBOL soon to be replaced with RED.  Why
develop ReactOS which has to mimic Windows?
* zwabbit (~chatzilla at dyn-72-33-240-42.uwnet.wisc.edu) has joined
#reactos
<ThFabba> Because it's fun
* zwabbit has quit (Changing host)
* zwabbit (~chatzilla at reactos/developer/ZWabbit) has joined #reactos
* ChanServ gives channel operator status to zwabbit
<Guest39028> The Syllable approach may make more sense in the long run.
One of the major problems with Windows has been that it doesn't just
work.  If Windows was the dominant server system that would be one
thing, but it isn't.
<Guest39028> People are writing commercial software for Linux now which
is somewhat similar to MacOS, why not Syllable?
* _dk has quit (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
<Guest39028> Syllable admittedly has problems with SATA and probably
isn't 64 bit, but ReactOS isn't 64 bit either.
* hyoenmadan (~oemlic654 at 189.177.124.164) has joined #reactos
<Guest39028> Why ReactOS over Syllable???
<Guest39028> Is anyone else's forum login screwed up?
<zwabbit> what's your login name
* Wr4i7h has quit ()
<Guest39028> zimbra
<zwabbit> because daniel banned you?
<Guest39028> Since when?
<zwabbit>
http://www.reactos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=8852&hilit=zimbra&start=15#p82148
<Guest39028> I can't view anything on the forum, so why are you
bothering?
<Guest39028> My account is so screwed up, that I can't set the language
correctly and I can't even look at the forum.
<zwabbit> then don't sign in
<Guest39028> Too late.
<zwabbit> it's not hard to log out................
* }i{ has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
<zwabbit> go to the myRosCMS page and on the left hand side there's a
logout link
<Guest39028> I've posted so much that I assumed I wouldn't be banned,
especially considering that there were no loggers.
<Guest39028> I've posted so much that I assumed I wouldn't be banned,
especially considering that there were no warnings.
<zwabbit> there is no rule that a warning needs to be given before a ban
<zwabbit> and all of the posts that preceded your final post can be
regarded as implicit warnings by the rest of the community with respect
to your behavior
* evilslon has quit (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
<Guest39028> I disagree strongly.
<zwabbit> as is your right
* }i{ (~Ninja at unaffiliated/registered) has joined #reactos
<zwabbit> doesn't mean we need to act upon that disagreement
<Guest39028> Breaking the whole entire account and not just letting
people see a warning seems ridiculous.
<Guest39028> Why doesn't the language have to default to something wrong
and worse why does the screen go blank when you try to log in?
<Guest39028> Why does the language have to default to something wrong
and worse why does the screen go blank when you try to log in?
<zwabbit> because that's how our cms currently works
<zwabbit> it handles bans badly
<zwabbit> so when the need arises to do one
<zwabbit> it doesn't completely shut out a person's account
<smiley1_> we accept patches though :P
<Guest39028> What makes you think that bans need to be done anyways?
<zwabbit> daniel felt that you were going to continue antagonizing other
people in the community
<zwabbit> i did not see a reason to overrule him
<Guest39028> Well, define antagonize?  If people hearing something they
don't want to hear is antagonizing them I don't see how the forums can
work at all.
<Guest39028> Daniel has never said anything to me and frankly I don't
think he was a moderator historically.
<zwabbit> he's been a moderator for at least two years now, if not
longer
<zwabbit> and your point about people hearing things they don't want can
be directed at yourself
<Guest39028> What you just said makes absolutely no sense and if we are
referring to discrimination noone should have to listen to that.
<zwabbit> we've had multiple incidences where people pointing out
mistakes/flaws in your argument resulting in you insulting them or
starting an argument with them about how they are wrong
<Guest39028> I've never argued with people like you say.
<Guest39028> I don't insult people.
<zwabbit> you do know who i am on the forum, right?
<Guest39028> Maybe I've complained about being called a troll, who
wouldn't.
* hyoenmadan has quit (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
<Guest39028> I don't care who you are on the forum.

<smiley1_> lol
<andermetalsh> hello, is virtualbox bug with mshtml/gecko solved?
<zwabbit> zwabbit = Z98
* hyoenmadan (~oemlic654 at 189.177.124.164) has joined #reactos
<Guest39028> No wonder I get treated so harshly by Zwabbit.
<zwabbit> smiley1_: have i treated him harshly since i entered?
<smiley1_> zwabbit: I have stoped reading nute's posts since ages
<smiley1_> how should I know?
<zwabbit> i meant today in the channel
<smiley1_> ah this. then no
<ThFabba> andermetalsh: the hang if you have hardware virtualization
disabled? Not yet :| It's a hard one
<Guest39028> we've had multiple incidences where people pointing out
mistakes/flaws in your argument resulting in you insulting them or
starting an argument with them about how they are wrong"... On what
exactly.
<smiley1_> Guest39028: "I get treated so harshly" <= you  really don't
know Alex_Ionescu
* }i{ has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
<Guest39028> Alex who?
<Guest39028> You mean the supposed leader of this project?
<smiley1_> he is not the leader
<smiley1_> he wrote the half kernel
<smiley1_> the leaders is Aleksey
* Alex_Ionescu (~Alex_Ione at pdpc/supporter/active/AlexIonescu) has joined
#reactos
* ChanServ gives voice to Alex_Ionescu
<andermetalsh> TheXception|off,  yeah, my CoreDuo CPU does not support
neither hardware VT or KVM/Qemu
<zwabbit> this should be interesting.................
<smiley1_> lol
<Guest39028> zwabbit, what is the point of you saying I argue with
people without listening to what they say if you won't be more
specific???
<zwabbit> let's see
<andermetalsh> I think it's an issue with how reactos handles  VBox i386
CPU 
<zwabbit> you've started threads claiming that reactos' goal is
pointless
<zwabbit> you've started threads claiming that our development
priorities are wrong
<Guest39028> That isn't very specific, and it's a valid topic of
discussion one could argue.
<andermetalsh> cos VBox CPU is not an "exact" Intel CPU 
<smiley1_> not to mention the endless lists of questions
<andermetalsh> with Qemu, Reactos works 
<Alex_Ionescu> i thought this was going to be fun
<Alex_Ionescu> i don't see any fun
<smiley1_> that you need hours to respond
<zwabbit> Alex_Ionescu: you missed part of it
<Alex_Ionescu> is Guest the fun guy?
<zwabbit> you've repeated questions i don't know how many times asking
about the progress of the project and get irritated when we say the
answers haven't changed the last time we answered them
<zwabbit> Alex_Ionescu: for varying definitions of fun
<Alex_Ionescu> Guest39028: will you ride my magic pony?
<Guest39028> The question of where the project is always valid.
<zwabbit> and the answer that nothing has changed is equally valid
<KlausM> LOL @ Alex_Ionescu 
<Guest39028> The question of where the project is always valid.  I don't
ask all the time.
<ThFabba> andermetalsh: I'm not much into it, but AFAIK, it's some
memory corruption that happens to only manifest as a problem under these
specific circumstances. These things are ugly :|
<Guest39028> Too bad nothing has changed.
<smiley1_> "I don't ask all the time" <= are you sure?
<Alex_Ionescu> Guest39028 if you won't ride my magic pony I will get
angry
<zwabbit> not everytime, more like after every release
<Alex_Ionescu> You wouldn't like me when I'm angry
<Guest39028> I don't have to be.  You can figure this out yourself.
<Guest39028> Well, there hasn't been another release in a very long
time.
<zwabbit> you also refuse to accept corrections to your statements even
when they are demonstratably false
<Guest39028> Prove that I'm demonstrably false.
<Alex_Ionescu> ?this is really boring, where's my op status
<Alex_Ionescu> He's ignoring me
<andermetalsh> BTW, does reactos have hardware 3d acceleration? 
<Guest39028> What is the point of point blank saying that I'm
demonstrably false if you won't be specific other than to tick me off?
<zwabbit> andermetalsh: no, unfortunately
<Alex_Ionescu> Maybe I should sing a song
<andermetalsh> at least with 3dfx or so ...
<Alex_Ionescu> TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR
<smiley1_> andermetalsh: not yet
<andermetalsh> I thought 3d support was supplied by the drivers 
<zwabbit> Guest39028: last time you were in this channel before you got
kicked out, you claimed that microsoft would never contribute code to
the linux kernel
<Alex_Ionescu> OH IWONDER HOW YOU ARE
<zwabbit> i presented you with direct evidence of microsoft doing
exactly that
<Alex_Ionescu> UP ABOVE THE SKY SO HIGH
<zwabbit> and when i asked you to retract your statement, you refused to
do so
<Guest39028> What, I don't think so.  Besides, keeping a transcript of
what is said on here is not allowed.
<Alex_Ionescu> LIKE A SOMETHING IN THE SKY
<Alex_Ionescu> TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR
<Alex_Ionescu> HOW I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE
<Alex_Ionescu> LIKE A DIAMOND*
<zwabbit> we do not permit third parties to publish logs of this channel
<zwabbit> we however do keep them for internal purposes
<KlausM> Alex_Ionescu, when you said ride your pony did you mean that
unicorn that pukes rainbows?
<Alex_Ionescu> KlausM: yes
<Guest39028> Then you can see that I've gotten into discussions that had
nothing to do with reactos on here and that there was no right or wrong.
<Alex_Ionescu> not just that but in fact...
<Alex_Ionescu> a HUMAN CENTIPEDE
<Alex_Ionescu> PUKING
<Alex_Ionescu> UNICORN
<Alex_Ionescu> MAGIC
<Alex_Ionescu> PONY
<KlausM> don't you mean human cenIpad?
* KlausM dukes
<Alex_Ionescu> with Guest39028 in the middle
* STRAIDER has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
<zwabbit> and we don't care when you don't get into trouble
<KlausM> *uckes
<zwabbit> we only take note when you do get into trouble
<zwabbit> cause that's the only time we're ever drawn into the
discussion
<Alex_Ionescu> just make sure I won't be eating any CUTTLEFISH
<Alex_Ionescu> OOOOH KYLUUUU
<KlausM> ha ha ha
<Alex_Ionescu> CANNOT RESISTU
<Alex_Ionescu> THE CUTTLEFISHU
<Guest39028> How nice, only note when a guy screws up and treat him
likes he is a perpetual screw up.
<Alex_Ionescu> hey guest here's one for you
<Alex_Ionescu> A MAN THAT BUILDS 1000 BRIDGES
<Alex_Ionescu> BUT SUCKS ONE COCK
<Alex_Ionescu> IS NOT A BRIDGE BUILDER
<Alex_Ionescu> HE IS A COCK SUCKER!
<Alex_Ionescu> - Aristotle
<KlausM> Alex_Ionescu, I'll quote that one on g+
<zwabbit> that we have never had reason to take notice when you're not
getting into trouble would also indicate that you haven't contributed in
a way for us to notice
<Guest39028> Alex, why are you being disgusting?
<Alex_Ionescu> omg finally
<Guest39028> OMG is highly offensive, don't take God's name in vain
please.
<zwabbit> when weighed against the times you have caused trouble, it
would be why we do not hesitate in banning you when we feel the need
<Alex_Ionescu> Guest39028: as his son, i'm allowed
* STRAIDER (~STRAIDER at 85.26.186.164) has joined #reactos
* zwabbit is atheist so doesn't care
<Alex_Ionescu> my real name is LXNSC
<Alex_Ionescu> but you're not allowed saying it
<Guest39028> You are not God's son in the sense that Jesus is, you are
not His equal.  Therefore, you do NOT have a right to speak offensively,
though you obviously have the ability to.
<Alex_Ionescu> so i've added some vowels in there to make it easier for
you mere mortals
<hyoenmadan> hey, here are people that believe in something, be more
respectful guys!!
<hyoenmadan> you?re programmers, no kids
<smiley1_> lol @ LXNSC
<zwabbit> hyoenmadan: you have unfortunately walked into alex deciding
to toy with someone
<Alex_Ionescu> smiley1_: yeah me and YHWH party it up all the time
<Guest39028> Alex can toy with someone quite rudely and he doesn't get
banned, but if I try to do that...
<smiley1_> lol
<smiley1_> Guest39028: you will get in this state if you contribute what
alex has :P
<ThFabba> That's because he has this magic plus next to his name
<Guest39028> Why is atheism so important to Alex anyways?
<Alex_Ionescu> i'm not atheist, zwabiit said he is
<zwabbit> try to keep who says what straight
<Alex_Ionescu> learn to read
<Alex_Ionescu> or i'll have Allah smite you
<zwabbit> and considering alex is responsible for a significant portion
of the kernel
<zwabbit> i have reason to tolerate him
<Guest39028> An atheist equates himself the equal of God claiming that
God doesn't really exist.
<hyoenmadan> Guest39028: this is a channel to talk about those
questions?
<zwabbit> oh, another issue
<zwabbit> you don't seem to ever actually read people's responses to
your posts
<Guest39028> I've tried that before hyoenmadan, but there are no
transcripts so you can't see that.
<smiley1_> Guest39028: when did he say he is an atheist ?!?
* ubuntuRE (~ubuntu at host195-0-dynamic.59-82-r.retail.telecomitalia.it)
has joined #reactos
<zwabbit> for all your talk about "discussion," one can't exist if the
other side doesn't listen
<Alex_Ionescu> If god wouldn't exist?where did I come from?
<Alex_Ionescu> You seem confused
<Alex_Ionescu> Are you denying the awesomeness of my dad?
<Guest39028> If God does exist Alex, why do you equate yourself to be
his equal and thus incapable of taking his name in vain by saying OMG as
if whatever you are talking about is His fault?
<ThFabba> That's not even a sentence.
<Alex_Ionescu> I'm not his equal, I'm his son
<ubuntuRE> guys, I think you are tremendously OT
<ThFabba> ubuntuRE: well spotted :)
<hyoenmadan> here we go again...
<Alex_Ionescu> ubuntuRE: exactly. i tried to make the channel OT with
singing, ponies, nothing worked..at least religion worked
<smiley1_> ubuntuRE: but we are having fun :(
<ubuntuRE> I guess: how is possible to discuss about something is not
sure that exists?
<Alex_Ionescu> hyoenmadan: go to 4chan.org for a bit, and come back here
after
<CIA-71> ReactOS: cmihail shell32_new-bringup *
r53629 /dll/win32/shell32/ (5 files): 
<CIA-71> ReactOS: [shell32.dll]
<CIA-71> ReactOS: - More uninitialized value fixing. Again Amine Khaldi
spotting them with his magical powers.
<CIA-71> ReactOS: - I took the liberty to convert tabs I found to
spaces. Normally I shouldn't mix formatting with coding changes but I
forgot. Sorry.
<hyoenmadan> lol
<Alex_Ionescu> if that doesn't work...
<Alex_Ionescu> go on Encylpoedia Dramatica
<Alex_Ionescu> and go on the wiki for
<Alex_Ionescu> "Offended"
<ubuntuRE> Alex_Ionescu, I prefere you when code
<hyoenmadan> i would care about that idiotic sites???
<Alex_Ionescu> ubuntuRE: and i prefer you when you're not home, but your
mom is
<hyoenmadan> alex
<ubuntuRE> Alex_Ionescu, pentru tine?
<smiley1_> ubuntuRE: have you seen Alex_Ionescu's commit logs ? :D
<hyoenmadan> ReactOS channel is to discuss about ReactOS and related
topics
<ubuntuRE> smiley1_, never now that i think.
<Guest39028> Well, Alex really should drop OMG from his vocabulary or
does he really believe that something is God's fault?
<Alex_Ionescu> I'd be willing to use OMFG
<Alex_Ionescu> If that works better
<ThFabba> Oh your God!
<Guest39028> That is worse than OMG, assuming the F means fuck.
<Alex_Ionescu> Look man, me and my buddy JC don't have to take advice
from you on how to call our dada
<Guest39028> I'm asking you to be sensible Alex, OMG and OMFG are not
sensible things to say.
<Alex_Ionescu> Remember what happened to your great-uncle in Sodom?
<Alex_Ionescu> We wouldn't that to happen again now would we
<ubuntuRE> Alex_Ionescu, it seems you are looking for fighting on
channe, flame and other bad things... in this case it is enough you ask
for, so simple.
<Guest39028> If my great uncle died in Sodom, I probably wouldn't exist.
<Alex_Ionescu> ubuntuRE: I was just sick of the whining about the forums
and who was right
<Guest39028> You can't whine on IRC.
<ubuntuRE> whining? what does it means?
<Alex_Ionescu> Arguing about "OMG" is much more productive
<Alex_Ionescu> ubuntuRE: it's the noise a baby makes when he peed
himself
* zwabbit is amazed you guys are letting him string you along this long
<ubuntuRE> ah ok
<ubuntuRE> what about GSOC results?
* zwabbit points to newsletter
<Alex_Ionescu> i'm getting bored :S let's talk about..abortion?
<Guest39028> Apparently if you complain that you are discriminated
against in this community, you are wrong.
<ubuntuRE> yes, i read it i was guessing if forter code of GSOC was
integrated in trunk.
<Alex_Ionescu> gun control?
<zwabbit> forter code?
<Alex_Ionescu> affirmative action?
<ubuntuRE> Alex_Ionescu, maybe suca de pula?
<zwabbit> Guest39028: oh, no, you're not wrong, you are definitely being
discriminated against, because you've managed to piss off basically all
of the regulars in the community
<Guest39028> Where does a coder for ReactOS get off trying to get
controversial topic discussion going?
* JimProfit has quit (Quit: Nettalk6 - www.ntalk.de)
<Alex_Ionescu> ubuntuRE: Sugar of cock? Tell me more
<zwabbit> we've reached the point where we genuinely do not want your
participation
<zwabbit> that you keep coming back is quite frankly surprising to us
<Alex_Ionescu> zwabbit: i want his participation!
<Guest39028> I want my account fixed now.
<ubuntuRE> Alex_Ionescu, i supposed you are romanian, so i speack to you
in romanian
<zwabbit> there's nothing to fix
<zwabbit> you got banned
<Alex_Ionescu> ubuntuRE: You did, in fact! You said "Sugar of cock"
<Guest39028> Un ban me.
<zwabbit> no
<Alex_Ionescu> Guest39028: Say OMG and I'll un ban you.
<Alex_Ionescu> I promise
<Guest39028> Okay Z89, so much for giving me a chance.
* zwabbit was not aware alex still had amin access
<zwabbit> you were given a chance
<Guest39028> No I wasn't.
<Alex_Ionescu> zwabbit: Higher than admin
<zwabbit> you got banned after getting the chance
<ubuntuRE> i supposed suca=suck, im fromg?
<Guest39028> For what you coward???
<ubuntuRE> wrong?
<Alex_Ionescu> unC0Rr: yep
<Alex_Ionescu> err
<Alex_Ionescu> ubuntuRE*
<Alex_Ionescu> Guest39028: say OMG and I'll un ban you
<zwabbit> for repeating the same actions that got you banned in the
first place
<Guest39028> No, what did I get banned for Z89, stop dodging the
question.
<ubuntuRE> so ,. how to say "tu suck" in romanian language?
<Alex_Ionescu> or Ya Allah
<zwabbit> and considering that in these two incidents, it was two
different people who decided that your tone, posts, etc were framed to
antagonize the community
<KlausM> ubuntuRE, careful with romanian swearing
<KlausM> I'm senssitive about that ;)
<Alex_Ionescu> or?"oh my Yahweh"
<Guest39028> You're still dodging the question.
<Alex_Ionescu> i'll accept any of the tree
<Alex_Ionescu> three*
<ubuntuRE> KlausM, i ask to ve sure what ask when back in cluj napoca
<Alex_Ionescu> ubuntuRE: "suge"
<ubuntuRE> or jasi
<zwabbit> your post that apparently caused daniel to ban you: Sure,
ignore the more serious question of how can you ask someone if they are
Catholic on ReactOS IRC chat and pressure them even further by asking
where they live, where they go to school, etcetera when they clearly
don't want to answer those questions. If the ReactOS Foundation is not
responsible for the content of the ReactOS IRC...
<ubuntuRE> ahhhhhhhhhh suge ok tnx
<zwabbit> ...channel, who is responsible? First rule of leadership is,
the buck stops with the leader. You are responsible for the conduct of
people you allow onto your forums. It is bad PR to hide from problems
that crop up by saying, "we aren't responsible, it's not our problem, or
nothing wrong happened." That never works for politicians, why should it
work for the ReactOS community?
<Alex_Ionescu> zwabbit stop being serious
<ubuntuRE> guys, why not bat to ROS topics?
<Alex_Ionescu> tell him to say OMG, Ya Allah, or Oh My Yahweh
<zwabbit> your previous post: Too bad this will generate bad PR for
ReactOS. Explain how asking someone if they are Catholic on IRC chat for
ReactOS is appropriate? Explain how going further and asking where do
you go to school is germane. Blatant harassment is harassment no matter
who is dishing it out. Criticizing a religion on IRC chat for ReactOS is
indefensible conduct and here you are defending...
<Alex_Ionescu> and unban him
<ubuntuRE> back*
<zwabbit> ...it. I would sue the ReactOS Foundation for the harassment
to effect some change, but I can't afford to and you can't squeeze blood
out of a vegetable. If I were you Z98, for the sake of the project, I

Subject: [PLUG] Windows or stick with Linux compatible...
Message-ID: <1315434745.2547.54.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

hardware and software?

There is a thread about a USB printer not working right under Linux and
other hardware threads pop up now and then.  What tools are available to
improve this situation long term?  Some people say ReactOS is the
answer, but as my transcript from ReactOS IRC shows, that is a very
nasty community.  ReactOS is over 12 years old and still way behind.
They are pursuing a moving target where they may have to make a bad
decision now and then to remain compatible.  Syllable on the other hand
is younger where there is no moving target per se and hey, Syllable
server is based on Linux.  I've played around with Syllable under
VirtualBox and I have to say that it is impressive.

If fewer people decide that they want Windows, there will be less of a
need for a Windows clone.  Software companies who don't support Linux,
Syllable, Freedos, etcetera will lose.  I think the best bet with a
hardware device that won't work in Linux is to recycle it and replace
with something that will.

I would like to see some sanction imposed on the current ReactOS
developers to bring them back down to the Earth.  Barring that, I
would like to see a new community form with it's own web site and
a different non profit foundation supporting it.  There used to be more
than one attempt to make a free Windows clone, but the ReactOS project
is the only one that exists today.  Why is that?

Some people claim that 3d video acceleration is a problem in Linux and
that Linux is slower than Windows.  Well, maybe some cards from AMD
don't accelerate easily, but NVIDIA's offerings seem to be a different
story.  I have an Athlon 635 quad core system where the Radeon HD5450
has been taken out because it doesn't work well in Fedora 15.  I'm
looking for a replacement video card.

One of the beauties of Linux, there is more than one source.  With
ReactOS, there is only one source and in my case this isn't a friendly
source.  The ReactOS community currently enjoys a monopoly over the
category of open source Windows NT clone.  Maybe this should be
rectified.

You knew this wasn't appropriate for PLUG when you posted it, thus the

If you want to develop ReactOS, no one is stopping you if that's
*your* itch. But it's not related to Linux.

Take it over there. As a Linux user I don't care. However it is
*their* project and appealing for people to hack their servers is
objectionable.

I NEVER advocated for anyone to hack their servers.  I would like to see
them taken down for a while by the proper legal authorities though.  I
can't complain on their forums, I am being threatened with imprisonment
if I ever get on the ReactOS forums or ReactOS IRC chat again.  I don't
know German law, so I don't know how realistic the threats are.

This is not completely off topic because Linux is essentially OSS
software and thus could, but hasn't fortunately, succumb to the same
kinds of issues.  Fortunately in the Linux world, there are hundreds of
distributions and even more user groups.

This is OT, but it is also germane because this is a functional open
source software community where the ReactOS community is not.  I'm only
advocating for someone to download the source and form a new group to
develop it further that is completely detached from the original.  Just
because one person is disinterested doesn't mean that everyone is.

Message-ID: <1315460376.6472.30.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

stamp in the email headers?

I'm trying to set up amavis, spamassassin, and clamav.

Before I set these three things up, incoming email had an
X-Originating-IP header line.  I've been using that line thinking that
my Postfix server was appending it with the IP address of the connecting
server.

Looking at the email headers now, the last received from line is the
local IP address of my relay which is useless.  Somewhere down the line,
there is a foreign IP address.  Knowing what was added by my postfix
server though verses what was added by say the spam bot is very
important.

I want amavis or postfix before amavis engages to stamp the IP address
of the remote server and the time it connected.

This doesn't appear to be happening anymore.  Help!

First, I forgot that I started this thread and today tried to send a
message starting a new thread. But, strangely, the pdx.edu mail server
couldn't deliver the message. Oh well.

It is now later and I have time to deal with the switch issue. I am not
good at fixing things. Plus, even if I fix it, how long will it last
before dying on me again? I'd rather give it away and get a new one.

But that means shopping, and all I know is that I want one that is 24
ports, gigabit rated, and manufactured by someone that has a good
reputation for reliability. Google found me 24-port gigabit switches
for as little as $115, but I don't know about the quality.

Does anyone have recommendations for brands and/or models that are
reliable?

I have a Netgear GS116 16-port gigabit switch, although I really always
wanted a 24-port. The Netgear died recently* and I needed a replacement
toot sweet on a weekend, so I got an 8-port Dynex at Best Buy, just to
get me running again. However, once every couple of weeks I discover
that a printer is not connected and I have to go shuffle cables because
8 ports is not enough. So now I am shopping for a 24-port gigabit switch
that will not die a few months after the warranty is up. 

*It is up for grabs if someone wants to spend the time to fix it.

So what is a good brand for reliability? Any particular models that
people like?

Subject: [PLUG] pdxlinux.org and blacklisting everydns.net
Message-ID: <20110908092059.GA28472@gate.kl-ic.com>

I hope this makes it out.  Service has been spotty over the
last few hours.

pdxlinux.org is hosted on Wil Cooley's server, nakedape.cc ,
and nameservice is via ns1.nakedape.cc .  Nameservers for
ns1.nakedape.cc include ns1.everydns.net through ns5.everydns.net .

dyn.com somehow acquired everydns.net, and is discontinuing it,
encouraging users of this free dns service to migrate to dyn.com
for the low low price of $5, aka more than free.  And they are
encouraging the migration by rerouting dns to a nag page telling
people to move.  This happened earlier this evening when I was
trying to get to the pdxlinux.org website, and may be screwing
up your postings to the list.

Intentionally poisoning DNS, and terminating DNS early because
a company doesn't feel like honoring commitments of a hosting
service they bought out, is heinous.  I expect I will migrate 
my dozen domains away from dyn.com, unless I hear about the
firing of the dipsh*ts who thought this was a good idea.  There
are plenty of unemployed honest people to take their place.

Meanwhile, dyn.com is in the midst of poisoning everydns.net. 
We should block that URL with our own dns servers.  That may
affect other sites we use, besides pdxlinux.org .

So, the question:

What is the easiest robust way to block a domain by url with
dns?  Is there a way to do so on a linux firewall machine,
so I do not have to do it for every machine behind it?

The easiest and most robust way is to add a DNS zone for dyn.com to your DNS
server. This will cause it to be unable to serve any DNS records for that
domain.

If you want to do this at a firewall level, the easiest way is to add routes
for the IP block belonging to dyn.com, pointing them to someplace useless,
like the loopback interface, or NULL if that is supported by your route
command.

I am not a lawyer, and I am not an expert on American or German law.

However, since you posted it on a list of people who know how to hack
from Linux, the implication IMO is clear. I suspect a lawyer could use
your words to incriminate us. I therefore echo Robert's objections.

In that case, I suggest that you hire someone who is an expert on German

Actions speak louder than words. Kindness gets a better reaction than
vinegar. If you start such a community, and start showing more kindness
to others here on this list, then I might listen further.

Michael,

I think it is pretty clear that the majority of us *do not care* about
the ReactOS community, the software, or your interactions with them on
IRC.  For those on the PLUG list who do care, I'm sure you can have
good discussions with them on various ReactOS forums, mailing lists,
and alternative IRC channels.  I know you are probably quite
frustrated with the ReactOS community, but this is not the right place
to vent that frustration.

I was wondering whatever happened to this thread.  :)

If it is a case of poor quality capacitors the repair should last for
years. The caps are about the only parts that aren't SMT in the
switches I've looked at, so are simple to replace if you have any
soldering skills at all.

Email me offlist if you'd like to discuss options for getting some of
the caps and/or trying to fix it. I still have quite a few of the
caps.

Here's a thought -- have a FixMyNetgearCaps event with the DorkbotPDX
folks at one of their meetings downtown, which were on Mondays last
time I checked.

NealS

I'd be happy to.  And then I'd give it back.  I already have an 8-port GB
switch that I don't really use.

Roughly, there's:
* Enterprise-grade kit (Cisco Catalyst series, HP Procurve series) that
  gets used for billable services - runs for years at a time.
* Second tier stuff (Linksys, Netgear, D-Link) that might be rebadged
  no-name gear - if downtime matters, buy a spare.
* No-name gear (Dynex, Lucky Double Pigeon Brand) - treat as a fire hazard.

Those are good thoughts and suggestions, but I have always wanted a
24-port switch so I don't ever have to fiddle with cables.

But if someone wants the Netgear, it's free to whoever wants to take
the time to fix it.

I've had good luck, at work and home with SMC switches (I think they are now
owned by LG-Ericsson)... they are reasonably affordable (for what you get...
but are probably more expensive than D-Link/Linksys/Netgear/etc.), fairly
sturdily built (if you buy the metal-cased ones), and have been reliable for
me (many SMC's come with a lifetime warranty). They might be a little harder
to find (especially locally), but are available online at many places (CDW,
to name just one place - not necessarily the best).

>From the sounds of it, the SMCGS24 is the one you
want:<http://www.smc.com/index.cfm?event=viewProduct&localeCode=EN_USA&cid=7&scid=39&pid=1414>
goo.gl/mf0LA - Item on SMC's website
goo.gl/EVntD - Item for sale at CDW's website ($220)

They, of course, have higher-end models with more features (PoE, VLANs, QoS,
etc.) - but those sound like they'd be overkill for you. I THINK this is one
of the SMC switches that has a lifetime warranty (it does according to CDW's
website).

As a VERY rough indicator (regardless of brand), I usually look for a switch
that has an internal power supply (no wall-wart/external power supply) - it
just uses a standard computer power cable... this TENDS to imply a certain
level of quality (again, YMMV). I would classify these devices as being near
Aaron's "Enterprise" equipment - but maybe a little more accessible that
most 3com/ProCurve type equipment that generally come with a lot more
features (at a much higher cost).

Anyhow... that's my $0.02... YMMV, FWIW, HTH, and all the other usual
acronyms.

I do see that the header list the email of the sender as "From:", so in 
my email client a simple filter could be applied to move all incoming 
email from a particular user to Trash, automatically.
In my client, while reading the message: Navigate: Message -> Create 
Filter From Message, and the rest is pretty easy to follow
(Client: Seamonkey ... your mileage may vary).
Does that help?

Nice thing about these is that the defaults on these work for our
environment without
changes.  We just have to add some ACL's to drop certain types of traffic.

I done this already.  In fact its been in place for quite awhile but 
when someone replies to his messages it gets through.

Going to have to tune up my mail sieve foo so I can filter the body of 
the messages.

I almost bought this Trendnet switch when Newegg had it on sale for $90.
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833156294

I know nothing about Trendnet reliability, but one of the Newegg
reviewers says that this switch does not have a fan.  While that might
make it less reliable, it also makes it more tolerable in a home
environment.  I think many switches of the type you are considering
are likely to have a fan, potentially a noisy one due to the form factor.

Good point about the fans, Galen.

FWIW, I THINK that the SMC I recommended also does NOT have a fan (although,
I may be thinking of the 16-port version).

The lack of a fan could be an issue (theoretically) if in a warm/hot
environment... but, again - not in my experience. Believe it or not, I work
in a formal IT dept. that has no A/C... it's currently 87 degrees at my desk
as I am writing this... and very few of my network closets have A/C either.
These SMC switches get used in a variety of rooms/areas around here - some
that get very warm (like my office) - and I've still had very good luck with
them over the past few years.

   Nice to know I'm not the only one without air conditioning. It's 82F now.

   The heat has not been an issue with the computers (I turn on a large box
fan for the electronics, me, and the dogs). However, a couple of days ago I
tried -- twice -- to build the TeXLive SlackBuild package. One source file
is 1.2G compressed, it requires about 5G of temporary disk space, and the
build is so intense it shut down the system because the CPU was overheating
in both attempts. Learning my lesson, I waited until 6:00am the next
morning, when the air temperature outside was 54F (and the windows here were
open) and it built without a problem. This was a first for me.

That is why I mentioned the Seamonkey client (hoping other clients can 
do similar things) ... picking from column A and column B, inserting the 
regex to match ... add one or more of these filter criteria, and set to 
match all, or any, or to match all messages ... then select the action 
to be taken.

I don't do anything fancy with it, but it looks pretty useful to me.  
Hope this helps

Has anyone else noticed this, or is it just my system?  I am running a 
64 bit version of Ubuntu 10.04 lucid edition of linux.  While using the 
recursive grep command on the /usr folder, I noticed a lot of "No such 
file or directory" messages.

Investigating further, I found over 10,530 such messages when searching 
the whole /usr folder and all of these pertained to symbolic links that 
pointed to missing files (most generally)

I also saw this on the latest 11.10 oneiric edition of Ubuntu also, in 
the /usr area.

Does anyone actually check out their symbolic links?  Or do we just 
assume that if we make a symbolic link, it is good to go?

Of course, I am afraid to touch anything, but still 10,540+ messages 
seems a lot?

Your thoughts?

I'm threatened with a lawsuit by an open source project
moderator/developer and mostly what I get posting the threat on this
list is discussion about how to censor me.  Never mind that my questions
about Postfix, Asterisk, and overscan correction are getting ignored.

What is with people who are censoring what I say about ReactOS?  I
certainly won't go to the ReactOS forums because I am being threatened
there.  I thought an open source community that functions would be a
reasonable forum to discuss one that doesn't.  I guess I was wrong.

There are people here, you know who you are, who are behaving no better
than those in the ReactOS community who are threatening me.

Michael,

I am interested in many things computer, so please hear this from 
someone who doesn't have a dog in the fight.

This is PLUG (Portland Linux Users Group), not POSUG (Portland Open 
Source Users Group).

This list is for Linux related topics.  Please note the period at the 
end of the sentence.

You have been asked by moderators higher than me many times
to back off of anything ReactOS related on this site.

No one here has ever wanted to talk to you about ReactOS, so I don't see 
why you would think
that someone has magically shown up who does.

When people continue to receive email regarding topics that they have 
opted out of, the natural
and really only option is to blacklist that content/mailer, why would 
you expect otherwise?

Please keep this in mind.  If anyone here wants to talk about ReactOS, 
they will join those forums.

Thank you,

-Bill Ensley

I am trying to get people to care about a very real threat I am
receiving.  I am NOT a troll.  I post the actual threat and all I get is
censorship?  What about my questions concerning Asterisk and my
questions concerning other Linux related topics?  The censorship means
that I'm going to get ignored on everything.  Is this how you want to be
treated?  Do you want to be called a troll?  I learned to treat others
the way I want to be treated, I guess you didn't Heinlein.

Do I post real spam to the plug list?  Do I post messages asking you to
buy this or buy that?  Do I send messages saying that I'm horny and
looking for someone else who is?  No.  I get those kinds of messages
though as well as Nigerian scam email where my Postfix questions need to
be answered for me to have any hope of blocking it.  I maintain my own
Linux based web site, Asterisk server, etcetera.  Guess if I get ignored
by everyone that I'll have to carry on by myself without any help from
anyone locally.

I just discovered that my Netgear GS116 has a lifetime warranty. Or so
Netgear's website leads me to believe.

I do want a 24-port switch, and because of my experience with the
Netgear I had figured "any brand but Netgear." I may have to rethink
that reasoning.

Meantime, the Trendnet and SMC switches that have been suggested have
only a one-year warranty. In fact, looking on Newegg and Dell is where
I discovered that Netgear offers a lifetime warranty, which is hard to
find in anything else short of $1,000+ units.

I'll call Netgear tomorrow and see what they say.

Same here, on my 64 bit natty... ranging from broken alternatives, to
broken symlinks for language packs. Gnome has a rather impressive
amount of them.

I don't write poorly, it's easy enough to use evolution's spell checker
and I'm pretty decent at spelling anyways.  As far as grammar, nobody is
perfect.

Define arcane, I try my best to write clear questions.

How do you know I haven't tried to find the answer first on my own?

I'm not abusive and it is disingenuous to take what I write as an
insult.

What mean things do I say about other people?  I tried to point out
difficulties I'm having with another open source community, and people
started attacking me for that.  I have facts to back up what I'm saying.
I don't take lightly criticizing another open source community.

What does you don't act as a plug member mean?  That is a vague
accusation.

I never try to help others?  Maybe I don't have the answer they need
where making something up is far worse than not saying anything at all.

Short of me uploading a music file that is a recording of me whining, it
isn't possible to whine in an email.  Furthermore, calling an excerpt of
what someone actually wrote drama isn't accurate.  Life is dramatic
sometimes and you can say, "sorry that's dramatic go away," or you can
take a look and see if there is some way you can help.

As far as they exist because God put them there, are you saying that we
don't necessarily have a purpose?  I'd say we all have a purpose and
that part of life is asking questions to try to discover and fulfill
that purpose.

As far as saying that I view the people on this list as slaves, that is
an objective judgment call you are making and nothing more.  I don't.
Furthermore, some questions should be asked even though Google can
generate some kind of answer because Google isn't always right.  There
is a lot of misinformation on the Net and a lot of just old information
that gets in the way.  Linux is not static after all and probably nobody
can completely catch up.

What is a Linux mailing list worth if nobody asks questions for fear
they will be branded the questioner and asked to leave?  People who are
knowledgeable are hopefully happy to answer questions, especially well
asked ones.  I attempt to ask reasonable questions, how impolite for
someone to suggest otherwise.

This may or may not help but ... I don't think that's the most current 
driver for that card. I installed the driver for that same card on a 
Fedora 14 box the other day but the one I used was 
NVIDIA-Linux-x86-280.13.run. In checking, that is the one nvidia has on 
their website also. You might try upgrading your driver and see if that 
helps anything.

Everyone,

This IS off topic, and you should delete it now. :)

Michael,

I have tried before, and I am probably beating a dead horse with this post. But I am going to try to explain to you why we, collectively, find your posts annoying. This is all my opinion, but I believe most of what I am about to say is pretty close to what others feel, based on what others have said.

Is the threat linux? No, it's not. It's a threat of civil action in court, which is off topic.

>  I am NOT a troll.

By strict definition, you are a troll. You post off topic and inflammatory messages in an online forum. That is exactly the definition of a troll. The message I am replying to is a prime example of an inflammatory message.

You yourself said the message was off topic, then claimed it was on topic because it had to do with open source software. Claiming something is on topic does not make it so. 

>  I post the actual threat and all I get is
> censorship?

Someone here did actually tell you what you can do about the threat. Other than that suggestion, there is nothing anyone in this forum can do for you. Contact a lawyer. That is your only recourse. If someone does not want you in their forum, they are entitled to ban you from it. If they bring a suit against you, we can't help you. Only an attorney can.

That's the unfortunate thing about pissing in the pool. If you generate enough animosity that enough people filter your posts, then you will not get the help you ask for. That's also one of the great strengths of this type of group. Most people self police themselves well enough.

I suggest you look in the mirror. If your actions are leading to people filtering your posts, and more than a handful are doing it, maybe you need to reflect on what YOU are doing. We all live here, and you are not any more special than anyone else. Freedom of speech does not mean we have to listen to you. We can refuse to listen to you, and it appears that many here have decided to do just that. You do NOT treat people the way you want to be treated. You expect us to all jump on your bandwagon and rally around you concerning your latest crisis.

You know as well as everyone else that plug-talk is for non-linux/unix related posts. If you are not asking for help regarding the use and/or operation of a linux or unix operating system, then your post does not belong here. Legal issues do not belong here.

That is a large amount. I too have about ~13k in /usr with 11.04. (Using 
my favorite command, find:find /usr -xtype l) .

It looks like almost all of them are in /usr/share/, and a very large 
number are related to language packs. For whatever reason, it seems 
popular for a package to install the symlink, and then to only install 
the resolved file with the language pack itself. (For example, 
language-pack-gnome-it for Italian.) I wonder what is the value in this 
arrangement?

Best,
Jameson

My GS116 switch just died 5-days ago, altho I had a similar Netgear 
giga switch die about 6-months ago. Not to mention the power supply 
to my Infrant-Netgear NV+ file server going up in smoke about 2-months ago.

Netgear does a great job of making it hard to use there warranty, but 
eventually come thru. First you should make sure your device is 
registered at there website. Then you need to call they're hard to 
find phone number 888-638-4327 (use extension #4 for tech support.) 
You'll get an operator who will give you a case number then put you 
into a queue to talk to an support engineer. Recently when I got to 
this stage they're hold system timed out after 15 minutes and put me 
into voice mail where I left my number and email. After 4-days of no 
response I had to call again, this time a was able to describe the 
problem to an engineer, after following the previous process. The 
engineer approved my failure and but me on hold to speak to the RMA 
specialist who after verifying serial number, name and address, case 
number etc again and another on hold period, gave me the RMA number. 
He waited on the line while I confirmed the confirming email he sent 
me and the I got to select one of three RMA programs, from free 
(after I send back the unit with the specified documentation to a 
next day air delivery of a replacement unit and pre-paid return for 
about $50. Since I had already replace the unit with a Trendnet 
TEG-160WS smart switch in the intervening time, I went with the 
cheapest approach for about $12.

A similar winding path to replacement was experience with Netgear on 
the fired power supply with the NV+ except I paid the big bucks for 
the next day air. I've notice that a lot of warranties, including the 
lifetime GS116 don't include the power supply, which under normal 
condition it the most like part to die, altho a well designed unit 
should last more than ten years. Cheap capacitors from China seem to 
have cut that lifetime to less than half. Hopefully cap quality will 
increase with manufacturing experience and buyer demand.

Good Luck

Thanks for that information. It prepared me for the trials of dealing
with Netgear.

Unfortunately, I did not register the switch and I do not have the
receipt, although I bought it at Fry's and I have them looking it up as
I write this. I tried to point out to the lady at Netgear that if the
warranty is lifetime the exact date of purchase is irrelevant, but she
failed to grasp my logic. It may take Fry's up to 48 hours to track
down the sale. As soon as they respond I will register and get an RMA.
The Netgear lady said the cheapest shipping option is 19.90.

I've  never tried it.  But I did install calibre (available in your

books. Much simpler than trying to read them in a browser.

While I don't have any direct experience with the software, I have a 
cousin in MI that uses it on a MS based laptop.  I asked her about it 
because I saw that it also works on Linux ... her response was all very 
positive ... easy to read (can adjust brightness, she said), and easy to 
use (she is a fairy competent computer user, but wouldn't qualify as a 
techie ... she seeks help on tech stuff).  Contact me off line if you 
like, with any specific questions you may like me to ask her.

My own feeling was that it might be OK assuming they had the title you 
wanted.  I was burned by O'Reilly Safari bookshelf a few years back ... 
they started removing books from my self (all very legal and at the 
request of the author, they said) without any warning at all.  And there 
was not any way for me to cancel and get any of my advance payments 
back.  Maybe O'Reilly has improved, and maybe Amazon won't do anything 
like that ... your needs and mileage may vary.

My cousin reads mostly mysteries ... she is into one series right now 
that combines cookbooks with murder mysteries.

Hope this helps

Fred James

Hello all,

Our IPv6 speaker will be unavailable for the PLUG Advanced slot this 
month and I'd like to have a roundtable about modern web serving:

The CGI era gave way to LAMP and we're now onto the next generation:

- node.js and NoSQL make LAMP overkill for many situations

I saw this just after posting a PLUG AT meeting announcement about web 
serving... which could theoretically get into non-FLOSS technologies!

Shall I pull it? I just learned of Ted's unavailability and consider it 
too late for another speaker.

Should I pull the proposed topic for being too off-topic for PLUG?

I trust it to be implied that I am discussing serving in a POSIX 
Linux/BSD environment but it's borderline none the less.

And what of networking topics? Where would the community prefer David 
and I draw the line?

Some have pointed out that the DevOps meeting might be more appropriate 
for these. I really should attend one...

Are people okay with "PLUG meetings feature the interesting speakers 
that David and Michael can find"?

Does anyone want to join in the speaker hunt to help keep things on-topic?

I don't think anyone is advocating changing anything with the meetings, although I myself have only been to one? 

I think we can all agree that while defining what is off topic can be difficult, most of us know it when we see it.

Michael,

Don't pull any speakers.
I don't really think anyone is advocating any changes from the current
system where we
occasionally have speakers on non-Linux, non-Unix Open Source related topics.
Indeed, this may become even more frequent in the future as Linux and
the BSDs and
other Unix OSs become more ubiquitous and are simply taken for granted.

Agreed.

This actually applies to meetings to: any organizer must screen 
presentations for sales pitches but fortunately sales pitches can have 
great technical information. It's a fine line and exactly like you said, 
you know it when you see it.

Subject: [PLUG] Asterisk, Fax, Faxmodem
Message-ID: <20110913181118.GC10205@gate.kl-ic.com>

My wife's new office will have 3 incoming PSTN voice lines and a
fax line, terminating on a home-brew Asterisk PBX.  These will
be existing phone numbers from her old office, with hunt-group
rollover, so we won't be moving those to VOIP for a while.  Over
time, we expect to replace most fax traffic with emailed PDFs. 

I assume that rather than try to teach Asterisk and codecs
to handle the fax line, it will be easier to use a $20 PCI
fax/modem card (suggestions?), while using three FXO ports
for the incoming PSTN voice lines.

Is this plausible?

Subject: [PLUG] Determining Memory Chip Speed
Message-ID: <4E6FA3D3.20201@comcast.net>

I used "sudo dmidecode --type memory" to try to learn the speed of my 
currently installed memory. (I'm thinking of adding some.) I find that I 
have two 512 MB modules installed out of a possible 3 modules.

dmidecode says "Current Speed: Unknown" for both of those.

Is there some other way -- short of taking the cover off the box -- to 
find out what speed the chips are?

Second question: Can I add a 1 GB module to the third socket or do I 
need to replace the two 512 MB modules with 1 GB modules to get to 2 GB?

Thanks.

Hi Keith,

This is a similar setup to what we have.

4 incoming lines into a 4 port FXO home brew asterisk box.

1 incoming fax line going to a PCI fax modem hooked up to HylaFax which
then is configured to email a PDF of the completed fax to us.

I have however setup Asterisk to listen for a fax on a line and it is 
not very difficult.

So you could do with just the Asterisk solution if you want, just get a 
4 port FXO
and use 3 for phone, 1 for fax.

Your BIOS ought to be able to give you that information.  At
least, the ones I've used have.  (I admit that my sample size
isn't very big.  One Tyan board and several ASUS boxen.)  Another
possibility is the lshw program.  At least with lshw you won't
need to reboot.  :-)

There you'll have to check your motherboard's documentation.

I just had a problem the other day where someone wanted a PDF emailed. It had information on it I consider private and PDFs (usually) are not encrypted. Am I missing something, or being overly paranoid?

Russell,

No, you are not being paranoid, but we do have to accept that PDFs are 
not going anywhere (and you can encrypt if you desire)

As a printshop with a full PDF workflow, we open hundreds of files daily 
and see this constantly.

Worse though, are the Excel mailing lists send to us for addressing.

These usually come from a Title company or mortgage company and have an 
intense amount of
private information including loan amounts, income, etc.

The true solution would be to make the sender responsible for securing 
information sent, not the
receiver who has little control.

My $0.02.

I solved my issue by hooking a phone line up to my fax printer and sending directly. I didn't want to confuse the receiver by encrypting and sending a password. Even then, I didn't have a secure way to give them a password...

When I run dmidecode I get speeds for my modules, showing as DMI type 17 
(also as type 6, showing current speed in ns). Just a guess, perhaps the 
sticks or the MB don't support speed reports.

Well, leading to the second question, if you're gonna crack the case and 
add RAM, may as well do it now to see what they are. If they're OE 
installed then they probably are the same speed as the MB can handle; 
check online for system specs (You'd want to meet those specs anyway 
when buying RAM).

My HP came with 2x512 @ 533MHz. I added 2x1024 @ 533 (at the time I 
couldn't afford 4 sticks). If you can afford it, make all the sticks 
identical in size and speed. I seem to recall something about a 
performance hit using different sized modules, but I can't back that up. 
Different speeds means the slowest will set the standard.

I ran lshw yesterday while looking for what kind of memory I have, so I 
already have the motherboard info:

MSI MS-6380E

I remember putting one of them in myself several years ago when 
upgrading to a whole gig was a big deal.

According to the CNET review, the motherboard supports 333 MHz, 200 MHz,

Economy is required. Hence, I'm trying to keep what I have and just add 
another gig.

That would be useful to know since performance is something I'm trying 
to improve.

I assumed there would be some gotcha if they were mixed. I thought they 
might not work together at all.

As mentioned above, I've tried that.

Now that you mention it, I think I still have the motherboard box, and 
the docs. I'll have to dig those out.

See above.

Thanks for all the ideas. I'll do some more digging and see what I find.

According to crucial.com your motherboard supports:

Memory Type: DDR PC3200, DDR PC2700, DDR (ECC)
Maximum Memory: 3GB 
Slots: 3
Each memory slot can hold DDR PC3200, DDR PC2700 with a maximum of 1GB per slot.

As far as price, it doesn't matter wether you buy PC3200 or PC2700 non-ECC memory. It's the same price.

I've noticed that in the price shopping I've been doing. I'll try 
rebooting and dropping into the bios to see if there's anything to see 
there. Otherwise, I'll shut down and open up the case.

Be aware that the PC2700 can be faster than the PC3200. If you're
running at PC2700 speed and the PC2700 is CL2.5 while the PC3200 is
CL3, there will be a performance hit with the PC3200.

Also, the speed of the other modules will effect maximum memory speed.
I haven't played around with three module configurations but making
sure the two 512MB modules are interleaved may help a bit, depending
on the sophistication of the chipset, the BIOS, phase of the moon,
etc.

Burn a boot disk with Memtest86+ and play musical DIMMs to see what works best.

http://www.memtest.org/ or many Linux install disks offer it as a boot option.

I am thinking with a system this mature.  RAM speed is not going to do much
either way.

Did you mention CPU speed?

Bill - 
Thanks for changing the subject line.

Russ -

The PDFs in this case (patient charts!) will be "emailed" from
machine A to machine B within the same locked cage, in a locked
office, over an openVPN tunnel, a bit of extra paranoia in case
somebody taps the ethernet hardware (inside the cage) somehow.

The other bit of paranoia is backups, which will be rsync
(actually dirvish using rsync) using SSH, inside an openVPN tunnel.

The big gaping hole is probably Tempest - if somebody can 
read the EMF off a flat screen.  Seems unlikely, but ...

It is good that you are asking this question.  This will be
medical information, and part of Obamacare was staffing up
the enforcement arm of HIPPA.  Doctors are starting to pay
huge fines and may be soon going to prison because they did
not get their IT security right.  Their staff and IT
contractors may also be vulnerable.

Since nobody encrypts the email they send to doctors, or can
read encrypted email from them, any electronic doctor-patient
communication (beyond appointment reminders) will probably
have to be via https "web page emails", with those
postage-stamp-sized text boxes.  Fooey.

Phone lines?  Too easily tapped.  And those conversations 
are turned into "digital records" as they pass through the
PSTN, so some idiot judge may extend HIPPA to the phone
system.

We are already faced with designing the new office so
patients in the waiting room can't hear anybody on the
phone, and vice versa.  We also had to reject one space
because we could not control access through the office
for people in wheelchairs (who might overhear something).

HIPPA may mean patients will die prematurely, albeit with
their privacy intact.  "Sunshine Cleaning" will get rich.

Keith

In my particular case, it is financial information, including my SS#. The fact that these guys even asked me to send a PDF via email with that info on it gives me pause. They did have a fax alternative, but as you said, their are dangers there, albeit not as visible. It all comes down to what risks are we willing to take with confidential information.

I wish for a day where we did not have to be so paranoid about these things. Sadly, that will most likely never happen.

   Well, network gurus, I need your help again.

   Bought a JetDirect external print server 300X and hooked it up to the HP
Color LaserJet 2550L printer (I no longer have parallel printer cables and
Free Geek had only the Paleolithic dual-DB25-male cables ... after a search
in the back room). So, I bought a Centronics parallel cable at ENU and
connected the printer and print server.

   The 300x test function prints out 2 pages of network configuration. CUPS
(via the Web interface) automatically assigned the address of 192.168.55.101
and won't let me change it. I think the JetDirect has a dhcpd server
internally. According to the output from my pressing the 'test' button on
the 300x, the host name is NPIEED08D and is configured by DHCP. The IP
address is as above, but the server shows the BOOTP/DHCP server IP address
as 192.168.55.200. That's a big problem as that's been the address of the
local wireless access point for a half-dozen or so years.

   Result: I cannot print to the 2550L and when I try to use the CUPS web
interface it asks for a user and password, but says it sees 'CUPS' as the
user.

   Shutting off the printer restores the wireless access point.

   Can I just change the WAP's IP address in /etc/hosts to resolve this
problem, or is there more work I need to do?

TIA,

Rich

Kirk,

   Powering on the JetDirect? There is no power switch, just plugging in the
A/C line.

The Jet Direct has 'no' dhcp server, just a client to receive and address.
If it is still conflicting with the wireless and you can live with out the
wireless for a few minutes... Telnet to the IP, ID admin  and just press
Enter to the pwd prompt.  Using Help or ? you should be able to figure out
hoe to set the Jet Direct to a static IP of your choice.

Unplug it, hold the Test and plug it in and wait for the lights to quit
blink'n release the test.   If that doesn't work look for a pin-hole reset
button

   No user name or password required. I changed the IP address to
192.168.55.194; telnet and '/' confirms that. I can ping that address. But,
CUPS still sees the printer at 192.168.55.101, despite my stopping and
restarting the CUPS server.

   The JetDirect communicates with the printer, and I can telnet to the
JetDirect and ping it. What do I need to do now so CUPS gets with the
program and allows me to print to that printer?

Subject: [PLUG] Brand X laser toner cartridges?
Message-ID: <20110915025730.GA15084@gate.kl-ic.com>

Anyone have good luck with "brand X" toner cartridges (specifically
for the HP1600/2600, Q600[0123] {KCYR} )? 

In the past, I've refilled my own cartridges with toner from
tonerrefillkits.com, but that is a little messy and time 
consuming.  Though their refill toner for most machines is 
excellent, the Q6000 black toner comes out gray.  So, I am
looking for substitutes. 

I've had OK luck with Cartridge World toner, but it isn't
much cheaper than original HP.  I've had terrible luck with
Office Max branded substitutes - their red cartridge spilled
toner into the optical calibration paths, and on circuit
boards, and I had to disassemble the entire printer and
clean it one part at a time.

So, who is cheap and good for toner cartridges, especially
mail order?

I have used thousands of toner cartridges over the years, mostly
remanufactured. However, I am not familiar with your printer, so I
don't have any specific brand recommendations.

I have bought the majority of my cartridges on eBay. If you buy from a
seller with a good rating and the listing gives you the right to return
defective products, all you will be out is return postage. Still, it's
an iffy process. I've had brand new genuine HP cartridges fail. And
you can have warranty issues even buying OEM cartridges. I currently
have a brand new Lexmark cartridge that failed after the first 100
pages, with a lifetime warranty from Lexmark, but they won't honor the
warranty because I bought it on eBay instead of directly from Lexmark. 

The problem is that a printer cartridge contains a number of components
besides just the toner, and any one of them can fail, rendering the
cartridge worthless. As you discovered, having a seal fail creates a
miserable mess. But you can also have failures of the mag roller, drum,
wiper blades, and several other parts.

A quality remanufacturer will do more than just test a few pages of a
remanufactured cartridge. There is expensive test equipment that can
predict a failure of a component, but cheap remanufacturers do not own
such equipment. The worst ones are the "drill and fill" people, who
just add more toner to the existing cartridge. They don't even open the
cartridge.

If you buy an OEM cartridge directly from HP it is likely
remanufactured. All printer vendors encourage recycling of used
cartridges, and they actually do use the old cartridges to make new
ones. The secret to their success is that they replace almost
everything inside the cartridge. 

Internal components were engineered to last the lifetime of the toner
the cartridge originally shipped with, plus a safety factor of
typically 50%. The drum (the most expensive component) is usually good
for twice the original toner. With luck you can get most of the life out
of a drill and fill before one of the components fails. If your
remanufacturer replaces additional parts you may get the entire use of
the cartridge. 

A good tip is to avoid old stock. The mag roller eventually fails in a
cartridge just sitting on the shelf. 

If you have specific brands that you are considering, let me know. I
have bought a lot of different brands over the years and I may have
some scar tissue to share.

Keith,

   I've been buying refilled cartridges for my LJ 5 from Cartridge World for
years. They sell the higher capacity version and I've had absolutely no
issues or problems with them. Cheap? Shrug. But, they re-furbish the
cartridges before filling them so I always bring them my empties. There's no
core charge, but they do use genuine HP cartridge cases and parts.

   For me, buying from them saves time and effort.

wes,

   Thanks to your prompting, I remembered that I needed to delete the printer
then add it back in, not modify what's there. Modification does not allow
changes to the name or connection.

   It took a few delete/add cycles to get it right, but now it works.

Thanks for the clue,

Rich

   I cannot print a pdf file from xpdf (CUPS shows it completed printing, but
the printer does not respond or produce output). However, I can print the
same file from within acroread.

   Probably cannot fix this problem (and I don't print many color pages in
any case), but I think it's rather strange behavior.

Does lpr work from the command line?  What command is xpdf using?  Do
you perhaps need to specify the print queue?  For example, when I want
to print duplex, I change the xpdf command from "lpr", which uses the
default queue, to "lpr -Pduplex", which uses a different queue named
duplex.

Galen,

   Yep. But not with the color laserjet, only the LJ5

   lpr -P <printer_name>

   The default is laser5_duplex but I change that to colorp

   I do, when it's not the default.

   I have the LJ5 defined as two different queues in CUPS: laser5_duplex and
laser5_single. There's also cups_pdf (which I've not used since I don't know
what it does different from other definitions), and colorp.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1109160635380.26931@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Eventually, but not today, I'd like to understand why lpr works with the
LaserJet 5 but not with the Color LaserJet 2550L. To satisfly my insatiable
curiosity.

   Both are network nodes. The LJ5 has an internal JetDirect card and has IP
address 192.168.55.192. The CLJ2550 has an external JetDirect 300x (cat5
input, Centronics parallel cable output) and an IP address of
192.168.55.194.

   In my ignorance, the only obvious difference is whether the JetDirect is
an external server or an internal card. Where might I learn why that would
make a difference in response to printing using lpr?

Can you elaborate a bit on what you mean by not working? Does lpr give any
output at all? What DOES work when printing to the color LJ?

Well for starters when printing with lpr you may need to specify the 'queue'
name to print to. HP uses raw, raw1, raw2, raw3, text, text1, text2, text3,
TEXT, TEXT1, TEXT2, TEXT3, RAW, RAW1, RAW2 RAW3, auto, auto1, auto2, auto3
binps and d1prn  depending on the model and the interface.

Don't know what kind if any firewalling you have internal but lpd uses port
515 where a lot of PJL/PCL printers use 9100

Subject: [PLUG] Dual Boot Troubles
Message-ID: <4E735C7B.7090305@comcast.net>

In the spring of 2006 I bought an Acer Aspire 1640Z laptop. Yesterday I 
upgraded the RAM to 2 GB and bought a 320 GB hard drive for it so I 
could have both Win XP and Linux on it in a dual boot configuration.

Step one was to install XP. After a half an hour of searching all the 
places I store CDs I finally remembered that this laptop did not come 
with a Windows CD. Instead "they" had me burn one. I ran across 
something on the Internet that said this was not uncommon. Anyway, I 
found the CD I burned labeled "Acer Aspire 1640Z Factory Default Image" 
dated Saturday, May13, 2006. I put that CD in the drive and powered up 
the machine. I watched it run for about 25 minutes with everything 
looking normal until it died with the message, "NTLDR IS MISSING".

Googling showed me that there are a number of likely causes but none of 
the ones I tried made any difference.

I decided to move on to my Ubuntu install, which worked just fine. When 
Ubuntu gave me the option for partitioning I gave the XP partition about 
80 GB, which is the size of the old drive, and left the rest for Ubuntu.

I thought that when Ubuntu was finished I'd be able to look at the dual 
boot options and see if there was something to tweak on the XP side. 
When the Ubuntu install (10.04, if it matters) was finished I booted up 
and saw something flash by before Ubuntu loaded. It said something about 
there not being something. It went by fast enough that I couldn't tell 
what it said, but I guess it's related to not having a bootable XP where 
it was looking.

At this point I'm looking for alternatives. One I can think of is to 
somehow do the low level copy of the old drive to the new one which 
would give me my existing XP. While it would be nice to start with a 
clean install, I don't have any real problems with the old one. Is this 
a practical solution? If not, are there other solutions?

I expect that I'll have to open up my desktop machine, disconnect one of 
the hard drives on it, connect the laptop drive (I have the little gizmo 
that adjusts the connection size to fit) and use dd to put an image of 
the 35 GB C: drive on my desktop machine. One of the partitions on this 
machine has 45.2 GB available. After that I'd swap out the old laptop 
drive, put in the new laptop drive and reverse the process.

Is that enough to make it bootable, or is there some other magic I need 
to do to the new drive's MBR? Could it be that said magic is what's 
missing from yesterday's work?

Thanks for any ideas.

wes,

   lpr sends data which the CUPS web interface reports as a completed job,
yet other than a brief flicker of the print server's activity light there is
no output from the printer. It doesn't even wake from its slumber.

   All I've tested so far is acroread on the .pdf I could not print from the
command line or from within xpdf. Haven't yet tried epdfview or any other
application. I'll do this Real Soon Now.

Thanks,

Rich

Kirk,

   Of course! While the default is laser5_duplex, when I want the color
printer I specify colorp. This worked with the HP Professional 2500C
(inkjet) but not with the color laser.

Rich, if you haven't already done so, I suggest taking a look at the
cups log files.  On my CentOS system they are located under /var/log/cups.

My best guess as to the problem is that the print data is not being
passed through the appropriate filter/driver for your printer.

Galen,

   Oops! Looking at the cups log completely escaped my attention.

   Ectually, there's a write permission issue, but I don't know for whom:

E [15/Sep/2011:08:19:09 -0700] [cups-driverd] Unable to write
"/var/cache/cups/ppds.dat" - Permission denied

   Of course, it works for laser5_duplex and laser5_single, but not colorp. I
just changed the permissions on /var/log/cups/ to 777. Will test later.

Thanks for the reminder,

Rich

I think you wanted to change permissions on /var/cache/cups, not
/var/log/cups.

   Well, well, well. Tried printing a .pdf from the command line with
lpr -P colorp <filename.pdf>

   According to /var/log/cups/access.log,

localhost - - [16/Sep/2011:11:54:25 -0700] "POST /printers/colorp HTTP/1.1"
200 469 Create-Job successful-ok
localhost - - [16/Sep/2011:11:54:25 -0700] "POST /printers/colorp HTTP/1.1"
200 254021 Send-Document successful-ok

   Nothing in the error.log. JetDirect activity light blinked a while, so did
the printer's green light. Now the activity light is off and the printer's
light is steady. No output.

   The CUPS web interface shows the job as processing.

Yes, that process should work, but there is an easier way. If you have
access to a IDE to USB adapter (I have one I would be willing to loan) just
swap out the drives, boot from a live linux CD then use dd to copy straight
from the old laptop drive to the new one.  Once done, use gparted to resize
the partitions to take advantage of the larger hard drive and it should be
fine.

Yes. I do have one of those. I'll give that a try tomorrow afternoon.

I thought those USB drive devices didn't expose everything. I'll see 
when I try it.

If at least one of the old or new drives is WD or Seagate you can
download free software from the respective manufacturer to do disk
cloning (and backups as well as many other drive-related tasks). They
are OEM-ified Acronis True Image. I've had no trouble using either
package, including cloning an old drive to a partition sized to my
liking on the new drive.

Download is around 120MB.

I have heard similar about them but I have never had a problem with using
them with dd.  I think they don't work well for data recovery or forensics,
but that is a much lower level than what you are using it for.  Should work
fine.

Good luck,
 Jason

They are both WD drives. I'll look for that, too.

Yes, it's this Sunday, September 18, 2011!

Where: 	Free Geek, 1741 SE 10th Avenue, 97214
When:	1 to 5 pm

Bring your Linux computer that's being a brat and we'll turn it into a
model of decorum. Bring your <insert evil operating system> computer
and we'll turn it into a lovely Linux computer.

We have keyboards, mice, monitors and miscellaneous other hardware and
tools. Generally, all you need to bring is the box. We also have
the latest versions of most major distros and can burn you a CD or a DVD
in a few minutes. 

And if you're a Linux guru, we need you too. The Clinic is an excellent
way to help others while learning how to support Linux.

Message-ID: <20110917144921.ba2fc2f8.jhsu802701@jasonhsu.com>

Swift Linux offers not only Diet Swift Linux (no OpenOffice) and Regular Swift Linux (Diet Swift Linux + OpenOffice) but also special editions consisting of special wallpaper and a sound clip that plays at startup (the song "You Belong With Me" in Taylor Swift Linux, loons calling in Minnesota Swift Linux, and the song "Lake Shore Drive" in Chicago Swift Linux).

Yes, the special editions of Swift Linux are inspired by Hannah Montana Linux.

Because Portland has one of the heaviest concentrations of Linux users, is home to the Linux Foundation, and is the birthplace of FreeGeek, I'm adding Portland Swift Linux to the lineup.  I want Swift Linux to go viral.  This would attract developers who can help me further improve Swift Linux, and that would allow it to spread to even more users.

Are there any particular landmarks that should be showcased in the wallpaper?  (For Minnesota Swift Linux, I use the Duluth lift bridge and the Spoonbridge and Cherry sculpture.  For Chicago Swift Linux, I use the Chicago skyline and Buckingham Fountain.)

Are there songs about Portland I could use for the startup sound clip?  Are there any particular sounds that are uniquely Portland?

Some slogans for the desktop wallpaper would also help.  (The Minnesota edition has "You're gonna make it after all!" in tribute to Mary Tyler Moore.  The Chicago edition has "Chicago is the city that works.  Chicago Swift Linux is the OS that works."  The Taylor Swift edition has "You belong with Linux.")

Message-ID: <20110917142342.8d914dce.jhsu802701@jasonhsu.com>

I am Jason Hsu, the founder and lead developer of Swift Linux.  I'm nowhere near Portland (1700 miles to your east), but I've heard that Portland is one of the most Linux-heavy areas here in the US, ranking up there with Silicon Valley.  I understand that Portland is home to the Linux Foundation and the birthplace of FreeGeek.

Swift Linux is based on antiX Linux and inspired by Linux Mint and Puppy Linux.  You can learn more at http://www.swiftlinux.org .  Swift Linux has the UNIQUE combination of user-friendliness, a large repository, and lightweight operation.  Linux Mint is user-friendly and has a large repository but isn't lightweight.  Puppy Linux is user-friendly and lightweight but has a tiny repository.

The target markets of Swift Linux are:
1.  Windows XP users
2.  Ubuntu Linux and Linux Mint users scraping by on only 512 MB of RAM
3.  Puppy Linux users who want a larger repository or who don't like the controversial always-root feature
4.  Linux users who don't like the controversial new Unity, GNOME, and KDE user interfaces

I'm looking for developers for Swift Linux.  The version control system is GitHub (https://github.com/swiftlinux), and the bug/goal tracker is Launchpad.net (https://launchpad.net/swiftlinux).  If you have worked on other distros (especially competitor distros), I'm ESPECIALLY interested in your input.

Sigh.

I opened my desktop machine (Ubuntu) to do two things. First, to try to plug my Laptop drive in so I could dd it to an iso, Second, to pull the memory sticks to see which size they are.

One set of drive cables in the desktop machine has the filled-in hole in the plug, which I assume is to insure that it is plugged into the drive the right way. My 2-1/2" adapter does not have a pin missing. The other set of cables is compatible, so I disconnected one of the secondary drives I have on the machine and plugged in the drive from my laptop. The machine would not boot. At this point I don't recall just where it failed. But I was able to get into the BIOS and see that it didn't see the laptop drive as installed. 

I returned the cables to their normal drive and then took out the memory. I pulled one of the sticks and found that I have PC2700 DDR333. So the next time I get down to Free Geek when the thrift store is open I can get the right speed.

Now for the problem. When I turned the machine back on the bios only got as far as telling me it was going to check the NVRAM, but it never started the count-up. I tried pulling one memory stick, then the other, but that's all the farther it got. Now it doesn't even go that far. All I get is a series of beeps and a blank screen.

I vaguely recall something like this in the past, and IIRC it involved the machine needing to warm up a bit. So, while I've been typing this e-mail I left the machine powered on. Just to confirm the conditions I mentioned above I shut it off and powered it back on. Now I can get to the bios. I can look at the four connected drives. and now it boots, but I have the Ubuntu message:

Errors were found while checking the disk drive for /

F to attempt to fix the errors, I to ignore, S to skip mounting of M for manual

Any advice other than to power down and bring the box to the clinic tomorrow? With the rest of the experiences I've been having this week I'm quite hesitant to let the machine try fixing itself without knowing more about what's going on.

I think the latest imbitations (cf. etymology of "incarnation") of
Ubuntu use Palimpsest disk utility which monitors disks for bad sectors
and other impending disasters. I recently found that it reliably
reported a disk that was about to fail; to the point that Seagate
replaced it under warranty (after additional tests). Whether Palimpsest
is capable of invoking other utilities to repair the disk is a question
I don't have an answer for. 

Unless someone else comes up with a better solution before tomorrow,
bring it to the Clinic.

Your comments caused me to do some deeper Googling. I found a number of 
places talking about a bug causing this error message. I decided to 
choose "I" to ignore the error and keep going. I got the same message 
for each partition on the system. I "I"gnored them all and the machine 
finished booting. I'm writing this message on it, now.

I guess I won't know for sure until I try booting it again -- which will 
happen in a few minutes when I move the box off the desk and put it back 
in it's normal home.

Thanks for the prompt.

On 09/17/2011 05:03 PM, Richard C. Steffens wrote about hardware problems:

To try to make a long story short, I opened my desktop machine, fiddled 
with drive cables, then removed and replaced memory. Upon restarting the 
machine I got as far as just before the NVRAM check. After a couple of 
minutes I restarted it and got as far Ubuntu checking drives. I got a 
message that there were errors. After leaving the machine powered up and 
in that state for an hour or so while I researched the error message, I 
came back to it and told it to ignore the error message. I got the same 
message for each partition in the machine, and ignored them all. Ubuntu 
came up okay and I was able to get e-mail normally. After powering down 
so I could move the box back under the desk and powering up I 
encountered beep codes and a blank screen. I left the machine in that 
state for 10 or 15 minutes and tried again. Instead of an error message 
I got to the point where Ubuntu wanted to check all the drives. It had 
done that just the other day so I told it not to check. Ubuntu continued 
to load and has been running okay since then -- late this afternoon.

My conclusion, after remembering I had this problem back when I first 
upgraded from 512 MB to 1GB of RAM, is that the motherboard probably has 
a hairline crack that seals itself when it warms up. My current plan is 
to leave it running until I replace it with a better machine from the 
fine offerings at the Free Geek Thrift Store. I was pleased to see how 
much machine could be had for so little money.

So, I won't be bringing it to the clinic, tomorrow. Turns out I have to 
help can peaches, anyway. Should be a nice, cool day for it. We usually 
have to do it when it's hot out. But canned O'Henry peaches are worth 
the trouble.

The first thought I had for a Portland band was Everclear, followed by
Seafood Mama / Quarterflash. Make three (four?) versions if you want
to include Decemberists as the bands differ quite a bit.

Workflow would be simpler in my wife's new office if we could 
print envelopes with postage - one operation rather than three.
There are apps for PC and Mac that do this.  Is there anything
available for Linux, or a webapp accessable with a browser?

I may have to buy a Mac Mini.  At least they run BSD, and
I can kinda trust one connected to the internet through a

drive it from a script (permitting more automation).

Sounds like just the ticket, although my disks are magnetic.  Thanks for the
edification; for others unfamiliar with palimpsest:

palimpsest pal"imp*sest (p[a^]l"[i^]mp*s[e^]st), n. [L.
 palimpsestus, Gr. pali`mpshstos scratched or scraped again,
 pali`mpshston a palimpsest; pa`lin again + psh^n to rub, rub
 away: cf. F. palimpseste.]
 A parchment which has been written upon twice, the first
 writing having been erased to make place for the second. The
 erasures of ancient writings were usually carried on in
 monasteries, to allow the production of ecclesiastical texts,
 such as copies of church services and lives of the saints.
 The difficulty of recovering the original text varied with
 the process used to prepare the parchment for a fresh
 writing; the original texts on parchments which had been
 washed with lime-water and dried were easily recovered by a
 chemical process, but those erased by scraping the parchment
 and bleaching are difficult to interpret. Most of the
 manuscripts underlying the palimpsests that have been revived
 are fragmentary, but some are of great historical value. One
 Syriac version of the Four Gospels was discovered in 1895 in
 St. Catherine's Monastery at Mount Sinai by Mrs. Agnes Smith
 Lewis. See also the notes below. --Longfellow.
 [1913 Webster]

 Note: Palimpsest is the name given to ancient parchments
 which have been used more than once for writing
 purposes. The conquest of Egypt by the Saracens in the
 7th century cut off from Europe the papyrus which was
 used to write on, and parchment could be had only in
 limited quantities. So through the dark ages, old
 manuscripts were used, after removing the first writing
 upon them. Sometimes the writing was washed off with a
 sponge, and the parchment smoothed with pumice stone;
 at other times the letters were scraped away with a
 sharp blade. Nearly all ancient manuscripts, however,
 were written with an ink which could not be entirely
 removed, and traces of a former writing could be seen
 beneath the new copy. In modern times there have been
 various efforts to restore these ancient writings by
 some chemical treatment. In this way have been found
 copies of the Republic of Cicero, the Institutes of
 Gaius, a part of the Epistle to the Romans, and other
 parts of the Old and New Testaments. The Republic of
 Cicero was covered by a commentary on the Psalms,
 written by St. Augustine. --Student's Cyclopedia, 1897.
 [PJC]

 Note: In an auction on November 6, 1998, a 12th-century
 palimpsest of one of Archimedes' works was sold for 2
 million dollars. The 174-page book, the oldest known
 copy of Archimedes' work, had been owned by a French
 family since the 1920s, and was sold by Christie's
 auction house in New York to an unidentified private
 American collector. The palimpsest volume includes
 notes and calculations for two of the Greek
 mathematician's most famous theories, On Floating
 Bodies and Method of Mechanical Theorems. A Christie's
 spokesperson said the buyer, who was not identified,
 indicated that the work would be made available to
 scholars. Also bidding was the Greek government, which
 claimed the work was stolen from a library in the
 former Constantinople, now Istanbul, and belonged to
 Greece. According to the Athens News Agency, the
 Patriarchate of Jerusalem took Christie's to court
 claiming that the manuscript was part of its library,
 which had been transferred to Istanbul and later to
 Athens for safekeeping. The court, however, ruled that
 Christie's had the right to auction the manuscript for
 a French family, which claimed to own it for the last
 75 years since one of the family's ancestors bought it
 from Orthodox monks in Istanbul. According to the
 court's ruling, French law applied in the case, under
 which a person who holds any object for more than 30
 years becomes its rightful owner.

Dazzle runs on wine, though it is very clunky to use and you have to 
type your password whenever it starts because of a wine-related(?) bug 
in retrieving the password from "the registry".  I keep it running by 
itself in a VNC session and only speak to it via the "XML interface" 
(which is attached with duct tape and activated via the "windows 
command-line").  It prints to a postscript file (courtesy of CUPS) and 
all of this is managed by the app and DB which have much more to do 
than print postage.

Endicia also has an "enterprise server" "solution", which I'm guessing 
is exactly the same as what you would find by sniffing the network 
traffic off of the dazzle desktop software, but it took a week for 
an "enterprise sales representative" to write back to me with no useful 
information.  I imagine that someone will have to violate the terms of 
service to make and publish something which allows endicia's customers 
to use Linux without so much hassle.

Excellent choice. 

But lest we forget, the Kingsmen version of Louie, Louie #55 in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest songs of all
time.

They were from Portland.

Thanks but ...

Before this gets too far:  no, we are not going to run windows
apps, under wine or vmware or native.  The  windows security
model, and the programs designed for it, is awful.  Perhaps
there are people who are competent to maintain windows app
security, but I am not one of them.   I'd rather eat glue:
http://weheartit.com/entry/13530002

This is for a medical office - HIPAA is growing an
enforcement arm, and the consequences of a security
breach can be bankruptcy and prison time.

The postage programs reach out over the internet to the USPS,
making them a path for malware.  I am semicompetent to keep
malware out of a Linux system.  I can hire others who can do
an excellent job.  The Mac/BSD security model is robust, and
similar enough to Linux to learn quickly.

Either native Linux apps, or Mac if we have to.  A Pitney-Bowes
meter is time consuming and expensive, but if the alternative
is a Windows program, a meter is damned difficult to zombie.

If someone wants to buy one of the windoze programs, wrap it
inside a web app, and sell me PNG postage images over the
net, I'll buy from them, and let them manage the security
issues.  Why buy the cow ... ?

Sadly, ssh won't provide access to Mac GUI apps, though VNC will give 
you remote desktop access.

Scripting Mac apps is possible via AppleScript, though I've only 
dabbled in it enough to make a mess of things. :-)

This kind of suggests to me a driver issue in CUPS. Enscript converts the
file before sending it. CUPS tries to determine how much server-side
processing is necessary before sending data to the printer to do the
printer-side processing. I'm only guessing here... it seems as though CUPS
thinks the job requires less processing (converting) than it really does. So
it's sending data to the printer that it can't process itself, which your
other printer can. I'm not sure what exactly to suggest in fixing it, hoping
someone else jumps in here. Possibly try a few different drivers for your
color LJ, or define it as a generic.

wes,

   Interesting thesis. I've had only HP printers since I started with linux:
a 4L, 5, Professional Series 2500C, and now the CLJ 2550L. The first three
had no problems printing from lpr with the default CUPS installation.

   There is a PDF-CUPS definition that I've not used before. I'll give that a
try and see what, if anything, happens.

Many thanks,

Rich

Hello all,

Our IPv6 speaker will be unavailable for the PLUG Advanced slot this 
month and I'd like to have a roundtable about modern web serving:

The CGI era gave way to LAMP and we're now onto the next generation:

- node.js and NoSQL make LAMP overkill for many situations

- AJAX/JavaScript are moving much application logic to the browser

- Apache is giving way to nginx, Lighttpd, node.js and others

- We've gone from 9" Mac support to 1024 X 768 and now to 4" phones

- Users now routinely block ads, scripting and Flash

- Apple has declared war on Flash!

- HTML 5 and CSS 3 are starting to appear in the wild

- Security is finally coming first, not last


How have these factors changed the way you serve web content?

Are the fundamental problems being solved and making your job easier?

Please share your experiences at this roundtable and bring your questions.


When: Tuesday, September 20th, 7PM

pdf-cups is meant for print to file capability.  It's not going to
help you.

I agree with Wes.  The problem is likely related to cups magic
filtering.  What printer language are you using with each of your
printers?

This will not be touched by human hands.  A program on a linux
machine will remotely start an AppleScript (?) on the Mac to
print a postage label, in whatever format the postage program
emits (worst case, a postscript to a printer) then suck the
image back in, crop and manipulate it if necessary, then 
construct an envelope image (with address and return address)
and print it.  Perhaps I can assemble the whole image on the
Mac and print it from there, but my experience with Macs is
that the programs want to do things /their/ way.

If this is a monthly mailing to some patients, the Linux 
script may also add the postal bar coding, and print out
a heap of envelopes and accompanying letters, ZIP5 sorted.

As long as the application is scriptable in some manner,
and I can launch a script and move files over the office's
ethertubes, I can automate the whole process - except for
folding the paper and stuffing the envelopes, and I can
hire that out +/-HIPAA.

The big remaining problem is making sure the correct letter
goes in the correct envelope - I will probably add images
to specifically match envelope to letter, an example of the
sort of oddball thing I can't expect a closed source user
application to do.

The last time I checked with the post office was several years ago. At
that time all mail was scanned and, if the sender had added a barcode
with their computer, the barcode was ignored and the post office added
their own. The mail did not go any faster because the sender had added
a barcode.

The exception was mailings of 500 or more delivered to the
bulk mail unit or to the loading dock. They spot check a few barcodes
to make sure you did it right, and if you have a first class permit,
you are entitled to a postage discount. 

I would suggest checking with them for current information on the
above issues. I am probably pretty far out of date.

galen,

   I assume the default CUPS assigns when the printer driver is selected. For
the color lj:

Description:	HP Color LaserJet 2550L
Location:	Office
Driver:	HP Color LaserJet 2550 Series Postscript (recommended) (color, 2-sided printing)
Connection:	socket://192.168.55.194:9100
Defaults:	job-sheets=none, none media=na_letter_8.5x11in sides=one-sided

   For the LJ5:

Description:	Double-side
Location:	Office
Driver:	HP LaserJet 5 - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.2.4 (grayscale, 2-sided printing)
Connection:	socket://192.168.55.192:9100
Defaults:	job-sheets=none, none media=na_letter_8.5x11in sides=two-sided-long-edge

   So, the monochrome is using CUPS+Gutenprint and the color doesn't know
from Gutenprint. In the list of potential drivers, the selected one is the
only driver specifically referencing the 2550.

galen/wes, et al.:

   epfdview has no issues printing to the color laserjet. It worked fine. So
far, it's only xpdf that gives me problems. I'll try an application like
GRASS or R and see what they do.

   With alternate pdf viewers not xpdf printing to the color printer is no
big deal, but it is an interesting conundrum.

   Just tried mupdf. Talk about minimal! I had to download the "manual" (a
few lines of the functions it knows) to figure out how to page forward and
back, and to quit. Wonder what its niche is.

I think in order to progress with this situation, one would need more
information, unless someone were already familiar with these conditions and
knew the answer.

If this were my setup, well, firstly I'd say "I'll just use something else"
- but if I did get curious enough to investigate further, I'd start looking
at how xpdf does its job. Watching CUPS logs is a good starting point for
this, as well as Tools like strace and ltrace. I don't know if lpr has its
own logging capabilities. If so, I'd be looking into them.

Wes,

   I started with this premise. :-) I wrote that I was just curious why xpdf
was recalcitrant, and the thread unraveled to where we now are.

   As long as I know not to try printing a .pdf file to the color laserjet
via lpr, I can get done what I need to do. Which is run my business.

Thanks to you and Galen,

Rich

   Er, yep. In defense of my apparently insufficiently awake state, I tried
wget only after 4 attempts from their web site failed.

Subject: [PLUG] Permissions setting for USB program
Message-ID: <4E78D4AE.3020702@comcast.net>

Have a USB foot pedal for use in transcribing. I also have a foot pedal 
utility program for using the foot pedal to control various programs. 
When I run the program for the first time after the foot pedal is 
plugged in to a USB port I get a permissions error message:

---------------------------------------------------
Permission lacking

You need permission to access the device. Try entering
the following command:
sudo chmod a+r /dev/usb/hiddev0
---------------------------------------------------

Is there some place I can configure something so that permission is 
given to that device whenever it is plugged in?

OS is Ubuntu 10.04.

Thanks.

try adding a udev rule with the following lines in it:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="*0bb4*", MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="*0bb4*", MODE="0666"

of course change the 0bb4 with the vendor ID of your device. You will also
need to restart the udev service (or reboot) to get the new rules to take
effect.
You can look at the existing rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/  Just create a new
one with a name like "footpedal.rules" and match the permissions of the
other files.

udev is what handles that. You can create a custom rules file, which 
must be named with a ".rules" extension. I *think* the snippet below 
would work, but you'll want to test it.

   # /etc/udev/rules.d/footpedal.rules
   KERNEL=="usb/hiddev[0-9]*", MODE="0644"

Huh.  Odd, I just tried it and got a 404 error.  (Well, whatever
triggers Frontier's DNS re-writing sca^Hheme.)  Ping gives me
100% data loss.  Perhaps there's a DNS hiccup?

BTW, Rich, what version of Emacs are you using?  According to EmacsWiki, org-mode is part of GNU Emacs since v22.1.  I just tried it, and yes, it's there.  I'm using v23.2.1, which is the latest for Fedora 14.

Dale,

   23.something. My research revealed that it has been included in emacs
since 22.something. Of course, I need to learn it Real Soon Now.

   Is anyone here familiar with urxvt (rxvt-unicode)specifically? I just
added that package to my system in hope of resolving the problem of accents
not displaying in virtual terminals and alpine, and seeing X in spaces in
some received messages to which I compose a reply.

   I've read the man pages but am not sure just what options to specify (and
I think they all go in ~/.Xdefaults) to return the console font to
legibility and return the color of directory names back to yellow (as set in
/etc/DIR_COLORS) from the blue to which urxvt changed it.

   There is no 'showfont' command here so I don't have any idea what console
fonts are available to me. I use 10x20 which was quite clear and readable
with rxvt windows but is larger and much less clear in the urxvt
windows.

I could easily be wrong, but I don't think a restart is needed.

"Assuming you are on a recent kernel with inotify support, udev will
automatically monitor your rules directory and automatically pick up

Galen, you are correct!  So long as the device is attached AFTER the udev
rule is in place, it will work properly.  If you create or change the udev
rule with the device attached, you will need to either restart the service
or simply unplug and reconnect the device.
This makes sense, I just wished I had realized it earlier when I was trying
to flash the ROM on my Android phone...  It would have saved me some time
and frustration...

Live and learn.  Thanks for pointing this out,
 Jason

Anybody know of a way to do that from the command-line?  I can do it 
with a power-control-enabled hub, but otherwise can't seem to find a 
way to generate a usb disconnect from software.

Thanks,

I tried Paul's idea first. It didn't work.

I tried Jason's next and they work. I didn't get the message about 
restarting the service until after I had rebooted, so I'll have to try 
that when I set this up on my laptop.

Thanks for all the advice.

Here's my rule file:

# /etc/udev/rules.d/footpedal.rules
#
# Set permissions for USB footpedal Infinity IN-USB-1
#

The problem with getting XP installed and then Ubuntu was with the image 
I made back in 2006 of the original XP installation. My laptop's DVD 
drive -- the one on which it was burned -- would not read it. However 
another drive was able to read it and write out a DVD that was readable 
on the laptop. XP is now running with a minimal number of programs my 
wife and I need. The rest of the drive is devoted to Ubuntu 10.04. I'm 
now working on installing all the stuff I want. I suspect it will take 
me a few days of looking around on my desktop machine to find all the 
stuff I will discover I need on the laptop, but I'm on my way.

Thanks for all the advice.

Message-ID: <20110922214247.GB12177@gate.kl-ic.com>

I'm putting together an asterisk system for my wife's office.  
I would like it to be ready to go when the phone lines are 
installed, but I don't have a good way to test the behavior
of the system with three incoming voice lines (which will be
on a rollover hunt group) beforehand.  We just have one line
coming into the house, where I am doing the work.  

Does anyone have an asterisk test system with 3 FXS ports
(that is, the "provider" ports that talk to desksets) that
pretends to be the PSTN?  Can I borrow it or a week or two,
either your place or mine?

I have a Linksys ATA, 2-line I think.  FreeGeek gets 'em in sometimes.
That's 2 FXS ports -> an ethernet port.

Allow me to apologize for the test messages. I have been having a devil
of a time getting my Android phone to send a message to the PLUG list.
The native app and the most popular alternative, K9 mail, send the
message from johnxj at comcast dot net, but prepend the Google address
required on Android phones, which the PLUG mail server refuses to
accept. I also tried Xfinity, a Comcast Android app, but it checks mail
every hour and the "Manual" option is broken. So now I am using
Maildroid, and it appears that I finally have a mail app that works
correctly. Crossing fingers.

All the googling leads to "reinstall the modules you have installed"

  KDE system, post upgrade an attempt to Configure printers  gives the message:

   * You have old third party modules laying around
  
  Check these points carefully and try ...

Suggestions?

Running Cups directly was a nice work around. 
Then the KDE Printer Configuration worked again...

Message-ID: <4E80AE03.20602@comcast.net>

I've got Ubuntu 10.04 running on my laptop. Now I'm trying to add things 
that I have on my desktop to the laptop. One of those is the Buoh Comics 
Reader. I downloaded the source and am attempting to compile the 
program. I start with ./configure and it does a bunch of checking. When 
it's done it tells me I'm missing some packages:

No package 'glib-2.0' found
No package 'gtk+-2.0' found
No package 'libsoup-2.4' found
No package 'gconf-2.0' found

So, I fire up Synaptic and look for them.

When I type 'glib-2.0' into Synaptic's Quick search I get four entries, 
one of which is installed. It's not clear whether the other three are 
what Buoh is looking for. Here's Synaptic's list. (In the second column 
'(*)' is the Ubuntu logo.)

  S      Package              Installed Ver  Latest Ver  Description
[ ] (*) girl1.0-glib-2.0                    0.6.8-1     Introspection 
data for GLib, GObject, Gio and GModule
[X] (*) libglib-perl         1:1.222-1 1:1.222-1   Perl interface to the 
GLib and GObject libraries
[ ] ( ) libgfccore-2.0-02ca                 2.3.1-7     GTK+ Foundation 
Classes Core - shared libraries
[ ] ( ) libgfccore-2.0-0c2a-dbg             2.3.1-7     GTK+ Foundation 
Classes Core - debug symbols

I tried installing the three that weren't already installed and ran 
configure again. I got the same error message. I must be missing 
something. A clue stick would be appreciated.

Thanks.

You probably need to install the -dev versions of the packages.

   I learned something interesting today and share the information as a
follow up to my recent thread on not being able to print from xpdf to the
color printer.

   xv uses lpr to print and it sent a couple of .jpg files to the 2550L that
printed just fine.

   So, it seems the issue is with xpdf and not lpr.

as rogan suggested, this frequently means you are missing -dev
versions of packages.

i never use synaptic so i cannot help you there, but here's what i'd
do from the command line:

# (1) you probably have glib2 installed already.  so, search the
installed packages for anything with the string 'glib' in their name:
dpkg -l | grep glib

you'll find a lot, but you're looking for the one that is glib, not
something for or involving glib, if that makes any sense.  on my
system, it's:

ii  libglib2.0-0                         2.28.6-0ubuntu1
             The GLib library of C routines

and what you want is to find the dev version:

# (2) search all available packages for ones whose names contain
glib2, and then try to filter down to just -dev packages

apt-cache search glib2 | grep -- -dev

i get 3 hits, but the obvious winner is:

libglib2.0-dev - Development files for the GLib library

# (3) install the development package:

sudo aptitude install libglib2.0-dev


you may not have some of those packages installed - say you are
missing libsoup (you try step (1) with soup instead of glib2 and come
up empty).  then skip straight to (2):

apt-cache search soup | grep -- -dev

...
libsoup2.4-dev - an HTTP library implementation in C -- Development files
...

and then executing 3 will automatically pull in the base package for
you - if it's needed to use the dev package, which is usually the
case:

sudo aptitude install libsoup2.4-dev


hope that helps!

Yes. That did help. I installed the -dev versions for all four missing 
packages:

sudo aptitude install libglib2.0-dev
sudo aptitude install libgtk-2.0-dev
sudo aptitude install libsoup2.4-dev
sudo aptitude install libgconf2-dev

./configure now works.

make gives me a bunch of errors, but that will have to wait for another 
day. Work calls.

Thanks for the help.

And thanks to Rogan and Benjamin for your ideas, too.

i can't remember the path that led me to it, but it was a variety of
display issues with international text vs gnu screen as i recall.
anyway, it did solve those problems and bring new ones :/.  still
overall it is an upgrade for me.

i specify almost all my options in .Xdefaults.  i set a few via the
command line, but they're the same as xterm command line
flags--nothing about the font or colors on the command line.

hmm.  my font looked the same in rxvt/urxvt, although urxvt has an
annoying propensity for bolding it at times--this fortunately stopped
being a problem at some point (now works fine under screen, whereas it
used to kind of trash my display under termcap-heavy apps like
screen/vim/centerim).  you might look for a font that has no bold, or
to somehow set the bold font to the normal font to work around that
tendency if that happens to be the problem you are experiencing.

to actually answer one of your questions, i explicitly change some of
the colors (dark blue is not visible against my preferred black
background) in my .Xdefaults like so:

*Rxvt.colorUL:          Cyan3
*Rxvt.color4:           RoyalBlue
*Rxvt.color12:          RoyalBlue

(affects Rxvt as well as uRxvt.  URxvt* appears to be the appropriate
Xdefaults class if you just want to affect uRxvt).

wish i could recall where i got the font color lists--might have been
in the well-hidden urxvt(7) man page--this is not the same as the
urxvt(1) man page.  you might check it out for more info (man 7 urxvt)

let me know how it goes!

You might want to look at /etc/X11/rgb.txt for the list of colors.

The Linux 3.0.4 kernel is the current kernel.  What is changing from the
long running 2.6 series which has gotten up around 2.6.40 or so?

CentOS 6 unfortunately is down at the 2.6.34 kernel level.  I'm curious
if there are stability and/or other end of life issues for the 2.6
kernel?

Is it true that you have to have a gigabyte or more of ram now to
install CentOS 6?  Huh, my old servers don't have that.

I hope that David Mandel isn't the only person paying attention to my
posts.  He said himself that this Linux list is for the occasional
discussion about non Linux OSS, but I'm being singled out it seems for
community wide censorship.  If that is the case, at least my complaint
will make the mailing list on http://www.pdxlinux.org where people will
hopefully see it and reconsider what they are doing.  Censorship,
especially when the person is asking about Linux on a Linux list, is
just plain wrong.

The 3.0.x series is just an incremental upgrade from 2.6.x. Linus

NOTHING. Absolutely nothing. Sure, we have the usual two thirds driver

Red Hat regularly backports security updates and other key 
enhancements from the current kernel into its production kernel. I 
imagine that process won't change at all with the renumbering.

You need to have that much for the graphical installer to run. You can 
still run the text installer with less than 1 GB, but you won't get 
access to as many install-time options.

If you have a serious need to run CentOS 6 on a machine with less that 
a gigabyte of RAM, I suggest you learn how to configure and use 
the Red Hat/CentOS kickstart installation tools; that's the only route 
to a fully configurable installation on low-memory machines.

So then, replacing 2.6.34 with 3.0.4 should work just fine?
How about for CentOS 6 which is traditionally behind for stability
reasons?  Is 3.0.4 more stable than 2.6.34?

Unless you have a direct need for new feature in 3.0.4, I'd recommend 
against replacing a CentOS kernel. Strongly.

If you have such a need, you'll have to get advice from someone else. 
I don't replace kernels on CentOS boxes.

it's not that "replacing 2.6.34 with 3.0.4 should work just fine" so much as
"replacing 2.6.34 with 3.0.4 should work as well as replacing 2.6.34 with
2.6.35 would have." One could no more strongly state the latter as the
former.

sometimes things change which break other things. there is a reason releases
exist: to test a particular combination of modules. If you want to put
together an untested combination and see if it works, then more power to
you. Let us know how it turns out.

Building an Asterisk system for my wife's office.  3 voice
lines coming in.  She Who Must Be Obeyed says, "no hook
switch flash, no touch tones, I want lights and buttons".  

So - suggestions for IP phones to look at or avoid? 

This is temporary.  Long term, I want to use headsets and computer
screens for the caller information and routing info, but short
term we do it with buttons the old fashioned way. 

Interesting that "someone" and I are both working on Asterisk 
problems.  God has a weird sense of humor, she does.

God is not a woman.  God is a man, Mary's son, and Mary is his female
mother.  Calling God a woman is offensive to both me and Him.  Please
refrain from doing so again.

While I think Keith was just honoring his wife in a humorous way, I also
respect those religions who believe in a supreme being who happens to be
female.

If you expect help from people on this list, if you even expect people
on this list to listen to you, I suggest that you do more to motivate us
to listen. 

In contrast, every time you react in this way, such as with references
to God, censorship, ReactOS, etc. I suspect that you turn off almost all
of us here -- with the possible exception of those who find
entertainment through programs in the Jerry Springer mold.

Thanks,
Mike

Used/cheap is good.  Ciscos are very common.
For new/cheap, there's Aastra.
For new/nice, Ciscos are popular, but Snoms are nicer.

You've already discovered http://www.voip-info.org/ right?

Just so everyone is clear, "God is a man."  Second, He is the same God

Keith has a privilege to post religious opinions that people won't

censorship.  Maybe Keith you should be more professional and avoid
religious/political controversy on a technical support list.  If you and

contrary, please do it elsewhere.

Hi Guys,

I'm unsure when this list became a religious or political debate forum but last I checked this is a linux user group general mailing list. Can we drop this argument shakehands and move on. There are better places and ways to address such.

Not until I am afforded the same privileges and respect as Keith
concerning this argument.  If Keith has a right to put blatant 
and wrong religious statements on this Linux list, than anyone else 
should have the right to disagree with him both openly and
intelligently.  Disproportionately blaming this argument on one person
is wrong, needs to stop, and it can only be stopped by the community.  I
am owed an apology for Keith's lack of professionalism and from other
people as well who know who they are.  I have been singled out for
censorship but Keith has not and the sad truth is, I really do need help
with Asterisk.  The only reason Keith started this argument is to get me
censored so that other people won't help me.  This wasn't a joke between
him and his wife, it was blatant trolling.  Why can't the community see
that and the list moderators reprimand him?

I think you are wrong.  I have been trying to be a part of this list for
years where trouble has been ongoing.  The Linux community may be
welcoming somewhere else, but not here in Portland.  I want to be a part
of the Linux list in my community, but this community is very unchurched
and way too liberal.  This invariably comes up one way or another over
and over and over.  The liberals causing the problem, like Keith, are
never criticized for their behavior and frankly they are never called on
it.  Nobody ever says, "hey Keith, you are blatantly intolerant of the
opposite viewpoint on an issue you shouldn't have brought up in the
first place."  Keith and others have not just done this once, this
happens over and over and over.  It is high time, it is past time for
David Mandel or someone to take corrective action.

It would, indeed, be awesome if folks could keep this off-topic
religious discussion off this list.

Aside from anything else, this divisive and unpleasant tone drives
away valuable contributions and otherwise interesting members of the
list; it would be a shame if we let that happen.

There is a reason other lists kick you off.

Well Bill, you are wrong where trying to harass me privately is still
harassment.  At least by posting this on PLUG others can see that you
are clearly part of the problem and not part of the solution.  If people
do leave this list, it will not be because I tried to logically and
respectfully argue a different viewpoint to Keith's controversial and
wrong religious statement.  I'm still awaiting a community solution to
the Keith can use this as a political/religious rag problem.  If he is
allowed to do so, I should be allowed to do so along with anyone else
who wants to.  That is called free speech by the way.  If nobody should
be allowed to do this, then nobody includes Keith.  If I'm wrong and
people do leave this list because they are intolerant of reasonable and
correct religious beliefs, good riddance.

Danial,
I agree, however we have gone down this road a dozen times before... always
with the same individual.  I am constantly on the edge of unsubscribing to
this mailing list, despite all the GOOD information that is on it.  I have
found that the only way to deal with it is to have an autodelete filter for
any post that contains his name.  sometimes a few messages (like this one)
get through, but it is much better than without the filter.

Jason

Michael,

Not everyone believes as you, and you of all people should understand that in this country, ALL beliefs are valued. The beliefs you are defending so adamantly are held by a minority of humans on the earth. When you allow others to believe what they wish, you will find that your relationship with the other 7 billion people in the world will be much more pleasant. 

What you or I believe about the gender or non-gender of any supreme being is irrelevant in the discussion of Linux.

My mother always taught me to 'Pick my battles'. This is not the time nor the place to argue religion.

Keith made a tongue in cheek (I'm assuming here) remark, and you took the bait. I don't know if he intended it as such or not. Stop taking the bait, and the baiting will stop. You have as much control over letting it go as anyone else. More so in fact, since you are the one taking the heat for taking the bait. Let it go.

I hardly deem it necessary to post to this list, it's often far more
interesting to read what my
elders have to say and deal with; the few times I *have* posted I
haven't been treated with
any disrespect or hostility. It is merely a testament to your own
hostility and berating tone that
seem to earn you the ire of this list.

I admire your dogmatic adherence to your moral ethics and beliefs,
it's something that many
of us (myself included) lack today. What I cannot stand, however, is
your incessant need to fling
these beliefs in the face of contributors to the list, *regardless* of
whatever transgression you
may think they have committed. Simply because other members of the
list have broken the rules
does not justify your, often violent and uncalled for, reactions; if
you are truly a man of God then it
should be a simple matter of staying "above the influence". There's no
reason to poison this
discussion with inane ramblings about God, censorship, reactOS, or any
other babble that doesn't
pertain to a technical question. I think several other members have
attempted to make this point before.

I'd hate to perpetuate this discussion any further, but I want to be
perfectly clear with you here, Michael:
simply because I or other members of this list do not respond
immediately to your emails does not mean
we are in any way censoring your messages. I do, however, find your
questions to be arcane, esoteric, and
generally above my level of competence.

Above all else I am here to learn from the minds of greater Linux
practitioners than I, and I couldn't care less
what personal beliefs they hold. If you ever hope to get *any* sort of
help from this list, I suggest you start
 doing the same.

:FF:

Keith was wrong to do what he did on multiple levels where saying that
all beliefs are equal has a name, it's called pluralism.  Pluralism is
nonsense because it makes believing anything too controversial if the
opposite of that is just as relevant.  If you want to live in a world
where nobody can believe anything because they might offend someone
else, be my guest.  I won't be joining you.

I merely tried to argue against what Keith said with facts and requested
that there be more respect and less censorship.  Clearly, this is too
much to expect from some people on this list.

This list isn't about religion, but does that mean it should be filled
with religious/political commentary that is controversial and by and
large unbalanced?  Keith has done this before and will do this again, as
will others who are trying to use me as a scapegoat for their lack of
professionalism, balance, and courtesy.

Oh, and for those who have commented, consider looking at my arguments
and doing some homework.  I'm sure you'll find that there isn't much
evidence to back up the notion that God is female.  More important than
winning that argument, there is no argument for what Keith did let alone
for letting one person, but not me, get away with it.

What I have done is call Keith on his off topic religious statement to
provide some semblance of balance.  If you can't respect or understand
what I've tried to do here, that is really your problem.

And a thought, if the church is the bride of Christ, than the church is
female and God is male.  From that imagery, mankind is essentially a
woman and only God is a man.  Just another line of argument one might
follow.  There are many lines of argument for God being masculine.

When it comes to religion, there can be and are absolutes where the
alternative, called Pluralism, is really quite absurd.  Belief becomes
worthless if all opposite beliefs are deemed equally valid.  There is a
logic problem.  Pluralism is not a way to honor diversity, it is a
fallacy, a major cop out.  Disagree with me on God's gender, that is
minor compared to disagreeing with me on the problems that exist with
pluralism and preferential treatment.  The preferential censorship has
to stop.  The only thing that can stop the censorship, a critical mass
of people in this community calling for a stop to it.

There should be a rule if someone inappropriately posts a religious
statement that it is fair game for someone to post the other side.

Talking about censoring someone on list when that person is following
the list is cyber bullying and it is wrong.  Someone please speak out

1) 25% at least, arguably more, of the people on this planet believe 
as I do.  Besides, what about respect for minorities?

2) Tongue in cheek is not determinable when one is discussing email.  
What makes Keith putting religiously controversial statements on PLUG
right even if his statement was tongue in cheek?

3) Oregon is probably the least churched state in the entire country.
I've heard that as few as 30% of Oregonians regularly attend weekly
services.  Oregon is not at all, especially western Oregon,
representative of what people believe world wide let alone nation wide.
Saying that Oregon is representative is called lying or in some circles
just statistics.

4) Linus is an atheist last time I checked where I'd love to see him
convert.  It would make his chances of getting to heaven far greater.
So as far as picking ones battles, fighting atheism with the prospect of
influencing Linus could make a major difference in the world.  Linus
isn't the only atheist that would leave atheism most likely upon his
conversion.  Only God can ultimately convert Linus or anyone else for
that matter, but I can try to argue for and pray for his conversion.

5) I didn't pick this forum to argue the gender of God.  Keith did.
This is a major issue that nobody seems willing to address.  This needs
to be addressed, putting all the responsibility on me for this is wrong.

6) I have to stand and fight prejudice or it will just be there tomorrow
waiting for me.  It's not the gender issue I can't let go of so much as
the preferential treatment issue.  I bet nobody who is criticizing me
would be doing so if they agreed with my position.  Nobody is
criticizing Keith that I know of anywhere near the level that I am being
criticized at.

7) I have tried to reason with the community, but the people who have
written so far appear to be unreasonable.

8) What I really want is a statement against censoring people,
especially those who follow the rule Linux/Unix and/or the occasional
open source non-Linux topic.

Another thing, nobody is a "problem" in a truly diverse group of people.
Sure there are those who break the laws that society depends on to
function, but just annoying people doesn't rise to anywhere near that
level.  I'm sorry that people are bringing religious/political hostility
to this list where it typically takes two or more people for a fight to
start.  A sad day it will be if Linux becomes something that only jerks
talk about.  Jerks that are intolerant, unprofessional, and
inconsiderate.

Make no mistake, I will continue to argue for what needs to happen in
this community until the prejudice is stamped out.

Even though my blacklist is now working w/r/t the individual in
question, I still find this thread -- astonishing.

He also asks a --lot-- of questions of this board. I don't think he's
ever offered technical help to anyone on this board. He takes, and does
not give back. 

I suggest that anyone who answers his technical questions is
inadvertently encouraging people who just take from a community, along
with his general nasty demeanor. In my years here, I remember him saying
"thank you" just once.

This thread, and his responses, is an overreaction about one person who
honored his wife in a very American way. Keith's reference to his wife
as a "God" who must be obeyed is a common American male view of
marriage. If you've ever seen her picture on Keith's laptop, it's clear
that he idolizes her. Keith has nothing to apologize for, and can be
proud of the way he honors his marriage, and his work to make his wife's
home office more efficient with Asterisk. 

The reacting individual in question has apparently been haunting this
list with his point of view since at least 2004, ref
http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2004-April/031297.html . So
he's apparently not going to stop soon. 

I understand people who have blacklisted him into their spam filters. I
have now done so reluctantly. It is in essence "changing the channel"
when he speaks. I am reluctant to do so -- as it risks ceding the tone
of this list to people like him.

Given his point of view, it's astonishing that he would use an operating
system created by an atheist. When Keith suggested that we nominate
Linus for the Nobel Peace Prize, this was his reaction:

http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2009-November/066037.html

"The nobel peace prize should not go to an atheist period."

He then compared Linus Torvalds to Mao Tse-Tung and Saddam Hussein. 

Thanks,
Mike

Michael,

You do not balance anything. You bowl it over by dropping a building on top of it. 

Keith made one comment. You've now been spouting your messages for almost 24 hours. 

I am very close to joining those who either call for your removal from this forum for continuously and blatantly violating the guidelines of this forum, or writing my own filter to just simply ignore you. 

You aren't winning any friends here, but I suspect that is not your intention.

You call for equality, and then in the same message tell us you are right and we are wrong.

Subject: [PLUG] Adding an icon to the Gnome launcher panel - Ubuntu 10.04
Message-ID: <4E834A1F.2040700@comcast.net>

I am attempting to duplicate much of what is on my desktop on my laptop. 
One of my activities is transcription of recordings of interviews. I 
used to use Express Scribe on Windows for that but a couple of months 
ago I found two Linux tools that successfully -- for me, anyway -- 
replace Express Scribe. They are the programs Transcribe and Footpedal. 
Both are installed from .deb files. They are now both installed on my 
laptop. The problem is that I don't remember how I got Footpedal onto 
the launcher panel. Transcribe installed itself in the Sound & Video sub 
menu of the Applications menu and it was a simple right-click to add it 
to the launcher panel. I don't find Footpedal in any of the sub menus of 
the Applications menu. I can start Footpedal from the command line, and 
it acts as expected. When installed it displays an icon of a foot over 
next to the date/time display.

I tried right-clicking on the launcher panel and clicking on "Add to 
panel...". But when I type in footpedal the list of available programs 
goes blank.

Any hints on where to look to solve this?

Thanks.

Dick,

   Try 'locate footpedal', (as root) 'find / -name footpedal', or 'which
footpedal'. When you locate the binary you can specify that full path to the
'Add to panel ...' dialog.

Also the command 'which footpedal' should work and will show only the 
executable(s).

I tripped over the solution. I accidentally right-clicked on the desktop 
and found "Create Launcher...". I put in the Name: footpedal and the 
Command: footpedal, and clicked OK. An icon of a foot appeared on the 
desktop with the name "footpedal" under it. It starts up the program 
when clicked.

I also remembered to copy footpedal.rules from /etc/udev/rules.d so that 
I don't have to correct the permissions for it each time it is launched.

While I solved this one myself, I still thank this list for providing 
help on other things.

OK, finally added this to my mail filters:

And now I expect there will be a better signal-to-noise ration on this list,
and I won't be tempted to unsubscribe.

Message-ID: <4E8362A7.8040100@tempusdictum.com>


I'm OK with Unity so far.  I don't like the Dock[1].  I do kinda like
the launcher[2], though it doesn't replace the Menus of the old Gnome
panel.  There are alternatives, including starting up an additional
panel.  But for 2 reasons, I'm reluctant to use those: 1) I really want
to try to use Unity as intended and 2) I don't like clutter and an extra
dock or Gnome panel adds clutter.

What I'd really like is to insert something between the app-specific
"panel" and the notification area, indicated by [3].  Would anyone
happen to know where to look in Unity or Compiz or Ubuntu docs
indicating how to do such a thing?  I'd even be happy with a hook into
the programming documentation.

Message-ID: <4E836849.9080608@comcast.net>

A friend has asked me to help with cleaning off an older computer of 
theirs. Over the years their son downloaded lots of stuff without 
knowing too much about the safety of each site he visited.

The machine is some flavor of Windows -- might be Win98 or XP. They have 
some data they want to keep. My thought is to network their machine to 
my laptop and copy those files. Then, I could reload Windows for them. 
(I don't think I could talk them into Linux.)

My wife is concerned about contaminating my laptop with viruses. I told 
her that Windows viruses don't affect Linux, but she isn't convinced. 
She asked me to ask all of you, and that she'll go along with your 
recommendations.

Any thoughts?

article I've linked is a good intro level explanation of the reasons behind
relative virus vulnerability between windows, linux, and OsX.  It's a few

Michael,

I really enjoyed what you have to say, and it has much truth to it. I fully
support you standing up for your faith in the Objective Truth when that
truth is publicly challenged. I do respect your zeal. If I had been part of
the earlier thread you are referring to, I may have spoken up as well... I
don't know.

That said, I don't see the purpose of posting this new off-topic thread to
the main plug list. This really has nothing to do with Linux. It is not
hiding your light under a bushel to stay on topic in a public forum. If you
must respond, do so in the same thread that had the comments that offended
you.

Censorship is active suppression of speech. No one has suppressed your
speech so far that I can tell. Choosing not to reply to you is not the same
thing as censoring you by disabling your posting privileges. If you continue
posting off-topic threads, especially if you are violating any rules, you
may be censored, and you will have no one but yourself to blame.

If you have a great need to speak about your faith (don't we all?), please
join me over at Christianforums.com (or another topical board). We actually
have plenty of opportunity to witness to non-Christians there, and it isn't
off-topic to do so there. If you do sign up, send me a PM, my handle there
is Protoevangel.

My apologies to everyone for continuing this off-topic conversation; I
expect this to be my only post in this thread.


Best regards,
Daniel M. Head

One possible risk -- does your Linux laptop run any form of WINE, e.g.
code weavers stuff or anything that includes stuff from a Microsoft code
base? There's an article from linux.com on the subject, ref
http://www.linux.com/feature/42031 , but the site is down at the moment.
(It can be found from the google cache.)

If not, then you can safely tell your wife that Linux is built
differently -- it's like a virus is the big bad wolf, Windows is built
with hay, and Linux is built with bricks.

Thanks,
Mike

I tried to connect an analog line to asterisk, with a linksys  little box
and then a relatively expensive PCI card but I had terrible echo on my line
which caused me to give up.

I would try one analog line before committing to that route.  I can loan you
the PCI card to try.

Commodity VOIP numbers are dirt cheap compared to PSTN.  Running mine over a
ADSL line is usually as good quality as an analog line, although there are
occasional glitches.  There are those that believe you need a better
internet connection to run reliable VOIP.

I now use http://pbxinaflash.net/ to configure asterisk. It has a graphical
status screen that your boss might like.

I have a CISCO phone which is great.  I also have a real cheap ebay special
voip phone that is not great.

It wouldn't hurt to boot from a LiveCD and scan the machine beforehand.

The AVG one is pretty good, AFAIK.

Make sure to budget a full day for the reload and patching,

Echo cancellation can be a bear.  Which PCI card?

A little QOS goes a long way.  Of course, bandwidth restriction at the
gateway helps a lot.

I noticed your email address.  You go to any IEEE meetings?

Excellent idea. Thanks. I use AVG on the XP partition on my laptop and 
on my wife's XP desktop.

Recent experience suggests that the modifier "at least" may want to go 
before "full day."

Yes. I do have Wine installed. However, I don't plan to do any more than 
temporarily store some of her files while cleaning up the rest of her 
machine.

I suppose I could create a new partition and stick the stuff in there, 
and then wipe out that partition after I'm done. But that seems a bit 
extreme.

I haven't used those words, yet, but I've described the security first 
philosophy of Unix to her in the past.

Thanks for you thoughts.

Ugh.  Sorry.  They were set to "visible only to you".  I don't normally
use Picasa.  I've reset the album to "visible to everyone on the web".

I remember when this one (http://efn.org/) started out of a closet as well. Clif Cox had 10 Solaris boxes under a staircase in his house? In 1990. I was the network administrator of the local Eugene Fidonet network. I recall when this guy Clif called me? He was part of the (gasp!) internet and he wanted to talk to me!

While a linux machine is typically safer due to separations such as e.g. 
not running the web browser in the kernel and not reading your e-mail 
as root, any computer can have vulnerabilities.

Remember that whatever you execute can do anything your user can do 
(including sudo.)  Security holes tend to come from convenience 
features and unexpected consequences in complicated software.

If you are using `mv` and other command-line tools to move windows files 
around, it is very unlikely that you will get anything on your linux 
machine.  On the other hand, using a file manager means you are running 
more complicated code and you begin to have more exposure where the 
program's convenience features could be exploited, such as automatic 
image preview causing a buffer overflow when given a bad image header.  
Similarly, word processors and web browsers will try to do things with 
a file which wouldn't happen with e.g. `head` or a text editor like vim 
(though even vim will set syntax options based on modelines, which is 
the sort of thing where a potential vulnerability could creep into the 
code.)

I don't know of a case where using nautilus on linux to look at files 
from an infected windows machine would hose your home directory, but 
you should understand risk and exposure if you are concerned about 
security.

Thanks for the cautions. I'll keep that in mind.

I have since learned that it is an XP system, and I have more recent 
experience cleaning up one of those without copying files to another 
machine. Hopefully I won't even have to turn my laptop on.

keep encountering errors of missing source files while someone else running
Slackware has succesfully built and used it.

   I installed Qt3 (that's what QCad wants) and that required that I log out

I have discovered (just now) that gmail not only allows me to
block/delete all email with a specific origin mail address, it also
does deep message scanning, so I can block all emails that even
mention that specific email address (or any arbitrary string, really)

Hi,

Tomorrow I can send you some info on customizing Unity. Ultimately also for quicker response you might consider trying the ubuntu oregon mailing list, irc or forums we have about 150 people on mailing list who run Ubuntu here in Oregon.

Subject: [PLUG] Android Tablets, Kindle Fire?
Message-ID: <20110930155846.GA24316@gate.kl-ic.com>

In a few months, after we get the web-based electronic medical
records systems running at my wife's new office, we will deploy
a few tablet computers.  I would like a camera (for scanning
QR codes and photographing skin conditions), some kind of text
data entry, secure communications, and some form of authentication
and time-out, so that if the tablet is left lying about without
activity it will lock, awaiting a password or some kind of
biometric to unlock.  Wifi, locked to a single encrypted
access point, no phone.

Probably some kind of Android tablet.  Amazon just announced
the $200 Kindle Fire, based on Android - while that probably
has the appropriate hardware, it may be locked as a walled
garden media platform.

Probably too early to say what the Fire will permit.  If dear
reader learns more about the implementation and linux usability
of this device, please share your discoveries on this list.
Other suggestions welcome - spending a few hundred dollars
extra for something that is Just Right would be fine.

    What size tablet are you looking for?  7" ish?  or 10/11" ish?  it would
help narrow down the choices a fair amount.

Yes, but their technical folks are on paper saying that they fully
expect it to get rooted, and they are not really stressed about that
fact.  Which suggests that they are just shrugging, probably cutting
off warranty support for a rooted device, and not investing in
stopping you taking full control of the system.

Which, personally, I would totally do to any Android device given the
ability to do so.  Third party firmwares like CyanogenMOD have been
much better than vendor firmwares - and while Amazon are unproven, and
more invested than most, I don't have that much greater faith.

I tried to install a weather indicator app.  The MyWeatherIndicator one
from here:
http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/01/the-omg-guide-to-must-have-indicator-applets/
 But there was a problem with the apt repository
(ppa:lorenzo-carbonell/atareao).  Is that the one you installed?

I have been reading the Android forums here:

http://androidforums.com/

If you go to the above link and scroll down you will find a list of all
currently available and even not yet released tablets. Each is a link
to a forum for that tablet, with further links to specifications and
other information. 

I have no interest in a tablet, so I haven't been paying attention and
can't offer any suggestions other than the link to a good resource for
information.

I use cyrus sieve to sort my mail as it arrives into my IMAP server.  
Sadly, sieve does not have a built-in way to prune a thread based on 
the address of a sender (because you would need data which is external 
to the message.)

So, I have been looking at using the "References" and "In-Reply-To" 
headers to manage this -- which should do a fairly decent job on trolls 
who have their own domain, since the Message-ID would always contain 
that string.  This also assumes that everyone else's mail client 
includes the threading headers correctly.

  if anyof(
    header :contains "Message-ID"  "example.com",
    header :contains "References"  "example.com",
    header :contains "In-Reply-To" "example.com"
    ) {
    addflag ["\\Seen", "Troll"];
  }

The action could have been 'fileinto "INBOX.trash"; stop;', but I have 
decided to keep the messages and let them fall-through into the folder 
sorting later.

Meanwhile, my sieve rules are now running up against some kind of 32KB 
limit in cyrus?  Time to move on to some mail filtering tech which is a 
bit more modern?

If you install RadioTray, get the latest one from the web.  It has some 
bug fixes.
