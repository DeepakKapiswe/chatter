Thanks! Seems so obvious in hindsight.

Perfect answer! Thanks so much.  I booted with the CD, went to "Rescue 
mode", stumbled a bit with setting up the network, but got it working. 
Now I'm rsync'ing all the files to one of the live machines. Looks like 
all 3 drives are intact. The rescue disc saw them and was able to read 
them, but when I try to boot from either of those hard discs the system 
can't see them. Could it be some conflict with the CMOS and what's 
really hooked up?

Bill,

   You most likely have trashed MBRs so the system cannot see or use then to
boot.

Don't forget that there has been this ugly transition period in the
Linux kernel where originally hard drive device files (/dev/hda*,
/dev/hdb*, ...) were relatively fixed even across different systems
because of the physical cabling.  So long as you hook them up the
same, they appear the same on different mobos.  So distros used to
rely these device names in /etc/fstab .

Recent times has introduced more dynamically named disks.
Throwing in LVM can make this even more tricky.  Recently most distros
have swiched to using UUIDs in /etc/fstab to uniquely identify drives
even when they don't have the same device files.  However, I suspect
based on the age of Bill's system, it was probably built in the
transition period.

Just one hypothesis for the lack of portability...

Carl Symons of LinuxFest Northwest asked on the Scribus e-list if there
was anyone in the area who could give a talk on Scribus and DTP. I
jumped up, waved my arms around, and yelled "here I am, the blond boy
over in the corner!" OK, I really just sent him an e-mail.

It looks possible but there are logistics problems. I can't be gone
from Portland for both days of a weekend. I must go up and come back
the same day, although it can be either day. And driving to Bellingham
and back would suck. Not to mention that I'm not sure my vehicle would
make it that far without a fatal check engine light coming on. 

I know others from this list go up there. And there is also Amtrak,
which is a very pleasant way to travel.

LinuxFest Northwest will be April 30 and May 1, so it's too soon to
finalize plans. But I thought it might be good to add my name to
a list of potential ridees.

The card has been removed and I am trying to use the motherboard's
onboard vga adapter.  How do I undo the damage that installing the
catalyst driver wreaks on the relevant open source free packages?  
I've run the proprietary uninstall command, but I doubt that that 
fixed all issues.  I'm planning on sending the card out for warranty
repair, but in the mean time being stuck at 1024x768 I would at least
like to be able to play some of my old games that still work at this 
low resolution.

I'm on a Fedora 14 64 bit system.  I have an Athlon II 635 64 bit quad
core processor.  The mobo is an MSI 785GM-P45.

The video card is part of a barebones kit I have only had for 5 months,
what is the failure rate for these cards?  I wonder if the card failed
because of something I need to take care of.

Subject: [PLUG] yum update, exclude single files?
Message-ID: <20110302154217.GA24263@gate.kl-ic.com>

I run a Redhat clone (Scientific Linux 5).  It uses "yum" for 
updates.  I know how to exclude packages from update, but how
do I exclude single files?  

In this case, /etc/X11/xorg.conf .  I am using the fglrx driver,
which although closed source (sigh) is about 20x faster (glxgears)
than the open source r500 driver for ATI graphics chips. 
The update package for x11 wants to update xorg.conf for me,
and force me to use r500, bless its pointy little head.

I can probably set the file to read only and chattr it to
immutable, but yum might get vexed, now or after some future
update of yum itself.  I probably could track down the bozo
who decided to include xorg.conf in the update process, and
thrash the living daylights out of him, but people would talk.

If you download the package in question directly and do the update 
with rpm instead of yum, then you can tell rpm to skip some or all of 
the scriptlets launched by the package, e.g.,

   rpm -U --nopre xorg-x11-server-Xorg

(or whatever the package is named in SL 6).

You can examine all the scriptlets in a binary rpm using "-q 
--scripts"; the rpm man page details the funkiness.

I don't think that yum has that level of subtlety, however, so if 
you're committed to it, then you'll have to find a more manual 
workaround.

Several have expressed an interest in my new Froyo Atrx 4G phone. It
will accompany to the meeting f?r das looken sehen und finger poken. In
fact, if I had a mini DVI to standard VGA connector I bet I could put it
on the screen. In fact, it would be fun to experiment with that.

To the best of my knowledge, there is no way to exclude a single
file from being updated.  I'm afraid that making the file
read-only and immutable is probably your best bet.  Yum may pitch
a fit, but it'll just have to live with the situation.  

I would file a bug report with whoever maintains Scientific Linux.
Yum is not supposed to overwrite config files.  If a new config
file is needed, yum will install it, but that file will have a
name ending with ".rmpnew".  Yum should _NEVER_ delete your old
config.  

Sorry I couldn't be of more help.  :-(

=====%<----- snip! ----->%=====

The first thing I'd try is to rename /etc/X11/xorg.conf to
xorg.conf.orig, or something like that, then restart X.  This will
let X generate a new config if it needs one, which it may not.  If
that doesn't work, try the following command, as root:

yum reinstall xorg-\*

That will cause yum to re-install all your existing X11 packages.
Any files that the proprietary Radeon driver has clobbered will be
replaced.  (I had to do this a couple of times swapping between
nVidia's drivers and nouveau.)

Hope this helps.

The only pre/post install script I see that would get executed when
Xorg is upgraded via yum/rpm is in the xorg-x11-server-Xorg package.
The package includes code that could overwrite your xorg.conf file
with an older XF86Config* config file, but only if the permissions on
the xorg.conf file are messed up, specifically if it's modded 000 or
066 (an [ -r xorg.conf ] test would return false and trigger a
subsequent copy operation, see below):

Good point, but AFAIKS, the permissions on the file remained 644
from July 2010 right up until it was modified on February 18.  
Whatever it was, it did it twice, because it also overwrote
xorg.conf.backup (!).  Fortunately, I have nightly backups for
years, and I also make copies of my xorg.conf file, ( i.e.,
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.20100705 ) every time I mod the file.  The
main annoyance was figuring out what was going on.  The subsequent
slow behavior was mostly evident in Firefox, so I spent way too
much time trying to diagnose that. 

I don't like mysteries - if the nightly updates did not do this,
then something nasty is occuring.

Subject: [PLUG] Common as Air
Message-ID: <20110303060634.GA26466@gate.kl-ic.com>

Those of you who still read dead tree documents may enjoy "Open As
Air" by Lewis Hyde, of Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and
Society.  Hyde devotes a lot of ink to one of my heros, Benjamin
Franklin, who had a prescient attitude towards open technology.
I've written about Franklin before, see:
http://www.keithl.com/ben_open.html

It turns out, Franklin invented the open source collaborative
method.  So this posting actually is on topic, and quite germane
to Daniel Hedlund's talk Thursday night.  Lewis excerpts this
last paragraph from Franklin's 1753 letter to Peter Collinson:

 ...
 These thoughts, my dear friend, are many of them crude and hasty;
 and if I were merely ambitious of acquiring some reputation in
 philosophy, I ought to keep them by me, till corrected and improved
 by time and farther experience.  But since even short hints and
 imperfect experiments in any new branch of science, being 
 communicated, have often-times a good effect, in exciting the
 attention of the ingenious to the subject, and so become the 
 occasion of more exact disquisition, and more compleat discoveries.
 You are at liberty to communicate this paper to whom you please;
 it being of more importance that knowledge should increase, than
 that your friend should be thought an accurate philosopher.
                               [ B. Franklin ]

Hmmm ... sounds more like BSD than GPL.  Thought you'd like to know.

Doing a search on Google for the exact text in your email returns two
results, both for the Eschalon Book I game.  One of the two results
gives a solution (YMMV):
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=483839

Are you using any Nvidia drivers, especially on an x86_64 CPU?  If so,
did their recommendation of making sure you have the 32-bit version of
the Nvidia OpenGL libs work for you?  The game is 32-bit and it
appears that running some/most/all 32-bit OpenGL games on x86_64 Linux
distros requires the 32-bit compat libs.  I don't know what distro or
version you're trying to get this working under, so here are some
possibly relevant links:

   What decision criteria should be applied to deciding to use a 64-bit
distribution version rather than a 32-bit version?

   My systems (server/workstation and laptop) almost always have only a
single human user. Depending on the project the work could involve heavy
number crunching (spatial analyses and statistics, terrain and hydrological
modeling) or might be heavy on writing (permit applications). These systems
are 64-bit capable and I don't know if migrating to the 64-bit version will
offer any advantages. I'd like to learn your thoughts on this.

1. Do you need clean access to more than 4 GB RAM? (I don't consider
    PAE "clean" access.)
2. Does the system in question need to be in production past 3:14 am
    on Jan 19, 2038?

If you answer "yes" to either of those questions, then 64-bit is the 
only way to go.

Otherwise, either will suffice. I've had really good luck with 64-bit 
installations on servers and occasional-use laptops, but I haven't had 
a use-every-day Linux workstation in several years (though that will 
change within the next three months).

   That's what I thought, Paul. I was curious and waiting for a 729M file to
download so I thought to check my understanding.

   {if ($2 != 0.000000)
     print $1"|"$2"|"$3}
END {print NR}

to remove lines like this:

29608|0.000000|0.000000

from a file with 110K lines. While I thought it was working properly it
leaves these lines looking like this:

29608||

   I've looked in my O'Reilly sed/awk book and don't see my error. What have
I done incorrectly?

I don't know much about awk, so I won't be able to answer your question.

However, to simply remove whole lines, I would use grep:

grep -v '|0.000000|' [filename]

Hope this is helpful.

If you have 2GB of RAM or less, 32-bit install may be a bit easier.  It'll
probably be smaller (all 64-bit installs require some 32-bit libraries).
Some applications are 32-bit only: many commercial games and things like
Acrobat, but there are also Open Source programs which do not build well on
64-bit architectures (OSS is somewhat behind enterprise commercial software
development here, 64-bit is now often primary supported platform, I'm
beginning to see 32-bit support dropped from heavy-computing tools).

Wes,

   Exceptionally helpful. I discovered that my script does work, but there
are also lines with two pipes that somehow got into the input file. Running
the inverted grep twice fixes this.

Much appreciated,

Rich's awk script only checks the second column for 0.000...  The
following might be more accurate if that was his intended behavior.
grep -v '^[^|]*|0\.000000|' [filename]

...if he wants to continue using awk, I believe the following will
work (the "print NR" was removed):

BEGIN { FS="|" }
  {if ($2 != 0.000000)
    print $1"|"$2"|"$3}
END {}

Fedor,

   My AMD-based server/workstation has 2 cores and 4G RAM; my Intel-based
Dell laptop has 4 cores and 2G RAM. At least they're symetrical. :-)

   I don't do games, but use acroread when xpdf doesn't handle the latest pdf
version. No enterprise-level applications here I don't think. Well, small
enterprises perhaps.

   Tools I use like GRASS, R, LaTeX, PSTricks are not considered heavy

   Yeah. The 'print NR' wasn't working anyway.

Back when I was using it, R was an in-memory statistical tool.  That
is, you needed to load your entire dataset into memory prior to
executing the statistical calculation.  On top of which, the in-memory
representation of the data inflated the in-memory size by a
substantial factor.  64-bit might well have some advantages here.

I am running 64-bit on all my 64-bit capable devices and have yet to
encounter any substantial difficulty.  In the early days, there were
32-bit applications that had some trouble, but these days that case is
pretty well handled by the distributions.

We recently encountered an issue where a particular tool was 64-bit
only, I think maybe the Android SDK, and we (not me personally!) had
installed 32-bit Gentoo on the 64-bit box we'd want to use it on.
Oops.

My advice is, go 64-bit when you can.

Use 64-bit install on that, or you will be limited to effectively using 3G
of RAM (PAE kernel makes better use of the 4G, but still not as good as
64-bit kernel).

Try Okular too, it's still not as good as Acrobat but has better PDF support
than XPDF.

There is a way to run 32-bit Acroread on  64-bit browser, but again mean
installing some 32-bit support libraries and a rather finicky plugin
wrapper. Of course, outside of the browser it's not an issue at all (other
than the extra size of the libraries).

If you need to use NVidia or ATI binary drivers, 64-bit mode brings
additional issue: you usually have to install 32-bit libraries, unless you
really don't use any GL 32-bit programs. Sometimes the path to the 32-bit
library gets dropped from ld config file when driver versions are upgraded.
Of course, you don't notice it until you run the game or other 32-bit
program, then you get some strange error about not being able to initialize
display.

As far as I know all of these have 64-bit ports. I don't know how clean the
port is, but at least it compiles and passed the tests (so they don't do
things like assigning pointers to ints).

Russell,

   I certainly respect your opinions, so I will take your advice when Pat
releases the next Slackware. I'm sure there will be some compatibility
issues with firefox, flash-player (gag!), and such, but those will probably
be worked out.

   Most of my work with R is spatial statistics (although I recently ran the
Mann-Whitney U-test (a.k.a. Wilcoxon test) on a small data set. Perhaps I'll
need to double the RAM in the laptop.

Many thanks,

Use 64-bit if:
* You might have 4+ GB RAM at some point
* You are doing heavy number-crunching (check the benchmarks)

Use 32-bit if:
* You want to use an older distro, and have Flash or other plugins work.
* You have proprietary software that is 32-bit-only
  (you can usually run 32-bit binaries on 64-bit with lib32, but it's hinky)

I'm in the process of eliminating all 32-bit servers in my racks.

Same here. 64-bit server installations have been my default for three 
or four years. Installing a 32-bit Linux on a dedicated server 
requires a clear, uncontestable justification. Installing a 32-bit 
Linux in a virtual server container has a lower bar for justification.

Unfortunately, our Windows servers are still 32-bit because the 
application vendors with whom we do business still recommend them.

I checked and there is no pbx_gtkconsole.so.  How do I get this module?
This is the latest version of asterisk.

Another question, how do I configure Asterisk to expect connections on
port 5060 instead of port 2000?  I have two Linksys PAP2 NA's that I'm
trying to use with my Asterisk server instead of some server out on the
Internet.  If there is a gtk based interface for configuring asterisk,
that would be very much preferred.

Rich,

For what it's worth, I've been running 64-bit Firefox _and_ 64-bit
flash-player for some months now, and it seems to work fine.
(Well, as fine as flash-player ever works, regardless of bittage.
*Phthbthbthbthbt!*)  Before I got a 64-bit version of flash that
worked, I had to load a number of 32-bit libraries so that the
32-bit version would work.  This was on a 64-bit version of Fedora
with 64-bit Firefox.

I have an Athlon dual-core system, with 2 Gig of RAM.  The system
_really_ needs another gig or two, as I wind up chewing up swap
space after a while.  Firefox is rather a memory hog.  Of course,
it doesn't help that I usually have two or three windows open
simultaneously, with six or eight tabs each. :-)  When yum does
an update, it wants a lot of memory, too.

Actually, if you take a look at the recent direction RHEL has been
taking in their kernel patches, you're not too far off:
http://lwn.net/Articles/430600/

But seriously, SL exists basically as a recompilation of RHEL (from
source) done by Fermi Labs, Cern, et al. It effectively is very much
like CentOS, except geared more towards use in Scientifically minded
institutions.

For the most part, like CentOS they remain compatible with upstream.
The one major customization they do make is the ability to create
these things called "sites", which can sort of be thought of as
one-off forks where you might need to make some sort of in-house
modification to the core distro (see
https://www.scientificlinux.org/about/customize). In that regard, you
can think of SL as a base-distro from which you could build a custom
distro from.

Hello,

Well you could go with the latest Mandrake, since you are already familiar
with it.
If you are just running a server and not a desktop environment you might
look into CentOS, which is based on RedHat Enterprise Linux,
or you might also look at Debian.  Ubuntu would work, but it is really
geared towards desktop use, not that it couldn't function as a server.
It is just easier to start off with a lean and mean Debian server than trim
down an Ubuntu installation.

As for filesystem, you can't go wrong with ext4, which I believe most
distros are using as default now.

Ubuntu has a Server version, which is good. But it has no GUI by

the CLI.

I'm looking to partner with G-dly people willing to use the
C++ Middleware Writer -- an on line code generator that
writes C++ marshalling code based on high-level user input.
In exchange for using the C++ Middleware Writer, I'll donate
18 hours/week for six months to their project.  If you aren't
an orthodox Jew or pro-life Christian, you can still get in on
the action.  If you refer someone to me for this, I'll pay you
$150/month for the first four months I work with them.

I'd agree.

It's something like ironic bigotry given the subject of the email, and yeah,
quite offensive, even to someone of neither group.

The offer of money here makes it look a lot like a job offer as Tim noted,
and that makes it look a lot like a violation of employment law...

I agree, Brian Wood's blatant religious discrimination has *absolutely*
no place on this mailing list. Please take the blatantly discriminatory
fundamentalism elsewhere, right now. I also agree that the offer should
be on the plug-jobs list, but I'll also object to discrimination there.

Let me be clear, if you're looking for someone who can help you use the
C++ code generator you're using, that's your only legitimate criterion
that you can legally advertise and use to determine who you might hire.

That also goes for any job posting you might log to the plug-jobs list.

Just to nail this point home, if anyone at all applies for that job you
have just advertised on this mailing list and they have some experience
coding successfully using C++ Middleware Writer but you don't hire them
for whatever reason, they will likely be able to sue you for employment
discrimination - unless they're a member of your own insular Christian
fundamentalist church - and win. Think of legal fees, then losing, too,
and having to pay someone a year or two years' salary for being a jerk.

Unfortunately for you, Woods, you've posted Exhibit A in an employment
discrimination lawsuit on a mailing list that is open to public access.

That means it's likely too late for you to discriminate against people
who might apply for that job, based on whether they share your bigotry.

Have a nice day,
Robert

Message-ID: <20110305124741.2d01af03@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Thinkpad T61, Fedora 14 x86_64. Transcend MicroSD card in SDHC adapter.

I plug the MicroSD card into the adapter and plug the adapter into the
slot in front of the computer. A green light next to the slot lights up
for a moment, then Nautilus pops up a browser window. All looks well,
but when I try to copy files to the card I get:

	Error while copying to "6236-3638".
	The destination is read only.

The adapter has a little slider switch reminiscent of the lock slider
on an ancient floppy disk. I have tried the switch in both positions,
but get the same results. I also tried copying files to it with
Nautilus as root, and from the command line as root. It automounts when
inserted, but I cannot umount it, even as root. 

This is the second SD card from Transcend, and the previous one had the
same problem. I tried the previous one in two different Windows
computers, both of which said the card was defective. I sent it back to
Amazon.

It starts to stretch credibility that I have two bad cards in a row,
and of different form factors as well. I could use some suggestions for
what might be wrong.

So is there anything on it? Can you read from it? Is it formatted?

This is odd, but have you tried to wipe the partitions off and start over
completely?  I would create a new disk label and partitions, just to be
sure.

The only other thing that seems conceivable is that you may have a problem
with the reader in your main computer that is causing damage to the card or
it's partition table.  This could cause the problem to appear on all other
computers you try it in later.

Just a couple of shots in the dark...

It came formatted vfat (according to gParted), and there is nothing on
it. And gParted can't write to it either, so can't reformat.

Thanks for the shots in the dark. 

I have since discovered that it doesn't work in the phone either. That
is, when I inserted it the first time the phone gave a little ringy,
and I could open a file browser window that said at the
top /mnt/sddisk. But being unfamiliar with the Android OS I was unable
to figure out how to copy files to it. I closed the browser window and
subsequently have not been able to get it mounted. If I hook the phone
up to my computer with the USB cable the computer can see the phone,
but the SD Disk folder reports that there is no SD disk inserted.

Nevertheless, every time I insert or remove it the phone emits a little
ringy. It's doing something, but not automounting. 

I'm slowly arriving at the conclusion that Transcend is the wrong brand.

Also can you tell us what /etc/fstab looks like.  There could be
something funny going on in the automount.

I don't get anything very interesting from dmesg. It just notes that it
is automounted read-only, or that I have removed it. Nor do I see
anything exciting in fstab:

	[root at Devil8]# cat /etc/fstab
	# /etc/fstab
	# Created by anaconda on Tue Dec  1 22:52:45 2009
	UUID=3b657fa8-2f02-43ee-98a9-8056bf2bca0f /boot
		ext3  defaults  1  2 
	/dev/mapper/vg_devil8-lv_root /  ext4 defaults  1  1 
	/dev/mapper/vg_devil8-lv_swap swap  swap defaults  0  0
	tmpfs  /dev/shm tmpfs defaults 0  0
	devpts  /dev/pts devpts gid=5,mode=620   0  0
	#devpts options modified by setup update to fix #515521 ugly way
	sysfs   /sys sysfs   defaults   0  0
	proc   /proc   proc defaults 0  0

I don't know what the "ugly way" is. But then, this is Fedora. 

According to dmesg the device name is 6236-3638, so maybe I could add a
line to fstab so it will automount at a specific location (like the
folder I made for it in /media), and as read-write.

I would say it is a permissions issue, except that root can't touch the
thing either. And I mean as # from the command line, not via sudo.

Tomorrow afternoon I am going to take the phone and my computer to the
Activate store at the LLoyd Center where I got the phone. They won't
touch the computer, I am sure, but they should be able to tell me if I
am doing something wrong with the phone, causing the phone not to mount
the card. And if they can get the thing mounted read-write, how I am
supposed to copy files to it. Froyo is still very confusing.

I doesn't look like Ubuntu is using fstab to do the automounting. Your
idea about putting your own entry there is worth a try.

Android has a menu button along the bottom.  When you are looking at
the desktop, this menu button will bring up  a "Settings"  button
which will lead you to the SD Card settings. There is a place in the
SD Card settings  to determine what state the SD card is in and to
format it if needed.

Once it is formatted, you can plug a USB cable from the phone into
your laptop. Now I don't have exactly your phone, but it should be
similar. At that point it will say "USB connected" on the phone, you
will see a new icon on the status bar. You can pull down the status
bar, click on the USB Connected item and say "Turn on USB Storage".
Shortly thereafter your laptop will see the phone as a USB storage
device and you can mount it and copy files to it.

You could also physically move the SD card back and forth, but
mounting it via a USB cable is quicker.

I know a bit about fstab, but not enough to know how to write the line.
I read man fstab, but it didn't help.

Several layers deep in the settings menu it shows "SD card and phone
storage." Under "SD card" it lists "Total space," "Available space,"
"Mount SD card," and "Format SD card." All are grayed out.

After removing and reinserting the SD card the top menu has a little
squarish icon. Pulling down the top menu I see an entry "The SD card is
safe to remove." This is immediately after reinserting it. 

I think the phone is not automounting it, or is mounting it and
instantly umounting it. I wonder if the Froyo that came with the phone
has been hacked by AT&T so it requires a microSD card sold by AT&T.
Maybe that is a paranoid thought.

I haven't moved the device to the phone yet, but I have suddenly had
success on the laptop. Fedora 14 had its usual periodic updates, and
this time it required a reboot. I put the microSD card in its adapter
and into the slot in the front of the Thinkpad, and then rebooted. I
had done this before without success, but this time suddenly I am able
to read to the device. 

I am copying a lot of mp3s to the card. When I finish (tomorrow
sometime) I will see what happens when I put it in the phone. 

Please y'all, keep your fingers crossed.

I wasn't paying attention. In fact, the card is in the phone at the
moment and I am transferring files to it from the laptop over USB. 

I still don't understand why it sometimes mounts, sometimes mounts as
read-only, and sometimes doesn't mount at all.

Well, I filled it up with the card in the phone using the USB
connection. It worked reasonably quickly, considering that the card is
only Class 2. It continues to work in the phone, although sometimes
apps don't see it correctly. For example, the media player announces
"SD card not available," and then proceeds to show and play all the
files on it anyway. 

However, when I put the card in the adapter and slide it into my Fedora
14 Thinkpad it still always automounts as read-only. I haven't figured
out how to fix that, but since I now have it filled up with music it
matters only out of curiosity.

The phone will say "SD card not available" if you have it mounted as a
USB device on the laptop. Either the phone has control or the laptop
has control. They both can't see the SD card at the same time. Is that
what you are seeing?

If the phone and Ubuntu are both having  trouble with the SD Card
maybe it still has problems with formatting/partitioning. Is the
formatting still grayed out in the SD card settings on the phone.
If not, you could have the phone format it again. You will lose your
mp3's, but you can copy them back. If it is not stable you might lose
them anyway  at some inopportune time.

This page might shed light on the problem
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount/USB
Particularly the section titled
USB-Device is, or become suddenly read only without errors

The music player app says "SD card not available" always. I finished
copying the files via USB last night and the phone has not been
connected to the computer since. Yet it still says "SD card not
available."

Under SD Card in Settings "total space," "available space," and "format
SD card" are grayed out. The only one lit up is "unmount SD card." But
if I unmount it then "mount SD card" and "format SD card" become
available. 

I unmounted it, but then I decided not to follow through and reformat
it. But after mounting it again the music player no longer says it is
unavailable. 

The computer is Fedora, not Ubuntu, and it still mounts it as
read-only. I care only because I'd like to get another regular size SD
card and just leave it in the laptop as additional storage. But there
seems to be a problem with the card reader in Fedora 14.

Could be it needs a new battery?  Batteries are usually pretty low cost 
... take it to a battery store and have it tested ... could take the UPS 
in for testing as well

I assume you don't mean the normal "beep beep" it would make on purpose.

If it's more of an EEEEEEEEE, with maybe some change in pitch, I'd guess
that one of the capacitors has blown or something else is wrong with the
inverter electronics, and it's toast.

It's also a fire hazard, so UNPLUG IT NOW.

The pasted information above is the content in sip.conf.  What do I add
for the FXS ports on the Digium card connected to the Asterisk server?
What file do I program on the Asterisk server to give the FXS ports
say extensions 2004 and 2005?  Two phone lines are connected to the
FXO ports, what do I tweak to work with those?  First I want to
establish a completely private phone system, calling out is something
for later and I may want to do things like block long distance,
etcetera.

In the UPS world, I have always tried to say with APC, although I have 
had good service from TripLite and IBM brands as well.  Are you sure you 
only want a surge protection for your computer setup?  Where I am the 
incoming power is pretty dirty ... maybe yours is clean?

If all you want is a surge protector, go to Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th,
97214. I got a couple of them there for a buck apiece.

Can someone translate this HOWTO for people using FreePBX instead of

GUIs are supposed to make configuring something easier, but I am about
to give the FreePBX people an F for theirs.

Subject: [PLUG] Asterisk help needed...
Message-ID: <20110309184635.pq56rkr5wk4wsocg@web.robinson-west.com>

I have a TDM410P analog digium card with 2 FXS and 2 FXO ports.  I  
configured Asterisk manually to work with 2 Linksys PAP2's unlocked  
locally.  So I don't think I want FreePBX, Trixbox, Asterisk-GUI, or  
any other gui as I haven't determined how to do the exact same thing  
using them.  I manually configured sip.conf, voicemail.conf, and  
extensions.conf and I have a local phone/voice mail system working.

The analog digium card is plugged into power and a PCI slot.  The blue  
lights are lit and the POTS line from CenturyLink is connected to FXO  
port 1 where the POTS line from my Comcast cable modem is connected to  
FXO port 2.  I am waiting on an analog telephone handset to plug in to  
one of the FXS ports where I'm not certain what I should use the other  
FXS port for.

My plan is to at least get the local phone system to ring one of the  
FXS ports and vice versa.  This will allow me to move my second PAP2  
out of the house since the server will then be able to replace it.   
Following this, I want to program the FXO ports not to answer the  
phone but to allow me to call out.  I want to allow local calls  
through either POTS line from the PAP2's or the FXS ports.

sip.conf:

[general]

Is anyone running a fairly current Linux kernel (2.6.26 or close) and using
a Logitech or Creative web cam? I'm ooking to buy a web cam today locally
and hook it up to my Debian Sid install. I found a how-to that says all I
need to do is install gspca-source and camorama which seems straight forward
enough. So I'm just curious what other user's experience has been with Linux
and specific web cams and if it was easy/painful and what apps are you using
it with. Skype, Gmail voice/video chat, etc.

TIA for you feedback!

Buy this webcam:
http://www.frys.com/product/6432542?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG
Hercules DualPix HD

or the higher end versions of it if you want their features. At least on
Fedora 12 (2.6.32) I just plug it in, hotplug loads the right module, and
Google chat in Firefox or Chrome detects the camera (microphone is also
detected by audio applications like audacity). I did not have to configure
anything at all.

I have had good luck with Logitech web cams.  We used one for my son's
science fair experiment to make time-lapse movies of slugs.  We found
a reference to "Cheese" as an is-it-working kind of ap.  We used
"motion" for the time-lapse.  I've used it with Skype as well.  Works
good!

My first web cam was an Intel thing, I got it for $5 at a garage sale,
and it never worked right.

I'm using a Logitech QuickCam on Ubuntu 10.04, Linux 2.6.32-29.

Bus 006 Device 002: ID 046d:08d7 Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Communicate STX

You may be able to see it via camserv, here:

  http://tdired.dyndns.org:8080

I don't really use it much, though it has worked over skype and for
capturing some video with xawtv.

The issue I had with both Logitech and Creative webcams was that some of
them work and very similar ones don't. You have to know the USB ID to be
sure, but you can't check USB ID in the store on online. Also, USB IDs
published online tend to go obsolete, soon you won't be able to buy a webcam
with that ID even if you could check it. There will be a new ID, which may
work, but is not yet listed as working.

I use a Logitech Quickcam Communicate STX with Unbuntu 10.04, 2.6.32. It 
uses V4L1 and reports as a UVC camera on /dev/video0. I use it with 
Skype, WebCamStudio and Kopete, no special requirements or settings. 
Cheese doesn't record video well at all, but then it doesn't with my 
netbook's built-in camera.

Yeah, I never had any luck *recording* video from cheese, it usually records
some half-corrupted garbage.  I do use it to test the webcams by viewing the
video.

Sound like a neat project.  Can you give more details or a link to
more details about how you did the project?

Based on your feedback and what I've read in Linux forums I think I'm going
to give the Logitech Quickcam from my local computer store a try. I'll let
you all know how it works out. Thanks again!

Make sure the store takes it back if needed. I've had very similar Logitech
Quickcams work and not work at all.

   I have a Logitech Quickcam (don't remember the model off the top of my
head) and could not get it to work with Ekiga (which is why I bought it.
Finally gave up the effort.

The slug part or the time-lapse part?

For the time-lapse part, I have a .motion configuration file like so:

  videodevice /dev/video0
  height                          480
  width                           640
  quality                         90
  snapshot_interval       1
  minimum_frame_time      1
  ffmpeg_timelapse        1
  ffmpeg_timelapse_mode   daily

Then go to a fresh directory and type the command:

  motion -c ~/.motion

and away you go.  I suppose you could read the manpage as well.  With
that config, you get individual jpegs every second as well as a
concatention of the frames into an mpeg movie.

I did something like this for a "security" camera when the family was
out of town for a week last summer and I wanted to keep an eye on the
side yard, only with a 5 second sampling interval.  Was nice to keep
track of the house and the nice Portland weather (we were sweltering
on the east coast).

Motion has other cool features as well.

there is not exactly an official PLUG chat room, but there is a generic

The only rule is that there are no rules.

#orlug is listed on the plug site, not sure about affiliation. #debian 
is a good place to get help, #linuxoutlaws is good for lots of

Subject: [PLUG] Recommended Routers
Message-ID: <4D7AD221.3060205@comcast.net>

I had some connect problems today that came and went, and finally went. 
I called the Comcast tech support line and, after an automated attempt 
at resetting my modem -- which included their computer asking me to 
unplug my router! -- I still couldn't connect to the Internet. So their 
phone computer connected me to a helpful tech support guy. We went 
through the same process of resetting the modem from their end (I had 
tried power cycling myself before I called) but it didn't help. Then he 
had me disconnect the router and connect one of my computers directly. 
After he again reset the modem, I was connected. He then had me 
reconnect the router, and he reset the modem, and everything worked.

His surmise was that the router was failing. In his experience they only 
last 2-3 years. Mine has lasted over 10 years. It is a Netgear RT-314. 
If he is correct, then I've had plenty of good service and shouldn't be 
too concerned about having to replace it. If they are as reliable as 
switches, then I'm not surprised. I've had to replace a couple of those 
over the years.

So, my question: What routers are you folks using that you're happy with?


TIA for recommendations.

I hate netgear and linksys seems to generally get better over time. I'm
unthrilled with the way cisco (which owns linksys now) kind of shirked their
open source responsibilities, but that doesn't change that the hardware
works well.

For clearer perspective, I'm in the IT manager in a company employing about
300 people who work at home on a VOIP phone. Each of them have a router of
their own choosing and I get to deal with all the various brands of
weirdness that each one brings. None have been perfect, but Netgears have
been the worst and Linksys' have been the .... well, least bad.

as a contrasting opinion, i've had 2 linksys wrt54g2 routers go bad on 
me in 2 1/2 yrs. i recently picked up a DLink Xtreme N for $79 at Fry's 
(http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=530), and have been very impressed 
w/ the admin UI, feature set, signal strength, etc. both of the 
wrt54g2's i had would routinely drop clients who were transferring large 
amounts of data, and i haven't had that problem since getting this new 
router.

this is the first non-linksys i've owned, as my first linksys, the 
wrt54g, was solid enough to inspire some brand loyalty, but 2 duds in a 
row sent me looking elsewhere. the dlink has yet to stand the test of 
time, but initial impressions are very favorable.

anyways, good hunting.

regards,

nathan

Thanks for reminding me that I already have two more routers sitting on 
a shelf! I got one when I bought my DVR, since it needed a network 
connection and I didn't have an Ethernet cable near the TV. I have since 
installed three drops of CAT5 cable and took that wrt54g out of service. 
Then, I acquired another wrt54g from my sister who no longer needed it.

I know both of them work, so when the Netgear finally gives up for good, 
I can install one of the the wrt54gs.

Thanks again.

Thanks. I appreciate the perspective. This Netgear router has worked 
well for as long as I've had cable Internet, which goes back to when it 
was first offered in Oregon City. I know that's over 10 years, but don't 
recall how much over 10 years. On the other hand, I know that past 
performance is no guarantee of future reliability, so Netgear may no 
longer be worth considering.

automating the process of whois lookups and regex'ing the registrar name 
is fairly straightforward, but asking for the data even from the gtld 
servers we run into a cap due to api restrictions (~250 requests/hr).

any ideas as to resources we could ask for this information and be able 
to get the answers in a quick-ish (no more than a couple hours) fashion?

thanks in advance.

For additional context, Michael asked this question a couple times
earlier last year:
http://www.mail-archive.com/plug at lists.pdxlinux.org/msg04467.html
http://www.mail-archive.com/plug at lists.pdxlinux.org/msg05506.html

It's apparently an ISA-based sound card and he was getting Kernel
oopses at the time...


Michael,

What has changed on your end since last year?  It appears you've
upgraded to a newer version of slackware (10.1 -> 13.1) and I assume
the kernel is no longer oopsing like it was before?  Did you ever
follow Wes's suggestions regarding looking into the BIOS or swapping
out the board that provides a PCMCIA port with another sound card?

If Slackware is detecting and setting up the sound card for you, is
there something wrong with how it's currently doing it?  What error
messages are you seeing?

What command are you using the load the module by hand?  Are you
specifying the IRQ and I/O address manually (i.e. modprobe opti93x
io=... irq=...) or are you relying on isapnp?

Can you provide any relevant snippets from programs or files such as
dmesg, lspci, /etc/isapnp.conf, lsmod, sndstat or alsaconf?  If your
version of ALSA is new enough, you might be able to get most of this
info by running "alsa-info" instead.


Cheers,

Daniel Hedlund

I'm using Asterisk 1.8 where my search for documentation on how to
configure FXO/FXS ports is proving fruitless.  I'm talking the TDM 410
I have installed with 2 FXS modules and 2 FXO modules.  I have two
Linksys PAP2's soon to be three that I figured out how to connect
together via the Asterisk server as a private intercom system.  I
want to connect the FXS ports, at least one of them, to this private
intercom system.  Apparently, there will be a book in April by O'Reilly
that will deal with this newer version of Asterisk.  I'd rather not wait
till April.

So my simple phone system required creation of my own sip.conf,
extensions.conf, and voicemail.conf files.  One thing I want to
change is I want to increase the number of rings to 8 for the
voicemail to answer.  Currently after 4 rings the system goes to
voicemail.  I could try disabling voicemail, it isn't really 
needed for an intercom system.

Before asking world wide

I may soon have a VXI based instrument to play with. Anyone locally
have experience with
running Linux on a VXI CPU, and or know what choices are there for
using Linux vs the dreaded  Windoz ?

CPUs that are affordable are x86, 68000, and Sparc based.

The VXI interface/API would be the show stopper.

My interest would be replace having to use GPIB via a GPIB/VXI bridge
with Ethernet.

The part that answers your question, apparently.

> Try googling this yourself before telling me that google has the answer.

I did.  Are you saying I lied?

I used to build and support Asterisk servers professionally.  You have
access to FAR more (and better) documentation than I ever did.

Look to the documentation that comes with the installation packages, and
the HOWTOs and Wikis on the net. Look at the supplied example configs.
Heck, steal configs from a click-n-drool Asterisk appliance.

If you can string words together to ask a bunch of other people to do your
thinking for you, and enough reading comprehension to understand their
replies, you can figure out how to configure Asterisk channels.

It is very dangerous to let other people do your thinking for you,

Subject: [PLUG] How to find a program's name
Message-ID: <20110317184340.5eb1e49f@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I just installed an RPM downloaded from Sourceforge:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ltc/

In installed it with "#rpm --install <package>." The command executed
without error, so I assume it is installed. Unfortunately, the author
of the program provided a PDF for documentation which starts assuming
that you have launched the application. I can't launch it because it
did not create a launcher in Gnome, nor do I know the name of the
program to launch it from the command line.

There is probably a way to find the name of installed packages,
preferably by specifying the *.rpm name, but I don't know what it is.

Suggestions welcome!

Has anyone else encountered this? I've read a few forums about how the Skype
alsa-oss implementation is horrible. Combine that with the myriad of Linux
audio sub-systems. What's odd is that even when I'm not running Skype I
can't get any other source of audio to play. I don't really care to dig into
this mess though. I'll just deal with it or maybe run Skype on a MS WIN box.

Yes, it's this Sunday again, March 20, 2011. It's at Free Geek, 1741 SE
10th Avenue in Portland, a couple blocks south of the Hawthorne Lucky
Lab.

Bring your computer that you want to install Linux on, and we'll walk
you through it. Generally all you need to bring is the box; we have
mice, keyboards and monitors. Leave that other OS behind, or install
Linux as a dual boot!

Or bring your Linux computer that's being a brat. We'll debrat it for
you!

Or just come to look over shoulders to see what Linux is all about.
You're welcome even if you haven't started with Linux yet. 

If you are a Linux guru, come and help the less fortunate! Help is
always welcome!

Added SPECIAL ATTRACTION!!

John will bring his new Android phone and demonstrate how Android
works. Even if you know Linux, the Android user interface is a challenge
to get your head around. Find out the basics of the Android OS. And if
there are other Android gurus, maybe we'll even undertake rooting
John's phone!

Subject: [PLUG] Linux Security/Audit Guest Instructor
Message-ID: <AANLkTikNZY2z1eyPWdX09wDKFpzFWO8TA+qrk6bqrPg6@mail.gmail.com>

I am an IT audit Manager and have been studying/learning Linux for about two
years (in my limited spare time). I am also a member of the Willamette
Valley chapter of ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association)
and a CISA. ISACA is the organization that oversees the CISA (Certified
Information Systems Auditor) and related certifications. Once per month, our
local chapter has a luncheon at which a volunteer guest speaker comes and
presents a technical topic related to IT audit. The total time for the lunch
is 1.5 hours and the seminar portion lasts about an hour.

The reason I'm explaining all of this is I believe Linux is
under-represented at these technical luncheons. Would any of you be
interested in being a guest instructor at one of these luncheons? Topics
should be related to linux security, audit, vulnerabilities, etc. -
basically, anything that could help an IT Auditor better perform their job
with respect to Linux servers. I realize that one hour is not a lot of time.
However, these luncheons occur monthly, so ideally a Linux series (e.g.
Linux Audit & Security Part1, Part2, etc.) may be an option. Otherwise a
single seminar is certainly better than nothing.

Thoughts?

   Nope. Haven't enquired yet. For all I know they'll take care of it and I
need do nothing here. That's what I'd like to determine: do I do anything at

Very interesting!  I've been working on PCI SAQ D compliance at my
organization for the past year and am in the middle of implementation at
the moment.  We're a level 4 merchant, so no auditing is necessary, but I'm
acting like it is.

My approach has been based on Linux and open-source software all the way.

I like to give talks but I'm too lazy about preparation and usually need a
boot in the ass to do a good job.  I'd love to collaborate with 1-2 other
PLUGgers on a talk or series.

I'm not familiar enough with the scope or nature of your associates' work
to judge what would be the most appropriate topics, maybe a short meeting
with you and some PLUGgers is in order.

I go to the local web page for it and when I check the stats there is

I've been trying to go through the instructions, but that hasn't been

   I have several dozens of client spreadsheets (all Excel, of course) with
about 30 years' worth of compliance monitoring data. Different operators
over the years and absolutely no standards for data organization or page
structure. Or anything else.

   To import these data into postgres for statistical analyses with R I need
to code missing values (blank cells) as NA (not available). I could do this
after exporting the page as a .csv file, but wondered if there was a way to
have the search field in "Find & Replace" blank the way we can have the
replace field blank to remove cruft.

Thanks,

Rich

>From OO.o's wiki page on Find & Replace for Calc:
"Searching for the regular expression ^$ will not find empty cells.
This is intentional?the rationale being to avoid performance issues
when selecting a huge number of cells. Note that empty cells will not
be found even if you are only searching a selection."
(http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOo3_User_Guides/Calc_Guide/Find_and_replace)

It doesn't look like you can search for a blank cell in calc.

There's a really cool open source project for managing just this kind
of problem (cleaning up data) called "Google Refine" (they bought
Freebase and released refine as open source).  The introduction videos
act as great tutorial.
http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/

Although you have to download and run it locally, it's pretty easy,
usually just something like:
$> tar -zxvf google-refine-2.0-r1836.tar.gz
$> cd google-refine-2.0
$> ./refine

Disclaimer: I am a master with Writer, but have launched Calc less than
a hundred times in my entire life. Take what I say with a whole shaker
of salt.

Calc can be macroed along the same lines as Writer. I love to use
macros in Writer because I can just record the keystrokes and clicks -
lots easier for those of us who are code challenged. I've even manually
modified the code on occasion, e.g., where I needed to do successive
search and replaces in a specific order. In such a case I just recorded
the first search and replace, then copied and pasted the search part of
the code for as many things as I needed to search for, modifying each
one for the specific string. 

Of course, you can write your macros completely manually if you like. I
am thinking of a macro that would search for an empty cell and replace
it with "NA." In the process you could also set the cell properties to,
e.g., text instead of numeric. If you run the macro on a file with lots
of empty cells it might take a while to run, but that's frequently just
right for a trip to the coffeepot. It would certainly be faster than
doing it one at a time manually.

You might also see if you can Select All, and then deselect the ones
containing data, followed by a paste of "NA." I think the tricky part
would be to figure out what you need to say in the macro for "if
empty." I know in Writer ^$ returns an empty paragraph, but I don't
know how to specify an empty cell in a spreadsheet.

I believe that, instead of using the default OOo Basic, you can write
macros in python, and possibly other languages.

Near the bottom of your keyboard, slightly to the right of center,
there is a rounded square shaped piece of plastic that moves
perpendicular to the plane of the keyboard, marked "N".  After
pressing that, look to the left side of the keyboard to find a similar
piece of plastic marked "A".

Obviously there is the "type it in answer" ... but maybe that's not what 
your are looking for?  Are you looking for something in the "Find and

Oh, that is what I feared ... no way in OOo (or Excel, I think) to do 
that ... think of all the blank cells outside of your scope of 
interest.  Best done with SED or EX in the *.CSV file, I should think.
Hope that helps

I found here:

http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=948

This:

Another is to turn the problem on its head. Lets say the last cell of 
your sheet is E345. (You can find this by doing a CTL+END). Create a new 
sheet put "." in A1 and copy the cell. In the range selection box 
(that's the one next to f(x)) type A1:E345 and hit enter. Now hit CTL-V 
and paste. You have now A1:E345 filled with dots. Now go the the 
original CSV download. CTL-END then CTL-SHIFT_HOME to select the entire 
contents; copy it and toggle over to the new dotty sheet. Now do a Space 
Special (CTL-SHIFT-V) and check the "Skip Empty Cells" box. Job done. I 
know its a manual exercise but it only takes 15 secs or so.

Replace the '.' (dot) with NA.

May be more work than you really want but I couldn't find an option to 
display NA in empty cells in LibreOffice so I doubt it is in OOo either.

   Regex search-and-replace in emacs does it, too.

Thanks, Fred,

Daniel,

   Thanks. I'll take a look.

   I'll probably have to write individual python scripts for each page
exported as a .csv (or .txt) file to re-arrange the data.

Pretty cool stuff.  Still for a number of CSV files with the same issue 
(replace ,"", with ,"NA",), a single SED file could be run against all 
the files ... could even be dropped into a simple script to do each file 
in a loop, preserving naming conventions.
But I do like that one ... I tested it and it does work.

Just wondering instead of placing a '.', why not place 'NA', then paste

If you interrogate a cell with ISBLANK a blank returns TRUE.  Can this be
put in a macro to go through all cells to replace those returning TRUE with
the desired text?  Alternatively you could duplicate the sheet to another
 with =IF(ISBLANK(sheet1:C3),"NA",sheet1:C3) in each corresponding cell (C3
is just an example).  Then do a copy/paste special values to get the
required sheet.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1103221321310.24157@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have a text file whose rows are formatted like this:

BC-2:2009-02-15:Flow:150.00:ft/sec:Temperature (field):7.40:oF:Conductance,
Specific:2058.00:umhos/cm:pH:7.40:Std Units

Specific:1224.00:umhos/cm:pH:8.14:Std Units
BC-3:2009-02-15:Flow:326.00:ft/sec:Temperature (field):7.80:oF:Conductance,
Specific:576.50:umhos/cm:pH:7.40:Std Units

and I need to have them split into multiple rows. Each row would have field
#1, a colon separator, field #2, a colon separator, then the parameter name,
measured value, and units. A job for awk!

   Unfortunately, despite my referring to the ORA sed & awk book, my attempts
to write a one-line script that uses a newline '\n' to split the lines
throws an error. The script:

# This script takes spreadsheet exports from single lines per location/data to
# one line per location, date, and parameter.

FS=":"

{print $1':'$2':'$3':'$4':'$5\n$1':'$2':'$6':'$7':'$8\n$1':'$2':'$9':'$10':'$11\n$1':'$2':'$12':'$13':'$14}

produces this error message:

awk: reform.awk:6: {print
$1':'$2':'$3':'$4':'$5\n$1':'$2':'$6':'$7':'$8\n$1':'$2':'$9':'$10':'$11\n$1':'$2':'$12':'$13':'$14}
awk: reform.awk:6:          ^ invalid char ''' in expression

   I'm sure the caret will be mis-aligned when you read this.

   Please tell me what I've missed.

If your ISP supports v6 to your box, they'll be handing you a /48 pretty
soon.

If not, look into tunnelbroker.net, and get yourself your own /48 for
free.

Try 'printf' instead of print ...

{printf "%s:%s:%s:%s\n%s:%s:%s:%s:%s\n%s:%s:%s:%s:%s\n%s:%s:%s:%s:%s\n",$1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$1,$2,$6,$7,$8,$1,$2,$9,$10,$11,$1,$2,$12,$13,$14}


... if I haven't miscounted or something,  And yes, I treated all values 
as strings, although that may not be what you want/have to do.
Hope that helps

Fred,

   As was pointed out to me replacing the single quotes with double quotes
and adding double quotes to the newlines fixed the problem. I've been
working with SQL as I get these data in the table and got turned around on
when to use single quotes and when to use double quotes.

Thanks,

Rich

Just to make user, your example is 3 lines ?

give an example of what you want the output to be for the first data
line in your example

the reason I ask is in your sample the data is colon sep'ed.

Just to make user, your example is 3 lines ?

give an example of what you want the output to be for the first data
line in your example

the reason I ask is in your sample the data is colon sep'ed.

Good ... yes that will work as well, as long as you can keep track of 
when to escape these special characters (quotes, for example).
However ... since you are working with SQL to extract the data in the 
first place, you could just format the data as required and skip the AWK 
step altogether, could you not?

Fred,

   Nope. I did not clearly explain. I have dozens of Excel spreadsheets with
a total of about 17 years worth of data. There were/are no standards for
organizing each sheet, what data are placed where, the names of parameters
and units, or anything else. Total data anarchy; a horrible mess that
requires me to wear hip waders as I go through the process of taking each
sheet (first saved as an .ods file) to .csv then input into a postgres
table.

   The SQL is to check that there are no attribute inconsistencies, check my
progress (45.5K rows so far), and make sure everything is working.

The same in perl:

echo "BC-2:2009-02-15:Flow:150.00:ft/sec:Temperature

   Yep.

   It also works if I put the field separator spec in a BEGIN section. That's
what it needed.

Hello Ladies and Gentlemen,

I am writing today because I am getting desperate.  I just received my
Associates degree in CIS: Network Administration. For the life of me, I
can't find a position.  I have over 10 years of experience troubleshooting
computer systems.  I am "up-to-date" about all things tech...(as much as I
can be.)  I'm also a pretty nice guy to boot!

I am reaching out to the PLUG network to ascertain any information about
open positions that you may be aware of.  For those with IT positions as a
day job, I am willing to volunteer one weeks time to get some experience
under my belt.  My resume can be sent by request to email in PDF or .DOC
format. If you have any suggestions please by all means, I welcome your
expertise.

If you know of any position in the IT field.  I am looking for any position
from Jr. Network admin to desktop support tech.  I am mostly familiar with
windows.  I do know some things about Linux/Unix...just not enough to really
quantify as "professional," yet.  I have been experimenting with a VM of
Fedora 14.  Anyways, I would appreciate any and all information.

Thank you
Dave Johnson

Subject: [PLUG] Is there a russian romance scam?
Message-ID: <1301034774.2942.60.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I'm getting email from fili_olga at yahoo.com .

The emails include lovely pictures of a woman who claims to be Russian.

So far, all I have to go on is that I have received a few emails from
this person, bot, whatever where the story so far seems to be
reasonable.  I've tried to suggest another medium to verify what I'm
being told, Skype perhaps.  I'm wondering if anyone else has received
email where they are told to reply to fili_olga at yahoo.com ?

What can I do considering that email is completely untrustworthy to
verify or refute what these messages say?

The woman, assuming this is a Russian woman in Russia, is supposedly a
teacher who wants to come to the U.S. on a special work abroad program.
The claim she makes is that she has no opportunity in Russia.  Another
thing she says is that she wants to make a friend before she comes to
the US.  She evidently wants to stay in the US long term.

I've emailed back to the address given that I have concerns such as,
I can't verify that you are who you say you are, etcetera.

Yeah or nay, sharing pictures is a good idea or a bad one?  I offered
her a picture of myself and a very old picture of family.  I did not
tell her in me message the family members' names.  I figure I could have
a page up on the web with family photos.

I asked her if she really is a teacher and suggested she come up with
ideas on how we can verify the stories going back and forth without
endangering ourselves.

This email exchange is exciting, but I'm worried that it could be
dangerous.  What options do I have to make sure that this isn't some
clever scam?  If this is a scam, what is the goal of the con?

This is indeed a very popular scam. If you want to verify, start putting
random phrases from "her" email in quotes on google. If a bunch of people
got the same email, it's very unlikely to be legitimate.

I've noticed a sharp increase in my spambox lately of "Russian women"
looking to meet American men.

The goal is usually to get you to sign up for some website where you can
find more info or pictures or some such. Could be anything though.

to rephrase the question:

"can i trust the contents of this unsolicited email, from someone in a
foreign country, and should i give out personal information to a total
stranger?"

common sense says no. if you're getting a kick out of exchanging emails,
though, go for it, but be careful to CYA.

Subject: [PLUG] Setting up Linksys WRT54GL
Message-ID: <20110325192034.0a8f7313@mailhost.pdx.edu>

My home is all ethernet, so I have never bothered with wireless
devices. However, I now desire to set up a recently acquired Linksys
WRT54GL so that only my laptop and phone can connect. The laptop
normally sits in its mini-dock where it is connected via ethernet,
but I want it to connect to wireless in case I want to take it to
another part of the house. The phone and my laptop are my only wireless
devices. 

I started by doing a factory reset, since I acquired it used. Then I set
it up with a cable to the input port on the WRT54GL to my D-Link router,
which is 192.168.0.1. Then I connected a cable from one of the other
four ports on the WRT54GL to my 16-port switch that connects to the
wall outlets in the house. Nice flashy lights all around. From my Fedora
laptop Firefox brings up the web administration page at
http://192.168.1.1. My laptop and my phone both see it as well (as
"linksys"), and can connect, although the phone can't go anywhere at
all and the laptop can't go anywhere if I disconnect the ethernet.

There are a zillion settings on the web administration pages, and I
don't understand most of them. I have the MAC address of the phone, and
I suppose ifconfig will give me similar information for the laptop. I'd
like to set it up so that the WRT54GL will give automatic permission to
just the phone and the laptop, and perhaps password authentication if I
want to let someone else into it temporarily.

I have spent an hour fiddling with the web administration pages, but
can't get it working. I need help from someone familiar with the
settings for a WRT54GL router. Anyone willing to help a dummy?

I suggest putting www.polarcloud.com/tomato on it.  Tomato works better and
is easier than stock.  My WRT54GL has been running Tomato for years.  I
found enough info online to get mine going, although it took several hours.

DDR2 512 MB

Next time someone brings in an undernourished laptop we will be able to

In case someone needs RAM, they had 20 sticks or so of each in stock.
They charged me $5 each for the DDRs and a buck apiece for the PC100s.

Subject: [pdx-groups] Mark your calendars! PDX11 Civic Unconference
April 1 and 2
To: pdxgroups at googlegroups.com


Hi!

We're having a civic unconference April 1 (starting 5pm) and April 2
(9am-6pm-ish)

We've got sponsors providing food and drink both days, and lots of
projects lined up for hackery on the 2nd. Hope to see you there!

Please distribute!

-selena

======

Join us April 1-2 for the PDX11 Civic Unconference. Please RSVP!

http://pdx11unconference.eventbrite.com/

This community meeting is open to all!

Since the inaugural PDX11 meeting in December 2010, three teams have
been working separately to meet their goals. Everyone will reconvene
on April 1-2 for the PDX11 Civic Unconference to bring the teams back
together to share, discuss and hack on the software that supports the
goals of PDX11.

Each team will present their charter and discuss their initial
findings regarding available resources and the management tools needed
to bring it all together.

PDX11 is also assembling developers in the Hackathon community to work
on several key pieces of software including: Calagator, ePDX.org,
CivicApps inspired projects like PDXAPI, and open source Trimet data
processing applications. They also need developers who can pair up and
hack codes like Ruby, Python, PHP and Javascript. Non-technical work
includes documentation of resources, blogging, data entry, testing,
and feature requests.

We put together a detailed Q&A here: http://pdx11.org/node/2919

You'll find out:
* Where to RSVP?
* Where will this event be held?
* Why should I attend?
* Well, if an unconference isn't planned out ahead of time, what can I
expect to hear about if I attend?
* Where can I find out more about the Hackathon?
* What is PDX11 about again?
* When will this event take place?
* What is an unconference exactly?
* Can I get a more detailed schedule?

And there's an RSVP page so we can plan for food & drink:

http://pdx11unconference.eventbrite.com/

We are also seeking sponsors! Please contact me if your company is
willing to pitch in.

Thanks!

you can put tomato or another aftermarket firmware on it, but this is
probably not ideal in your situation. From what I've seen, you subscribe to
the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" school, which means you are unlikely
to be willing to replace your D-Link with the Linksys. This means you're
going to end up with 2 routers on 1 network - this is a path to problems.
There are a couple of options.

For simplicity, I advise putting the Linksys in place of the D-Link. You can
configure it however you want.

Since you're not going to do that, what you need to do is use the Linksys as
a switch rather than a router. The way to do this is to leave the Internet
(or input) port empty, and connect the Linksys to the D-Link on one of the
numbered LAN ports. Use the Linksys' configuration webpage to change its
local IP to 192.168.0.something, preferably something you can remember, like
2. Then, turn OFF its internal DHCP server. Now it will act just like a
wireless switch.

As far as wireless security, MAC address based lockdowns are useless. You
can set a WPA password and put that into the phone and laptop.

Subject: [PLUG] Algorithm's and Compilers PSU...
Message-ID: <1301112340.6234.33.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

Anyone on here pass Mark Jone's Algorithms class this Winter at PSU?
How about Jingke Li's course on Compilers?

I tried, but I couldn't grasp well enough the material covered by the
homework assignments in CS350.  Going back this Spring, I wonder what
I'm in for in Introduction to Operating Systems as far as the Algorithms
material is concerned?

There was no reference material to speak of for JavaCC, yet we were
expected to program with it.  Jingke has received a free copy of a 
book I bought half way through the term or so on JavaCC, but I don't
know how that will affect the course in the future.  I'm worried 
that I don't know how to form a grammar after figuring out tokens 
where I don't think my book on JavaCC covers this.

I guess my concern is, if this was the math department at PSU there
would be high quality tutoring available where the CS department
seems to have nothing to speak of.  At the professional level, the
senior level and above, it is extremely frustrating to have to retake
courses.  Worse, I am out of sequence right now for classes that are
only available at certain times in the year.  I'm disgusted with the
response I've gotten, not from Barbara who is a great adviser, but 
from the person above her asking about tutoring and what is both
possible and allowed.  I got treated like I want to cheat.  This 
almost makes me want to leave PSU for good and take my chances
elsewhere.

Long term, does anyone on here have an idea how I can secure high
quality help?  In other words, if you were pursuing a CS degree at 
PSU, how on earth would you get the information you'll need to do 
this in a reasonable amount of time for a reasonable price?

Mark is a very demanding teacher, a foreign teacher, and perhaps for
that reason an unrealistic teacher for an actual Oregonian.  I'd love 
to learn what he has to teach, but I don't seem to have the proper
background.  I don't want to beat my head against the wall trying to
compete with foreigners who do have the proper background.  There is
a serious fairness issue in my opinion.

Is there tutorial style help of high enough quality online to help a
person complete the algorithms and compilers courses(CS321 CS322 CS350)?

I'm close enough to the end of earning a degree in CS that getting help
to get through still makes sense.  Trouble is, I need to look outside of
PSU because of excessive anti cheating policies.  The University should
be self sustaining, it should be geared toward being able to educate
local residents instead of foreigners from other places.  Obviously,
PSU's ability or lack thereof to educate local residents isn't something
I have the power to improve or even influence right now.  I have a free
ride practically to attend PSU or else I'd be gone already.

Subject: [PLUG] help with iptables
Message-ID: <e4fa0a2da47b.4d8d674b@pcc.edu>

Hi,Anybody want some free lunchs for a bit of iptables advice? I'm rewriting student exercises for a Linux Networking class at PCC and want to add an iptables task in each lab.? I know enough about packet filtering to introduce the topic but not enough to write iptables rules an experienced practitioner might develop. Using VirtualBox, each student creates a network on their PC or MAC. Fedora guests act as servers, clients and an Internet gateway. In the lab assignments, a student installs services, watches the traffic, reconfigures, troubleshoot, etc. I need help writing rules that change from one lab to the next.If there's a better place to post, please adviseThanks,Mikemneal at pcc dot edu

I tried to understand the tomato pages, but it was even more confusing
than the Linksys configuration pages.

Understood. But it doesn't work. 

First I connected a cable from my 16-port switch to one of the numbered
ports on the Linksys. I was unable to connect to the Linksys via
192.168.1.1 or -0.1. I also tried moving the cable from the 16-port
switch to the D-Link router, but I got the same results. 

Then it dawned on me that it is transmitting, so I should be able to
connect to it from the laptop. I did another factory reset (so I would
know for sure that the address is 192.168.1.1), removed all cables, and
the laptop was able to connect to it. 

Then I set its address to 192.168.0.99, because the rest of the network
is -0-. I connected a cable from one of the numbered ports to the
D-Link router.

And finally I went into the Administration tab and set a password. 

It all appears to be fine, except that the phone cannot get an IP
address. It sees it, but the Linksys is refusing the connection. I
assume this is because the phone expects to connect to a DHCP server,
and the Linksys is no longer doing that. 

>As far as wireless security, MAC address based lockdowns are useless.

I set a password in the Administration tab. Is that where I set the WPA
password?

Personally, I just assume that anyone that I didn't give my address to, and
sends me a message is a scammer.

Unless she found your email address somewhere that had your information, she
was just sending to random addresses hoping someone would bite.  I would
personally assume the worst and stop all communications with her.  Too many
scammers out there and even if the photos are of her, she is probably
talking with a bunch of guys who are willing to give her money.

Good luck with whatever you decide to do.

The D-Link is acting as the DHCP server for your network. If the Linksys is
in switch mode, the D-Link's DHCP server will work for your phone. The
problem is something else.

That's the password for the management interface for the Linksys. In the
management pages, there should be a Wireless tab, and a Wireless Security
sub-tab. WEP bad, WPA good.

On the Setup page there is a dropdown at the very top, set to Automatic
Configuration - DHCP by default. (DHCP Server down below is set to
Disabled.) The other options in the dropdown are Static IP, PPoE, PPTP
and HeartBeat. 

On the Wireless tab there is a dropdown for Wireless Mode, where the
default is AP, and the other options are Client and Adhoc. It is set to
AP. Below is a dropdown for Wireless Network Mode, set to Mixed. The
other options are disabled, B only, G only, and Afterburner. Then there
is Wireless Network Name (SSID), where I entered JJJ. The next dropdown
is for frequencies, and I left it at the default 6-2.437 GHz. Wireless
SSID Broadcast is set to Enable.

There is a Security tab, but it applies only to the firewall, which is
enabled.

There is an Access Restrictions tab, which appears to be for allowing
only PCs with certain addresses, and also for restricting the time of
day when access is permitted.

The next tab is Administration which starts at the top with the router
password. Then it has:

Remote management (disabled)
Management port (grayed out)
Use https (unchecked)
AP watchdog (disabled)
Interval 15 seconds
Bandwidth management (disabled)
Boot wait (on)
Cron (enabled)
Dhcpd (disabled)
Static allocations (box is empty)
DNS masq (enabled)
Local DNS (disabled)
Loopback (enabled
802.1x (enabled)
NTP Client (enabled)
Server IP (box is empty)
PPTP server (disabled)
Resetbuttond (enabled)
Routing (enabled)
SSHD (disabled)
Syslogd (disabled)
Telnet (disabled)
Tftpd (enabled)
UPnP (disabled)

The final tab is Status, which reports the following:

MAC address: 00:0F:66:09:8C:BF
Router name (JJJ - I set it to this on the Setup tab)
Host name (blank)
Domain name (blank)
Login type (set to Automatic Configuration - DHCP)
IP Address (0.0.0.0)
Subnet mask (0.0.0.0)
Default gateway (0.0.0.0)
DNS 1, DNS 2 and DNS 3, all blank
At the bottom are two buttons: DNS Release and DHCP Renew.

Each of the above pages has a "more" button in the corner. If you click
on it you get a "help" page, that says really helpful things like
"Remote management: use this option to enable or disable remote
management." 

I hope somewhere in the above there is something that will make it
clear what is wrong. 

Or maybe this is the wrong kind of hardware for what I want to
accomplish. And you were right at the beginning - I don't intend to get
rid of the D-Link router, as it is an expensive gigabit router.

Yes, I'll definitely cut off communication if money is requested.  I'm
wondering if there is a danger though even if money isn't requested? I
might have scared the person off, so at this point the issue could be
moot.

I'm actually wondering if this is part of a harmless prank as my father
got a weird phone call where they said press 1 for voice mail and then
we got you.

I certainly am wondering if she is mass emailing people, but there is
nothing I have seen that would indicate that.  Even if she is, while
it is strange to contact strangers and try to form friendships with them
this doesn't seem overly problematic.  I question her approach, but not
what she claims to be after (if the email should be trusted at all).

Should I contact yahoo to inquire what this is about?  If he/she/it is
forging an address, yahoo should definitely go after the forger.  Does
Yahoo chase down email abusers?

I'm wondering if the pictures of the woman should be compared with
missing person reports, etcetera?  I'm not an investigator myself,
but perhaps saving whatever additional email I get someone else 
should investigate.

My problem, if any, is going to be watching the excitement that can be
stirred up and avoiding stupid mistakes when excited.  Yes, being
careful enough is going to be the challenge.  I should probably cut this
off soon, but there may be an opportunity for someone else to track down
what's really going on here.  I haven't kept every message I have
gotten, but I kept the last one.

I am keenly aware that this woman thinks she can excite me and possibly
get me to say something I shouldn't.  I am also concerned, this whole
thing strikes me as unusual.  Is a trend developing of Russian women
trying to contact foreign men?  If so, why?

Subject: [PLUG] RHEL/CENTOS/SL 5x, Firefox 4 and libstdc++
Message-ID: <20110326085223.GA9968@gate.kl-ic.com>

The firefox developers, in their reciprocally infinite wisdom,
are pushing Firefox 4, which requires libstdc++.so.6 with
GLIBCXX_3.4.9 .  The available libstdc++.i386 0:4.1.2-50.el5
RPM for RHEL 5x, CENTOS 5x, and SL 5x contains only GLIBCXX_3.4.8 .
You can read more about it here:
   http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=2075033

The hack mentioned (installing a newer version of libstdc++ in
the firefox4 directory) doesn't seem very upgradable.  It is
also not complete - in the binary directory (I've put mine at
/opt/firefox) you not only need to add the libstdc++.so.6.0.10,
you also must softlink it to libstdc++.so.6 so firefox can see
it.  Firefox 4 also can't find my firefox 3.6x passwords,
customizations, etc.  Back to 3.6.16 for now, until I figure 
out how to port those.

3.6.15 currently launches a security nag box to upgrade to 3.6.16,
but that gets redirected to 4.0 at the firefox website.

3.6.16 is hidden here:
   /pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/3.6.16/linux-i686/en-US/

Given the way they've structured things, there may not be a
3.6.17 and subsequent security upgrades.  I realize that some
people want the latest and greatest thing.  However, they are
not entitled to make that decision for others.  Perhaps
everything they own that is older than 3 years should be
confiscated, giving them a chance to test their philosophy
more generally.

Grump, growl.

Usually, the scenario is something where they are in trouble, or they want to come where you are, or something. 

They seem nice enough. So the conversation continues. 

Eventually, they gather enough information (search the web for social engineering) where they can tailor their conversations to seem like just the kind of people you like. 

Then they ask seemingly innocuous questions, spaced far enough apart that you don't realize what you are giving them. 

Further down the line, they have enough information, gathered from you, and from what they can find on the net, that they can open accounts in your name, or something else that you aren't expecting. 

And, as the story goes, they disappear "like a fart in the wind".

Oh, and this person you are talking to is smart enough to hide their yahoo profile. I just checked: http://profiles.yahoo.com/fili_olga

Looks like you aren't using TLS, that would be a great way to improve
your mail security.

Oh, and it also looks like you received some spam.  I'd delete it.

That was uncalled for, and I apologize to the firefox developers. 
They are doing good things in a global software ecosystem which
places little value on standards compliance, complexity management,
backwards compatability, or rigor.  They are competing with M$
eructations that are fast because they skip the code checks. 

In such a dangerous environment, survival can depend on
abandoning the old and the weak, and not looking back.

Perhaps I need another piece of code which automatically holds
any email sent after midnight until I've confirmed it 8 hours
later.  That would help with sleep-deprived oropedal insertion,
and might be helpful for security, too.

I am vaguely familiar with the regression testing that goes on
with Perl CPAN modules.  The Perl community is very test-oriented,
which is one reason they are a pleasure to hang out with.  With
most software, it seems that the tools are not available to
automate testing and perform detailed all-versions all-interfaces
testing on candidate software.  Most code developers release
the beta, wait for complaints, and, if no complaints are
career-threatening or accompanied with patches, ship.  

Part of the non-testing is versus old libraries.  At some point,
programmers say "I must use features that are only in libfoo
version 7 or higher", abandoning everyone whose systems use
libfoo versions 1 through 6.  Well, at least they are NOTICING
that they are depending on version 7 features.  Some coders
don't even bother with that.

In such an environment, why the heck do we design the loader
to require the use the same version of libfoo for every
application on the system?  Why not keep a disk copy of every
version of libfoo ever needed by any code ever run on the
system?  /usr/lib takes up about 2GB on my system - with
hard drives costing $80 for 2TB, and quintuple redundancy 
including backups), that 2GB costs me 40 cents.   With a
more granular way to tie applications to particular versions
of a library, The system could keep every version of libfoo
that is needed by any piece of code on the system, no matter
how ancient it is.  And that might cost only a couple of
bucks for 10GB of extra library.  

Yes, we still must test interdependencies between different
and independent packages, how they trade evolving data
structures, and how the different libraries interact with
the kernel and the compilers.  But most of these things
are tied relatively loosely - the interactions between
OpenOffice.org and Firefox are far fewer than the
interactions internal to each package, to associated
libraries, and to legacy content.  And these interactions
must be tested for security reasons anyway.

New distros clean up the mess, making sure all the apps
on the DVD use the latest libraries.  They do not need to
include all the legacy ones.  But if you have a good
reason to subsequently add an old app depending on old
libraries, the system should support that.

So.  At this late stage of the architecture of Linux, is it
possible to revamp ld() and the naming system for libraries?
Imagine that every application can choose the library
versions it wants to run, and every application installer
can dynamically assign paths to those libraries.  Perhaps
the loader can keep updatable "loader maps" for each
application somewhere, which help it decide which versions
of a library are usable.  With a non-permissive map, the
loader can use a 2003 version of a library forever, until
the app is updated.  Individual apps can be updated to
the latest libraries without triggering dependency hell. 

The /usr/lib disk footprint grows with time, but not nearly
as fast as the disks are growing.  The RAM footprint only
grows with the libraries actually in use at a given instant. 
So there may be 10 versions of a library, but typically
only one or two will be running at once.  A really
aggressive loader might compensate for the extra RAM usage
by loading only the portions of extra libraries that
differ, and stitching them together.  But the amount of 
RAM occupied by multiple versions of libraries will be
small, compared to the amount used by data structures,
or not returned to the system by sloppy garbage collection. 
Perhaps we can upgrade to cleaner versions of apps more
frequently if we are not bound by dependencies.

Why not?

If I understand their webpage, NixOs retains previous libraries,
enforcing compatability through compilation, but the previous
libraries are not simultaneously usable.  It seems more like
GenToo, which rebuilds everything from source (AFAIKS).  

NixOs appears to enforce One Giant Compatability.  You must have
the source for every component, and those components must all be
compatably written.  Besides make files and dependency lists,
there must also be an accurate Nix language description of those
dependencies.  NixOs looks like a great way to build small,
secure, and robust systems, and to test new configurations and
roll back to old ones.  But for big shambling collections of
thousands of applications from thousands of sources, such as
the typical desktop system, that seems impractical. 

In my case, even harder.  I write about 100 programs a year,
little one-offs that do some bit of numerical calculation for
something I am designing (my computer - computes!  Fancy that!!).
I would either do those outside of Nix (and risk them failing
if I tried using the binaries later), or I spend a lot of extra
effort describing their dependencies.

Real systems connect to other systems, and the dependencies 
spill across machine boundaries.  Sometimes you need to run
program version A to connect to machine A, and program version B
to connect to B.  That happens with Perl. Our friends at Redhat
have their own /usr/bin/perl, which is an old and strangely
patched version that is incompatible with most new stuff Out
There, but essential for their system tools to work.  So, we
also end up building /usr/local/bin/perl, keeping that upgraded,
and using that for everything besides system supplied stuff. 
It would be nice to have a less kludgy way to do such things,
and less work than rewriting everything for rigid compatability.

NixOs does not appear to have any mechanism for supporting
multiple versions of libraries simultaneously, and in fact
would make the "two-Perl" solution more difficult.  While it
would be nice to get everyone to write code that would play
together nicely, the history of a half century of software
production suggests this is unlikely. 

Is there something I don't understand here?  I don't run
GenToo, so perhaps recompiling and upgrading from source, and
determining the dependencies of applications, is not very hard.  

We build diverse systems.  Rather than wait for some miraculous
convergence on universally compatible code, perhaps it is time
to design for that diversity.

The NixOS package manager, Nix (which is separable from the OS), does
claim to support this.  Albiet, you *do* need to package the
application for Nix.  Such is often the case when you want more
capabilities, and if I can jump ahead a bit: determining and managing
the dependencies for a given application is devilishly hard (even if
you know all the valid version ranges, and all the version number
changes actually correspond to some sensible semantics, the general
case is NP-Complete.   If the semantics of the applications aren't
accurately represented by the version numbers it become uncomputable.)

>From the Nix page:

"Multiple versions

You can have multiple versions or variants of a package installed at
the same time. This is especially important when different
applications have dependencies on different versions of the same
package ? it prevents the 'DLL hell'. Because of the hashing scheme,
different versions of a package end up in different paths in the Nix
store, so they don?t interfere with each other."

I am also quite concerned about that -- and why I'm not
(intentionally) preaching in favor of NixOS.  There is a very good
chance it has insufficient package support.  I'm hoping to try an
install in a few weeks to see how the process goes.  If it's
relatively easy to create nix packages, then I'll likely use it, but
I'm somewhat uniquely motivated.  (Much of my recent work has been on
build systems, setting up continuous integration, and sandboxing --
three things that Nix should help with enormously.)

We're feeling a lot of the same pain, I think.  I can suggest a
solution for Haskell (cabal-dev), but I suspect that won't help you.
Building static binaries is the best solution I'm aware of at the
moment, and clearly not an option at all for many, many things.

There are things in the works that should help with this sort of thing
(locally, by Pluggers even! :)

Subject: [PLUG] libgd, php website hack, etc.
Message-ID: <20110327023936.GB13593@gate.kl-ic.com>

I have used libgd for lots of graphics;  writing text on images
made by other programs, for example.   Big investment.  The 
library works when dynamically linked, but I get a raft of errors
when I try to statically link it.  Still investigating that.  

In 2007, the original author Thomas Boutell passed version 2.0.33
on to the PHP folks, to be maintained at www.libgd.org .  About a
year of activity, then nothing, development stopped at 2.0.36RC.
with a release candidate that never released.  Sounds like my
code :-(  

Unfortunately, a lot of other packages, like gnuplot, pstoedit,
and inkscape depend on libgd.  If libgd dies of dependency
failure, so do they.

And now, www.libgd.org is down.  I haven't looked at it for a
few months.  I'm guessing the reason relates to this headline
from www.php.net:

I assume the PHP wiki software was written in PHP, the public
bathhouse orgy of programming languages.  But then so is
mediawiki.  Yikes!  I suppose I ought to ask a question about
now.  Here goes:

   libgd is not getting developed.  Its dependencies may be
   depreciating.  What function libraries are people using
   to synthesize 2-D images these days?  ImageMagick?

It made me laugh too, but since PHP is mostly written in C... what
does that make C?

The water of both bath houses and hospitals?

As far as GD being part of PHP now, if you want to help maintain it,
it's certainly possible to send in patches, but I tend towards
ImageMagick (and I have/had trunk commit rights to PHP).

WRT to "wiki.php.net" being down, as I understand it, it's much more
mundane (tech-wise) than it's being played up as. A brute force attack
(many months ago) got access to an account on the the PHP SVN trunk.
That exploited account was never used for more than minor testing in
the code, *however*, after the account password was changed, the
correlating account uname/pass wasn't changed across *all* PHP
properties... which meant that it was later used to pull all wiki
uname/pass combinations from the wiki, and gain access to the machine
running the wiki.

Which means that they're (the accounts) all exploitable via rainbow
tables attacks, if users used the same uname/pass across accounts.

In short: If somebody got your email password, and you were an admin
on *other* boxes, and you used the same password for all of the
accounts and services, things could get messy. Fast.

In a related note, I went to rubyonales in Bend last week, where one
of the speakers pointed at a total meltdown they were dealing with,
for very similar reasons.... they had a fail over system for hosted
sites, where any VM hosting sites that failed (for whatever reason)
failed back to a core, central, machine... Where apache ran as root.
So, the user web code ran as root. So.... their fail over system gave
their hosted users root.... On a box which shared root credentials
with all of their other boxes....

Yeah. You see where this is headed. A single failed site meant root
access to all sites, all machines.

After asking about the details on this "one too many times" to a tech
(nice guy, BTW, outside of this, best as I can tell) he got in my
face. Poor guy. Looks like a good company, but forcing a password
reset on hundreds, or thousands, of users must *really* suck.

...but it does sound like a good solution for the programs keith himself

You could Get a little fancier and make sure you copy all shared libs (all

The default factory settings should work fine for unprotected WiFi 
access.  Is the D-Link router handing out DHCP?  I'm also assuming the 
D-link is acting as your NAT firewall.  Where did the WRT54GL get its IP 
address?  First thing to check is the default route that the WRT54GL is 
using (should be 192.168.0.1), you won't get anywhere unless that is 
correct.  Once you get traffic outbound from the WiFi connections, then 
you can start locking it down.  I have a WRT54G (I think the L just 
means Linux compatible).  The Wireless security settings I have are:
WPA Personal
TKIP
Shared key
You should also enable MAC filter
On the Administration tab, disable remote management.

Thanks. I am already past these suggestions and have arrived at the
point of giving up.

The D-Link is a gigabit router that serves me well. Its IP address is
192.168.0.1, although the Linksys appears to see it as 192.168.0.0.

Since I want to use the Linksys only as an access point I have turned
off DHCP. (It's a WRT54G, not -GL as I originally thought.) In theory I
should be able to connect a cable from a port on my 16-port switch or
the switch plugs on the back of the D-Link router, with the other end
in one of the switch ports on the Linksys. One site I found said that
it might require a crossover cable and, indeed, that does work better. 

Setting it up with the crossover cable between the ethernet switch and
the switch outlets on the Linksys makes it possible for my laptop to
connect to it for administration purposes, and without using the
laptop's wireless. In other words, I can connect to it via ethernet and
do administrative stuff with its settings.

The default IP address of the Linksys is 192.168.1.1, but the rest of
the network is working with the D-Link, so I set the IP address of the
Linksys to 192.168.0.103. I set it to 103 because the D-Link's range is
100-200 and my laptop is already 102. For some reason that I cannot
recall, the desktop is set to 165. 

The problem is that when I connect the phone to it I cannot get an IP
address. Since DHCP is turned off on the Linksys it should just pass the
phone's request to the D-Link, but that does not happen. 

However, if I turn DHCP on in the Linksys, then the phone connects to
it without a problem. But the phone can't go anywhere on the internet.
That must be because the phone is getting its IP address from the
Linksys, not from the D-Link.

The D-Link is a DGL-4100. I looked through its settings and can't
figure out any reason why it cannot give IP addresses through the
Linksys. It certainly hands out IP addresses to my laptop and desktop
computers without a problem. 

On the Linksys Setup tab there is a subtab labeled Advanced Routing.
This tab offers a button "Show Routing Table." Clicking on it pops up a
window showing Destination LAN IP as 192.168.0.0 with subnet mask of
255.255.255.0 and gateway of 0.0.0.0 for LAN and wireless. I copied
these addresses into the appropriate places on the Advanced Routing
tab, but the phone still does not get an IP address from the D-Link.

I have spent hours getting this far. It's undoubtedly just one little
thing that is set incorrectly. But since Google and I can't find it, I
have given up. I'm just going to get a plain access point instead.

The network number (192.168.0.0) is not the same as a host's IP number.
Also, this doesn't matter in a switched LAN situation.

This has sparked a memory: there is a setting labeled something resembling
"AP Isolation" that protects devices on the LAN from each other. It's
designed to be used in unsecured wireless situations, where you only want
guests to be able to reach the Internet, and not any of your local devices.
If you find this and turn it off, things should work better. On my Linksys
device, it's under Wireless -> Advanced Wireless Settings.

If the D-Link's range is 100-200, you want to set static devices like this
Linksys deal to something outside the range. Otherwise, the D-Link has no
way of knowing that some device already has the IP 192.168.0.103, and will
hand that IP to the next device that DHCP-requests one.

Mark Jones has been teaching computer science in Oregon (and to 
"actual Oregonians") for quite a long time, first at OGI and then PSU. 
I've never been his student, but I've worked with him, and have found 
easy to understand, willing to back up and explain, and extremely 
approachable.

I've certainly never found his British backgound to get in the way of 
his communication.

I do suspect he falls squarely on the science side of the "computer 
engineering vs. computer science" debate, so he's going to demand you 
understand the theoretical and mathmatical underpinnings of the field. 
I further suspect that many would consider his approach quite 
appropriate for a university-level education.

Declaring him to be a roadblock to your education isn't fair to him, 
and probably doesn't serve your interests very well either.

Are you saying that Oregonians can't compete in the world market? That seems to be what you are implying.

Ah. There's the nail. You need more instruction.

You want Mark to dumb it down for you.

I don't think it's a fairness issue so much as an 'I don't understand this and it's hard' issue.

I don't have such a setting, at least not on that tab.

The number of possible permutations in the settings, even eliminating
the ones that are obviously irrelevant, is staggering. I could spend

In all fairness, there is a wealth of information both online and at the
Central Library that would help you understand the material. Both of these
resources have been invaluable in my own experiences in Computer Science.

This is certainly your decision, but I don't believe that any of the reasons
you have given thus far are valid. If you don't understand the material then
the responsibility lies on you to figure it out. The passion for Computer
Science should be reason enough to pursue solutions to concepts we don't
understand, but then again, this may just be my personal view.

Like I said, both the Library system and the web will guide you along in the
right direction. I certainly don't speak for the entire PLUG community, but
should you have any real, specific questions to ask, I don't think there
would be any problem in puzzling them out with you.

This alone should be reason enough to educate yourself on your own time.
Ultimately no one in the corporate world is going to sympathize with you
because foreigners "have the proper background", while you do not. There is
no clandestine agreement between Americans, nor is there one between
Americans and foreigners. As it has always been in this country, hard work
and going above and beyond are well rewarded, and this is precisely why
foreigners are applying for American jobs.

Ultimately, I find this question to be outside the realm of this mailing
list, and advise you to post this instead to PLUG Off-Topic. Should you
return to this list with Linux/Unix related questions, I will be more than
willing to troubleshoot them alongside you. Until then, I wish you the best
of luck.

I haven't read the entire (verbose) thread on this topic, but one
thing I'd like to point out if someone else hasn't:

Using multiple versions of the same library across multiple
applications costs you more than disk space.  It also costs you
additional memory (RAM) and therefore program exec start time, due to
greater I/O.

For instance, if we have ProgramA and ProgramB, where ProgramA is
linked against LibFoo 1.0 and ProgramB is linked against LibFoo 1.1,
then when both programs are running, each needs a copy of it's
respective version in memory.  If both were linked against the same
version of the library, then each would share that memory segment via
the operating system's MMU.  That is, ProgramA's virtual address space
has a segment mapped to the physical location of LibFoo, and ProgramB
would also have this mapping.  This saves memory and library loading
time.  

This is one reason why the lack of a coherent package management
system in Windows can lead to a big drop in efficiency (in addition to
"DLL Hell" where packages fight over .dll files in system paths).

Now I know some will say that one library here and there isn't a big
deal to load into memory, but it really can add up over time.  Clearly
though, many libraries do break backward compatibility over time and
it is unavoidable to have several versions of them lying around.  The
middle-of-the-road solution that most distros take is to have 
[libfoo1 version 1.0] and [libfoo2 version 2.0] installed at the same
time with appropriate dependencies created in the package management
system to track what is linked to what.  Over time, legacy apps are
updated and linked to libfoo2 and libfoo1 goes away.  I think this is
just the nature of distributed software development and the rapid
speed that open source software is advancing.  Some programmers are
better at it than others...

John,


Set you wireless on it's own subnet in front of your other router.  The 
subnet should be different from your current subnet.  If your current 
subnet is 192.168.0.0, the make the LAN subnet 192.168.1.0/24.

Have it receive the signal from your DSL/CABLE modem.

Assign an IP to your router/firewall.

Allow the wireless router to run dhcp for the subnet in a range of 100+

Leave your current router setup as usual but set it's WAN IP as the IP 
you assigned it in your wireless.

This gives you a firewalled wired network and still gives you 
flexibility to have ad hoc wireless connections.  Of course, you could 
have a MAC access list and WEP encryption.

Or am I missing something here?

The D-Link ethernet router is gigabit rated, far better quality than the
Linksys wireless router. Hence, it seems logical to me that the D-Link
should be the first in line after the cable modem. The D-Link goes to a
16-port switch, also gigabit rated, as is all the house wiring. 

I just tried it once more. First, I factory reset the Linksys, which
gave it 192.168.1.1. I cannot connect to that over ethernet, but my
laptop can connect to it wirelessly. I did so, then changed its IP
address to 192.168.0.3. Finally, I disconnected the laptop from the
wireless leaving it connected only by ethernet. Then I accessed
192.168.0.3 from the browser. It popped up a box asking for username
and password, and after supplying the defaults, it opened up in the
browser.

So now we know for a fact that the D-Link can send and receive data via
ethernet to the Linksys. 

However, if I disable the DHCP server on the Linksys the phone can't get
an IP address. If I enable DHCP on the Linksys then the phone gets an IP
address and can connect, but the IP address is assigned by the Linksys
and the phone still can't go out on the internet.

The D-Link is not passing an IP address through to the phone. 

In fact, the D-Link won't pass an IP address to the laptop either. If I
disable the ethernet connection on the laptop, and enable just the
wireless connection to the Linksys on the laptop, the laptop can't get
out on the internet either.

I think that all I need to do is get the D-Link to give IP addresses to
devices that are connected to the Linksys, but I haven't been able to
figure out how to do that. 

I also note that at the very top of the main setup page there is a
dropdown box with the following options:

	Automatic Configuration DHCP
	Static IP
	PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet)
	PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)

Automatic Configuration DHCP is the default and I haven't tried any of
the other settings. Note that the place to turn on/off the DHCP server
is further down the page. This setting is apparently to comply with the
requirements of an ISP.

Correct. These options relate to the Linksys' WAN IP, the one assigned by
the upstream device (usually your ISP). since you're not using the WAN port
on your router, these options are unrelevant.

Have you checked for firmware updates? If there is no "AP Isolation" option,
it may be something that is enabled and they just hadn't put the option to
turn it off into the firmware that is currently installed on your device.

First off, this claim that there is a stocked library for computer
science is interesting because this isn't mentioned as far as I'm aware
to students at PSU.  Where is it?  

Second off, PSU is tax payer supported where the education of local
residents should not be dumbed down so to speak, but local resident
students should be served and served well.  A good educator is aware
of the background of his/her students and will either a teach to that
background or b suggest to the students in trouble how to best get the
needed background.  You can't say to a PSU student you are paying for
high quality education in one breath and then in the next contradict
yourself by saying, but you have to educate yourself.  It can't be both
ways.  If I have to educate myself, why go to college at all?  In my
opinion, there is a tax payer mandate that PSU is not meeting very 
well.

Third, every person needs material presented to them in a way they can
understand it.  This isn't about dumbing anything down, this is about
educating people.  If the presentation doesn't fit you and you don't
know how to compensate, you don't learn.  This is really very simple.
I am looking for appropriate assistance for CS321, CS322, and CS350.
I need someone from outside the PSU system because I am sick and tired
of the anti cheating policies getting in the way.

I am spending hundreds to thousands of dollars, I would be a fool to
purposefully and knowingly cheat.  I am at PSU to learn or I wouldn't be
there at all.  There is no reason to sink thousands of dollars into an
education if I simply cannot understand the material coming at me.  What
is a couple hundred more for a high quality tutor?  I need a non PSU
affiliated tutor or I wouldn't be reaching out on this list.

Fourth, I've asked about tutorials online, are there any that would be
appropriate for algorithms and compilers?

That is certainly an issue.  On the other hand:

free:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       3114664     794856    2319808          0      57404     404636
-/+ buffers/cache:     332816    2781848
Swap:      4032304          0    4032304

I've got the RAM (*).  What I don't have time for is dependency
hell.  Which at best costs me hours at inopportune times, and
at worst means deleting applications that I've invested data in.
All my apps should not be so tightly bound together.  That makes
my system too fragile.

In another thread, I talked about libgd, which underlies a lot of
applications, but has gone without development in almost four years. 
The stuff that it depends on - libz, libpthreads - changes, and I
vaguely recall libpthreads is being replaced with the new flavor
of the month.  At the other end, gnuplot and indirectly inkscape
depend on it, and I will abandon those, and the dozens of quick
hacks I wrote based directly on libgd, when they pry libgd out
of my cold, dead fingers.  

Certainly, everything that can be upgraded - net connected stuff,
for example - should be upgraded.  And I do want to minimize the
amount of library bytes I depend on.  But some things aren't
getting the TLC they need, and if there was 200 of me I couldn't
keep them all synchronized with the newer stuff else.

Sometimes you just need to keep the old stuff alive, because
"they don't make it like that anymore".  The T?dai-ji temple
in Nara, Japan, is the largest wooden structure in the world. 
It was completed in 751 AD.  Every stick in it has been
replaced multiple times.  And it is still neat to look at, and
still "compatable with the original API".  While a glass and
concrete hangar with a video wall Buddha might be more modern,
rich architectural ecosystems still need wooden temples. 

A rich Linux ecosystem needs the same.  While sparse, lean, and
optimized has its advantages, it leaves some users behind, and
makes everything in the system vulnerable to a few weak links.
If the old libraries and applications are still usable, keep
them around.  They might not have the same weaknesses as the
latest and greatest code.

I hope some Linux programs will still be around in 1260 years,
even if every line of the source has been replaced multiple
times.  Perhaps tuxracer will be preserved for its Buddha Nature.

Two points:
1. While we could all keep up with Moore's law, should we? Wouldn't it
be better if things got cheaper, without changing the minimum
hardware?
2. The *huge* Windows security hole was created by extensive backwards
compatibility. Make a system compatible with 6 (or 16) year old
libraries, get 6 (or 16) year old viruses on those libraries.

Things generally change for a reason.

Excellent suggestion. The Linksys web site did have a firmware upgrade
(from 2.0 to 4.3) and I just applied it. The setup screens are now very
different, lots of different options. And the help information is now
right on the same page instead of having to click on "more..." to get a
new page with the help.

After applying the firmware upgrade you have to reset to factory
defaults. I did so, then set the IP address to 192.168.0.3 (via
wireless, because 192.168.1.1 is not visible to my ethernet), then
turned off wireless connection and was able to get to it by ethernet.
Then I turned off DHCP server and went to Setup > Advanced routing,
clicked on the Show Routing Table button, and copied the Destination
Lan IP and Subnet mask into the fields.

Then I tried to connect the phone. Still could get an IP address from
the D-Link. Finally, I went back to the Linksys setup and turned DHCP
server back on, then was able to connect the phone. But the phone still
cannot go anywhere.

So the firmware upgrade is an improvement, but did not resolve the
problem. The Linksys is still not passing an IP address from the D-Link
to the phone.

Message-ID: <000f01cbed69$4d020c80$e7062580$@martinconsulting.com>

Fellow PLUGgers,

I'm using Asterisk, essentially as an intelligent voicemail system
(time-based outgoing messages, blacklists, text message alerts, etc.).  I
see that my TDM400 card is going to fail -- the electrolytic capacitors are
starting to bulge.  A replacement card from Digium is going for about $700,
which is more than I want to pay.  The motherboard on the host system also
looks like it's having trouble, so I have an opportunity to completely
change hardware.  My requirements are:

- two Telco lines, currently POTS, but they arrive via FIOS if that provides
any additional options
- roughly eight analog phone handsets that do not need to be handled
individually (they currently all share the same TDM400 port, which is fine)
- ability to customize the Asterisk configuration files as normal.
- fax support is a plus, but not required

Obviously I can replace the Digium card and motherboard.  What other choices
should I consider?

Keith,

Certainly dependency management can be difficult, but consider the
fact that every distribution has to support the libraries they
release.  Each time a vulnerability comes out in libfoo, they'd have
to back patch it in every version of the library.  If they try to
support some old version of libfoo that even the upstream developers
don't support anymore, then that can lead to huge headaches for the
distribution's maintainers.

Instead, users are free to install their own libraries and manage
their own legacy dependencies if they wish.  For instance, with
Debian-based systems (and likely others, which I can't speak to) it is
also relatively easy to build your own backports from the Debian
source packages and host your own apt server that lets you manage
those dependencies yourself in the way you want, overriding the builds
of specified packages in the mainline distribution.

<rant>
And finally on the topic of memory consumption, even though this is a
small piece of the issue, I regularly run up against memory limits on
my 2GB desktop.  Yes, I am planning on buying more RAM, but it seems 
that every application likes to assume they can use as much RAM as 
they want because it is so cheap now.  I run *lots* of apps at once 
and regularly have to fight with those apps that are memory hogs 
simply because the developers are too lazy to think through what 
really needs to be in memory.

Note that using more memory than I have available is bad enough, but
it also leads to computation bottlenecks in modern systems.  The speed
of memory continues to diverge from the speed of CPUs.  The more
useless junk you store in memory, the more you blow your CPU's cache
on pointless garbage and the more time you spend loading and
accessing stuff from RAM.  It still makes sense to design software
around not using too much memory, particularly in an age where
everything is going mobile.
</rant>

Now, with all that I've said in favor of the current model, I do feel
your pain when it comes to using particular groups of software
packages.  Many of the libraries supporting Linux GUIs are incredibly
fragmented with many ugly interdependencies.  I am not a GUI
developer, but I suspect many Gnome and KDE libraries implement
duplicate functionality throughout the code, even within their own
projects, because they don't organize the code well enough to provide
good code reuse.  

Consider the X11 clip board vs the Gnome/GTK/etc clipboards.  I don't
know what all standards and APIs exist for this, but I do know it is
an utter pain in the ass to copy and paste text between different
applications on my system.  My preferred terminal program, urxvt,
supports traditional X copy/paste (select the text to copy, middle
click to paste) which I really like.  Most other applications on my
system also support this style of copy/paste.  However, recently i've
noticed Java GUIs do not support this (anymore?).  I can't copy from
my terminal and paste into Java apps, and since uxrvt doesn't support
Windows-style 'CTRL-V' for paste (as it is a terminal that interprets
this other ways), I can't paste from Java to urxvt.  Apps like
Firefox support both methods of copy paste and OpenOffice.org seems to
change its policies on what kinds of copy/paste it supports with every
minor release (sometimes pasting web page text as simple text, other
times pasting it as formatted text, and this is different between
CTRL-C copies vs X11 copies).  It is just brain-numbing and foolish
that this stuff isn't better standardized.

Surely this clipboard complexity comes along with weird library
dependencies, according to what apps support what methods.  Overall
this is just a sign of bad design though, rather than a fault of the 
distribution's maintainers do keep supporting multiple releases of the
bad designs.

Regards,
tim

John, you've not ever stated what IP addresses and IP configs
your Linksys is handing out.
Reading through the threads I don't see any
full, in one post, listing of how the DLink and Linksys are addressed.? This
information is needed for us to really understand what you are
doing.

ATA devices.  Something like a Sipura SPA 3000 or two should do what you 
need.  I think there are even some multiple FXO/FXS devices out there. 
I haven't got to the point of needing one (using Polycom and soft 
phones) so can't offer any _actual_ usage advise.

I offer the Sipura SPA 3000 just because it was the first/best found 
with a search for "Asterisk ATA fxo" using Google.  There are others and 
some are probably better/cheaper/k00l3r.


YMMV,
Rod

Subject: [PLUG] Upgraded from Debian Lenny to Squeeze,
	and now my machine won't boot....
Message-ID: <AANLkTikm+5TMiJ+8FmePg0svt=Wv0SasQkQvkp79ZZT7@mail.gmail.com>

I have an older Dell Optiplex GX260 running Debian lenny. It has worked for
years as a desktop and a small web server. At one point one of the
integrated IDE disk controller channels died, so I installed a new disk
controller card, a Silicon Image 0680 ATA133 and it worked out of the box
with the two drives for the past 3 months. Last weekend I tried a
dist-upgrade to squeeze. The upgrade had no errors, so I rebooted the
machine, and now all I get is a grub menu.

When the machine boots, the Silicon Magic displays it's banner and
recognizes the two drives installed in the machine (same as before the
upgrade). I then get the message loading grub 1.5, and I then get dumped to
a grub menu. It seems the boot process does not access the Silicon Image
controller, although it did before I upgraded to squeeze. I tried accessing
the drive from the grub prompt, but the disk access light does not seem to
light up - only the cd light.

I tried booting from a Knoppix 4.6.6 CD, and it worked. I am able to browse
the internal hard drives with no problem and read files. So, at least
Knoppix can use the controller card and the hardware is not dead. I noticed
on the upgrade from lenny to squeeze I went from kernel 2.6.21 to 2.6.26.

Any suggestions on how to get the machine to boot again?

Thanks,

Mark

I happen to be prepared for this question; I just got my plugpbx.org system
going. But it took me several days to do so.   Including an OS upgrade
(because system time wasn't being update) which broke some stuff.

With the plugpbx, you could possibly do the d/a  and a/d conversion with 1
or more cheap linksys or other box(es).  Although you should experiment with
these boxes first, in my case the echo cancelling was unsatisfactory.  I did
use a digium clone a/d card which was much better, but I finally gave up on
a/d on the phone line.  (I could make you a deal on that card.. )

If circumstances permit you could replace the POTS lines with commodity voip
lines (I use vitelity.com ). Downsides include different and unlisted phone
numbers, more fiddling and in my experience less reliability.  Upside is
huge cost savings and supplier independence.

When the machine boots, can you tell what version of grub is running?
Sometime recently in Debian they switched from grub 1.x to grub 2.x
and it is possible that 2.x doesn't recognize your SI controller or
something.  If you think the bootloader did get upgraded, you could
try using a boot disk to drop back to grub 1.x.   Just the first
thought that comes to mind.

HTH,
tim

Not to rain on your upgrade parade but a google image search for
digium TDM400 shows a board with approx. four through-hole
electrolytic caps on it. Four caps that probably cost a buck, maybe
two, and a half hour of effort to replace.

A few more observations....

I tried using grub to attempt to boot. I set up the following based on (1)
what I saw using the knoppix disk that the internal drives were mounted on
/media/sda5 and /media/sdb1...../media/sda5 has the normal linux file system
and sdb1 has my backup folders, and (2) grub's tab completion.

grub> root (hd0,4)
grub> kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.21-1-686 root =/dev/sda5
grub> initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.26-1-686
grub> boot

I get as far as:
Kernel panic: not syncing: VFS unable to mount rootfs on unknown block(0,0)

If I back down to 2.6.21. or 2.6.18 I get this error:
Begin: mounting root file system...
Begin: running /scripts/local_top...done
Begin: waiting for root file system...

So, I guess my original hypothesis is wrong...the SI drive controller may be
working....except for a small annoying kernel panic or inability to load the
file system....

Does this help anyone figure out what I should do?

Thanks,

Mark

Forgot to add, the machine says it is using grub 1.5.

Ok, so it sounds like grub is finding your root partition fine, but
the kernel isn't.  I see above that you indicated you are specifying a
2.6.21 kernel and a 2.6.26 initrd image.  That is most likely not
going to work.  Have you tried setting those version numbers the same
on any of the alternative kernels you've tried?

Sorry, that was a typo in the email. When typing at grub I used completion
to make sure I had the same versions.

Ok, no problem.

Was "root =/dev/sda5" also an email-only typo?  That is, there is a
space between root and = which may create problems for you as well...

I am trying to use sshpass to log onto an Ubuntu server. While sshpass works
great when logging onto Gentoo hosts, it hangs forever when connecting to
Ubuntu hosts. I tried fiddling with sshd_config with no luck. Any ideas?

Thanks,

verbose output from client and server during a failed login would help
out a lot in any diagnosis i could provide.

Here is the output from the server with LogLevel DEBUG3. I am logging in
with an LDAP account. Logging in normally (ssh ckonstanski at host) works fine.
So any messages claiming that the password is invalid are bunk, unless
sshpass is munging the password. Trying to figure out how to get more
logging on the client end. Any help in this area would be appreciated.

I see what appears to be a failed password lookup. Hard to tell if I can't
determine what it thinks I sent as the password. Hard for me to believe that
sshpass is munging the password though, since I can use it to log onto a
non-Ubuntu server just fine.

I was fooled by authorized keys. sshpass actually is failing no matter what
distro the remote host is, provided I don't have a key installed.

ps on the client shows something interesting. The password looks to be
munged. My password is not zzzzzzz:

sshpass -p zzzzzzz ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
ckonstanski at vir.ps.isu.edu echo hi

So now the problem is to figure out:

- is this really the password sshpass is sending, or is it just obfuscating
it for security reasons?

- why the hell is it munging the password for chrissakes?

Carlos

Sorry for the confusion. I have tried various things over the past 24
hours, thus the settings were always changing. Here is the current
setup (hope the ASCII art is clear):

	  Cable Modem
		    |
	  D-Link Router -- Linksys WRT54G
		    |
	 16-port switch
		    |
	     Wall jacks
	       /         \
	      /           \
	Laptop*   Desktop

*Laptop lives in a mini-dock at home, hence connected to ethernet.

The D-Link router is set to 192.168.0.1, subnet mask 255.255.255.0,
DHCP server: Enabled, range -100 to -199. Route is 192.168.0.0.

Laptop is 192.168.0.102. Desktop is 192.168.0.165. I also have four
networked laser printers using other addresses in the 100 to 199
range, none currently turned on. The D-Link web based setup page sees
both the desktop and the laptop. It does not see the Linksys router.**

The Linksys router is connected from one of its switch jacks to one of
the switch jacks on the D-Link with a crossover cable. I can also
connect it to one of the jacks on the 16-port switch, which makes no
difference in the results.

The Linksys is set to 192.168.0.3, subnet mask 255.255.255.0, DHCP
server: Disabled. I have also tried setting it to 192.168.0.103, but it
made no difference. On its web setup page there is an Advanced Routing
tab with a button that says "Get Routing." Clicking on the button pops
up a window displaying the LAN route as 192.168.0.0, subnet mask
255.255.255.0. I take this to mean that it sees the D-Link. I copied
the addresses into the fields in the Advanced Routing tab. 

The laptop and desktop can access the Linksys web based setup page over
the ethernet. Proof of this is that the desktop has no wireless at all,
but still brings up the Linksys setup page in Firefox.

**The problem no doubt lies in the fact that the D-Link does not see the
Linksys, hence does not give it IP addresses to pass to the phone. Yet
it is physically connected and both computers can access the Linksys
setup pages over ethernet. I think it's the D-Link that's being a brat,
not the Linksys. But I don't know how to convince it to play nice with
the Linksys.

OK, try
this:
Plug the Linksys into the 16 port switch, leave it at
192.168.0.3
Enable it to be a DHCP server with these
settings:
DHCP range 192.168.0.65 - 192.168.0.99
Default GW
192.168.0.1
DNS servers - whatever they are for your
network.
There may be a setting to have the Linksys bridge all
interfaces, if you can find that enable it.? (I don't use stock firmware so I
don't know the specifics.? But that's the concept.)
Another question -
does the DLink function as a firewall for you?? If it does can you access the
logs?

Have you looked at the LPI or RHEL study guidelines?

Practically speaking, "experienced practitioners" don't get fancy.  If you
can cover basic port-blocking/opening, forward-dynamic and reverse-static
NAT, you'll have well-educated students.  If they get a little experience
with the Red Hat and UFW config files, all the better.
Combine with IP Route, and you're great.

You might find interesting things in the LARTC or the NAT HOWTO.

I have made some progress.... When I use these parameters at the grub
prompt, the machine boots. X is dead, and so is mysql...not sure why, yet.
However, I cannot change menu.lst to reboot....I always get tossed out to
the grub menu.

grub> root(hd0,msdos5)      //msdos5 comes from tab completion and is the
only option
grub> linux /boot/linux-2.6.21.1-686 root=/dev/hda5
grub> initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.21.1-686
grub>boot

Any thoughts or suggestions?

Thanks,

Mark

Glad to hear you got it booting.  Now that you're this far, can you
send us your /etc/fstab and /boot/grub/menu.lst files?  Also, if you
suspect that some partitions aren't mounting properly (possibly
causing X/mysql/etc to fail) please include the output of the 'mount'
command so we can see what succesfully mounted.

thanks,
tim

After doing the above I can no longer access the Linksys, not even from
the laptop connected to it via wireless. I'm going to have to do a
factory reset and start over.

This was an excellent suggestion. For some reason it did not occur to
me to check the logs on either router. Interestingly, the D-Link logs
show that it denied access to the LAN ten times in a row to the Linksys
(that is, a device with the Linksys MAC address). Unfortunately, the
message was dated April 12, 2004 at 16:39.49. Apparently the clock in
the D-Link is a bit lagged. :)  And a cursory look through the settings
did not reveal a button to reset it. I'll poke at that later. For now,
though, at least we know for a fact that the D-Link is refusing the
connection. Once I get the clock fixed I'll be able to see better
exactly when the connection denials occur to match them up with
attempts by the phone to get an IP address and to go out on the net.

And yes, the D-Link does function as a firewall. The log is mostly
denied UDP packets from all over.

Computer science is as relevant to Linux as it is to any other operating
system one may want to discuss.  If every computer scientist on the face
of the earth dropped dead tomorrow, that would be a massive setback for
Linux.  A student mailing list is not appropriate because I need
assistance from outside the PSU system.  If I'm going to be able to code
device drivers for Linux in the future I'm going to need to know
something about compilers and a good deal about algorithms.  This is not
a plug-talk appropriate discussion because plug-talk is for politically
biased garbage.

You cannot specify a default gateway in the Linksys (or any other major
brand's) router's stock firmware. This may be possible with an aftermarket
firmware.

This is pretty much what the "AP Isolation" setting controls. "isolation" in
this case refers to isolating LAN clients from each other.

The Linksys web setup pages allowed me to do so, but afterwards I was
unable to connect to it, either via ethernet or wireless. Had to do a
factory reset and start over.

Hey all,

Has anyone played with kismet? I just installed kismet, configured and

the web for answers on the kismet output more annoying, though I can 
plug into the hotels network cable.

Anyone know why this happens? Is there a way to avoid it with something

OK, set the clock on the D-Link to an ntp server at dlink.com and
enabled daylight savings time. 

Then I factory reset the Linksys, connected via wireless, set the IP
address to 192.168.0.3, turned off DHCP server, and set the LAN address
to what the Linksys sees on the D-Link, i.e., 192.168.0.0 and
255.255.255.0. Saved the settings, turned off wireless on the laptop,
reconnected to the Linksys via ethernet to be sure it was still
connecting with copper.

Then I attempted to connect with the phone. It failed to get an IP
address. But after refreshing the logs in the D-Link I find:

	[INFO] Mon Mar 28 20:23:56 2011 Access denied to LAN system
	with MAC address 002376D41C61

That is the MAC address of the phone.

So it appears my hunch may be correct - it's the D-Link that is being
obstreperous. Any D-Link experts here?

The default gateway is irrelevant for devices on the same subnet.
Are you sure you didn't typo the Linksys IP addr?
At times like this it is handy to use nmap to ping sweep your network.

so that is working...

The menu.lst is strange....but I tried changing root (hd1,4) to root(hd0,4)
or root(hd0,msdos5) which actually gets the machine to boot from the grub
prompt, and it does not boot. And for some reason /initrd.img-2.6.26-1-686
is broken; unreadable, at least from the grub prompt. I can only boot from
2.6.21.

Thanks for you help!

You are not the plug community Russell and I never said that Mark Jones
can't teach.  Nobody is incapable of learning where not everyone can
learn about computer science in general and Linux specifically the same
way.  Mark Jones in my opinion teaches in a way that demands a different
background than the average person who grows up in Oregon is likely to
have.  If it is hard to learn from Mark Jones because K-12 education
stinks in Oregon, that's not Mark Jones fault.  Stop being a bully
Russell, what does it give you quite frankly?

I hate plug-talk, I hate reading that Obama needs a new pair of shoes
when I voted against him.  I also hate that people will get into
atheistic rants on there among other things.  That this community
maintains the plug-talk list at all is in my opinion a sad state of
affairs.

Now it is widely known that Mark Jones is a computer science teacher.  
I am writing about computer science if I talk about him, that is
understood, and that is indeed germane to this list.  Is plug for the
discussion of Linux/Unix specifically and in more general terms 
computer science, or not?

If tomorrow there are no new computer scientists and the ones that
currently exist die off sooner than later, Linux will be severely
impacted.  Helping someone get through computer science and become
competent, especially someone who wants to work on Linux systems, is in
the long term interest of this community.  Linux would not exist at all
if Linus hadn't received help from others over the Internet.  Imagine
Linux coming to fruition if it had been Linus's private project
developed without the benefit of the GNU tools and without the Internet.
There would be no Linux as we know it in that kind of an environment.
I'm sure Linus is intelligent and quite skilled, but look at OS projects
like Syllable, ReactOS, and especially Visopsys which need more help.
ReactOS, 12+ years old, is not stable.  Linux is what, 21 years old?
Hasn't Linux been usable since 1993?  The difference between Linux and
ReactOS or Linux and Visopsys is that Linux became usable quickly.
Point is, that wouldn't have happened if Linux had been Linus's pet
project or private hobby.  Linus had to learn a lot to cobble together
the first stable Linux kernel.

Kismet puts your wireless interface in monitor mode and starts hopping
channels.  Using your wireless radio to continue communicating in the
normal fashion under such circumstances is, er, challenging.

Try using a second radio, maybe?  For example, you could use a USB
radio to maintain your network connection and your built-in radio for
sniffing or vice versa.

I'm done trying to explain it to Michael. Maybe if he gets zero replies to his messages...

I concur, although it wouldn't be fair to Michael Robinson to ban him
from the list for posting complaints about his experience at PSU that we
can't advise him about or otherwise help him to resolve or accept.

However, I think he needs to get a grip and realize that he is solely
responsible for what he learns, how quickly he learns it, and how far he
can go with it. I don't think I'm far wrong to surmise that almost
everyone on this mailing list is self-taught in part if not all parts of
computer science, software programming in general, Linux and other
operating systems. Michael has to suck it up and either learn or not.

Certainly no one taught me IBM mainframe assembly language when I had to
learn it. I learned it by reading and doing it, a process of trial and
error, and I took what I learned and made a good living at it for about
20 years. But no one handed it to me, or tutored me. I learned, because
I worked at it. I focused on it, and was not unfocused, then.

All we can do, I think, is suggest that Michael, take your complaints
about PSU to PSU, not here. Got a Linux problem? Ask away. Thank you.

Even that's likely more than this topic deserves on this mailing list
but that's what I think.

Regards,
Robert

Up on the Linksys I have once again given. It will go into my Clinic
box and next month maybe we'll have time to play with it at Free Geek.
It might be good to leave it there for those occasions when the
wireless is down.

I have ordered a D-Link DWL-2100AP access point:

http://www.d-link.com/products/?pid=292

I got it used on Amazon for $30. Hopefully it will be simpler to
configure.

He's already spent the money. Just let him do it the way he wants to. It's
possible there is something wrong with his Linksys device. I'll get my hands
on it at the next clinic and then we'll know for sure.

Mike,

I haven't responded, because I don't have much experience using
iptables directly.  Once it gets beyond setting setting up a simple
chain of two or three iptable commands, I have always gone to some
fancy ready made script.

Using VirtualBox, each student creates a network on their PC or MAC. Fedora guests act as servers, clients and an Internet gateway. In the lab assignments, a student installs services, watches the traffic, reconfigures, troubleshoot, etc. I need help writing rules that change from one lab to the next.If there's a better place to post, please adviseThanks,Mikemneal at pcc dot edu

It is also possible there is a (perhaps deliberate) incompatibility
between the D-Link and the Linksys.

Thanks for the offer. As for generosity, I think that Russell has done
more for me than I for him, not that I'm the type to keep a ledger.
Besides, I ordered the D-Link access point yesterday and Amazon just
sent me an e-mail that the seller had already shipped it. And playing
with the Linksys at the next Clinic will be educational.

I'm sure a lot of people who read this list are out of work right now
who have vast Linux/Unix and other computer science experience.  Instead
of berating me for saying I'm experiencing difficulty with PSU, consider
that I'm willing to pay someone who is independent for professional help
with algorithms and compilers.  It wouldn't be a lot, but if you are
unemployed it would be better than nothing and much better than free.

Those who are saying force him off, a couple of points:

1:  The failure of people to enter the field of computer 
    science will directly impact this community, eventually.

2:  I never said that Mark Jones can't teach.

3:  Who can teach him/herself advanced mathematics without help?

4:  Just because you think the group is on your side, that doesn't mean 
    that there aren't 3 people out of every four who isn't.  Please,
    could the majority speak up?

5:  The plug-talk list is worse when it comes to bullying that this 
    list is.

For you elitists who say teach yourself because I did, that isn't
community spirit at all.  If Linus had met with that, he may have 
given up on producing a free UNIX like kernel a long time ago.

Ageed! Teachers don't exist to make computer scientists out of every
person who takes their course. In fact they can't make anything out of
anyone. What they can do is facilitate your learning and some of them
are a far bit more effective at it than others. We're living in the
information age. You don't have to rely on one teacher to show you the
hidden secrets as if you were learning some ancient martial arts
style.

To put it in words Michael can relate to, "seek and ye shall find". Be
a seeker of knowledge. Start now.

In more practical terms. What about talking to one's classmates and
see if they're having similar difficulties and/or start a study group.

Speaking of which, every issue raised in this email belongs on plug-talk.
We did discuss Michael's emails there, but sadly, Michael didn't participate.

I want to alert the PLUG community, particularly those that work or
live in the City of Portland and want fiber someday, to a series of
public meetings to discuss a Broadband Strategic Plan that the City is
working on.  I served on a working group to help with the process.  I
am not sure of the meeting schedule yet, but back in January the plan
was to have the hearings in April and a council vote on a finalized
Plan in June.

Your attendance and voice in these meetings is essential, because:

 a) the Plan threatens to set City policy for the next decade; and

 b) the Plan is currently very weak and needs lots of people who care
    to tell them how completely inadequate it is.

Here is my case in a nutshell:

 1) Communications users get screwed (on terms of service and/or
    price) when there is no competition;

 2) No one builds a second cable system because it's not economical;

 3) No one will build a second fiber-to-the-premises network once one
    is built, for the same reason;

 3.5) Wireless technologies are nice, but they don't scale very well;

 4) Open-Access (the ability for competitive service or content
    providers, e.g. other ISPs or video channels, to have access to
    customers at non-discriminatory rates) on the infrastructure is
    needed to have any real competition;

 5) Privately-owned infrastructure does not have Open-Access.
    Portland went to court to try to force Open-Access on cable and
    lost.  There is no Open-Access on FiOS either.  Neither the FCC or
    the US Congress is on users side.  Google's fiber project (going
    to Kansas, in case you missed it) is the lone exception on new
    infrastructure.

 6) So, in the Real World, you need publicly-owned infrastructure to
    get Open-Access.  The only alternatives are extremely unlikely: a)
    breakup of vertically-integrated communications companies; or b)
    federal intervention on the side of network users.  Frankly, I'd
    expect to get hit by a meteor first.

 6) So, if you want Competition (to keep prices low and terms fair),
    you need Open-Access.  To get Open-Access you need public
    ownership of infrastructure to ensure Open-Access.  So,
    Competition requires Public Ownership.

 7) Portland's Broadband Strategic Plan must recognize and address this
    problem aggressively (it does not even touch on residential
    service in its current draft form).

If you live in Portland, want fiber someday, and don't want to be
perpetually screwed, I urge you to write, attend these meetings, and
make your voice heard.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=dGANnv6gZk7Ra6uToFz-USupn1DPh6f7OOwK6@mail.gmail.com>

Hey.

So, my server has a fairly boring LSI JSOD SAS controller running the
set of SATA disks, and it has taken recently (and newly) to throwing a
whole pile of errors at me:

mptbase: ioc0: LogInfo(0x31080000): Originator={PL}, Code={SATA NCQ
Fail All Commands After Error}, SubCode(0x0000)
mptbase: ioc0: LogInfo(0x31181000): Originator={PL}, Code={IO
Cancelled Due to Recieve Error}, SubCode(0x1000)

I tend to get clusters of like commands, and timing varies a bunch; at
least some people report SMART commands triggering these errors, but I
can't track any down or anything.

Annoyingly, they don't seem to indicate a specific unit is
responsible, there is no useful documentation to decoding the meaning
of the message, and no utilities to indicate what on earth the root
cause is.  Worse, no other visible errors from the system, so
presumably whatever it is does not propagate up to the kernel enough
to trigger any higher level problems...

So, can anyone advise on how to track down the root cause of these
problems?  This is a production system, so I don't especially want to
take it offline or anything, and I can't see any specific externally
visible problems this is causing...

Agreed, my mentor pointed me in the direction of gentoo in late 2000, he
told me to do a stage 3 but compile my own kernel.
When stuck, he would refer me to the handbook. When I complained enough, he
would tell me to port forward Ssh(22) and scuttle my whole setup or other
mischief.

It took me 3 weeks to get a working kernel, only able to surf the net via
links/lynx during that time was an experience(live cd).

Perseverance, was what he was showing/teaching about success with linux.

Tl;dr show a man to fish/teach a man to fish.

Is a regular poll of this page the best way to stay aware?

Or is there some other, better, more _pushy_ method for keeping myself
aware?

A very good lesson. :)

What it should teach us all is that even when one is being instructed by a teacher, one is also teaching themselves. So, those who learn to teach themselves, go far. 

Just because I consider myself 'self taught' does not mean the community did not help. Quite the contrary. The community supported me and continues to support me in my continued education in the computer industry. Without that support, I would not be where I am today. 

My college education is actually in Automotive Technology. When I started asking people what good was that, the most common reply was, "You learned how to learn." Without that, learning can be quite frustrating.

That's as good a place to watch as any.  I have just ping'd Mary Beth
Henry (the person leading the effort) to inquire.  I am likely to let
you know here as soon as I've heard anything. :-)

You could also email them at the address below to let them know you are
interested in the issue, and that competition and capacity to your
homes is important to you and that you want to see a plan that serves
more than a few percent of the population.  Or, hell, you could just
cut and paste my 7.5 steps to Success if you agree and/or are lazy.
Or just say "I'll have what Personal Telco is having" if you are even
lazier.  Include "Broadband Strategic Plan" somewhere in the subject
line.

Russell,

The text message didn't wake me up.  I was actually just sitting down
after working all day.  I looked at matters and then decided to wait
until morning before calling Wil - and one must remember my mornings
come rather late now days.

Which LSI SAS controller are you using?
Have you updated to the latest firmware?

Yes you are right.  These messages are down at the Protocol layer.

The commands that are getting these errors that you are seeing are either being
retried in the firmware layer of the card or in the Linux driver layer.

Also if this is a 3Gb SAS system, there is many fixes in the LSI
drivers from the LSI web site.
Most of the fixes are related to handling SATA devices on the SAS bus.

Oog.  All I can suggest is:
* Use available utils (sdparm, smartctl etc.) to check for logged errors or
  wierdness.  See: http://hwraid.le-vert.net/wiki/LSIFusionMPT
* Take down the server and check SAS connections at hotswap bay and inside
  the case.

The http://hwraid.le-vert.net site is my go-to resource for HW RAID stuff.
It has various OSS and prorpietary tools nicely packaged for RPM and DEB.

Subject: [PLUG] Question on image stitching for movie making
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=3kBVFfW6N+45m5=zW3U2isiiGD3eL4m697GwV@mail.gmail.com>

I have a collection of waterfall dfft image files (png format) that
cover several months of data.  Each image file is complete for the
time duration, if you were to stitch them all together, they would
amount to a complete waterfall for the months time period.

I would like to use them to create a movie, the ffmpeg command seems
ideal, however it only takes complete png file(s) at a time.  This
makes for a jerky movie as it quickly jumps from image to image.
However I want to gradually pan from one png file to the next.  Allow
me to explain.

Imagine that we stitch two png files together into one longer one.
Then we gradually pan a camera taking the original width snapshot,
starting at the left edge and gradually panning to the right,
incrementing evenly.   This allows the movie to gradually pan from one
image to the next instead of sudden jerks of whole images.

What is a good way to do this?  It means creating an individual png
file for each camera increment, but obviously the original png files
have to be torn apart and stitched carefully into new ones.

What's a good program for doing this?  While I do have the original
data that made the png files, each data file is over 600 megs in size
so it's somewhat impractical to use them. I do have high resolution
png files 10800x7200 pixels in size which are about 30 to 50 megs in
size.  Can they be used?

Thanks for letting me know if good linux image stitching software
exists.  I appreciate hearing from anyone who has done image --> movie
projects like this and what they used?

I e-mailed them and asked to be placed on a list for automatic notices
of meetings and other developments, if they have such a list. I will
definitely attend meetings and participate, but I need notices and
reminders. 

Meanwhile, I nominate Russell to place notices on the PLUG list. Better
I get a notice twice than not at all.

i have never used it for this purpose, but have you considered using
imagemagick?  it would stich all the pngs into one (something like
convert +append image1 image2 ... imagen output.png) and then chop it
up into a zillion pieces with geometries differing by a pixel or 5
(something like convert -crop -geometry XxY+Z+Q output.png 1.png;
convert -geometry XxY+(Z+1)+Q).  all command line and iterable.  you'd
end up with a zillion similar images that when appended into a movie
looked like panning, i think.

This will work very nicely, I just tried some command lines

% convert -append image1.png image2.png temp.png
% convert -crop XxY+HorizOffset+VertOffset frame1.png

for my selected XxY frame size and this works very nicely.

I can now make the 1,000's of frames for the mpeg movie.

Please consider this question closed.
