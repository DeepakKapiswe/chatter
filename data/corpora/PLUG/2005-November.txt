Absolutely.  I moved from Slackware to SuSE to FreeBSD; I've got 3 
machines running it at home (4.9, 5.4, 5-STABLE) and I think it's great.

Rpm dependencies? We ain't got no steenkin' rpm dependencies...

I started off with FreeBSD.  I found the Linux community MUCH friendlier 
to beginners. The documentation was more complete as well.  That was 
years ago.  I might take a little peek again to see if FreeBSD has 
changed as much as I have.

David,

   Do you know that there's an addition to Slackware that allows the use of
the NetBSD port system? I don't feel the need to go that route, but it was
suggested to me by an application developer in The Netherlands when I had
problems with his installer not installing the rc file. A simple 'touch'
fixed the problem and it works just fine now.

Probably not.  I think it's great, but FreeBSD isn't for everyone.  The 
documentation is still too sparse, and while I have never noticed any 
specific newbie-unfriendliness on the mailing lists I follow, that may be 
because I'm not a newbie.  It's not an OS I'd recommend to anyone with 
lots of multimedia toys or cutting-edge hardware, but that's not an issue 
for me - what I do care about is stability, speed, system transparency, 
and customizability.  And robust software install & upgrades.

Oh I didn't mean the FreeBSD crowd was UNFRIENDLY.  They just were no 
where NEAR as encouraging as the Linux community for newbies.  RTFM is a 
great answer if you already know enough to know WHICH "M" should be 
read.  If not it's a tad, well, sparse.

But I'm not a newbie anymore either.  This could be interesting and I've 
got a 10 gig partition just BEGGING for something to do....

Usually if there is some magic foo that's required look at
the /usr/share/doc/package-name directory for a file called
README.Debian.gz or something similar.  There is usually directions here
for what is required to make it work.

Little shell script magic should make this work I think:

 I am looking to set up an ftp and samba server for my network. Any idea
where I could find some information about setup configuration and execution
of the task.

I am fairly new to Linux although I am currently going to school majoring in
Linux Network Administration, so I do have some knowledge of how to get
around in Linux.

Obviously you haven't done that many windows installs, I've only ever
had that happen a few times, most of the other time, drivers had to be
tracked down, and a large number of times the install didn't work as
advertised causing more hair loss (mainly because the error messages
make no sense) trying to get it working.  Some drivers have to be loaded
during the install (mostly RAID controllers), and windows is so
antiquated that you still HAVE to use the floppy drive to load them.  A
large number of machines out there come with no floppy drive!

Since I am not a developer, I only look at what can be done with what is
out there now.  I have had the same load of Debian unstable for about 5
years now, it has not always worked 100%, but I have always been able to
fix it.  I have changed motherboards three times, video cards about five
times and have added and subtracted all kinks of peripheral hardware.
In the same time period I have had to reload windows at least a half
dozen times, talk about a monumental waste of time!

Anyway, I would rather take the time to recompile to a leaner faster
kernel that will be around for years than to have to deal with the
bizarre ways that Bill has found to screw up an OS.

If your lively hood is dependent on billable hours, then I would not
recommend using linux.  Windows will most definitely keep the customers
calling back.  This is kind of a strange industry, happy customers are
not the ones that keep calling back, they are the ones that have no
problems and only need to call you when they want to make changes.  This
leads to fewer billable hours per customer.

I feel your pain.

If grub is set up correctly it should ask if you want win or lin.  
Unless I am missing the point of all this.

I think Chris wants to be able to type a magic command in Linux, walk
away, and come back to a Windows boot.  lilo's -R option lets you
change the default for the next boot (Windows) without changing the
normal default (Linux).

Nope.  You'll still have to tell your mail system how to actually
pass mail through spamassassin.  The package's author wouldn't want
to presume, after all.  ;)

Me, I just use a procmail rule instead of installing SA sitewide.  
If I were just doing it on a desktop, I'd use a Spamassassin proxy
(google for it) or Evolution's built-in Spamassassin support.  See:
http://software.newsforge.com/software/05/07/01/1521254.shtml?tid=130

And unless you already have a special affinity for Sendmail, I implore
you to use Exim (Debian's default MTA) or Postfix (another popular
MTA).  It's much easier to configure them.

It depends on whether there's only one obvious way to hook it up (I
think PHP5 + Apache is in this category.)  If there's a bunch of
reasonable ways to do it (e.g. Spamassassin can be configured for
several different MTAs, as a proxy, as an individual filter or for
sitewide operation) then the package author will leave it to you, the
Mighty Sysadmin, to figure out where the tentacles and squeaky bits go.

Nope, didn't know that.  Does Slackware have a package management system 
these days?  I (obviously) haven't been keeping up.

The ports system is pretty neat - it really can fix a lot of the 
dependency hell issues that rpm's are prey to - the only drawback is that 
there can be a fair amount of compilation involved, so it helps to have a 
reasonably fast machine.  Upgrading / recompiling the base system on my 
IM/DNS/time server (a 10-yr old HP Pentium 100) takes about 24 hours.
But most of the work can be run by a cron job, so you're not wasting your 
time while the system is checking, fetching, & recompiling your stuff.

Now there's some flame bait. :-) Just to let you know that not 
everyone thinks as Aaron does, the first thing I do on Debian systems 
is ditch exim for sendmail. Unless you have a very vanilla setup, 
configuring either one takes homework.

You've got a special affinity for Sendmail?  I'm cool wid'dat, long as

My affinity is ... like this. I've recompiled sendmail less than once a
year for the last ten years. I've worked with aliases, local host names,
reconfiguring those stupid hash databases in a rather rudimentary
fashion. On a scale of one to ten, I'm about a three when it comes to
sendmail.

However, that's more experience than I have with Exim or Postfix.

That allows you to do what you want, but it might be simpler to do as
others have suggested and just pick Windows at the boot prompt.

slapt-get, actually.  A play on "apt-get".

FWIW, pkgtools is a package management system, IMHO.  :-)

   Yup. That's so common I overlook it. Thanks for the reminder. Pkgtools does
manage the packages, the others fetch 'em.

Subject: [PLUG] KDE 3.4.3, SuSE 9.1 - minimised apps vanish
Message-ID: <20051101215451.P9076@grond.sourballs.org>

I encountered a fascinating new problem tonight, in the process of 
unsuccessfully trying to install kstars on my spouse's SuSE 9.1 machine. 
It turned out I needed to upgrade the machine's version of KDE, which I 
did, and most everything seems fine... but now when I minimize running 
windows, they simply vanish - the apps are still running, I can see them 
in 'ps', but they disappear from the GUI completely.  No, they're not off 
on another desktop, nor obscured by the taskbar or other running windows - 
they're just gone, irretrievably, until the user logs off and back on, at 
which time KDE dutifully resurrects all the old windows.  This problem 
doesn't appear in fvwm or other window managers.  Clearly, something's 
gotten screwed up in KDE, but I'm not familiar enough with it to figure 
out what.

Can someone  with greater familiarity with KDE help me figure out what's 
going on here?  Thanks.

Does ALT-TAB bring them back?  Perhaps the applet that shows the
minimized applications needs to be re-added to the menubar in the new
KDE version?

It's usually called the "task bar" ... and I think it's part of "Kicker"
in KDE.

Do people still regularly use task bars?  I don't remember the last time
one did anything on my desktop except take up extra space.  I killed it
dead under XFce so I never have to see it again!  :-)

Are you sure it locked up, or just sat apparently doing nothing for a
while?  Total lock-ups are very rare with Linux (independent of the
distribution) and more often than not indicate a hardware problem.

Yes, that was exactly the problem, thanks. The new KDE didn't enable it by 
default, and after some hunting around I was able to restore it.

Yep, That's exactly what I'm looking for. And, thanks to you all, a good 
pointing in the right direction led me to "grub-reboot" where I can now 
do that. And for those who care, I'll be setting up that "very small 
shell script" tonight after work.

Thanks again.

I'm on the lookout for a wiki that can easily print sets of pages.  It's for
use as a documentation tool at work and people often want to print info out.
One at a time is too cumbersome.  The ideal solution would come as a debian
package and the feature should be built in or easily added as a plugin of
sorts.

Subject: [PLUG] Free wikis?
Message-ID: <4368B24B.26151.B2BC2D0@localhost>

<Slightly off-topic>

I am working on some instructions for students of linguistics 
regarding IPA fonts available, how to install them, and how to use 
them, including the good points and the bad points of each. The 
instructions will include Windows, Linux and Mac, and common 
applications on those platforms. Ideally I can post these on a wiki 
somewhere, then professors can point their students to the wiki. 

Does anyone know of a free and stable wiki where I can post these 
instructions? (Stable, as in "the site won't disappear in a couple of 
weeks when the person who started it loses interest.")

Google turned up a lot of wikis but they all seem to be commercial. 
I've read a lot of wikis, but this is the first time I've wanted to post 
on one. Any suggestions welcome.

Any particular reason to use a Wiki rather than a regular ol' static
webpage in your school or home webspace?  (I can think of some--easy
maintenance, can be handed off to another maintainer etc. but I'm
curious what your thinking is.)

   I downloaded and built memtest86-3.2 without problems. Because I could not
get lilo to run correctly with a memtest stanza, I made a bootable floppy and
rebooted my questionable box.

   What I see scrolling on the screen appear to be CPU registers: AX, BX, CX,
DX, etc. Does this mean it's running? When will it stop? I don't have a
command line at which to enter any commands as shown in the README file.

TIA,

   OK. That's a bad floppy. A new one seems to be working.

   I'd like to run this from the hard drive, but when I add a stanza to
/etc/lilo.conf, then try running /sbin/lilo, I'm told that 'memtest is not a
regular file or a block device.' What's going on? How do I get lilo to
recognize and use that stanza?

### LILO memtest section (memtest)
image = /boot/memtest.bin
label = memtest86

Did you remember to update lilo when you added the stanza??

   No. The README file says to write it this way:

image = /memtest
label = memtest

   The memtest.bin file is in /memtest, not in /boot.

   Per my original message, I noted that when I ran /sbin/lilo the error
message was generated.

Mediawiki can do what you're asking.  Check the Mediawiki-l archives for

The image needs to point to the executable...  Not the directory...


So If you  have it in /memtest   it should look like

image =/memtest/memtest.bin
label = memtest

It will keep running until you interrupt it. It does
not accept any other user input. Sometimes you have to
go through several cycles before bad RAM is detected
in this manner.

SuSE 10's first installation disk includes this test.
It's a lot to download, though, unless you intend to
install SuSE, too.

Because I don't know all the answers. I want several pages of 
information about the various free/pay fonts available, plus 
instructions on installing and using them on Linux, Windows and 
Mac, and then information on how to use them in various apps. I 
want something where the reader can edit the wiki to add his or her 
own information to the original. For example, I've never used a Mac. 
I'm going to have to leave that part blank for the moment because I 
have no idea how to install a font on a Mac. (And from talking to 
linguistics majors here, none of the Mac users knows either.) So 
hopefully a Mac user can add a paragraph or two about that issue. 

Because I want the reader to be able contribute, a wiki seemed the 
most appropriate venue.

I would like to order a palm device.  I noticed that in the specs on many of 
these devices Linux is not mentioned as an operating system that can be used 
to sync your device.  Does anyone have any experience using the palm tools on 
Debian Linux (Sarge) to sync their Palms and does it require geek status to 
get it going?

Thanks,

I'd strongly advise avoiding Exim. Given how good the packaging is I'm
disgusted that Debian continues to use Exim as the default. I doubt
Postfix is any more difficult with the packaging that has been done.
Though Exim /might/ be easier to setup, it most definitely isn't easier
to maintain. Notably Exim tends to requires security updates every 2-3
months, Sendmail and Postfix need updates around once a year.

Heck, with the packaging even Qmail isn't too bad to deal with.

I agree. Even for pretty simple setups I have to imagine Postfix doesn't
need significantly more work than Exim. I cannot be certain though as I
haven't fought Postfix.

Mike,

   We've used jpilot on the desktop since Judd first released it years ago.
The connection is via pilot-link which should be part of every distribution.
Over the years I've sync'd a Palm Persona, Professional, III, m105,
Handspring Visor Pro, and Kyocera QCP-6035 with nary a problem. If the PDA
runs a Palm OS, pilot-link and jpilot work just fine. We use both serial and
USB connections.

   Sometimes you have to add the users to the group owning the port, or you
can change the port's owner to yourself if you're the only user.

I use a fedora core 4 box at work, and I mainly use X to have lots of
vim sessions open at once on two monitors.  When I have vim running in
split-window mode, scrolling (holding down j, k or the up or down
arrows) is pretty slow and maxes out the cpu, much more so than just
holding down pageup or pagedown.  Any suggestions on why this should be
so?  Is it a video card problem?  We're using GeForce cards, and they
seem very happy otherwise.  

Any suggestions appreciated.

Make sure you aren't running over 60 hz refresh. Also, max resolution 
appears to be 1280x1024.

Is the behavior any different when using vi commands?
Ctrl + G takes you to the end of document (iirc).
Esc, : line_number; the Esc gets out of insert mode, and into command 
mode. The : puts you at the command prompt.
Not sure what that means either way, but I thought it was worth asking.

Yeah, (uppercase) G takes me straight to the bottom of the doc, and :1
to the first line.  No problem.  The issue is scrolling, not jumping
from place to place.  Should I be expecting it to be slow and
processor-intensive?

Subject: [PLUG] Comcast & Dealing with Unsolicited e-mail
Message-ID: <436A8584.9000606@comcast.net>

A few days ago I commented on e-mail I was getting with no subject, no 
sender, and no body text. The rate kept rising to the point where 
yesterday I was getting several every hour. I logged onto the Comcast 
e-mail system on the web and re-read what is offered for spam 
protection, hoping for a black list. Alas, there is none. Plus, their 
white list is an exclusive one: if you use it, you will only get e-mail 
from senders on the list. I asked them about it through their web site 
and got this as part of the reply:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your suggestion on how 
to improve our service with the popular suggestion of a "black list" 
type of mail filter. Yes other subscribers have also requested it and it 
is a popular request. We may have that feature with our mail in the 
future, but we did not have a time of if or when it could become 
available. I have forwarded your suggestion to the appropriate 
management team for further review and action. We appreciate your 
interest in making the Comcast High Speed Internet the best online 
experience possible.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been forwarding junk e-mail to missed-spam at comcast.net but it 
doesn't seem to have helped. If anything, the more I send them, the more 
junk mail I get!

One of the annoyances related to sending junk to missed-spam is having 
to do so one message at a time. So yesterday, I tried something 
different. I shut down T-bird for a few hours. Then, I logged onto the 
Comcast web mail system, checked all the above described junk mail (no 
subject...) and clicked on the "Report as Spam" button. I haven't gotten 
any of that kind of junk mail since. Maybe it's a coincidence, since 
they were doing some work on the e-mail system yesterday, but I'm a 
happier camper, today. We'll see how long that lasts.

Ah, but there's a subtle difference here.

They are all using the same kernel. So they all CAN use the same 
hardware. The difference being how the distribution chooses to compile 
the kernel.

If the distibution chooses to not include a section of code, that's the 
distibutions decision (and fault), not the kernels.

I agree. As long as the installer (created by the distribution, not the 
kernel maintainer) doesn't support your hardware, you have a problem. 
This is a problem by your choice, but it's still a problem.

I also realize that as long as computers don't work like toasters, there 
will be hardware that takes work to get to use. This is true even in the 
Windows world.

As I was commenting to someone just the other day...

There are those computer users that like to insert a CD, click 'Next' as 
fast as they can, as many times as needed, and it just works. Those are 
the same people that like Windows, and deal with instability as a result.

Subject: [PLUG] Has anyone written an open source viewer for Trimet
	schedules?
Message-ID: <20051104021604.GA27068@gate.kl-ic.com>


I plan to use the bus this weekend, and saw that Trimet has data
files for a proprietary PDA viewer.  Of course, you have to get
past a click-Agree-no-reverse-engineering EULA to get at the
data files, which are at:

http://www.secondkiss.com/trimet/download/palm_os/TriMet.zip
       (for palm .pdb files)

and

http://www.secondkiss.com/trimet/download/windows_mobile/TriMet.zip
       (for windoze CE .sgd files, allegedly using .NET somehow)


Now be good and remember to go to the EULA page first.  It would be
most unfortunate if you somehow found the data files above without
agreeing to the EULA and giving up your rights just so you can access
public information.  Please do not be sneaky and find the appropriate
links by reading the page source rather than clicking Agree...


All that said, it would be handy to read this information with
something besides a PDA.  Are there open source viewers that can
read these files, perhaps translating them into a spreadsheet
format, or front-ending for other processes?  The .pdb format looks
easy to take apart, and the .sgd files are supposedly Compact .NET . 
Seems like just the thing for an ambitious under-employed code
hacker...

Of course, once the tool was ready for demo, we could go straight to
Trimet and ask for this information in binary form, bypassing the
secondkiss website.  In particular, I imagine TriMet can construct
tables for all 60 or so stops on a typical bus line, allowing 
people to build more fine-grained and usable open source apps,
and we could make use of that data.

Trimet does put up the schedules in plain text form.  What about the web
browser interface doesn't work for you?

Or if you have a wireless pda, you can check the real-time estimate of
when the bus will get to a certain bus stop.  I think that there's a
way to get the same info from a cell phone as well.

You have to understand that the "build model" of linux is nothing like 
the build model of Windows. And, until recently, both were quite 
different from the Apple build model. Nothing magical or bad about any 
of them. They're just different, and they require different skillsets.

You seem to abhor having to know about your computer. On the other hand, 
I hate not being able to tinker with my computer. At the same time, I 
want my computer to work. I've found that after getting the system 
installed and configured, it stays installed and configured much longer 
with Linux than with Windows.

I have systems at work that get daily use, and have uptimes of more than 
500 days. None of the systems that I manage that have Windows will even 
get close to that length of uptime.

I propose that if you give it a real try, and make it work (as painful 
(or not)) as that may be, you'd find that you would end up with more 
billable hours than if you give into what appears to be the easy path.

Avoid the dark side, Luke. Or, avoid the noid.

Your choice. :)

Some would say that distributing a driver where you *can't* compile it 
is evil. I understand that some believe that closed source is a good 
thing, and I'm a "pro choice" type person. You have the choice to close 
your source or not. You have the choice to run Windows, Linux, *BSD, or 
Mac, among others. I don't complain about anyone's choice, until they 
ask me for help with their choice, and I don't agree with it. If they 
want my help, and I know they wouldn't be having the issue if they made 
a different choice, they can either listen to me complain about their 
choice, or make another choice. Either in what OS they use, or in who 
they ask for help. :)

As I said, getting the system installed and configured is a short term 
pain that lasts maybe a day or two, and results in a system that will 
serve for years. Windows may install quicker, but it results in a system 
that will serve for months, maybe a year, and will require much more 
care and vigilance.

Case in point. I don't have to run virus or other scanners on this 
system. None. Nada. The Windows machines on my network run virus 
scanners, spyware scanners, and I configure my mail server to watch for 
things so they won't get through to the windows boxes. If there were no 
Windows boxes, my maintenance on this network would be much less.

It's not arrogance. It's experience. I've been using computers since 
1974, Windows since 1993, and Linux since 1997. I understand that when 
you are starting out, figuring out the resources is difficult. I also 
know that finding the resources for Windows is difficult, unless you 
like going down to the local store and purchasing every piece of 
software you use.

Me? Almost everything I use comes with the distribution I use. One this 
system, NOTHING needed compiling. I didn't have to search for anything. 
All of my peripherals work. Including my firewire card, and my camera 
(USB) just works. OK, I wrote a shell script to download the pictures 
from my camera because I like processing my pics in one command.

You didn't ask for help. At least, not in the message I responded to. It 
looked to me like you were just complaining that Linux didn't work as 
you wanted it to. Nothing wrong with wanting to work as you would like 
to, but in this community, if it doesn't work like you want, you work to 
make it work that way. Bitching and $3.80 will get you a large Mocha at 
Coffee People.

First choose Portland, then click on a "yellow" dot to see price,

It would be very cool to "merge" these two concepts with a map:
. Vectors of each bus "route".
. Clickable dots for each bus "stop"; with schedules, photos, etc.
 
Trimet could further it with "real time" info.
Of course Bully Google would demand that Trimet accept their EULA.

In-Reply-To: <436AF3E8.3040909@dimstar.net>
Message-ID: <20051104173052.33968.qmail@web51806.mail.yahoo.com>

In light of the recent discussion on difficulties with Linux, I thought
I'd share my linux success story.

I'd been using Windows, and before that OS/2 and DOS, and was never
happy with Microsoft's poorly-designed software. I started using Linux
3 or 4 years ago, Red Hat 7.1 initially, partly because I wanted to try
something different that wouldn't crash constantly, and partly because
I wanted to learn it for work-related skills.

The first couple of weeks were pretty difficult, as things were
unfamiliar from the MS way of doing things, and nobody to hold my hand,
but after a short time I had the basics down. I installed a couple of
games (Quake3 and Return to Castle Wolfenstein), and was happily
surprised at the stability. RtCW in Windows would crash quite often,
maybe once an hour, initiating a 90-second process until I was back at
the desktop again. In Linux, I was able to play through the entire
single-player game without a single crash, which was a miracle compared
to what I was used to.

I've got a Red Hat 9 server that hosts my website, the websites of a
couple of friends and family, our e-mail server, and a file server. It
has run flawlessly, currently with an uptime of 223 days. The last two
times it was shut down were for a hardware change, and when we moved
last December.

I should point out that I have a wife and two sons, and we each have
our own computers. My oldest is more of a computer-geek, so started
using Linux soon after I did, in dual-boot mode so he'd have his games.
My youngest is more into just gaming, so in the past was mostly in
Windows, though his computer was also dual-boot. I wanted my wife to
try Linux, but knew I shouldn't force her. Well, about a year and a
half ago, her power supply died. I had a test machine running Suse all
set up, so I stuck it on her desk, set up Thunderbird for her, showed
her how to launch it, as well as Firefox, and showed her how to install
games through Yast. This "training" took about 10 minutes. Anyway, I
sat back and kept waiting for her to complain, but she didn't. After a
couple weeks, I asked her how she liked Linux, and she responded "It's
fine. Seems the same to me." I fixed her old computer, moved the Linux
drive to it, so she had dual-boot, but she ended up only going to
Windows for a couple of card-making programs. Her hard drive failed a
couple months ago, so I again gave her the spare computer with Linux
already on it. When I mentioned installing Windows again on her second
hard drive, she said to not bother, she never used it anyway.

Recently I did some major changes at home, creating an NIS server which
hosts all our /home folders, as well as a public folder, games folder,
and applications folder. The kids like how they can hop on any
computer, log in, and all their stuff is there: their files, music,
game settings and controls, bookmarks, etc. Also I've been installing
game after game onto the server. It is really nice for me, because I
only have to install the game once, on the network drive, then anyone
can play it. The kids love it too, because now we have a dozen good
games they can play: Quake2, 3 and 4, Doom3, Unreal Tournament 2004,
Neverwinter Nights, Americas Army, Oolite, Return to Castle
Wolfenstein, Cube, Eternal Lands and a couple others. I haven't seen
either kid in Windows for over a week.

The applications folder contains Firefox and Thunderbird, which makes
my job so much easier. I can patch or upgrade it in one place, and then
everyone is running the patched version. Another benefit is it is
painless to try out a different distribution on any workstation,
because all the user's data is saved on the network, as well as major
applications. Also it is easy to back up everyone's data just by
burning the /home partition on the server to a DVD.

There is one drawback I've found with this setup: if the network goes
down, everything goes down. I bought a cheap gigabit switch, which has
crashed on me a couple times during multi-gig file transfers. But as
long as the network is stable, things run really well.

Our servers run Red Hat 9 and Fedora Core 4, and all our workstations
run Suse 9.2, 9.3 and 10. Our firewall is Linux-based IPCop.

I hope this was interesting to someone. :)

-Scott

   Thanks for revealing the upside from a relatively new user point of view.

   On the subject of uptime with linux, I had a floppyfw setup that ran from 1
June 1999 until last August with only four reboots. The first occurred when
the original motherboard failed after seven months. That was replaced with a
Pentium MMX/200MHz (the least expensive I could find) and ran almost six
years until it died. The other reboots were caused by power outages in the
neighborhood during winter ice storms.

   After it died and was replace by a Netgear FVS-318 firewall appliance, I
took it outside and poured probably a kilogram of dust and dog fur from the
case. And it was still running floppyfw-1.09 with a 2.0.x kernel and keeping
out all the cracking attempts.

Carpe weekend,

Rich

Well .. some issuse with ubuntu cropped up.  Their forum was pretty
helpful actually and although one of the items didn't get resolved it
is pretty nice.

But have gone back to Fedora 4 as everything except the wireless works
right out of the box (err .. iso) on my laptop.  Found a guy who has
ideas on the wireless and is willing to help without telling me it is
free and open and .. <g>

no need to reply .. just posting for completeness. If you are having
problems getting a distro to load (even if you already have a linux
server (did if forget to mention that?) or have worked with computers
(hw and sw) for 30 years .. oh i like the mine is bigger than yours
discussions) .. try fedora 4.  It appears to currently to be the best
distro for hp zd laptops

I had an exchange with one of their reps several months ago.  They 
supposedly considered an open-source development but settled on 
licensing this third-party system because it was cheaper.

And it certainly is.  The viewer still doesn't work with the standard 
up/down buttons (I thought there was a palm widget for that.)  I also 
get some fun lockups in not-quite-reproducible combinations of looking 
at the schedule, clock, and home screen, depending I believe on the

running at the time.

If you don't mind losing the vector data (assuming that it actually *is* 
vectors), import into the gimp and crop.

I'm not immediately aware of any open-source vector editors that support 
pdf import.

Eric,

   Yeah, I do. LaTeX likes .eps, .pst, .pdf, and other vector formats much
better than it does raster formats. The resolution of the latter -- when it's
displaying lines and text projected on a large screen -- really decreases.
Why have typeset slides with poor quality graphics?

> I'm not immediately aware of any open-source vector editors that support

   I generated the figure with ipe, an open source vector editor. However, my
choice of "page" sizes are A4, A4R (it's written by Europeans), Letter,
800x600, 1024x768, and 1280x1024. That's great if the drawing fills an entire
page. Mine don't.

   As it turns out, while the figure float in LyX looks huge, the figures
display nicely in two-column arrangement on a slide.

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] awk and sed vs php
Message-ID: <1131139021.7676.8.camel@badger.had1.or.comcast.net.>

Good afternoon.

I have about 500 domain files that need modifications (changing the mail
server). So I need to change the serial number at the top of the file
and then, lower, change either the ip address of mail.domain.tld or
change the mx record to mail.standarddomain.tld. I don't have a
preference either way, I think they're about equal in the amount of
change I'll have to do later, so the result will depend on the ease of
scripting, because I'm just not going to hand edit 500 domain files.

I'm probably going to write said script in php, because I have php
installed as a cli, and it'll do the job, and I'm most familiar with it.
But I'd like to do it "right," with either sed or awk ('Right,' in this
case, means to me "more like a real systems administrator).. Perl's an
option of course, but I think sed/awk would be sufficient.

If I recall correctly, sed'll take an input file, and I can match
something like (^SOA ... 200\d+) and change it to the right serial
number. How do I go about writing this sort of sed recipe thing? I'm
thinking ...

for i in $(ls /var/named/db.*)
do
sed something < $i > b && mv b $i
done

Your help is appreciated. ;) Thanks.

   Thanks, Bill. Generating pdf files is not the problem; that's the native
format in which the drawings are saved by ipe. There's also pdftk, but it's
for working on multiple page pdf docs, not trimming a single page from letter
size to postcard size.

I'd recommend using something that will backup your files temporarily
until you are confident your commands executed correctly.  Check out
the --backup options to mv.

Actually, I've already made a backup of the files and would be

however, for the tip on the --backup flag.

If you're interested the oldie but goody 'linuxconf' will do it all in a 
scripted manner including updating the serial number.

	( http://www.solucorp.qc.ca/linuxconf/ )

I swept through 600-700, though they were split unevenly, on two systems 
changing all the MX records ( we had added in two spoolers ).  Took 
about 10 minutes on the bigger system once I figured out what I wanted 
and how to do it.

If you're interested I'll dig out the script or command line I used.

Of course there are lots of perl modules to handle DNS records also.

Message-ID: <63696.207.173.0.68.1131149041.squirrel@207.173.0.68>

How can I see what my size Linux TCP receive window is, when running a CLI
ftp client to a get a file from a server?

Am troubleshooting some throughput questions and want to adjust my TCP
window, or at least see what my Linux machine is using &/or negotiating on
a per-download basis.  Hopefully I can adjust the window manually for
testing.  Note these are all client sessions, not worried about using the
machine as a server.

More specifically am trying to find a formula or algorithm that will
predict download throughput with a given bandwidth, TCP window, and
measurable latency.

Thanks!

Does the window size have *any* effect on throughput assuming it is
large enough to be sane (as is the default)?  Unless you're dealing with
a long fat pipe or something, I suppose... been there, done that.  :-)

I think tcp_wmem (in /proc/sys/net/ipv4) might be what you want to
adjust to change the window size... but I'm not entirely sure there.
Google probably knows for sure.

In theory, if you set your TCP window size (or udp application handles
it properly) based on the BDP of pipe/rtt you should achieve as close
to possible of %100 of the (usable) bandwidth.  Basically, if you're
local you don't have to worry (unless you have thousands of clients
causing contention).  If you're running over long distance/latent
connection and you're not getting ~%95 of your bandwidth (presuming
you don't have a biased outbound flow clobbering ACK's), look up "BDP
tcp tuning" and for more info check the Web100.org

Cheers,

Oh, how I wish I could convert my SO. She's taking online classes from

to feel that MS Office is the only thing out there. The typing classes 
use this Windows only program.

Hense, I am stuck supporting a Windows machine because someone outside 
my sphere of influence requires it.

Another nice thing you'll like with this setup. If their computer dies, 
when you build them a new one, they log into their desktop and viola! 
all their stuff is still there. :)

I bought one of the Dell 24 port switches for home. It was $69 shipped, 
mounts in my rack, and has near wirespeed throughput.

I'm running Mandriva 2005LE for all my servers. I'll upgrade to 2006 
sometime soon. I also run IPCop for my firewall. I use the addon Block 
Out Traffic to limit the outbound traffic. I figure there are Windows 
machines on my network. If one of them gets infected with a virus and 
starts spewing mail across the net, I want to stop it.

After a little configuration to allow the apps I wanted, it seems to 
have worked really well.

And, don't forget SAMBA. If you have to support Winders machines you can 
still achieve much of the above when the Win machine dies. You'll still 
have to re-install all the Win software and set it up again, but if your 
users store their files on a SAMBA server, they'll still be there. I'm 
stuck with a number of Win98 machines in the house, and my primary one 
died this year. Since I've been kept my data on a SAMBA server, I was 
able to simply (well, I know that's not really accurate!) install and 
set up a "new" Win98 machine and keep working without having to try to 
salvage data from a dead machine.

Russ,

   What's wrong with her using OO.o?

Am not sure I get your question, clearly.  If you are asking "does the
linux window limit throughput needlessly", then I'd say no, the default
seems to be working just fine.  But my question is how to determine the
default tcp window setting, and how can I change it?

I am trying to gauge the speed impact of downloading the same large file
when it's 6ms away vs. 80ms away.  Next I'd like to explore how adjusting
the window further affects the througput.

As I was registering for this, I noticed that there was a question of  
whether Microsoft could share my info with other vendors. Heh.  
Sponsored by M$, eh? Well, before I noticed that, I did manage to say  
that I was interested in everything except WinNT/XP/CE and that the  
companies I wanted to visit were Monte Vista and Wind River (Monte  
Vista wasn't on the vendor list). When I looked on the program, I  
noticed that there weren't any Windoze sessions scheduled for either  
Portland or Vancouver, BC - just Seattle.

I don't suppose anyone will pay any attention, but I don't EVER see  
myself wanting to put any M$ code into any embedded or real-time  
systems that I get anywhere near.

Peace,
-Ron

Ethereal is a good tool for watching the tcp negotiation. The tunable

According to her instructors, she can't. No reason. Just don't do it.

I was a bit miffed at that.

Fortunately, she gets a student edition with one of her books. 
Otherwise, I'd have to use one of my MSDN licenses...

Well you could run tcpdump, for example:

jrmartin at matchbox:~$ sudo tcpdump port ftp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 96 bytes

Notice the "win 5840" and "win 5792", the advertised windows for my
system and kernel.org respectively.

But I doubt that those are what you care about, since they are dynamic
and change depending on how many outstanding packets haven't been
processed.  You probably want the send and receive buffer sizes,
SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF, set by the application.  I don't see a way to
set them for my ftp client, but you can change the system-wide
defaults in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem and
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem.

The bandwidth-delay product is what you're looking for.  Basically if
your window is smaller than the bandwidth * delay then you will not
keep the pipe full.  This might help you:

Pretty much.  In general, it would look like

sed -e 's/regex_for_old_string/new_string/' $i > tmp && mv tmp $i


or, if you wanted to apply the transform to certain lines, rather than 
every line, you can pass in a regex to match those lines:

sed -e '/line_regex/s/regex_for_old_string/new_string/' $i > tmp && mv tmp $i

   I'm using a Netgear VFS-318 not only as the firewall but also as the switch
for the internal network. I've realized that the internal data transfer rates
are terribly slow: less than 100 Kb/sec, not the several Mb/sec I used to see
with the LinkSys switches. Despite my looking at the admin pages, I cannot
find anything mis-configured that would explain these slow speeds.

   Some of you use this appliance, and I'm hoping you might have some insight
to share with me on how to improve the intranet data transfer speeds.

Thanks,

Rich

A very small amount. In the source code, there's a fairly large set of 
regression tests; I bet one of them tests scatterplotting.

Yeah, I've used it quite a bit, but not an every day thing.

The y-axis is normally at zero on a plot. If R is giving you something 
else, try this:

 > plot(x, y, pch=".", ylim=c(0, max(y))

The 'pch="."' piece makes the points small dots rather than the default 
circles. If you like the default circles (I don't) just leave that out. 
And if you have a better upper limit than the maximum of y, substitute 
that as the second argument of the 'c' function call.

I've been using R for about five years; please feel free to pick my 
brain off list or on list.

One other tip ... type

That will bring up an HTML help page with links to all the manuals,

Thanks - I wasn't thinking in R enough to get the format for ylim correct. 
Now it's doing what I need. BTW, in my version of R, the default limits 
appear to be data-derived, rather than starting at 0.

> One other tip ... type

yup, found it - unfortunately it's such a mass of information that it can 
be difficult to isolate the stuff I'm looking for (searching for 'xlim' 
returns nothing, for example).

Bill Ensley of Bear Printing ( http://www.bearprinting.com) delivered
500 full color two sided PLUG business cards to the PLUG meeting
business cards.  Those of you who were at the meeting for the Asterisk
presentation got some to pass on to friends and cow orkers.  I expect
most of the rest to get passed out at ITEC in December, and at Powell's
Techical books.  If you want some before they disappear, contact me. 
The image of the cards can be found at:

So special thanks to Bill for doing the printing!  Bill has been hit
with a lot of pre-Christmas business, and worked some extra long hours
to get these cards to us.  He was so sleep deprived, he left his laptop
in the PSU meeting room, but fortunately it was still there when he
returned to look for it. 

When the Christmas rush is over, let's send some more work Bill's way!

The FVS318 doesn't have much in the way of any fancy features. I would check 
what the MTU setting is for the LAN. I have mine set to "default" and the 
transfers are pretty decent between other systems on my network. I have my 
cable modem connected to my FVS318 and it is the central switch in my home 
LAN. I do lots of large file transfers from my laptop to my workstation and 
my laptop is on 802.11g and I get several megabits per second on my large 
"scp" copies.

I've also used the same router in a small office with desktops and servers all 
connected to an FVS318 and there weren't any complains about internal network 
speed. We have a fractional T1 running into the office and so people 
complained about slow downloads from outside the office.

I've got a version 1 of the FVS318 hardware and it's running version 2.4 of 
the Netgear firmware. They've since upgraded the hardware and in newer 
versions they support HTTPS for the web administration page.

You could also use the -i and do away with the temp file altogether.

I don't know much about PHP, but I gave up awk and sed almost a decade 
ago for Perl 4. I still occasionally use sed, but I haven't written an 
awk script since about 1994.

Tony,

   The MTU setting is the default.

   This is strange, taking time I'd rather spend on other things, and just
plain annoying.

Rich -

Can you check the interface statistics on one of your systems to see
if you are getting any Ethernet errors?  Meaning run traffic for a
while and then check ifconfig and ethtool -S.  Perhaps your system or
the switch are causing errors.  You could also try a different
cable(s).

Do you have another small switch you could try temporarily to verify
it is the router?

Jason,

   On my main workstation/server I see no errors from ifconfig. ethtool shows:

[root at salmo ~]# ethtool -S eth0
NIC statistics:
      early_rx: 0
      tx_buf_mapped: 0
      tx_timeouts: 0
      rx_lost_in_ring: 0

   On the other workstation ifconfig shows 1 RX packet error and ethtool
reports no stats available.

   The notebook also shows no stats available.

   I copied (via scp) security upgrades from the server to the other two
hosts. The files were moving to the other workstation at about 46KB/s and to
the notebook at about 48KB/s. These are much slower than previous.

> Do you have another small switch you could try temporarily to verify it is

   This evening I'll dig one out of storage in the garage and give it a try.

Thanks,

Rich

Jason,

   On the workstation whose motherboard I suspect of being weak (or broken), I
cannot get any stats with 'ethtool eth0'. And, I cannot set the speed with
'ethtool -s eth0 speed 100': "Cannot get current device settings: Operation
not supported." The notebook reports the same as the server/workstation. Both
reporting hosts show set speeds of 100 MB/s and full duplex.

HI

I am running    2.6.12-9-k7-smp



My NIC card is 3c59x Vortex

The kernel will not load it...

Modules that try to load. are

3c59x not used

mii.  which is used by 3c59x...  <which is not used>

I can't do an insmod 3c59x..Complains.. No such device..

The problem is.. for some reason the card has no MAC address..

Earlier kernels just complained 

loaded the driver and didn't come up

I could change the MAC address, by hand  and
then bring the card up..


This kernel will not let me do that...

How do I get around this??


Thanks

Vram

What does lspci show for the PCI ID for the 3Com?  I have a 3Com NIC
that doesn't have a MAC address either, and the same card also comes
up with a PCI ID of 0xffff:

0000:00:13.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c905 100BaseTX [Boomerang]
0000:00:14.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation: Unknown device ffff (rev 78)

Notice the top one is working fine (lspci -n shows the PCI ID for that
one is 0x9050).  If that's the case for you the 3c59x driver won't
recognize the device without hacking the driver source to "recognize"
0xffff as one of the devices it supports.  To do that you need to know
EXACTLY what the card is, to make sure the driver uses the right
features.  My two cards aren't the same, so it took a while to figure
out what the bottom one is supposed to be.

I'd bet the flash that stores the MAC address and such is fried.  If
it's for anything production you'd probably better buy a new card :-(

Well that blows my theory.  I dunno what to tell you other than either
a) your hardware is broken or b) figure out what changed between the
kernels that worked and the one that doesn't.

Does anyone on the list own a Dell Precision M70 and gotten
suspend-to-disk and/or suspend-to-ram to work properly under linux?

How about under windows?

There seem to be some intractably hairy issues with getting this to
work, at least under linux.

Any help/hints would be appreciated.

That is the hard part..

It shows up but, won't load the driver...

I am trying to check the difference between kernels to see if I can spot
a difference there..

It is not a BIG deal.. Not a production machine..  PCI nic cards are
$20 or if I run down to FreeGeek I can probably get it for less..

Thanks

Jason,

   I went spelunking in one of the storage boxes in the garage and came up
with a LinkSys 4-port switch. I put two workstations and a notebook on that
switch, then connected it to the Netgear multi-box.

   Re-copying a bunch of security upgrades from the main workstation/server to
the other workstation reached speeds of 1.7MB/s, up from the 46KB/s of the
Netgear alone. So, it must be the FVS318.

   Fortunately, the Netgear is under warranty until July 2009. Unfortunately,
this is the second defective FVS318 in succession. The first one worked fine
as an internal switch, but would not connect to the DSL bridge. When my http
download speeds are double the internal file copies it's not a Good Thing.

Thanks,

Rich

I was having a very similar problem and was certain it was one of my many 
cobbled switches.

Turned out, I had a bad NIC in one of my machines that was somehow 
degrading the performance across the board.

The problem went unnoticed on low bandwidth applications, but caused 
massive problems when the bandwidth went up.  There was some discussion of 
the problem here.  I solved it with a $15 NIC.

Jeme,

   Would a defective NIC throttle transfers when they're passed directly
through the Netgear box but not when they go through a switch? Host-to-host
transfers now go through the switch and bypass the Netgear.

Well I've never owned a Netgear (at least not since the days of 10Mbps
hubs), nor do I even know what your model is capable of, but I'm still
impressed by my good ol' trusty Linksys WRT54G.  Wired connections for
me, wireless for my wife's laptop (and mine on rare occasions), and
with the Sveasoft firmware I get QoS, statically configured DHCP tied
by MAC address, DNS caching, and even a local DNS domain, all
controlled through a web interface that is almost as intuative as the
original Linksys interface.  If I was more ambitious I could run Snort
on it.  Definitely worth the $50-70 or whatever it costs these days.

Message-ID: <20051107215932.GA10818@gate.kl-ic.com>


I am currently running my Apache server on a virtual host at Vcolo.com,
on a UML with 64MB of memory and 128MB of swap.  Lately, the system has
been running out of memory during nightly backups, which brings down
postfix and sometimes the VPN connection.  I am getting so many
hundreds of spam attempts per minute (most of which are killed before
processing, but...) that postfix can be quite a resource hog .  
I modified the backup control script so that postfix is shut down
during the backups and restarted after (with a later restart in
the crontab in case the backups wedge).


However, Apache is also a memory hog (20 4MB child processes!!!).  I
run 7 low-usage websites on that server, but do not get too many hits
per minute - usually spiders.  I doubt I need that many child processes.
I do use viewcvs and subversion and wiki and https and a bunch of 
other enhancements running, so I can't turn off many of the modules.

To keep Apache in bounds, I went into /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and
reduced some of the settings:

...
<IfModule prefork.c>
# StartServers       8
# MinSpareServers    5
# MaxSpareServers   20
# MaxClients       150
# MaxRequestsPerChild  1000
StartServers       2             
MinSpareServers    2
MaxSpareServers    3
MaxClients        15
MaxRequestsPerChild  100
</IfModule>
...

Does this look reasonable?  The sites still seem quite responsive.
Are there better ways to slim down Apache?

I can't speak to slimming apache down but I would consider increasing 
MaxRequestsPerChild to its former value as it controls the number of 
requests each child handles until it gets killed and a new one started. 
  Unless you have a memory leak a value of 1000 is reasonable, though if 
you have a memory leak setting MaxRequestsPerChild to a low number is 
treating the symptom not the problem, but you probably knew that.

There are a few httpds (thttpd, lighttpd, others probably) that are 
smaller than apache and may fit your needs.

I don't know how up to date it is, but the Linux STD (security tools
distro) disk has a bunch of white hat/grey hat tools.  It's a knoppix
variant that is aimed at security and penetration testing.  Maybe surf
distrowatch and see if there are other security oriented
distributions.  They'd have rootkits as examples, and maybe further
info on where to get them

Have you checked out MDB tools?  http://mdbtools.sourceforge.net/
I've been meaning to try it out.

Also, I've heard a rumor that OpenOffice 2 supports Access databases.

I'll be curious to know what works,

Thanks, I've grabbed it out of CVS and will play with it in between  
dealing with realtors and banks.

OOo 2 does support Access on Windows. The Mac version doesn't support  
it, unfortunately and that's what I need right now. I'll see if I can  
get it to compile/run with Xcode.

Message-ID: <1131484335.8387.10.camel@badger.had1.or.comcast.net.>

One of the weak points in this application my new 'work' ( for lack of a
better word ) is how it handles named. Basically, the application is a
dynamic domain purchase and hosting provisioning thing. With every
purchase of a domain, this thing rewrites the /etc/named.conf file and
writes a new master file for the named demon, then restarts named.

You can imagine my worries if this thing ever gets the traffic they
would like to see.

But aside from those worries, it's kind of messy. For one thing, there's
a flaw somewhere in it (I think directly in a perl module) that causes
the named files to be written missing a space (for which I have to go in
and fix them): like ...(ipaddress)"IN ...

Eons ago, when I was still young, I recall something about hearings
someone make Bind work with Mysql; if I could have named take the
entries right out of the database, I would have one less point of
failure. And it might be easier to make sweeping changes like "change
all of these mail servers to this ip address."

Has anyone worked with the MysqlBind project from openISP* ? Anyone have
any other resources? 

Yer help, as always, is appreciated.

This is probably out of scope, but are you stuck with bind and named?

I use a dns called powerdns and it uses MySql natively for its domain

There is also tinydns ( http://www.tinydns.org/ ) which has a very

You may be able to reduce the size of each apache process by not loading
modules that you are not using.

The 3c59x driver covers all the "Vortex" and "Boomerang" NICs,
including some 3c9xx cards.  The name is slightly misleading :-)  The
comments at the top of the driver code describe which NICs it
supports, e.g:

I've been using BIND-DLZ with Postgres a bit.  It works OK.  Just
remember to index your DNS tables or the loadavg will be pretty high.

http://bind-dlz.sourceforge.net/

Basically, it patches BIND so it can use any number of different
backends.  It hits the backend store every time, so you can
dynamically update DNS entries.

Lucky me, I seem to have won a bid on these damn things:

I don't really know what they are. I do know that the racks at our coloc

10 of these. And anything that promises cable organization (via nyties /
zip strips) is good in my book).

I won the lot for 10 bucks, packing is 3 and shipping is 17. So I'm
paying 30 bucks for the ten. I figure that I only need 2 or at most 4,
so I'd be willing to part with the remainders (I certainly don't want

   This morning I've encountered an inability to reach any web site with
firefox or 'ping.' This has happened a few times before, but usually on a
Sunday morning. Privoxy reports that the name does not resolve so I assume
it's a name server issue.

   Locally, dnscache is running. Can I assume, therefore, that the problem is
with Aracnet's DNS servers? In the past instances service has been restored
in a few hours so it's never been fatal. But, it's annoying nevertheless.

   Has anyone else encountered this inability to reach httpd servers? Is there
anything I can do from here to resolve the issue? Obviously, mail and other
'Net services work just fine.

If you've narrowed the problem down to an inability to resolve domain
names, I would start figuring out what link in your DNS chain is down.
The possible culprits include your local configuration on your computer,
any local DNS services (like the local "dnscache"), and your ISP's DNS
servers.

What happens when you skip dnscache?

What happens if you try a different set of DNS servers?

What to DNS tools such as "dig" tell you about your ability to resolve
things at various levels?

Rob,

   The inability to resolve domain names is what privoxy reports.

> What happens when you skip dnscache?

   Haven't tried it.

   Did not rearrange /etc/resolv.conf to try the others.

   Dig, host, whois all work fine.

   Today access came back quickly. It's not a critical issue but an annoying
one that I'd like to understand if I can. I doubt it's anything here and
wonder if this is a common occurrence.

Thanks,

   Other 'Net services work continuously, it's only the http that drops out

As a point of reference I had issues with Verizon's DNS servers
flaking out periodically for a short while as you describe until I
enabled the caching name server on my router.  Now it is pretty rare
for me to notice it, I guess I'm fairly predictable in my web surfing
routine :-)

I am not familiar with dnscache, does it have it's own timeout period
or does it use the TTL for each record?  Could it perhaps need to have
a longer caching time?

And the For Dummies question is:  Is your system actually *using*
dnscache for lookups?

Jason,

   Verizon owns the pipe between me and my ISP. I don't use their DNS servers
at all.

> does it use the TTL for each record? Could it perhaps need to have a longer

   I'm not sure. It's Dan Bernstein's effort and an excellent product.

> for lookups?

   I presume so. Haven't thought of testing it.

   Again, this is something that happened three times in the past. Twice were
early Sunday mornings two weeks in a row, once was my floppyfw having failed,
and now today. The access always comes back up, but I'm just curious what
causes this sporatic outage.

   The next time it happens, if I remember I'll try IP addresses instead of
domain names. If that works then we know it's a DNS server issue.

Thanks,

Rich

As I understand it, dnscache doesn't consult other recursive DNS 
servers- queries are resolved from the root servers.  The ISP's servers 
shouldn't affect the behavior of dnscache.  If you can perform lookups 
on outside DNS servers with dig, then perhaps dnscache is wedged.

I've found that dnscache will not respond to requests if there is no 
disk space left on the log partition.  I run dnscache on my diskless 
firewall, and sometimes a heavy week of usage will fill /var/log before 
log rotation clears space.  I think my distribution runs a log rotation 
cron weekly on Sunday mornings...

2, 3, or 4 of the quads, and I want to convert each address to CIDR. For
example, if I have 123.456 I'd like to convert that to 123.256.0.0/16; if
it's 123.456.789, then I'd like to convert that to 123.456.789.0/24.

   I know there are multiple tools to do this; I suspect that sed would be the
simplest. Am I better off searching for each group separately (e.g., all /16
separate from all /24 and all /32)? Suggestions appreciated.

Message-ID: <20051110185451.GE18975@peak.org>

I'm looking to build a fanless Linux box, probably based on a Mini-ITX
board, and want to get the parts in Portland.  Can anybody recommend a
shop that 1) knows what supports Linux (or can look it up); carries
Mini-ITX boards, cases, etc; and 3) is open on Saturdays?

Thanks,

Eric,

   Both ENU and Pacific Solutions have linux-knowledgeable sales staff. Give
'em a call and see if they meet the rest of your criteria. ENU east side is
open on Saturdays; I suspect that PS is, too.

Rich,

Just a couple of quick thoughts:
Remember that the CIDR notation isn't nailed to the dotted quad format
so just getting the quads won't do it.  It's either going to take a
heck of an if statement or you might want to convert the dotted quad
to a 32 bit number, then convert that to binary, then convert THAT to
a string.  Then count zeros from the right.  For that kind of
crunching I'd rather use python or even (if forced) perl.  Certainly a
shell script could do it.  I'd just rather have the flexibility of a
full scripting language.

I don't know how you got the data but remember that addess 123.456.789
might be from domain 123.456.  Therefore the CIDR would be 123.456/16,
not 123.456.789/24.

John,

   Perhaps explaing the context would help. These IP address blocks are in
/etc/postfix/badip. For some reason, postfix client_access and sender_access
checks have stopped working; it may be that headers and body are base64
encoded, but I don't know. (There's one domain that sends stuff almost every
day and it used to be rejected, but now it makes it in despite the domain
name and IP address block in the restrictions.) So, I already have a large
list of quads in this file.

   That's very true. But, I probably don't want to block all IP addresses in
the 123.456/16 range, just those in the more restricted 123.456.789/24 range.
There are also a lot of addresses in the /32 range.

   As I wrote, this all used to work well but something changed and I'm not
sufficiently knowledgeable to track it all down. So, I'm changing the badip
map from a hash to cidr format.

Thanks,

Rich

What is your end state goal here?  Blocking traffic from subnets? 
Blocking spammers sending?

The only place I have found Mini-ITX boards is at Fry's.  Even then
the ones they carry have fans.

I think so.  This looks like a one-off, so just do a clever
search-and-replace in vi or something.  If you want to repeat it,
port your vi searches to sed.

Since this is, as you mentioned, a spam-blocking application, you may
want to a) throw out all but the /32s; b) consider using one of the
fine DNSBL services that do all this work for you for free; c) use
the very cool temporary-blocklist firewall technique Randal Schwarz
described at a recent AT.

Options a) and c) will not do much against spam sent to his personal email
account (without accompanying other, invalid addresses) so we should add
in d) deploy dspam, bogofilter or other intelligent spam learning ware.

   I have several RBLs that are checked, and I'm tuning SpamAssassin's rules,
too. This current effort is an attempt to fix what used to work but has
become ineffective, probably because of how spam messages are being
constructed.

Someone correct if I am wrong

But, classful    Class A is   0 to 127  With 0 and 127 abstaining.

Therefore with classful  notation you could say 123.456.789.0/8

But, given 123.456.789.0

I have NO idea what is happening till you give me THE MASK..



My story and I am sticking with it...

   This afternoon I download and installed 'boa constructor', a python IDE.
Then I worked my way through the tutorial. Everything went very well, except
that the menus are not working as intended. The "Help" menu should have only
an "About" choice, but it has "Help", a separator bar, then "About". The
"File" menu will not display at all.

   The code looks OK to me, but ... obviously I cannot see the error. The
tarball of source is 1.6K. I'd appreciate if someone could look at it and
tell me why it's broken. I've posted a message to the boa-constructor mail
list, but it's a burr under my saddle.

Thanks,

Rich

Just so you don't feel all alone I'm just getting back into Python after

Or if you're looking to carpool up give me a hollar via E-Mail.

I'm looking to go either Tuesday or Wednesday, and spend the majority of

John,

   I figured out that problem, but now I have a bunch more.

   The menu problem was solved by changing the wx.Menu value on the
constructor tab of the inspector window to the specific menu item. I know
that's confusing, but I was looking on the properties tab at the incorrect
attribute.

   Now I have code without a defined global 'self', without a proper _init_,
and other errors. I've no idea how I incorrectly translated the tutorial
example into what I need for the application, but I certainly did. Sigh.

That's an odd url.  What port does the ncftp:// protocol use?

Your (root's?) ~/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm should have a 'urllist' array 
reference in the Config = { ... } hash somewhere.

...
  'urllist' => [
         "ftp://archive.progeny.com/CPAN/",
         "http://cpan.develooper.com/",
         "http://www.perl.com/CPAN/",
   ],
...

You can also use the ("o conf urllist push ftp://myurl/") instructions 
that it gives you in the error message, provided that you start the 
shell ("perl -MCPAN -e shell")

If you're on debian (or most distros for that matter) you will find a 
ready-made package for common modules.

I was happily putting our new server up at our colocation and discovered
that the sliding drawer mount things that are supposed to go on the
sides of the rackmount case are too long for our rack.

We have 19" rack at TimeWarner Telecom downtown; I measured our rails
and they're about 28.75 inches deep, somewhere around an inch and a half
too long. The spiffy new server will fit, barely, but these rails won't.

Would either of these places have those things? Or where is a good place
to shop for them?

Thanks :)

I'm a newbie to this list.  Tonight, my RH9 system is
broken.  When I try to boot it, I get the following
message: "warning: unable to open an initial console"
and the boot process hangs forever.  This system is my

and web and listserv server so it is pretty important
that I get it up and running soon.  I need some advice
really fast.  I need to come up with an approach to
getting the system running and recovering my web site.
 I might even be able to come up with MONEY for the
right kind of help.

Thanks in advance,

No, but I did have a problem with the second drive

I am not up in single mode.  I am running from
recovery mode on the install CDROM.  I can see mounted

fstab or some of the other filesystems that are
supposed to be there.

Still can't boot.  Same error message.  I built
another Linux system on the old second drive.  I
mounted the suspect drive and can see the files now. 
That is, I can see all the files except my web site! 
Not sure what the deal is with that.  I sure hope they
are still on the drive or I'm totally screwed.

That's really messed up.  Go into interactive mode:

        perl -MCPAN -e shell

and then reconfigure it with:

        o conf init

and answer all the questions *carefully*, and then:

        o conf commit

I can answer that for him without even seeing it.  Yes ( or at the least 
from a Dell wantabe ).  Been there, done that, own several tee-shirts.
   My experience with TWT is they used telephony racks/cabinets which 
made things even more interesting.  Ended up putting shelves in the 
cabinets and using standard cases.

First of all, thanks to all of you who gave me advice,
help and hand-holding last night.  I am still unable
to boot to my original HDD but I have made a little
progress.  I mounted that drive to another Linux
system and I can see most of the files.  Most.  The
missing filesets are all of the data files from my web
site (about 8000 html files and associated images). 
Something nasty must have happened during the aborted
dd backup process is all I can figure.  Now I'm in
deep doo-doo.  My latest backup is months old and (of
course) I have done MAJOR surgery to the site since
then.  I cannot re-create most of it. 

I'm wondering if anyone knows of a good local data
recovery outfit that I can contact?  Fingers crossed
that the files are still there.

I recently purchased a Shuttle ST62K from Fry's - it is one of the
older and slower and less expensive miniITX boxes, and it does have
a fan.  However, the fan is pretty quiet.  It fires up relatively
loudly when the machine boots, then slows during normal operation. 
With the case on, the single fan is somewhat quieter than the house's
central air heating duct, which is pretty good for a 2GHz+ Pentium.

You are not likely to find a faster machine without a fan of some
sort.  The ST62K has a heat pipe from the CPU chip to the main fan,
so there are not multiple fans making noise at least.  This machine
will be going into my wife's office, and she likes quiet.

I remember there were issues with drivers - I had to use Fedora core
4 and tweak with the X configuration, older distros did not work.
But maybe that's just me.  I don't have sound working yet - but as
I said, my wife likes quiet.  The ST62K video DAC is a little wussy,
and consequently the pixels are not very sharp, which can lead to Moire
effects on an LCD monitor.  If you find a low power unit with a DVI
connector, or an AGP slot, I would be interested in hearing about it.

Be attentive to chipsets and drivers.  The mini-ITX units use weird
chipsets to reduce power, and there may be driver issues with the
unit you select - sorta like some laptops only worse.

Is _that_ what it is? Well, the new server is from Penguin Computing.
It's really spiffy. The racks on the other hand don't match my limited
previous experience with racks. I can't describe what they look like- I
keep meaning to take photos. Some of the previous servers have
rails/shelves but others are (ahem) just sitting on other servers.

This sounds like a clip from the 'why to get spinrite' literature... 
Has anyone here used it?

http://www.grc.com/sr/spinrite.htm

a linuxjournal review is here:

http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7684

This seems to be a great tool for hardware errors on a drive (I
haven't used it, but I've heard nothing but glowing reviews).  If
'something went wrong during dd' means data got overwritten, "ow..."

So, what follows is sort of SPAM, but at least interesting SPAM.

Here is something I think your LUG will find interesting.

Project BlackDog Contest Begins - $50,000 Grand Prize to be Awarded

Realm Systems has announced the start of Project BlackDog, a skills contest offering prizes in five categories, including a $50,000 grand prize for the best application created or ported to run on BlackDog?.

BlackDog is a pocket-sized, self-contained server with a built-in biometric reader and Debian-based Linux operating system. Unlike any other mobile computing device, BlackDog contains its own processor, memory and storage, and is completely powered by the
 USB port of a host computer with no external power adapter required.

Complete contest rules, product information, and ordering information can be found at www.projectblackdog.com.

Steve

***The DAM Book: Digital Asset Management for Photographers
Publisher: O'Reilly
ISBN: 0596100183
In the world of digital photography, Digital Asset Management (DAM)
refers to every part of the process that follows the taking of the

scans, or stores digital photographs is practicing some form of DAM, but
most of us are not doing so systematically or efficiently. In "The DAM
Book: Digital Asset Management for Photographers," photographer Peter
Krogh presents a solid plan and practical advice on how to file, find,
protect, and re-use photographs, focusing on best practices for digital
photographers using Adobe Photoshop CS2.

***Control Freaks: Modding and the Clash with Law 
Modders, and the millions more who possess a natural creativity and an

things has become one of the fastest up-and-coming social trends in the
US, and thus has drawn the litigious eye of large entertainment and
media companies. Andy remains optimistic, however, that modders
themselves can find ways to shift the focus away from modding as a legal
issue, and toward a view of modding as a social and business issue.

Hmm, mixed prognosis here. On one hand a `dd` mistake could do massive
damage. On the other hand, the fact that there is enough present to get
you the error message you've seen is hopeful.

So standard recovery methods. Don't do anything that writes to the drive.
Use dd/dd_rescue to copy raw images of the involved filesystems to
another drive. Run `fsck -f` on a copy of the filesystems. This should
hopefully retrieve most of the files (I'm guessing you destroyed
metadata, the files /might/ still be present).

Then you get onto rebuilding. Sounds like your root filesystem is
sufficiently toast that a bare-metal reinstall is really needed. For a
quick fix, your original installation method should work. For long term
I'd think in terms of going for either a recent Fedora or perhaps Debian.
I'd suggest Debian, sounds like you've the experience to take it on, and
over the long-term very little maintenance is needed.

Subject: [PLUG] UPS for linux
Message-ID: <BAY108-F3FC28E15DE359FDC376FAB85B0@phx.gbl>


Hi:

I am hoping to get one of those UPS that would not
only protect against sudden power outage
but also automatically performs graceful shutdown.

I tried one earlier this year that had a Linux software
(using SNMP via serial interface to the UPS) but did not
work very well.  And their tech support was less than helpful.
I dropped the issue but I need to pick it up
again since I do really need one that works this time.

Can anyone suggest an UPS  with Linux control software to perform
graceful shutdown (that you have tried and happy to recommend)?

thanks

--Vincent

Vincent,

   Yup. The APC Smart-UPS series. I bought a refurbished 1400VA model along
with the serial cable. I've set up apcupsd on the server (directly connected
to the UPS via cable) and on the other host (as a slave without a direct
connection). The APC hardware is very well designed and made (I had bad
experiences with Tripp-Lite years ago), their linux daemon is very well
documented, and there are several rebuilders that sell refurbished units with
new batteries and a warranty for a very reasonable price. They also will
reboot the system when the power returns ... I think. I'd have to look that
one up again.

   Get plenty of spare capacity. I'm running a total of 700W (maximum) power
supplies on a UPS rated for 1,000W.

Subject: [PLUG] Very Strange Problems With Two Apps
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0511131107120.16710@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have problems with two applications (well, one now as I've switched from
one to the other) that no one else can replicate. It is quite frustrating and
I've no idea how to isolate the cause.

   Both applications create GUIs in python. The one I had been using (wxGlade)
is a designer and I was not able to enter label values in lists (such as
wx.RadioBox, wx.ListBox, and the like). This used to work but no longer does.
After a couple of days of not getting anything done, I switched to Boa
Constructor which is a full IDE (apparently modeled on Delphi, but I never
used that so I take the author's word for it). So far, I like Boa better than
Spe.

   Anyway, in Boa I created a wx.Dialog and entered title text. But, now I
cannot select the text in the Designer frame. When I do select it (from the
object tab in the Inspector window) and try to move it, the handles disappear
as soon as I left click within the box. I also cannot select multiple
attributes; trying to select a second one (holding the shift key while left
clicking on a different attribute) replaces the original one with the new
one.

   No other application I run under X exhibits this recalcitrant behavior.
Others have no problems running the same versions. I'm using Slackware-10.2
with the 2.4.31 kernel, 1G RAM, and Xfce-4.2.1 so the problem should not be
related to too little memory or an old kernel or desktop manager.

   Any thoughts?

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] qmail hostname and domain confusion
In-Reply-To: <OMEBINHFEBMFOKIAIEADOEJHDLAA.ble.nordlund@verizon.net>
Message-ID: <OMEBINHFEBMFOKIAIEADIEJIDLAA.ble.nordlund@verizon.net>


All-
I was hoping someone could provide a brief bonehead-level  primer on setting
up qmail, or see something wrong in what I have tried to do.  I am trying to
set up qmail, vpopmail, and courier POP/IMAP.  Although I am doing this in
gentoo, I am pretty sure my confusion transcends distro-specific issues, so
any input would be appreciated.

I have followed the gentoo qmail-howto at
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/qmail-howto.xml .  However, the way I read it
there seems to be some blur between the hostname of the server and the
domain being served.  To start, there is a section explaining that if
# hostname --fqdn
returns "localhost" that I should check /etc/hostname or /etc/hosts and my
DNS to make sure "everything is correct".  Then once I have "checked" then
edit the config files in /var/qmail/control.  There is also a reference that
the file /var/qmail/control/me should contain the hostname.  Now for the
confusion:

There are samples of what the /var/qmail/control files should contain, which
is where I get confused.  There are examples to be used if you are doing a
"2nd level domain" followed by examples for doing a third level domain:

2nd level domain examples:
# hostname --fqdn
should return "wh0rd.org"
# cat me
should contain "wh0rd.org"
# cat defaultdomain
should contain "wh0rd.org"
# cat plusdomain
should contain "wh0rd.org"
# cat locals
should contain "wh0rd.org"
# cat rcpthosts
should contain "wh0rd.org"

Now tell me if I'm a complete loon, but it looks to me like we are mixing
the definition of host and domain.  In order to force # hostname --fqdn to
return "wh0rd.org" wouldn't I be using a domain name for my server?  Maybe
the example for 3rd level domains is a little less confusing:

3rd level domain examples:
# hostname --fqdn
should return "mail.wh0rd.org"
# cat me
should contain "mail.wh0rd.org"
# cat defaultdomain
should contain "wh0rd.org"
# cat plusdomain
should contain "wh0rd.org"
# cat locals
should contain "mail.wh0rd.org"
# cat rcpthosts
should contain "mail.wh0rd.org"


.....Starting here, I will be referring to my real domain name
("towermonky.com") rather than the "wh0rd.org"  from the howto.......

I guess the 3rd level domain examples makes a little more sense to me in
that it looks like where we are concerned with host names, we are actually
using a full hostname and where we are talking about domain names, we use
what looks like a domain name.  However, according to the help above, I have
fixed these files, but "# hostname --fqdn" continues to return "localhost".
Apparently the recommendation to "fix" /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts means to
go in and edit them.  However, I wouldn't be crazy enough to think I need to
edit them so that the only hostname for the server would be
"mail.towermonkey.com".  I can't imagine how many things I would break by
doing that!  Anyway, my /etc/hostname file includes a single line
"hrimgerth", which is the hostname my machine has had forever.  I don't know
if I should be including both "hrimgerth" and "mail" or if that would be a
mistake.  Part of my confusion is that it doesn't make any sense to me for
my multi-purpose machine (smb file server,  printer server, etc) to now have
to only have a single hostname of "mail.towermonkey.com" for all these other
services.  I thought a machine could have several aliases, including
localhost, mail, hrimgerth, etc, etc.  Now for my /etc/hosts:

127.0.0.1 localhost hrimgerth localhost.localdomain
192.168.30.2 nisse
.... (other hosts skipped).....
192.168.30.5 hrimgerth mail mail.towermonkey.com
////(IPV^ section skipped)....

I hope at this point someone has seen something that is obviously out of
line and can steer me in the right direction.  The operational issue I have
is that no mail clients can log in using POP or IMAP or SMTP, so based on
some of the howtos and help files I have read I think they are being refused
because they are not seen as being from the right domain.

Thanks for enduring such a long posting.  Any pointers?

Thanks,
Brian.

Brian,

   The hostname should be the name of the machine itself, not just
'localhost.' If it's a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), then it would be
of the form mehost.example.com; localhost.localdomain is a synonym.

   Your domain should be your equivalent of example.com. The hostname is the
particular host that holds the mail server (MTA).

   See above; first paragraph.

   Then your domain name is towermonky.com and the FQDN would be
mail.towermonky.com (or the actual name of the machine.)

I recommend Network UPS Tools: http://www.networkupstools.org/ and any
of the supported UPS brands.  A note WRT APC: the low-end models, in
addition to being kinda lousy as a UPS, also tend to have USB monitor
interfaces, which when I checked a few months ago we're not as well
supported as the serial.

Does any know what prx.php and prx1.php are/do?  There is no file like 
that but I get  a lot of request for it.  The all get 404 response.

I own a number of APC UPS for the many and most of the companies I've done 
work for over the last 10 years have used APC UPS boxes as well. For Linux 
support I like to use "apcupsd" which is monitoring daemon for APC boxes.

It's quite configurable via a configuration file and allows a Linux system to 
be shutdown based on your preferences. You can have it signal your system to 
shutdown based on how long its been running on battery or even better IMHO is 
when the battery level is below a certain point.  I don't know if most 
distros include it precompiled or not but I usually obtain the source code 
and compile it myself. 

"apcupsd" can also be setup in a client/server setup which I find useful in 
cases where I have a large UPS that can support multiple systems. One system 
with the signaling cable monitors the UPS and the other systems are clients 
and receive notifications from the server system. An important point to 
consider when using a network to signal other systems is to ensure that the 
switch the systems are using for their network connection should also be on 
an UPS otherwise signaling will be lost during a power failure.

I've used "apcupsd" with both serial and USB signling cables without any 
issues. Some of the newer APC BackUPS RS-1500 and XS-1500 only support a USB 
signaling cable. I had to specify that I wanted USB support through the 
configuration script that setups up the build environment.

At one time APC had a version of their PowerChute software that ran under 
Linux and I was using that but that was more than 4 years ago and when I 
found myself needing a UPS monitor again sometime later I found "apcupsd". 
There's not fancy GUI or anything but it does the job just for all of the 
systems I've managed over the last few years.

are they "GET prx.php" requests or "GET http://umsky.com:80/prx.php" (or 
something like that) requests?  If it's the later somebody might be 
probing to see if you're a proxy and umsky.com/prx.php returns some info 
that might be useful for that kind of activity.  If it's the former I 
have no idea.

Might it be an attempt to exploit one of the recently patched PHP
vulnerabilities?

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3388
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3389
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3390

I don't have anything in my Apache logs along those lines.

If you give your logs a good look, you will most likely find references 
to all kinds of "stuff" in there.  I run a check daily looking for 404 
errors with an associated .exe or .cgi or .pl associated with them.  
These are caused by someone up to no good.  I trap their IP address and 
exclude them from my web site from then on with the Deny <IP> directive.

Well, if I couldn't get any luck after I'd tried all the tricks for
tweaking rack brackets, I had to order Dell adapter brackets from
http://www.racksolutions.com/

The stuff worked fine.  They make a kit with a bunch of different size
adapters in it that's well worth the investment.  Gives you an oidea
of all the sizes, gives you leftovers for the next time you need 'em
and saves you from the risk of ordering the wrong sizes.

Sorry, but they're not available locally.

APC SmartUPS.  FreeGeek sells used, tested ones but you may have to
get your own special serial cable.

For software, I strongly recommend NUT.  http://www.networkupstools.org/

Supports lots of different UPSes and allows you to shut down multiple
PCs if they're all plugged into the same UPS.  Also there are some
nice monitoring widgets that talk to NUT.

Been there too.  In one situation it was two ( or three ) rack mount 
cases sitting on top of each other.  Now that you mention this I 
remember that the TWT cabinets were 23 inch not 19 so for the few bits 
of equipment that _had_ to be rack-mounted there were "adapters". 
Pieces of sheet steel with holes to connect to the cabinet frames and 
the equipment's rack-mount hardware.  Kludgy for sure.

Some vendors supply rails in different lengths. And most rails can
be adjusted +- a few inches.

If just needing a couple inches, use a spacer, but ! you have to be
careful in that you now have to add the bolt/spacer to the loading
calculation. This is a lawyer infested world.

Any decent hardware store will have what you need. In a pinch I've
even used over sized nuts to build up a spacer.

Subject: [PLUG] Researching webmail security...
Message-ID: <1131911099.437797bbe85c9@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I want to set up Horde Webmail IMP to authenticate to an abbreviated
password file.  A file that doesn't have the game, bin, uucp, lpr etc.
users.

Googling, two other webmail packages were recommended, pimp and Aeromail.
I don't know if I should switch.

I'm using imp-3.2.1-1 via an rpm from horde.org that I can't seem to
find anymore.  My server runs Redhat 7.3, that's partially why my
IMP version is so old.

There is authentication to database, but that seems far too involved and
complex.

For some networks, it makes sense security wise to allow unpriviledged
accounts webmail access, but not the administrative accounts.  It 
doesn't make sense to me to allow login via a non mail user account.  
One way to protect against Internet abuse of an administrative 
account, don't allow Internet logins to it.

I may need to authenticate to two or more abbreviated password files based
on which network a client is on.

Why doesn't ls -l show all permissions if there are special sticky bits?
Is there a command that will show these bits?

If you know what you're doing building surge suppression, ac/dc conversion,
and power boost circuitry, you can make your own.  I have an APC smart UPS
su1000net which works well using nuts, but I need to replace the battery
and it appears that these aren't made anymore.  The other thing you're 
going to want to make if you roll your own ups is a serial ciruit that
will communicate with Linux so that you can do graceful shutdowns.

If someone were smart, they'd start a business making usb UPS'es 
specifically for Linux.  I wish someone would do the same for
multi function all in one printers/scanners/fax/copy machines 
as well.

Find an APC smart ups that signals over a serial line, I found mine on
E-Bay.  Longer term, I hope we don't all have to roll our own.

Yeah, I noticed this with my company's web server.  Another admin had
accidentally opened up a proxy and I'd had to close it a while ago,
but there were still lots of broadband-connected hosts (infected
Winders boxes, I 'spect) hitting various proxy-test and ISS exploit
URLs.

No real harm, except that it cluttered the logs.

Subject: [PLUG] Undelete with Samba
Message-ID: <4379047B.6040403@comcast.net>

Using Windows Explorer on Win98SE, I've just deleted a recent (in other 
words, not backed up) file from a Samba shared directory on an EXT-2 
file system. It's not critical if I can't recover it, but I figured this 
is a good example to learn on.

So far, nothing's been written to that drive since the deletion. I've 
searched "undelete" on the Linux specific part of Google, and have 
started following the instructions at:

http://www.linux.com/howtos/Ext2fs-Undeletion-4.shtml

As the file resides on my 60MB drive, debugfs: lsdel is taking some time.

Is there a better way? The last time I had occasion to do this sort of 
thing was many years ago on a DOS machine where it was a simple matter 
of using some Norton tool and changing the deleted flag on the filename. 
I was hoping for something equally as simple, but I realize that may be 
wishful thinking.

Anyway, any alternative recommendations will be gratefully received.

Newer versions of samba support some of the windows vfs object
specifications.  I used the following within the smb.conf for a client
to achieve a recyclebin function so that things aren't directly deleted
just as is normal operations under a windows desktop.

        # the options below are what will implement the recycle bin.
        vfs object = recycle

Thanks. This looks like it could be a useful tool. Will it work with 
Samba version 2.0.7? The machine in question is running RH 7.0. I tried 
using new versions of Linux, but since it is only a 200 MHz machine, and 
I use it to drive the stereo in the living room, I had to go back to RH 
7.0 due to "latency" problems (at least that's what I think it's called 
-- it produces sound with skips and jitters).

I succeeded in recovering the file. It was only one block big, so I was 
able to use the dump command in debugfs to write out a copy of it.

Problem is you're most likely to catch worms and zombies this way, than
do any real good. In the case of dialup systems you're going to have to
block large numbers of IP addresses, and you get a lot of uninvolved
parties.

Better is to provide an alert to the poor sap whose machine has been
turned into swiss cheese. In this general category was the classic of
creating a 64KB file of zeros named "default.ida", because this crashed
the worm.

Yeah, you're probably right, but with my hobby website I don't really

Subject: [PLUG] Sticky bits...
Message-ID: <s378d79a.005@mail.touchstonetech.com>

The "1" in 1777 is the sticky bit... so called because of its antiquated
use in causing executable files to "stick" in swap space.  Linux
apparently ignores the sticky bit set on files.

When the sticky bit is set on a (shared) directory, the files within the
directory can only be renamed or deleted by the file owner, the
directory owner, or root.  Obviously, the term "sticky bit" comes from
the older use of the bit.

The execute permission for world is coded as T when the sticky bit is
set, and as t when both the sticky and executable is set.

I think I had to do this to get my mailer working.  What's the 1 all
about?

Why doesn't ls -l show all permissions if there are special sticky bits?
Is there a command that will show these bits?

I still need a speaker.  I have been fighting a cold, so it has been

Message-ID: <BAY108-F39CA32E100A0DC40BBBF1B85D0@phx.gbl>


Hi:

We have an Apache web server that housing a page
on a tool that our team developed and available for download.
One team members is presenting that in Japan
this week so we are starting to see some hits from Japan.
Some of those hits, however, are not resolvable.  My httpd
logs them as IP (instead of host name), and then
I use the logresolve tool to convert them to hostnames.
I grabbed a few of them and ran them through nslookup
only to confirm that I cannot resolve them.

Is there any way I can resolve these IPs back to their hostnames?

Thanks in advance for any tips...

They probably don't have hostnames, or rDNS set up at least.

Subject: [PLUG] What to do when you can't find the author?
Message-ID: <437A0BA7.9080507@acm.org>

Not strickly Linux but semi-(F)OSS related.

The author of some JavaScript code seems to have disappeared off the 
face of the earth.  This is not the first time.  His domain has gone 
south before.  The previous time a whois turned it up and a few 
days/weeks later it turned up again at a different hosting company. 
There are gory details but I won't bore you with them.

That time I was trying to get in contact with him about some ( paying ) 
work to add and fix functionality in the code.  Even after his domain 
returned I could get no replys to email.

This time I went looking for the online documentation and now the domain 
doesn't even show up in a whois.  ( Much of the site is saved at 
archive.org ).

Enough background.  So I have copies of the files and want to add and 
correct some functionality in the code and possibly release it.  Where 
do I stand legally since it is not OSS?  All he asked is that he be 
recognized as the author and if it was used commercially make a 
"donation" of $5 - $30 per application it is used in ( via. PayPal ).

Semi-gory details.  The code package is fValidate.  The author is Peter 
Bailey.  The domain is peterbailey.net .

Thoughts, ideas, and off list if this is too off topic.

You could try putting this email up on a page and google bombing it
with his name ;)
(Google-message?)  Anyway, I've always wondered if that would work :)

BTW, there's a couple other things happening that night that techies
might be interested in:

There's an IEEE talk on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles at OGI (off hwy 26 at
185th St. out past Beavertron).  Talk starts around 6:30.

Wish I could be there, but instead I'm going to a US DOE talk on
industrial energy efficiency and management.  It's at the Red Lion,
with dinner at 6 and the talk around 6:30 or 7.

Oh, and if enyone remembers the fine A-T talk on using a Linux cluster
to simulate EMI exposure for high-voltage linemen, there's an IEEE
talk on that today up by Lloyd Center from 12:30 - 1:30.


The days are just packed,

Nope.  I don't know what you need the hostnames for, but you can get
info on the addresses' owners with whois.  Just don't abuse whois--use
it once for each IP range, rather than for each and every address.

   This is far from my areas of expertise so I'm easily confused. Why does one
need to be in Bellevue to do this work? As long as one has access to the 'Net
and ssh -- plus a working telephone connection -- can't the coordination,
code writing, testing, and whatever be done remotely? Heck, you could even
keep in touch using RPC. :-)

... including his cell phone number (214-XXX-XXXX Dallas TX area).  
"whois fvalidate.com" lists contact information for him, in Plano
(a suburb NE of Dallas), and an email address on gmail, most 
recently changed in April 2005.  I suggest trying those. 

If THAT comes up empty, you might send an email to the North
Texas Linux User's Group ( ntlug.org ) and ask them if anyone
knows of him and his current status, or of the name of any
Java users groups that cover that portion of Dallas.

Is there a registered copyright?  Is the source open (that is, readable
and available) but not free?  If Mr Bailey has gone to the Great Coding
Project In The Sky, there might be some issues with releasing the exact
same code on another site, but probably no major problem if you
refactored the code significantly enough, then started a fork under an open
source license.

Or, since he retains copyright and may be commercializing his code, you
may find that the fValidate.com site comes up in a few weeks with an
order form for the code - $99 down, $99 a month for 99 year.  Paranoia...

----

About 1.5 years ago, JW Schultz of (IP address near the Bay Area) died.
It took nearly 6 months to learn the facts of his death, since he was
so very private and secretive that we did not even know his first name. 
However, his dirvish code was open source, so I put it up on a server
and opened it up to development, during the time we were waiting for
more info.  After about a year of public involvement, we have 87 users
on the mailing list and contributions coming in from all over the world,
as well as some pretty significant wins at high profile sites ( OSU
OSL, Berkeley, Cambridge, Dutch Public Television, etc).  
 
That is what open source permits.  If you don't like your own work
or data getting dragged down when another project's leader goes
[ missing | insane | dead ], consider investing your time in something
with an open source license rather than something closed or encumbered. 
There may be enough other users of fValidate in the same pickle that
you can work together to write a replacement, if Mr. Bailey is no
longer able to support you.

One needs to be in Bellevue because it is a requirement to fill the 
position according to the person who will be filling it. As long as 
there are qualified candidates in Bellevue, there is no need to search 
outside of Bellevue. It is, and always has been, and always will be, an 
employer's market.

My advice would be to throw away any components of questionable support 
or legality and re-create their functionality from scratch. Software is 
about communication between people and between people and machines. In 
the absence of communication and legally documented rights, what you 
have is a ticking time bomb. Get rid of it *now*!

Also, in order to get them to comply, you have to be in range to hit
them with a stick.

A very BIG stick.

Wow!  I should have guessed you would think of the right magic.  It 
never even occured to me to look for fvalidate.com.  Plus 1and1 was the 
"last" hosting company.

I'll give the gmail account a try.

We can implement a non(or low)-alcoholic version of this as long as 
Elliot doesn't have to drive.  Maybe it's "Elliot interrupts with a non 
sequitur, Elliot takes a number of drinks equal to how many words were 
left in your sentence."  Of course, the non-drinkers would have to buy 
Elliot drinks.  We'll convene a committee before the games begin to 
establish the by-laws, ok?

And so I called both.  ENU doesn't do Mini-ITX, but Pacific Solutions

Subject: [PLUG] dansguardian and K12LTSP
Message-ID: <437CDBD5.2090509@acm.org>

At our last user meeting ( North Idaho Linux User Group - nilug.org ) we 
tried to get dansguardian working with a k12ltsp server and thin clients.

We would prefer having it all happen on the server without dealing with 
configuring firefox and locking it down for each user.

Lots of searches and reading turned up conflicting information; from 
using ipchains ( verses iptables ) to "it should work out of the box." 
None of them worked.

We, all that were actively working on this, agreed that whiskey wouldn't 
help and aspirin were not as enjoyable ( for the iptables stuff. )  Lots 
of head aches.

Has anyone on the list done this?

There is a server with two NICs -- eth0 connected to a switch and the 
thin clients and eth1 connected to "the Internet".  Since this is going 
into a "shelter" the configuration needs to be simple and robust. ( Did 
I just say Linux? ).


TIA,
Rod

Subject: [PLUG] device and inode number to filename?
Message-ID: <200511171314.54377.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Hi all,

I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to reach into the depths of a 
filesystem and pull out every filename which is linked to a given inode 
without walking the tree.

I've found some references to an "ncheck" command (that maybe was on 
HPUX?)  So maybe no way to find the source.  It sounded like debugfs -R 
"ncheck <number>" <device> was going to do the trick, but it only 
prints the name of the first file (and continues to do so even when 
only other links (or even no links) remain.)

I realize that it might not be possible to do this in a fs-agnostic way, 
but having never written my own filesystem, I might just need to get 
knocked with a cluestick (e.g. there is no indexed inode table?)  That, 
or maybe someone could tell me the secret code (er, jargon) that 
unlocks the google easter-egg for this level.

Thanks,
Eric

Not quite sure what you've after, but you can build a mapping from
filename to inode, e.g. using find, but it does involve walking the
tree.  I don't think the filesystem bothers to maintain the reverse
mapping (inode->fname).

  $ find . -inum <n>

Keith,

   There are a number of books by the author of Tcl/Tk, but why learn that?
Tcl is quite limited as a scripting language compared with python, perl, and
all the rest. Tk is very low level (near Xlib) and does not have the widget
support of GTK+2, wxWidgets, Qt, or even FLTK.

   I started down the Tcl/Tk path about eight years ago and quickly
backtracked for (my then needs) GTK+. Now I'm wrestling with wxPython.

Yeah ... Tk isn't too bad, but Tcl is a ghastly scripting language. The 
best book I've found so far on Tk is the big O'Reilly one on Perl/Tk. 
Most of the other scripting languages duplicate the Perl interface, so, 
for example, if you want to use Ruby, you'll still want the Perl/Tk book.

The big thing Tk has going for it is that it's ubiquitous, like Perl. 
Instant GUI. But yes, there are much better looking GUI toolkits out 
there. I'm partial to Qt because I'm also partial to KDE, and because 
there's a really good book at Pragmatic Programmers on QT with Ruby. So 
for the near term, that's the way I'm going.

First, you probably want to ask K12LTSP questions on the K12LTSP list...

Second, you can't have both thin clients and transparent proxying
on the same server. You need to keep the two functions seperate. [1]

K12LTSP is setup to do transparent proxying with squidGuard, but it is
easy to adapt it to Dan's Guardian. Make sure you have the squidguard
package installed, then edit /etc/init.d/transparent-proxying and
change the two references to "--to-port 3128" to "--to-port 8080".
Then start it up...

 	/sbin/chkconfig transparent-proxying on
 	/sbin/service transparent-proxying start


-Eric

[1] technically speaking it *can* be done on a single server, but that
     requires a non-standard iptables module & significant know-how.

Be sure you get "Mastering Perl/Tk", which is the upgrade (complete

 Prefer open source solution.
Conect to and from both Linux and Windows computers.
Easy to use by end users.
 This means minimal set up issues by Windows end users trying to connect
from home to work.
Works through most peoples "firewall/routers" at home.
Authentication against Windows active directory would be great.
 I could live with a comercial appliance, but don't want to pay extra per
client.
I've seen some canned (netgear) "firewall/routers" that have built in VPN
but they appear to be optomized for a client that you have to pay a license
fee for every client machine.
 While open vpn (http://openvpn.net) doesn't seem to meet all the list

Use TightVNC.

It works on windows and linux and also has an applet that runs through any

This lets you VNC into it from any web browser anywhere.

Sometime last night my wife's UPS died. It's a Belkin Model F6C525-SER. 
I'll have to look for the manual for it -- their web site's search

pdf file called, "Any Belkin Data Recovery Warranty."

At this point, what I'd like to find out is whether the battery died, or 
something else in the unit died, and then whether I should replace the 
battery or the whole unit.

Can anyone recommend educational reading on the selection, care and 
feeding of UPS's?

The Linux 2.6 kernel series has a built-in IPSec implementation 
enabled in most distributions' kernels. It gets managed with the 
racoon(8) key-management daemon. Configuring the server side isn't 
trivial, but "road warrior" clients should work pretty easily.

See http://ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net/ for overall information and 
source code. See the Linux Advanced Routing & Traffic Control HOWTO 
(esp. chapter 7) for configuration details:

Dick,

   It's usually the battery that goes. I'd pull the battery out and put a
volt meter across the terminals. If the needle doesn't budge, or moves only a
little, it's a good indication the battery is deceased.

As always, it depends on how it failed.  If it won't run the computer
unless it's plugged-in, it's almost certainly the battery.

Even if you can find a replacement battery, a whole new UPS won't cost
much more, will have a warranty and will be safer.  Replace the whole unit.

You can browse APC's site, but there really isn't much to do--plug it
in, test regularly and expect the battery to die after 2-5 years.

The best technical minds available tell us that the Linux Clinic turns ten 
this month (earliest Usenet announcement found was November 1995.) In case 
you don't, Eric, Paul, and I have been doing this gig for roughly nine of 
those ten years - which is a long time. We're pretty burnt out and would 
like a rest. Here's the deal, we plan on calling it quits after the 
November session (which is tomorrow). If someone's interested in taking 
over the Clinic, then please contact David Mandel. Remember, if you're 
considering this, you need to find a new site.

Thanks to Paul Nelson for giving us access to Riverdale's computer labs 
and for being there month after month to help. Thanks to Eric Harrison who 
has been the technical heart and soul of the Clinic. Thanks to John Bruce 
for spending all those Saturdays burning CDs for us.

Lastly, I would like to thank the many members of PLUG who took the time 
to come down and help over the years. I would try to list all the people 
who were especially helpful, but I don't want to insult anyone by leaving 
them out. Thanks everyone!

Dan,

   From one who has been the recipient of help several times, and offered help
when I could, I want to thank you, Eric, and Paul for your time, efforts, and
commitment to the group.

   Attendence at the clinic has ranged from so crowded that we'd have to go
into the hall to change our minds to a handful of us waiting for someone to
come in and ask for help. Through all this, the three of you have remained
cheerful, helpful, and available.

   A Golden Penguin to each of you.

Thanks,

Rich

Many thanks to all of the organizers, and volunteers, and to Paul for 
hosting the clinics. I gained much from the handful of times I took 
advantage of the assembled wisdom.

Three cheers for the Clinic crew!

I've only attended a half-dozen or so clinics over the past eight 
years (missed the first couple years :-), but there's no doubt in my 
mind that Dan, Eric, Paul, and a rotating cast of PLUG members 
provided an incredibly useful service to the Free software community.

Installing Linux is much easier today than it was back in the days of 
hand-writing every config file, frantically figuring out drive 
geometries and monitor scan rates, and consulting modem manuals to get 
"AT" strings that worked. The Clinic saw us through those days, with 
much bonhomie added to the technical help!

Thanks to all!

As Bones said to Capt. Kirk, "He's dead, Jim." A dvm shows a short jump 
up to between 0.4 and 1.0 volts, and in less than a second drops to zero.

I also asked:

To which Aaron replied:

OK. That takes care of the care and feeding part. How about the 
selection part. Other than manufacturer's sites, does anyone know of a 
site that discusses the selection of a UPS?

I recall measuring the current draw of my equipment some years ago, and 
I should probably do that again, since I've changed a number of things. 
But, other than that, and some idea of how long I want the thing to keep 
my machine running, are there any other things I should be thinking about?

Rich, I think you mentioned buying refurbished units. Did you say where 
you got them? Did they come with any warranties?

   Not really. But, UPSs are rated in VA units which are somehow different
from Watts. About 40 years ago when I had my Ham radio license, W=VA.
Regardless, VA > W in ratings. I believe the APC site has a table that shows
the wattage as well as the volt-amp rating.

   Have spare capacity. No guidelines, but enough so that you can plug in more
equipment in the future, or load up the boxes you have.

> Rich, I think you mentioned buying refurbished units. Did you say where you
> got them? Did they come with any warranties?

   No, I did not specify. I bought from RefurbUPS.com
<http://www.refurbups.com/> and am very pleased with the service and prices.
The unit I bought was the APC Smart-UPS 1400, for about the current $199.99
(plus a lot of shipping; it's heavy). That's rated at 950W/1400VA. They have
a Smart-UPS 1000 (670W/1000VA) and only 46 pounds instead of 58 pounds for
$179.99. They refurbish the electronics, put in a new battery, and test the
units before shipping.

   The apcupsd software works just fine with them.

I think it meets everything except authenticating against MS AD...
OpenVPN primarily uses keys for authentication.  However, if you could

My recollection is that for DC, VA = Watts, but that for AC, there are 
other factors (I think I know which, but am reluctant to say) that fall 
into a category similar to the one about which my high school physics 
teacher said, "the student may ignore the effects of friction for the 
purpose of the exercise," but that in real life, for large 
installations, one may not. (The funeral for that sentence, which has 
been taken out and shot, will be held tomorrow.)

Of course, there are manufacturer's sites, like the aforementioned
APC.  Their info is on the up-and-up, so look there.

Basically, a UPS has two ratings: VA* (how much power it can supply)
and battery life (for how long).  Add up the wattage ratings of all
the power supplies you'll be plugging in, then look at UPSes with at
least that VA rating.  Pick out one that'll supply somewhat more than
your wattage for at least 10 minutes or double your typical outage time.

Choose carefully what you plug in.  Network equipment-yes; monitor-yes;
speakers-maybe; inkjet printer-maybe; laser printer-no.

Single-PC-sized UPSes are available for <$100 at Office Despot these
days, but if you need cheap, FreeGeek has tested units at their store.

Good luck,
  Aaron


* VA is (peak volts)*(peak amps), about 1.4*Watts.  Given engineering
  tolerances and the fact that power supplies rarely operate at full
  load, there's some slack here.

Now that you mention them I recall that these are the basic criteria I 
used the last time I went through this exercise.

Didn't you say this was your "wife's" UPS?  Why are you concerned with 
all the tech behind it?  Just replace the battery and be done with it. 
If you want a slightly better unit then get something like a SmartUPS 
that has a battery health indicator on the front.

Oo

Nope.  I'm just saying that it seems like you have a really simple need 
here.  Anyway, the link I provided was to a battery shop on 82nd.  You 
can get something with a higher mAh rating than the battery that came 
with your UPS, which will give you a longer runtime.

Now, if you had a rack full of equipment and required a guaranteed 
uptime of 5 minutes or so for the generators to fully kick in then I can 
see going through some specs like this.  My wife has a laptop though. 
UPS = integrated.

Almost all of my "outages" are less than a couple seconds.  The rest
tend to be longer than any affordable batteries will last, so for me I
guess endurance doesn't really enter the equation seriously.  If I was
monitoring for automatic shutdown, which I am not nowadays, then I'd
only need enough endurance to complete the shutdown.  As it is, either
I am present and can do something, like go to the basement and reset
the breaker or shutdown the machines manually, or I am not and it

True. It is a simple need. And we've pretty much decided that the simple 
thing to do is to go to Office Depot and get a new unit. The old one is 
probably nearing 5 years of age, and a new one will have a new warranty, 
and cost around the same as a replacement battery. The only thing we 
want to check is if the battery can handle startup current for the 
monitor. We discovered that it couldn't handle it for a 17" View Sonic. 
On the other hand, there's a note tacked under the monitor that 
instructs my wife as to the Win-98 keystrokes needed to shut down the 
computer if the monitor is off. She doesn't tend to leave programs 
running if she shuts down the monitor, so this is a practical alternative.

This pretty much describes our operation, too. The only thing I should 
do is read up on the Linux software for monitoring outages and shutting 
down at least the Linux machine that runs as a house server. The rest 
typically have one of us sitting in front of them when significant data 
files are open.

Thanks. I sent an e-mail to their tech support and got that link from 
them earlier. The troubleshooting guide confirmed that it is probably 
just the battery that's bad.

If a new unit makes more sense (after we check the cost vs. the cost of 
a new battery - $40 something from Belkin, haven't checked the folks on 
82nd) then I'll keep that in mind.

I don't have exact dates, but if anyone's been collecting stuff, this

With that there, we might swing a visit to the regular meeting.

   There's also NW Battery on Belmont and NE 37th (did I get it right this
time, Galen?). I've bought from them before and they're good folk.

jdub chatted with me about this at the Ubuntu Below Zero conference
in Montreal[1]. He didn't have a firm schedule then (he was canceling
a trip to Korea in order to come to a non-BadgerBadgerBadgerTour 
meeting in PDX)

I should have the details in the near future. I hope we can at least
have a second-stage PLUG meeting (luckylab.com) bound to a non-standard 
port^H^H^H^H night.

Well, I just might have to make a field trip. I need to go into town, 
anyway. I tried to look them up on the web but ran into a 404 response 
to www.northwestbattery.com. Looking for them in Google with Konqueror 
was a bit frustrating. They're listed on a "yellow pages" site, but the 
page goes blank a fraction of a second after displaying something. I had 
enough time to see the northwestbattery.com web address, but nothing else.

I am using OpenVPN to connect from my internal systems to my outside
virtual server - I have been running my mail and other services up and
down this pipe for two years.  The connection is reliable.  I don't
know about Windows, beyond the fact that a Windows-client to *nix
server is available.  Since the VPN connection is bidirectional, I
would always use a secure Linux machine as the server end;  if I
needed to connect two Windows boxes, I would connect them through
a more secure Linux server.  Opening an inbound port on a Windows
machine scares the water out of me.

I had a little difficulty setting it up, but that was mostly because
I didn't RTFM completely.  I could show you how to set up a simple
linux-to-linux link.

I am preparing a presentation on "virtual servers, virtual networks"
that I expect to present at one of the PLUG meetings.  This is your 
opportunity to push me along.

When I went there the entry was already there. 

I sent him an e-mail suggesting that he speak at a PLUG meeting 
at Portland State. Assuming things work out, we need to get the 
word out quickly to the local Linux community. Also the PSU IT 
Department probably has an e-mail list it could be added to.

The OFFICIAL word is that he will let us know when "[his] travel 
arrangements are better understood".

Currently he is likely to be here sometime before Nov 30, but will try
to extend it past the 3rd.

No need to hound him, he will be here at some point in the near future ;-)

You don't need to open a port, though.  The beauty of OpenVPN's use of
UDP is that most stateful firewalls will see Windows-behind-the-firewall
trying to talk to VPS-out-in-the-internet and neither needs an actual
open-to-the-internet port.

My VPN server sits behind my firewall.  I'm not forwarding any ports to
it at all, and have linked up with networks set up similarly with it.
'tis quite interesting.

I worked off of examples a friend had set up.  He beat me to OpenVPN by
a month or two and has quite the network set up now.

Ah, that should be interesting.  I've been doing virtual servers and
virtual networks for a while now... and was recently recruited by a CS
prof to do an "Independant Study" project next term setting up a
many-networks-in-a-box that boots off CD.  I haven't investigated it too
much, but am planning on using UMLs to represent systems on the networks
and bridging to emulate switches the UMLs "plug in to".

I feel I should do something to help out. Were it not for the clinics I 
probably wouldn't even have Linux running yet. Although I am still terribly 
new to Linux, I'll do what I can, even if all I can offer is moral support. 

Perhaps more can be discussed at tomorrow's clinic.

Thanks. I translated the NE to SE without even thinking about it. My 
wife and I restored a Victorian house on 33rd at Belmont back in the 
1990-1994 time frame, so I'm familiar with the neighborhood.

I'll give them a call on Monday.

   I have problems with two hardware items and the response from each vendor
is underwhelming. I'm hoping to get suggestions from you folks on how to get
resolution.

   1.) Netgear VFS318 Firewall/Switch/Router/VPN gateway. This is a version-2
unit. It routes to/from the 'Net just fine, but the internal (host-to-host)
file transfer rate is 47KB/s maximum (on a 100MB/s Ethernet). When I plug the
hosts into a separate Linksys switch, and the switch into the Netgear, the
within-network transfer speeds jump up to 3-5MB/s. Ergo, there's a problem
with the Netgear.

   On 5 November I went to the Netgear web site, registered this unit, and
filed a support request. The unit is warranted for 5 years (according to
their web site). The web site also states that a response would be
forthcoming within 1-2 business days. Right.

   On 15 November I submitted a follow-up e-mail, then decided to give them a
call. A superficially-nice drone somewhere in the Indian sub-continent
confirmed that it had been 10 days with no response. He mumbled something
about the software not being under warranty (huh?), but that he would
escalate the request and someone would be in touch with me in 1-2 days. Sure.

   Here it is, four days later, and the silence from Netgear fills the office.
This unit cost me about $130 and I don't want to toss it, but it's not
working and I cannot get the company to make good on the warranty. Heck, I
cannot even initiate a conversation with their tech support people.

   I think that I'll try calling the President of Netgear on Monday. Anyone
have other ideas?

   2.)  Soyo KT600 Dragon Ultra Platinum Edition motherboard. Now 14 months
old. I bought it because it had good reviews on the Web, supported the Athlon
XP/3200+ processor, and came with $110 in rebates from Soyo. Rebates have
never been paid; that's a different issue.

   Last month, just after the 12-month warranty wore out, the system started
to hang. Locked up tighter than a drumhead. You'll recall a thread on this
issue on this mail list. I ran memtest86 and every test passed with flying
colors. This morning, I again tried to compile the 2.6.13.4 kernel and the
system screeched to a halt during the build of ../kernel/module.o.

   Last month I filed a request for support to Soyo's USA e-mail address. I
also wrote to the vendor. The silence from those two compete with the silence
from Netgear for my attention. What do you folks suggest?

   I'm thinking of ordering a replacement motherboard from Monarch Computing,
because they support AMD processors. If I can get a Soyo replacement, I'll
sell it or use it in a MythTV box for my fiancee.

   I've not had such bad service from hardware vendors before. I would like to
get these issues resolved but I'm out of fresh ideas.

My first guess is that one or more of your cards is having trouble 
with autonegotiation. You'll want to check the settings on both hosts:

$ sudo ethtool eth0

They should both report exactly the same duplex setting and, 
preferably, the same speed setting, e.g.,

   Speed: 100Mb/s
   Duplex: Full

If they don't, take a peek at the ethtool(8) man page to adjust things 
manually.

I've only place one order with Monarch, so caveat lector...

The hardware I got from Monarch has been rock-solid; I've no 
complaints now that it's up and running. My complaint is two-fold:

1. It took the better part of a month for my system to ship, and
    Monarch never notified me of delays.

2. The system didn't ship with all the RAM we purchased and it
    six separate phone calls -- all initiated by me -- to get
    this situation resolved to my satisfaction.

My initial impression is that you'll get really good parts, but speed 
of response to customer inquiries is definitely not up to my 
expectations (and you'll carry *all* the burden of follow-up if 
something goes awry with your order).

I have seen problems with some network components when one end of the 
wire couldn't autosense the speed.  The resulting confusion looked like 
the symptoms you are experiencing.  You might see if you can "hard wire" 
the line speed on both ends.

Paul,

   I did this. The slow speeds are also seen in transfers to/from my notebook.
All hosts report 100Mb/s and full duplex.

> I've only place one order with Monarch, so caveat lector...

   Well, according to their Web site, they stock only AMD 64 stuff now. I'll
call them on Monday as they're closed today.

   Gee, this looks just like what I'm dealing with now with Netgear, Soyo, and
Zip-zoom-fly-by-night. Do I need more aggrevation? No. Think I'll check with
Pacific Solutions.

Many thanks,

Rich

   You and Paul have raised valid points.

   On the host with the problematic motherboard, ethtool tells me there're no
data for eth0. That's strange. Running lspci reports both gigabit and tulip
(10/100 Mb/s) Ethernet connections.

   I suppose that I should learn why ethtool doesn't report anything. Of
course, if the motherboard is fragile, that would explain it, too.

Thanks,

Rich

ethtool doesn't work with everything.

I also want to thank Dan and Eric and Paul and everyone else who has 
helped make the clinic such a success for so many years.
I haven't attended many clinics has I try to spend weekends with my
family in Corvallis, but it has been great having the clinics.
They have helped so many people.

Yup, was discussed here a while ago.  I thought the conclusion was,
"it's bad, take it back to whoever you bought it from."
Did they say, "take it back to the manufacturer"?

[snipped: sadly typical manufacturer "support" experience.]

To save expensive call-center support time, they're trying to push off
support to email/web stuff, but for some reason, they're not actually
*providing* support that way, so all they do is ensure that their
customers are already pissed-off before they call.

But not to worry, the call-center folks are paid to follow the script
carefully and prevent you from using the precious time of the actual
support people, let alone incur the cost of a warranty exchange.

Also a sadly common breach of trust; since this one involves a written
promise and money, you might tell the state AG about it.

Sorry.  If you were dealing with a nice, reputable manufacturer, you
might have a chance, but then if you were, you'd have paid twice as
much anyway.

Support experiences like yours have trained me to *always* call first,
and find a way to badger the first-line phonedroid into transferring
me to support.

If they say a tech will call you back, it won't actually happen unless
you make a couple of follow-up calls.

Oh, and if the phonedroid has trouble understanding me, I hang up and
try again.  Unpleasant experience shows I'd end up hanging up anyway,
and it saves me the time, frustration and anger.

In sum: call early, call often, take no BS.

Oh, and buy local when possible.  Face-to-face support is *much* better.

OK, here's the deal. I've been in contact with him and the very  
tentative plan is for him to come in on the 30th and leave on the  
3rd. There is an assumption that I will take him down to Corvallis on  
Saturday. The problem is that he has bunches of meetings and doesn't  
know his schedule for sure.

Here's the most recent exchange (as of last night):

So, as SOON as I know when he is available, I'll be posting it here.  
At that time, let's collectively figure out the cool stuff for him to  
see/do while he is here. I didn't want to announce anything here  
until I know what was actually going to happen. Aaron just happens to  
be an excellent sleuth on this and so many other things.

There is one big issue for me personally, I have a gig on Thursday  
night, 1 Dec, that I had hoped to get out of. My wife made it very,  
very, very clear that I was not going to escape it, no matter what  
("But what if a Force 5 hurricane... NO, YOU ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING  
ELSE"). Sigh.

So, that means that Jeff will need a chaperone/chauffeur on Thursday  
night. Applicants contact me off line. Grand Tour scenic viewpoint  
suggestions wait until we know his schedule on Monday and then  
everyone can bog down the list server with demands for his time.

Peace, Love, and Happiness,

I have an embarrassingly stupid question for y'all.

I'm writing from my inlaws' in Klamath Falls. Before I left, I had set up my linux box at home with Poptop and the netgear box with forwarding the Poptop connection. I had imagined that I would be able to connect to my server at home from my windows laptop and browse the network (map a drive and all that rot). 

I know I misconfigured something, because I had to redo it with a differnet IP address, but it led me into kind of a difficult place to describe.

My routing out from the linux box at home was not working; I was on a different subnet from the netgear box (because I found that my inlaws were on the same subnet as my home subnet (192.168.0.0) and I was getting an error about 'loopback detected.' So I ssh'd in and changed the ip assignments for poptop, and I could connect.

But as soon as I did, my laptop lost its connection for ICQ and I could no longer browse the internet. Which implies to me that the laptop was sending _all_ of its internet traffic over the PPTP connection home, which is not what I wanted; I just wanted to connect like it was a network, and if I browsed for machines on a 192.168.0.x address (which I'll change to 192.168.something.else when I get home), the computer would be smart enough to send only that traffic over the vpn connection.

Reflecting on the nature of PoPToP and PPTP, I think I may have chosen the wrong vpn solution; Is there some sort of configuration thing that would help me with what I'm trying to do?

Thanks as always.
Russ (YAR!)

You probably need to tell the Windows PPTP connection not to send all
traffic over the VPN tunnel (the default).  It should be in the
advanced TCP/IP settings for the VPN connection.  Something like "use
default route for this connection" or some such.

So, to continue this very interesting and informative training session, 
i got out my (not so?) trusty Radio Shack V-A meter and tested some of 
my systems to see what kind of current they draw.  Here's the results:
1 - an old 233MHz Dell box:  never saw above 1 Ampere
2 - a pretty old 2 processor X 800 MHz HP workstation:  never saw above 
2 Amperes
3 - a home assembled 2GHz system: never saw above 1 Ampere
4 - a Sony 24" glass monitor (really heavy!!):  also under 1 Ampere even 
on startup

These numbers seem a bit light to me.  Any comments?  I used the meter 
and associated inductive pickup/multiplier on the 10X setting for better 
accuracy.

I wrote some instructions a while back on replacing a Windows VPN (PPTP) 
server with Linux:

http://poptop.sourceforge.net/dox/replacing-windows-pptp-with-linux-howto.phtml

This is probably the simplest way to implement a VPN, especially if you 
have a lot of Windows users.

   Dan asked me to write about PLUG on our Wikipedia page. However, I don't
know enough to do a credible job. If you write to me off the list with
information on the history of PLUG (when it was formed, by whom, and why),
what activities have been sponsored and/or promoted by the group, and so on,
I'll be happy to edit it all and put together information that we'd be
pleased to see on that web site.

   What's the major attraction of PLUG -- to you? What has it provided? I know
that several in the group were instrumental in initiating the Linux in
Education project, and we spoke of putting on a linux festival ... until we
learned that commercial companies were in the same market and would make us
look like the amateurs we were. What else?

   I recall mail list subscribers from Belgium, the Phillipines, eastern
Canada, central Texas (Austin), and Boulder, Colorado. It may be safe to
write that we are the oldest linux/UNIX users group west of the Cascade
Mountains in Oregon.

   Send me the material and I'll put it together. If you want illustrations to
accompany the text, send that along, too. Of course, all this will go over
the .sig of David Mandel as Penguin-in-Chief of the group.

I'll bet we're the only Linux/UNIX Group West of the Cascades.  Most all
LUGs are Linux User Groups... we're in a minority of Linux/UNIX Groups.

Looks OK to me.  You put the ammeter around only the black or the
white wire, right?

There's a PLUG FAQ somewhere. You should be able to get some good details
from there.

And here's one tidbit: The full name is "Portland Linux/Unix Group". It
was originally named "Portland Linux Users Group" but was later renamed
to make the Free/Open/NetBSD folks feel more welcome.

Message-ID: <20051120065142.GB20751@gate.kl-ic.com>


Still putting together a system for my wife's office.  Next comes
the printer - we need a black-and-white laser printer that occupies
the smallest possible space.  Most vendors call 10x15 inches a
"small footprint".  I would like to see a unit a lot smaller than
that, perhaps something portable,  or else a unit with a front output
that can fit in a stack on a shelf.   We bought an LCD display and
a Shuttle case purely because they are small - we don't want to
waste space in a tiny office with a printer.

Linux compatable of course, Postscript and Ethernet preferred.

Any ideas?

I've had pretty good success using a PPTP client under Linux to allow me to 
VPN into the office from my laptop. It made it easier to support a single VPN 
server in the office for both Windows and Linux users.

I made the measurements from the system power cords. My meter uses an 
inductive pickup/multiplier thingie that plugs into the wall outlet and 
the device to be measured then plugs into it. There is a "figure 8" 
looking gizmo attached to a power cord with the inner circle of the 8 
being 1x the current and the outer being 10x. The meter then clamps into 
either of these "circles". I had to use the 10x scale to get any 
readings since even on the 6A scale, the readings were so low. If these 
readings are in a realistic range, then my math says I need a 600VA (5A 
x 120V = 600 VA). Allowing for some headroom, I'm considering something 
along the lines of the Minuteman PRO1100iE. It has enough capacity that 
I should be able to plug in 3 or 4 systems, the monitor (I'm on a KVM), 
and network components. It also has the "MINUTEMAN SentryII?" software 
which supports Linux, Windoze and other OS's.

   Ouch! It hurts to pick that nit. Ain't semantics wonderful?

   Actually, I well remember the meeting at which this was discussed and the
broader name officially adopted (well, as official as anything in PLUG). It
still makes sense when you look at the posts here from folks running *BSD,
Solaris, even AIX (at least, in the past).

> Google says we're the most popular Linux/UNIX Group.

   I'm confident that's due to the number of inane posts from me, and the
sometimes really hot flames they've attracted. :-)

  I recently replaced the battery in my APC UPS.  I started having a

 Batteries Plus in Beaverton had the battery in stock.  I replaced the
battery, charged it overnight, and everything went back to normal.

Metro uses a Beowulf cluster to model land use and transportation

Transims, the software they're running is an interesting joint venture

If your inductive pickup loop encloses the entire cable (all three
conductors), then the net current in that bundle should be zero.  You
need to split the conductors out and enclose only one at a time.  I
recommend unplugging the cable before you start cutting though.

The inductive pickup gizmo is designed for and comes with the trusty 
Radio Shack V-A meter.  The "Inline Inductive Pickup.Multiplier" allows 
you to measure current when two or more wires are bonded together (power 
cord).  It also provides 10X readings for low current measurements.  So, 
I'm pretty sure that is not the problem.  I'm merely wondering if my 
observed readings are realistic.

I built myself one of these by wiring an outlet and the plug end of an 
extension cord into a handy box and having a loop of the hot wire stick 
outside the box.

HP (and maybe others) makes a printer with vertical input and outbout
bins on top.  Might have a 12"x10" footprint.  Low-volume, no
Postscript.  But in your position, I'd find a way to stick a fairly
thin printer (such as one of those inexpensive, Linux-compatible and
fast Samsung models) under the desk.  IMHO printers don't provide
enough useful interaction to deserve desk space.

I'm confused by this request. As the PLUG expert on Wikipedia (okay,
self-described; okay, I gave a presentation on it last summer), I have to
point out that there currently *is* a page about PLUG in Wikipedia. Dan
Haskel started it, & I kept it from getting deleted. (The short version
is that Dan was disgusted at how he was treated & left, while I argued
that there was no reason to delete the article & saved it; the long
version requires an in-depth understanding of Wikipedia politics & rival
philosophies, is admittedly boring, & no I won't explain it here.) And
from what I've seen over the last couple of years, more than a few
PLUGgers have participated in Wikipedia.

I just took a look at the article about PLUG on Wikipedia, & I didn't see
anything wrong with the article -- except that more could be written.
And anyone -- be they members of PLUG or not -- can add more information
just by clicking on the "edit" button/tab, type in what you want to add,
& after previewing your changes, click "save". It's actually quite simple
& you don't need a Ph.D. to do it; just a working connection to the
Internet.

So why exactly does this article need work? I'm not arguing the point: I
just want to know so I can help.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
After many months of being "off-line," the WyattERP libraries have returned
to open-source!

At http://wyatterp.com

you can find an open-source toolkit for building your own database-driven ERP
applications in a simple scripting language (Tcl/Tk). Typical applications
only require 100-1000 lines of front-end code for a fully-functional GUI
application. Also offered is a tool (Wyseman) for managing and upgrading your
database schema authoring files. These tools are probably overkill for most
single-user environments, but great for small to moderate enterprise
solutions. The toolkit comes with several sample applications to get you
started and there is a free mailing list (see sourceforge page) if you have
questions getting them running.

Commercial support, training courses and more sample applications may become
available if there is a demand.

While a prior release of the toolkit is in full and complete use in our own
enterprise (about 25 integrated applications for about 50 concurrent users),
this newly released version is "beta" grade. So your feedback in shaking out
the bugs would be greatly appreciated.

Happy downloads!

Subject: [PLUG] An Emacs Question
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0511210832180.28343@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'm editing two Python files. One is a stand-alone application with a
file length of 179 lines. The other is a module to be included in another
module, and it has a length of 205 lines.

   When I save the two files (one at a time, of course), the smaller one
returns instantly. But, the slightly longer one takes several seconds -- up
to about 10 -- before returning control to me.

   I've no idea why this happens; haven't seen such a lag before in any files
I've edited in emacs. Might someone here have an explanation or thoughts on
why one file might be so slow to save? They're both in the same directory.

Thanks,

Rich

Hi Rich,

Are both files being edited in the same emacs mode? Are the permissions on
both files the same? Perhaps for some reason one of the files is causing
some lisp macro to run when the file gets saved.

   Yes. Both are 644.

   This could be, I suppose. But, there's no indication of what's happening.
Any way to test this hypothesis?

Jim,

   I figured out the problem and fixed it. I think. Another file had been
editied by someone running on a Microsoft system so it had DOS cr/lf instead
of lf as a newline. Running that file through dos2unix seems to have sped up
all file saves within emacs.

   Heh, heh, heh! Over the years I've sent e-mail messages there and left a
couple of voice mail messages. No one has ever responded. I get tremendous
support from the German TeX group, particularly those in Berlin; they're all
active in the LyX mail list, the PSTricks mail list, the beamer-class mail
list. I've never seen anyone identified with TUG on any of those mail lists.

   Heck, last year when we tried to get a LaTeX group going from the PLUG
members only Ed Sawicki, Geoff Burling, and I showed up for meetings. Feh!

Message-ID: <20051121231551.71129.qmail@web50614.mail.yahoo.com>

I thought that getting an IP Web cam might be a neat
way to avoid the compatibility problem, but I was only
partially correct. It is set up in Windows and can be
accessed by any OS after that, using its IP address. 

Although it is supposed to work with Linux, the
browser specified for Windows is MSIE with Active-X
controls enabled. When the program is invoked in the
Web browser with MSIE, one has the option of recording
the output from the Webcam. This option, however, is
apparently not available in Linux. Does anyone know of
Linux-based software that supports this capability for
IP Web cams?

You could see if the software is just disabling the feature when it
sees you're not using IE.  Try changing your user-agent string with a
plugin, there are some for firefox and mozilla (probably everything
for that matter).

   I've a Python beginner's question on referencing a separate module from the
module that holds the application invocation code. I'd appreciate having a
clue stick passed my way.

   Here's the pertinent line in eikos.py:

class Eikos(wx.App):
   def OnInit(self):
     wx.InitAllImageHandlers()
     self.main = mainFrame(None)

   And here's the error message:

   File "eikos.py", line 14, in OnInit
     self.main = mainFrame(None)
NameError: global name 'mainFrame' is not defined

   Finally, this is start of the module file that I'm trying to call in that
line:

#Frame:eikosFrame

import wx
import DlgHelp, modModel, modPolicy

class mainFrame(wx.Frame):
   def __init__(self, parent, ID, title):
     wx.Frame.__init__(self, None, id=wxID_FRAME, title='Eikos', pos=wx.Point(349, 199),
     size=wx.Size(853, 616), style=wx.DEFAULT_FRAME_STYLE)

   I've changed the class name in both files, but it makes no difference. I
know it's very, very elementary, but I'm just not seeing it now.

Does eikos.py import the module?

I think you want to either call it as:
import <yourmodule>
...
self.main = <yourmodule>.mainFrame(None)

or

import * from <yourmodule>
...
self.main = mainFrame(None)

That's "from <yourmodule> import *"  Replace * with specific class or 
function names if you desire to be that explicit.

Yeah.  Python has several ways for you to import things into your 
namespace, but you do have to have some kind of import statement for 
almost anything.

How did you manage to get your program to exit without:

  import sys
  sys.exit(0)

?

written in python hung until you read far enough to learn that :-)

Eric,

   This resolves that problem, but I'm still left with too few arguments ... I
think in the call to the eikosFrame.py module.

   Thank you, Eric and Dan. Issue resolved by adding the missing arguments in
the calling module.

Yup.  I recently played shepherd for a bunch of HP DL360s with dual 15k
RPM drives, dual 2.6GHz Xeon procs, lots of memory on metered APC PDUs
(power distribution units; think high-end powerstrip) and rarely saw a
draw of more than 6A with all 8 sockets in use (some of them were
plugged in but used by the secondary power supplies, which I was told
didn't draw if the primary was operational).

If my interpret my observations correctly, these high-power-draw servers
were only actually drawing about 100-150W.  If I'm wrong, I trust
someone who knows this stuff will disabuse me of these mistakes
(Galen?).

People seem to think that that 350W or 400W rating on the computer's
power supply indicates that it draws that continuously, like a
lightbulb.  That is not the case AFAICT, which is why UPSen are rated in
Volt-Amps instead of Watts--they are in fact the same, but VA is a
little consensual lie that makes you think about the actual draw, as
opposed to a power supply's rating.

I've been thinking about getting one of these, because I'm very curious
about this kind of thing: http://tinyurl.com/czjkx

NOT the same


The measurement of electrical power that is computed by multiplying
volts times amps. In a DC circuit, volt-amps (VA) and watts are the same
because DC circuits do not add inductance and capacitance that take away
power. In AC devices, volt-amps ratings are higher than watts. For
example, in an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), the volt-amps rating
is approximately 60% higher than the actual wattage.



When a sinusoidal voltage is applied to a purely resistive load (an
electric heater) the current has exactly the same waveform and phase.
We use "rms" to indicate the magnitude of a sine wave voltage or current
because a sinewave of 120 volts rms produces the same amount of heat in
a resistor as a steady dc 120 volts.  A 120 volt rms sine wave has peak
values, plus and minus, of square root of two times 120, or plus and minus
170 volts.

For a purely resistive load, the power dissipated, in watts, is simply
volts rms times amps rms (watts == volt-amps).  Because then is no phase in DC.

If the load contains inductors (eg most motors or transformers), or 
capacitors, the current either lags behind or leads the voltage.  
Voltage and current are out of phase.  
When the voltage reaches its peak the current is not at its peak.  
If the difference in time between voltage peak and
current peak is given as an angle, theta (one complete cycle = 360 
degrees), then the power is volts rms times amps rms times cosine(theta).
Volt-amps is greater than watts.

When the alternating current supply is rectified to obtain the direct
current needed by most electronics, the current waveform may be far from
sinusoidal, for example "square-wave"-like or a series of impulses.
Here the power must be determined by calculating the product of the 
instantaneous voltage and current, and integrating the product over a full
cycle.   Watts will generally not be equal to volts times amps.

So, in sizing a UPS, make sure that the total load requires fewer watts,
AND fewer volt-amps than the rating of the UPS.  Unfortunately, most
devices do not have labels indicating both watts and volt-amps, so we
just have to guess, and use a somewhat larger UPS.

This is a good assumption...  The speed-o-meter on your car goes to 120
MPH...  How often do you go 120 MPH <OK.  Don't tell me.. I don't want
to know>


Then power supply manufacturer is assuming the user will draw at most
50% normal load....

Which means if you have a 400 Watt power supply  the PS vendor is
counting on you using only 200 Watts normally...

The PS is not designed to put out 400 Watts continuously.  
It can the life goes down rapidly!!!

Vram's explanation sounded good to me.  I'm really more of a digital
guy :-)   That said, I think your 100-150W number is reasonable.  Most
power supplies are rarely run at anything near their rated capacity.
The extra headroom is a good idea though.  Modern processors can go from
idle (<5W) to full tilt (> 50W) pretty much instantaneously.  System
power up can also tax the supply, particularly if drive spinup isn't
staggered.

Rob, Keith, Matt, Tony, Bill and Paul:
Thanks very much for taking the time to respond to my information quest.
You've given me some great starting points for some labs to check this out.

Here's another quest for opinions: Is it reasonable to run the VPN server
and squid guard server on the same box functioning as a NAT router/firewall?

I'm looking for a "VPN server" for my work situation. Here's my wish list:
 Prefer open source solution.
Connect to and from both Linux and Windows computers.
Easy to use by end users.
 This means minimal set up issues by Windows end users trying to connect
from home to work.
Works through most peoples "firewall/routers" at home.
Authentication against Windows active directory would be great.
 I could live with a commercial appliance, but don't want to pay extra per
client.
I've seen some canned (netgear) "firewall/routers" that have built in VPN
but they appear to be optimized for a client that you have to pay a license
fee for every client machine.
 While open vpn (http://openvpn.net) doesn't seem to meet all the list
above, it looks interesting. Any body have any experience with it? Any other
products/projects come to mind?
 Thanks in advance for your help

I went to use a Ubuntu Live-CD (5.10) that I burned recently and
discovered that a band of sectors on it were bad.  Trying to burn new
ones resulted in the sectors being bad.  I've burned on three
different burners, one brand new, on two different machines, all
recent linux kernels (2.6.13.2 and 2.6.14), two different brands of
media, and get identical failures.  The burning, executed as follows:

  # cdrecord -v -eject dev=/dev/hdc /src_archive/ubuntu-5.10-live-i386.iso

I also tried setting a lower speed:

  # cdrecord -v -eject speed=16 dev=/dev/hdc /src_archive/ubuntu-5.10-live-i386.iso

all goes without apparent problem.  If I immediately push the cdr back
in (or do so later) and run:

  # md5sum /dev/hdc

after a while I get errors like the following in /var/log/messages:

It is notable that the range of sectors involved is identical in all

Double duh.  I had puzzled over this very problem with Galen back in
April and had read the solution.  You learn something old every day!

I must say though, Ubuntu did get confused running off of the unpadded
CDR.  Not sure yet whether it was related or not.

I really like this discussion - it's very educational.  

An ex-employee of mine who is still at HP has been doing some research 
on this for the past few years.  He sent me his spreadsheet showing the 
power draw of about 30 HP systems and monitors.  This info made me much 
more comfortable about my readings - they're right in line with his 
observations.  NOW - all's I have to do is find a smart,1.5 KVA UPS with 
Linux and Windoze support for not very much money.  Should be easy :-)

Message-ID: <20051122192553.GA30877@gate.kl-ic.com>


This is more a computer science question than a Linux question, but 
there are probably folks in PLUG that can answer it.

I am working on an integer arithmetic problem that can be accelerated
with table lookups; for example, a randomly accessable 256Kbyte table
accelerates the computation by about 25 times.  Much larger tables make
the calculation somewhat faster, roughly proportional to the logarithm
of the table size.  I can make the table larger or smaller, impacting
compute time somewhat, but (I assume) impacting swap time and cache
misses significantly.  Overall program size is small, I/O is very
small, and the calculation is quite amenable to parallelization.  
It is not code-breaking, but it is that kind of intense arithmetic.

The calculation will run for a very long time on a lightly loaded
Linux machine with a P4 and a 512K cache.  I will probably use GCC
and a recent 2.6.X kernel, though I am told the Intel compiler might
give better results (debatable;  a separate question).

So the question:  what percentage of cache size should I target
my application and table to run in?  That is, how big can a chunk
of code and data get before performance starts to degrade?

Hello, OSCON attendees!

By now you should all be recovered from the OSCON hangovers (and EuroOSCON
hangovers if you made the trip with us to Amsterdam) and working with all the
cool tools you learned about at those conferences. I've already begun
planning next year's OSCON, and I'm glad to announce that your feedback was
overwhelmingly in support of returning to the Oregon Convention Center, so
that's what we're going to do.

OSCON 2006 will be at the Oregon Convention Center, July 24-28. Save the
date! I'm already scouting projects and people who should be there, and a CFP
will hit the airwaves soon. In the meantime, if you can think of something I
should be planning to have, let me know: <oscon-idea at oreilly.com>. Until
then, if you want to relive the love that was OSCON 2005, you can do so via
the conference coverage <http://www.oreillynet.com/oscon2005/>, presentation
files <http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/38/presentations.html>, and IT
Conversations recordings <http://www.itconversations.com/series/oscon2005.html>.

When I'm not working on next year's OSCON, I'm working on the Emerging
Telephony conference <http://conferences.oreilly.com/etel>. I'm co-chair of
that, so naturally we're going to feature open source VoIP systems heavily.
If you need to know how to build the killer next-generation voice
applications on open standards, open source, and open platforms, have I got a
conference for you! No really, literally I do. And if you register with the
discount code ETel06AL20 you'll get 20% off the registration cost. Get in
before December 5, 2005 and you'll get the additional early discount of $300
as well.

Looking forward to hearing from you and seeing you at OSCON and/or ETel in
2006,

Nat Torkington
OSCON Program Chair

Not the educated/informed statement you are looking for, but probably
the best way to tell is to try.

Hello--

I wanted to pass along the following news:

Daniel Steinberg has been working on podcasting for O'Reilly and he
called to let me know about two ways in which user group members might
want to get involved. First, if you have your own podcast, let us know
about it and we will link to it and feature your shows from time to time
on our podcasting home page (http://www.oreillynet.com/podcasts). Also,
if you have an interesting speaker coming up, you might want to do an
interview and submit it for inclusion in our magazine show "Distributing
the Future" (http://www.oreillynet.com/future). In any case, if you have
interesting ideas for how you might want to contribute to O'Reilly
podcasting, send Daniel an email at daniel at oreilly.com.

Thanks for your help,

I doubt you'll be able to avoid cache misses*, but you can avoid
swapping by just counting your free memory at runtime and subtracting
your program's dynamic needs (including storage for output data.)

FWIW, your table could at least be a multiple of getpagesize() bytes
(4096 on my system).

* Eventually isn't it likely that even local (stack) variables will
end up in cache, and cause portions of your table to be relegated bace
to standard memory? Presumeably you won't be accessing every value in
the table more than anything else.. or will you?

If all that is wanted is to prevent the lookup table from getting swapped
to disk, just lock it in to memory with mlock(). See the man page for
mlock(2).

The problem course is that only root can do mlock(), so the process
would have to start out as root. After doing the mlock() the program
could setuid() to a non-root user for subsequent processing.

It's the Final Appearance of the Badger Badger Badger Tour! Jeff  
Waugh will be travelling for a month and a half, criss-crossing the  
northern hemisphere, to bring the world of Ubuntu to your doorstep.  
Expect badgers, mushrooms, schnaaaaaakes, an awful lot of Ubuntu CDs,  
and a healthy dose of madcap hijinks.

You can read about the tour here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ 
BadgerBadgerBadgerTour

Who:	Jeff Waugh of Ubuntu fame
When:	Tuesday 11/29 7:30pm
Where:	THAT'S A PROBLEM!

I booked Free Geek for that night, but it is probably too small for  
the number of people who will show up. Is there anyone out there with  
access to a nice room that is centrally located and that can hold  
~200 people?

We can do it at Free Geek, but its going to be *really* crowded if we  
do. If you have any suggestions, please email/call me ASAP.

Here's some info on Jeff (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JeffWaugh)

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't "which pages are in the CPU cache" 
determined by the kernel based on access frequency?  (and maybe some 
other interesting parameters)

If so, it would probably be a good idea to just use a (custom-ordered by 
frequency of use?) hash with buckets based on the pagesize (seems like 
there should be a lib for that.)  Yeah, you'll end up in main memory 
with some of the buckets, but if that performance hit is worse than 
just recalculating from nothing, then I have to doubt whether caching 
will actually give you real-world performance gains.

Wow, are you actually expecting 200 people to show up?  That seems like
an awefully large number...

Are people outside of Ubuntu circles familiar with Jeff Waugh at all?
I'd never heard of the guy until y'all mentioned him here... and I've
been around for a while (admittedly not nearly as long as some in here).

Well, he is well known in the Ubuntu community and he spoke at OSCON  
and he's a primary person on the GNOME project, plus a bunch of other  
stuff. Also I hear that he is VERY funny (and his emails seem to  
verify that).

So, I have a room tentatively booked at PSU, the Vanport Room #338 in  
Smith Memorial Center. I won't know for sure until morning, so as  
soon as I hear I'll put out the word.

And that's the number he said to expect - apparently he's been  
getting that in a lot of spots on the tour. We'll see.

Jeff Waugh will be travelling for a month and a half, criss-crossing  
the northern hemisphere, to bring the world of Ubuntu to your  
doorstep. Expect badgers, mushrooms, schnaaaaaakes, an awful lot of  
Ubuntu CDs, and a healthy dose of madcap hijinks.

So who the heck is Jeff Waugh?

Here's some info on Jeff (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JeffWaugh)

So if you are interested in Ubuntu Linux, GNOME, the role of Free/

or badgers, come on down.

   Some time this holiday weekend I'm going to replace the failing Soyo
motherboard with a MSI board. I'd like to freshen the CPU heat sink thermal
compound while I'm at it, but I have none here.

   Is there anyone in the relative area of Troutdale/Gresham that has a bit I
can use?

Thanks, and a happy Thanksgiving to you all,

If I'm not too late to save you from MSI, I'll strongly suggest looking 
for something else.  I just can't hate them enough.

Mayonnaise?  What are thinking?  It will break down in the heat.  You
gotta use KY Jelly, it won't break down with heat. :)

Rich,

I picked up some at the Sandy, OR Radio Shack in the not too distant past.  It 
cost me a whole $1.99.  If you can't find any, I have some here in Sandy (not 
too far from Gresham/Troutdale).
E-mail me if you need some.

Eric,

   I have one in my main workstation/server that has run flawlessly for more
than two years now. The Soyo board had mostly positive reviews on Google, but
started to fail just after the warranty ran out and the company has not
responded to my e-mails over the past two weeks.

   The Socket-A boards are difficult to find now (after all, they are about
two years old), and the MSI is the only one I found in Portland. I could have
bid on a Soyo board on eBay, but my experience with that company has been
less than positive, so why should I get another that may also fail in 13
months?

Thanks for your thoughts,

Rich

Yesterday's Oregonian had a flyer from Office Depot. One of their 
coupons offered ink and toner for 50% off. While the words "Office 
Depot" are on the coupon, it is not clear from the way it's printed that 
the only products covered by the offer are Office Depot BRAND toner and 
ink. We learned this after waiting in line at the checkout counter. 
Fortunately, we were able to spot a new register opening that saved us 
another 20 minutes, but still, it was a waste of time to make the trip.

This was at about 6:30 this morning. When we entered the store, there 
were three lines with between 30 and 50 people in each line. Might have 
had something to do with the offer in the same flyer for an HP Presario 
laptop for about $350.

That's really what I meant when I said recursive chown.  I'm just wondering
if the numeric uid/gid is hiding in any other files.

In general users can only own files in 

/home/user
/tmp/user

   Don't forget to grpunconv before making the changes and grpconv afterwards.

Ah, _in_ other files... not that I know of.  Maybe /etc/fstab if you
are mounting things for a particular user, but that seems unlikely.

I'm converting my own account, and I'm anything but a normal user.  For

I've looked at /etc/gshadow and the numeric gid is not present, so I don't
think this should be necessary.  Correct me if I'm wrong.

Convenience mostly.  I can do a make install into /usr/local without 
switching to root.  I'm also tight on disk space in /home, but /usr/local
has free space.

galen,

   I cannot say. But, I recall from a long time ago that it is prudent to
unconvert the /etc/passwd file before modifying existing entries, and to
reconvert it when done. I've just done this when I've had to futz with the
file.

  "I must have put premium in this baby by mistake... it hates expensive gas!"

I've been working on a customized Knoppix CD again recently.  Since
the last time I did this, I upgraded the RAM in the box I am doing the
mastering on.  I noticed some weird instabilities, like getting cloop
errors reading blocks, and then swaths of applications not working
anymore.  Very strange.  I've done memtest86+ runs and they look
okay.  Usually I can get it to flip out by doing a "dd if=/dev/hdc
of=/dev/null bs=2048", opening/closing firefox a few times, etc.  I
just restarted with the "mem=1024M" boot option and things seem
better.  I've thrashed it around some and nothing strange has happened
yet.

BTW, I had been planning on trying Ubuntu's liveCD instead, because of
some weirdness with usb-storage handling in Knoppix, but Ubuntu, it
seems, has no practical way of fixing up video parameters.  It
insisted on running X at 640x480 despite ddcprobe clearly reporting
the correct (and much more capable) sync ranges for my monitor.  The
usb-storage handling is somewhat more sane on Ubuntu, but it didn't
seem like the tradeoff was worth it (all the configuration questions
at the front end was a bit tedious too).

First of all, which version of Knoppix is this? If the kernel config 
file is on there, make sure it's configured for the size of RAM you have.

Dead wrong. At a minimum add /var/mail and /var/tmp. Fairly often there
is /usr/tmp and /usr/local/tmp (fairly often linked to another tmp and
rarely used, but folks can create files there). In the general case using
`find` is highly recommended in order to guarentee you capture any extra
files.

Because it is handy. Things directly under /usr are generally considered
more secure than /usr/local. As /usr/local tends to be left out of $PATH
for SUID programs, the hazard from allowing it is not too large (doesn't
mean I do so though).

Message-ID: <4387F514.2050501@mpcu.com>

When I issue a " grep 8119 .bash_history ", grep returns " Binary file

grepping a binary file,  but .bash_history certainly not one.  Applying

Subject: [PLUG] How to get rid of blank ghost items in KDE 3.4 menu?
Message-ID: <200511252151.57369.alex@daniloff.com>

Hello Linux folkz,
Once I had an installation of early version of CrossOver office.
It was awfully buggy and I deinstalled it.
However, it left after itself blank CrossOver folder with blank items in KDE 
3.4 menu. I deleted them via KDE Menu Editor and got into more troubles.
After installation of a new version of CrossOver office, its menu and items 
didn't show up in KDE Menu at all. 
After I deleted config file ~/.config/menus/applications-kmenuedit.menu
The new CrossOver folder reappeared in KDE menu but those old CrossOver ghost 
menu items were mixed with the menu items of the new one. 
Could somebody please give me a clue, where KDE 3.4 keeps its global menu 
configuration file. I would like to edit it directly to get rid of those 
ghost menu items for good.

Thank you in advance for any help.

Alex

I think there's something we do that breaks .bash_history ...I've had
identical issues before.  I don't recall how I fixed it, though....

".bash_history", assuming you are currently logged on, is an open file 
and its buffers may not have been flushed. If you are interested in 
something in you history, use the bash "history" built-in. I believe if 
you are *not* logged in, you can grep in .bash_history and everything 
works just fine.

I think that is wrong.  

The ~/.bash_history file is opened, read and closed when bash starts
up, then is opened, written to and closed when bash is exiting.  It
isn't open while running.  I know that's the case with zsh (because I
hacked on its history facility *looong* ago[1]), and it appears to be
the case for bash as well, judging by its apparent behavior when I
checked just now.  One could confirm that with strace.

[1] I am even mentioned in /usr/share/doc/zsh/CONTRIBUTORS.gz

$ man grep

and look for "binary".

Searching from the top, the first one is:

       -a, --text
              Process  a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to
              the --binary-files=text option.


The next "hit" is this, which I think explains what you are seeing:

       --binary-files=TYPE
              If the first few bytes of a file indicate that the file contains
              binary data, assume that the file is of type TYPE.  By  default,
              TYPE is binary, and grep normally outputs either a one-line mes-
              sage saying that a binary file matches, or no message  if  there
              is  no  match. [...]

I'd recommend taking a look at the top of .bash_history to see if
there are any accented characters that aren't strictly ASCII.

Right.. After I posted that I did a find .... And of course I have
mail... So  I have files over there...

But, when he changes /etc/passwd and /etc/group  those files will
follow the change..  This creates dead files but, that is a different

I don't have a /usr/tmp or /usr/local/tmp soo.......

I agree use find...

I still stand by my original statement...

I finally got out to NW Battery yesterday. I charged up the new battery

yes, they did recycle my old battery for me.

Thanks to all for the recommendations.

I think even ~/.config is not kde-specific (I seem to recall something 
about freedesktop.org working on standardizing this stuff?)

Try kde-config.  On my system 'kde-config --path xdgconf-menu' 
shows /etc/xdg/menu.  You might want to check other types though 
(kde-config --types) to see what types are defined.

I imagine that getting the configs into the xml format is largely 
distro-dependent.

Subject: [PLUG] Netgear Closes Support Request Without Response
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0511261303190.17275@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Back on November 5 I entered an on-line request for technical support for my
Netgear VFS318's lack of intranet transfer speed. On November 15th I not only
added a second request for help to the open case file, but I called their
India support and actually spoke with a person. That person promised to have
someone contact me within 1-2 business days.

   Now I get a request from that company to give them feedback on their
support service. But, no one ever replied to my request for help and they've
closed the case! Two requests from me for warranty help, no response from the
company, and they just mark the case as completed and closed. I'm more than
majorly annoyed and put off by this.

   Monday I will try to contact someone, probably David Soares (Sr. VP of
Worldwide Sales and Support) in Santa Clara. If they won't help me, I toss
this trash away and try to find a firewall appliance that will actually work.
This is the second VFS318 in succession that has failed.

   Anyone have suggestions for an affordable, quality solution?

This is where you've got the problem. A malicious user might of made
SUID/SGID programs, which if you miss them give the user a trapdoor back
to his/her old UID/GID. Not something that will happen often, but these
left behind files can be quite dangerous.

It has a crucial implication wrong. In general users *will* own files in
those directories, this does not mean those will be the only places where
a user-owned files /can/ be. /Often/ those will be the only places where
users have files, but this isn't even close to be universal. The most
common divergence is various programs may sprinkle user-owned files all
over /var.

Oh, one more thing. Depending on setup, users are likely to have files
directly in /tmp.

Keith,

   These look like wireles access points. I'm looking for an internal network
switch and firewall that sits between the DSL bridge and the internal
network. The Netgear is small, silent, and has all the necessary functions.
Unfortunately, the maximum host-to-host transfer rates are only 47Kb/sec on a
fast Ethernet network.

I call them routers but they do support differing devices, wireless
being just one.

The routerboard 500 has what appears to be 3 ethernet interfaces and
slots for mini-pci cards. 

Maybe another alternative would be the linksys wrt54g with an alternate
firmware loaded such as OpenWRT.

I have a friend who got himself a WRT54GS and loaded OpenWRT on it.
He's been quite happy with the thing.

Note: The latest revision of the WRT54G does *not* support the loading
of Linux.

    I have a LinkSys Wireless-G access point we use for one portable. I greatly
appreciate your ideas.

    My expectation is that I'll get Netgear to do something by speaking with
someone in the executive suite (or cubicle row). Companies like that don't
like negative word-of-mouth advertising. I'm quite bothered by their
arrogance in not responding, closing the ticket, then asking me to rate the
service ... the non-existent service. I also don't like to throw away $130.

For what it's worth, on the Netgear FVS318...

I think I saw a reference in one of the previous threads on this subject
that this was about version 2 hardware of the FVS318.

At one time, I tried what I guess was version 1.  (There was no hardware
version number on the box).  For me, it never worked.  ALL tries to make
it work had exactly the same symptoms.  As soon as significant traffic
flowed over a connection, that connection hung.  An example of a
"significant" amount of traffic is the output of a "ps -ef" command over a
ssh connection.  Lesser, slower traffic was fine; like typing "date".

Exactly this behavior persisted through 3-4 firmware releases.  Looking at
different net forums, there was some talk about getting around hung or
dropped connections by changing maximum frame sizes.  That didn't help
me.  And by this time it was too late to return it.

I ended up with the Linksys/Cisco RV082 8 port vpn router.  The advertised
capabilities were roughly equivalent to the  FVS318; at 2-3x the price. 
However, for me, the RV082 worked fine.

I've still got the old FVS318; I'll probably try to recycle it through 
freegeek
at some time in the future.

PHILOSOPHY:

Cheap, fast, good, pick, er, one?

The metaproblem here is that you attempted to get a zillion features
in one box and you did not succeed.  Had the Netgear box succeeded
for you, you would have still been faced with future re-configuration
problems, the inability to adapt to new protocols, and probably a
windows-driven upgrade path.  So sooner or later, the VFS family would
break your heart.  It's actually a good thing that you got burned
right away, before you invested too much of your own spirit in it.

When a low-budget, culturally-different company like Netgear trolls
for sales bullet points by packing functionality into a big EPROM,
there is an awfully good chance that some of that functionality
will play badly with other functionality, or will be merely hard to
explain to a small businessman in Oregon.   Such oversized code wads
are often patched at ship time with a Windoze CDROM that does a
firmware or runtime patch on the software or the config.  Or the
firmware stays broken, with successful configuration possible only
using a Windows GUI. 

Or complete success is impossible under some circumstances.  Your
configuration was probably never considered or tested in Bangalore
or Shanghai or Taipai where your VFS was designed.  With two units
failing the same way, chances are your packets and connections and
setup do not match anything they ever tested, and some exception
condition is failing the fast path through hardware/firmware and is
falling down into some slow error-handling path, perhaps getting 
logged very slowly to the EPROM.  With closed source hardware and
firmware, you will never know, and without extensive testing, you
will not even be able to characterize the failure.  Call the VP of
anything at Netgear, and nobody will be able to tell you what is
going on or what fixes it - they haven't done enough engineering and
testing.  And enough people seem to like the VFS as-is that Netgear
has no need to make you happy.  I hope you can get a refund, but
chances are you are completely expendable to them.

Even if you paid big bux to a high-reputation outfit like Cisco
for the same functions, there will be some problems.  And you will
still end up speaking to some phone pool in Mumbai.  And you probably
wouldn't get an immediate fix, though I would expect Cisco to initiate
remediating engineering projects based on fewer complaints - at those
prices and with those expectations they must be more anticipatory. 
That still doesn't do much good for your problem right now.

As a hardware designer, it pains me to say this, but firmware and
hardware solutions are usually inferior to open-source software
solutions.  Everyone makes mistakes - software mistakes can usually
be fixed in the field.  Try to find an open software solution; 
either obsolete laptop based (nice low-power X86 Linux platforms)
or firmware solutions that support Linux in some way (WRT54G's or
Soekris for example).

SOLUTION:

At the risk of wasting space and burning electricity on multiple
boxes when theoretically you could get by with only one, you probably
want to break the function up.  A cheap internal multiport switch. 
A cheap external switch if needed.  An old laptop running Linux for
your firewall.  Reduced expectations about stateful routing inside
your secure zone.  That is my setup, and while configuring the Linux
laptop is a small annoyance, it does mean I am able to upgrade and
add new features, and work in a familiar environment.

Sorry I can't provide a more pleasing answer.

   Actually, Keith. What I wanted was -- still is -- an effective firewall in
a small, low-power, silent case. The internal switching and connection to the
DSL bridge were bonuses. Also, the experience of PLUGgers using the same
model gave me confidence that this solution would work.

> With two units failing the same way, ...

   They didn't. The first one worked great as an internal network switch but
was deaf, dumb, and blind to the outside world. Could not connect to the 'Net
through the Fujitsu DSL bridge. This second one connects externally just
fine, is doing a highly effective job as a firewall, but crawls through
solidified treacle pushing bits around the internal network.

   My interim solution is to keep the printers and wireless router connected
to the Netgear, and connecting a LinkSys 4-port switch between that and the
wired hosts. It's ugly, and I no longer get firewall reports from the
Netgear, but it works.

   I'm rather cramped for room, but I could put a very small box on the desk
and set it up as a firewall. I suppose that my old Toshiba Portege would do
the job if it keeps running with the cover closed and an 8-port switch and
the Fujitsu sitting on it. But, I'd also need another NIC ... a 16-bit pcmcia
card one. Seems rather inelegant and patched together, however. On the other
hand, I bought the OpenBSD book thinking that would be a very good OS for a
firewall.

   You're right about the quality of Netgear and their indifference to any one
of us as an individual customer. Since my baling wire-and-chewing-gum setup
works for now, I want to take my time and get a better solution installed.
You and the others who've contributed to this thread all have excellent
recommendations. Right now, I have two business priorities that take
precedence, but I will investigate options and I certainly appreciate that
each of you who is much more experienced than I with hardware, firmware, and
software share your knowledge and insight with me.

Sorry to hear about your Netgear FVS318 problems. I know I have version 1 of 
that hardware and so do a number of other people I know when we were all 
working for the same company and used them for VPN access between home and 
the office. At some point I'd like to replace mine with an OpenBSD firewall 
solution which was something I had for a number of years.  Sometime ago I  
got a USB network adapter for my printer and so I was able to do away with my 
OpenBSD firewall box. My firewall was an 8 year old PC/AT system which 
besides being a firewall was my home's Samba and print server as well.

I really like having a firewall that has no moving parts and I'm considering 
the purchase of a net4801 board from Soekris Engineering which combined with 
a small OpenBSD install could provide me a quiet OpenBSD-based firewall.

http://www.soekris.com/index.htm

I know it will be a bit of work setting up a router like that set up but it 
will be a good learning experience and it will be nice to have a more 
configurable firewall using "pf" over what basic support the Netgear box 
supports. The downside will be that I'll have to use a switch along with the 
Soekris box since it doesn't provide an 8-port switch like the FVS318 
provides.

Tony,

   The external connection works just fine on the FVS318, so I can see how its
use as a VPN would be excellent. It's the internal packet moving that fails.

   Keith pointed me there this morning. By adding their additional 4-port PCI
card there are a total of seven ports, and that's just enough for me. I'm
going to save my pennies for the package of the 4801, case, 4-port PCI card,
and power supply. I just bought a replacement 2.5" hard drive (60G) to
replace the 6G drive in the Toshiba Portege. I could use the 6G drive on the
Soekris; that's plenty of room for an installation and firewall rules.

   I'd like to put either OpenBSD on there for the firewall functions or
Slackware. Perhaps we might both have the budget for the Soekris about the
same time and can share the pain of putting OpenBSD on it and properly configuring
it.

Why not just buy a nice solid Netgear FS108 or FS105 and plug that
into your 318 (if the external connection is working for you)?

I mean, if you want to save yourself the hacking time it'll take to
build your soekris device.  Not that it wouldn't be interesting, but
it isn't going to be a 15-minute job either.

Subject: [PLUG] Open Document Standards
Message-ID: <1133190902.32524.53.camel@localhost>

Gentlemen:

As are likely aware, the State of Massachusetts is moving toward an Open
Document standard for the State's computerized documents.
Massachusetts's IT director, Peter Quin, cited long term data retention
and a move away from single vendor dependence as primary reasons for the
approved initiative.

Oregon agencies and businesses are facing the same issues retrieving
their data in proprietary formats that Massachusetts is facing;
difficulty retrieving documents written with older, proprietary
software. The problem is aggregated as the proprietary software that
originally wrote the document uses a non-disclosed format written in
binary. 

The Open Document format, approved by the State of Massachusettes and
international standards consortiums, relieves the problem by providing
an open and clearly documented standard. In effect, ODF documents are
written using a structure that is clearly documented and free of
copyright restrictions. A key benefit is that ODF documents may still be
retrieved even if the vendor of the document software is unwilling or
unable to provide a system of retrieving the information in a way that
is compatible with new systems.

It is critical that Oregon move to an open documentation standard.
During my 15 years in the Information Technology industry in both
technical and managerial capacities, I have seen time and time again the
consequences of implementing IT models using undocumented, proprietary
systems.

I look forward to discussing the matter with each of you further. Please
contact me for a meeting at your convenience You may find my

I have an antenna that connects to my Linux client's wireless

I want to move the client into another room, but I can't 
move the antenna.  So, I figure, replace the computer 
with a little wireless transmitter/receiver.

I am wondering how to search for this on E-Bay.  What's an 
access point verses a router?  Can you get the equivalent 
of a 10/100baseTX ethernet hub for 802.11b networks?  I 
don't think I need a firewall box and I don't need 
cable/DSL connectivity.

I'm interested in something in the $20-$30 range.

Another option is to see about extending the monitor,
keyboard, and mouse 20-30' through conduit into the other
room.

Anyone know if the battery for an APC smart SU1000 works in an
APC smart SU1000NET?

Are there any usb based devices which work under Linux that 
go between a computer's power cord and it's power supply
to meter the computer's power use?

There are cheap solar panels on E-Bay from new Volkswagon bugs
that plug into the cigarette lighter to keep the battery
topped off, has anyone thought to use these for auxiliary
computer power?  You might want to cut the cigarette plugs
off.  I'm sure a couple of these are enough to run the
standard computer, I think 10 of them can produce 180 
watts, which may only be 90 watts of AC power.  Perhaps 
instead of a large ups, a better approach is: small 
battery, solar panels, and fall back generator.  Why 
use stored energy if you can produce what you need and
and avoid the use of large numbers of huge lead acid 
batteries?  Lead acid batteries are expensive, short 
lived, toxic to the environment, heavy, and fairly 
limited in their charge capacity for the space they 
take up.  If lead acid batteries stored significantly 
more charge in less space and weighed a lot less, 
electric cars would be practical and ups'es would be 
cheaper to ship.

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix or Mailscanner problem...
Message-ID: <1133126045.438a219d88b99@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Every time I send to an unreachable email address, Mailscanner increases
it's resource use until the kernel's anti thrashing code turns it off.
Uge!  I want it to give up instead.  I don't know if my postfix configuration

Danger Will Robinson!  Some older laptops will not boot from drives larger
than 8GB - they cannot address more than 2^24 sectors.  Other laptops
will address up to 137GB ( LBA28 ) using Linux drivers but not with
Windoze/DOS drivers.  The newest laptops may permit full LBA48, or
141PB ( Peta = 10^15 ).  I don't know where the Portege lives on this 
spectrum, but if you have problems this may be one reason.  Definitely
build the larger disk with a small ( <= 1GB ) boot partition!

And make sure /boot is at the front/lowest address of the drive, if
that wasn't obvious.

Those old Portege laptops are amazing to me.  I have one that is
destined to become a digital picture frame one of these days if I ever
get my act together.  Anybody ever tried to do that?  I know there's
some articles/blogs about it out there.  I only wish I could get the
Portege to boot off a usb drive (less noise), but alas the BIOS
doesn't seem to support that.

Russell,

   That gains me no more than I currently have with the LinkSys 4-port switch
connected to the 318. I leave the printers on the latter because it doesn't
matter if data moves slowly into their RAM.

   Yes, I'd prefer to save hacking time, but I believe that ultimately it will
save me time and money since I can keep the OS upgraded and current and tweak
firewall rules as necessary.

Subject: [PLUG] Copyleft bad for open source?
Message-ID: <1133200144.15098.7.camel@localhost.localdomain>

The Enterprise Open Source Journal recently ran an article entitled
?When Copyleft Is Bad for Open Source? by Mark Driver of Gartner. In it,
Driver makes the proposition that the GPL and other copyleft licenses
are ?wrong?, ?second class? and possibly against the ?ethos of open
source?.

I thought about it for awhile and decided to pen a response:

http://www.news4neighbors.net/article.pl?sid=05/11/28/1732242

I'd appreciate any comments people might make as I'm considering putting
together an article an the issue and sending to the EOSJ.

Thanks,

David

It gains you something that works without investing a lot of thought.
5 minutes plugging in wires and you are done.  You go from "broken" to
"works great".

Keith,

   First, it is a 40G drive, not a 60G; I just opened the package to check.
Second, the Portege is 6 years old, but most likely supports > 8G drives. The
ThinkPad 600E we have is of the same vintage and I replaced that drive with a
20G (or similar). It's worked just fine. Third, I always make /boot about
25-50M; it doesn't need any more than that.

   Thanks for the heads-up, though! I remember the old BIOSs that could not
boot -- or see -- drives greater than 500M, then 8G.

Jason,

   When I ran Red Hat (4.1-7.3), I could always mount /boot at /dev/hda1.
Slackware, however, (8.0-10.2) insists on having / at /dev/hda1, but it lets
me put /boot at /dev/hda2. I went a few rounds with cfdisk on this issue when
I first switched distributions. Since then I've just let it win from the
beginning. :-)

   What I really like about the 3025CT I have is the small size (it's only 1
inch thick when closed) and light weight (1 kg). It's no problem to carry all
day long. The double weight of my Sony Vaio is really noticeable when I lug
my portable office on trips.

Subject: [PLUG] Kernel IPX networking...
Message-ID: <s38afbdf.056@mail.assuredtechsolutions.com>

NetWare is not needed to use IPX.  IPX can be configured to work in all 4 Ethernet frame types, just make sure you set the same frame type on all systems in the network for a specific logical network.  If you want multiple logical networks on the same physical network, you can use the different frame formats to define separate logical networks.

IPV6 works much like IPX with regard to automatic node/host addressing. Not sure Warcraft will work with that though.

>>> plug_0 at robinson-west.com 11/24/2005 3:41 pm >>>
For fun I've thought about using IPX in Linux.  Also, Warcraft II works
over it.  Why use IPX instead of IP?  Is Netware needed?  What frame
type do I use?  Can more than one frame type be used on the same
media?  Has anyone thought of developing an open source alternative

I believe they are called repeaters.  Here's one, but it does all the
things you list below as not needing, and is out of your specified
price range:
	
D-Link / DWL-2100AP / 108Mbps / 802.11g / Wireless Access Point:

That should give you the keywords you need, I leave the googling for
exactly what you want up to you. (since I'm not looking for one
immediately, although I admit that I'd like to know what you find)

It seems like an easier alternative to extending the peripherals is to
run cat-5 and make that link wired.  If you *do* put long cables on
your peripherals, expect to experience some degradation of
performance, particularly on the monitor.  I suppose that distance may
even make the screen useless, but that is really beyond my expertise.

I wish I could have read the original.  I can do Flash and just about
any media and website on my Ubuntu system, but I think you have to be
running IE on Winders to access their ASP-based site.  I'd question
their perspective on OSS, but I'm not their target-market anyway.

Your response is interesting, and you clearly have some strong ideas,
but they could perhaps be stated more clearly.  I was having a hard
time making out which license (or class of licenses) was which, and
I suspect that was inherited from the muddled arguments of the
original piece.

I've seen and heard a lot of muddled arguments about how a BSD-
licensed Linux kernel would be better for bidness, mostly from
bidness folks with no OSS background*.  There are many responses to
them, but the best IMHO is, "if you don't like it, use BSD Unix."

Many businesspeople want to justify taking stuff from the Commons.
Witness the various copyright fights, timber battles and land-grabs
going on.  To me, this is no different.

You may find these interesting:

 relicensing Linux is within the realm of possibility.

OK, this is a little over the top. I normally enjoy your long and
detailed messages, but this one is a little too religious for my taste.

Let me point out my bias immediately: I suggested to Dr. Shepard that
the Netgear VPN box would be a nice safe replacement for his ancient (in
PC-years) firewall. In the last 9 years I have had one Netgear device
fail, and I have never had a reason to call their tech support. I
currently have 6 Netgear devices in my office, and a couple more in a
colo cabinet, and I support 4 of these FVS318s at clients' offices along
with many switches from 4 to 24 ports.

Future reconfiguration would be the same if a nice notebook-based
firewall/router failed and lost some critical component, like a hard
drive. The FVS318 has no moving parts, so the most common failure would
be the power brick. You can back up your configuration on any PC that
can run a browser with Javascript. This is not significantly different
from a *BSD-based firewall, except that you only have to back up one
file with the appliance, vs. many configuration files with a *BSD box.

Adapting to new protocols is as easy as a firmware update, unless you're
talking about experimental protocols, or those that are not yet widely
adopted. I don't see a problem with this for a device that is sitting on
the public internet, and whose sole purpose is to facilitate some work
that is NOT experimenting with networking protocols.

This is what a firewall appliance provides, along with extremely low
maintenance. And this shopping list is what inspired me to suggest the
Netgear device.

Or he could spend a relatively large pile of money for a nice firewall
appliance like the Fortigate 60 (I have three in my office, 2 NIB and
for sale!) which runs Linux and has a nice non-browser-specific web UI,
but it will take several days to read the manual and figure out all the
access groups and firewall settings and WAN vs. DMZ vs. LAN settings and
all the stuff he'll have to deal with if he rolls his own.

I love to tinker, but there comes a point where I just want to surf the
web and read my mail without having to consider how many transistors are
involved with each and every keystroke or mouse click. That's why I buy
firewall appliances. Oh, and no fans!

I'm a little worried about tomorrow night's PLUG meeting since
we try to keep PLUG's schedule as consistent as possible.

As a result, people (like me), who don't keep up with their
email could miss the fact the we are having Jeff Waugh speak
tomorrow night.

So, please call people who you think should know about this; 
but may not.

Also, if anyone wants to post a flyer I built one and put it
on our web site at:

Rob,

   No.

   It's the switch part of the Netgear FVS318 that's constipated. I put the
two desktops and my notebook on a separate Linksys switch, then connected
that switch to the Netgear. Internal transfers go through the Linksys only;
printing and 'Net access are routed through the Netgear.

I contacted University of Portland, Lewis & Clark, and Reed.

I guess I forgot PSU; but we have a number of PSU people like
Dennis so I guess I was assuming they would get the word.
This is probably a bad assumption.

Ron,

As a PSU student (linguistics, not computer science), I logged in 
and checked the computer science department's web site. After 
poking around for a while I found an "upcoming events' link and 
guess what I found posted there?

It looks like it's listed. Except it appears to have gone only to the 
faculty list. I don't know if there is a separate list for students. Also 
not sure if these notices are automatically sent to e-mail boxes or 
just posted on their website.

Open source enthusiasts will be interested in the following -- please
pass the word!

It's the Final Appearance of the Badger Badger Badger Tour!

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BadgerBadgerBadgerTour and

Who:        Jeff Waugh of Ubuntu & GNOME fame
When:   Tuesday 11/29 7:30pm
Where:  Vanport Room #338
        Smith Memorial Student Union
        Portland Statue University
        http://www.pdx.edu/map.html (it's on grid C6)

Jeff Waugh will be travelling for a month and a half, criss-crossing
the northern hemisphere, to bring the world of Ubuntu to your
doorstep. Expect badgers, mushrooms, schnaaaaaakes, an awful 
lot of
Ubuntu CDs, and a healthy dose of madcap hijinks.

So who the heck is Jeff Waugh?

Here's some info on Jeff (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JeffWaugh)

				 PRESENTATION

			       Final Appearance
			  Badger Badger Badger Tour

      Jeff Waugh has been traveling for a month and a half, criss-crossing
      the northern hemisphere, to bring the world of Ubuntu to our
      doorstep.  His final stop is Portland before going back to 
      his home in Australia.

      More details:

           http://www.badgerbadgerbadger.com/
           https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JeffWaugh

      Jeff has been GNOME Release Manager (2001-2005), Director of 
      the GNOME Foundation Board (2003-2004), president of the Sydney 
      Linux User's Group (2002-2004), and member of the linux.conf.au 
      2001 organising team. 

      Jeff will be talking about Ubuntu Linux, GNOME, the role of Free/
      Open Source Software in developing countries (and the US, of course).
      Expect badgers, mushrooms, schnaaaaaakes, an awful lot of
      Ubuntu CDs, and a healthy dose of madcap hijinks.

I'm all for ODF, and have started to use it in OO.o 2.0, but this
article raises some relevant concerns:

Below is a handy list to take to Fry's.  Couldn't find G at Fry's a
month ago that was old enough.  Had to get a GS.  This list should be
checked against this one:

http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware

The first 4 digits in the serial number (look on the box or the
underside of the router) represent the hardware revision:

CDF1 = WRT54G v1.0
CDF2 = WRT54G v1.1

This is a very detailed discussion of accessibility, and he seems to
have some detailed information about the accessibility needs within the
MA government, but I have not yet seen any numbers. How many people need
access to MA government documents in ODF and can't view/hear them? 

If there are three people who can't do word processing via a voice
processor in ODF docs, give them early retirement and the state will
still be saving $millions. I know, that's not PC. But should the rest of
the state be held hostage by those three people? The fact that no one
has mentioned numbers suggessts to my paranoid/experienced mind that the
numbers are really insignificant (except to Microsoft and the affected
people themselves, of course).

Oops, I'm not writing about Linux. OK, it should be possible to script
this so that those people can continue to use Word until the ODF tools
are available. I imagine them using a web form to choose the file and
the final destination, then the form action translates the doc into ODF
using code extracted from OOo2 and saves it in the specified
destination.

I'm all for appropriate accessibility. I have a cousin who was almost
completely deaf until recently (experimental surgery that was quite
successful), yet he could write and play music by watching the
waveforms. But forcing the a state government to continue to pay MS
because of a very small number of people is not in the best interest of
the whole of the people of that state.

Remember that the reason MA is moving to ODF is not because of money,
but because of openness.  There is no requirement to use
OpenOffice.org, nor is there a requirement to NOT use MS Office,
except for the current lack of support for ODF.

Pulling a slashdot-subscriber here and reading neither the original
article nor your comment, but simply responding to this brief summary,
my response would be something like:

The GPL is great, because it allows people who want a certain kind of
freedom to safely license their code.

The BSD license is great, because it allows people who want a certain
kind of freedom to safely license their code.

The goals of these two groups overlap, but the distinction has to be
weighed consciously.  A blind faith to either method means religious
wars, not sane discussions.

Also, it's important to understand the consequences of even slight
changes to the license.  Witness the fiasco of Apache and Xfree86
changing their licenses slightly... entire user communities ended up
forking distros just to keep the old licenses.

I address this issue (and others) in my "Free Software, a look back, a
look ahead" talk, <http://www.ourmedia.org/node/15118>.  However, the
slides don't really convey the text that I include on those slides,
and the notes are only in my head, sorry. :)

I'd be happy to give that talk at a future PLUG meeting though.

Accessibility is a function of the productivity software, not of the
document format. Find here how groups working with the disabled are
expressing anger with Microsoft for not supporting ODF in Office 12:

  http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/47810/index.html

Besides, what vender, after having moved for the ODF, wants to be caught
without an answer to accessability to a large Government customer?

I know my business wouldn't, no way. To put it another way, if MA asked
Sun or IBM to create an accessability module for OpenOffice, I gaurantee
you that it would be done.

Here's a prediction: when MA follows through with the ODF standard, the
relevant major software vendors will suddenly find it not so difficult
to provide ODF support and, inherently, accessability features.

Anyone know the option to remove restrictions on pasting a lot of

Guy Kawasaki sent out a pointer to another presentation that interest
other PLUGgers.  You can find the talk at  http://tinyurl.com/dfzxx  or
http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/

Dick Hardt, Founder & CEO, Sxip Identity, is working on an open source,
non-central-server approach to digital credentials.  The presentation
runs 15 minutes, and is available in flash, wmv, and quicktime.

This was presented as a keynote at OSCON 2005 in Portland, and is
probably the most energetic slide show I've ever seen.  Good ideas
and great eye candy.  I will bring it to the PLUG meeting tonight
and perhaps present it before the main meeting starts at 730, as a
warm-up cartoon for Jeff Waugh .

I have a sun Ultra1E w/4 port 100MB nic.  I have been using
debian-ultrasparc with the hardening packages and the shorewall firewall
script.  I also use wondershaper to do some packetshaping.  It has
worked wonderfully.  

The box was $15.00 on ebay, and it comes with a console port for OOB
management.

If you go this route, let me know I can send you some configuration
recommendations.

I ran a router / firewall on a dedicated linux box for years.. the
last time  I moved I just replaced it with a wireless router (well, in
the process throwing away one layer of protection, obviously).  I
believe the netgear I'm using now uses less power, and I know it's
quieter.  I did like the linux router though, it was a p-166 w/ 64megs
of ram, about 500 megs of disk space, a floppy drive, and two nicks,
of course.

I ran debian with iptables (once it was available) and had to reboot
it about once every 18 months to move it, along with the rest of my
other furniture.

The short of it: It was fun, way more power than I needed, a little
large, and on the noisy end of things for what I needed.  I'd like the
functionality it offered me, but the tradeoffs aren't worth it in my
living situation.

I run RedHat 9.0 with IPTables on both of my server locations.

I run a paranoid ip script that blocks everything that I haven't expressly
opened.

It has been going strong for 3+ years now.

I run a LEAF Bering-uClibc firewall.  It uses shorewall for firewall 
configuration and hosts a few extra services like traffic shaping, DNS 
and OpenVPN.  LEAF is pretty easy to get running.  It can run from 
floppy, CD, hard drive, compact flash, etc., and doesn't need much RAM.

http://leaf.sourceforge.net/bering-uclibc/

I run it on a little fanless Soekris 4801 from compact flash.  It 
connects 6 network segments, including wireless, 2 DMZs and a VPN.  I 
pretty much never have to fuss with it.  It's easily the most flexible 
& yet worry-free server I've ever put together.  It replaced a regular 
distro on regular hardware firewall that was too far from worry-free 
for my taste.

I might suggest trying out a floppy install first regardless of what 
media the firewall will actually use, as the docs are geared toward 
floppies.  The rest is pretty simple once you grok the LEAF package 
setup & lifecycle.

Depends on what you want to do.  For just firewalling, anything in the 
last several years should do, 64MB mem, etc.  I used an AMD K6 350 
underclocked to 233, fanless.  But when I added squid and Dans Guardian 
it wasn't enough.

Everything has maintenance. :)

I haven't tried anything slower than a 266mhz with 16MB RAM
that worked fine.

Remember to rotate the logs once in awhile.  Better yet log to another
host on your network and rotate those logs on a regular basis. 

It behooves you to pay attention to security alerts / available patches
for the distrubution your FW is based on.  

Resist the temptation to use the box for other purposes, NTP server,
web server or whatever.  Perhaps, just maybe, use it for IDS.

You can have lots of fun by reviewing the logs and seeing what's 
flowing or not.  

> etc

Great Fun!  The syntax of the config file is not that difficult so
you should try rolling your own.

Do so by setting the default to drop all.
Open ports until you get what you need.
Stop there.

You can change the ruleset on an ad hoc basis to block whoever is the
currently troublesome miscreant in your neighborhood.  Since there's so
many miscreants it's best to have a log monitoring program do that on
your behalf.

I've gone multiple routes for building GNU/Linux firewall systems.  I used to
write my own scripts.  Then I tried fwbuilder[1] as it was easy to visually see
what was going on for maintaining multiple firewall configs, build and deploy
them.  The portability feature was nice with fwbuilder (works for
pf/iptables/pix etc).

Recently I find myself using Shorewall[2].  Easy to setup, and easy to make
changes or expand the system (add another NIC, create a DMZ, or a VPN).  I'm
also using it for host(non-routing) firewalls.  A bit overkill, but the app
isn't large and it provides a common interface for maintaining a lot of hosts
running iptables.  Shorewall also provides a nice way to do QoS(tc).

I'm currently experimenting with keeping shorewall configs in an SVN repository.
 I'm trying to find better ways for doing change management on hosts.  So far
I've had good results.

All of this has been on a mix of mostly Debian sarge, and a bit of Ubuntu
hedgehog/badger.  The benefit of having a full GNU/Linux environment is if I
need to do some analysis, I can install the packages I need, do what I need to
do, and uninstall the packages.  The logging capabilities are there too.

Another path I've recently taken is OpenBSD/pf.  The code auditing and security
minded techniques appeal to me, and the pf design is powerful.  OpenBSD on a
soekris would be perfect.

[1] http://www.fwbuilder.org/
[2] http://www.shorewall.net/

Simple QoS script:
http://lartc.org/wondershaper/

One day I would like to see a bakeoff between a GNU/Linux firewall installed on
a carrier-grade PC, armed with a lot of gig ports, against a PIX and a Netscreen.

   From 1 June 1999 until the middle of last September I ran a floppfw box. I
worked great until it died. There were four reboots: a motherboard failure
after seven months, an attempt to upgrade floppyfw from 1.09, and two power
outages here.

   Not bad performance for 6.25 years.

I have done it for years.  I just build a minimum system with iptables 
and then google for a good script.  I then put it in a cabinet shut the 
door and forget it.  The latest one I have built for work has redundant 
t1's to it so if the primary goes down there is the other it falls back to.

This page has some good ones to get one started.

I think the text size limit is kind of hard coded into the IRCd, and not
enforced through the configuration. AFAIK, it's a standard number. A good

Subject: [PLUG] ODF Format: Call For Documentation
Message-ID: <1133372133.5578.20.camel@localhost>

Friends,

Please pardon the cross-post. I am writing this morning to call for
documentation with regard to Massachusetts mandate that all MA documents
be written in an open, standard format by January 1, 2007.

This issue is bound to come up in Oregon so we need to be ready. I will
compile this information and post it to a web site for decision makers
to are looking for comprehensive information. Some of you will recall
the work we did for HB2892, the "Open Source Consideration Bill" linked
here:

  http://cooper.stevenson.name/open_source_cd/

In short, I call upon each of you to send links to statements and
articles from officials and the press as appropriate. It is critical
that when this issue arises in Oregon (and it will) that the Open Source
community is prepared.

I look forward to hearing from you. 


Respectfully Yours,


Cooper Stevenson

Hi there,

It has come to my attention that I mistakenly attributed the Jeff
Waugh presentation (which I podcasted) to PDX LUG, not the correct
PLUG.  I have corrected the domain name so you can now access this
podcast at:

http://plug.podasp.com/

Sorry for the confusion.  If anyone would like to assist with the CSS
to spiff up this interface, or if there are other podcasts which you
want hosting for, please contact me.

Thanks.
Chris

I ended up buying her a Samsung ML-2010 from Compusa, $130 with a
$70 rebate.  This comes with a CD and a PDF manual with explicit
Linux install procedures and drivers.  The device is fast and
reasonably small.  The interface is USB2, but SUSE 10 deals with
that just fine.  This may actually be superior to an Ethernet
connection, because it means she will not be using the ethernet port
for anything but 'net connection, making the firewall task simpler.

The Samsung drivers actually create an embarrasment of riches.  The
printer uses a proprietary-but-open Samsung Printer Language (SPL),
and the ML-1710 ppd file that came with SUSE talks to it just fine. 
However, many of the features seem to be only accessable though the
Samsung provided interface driver, LPPR, which appears to bypass the
SUSE-preferred CUPS.   While LPPR is open source, do I want to risk
SUSE compatability to get more functionality?  My temptation is to
stay with CUPS, because the extra features will probably be added 
to CUPS soon.  Suggestions?

Keith

PS - this is a *really* inexpensive printer - it does not even come
with a USB cable, you must have or buy one.  The toner cartridges are
about twice as expensive per page as my HP laserjet 4Ms, but in both
cases I can do a drill and fill.  We will see how long the drums last.

Subject: [PLUG] Scope for a Postfix server...
Message-ID: <1133330596.438d40a4ecdfc@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

The default for postfix 2.x seems to be, "talk with any smtp server that 
can see me."  A postfix smtp site can accept data from smtp servers 
that can see it even if it can't reach them.  Oops, this can lead to
a clogged defer queue incredibly fast.

This problem could be solved by having the postfix site, site A,
use a map of the world that is limited so it can refuse to 
communicate with servers it can't reach. 
 
                        public  |  private
     /----------\               |
     | INTERNET |            /-----\          /---\
     |          | ---------- |  C  |----------| A |
     | /----\   |            \-----/          \---/
     | | B  |   |               |
     | \----/   |               |
     \----------/               |

Site A is hidden on a private network hosted by the gateway, Site C.

There is one host on the Internet that is supposed to be able to
reach site A over it.  Unfortunately, this host uses a dynamic ip.

I don't want ratholes jamming garbage into Site A.  Site A trys to 
bounce the garbage back and then defers it when it can't connect
to the ratholes.  I only want to service host B off of the net.  
Site A should not defer anything to/from the Internet that is
not to/from Site B.

Since Site A firewalls outbound smtp requests to it's local subnet 
and site B, one thought is to have a parallel change occur at site 
C.  Have site C do destination nat for site B only.  Can't do it, 
easytcp on site C and easytcp on site A are incompatible.  For
now, site C does destination nat for site B's subnet, 65k hosts.

Even if the firewalls at Site C and Site A change in parallel,
what's to stop jamming of the defer queue at site A if a local 
user attempts to email a site that site A can resolve, but not 
connect to?  

Can postfix know that a site it's trying to reach is blocked 
for a reason and not just down?  Do I solve the worldview problem
at site A by doing parallel packet filter changes at site A and
site C?  Do I need to configure site A in a special way?

Masquerading and destination nat can get you into another ip 
network, but information is lost at the destination concerning 
the true source of your packets.
