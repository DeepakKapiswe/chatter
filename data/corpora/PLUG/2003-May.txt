Lars Larson is a major local personality.
He is well known in Oregon and Washington.  He used to be of
one of the local TV stations - I think channel 12, but I don't
remember for sure.
He was also married to Deb Jaynes who is another well known
local personality.  They  are no longer married - well not to
each other.

Lars Larson writes or used to write a newspaper column, and he
has been hosting a local topic radio talk show on AM 860 which
is broadcast by stations around Oregon.

My impression of Lars Larson is that he is very conservative
and not always very fair to his guests but better than any
of the other local alternatives.  He certainly is not one
of the hate mongers.  However, sometimes he cuts guests
off and twists their words around.

On balance, I think Lars Larson would be a great show to be on.
Moreover, if we presented things right he might see this as
a way of preventing waste in state government which is one of
his favorite causes.

I listen to him and have read things he has written, but I
haven't ever met him in person.

Subject: [PLUG] Starband blues...
Message-ID: <20030501101724.7523.qmail@goose.robinson-west.com>

I really hate winproxy and starbands anti Linux anti Mac focus.

A company I'm trying to help, Micron Laser off wagon way near 26 and 
Cornelius, wants to run rsync to update a directory on two 2000 servers
that are supposed to have the same data.  If this data is wrong it could cost
Micron thousands of dollars as they do laser work on printed circuit boards
under contract and have to eat their mistakes.  The datum are Lumonics etc.
files that the machines actually run.  Merix is letting the shop play with one
of their machines for free and has provided real time drivers for Linux where
my brother has put together a debian machine and ported these drivers to 
the 2.4 kernel.  Great, right?!?  Almost, the stupid
Starband 360 satellite modem and winproxy aren't Linux friendly :-\  

I've been plugging away at google, but any link to how to make starband 360 
work under Linux seems broken and I haven't been able to find any information 
on any other two way satellite alternative that actually routes properly.
Also, I doubt there's any way for Micron to sell the Starband 360 to switch
to another satellite.  I have found sites that say efforts to get the 
information to do the compression that is needed for writing starband 360 
Linux drivers have failed.  A number of other sites say that there is 
no chance this is going to change.  There's some word that wine may 
get starband to work on a Linux router, but I don't know if this would allow 
substituting say netfilter with masquerading for winproxy.  I wonder if dns 
requests and rsync can go out on a starband 360 satellite or if that is 
impossible.

Is there any way to get dselect, wget, ftp, anything other than opera with
proxy set to work through starband 360?

My brother thinks cygwin is the answer, but I really doubt it.  I don't like 
the idea of having to come up with a custom proxy program on Windows
2000 to catch the dns, ftp, http, etc. queries of Linux machines that are
not expecting a proxy.  Linux wants dns and that seems broken with
winproxy.

Why is starband forcing or trying to force businesses and others to stick
with Windows?  What is the danger of their compression algorithm being
available to the general public so that someone can write a Linux driver?
Couldn't they have placed the compression in the modem and made the
starband 360 an ordinary router friendly to any machine that speaks 
tcp/ip?  Processors are so cheap these days.

Are there any Linux friendly two way satellite alternatives covering the
area where Cornelius Pass and Highway 26 meet?

... trimmed ...

Since Starband requires that Windows software be installed and you're
syncing the Windows systems it makes sense to use rsync on the Windows
systems themselves:

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=rsync+for+windows

If you want to find a new ISP (sounds like you may want to anyhow), then
the site http://www.dslreports.com often has good info, such as:

http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,6493543~root=sat~mode=flat

This guy is running a Linux-based appliance through StarBand using a WinXP
system as a router:

http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,6316973~root=sat~mode=flat

He does not give enough details to duplicate the config, but says:

"We recently got our StarBand system up and running. We are running Sat
Modem --- stripped down XP pro ICS box w/ remote management --- Toshiba
SG20 server --- LAN. All are connected in a linear fashion and in that
order."

The big competition to StarBand seems to be Direcway.  The biggest gripe
about them is that they reduce your bandwidth if you use it too much in a
short timeframe.  (The Fair Access Policy)  Since it sounds like you plan
to send a reasonable amount of data across, this probably would not work
well for you.

Most likely, it's not compatible with the new threading model that RH
introduced with RH 9. 

Just one of the pitfalls of being on that bleeding edge.

Since you can't compile from source, you'll have to wait until Real
releases a compatible version, or go back to RH 8.

  Thanks, Steve. I wasn't aware of its existance. I think the last time I
used a hexeditor was in the mid-1980s fixing DOS files.

  The hexedit man page says that one can search but doesn't tell us how to
initiate the search. Only that the full hex values must be entered. Strange.

Thanks--this at least narrows it down.  That's about all I wanted to
know.

I've had (fatal) troubles, too. I've run strace against it a couple
times, but nothing definitive has shown up. My hunch is that it's a 
threading issue with NPTL, but at this point it's only a hunch.

  Mea culpa! Just didn't see it the first few times: ctrl-s for forward
search; ctrl-r for reverse. Cool tool.

Ok, what is ICS under Windows 2000 Server and if Winproxy is removed what
steps need to be taken to protect the 2000 server and allow a Linux router 
behind it to do routing and packet filtering?

    I am looking at the following setup:

laser machines on             90.0.0.0/24 network

laser machines on             91.0.0.0/24 network

personal computers on     92.0.0.0/24 network

laser machines on             93.0.0.0/24 network
     . 
     .
     .

there  could be another but it this is good enough...

Current Windows 2000 server gateway with 5 nics where one goes to satellite
box and the others connect to each of the above networks.

There could be a Merix key on the current winproxy server that Merix needs
to access for the laser machines to work.  I believe this 2000 server can 
serve the Merix key and close all other services  that aren't initiated from
inside the shop.  Mail is through imap or pop3 from satellite provider and 
needs to be virus filtered before it is picked up by any of the personal 
computers.  The Merix key plugs in to the parallel port where other than it 
the winproxy machine is the closest the business can get to the equivalent 
of having a network bridge.  Trouble is that it isn't working as a proper 
bridge right now where the transparent proxy feature is broken,  otherwise 
Linux would be able to go out.  On google, tech tips has a suggestion to use
ICS and stay away from winproxy because it isn't supported by Starband
or Microsoft.

I think a standard forwarding Linux router is needed behind Windows ICS 
server and that this router should host all the private networks that winproxy
currently should, but can't.  Winproxy would be removed.  Would a Linux 
router use masquerading or not?  If not, where can I get info on writing 
forwarding rules under iptables to go from say network A to network B?
DNS requests say on net A need to be on net B, ICS network, where the 
windows gateway will move it on to the Internet from there.  Net B is
different than what I have already worked with because it is another
private network where I have only ever done a router that goes from 
private to public.

As far as rsync on Windows, good tip.  I should point out that the 2000
server that hosts this directory is on a private subnet right now and because
ftp doesn't work through winproxy the shop has been using 56k dialup and 
pc anywhere.  The latter is what my brother and I have been asked to
fix first.  He's trying to write a proxy today thinking he can enable routing 
of dns and ftp through an application layer socket.  I'd like to find a 
solution that doesn't involve writing Windows software as results 
can't be predicted and making a mess would not be good.  The job 
is to prevent a thirty thousand dollar loss as unintrusively as possible.

<gripe>
Maybe a bill should be passed that bans software modems for which no 
information is made available to competitors of the system the software is 
written for.  Considering that this satellite company has a monopoly on two
way satellite technology that even comes close to what DSL is, this
win modem abuse is not a trivial problem.  You can't even use this 
satellite on a Mac directly where they could have distributed a binary.
Unfortunately, the cost of sending a satellite into orbit and the limited
real estate in space is partially to blame for this abusive situation as
the latter high costs prevent competition.  Not to mention, I think Microsoft
is responsible for placing anticompetitive pressure on Starband.  Another
right I think that neds to be protected is the right to not register
a hardware or software product even if it is commercial and proprietary
because of all the junk email/mail problems and the intrusiveness of that.
If I'm not mistaken, XP breaks when you can't query an internet registration
database and Microsoft audits whatever they want whenever they want. 
It's legal to run Linux, but what can stop Microsoft from breaking their
own operating systems remotely because they want Linux users to 
have problems that will lead them to Windows for everything?
What prevents blackmail, "it's either our system or no system"?
<\gripe>

NOTE:  ICS is the Microsoft Internet Connection Sharing software.

If there is a routable broadband alternative, broadband without Windows,
I can suggest it.  I doubt there is though, but it is the case that houses 
are coming closer and I have seen the comcast van near this area from 
when I was going to Rock Creek this Winter.  Can the starband 360 
satellite be sold or traded for a comcast cable modem?  It limits my
ability to do progamming for this shop if this Internet connectivity is
broken and I need the money.  I earned my general studies degree
but I unforunately didn't get physics or the third and fourth term of
Calculus.  I'm also missing discrete math and object oriented 
programming.  In some ways I might help on this project to build
good will more than anything, but I don't want to work in a Microsoft
environment unless I absolutely have to.

Thanks for the response, I sure hope this isn't spam :-)

Try to get SSH working.  Once that is going you can tunnel both VNC (for
PCAnywhere-like functions) and rsync (for file transfer) over the same SSH
transport layer.

As much as you might want to avoid Cygwin, in this case it is likely to
make your life very easy.  Cygwin now comes with a working ssh/sshd
package, but I don't think it's part of the default install. 
(http://cygwin.com/packages/)

For info on getting VNC to work over SSH see:

This sounds like overkill.  Fun, but overkill.  FTP is notoriously bad at
being transparently tunnelled, as I'm sure he will discover soon.  ;-)

No matter what transfer method you choose, I suggest the following:
  + archive the files into a single file (i.e. ZIP, TAR, etc.)
  + checksum the file on both the source and destination sides
  + compare the checksums to be sure the file came over OK
    - do this in addition to any checksums the archiver does
    - MD5SUM for Windows can be found at:
      http://downloads.activestate.com/contrib/md5sum/Windows/

This will help prevent or at least detect that one of these valuable files
didn't make it.

It renders fine with Mozilla 1.2.1 on Windoze. I'm not near a Linux box

Message-ID: <200305021031.16651.matt@legalizefreedom.org>

The way Mr. Barber puts this reminds me of an analysis I once read about 
organized crime at the turn of the century. A few "clean" politicians would 
listen to reason and try to create legislation to clean up their act while 
the rest secretly pocketed large amounts of money and, for a long while, 
nothing changed.

The scene is different but the actions are the same. 

I guess we could take a look at history and see how, in the face of large 
dollars lobbying politicians towards "the dark side", a grass-roots movement 
can change the law. In the past this took the face of a heavy media campaign, 
letting people know what was happening. This involved some heavy-duty 
journalism, getting to the source, finding who was taking money (and why) and 
letting people know the reasons behind why their politicians did not vote to 
outlaw organized crime. The problem being that taking money is very 
commonplace today (and people are so "over-media"ed that they will not listen 
unless something is particularly seedy or interesting.) Our politicians and 
leaders can take "contributions" and be "forced" to "listen" to corporations 
(like Microsoft). People don't care because they are not that interested in 
what their computers run. People see Microsoft as a great corporation that 
contributes money to schools and non-profits.

Perhaps this bill is "too much, too soon". It is also reminiscent of the 
marijuana legalization bills that, inevitably, will be on the ballot every 
other year. Peoples opinions are too closed. They don't know what this bill 
means. They don't know what open source software is. They know Windoze, 
because they use it at work (and at home on their crappy PC they bought at 
best buy or the home shopping network) and they feel threatened by something 
they don't know, and don't understand. 

I guess what I'm getting at is that part of the reason this billed failed is 
not just Mircosoft's intervention (we all know that is the REAL reason). Our 
government is currently organized to give a bigger voice to the corporate 
influence. Whether this is right or not, it is LEGAL and the strategy of open 
source must act accordingly..

That said, does anyone have any ideas on how to combat having a neighbor like 
M$ next door? No matter what the legislation, they are close enough that they 
will interfere with almost anything that goes on in our capitol. We will 
always have to deal with weak politicians and deep pockets of M$ lobbying. 
How can we get around this? How do you convince people that a big company 
that they may not like (though secretly admire and envy) is bad news when it 
comes to the bottom line?

Really enjoyed Ken Barber's opinion piece today.  

For those of you who don't know (and even for those who do), I am
running for Portland School Board.  Just for the record, as a Board

and kick Micro$oft out of our schools.  We need to save money and this
seems an obvious step.

I hope you support me and I would appreciate your vote on election day..

I think "Kicking Microsoft out of our schools" isn't the right approach
as it is what most students will see in the work place and you won't get
many parents to support this.  I think a better approach is to convince
people that the combination of many types of software platforms is the
best way to allow the students to have a wider range of knowledge as
well as save some money.  We all know that Open Source Software has made
a large surge into the business market, but it has a long way to go.
Getting children familiar with it at an early age is important, but you
won't get into a position to promote it if you are threatening to take
away what is familiar.  Microsoft has it place as does Open Source.
Good luck convincing parents that what 90 percent of them have at home
isn't what their children will be learning.  You would have better luck
explaining to them that they can still use what they have, as well as

Hello,
Your declaration to kick out Microsoft from the public schools is
noble and it deserves support from the Linux community.
However, do you have any feasible plans on how actually do this?
Otherwise, how is it to be different from those corrupt 
politicians, who promise golden mountains during their election
campaigns and shortly forget about everything when they reach 
the office?
Could you please post here your detailed plan or program on how 
you're going to push Microsoft from the public schools.

Regards.
Alex

This argument worked really, really well trying to get rid of the
Macintoshes in schools ;-) 

Also, to harp on the "schools don't teach products, they teach skills"
critique once more . . . 

Our educators should *not* be teaching a specific word processor or
spreadsheet, but the general idea of how to use a word processor or
spreadsheet.  As such, I'd say it's a good idea to "kick Microsoft out
of our schools" and teach vendor-neutral skills rather than MS-specific
ones.  

Additionally, by the time our K-12 students get into the workplace, who
is to say that Microsoft Office will still be such a dominant force? (I,
for one, highly doubt it, especially for the 'K' students).  Teaching
skills on a 3rd party application forces a focus on the skill, not the
product simply because you cannot ignore the fact that it may work
differently on a Microsoft product.

That's fine with me, parent's don't get to dictate curriculum in other
areas, why should they here? (and my above arguments apply, although it
sounds like we largely agree . . .)

I too am at a loss as to how to fight outright bribery.

This guy has some good points,
http://newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=03/04/30/1926238
be sure to read the comments at the end as well.  One suggests involving 
unions in the FOSS push.  As weak as many unions are in the US, some still 
have the weight to fight rotten politicians.

Speaking of which, is there a union to represent IT workers?

Please don't. It's not topical for the list. As someone who lives in
Washington County, it does not pertain to me at all.

IMNSHO, if it's posted publically, it should be put on your own web
page. I'd much rather see a link to that, rather than this long involved
debate. (Which this WILL become, in another message or two.)

Thank you.

I admit I was being a little flippant due to time contraints.  I have
been too busy these days to write long treatises about my plans for the
schools.

What plan do I have?  Frankly, just good intentions.  However, we do
have districts in the area that have been successful at doing limiting
M$oft's influence and we could use them as a model.  (Perhaps stating
that I want to kick M$oft out was a bit too strong, but my point is to
introduce open source and limit our dependence on M$oft as a vendor.)

I guess my main response at this point is: how many other candidates for
school board have posted here and shown their willingness to be
open-minded about using open source in the Portland Public Schools.  If
you really want this to happen, you have someone who has worked on open
source systems, uses them daily, and is looking for new ideas to save
money.  If you want to part of the solution and not part of the problem,
perhaps you could assist in my efforts by posting your ideas how to
approach this.  I would be more than happy to hear your thoughts on this
(or any other issue).

I agree with your above statements, but the person who started this
thread is trying to get elected and to make a statement such as "Kick
Microsoft out of our schools" isn't going to gain points with many
people outside of the Open Source community.  If you campaign with a
strategy to include other solutions rather than remove what is familiar,
you might have better luck with the election.

My original reply was more political than operational.  
Once elected, I completely support Jon pushing Open Source as far as it
will go.  I was just giving my opinion and experience as to what I have
seen.  I have several local private schools as clients and trying to
force Open Source software didn't fly well there.  We were able to
convince them to implement portions at a time.  It is a start and
hopefully we will be able to add more as time goes by and the school
becomes more familiar and comfortable with it.

Again, we have to get another product other than MS products in the
school for your above statement to be correct.  Jon has a goal of doing
this.  I was just giving my opinion how he can help himself get elected
so he can accomplish this goal.  Why scare off potential voters.
Realize what their comfort point is and go from there.

IT workers have traditionally been considered "white collar" and no unions
have existed.

Today, however, with so many telephone, on-line and floor technicians,
there is definitely a place for organizing among the laborers.  (It
certainly would have helped alleviate the problems of the dot bust when
senior technicians were laid off in favor of cheaper labor.)

I think SAGE had the potential to be a fantastic tradesman's guild, but
has since given up any such aspirations.  The closest they come to
collective bargaining and setting professional standards is a salary
survey and newsletter.  Pretty weak.

As we continue our race to the bottom, we'll see more and more need for
organization among the working classes (whether we see more organization
or not).

I've considered working to organize groups such as the NOC technicians of
the various telcos and data carriers (often, in my experience, as highly
skilled as the engineers they support but having less formal education and
uniformly lower pay).  I've been unable to do anything of the sort because
I've had to try to find ways to support myself and there's no money in
organizing.  (Of course, that's the great strength of the system:  It
forces us to concentrate on our own survival individually to prevent us
from working toward our own propserity collectively.)  If there were a
sponsoring union, it might be possible to get a paid organizer into some
of the shops and make some change.  Unfortunately, as you point out, many
of the unions today are weak and many others have degraded into purely
capitalist organizations that exploit their own members for the profit of
the management.

I can't speak for Derek, but this is exactly what I get to do when I use

  Actually, they should be teaching students how to write and work with
numbers. When I was teaching at the university level -- upper-division
ecosystem courses -- I found students could not string together two coherent
thoughts. I also received three-sentence essays. Even now I find more
innumerate people than otherwise ("A half-gallon? Is that like .5?").

Message-ID: <20030502203338.GA2021@silver.CS.ORST.EDU>

I recently upgraded laptops, so I'm not using my picturebook anymore,
and would like to sell it (I'm posting to the LUGs because it is
running debian, and I don't want to install Windows on it.)

The specs are:

Sony Vaio pcg-c1x

This is what it looks like:
http://www.reviewsonline.com/images/article/sny99a12a.jpg

P-266, 128mb, 4.3gig, pcmcia nic., 56k internal hardware modem,
soundblaster compatible audio, integrated camera, external usb flopppy
drive, firewire.

The battery is good for about 45min. and it runs a gui in 1024x480
(note the small formfactor, and odd resolution).

Last I checked, these were going for $500 or so on ebay, I'd like to
get $300-$350 for it. Currently it's running debian stable (woody),
and I don't really want to install windows on it just to sell it on
ebay.

I haven't been able to get the camera to work in linux, and I've not
bothered with the modem, or the firewire. Everything else works great,
and it actually has three mouse buttons (the pointing device is one of
thoes points in the center of the keyboard).

Powermanagement is done with APM, which works flawlessly.

If you are interested email me off list.

If you don't have any plan on promoting Linux in the public schools,
why don't you ask possible solutions from the PLUG members?
Whoever is interested might send you his/her proposals off the list 
and then you can compile feasible solutions into one detailed plan.

Message-ID: <200305021133.21327.pundit@teleport.com>

Here are the State Senators (mentioned in my talk last night) that 
Rep. Barnhart's office would like constituents to contact re:  
Open Source bill (HB 2892):

Ginny Burdick (Tigard to Hillsdale)
Richard Devlin  (Lake Oswego to Wilsonville)
Ryan Deckert  (Beaverton)
Charlie Ringo (Sunset corridor)

You can find maps of their districts by clicking here -- 

http://www.leg.state.or.us/senate/senateset.htm

-- and then following the link through each legislator to zir "Web 
Page Address."  On each legislator's web page is a sidebar 
containing a link to a district map.  Except Charlie Ringo.  His 
webpage is broken.

I don't know why Barnhart's office wants these particular senators 
targeted.  It seems to me that at this point any Democratic 
senator would be a good choice.

Anyway, here's the message that Sally (in Barnhart's office) wants 
delivered: "There's a bill stuck in the House.  Is there any way 
we can get some help | support from the Senate?"

And the soundbite, if you can work it in:  "We need to support 
Oregon jobs, not out-of-state corporations."

I had a good time last night.  Thank you all for the opportunity 
to speak.

This guy was paying attention to what happened here in Oregon, and 
has dealt with it very effectively!

I knew that our Open Source bill here was not likely to pass.  I 
also knew that it would draw our opposition out into the open 
where their techniques could be analyzed -- making the next 
battle easier to win for someone else.

Stanco has done an EXCELLENT job of analyzing the FUD that our 
opponents offered in committee testimony against the Oregon Open 
Source bill, and countering it directly.  Congrats to him.

If only it were possible to turn back the clock here in Oregon and 
include his testimony (above) here....

The way Mr. Barber puts this reminds me of an analysis I once read about 
organized crime at the turn of the century (last one, not this one). A few 
"clean" politicians would listen to reason and try to create legislation to 
clean up their act while the rest secretly pocketed large amounts of money 
and, for a long while, nothing changed.

The scene is different but the actions are the same. 

I guess we could take a look at history and see how, in the face of large 
dollars lobbying politicians towards "the dark side", a grass-roots movement 
can change the law. In the past this took the face of a heavy media campaign, 
letting people know what was happening. This involved some heavy-duty 
journalism, getting to the source, finding who was taking money (and why) and 
letting people know the reasons behind why their politicians did not vote to 
outlaw organized crime. The problem being that taking money is very 
commonplace today (and people are so "over-media"ed that they will not listen 
unless something is particularly seedy or interesting.) Our politicians and 
leaders can take "contributions" and be "forced" to "listen" to corporations 
(like Microsoft). People don't care because they are not that interested in 
what their computers run. People see Microsoft as a great corporation that 
contributes money to schools and non-profits.

Perhaps this bill is "too much, too soon". It is also reminiscent of the 
marijuana legalization bills that, inevitably, will be on the ballot every 
other year. Peoples opinions are too closed. They don't know what this bill 
means. They don't know what open source software is. They know Windoze, 
because they use it at work (and at home on their crappy PC they bought at 
best buy or the home shopping network) and they feel threatened by something 
they don't know, and don't understand. 

I guess what I'm getting at is that part of the reason this billed failed is 
not just Mircosoft's intervention (we all know that is the REAL reason). Our 
government is currently organized to give a bigger voice to the corporate 
influence. Whether this is right or not, it is LEGAL and the strategy of open 
source must act accordingly..

That said, does anyone have any ideas on how to combat having a neighbor like 
M$ next door? No matter what the legislation, they are close enough that they 
will interfere with almost anything that goes on in our capitol. We will 
always have to deal with weak politicians and deep pockets of M$ lobbying. 
How can we get around this? How do you convince people that a big company 
that they may not like (though secretly admire and envy) is bad news when it 
comes to the bottom line?

Hi all,
While Reading the Plug list today Norton discovered a Virus on my
machine. Yes, it's a win98 box, No, I don't know how it got here.
I had just finished changing some shares on the box so my network here
could function a little freer. I writing to let you know it is
something you might want to check your system for.

It's called the W32/Opaserv-a virus on Sophos.
(www.sophos.com/virusinfo/analyses/w32opaserva.html)

it uses an ip vulnerability to computers with open  c: shares and
netbios enabled.

Not hard to get rid of if you catch it early.

Norton caught it and alerted me and I was able to go to Google and
find the fix.

I'm passing this on so you can be made aware that it's in the portland
area, that anyone connected to the Internet can get it(well, it
doesn't work on Linux or Mac's) and that even those of us who should
know better( Mea  Maxima Culpa)  can fall to this one while doing
things we take for granted should be safe.
 
So, thanks for reading, I now return you to the discussion on how best
to fillet and cook a politician.

We can use his testimony, only in the NEXT go round.
We can lose a battle and not lose the war. Oregon was just the opening
Skirmish in what is going to be the "Mother of all Battles" in the
Computer world. Yes, we took some licks here. But we still have the
better weapons. We must fight in the style that can beat down the
opposition. Consider ourselves as Guerilla fighters. We work quietly
at converting the masses to our way of thinking by working alongside
them and showing them the benefits and cost savings of using Open
Source Software. We fight for one little hamlet at a time. When we are
attacked, we fade into the jungle and come up somewhere else to
provoke and fight.
 
In the  night, we go directly against the opposition and develop tools
and programs and hardware that work, not just as good, but better.
It may take years, we must face the fact that we cannot take them on
dollar for dollar, our base of power against them doesn't have it. But
we can win, by winning the hearts and minds of users, of small
businesses and local school districts. 

We take it to those places the opposition considers to small and
menial to deal with. We do it by building LUGS in every city, county
and state. Slowly, one at a time, if necessary. We shall prevail. We
shall be the opening wedge that will change how corporate America and
the world does business.
We do not oppose profit, we support it, but just not on the backs of
our users and not out of the pockets of our tax payers and citizens
and school districts.

Every person, teenager, student and Little Old Lady we can convert to
Open Source, becomes a warrior in our cause. As one against the Giant
we are lost, but organized together, there is no army of "legal
Experts" ,"Corporate Software Bullies", there is no enemy we cannot
take on and win. 

I believe in the words of the American Hero, Benjamin Franklin, who
said as he signed the Declaration of Independence:

" If we do not hang together, then we shall surely hang separately"

We need to use the same tactics the Revolutionary Warriors did. To
fire our shots at the enemy and to fade into the trees. Let "them"
fight in regimented rows in bright uniforms and with their "tried and
true" weapons and tactics. While we use our wits and our connections
to the people. Let us use the disgruntled user who is tired of
re-booting his computer to fix an error that comes installed as a
"Feature"

When we took up the cause of Open Source Software, we did so in the
full knowledge that it was an uphill fight. Let us not lose that
courage of our convictions because one setback has slowed the pace of
the battle locally. Now, is the time to regroup and to develop our
plans for the next battle.
Now is the time to organize and subvert those who would be hinge
points in our battle.
Politicians who oppose us, must be removed. Legal rulings against us
must be fought against. And we must use whatever weapons fall to our
hands, whether they are ethical or not, for we are engaged in a war
that will change history more than the battles in the Middle East
will. We must take our fight to the People, let the People decide who
is the better for them. But we must also enlighten and teach the
people, so they realize they HAVE an alternative.

Let each of us create a "Cell" that trains, just three people, and in
exchange, those three teach three more and form another cell. Let that
be the COST we incur, so that our posterity may live in a better
place, perhaps, than where we are now. Let us fight for the future,
rather than the present. Let our vision be one that is FAR sighted
rather than so near-sighted we lose the scope of the battle.

The People of the World are looking to us to start that process that
will free them from the tyranny they now struggle against. Let us have
hope in ourselves, so that we can give hope to those who cannot join
us at the barricades.Let us not waiver from our goals nor let us lose
hope that we shall prevail.For those without hope are dead already and
those who fight on have no use for the dead. Let us give that last
ounce, that last full measure to our cause. For in the end, whether we
succeed this year or next or the years after, those who follow us in
the fight need our resolve to help them conquer, even if we ourselves
should fall. Let us therefore resolve to commit all our energy and
passion to this, our cause. I know not what the future will bring, but
I stand ready to defend my beliefs, even to the fires of Hell.


Thank you for taking the time to read this,
Harry Howard

A voice of reason.  It is interesting how few people know, understand,
and can use high school mathematics; things like algebra, the Pythagorean
Theorem, and simple right triangle trigonometry.  No wonder so many people
misunderstand and miss use more advanced mathematics, like probability and
statistics.

Student essays can be interesting, especially when they aren't written for
an english class.  It seems that many students don't believe the rules
of writing apply outside of english classes.

On the other hand, we Americans are pretty literate and well educated.
I complain about our educational system, but it works pretty well.

If I recall correctly I am just barely within district 25 which is John
Minnis district. Does anyone have more detail about his opposition to this
bill as I am planning to send a letter to him once I confirm that I am in
District 25, I can't seem to find my voters card to verify this right now. I
would like to do my research before writing a letter, so additional
information/links about both the bill and what Minnis is doing would be
appreciated.

The success of state lottery is an example of a failure of our education 
system to teach mathematics.  Someone once said that gambling was a tax on
those who flunked math.

Subject: [PLUG] Sharing a modem
Message-ID: <20030503145259.GA10090@boora.com>

My wife is moving her company and needs to use a modem to connect to the
internet until her DSL is installed.  They are all Win98/95 machines.
Someone told her that she could set up a Win2000 machine as a phone
server.  Then:
Me:  "You should use a linux box"
Her: "A linux box!!  Can you set that up for me?"
Me:  "Well, err, I, um , well......"

My experience is limited to my home network using DSL and an IP
masquerading firewall.  Ridiculously easy.  Could I employ the same
technique with a dial up modem?  How to set that up (I'll use Debian,
probably Knoppix)?  I think once I got going I'd be OK.  What
application is used to dial up?  How will it automatically dial when
accessed by a client on their network?  Can it be shared ala a DSL/NIC
style setup?

Thanks a lot.

  Until we installed dsl almost four years ago we shared a modem among all
machines and it would dial and connect whenever someone went to fetch a Web
page, do a ftp transfer or when fetchmail went to get mail from the ISP. So,
the answer is, "Yes".

  I _thought_ there was a daemon called, "diald", but I cannot find it on my
system. However, there's a PPP-HOWTO and you'll want to read 'man pppd' and
'man wvdial'.

  When you have specific questions someone more knowledgeable than I will
answer them for you.

Yes.  The masquerading setup will be the same as if your upstream IP
connection is a DSL line.  The masquerading software doesn't care, just so
long as you have a place for it to send its IP packets.

Look in the pppd documentation for the "demand" configuration option.  It
will probably be easiest to get pppd working without this option first,
then enable it once you're sure the modem and ISP login are both working
properly.

This somewhat outdated document may also be useful:

Yes.  Though obviously it will be quite slow in comparison.

I thought he made some interesting points.  However, it did leave me
wondering about several things.

1) How pervasive is OSS in the State offices?  He never gave details
about how many servers, desktops, or whatever run OSS versus those that
don't.

2) He is an assistant sys admin, and therefore may not have an eagle eye
view of all systems.  With this in mind, he states it may cost more
money to mandate something that many sys admins already do.  If they do
use OSS, this is a good point; however, since he never explains how
pervasive OSS is in the State government, we never get a clear picture
of how much would be spent vesus how much would be saved.

3) Finally, he states that the definition of OSS that the bill provides
is very "restrictive".  Is this true?  I have not seen the definition of
OSS provided in the bill.

Basically, his overall argument is "let the admins decide".  Not really
a bad argument, however the role of government is to make policy and
part of this policy is to run efficiently.  Those who advocate OSS want
the State to make policy that is uniform and clear.  If all admins do
what they want without direction, we would be left with systems that do
not work in concert and are very inefficent.  So, I am somewhat
sympathetic toward the idea of input from the admin, but to advocate no
policy on the matter leaves the State wasting money where they could
actually be saving it.

Just some thoughts, for what its worth.

Well, among other things one of the problems with his letter is 
that most of the stuff he objected to in the bill has already 
been removed in negotiations with his bosses -- the CTO and 
Deputy CIO of the State of Oregon.

I am a little unclear where they got this guy.  Did he _really_ just
respond yesterday?  It seems like at least a possibility they had his
"response" in the can before they ran Ken's OpEd.  If so, where did
they find him?  Was he "offered" by "the other side"?

I thought most of his argument whiffed (as in: "a swing and a miss"),
however, from a public relations point of view it might have done its
job.  The public doesn't understand the complexities, sees two
opposing points of view and can't evaluate them well enough to form an
accurate judgement.

>From what I was able to dig up on him: his full name is Raymond L.
Robert and he currently works at the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners
(I'd guess since about 2000).  He has posted from a currently defunct
address associated with a company called "Three Star Software, Inc.",
between about August 1997 and April 2000.  He seems to work with HPUX,
judging by where he posts.  He also apparently has posted on the
C.R.I.M.E. list, though in the public archive I found, his email was
obscured.  The website at his agency is running Apache 1.3.27 on
Solaris.

He's a member of one of Ed Sawicki's groups (PANUG/BIZNIX) and has 
been a royal PITA from the time news of this bill first emerged 
on the PANUG/BIZNIX mailing list, whining about all the extra 
work it will cost to do a little research into OSS as well as 
whining about other things (such as his pitiful salary at the 
State of Oregon).

He also posted some negative remarks on ... some blog, maybe 
Slashdot but I don't remember.  There have been numerous private 
emails between him, me and Rep. Barnhart.

In the beginning he was marginally helpful but his attitude has 
steadily deteriorated.  Almost seems to have some emotional 
stability problems....  My guess is that he's been watching this 
thing all along and simply got so mad at yesterday's op-ed that 
he threw together a response during his lunch hour at work.

Anyway, anyone care to respond publically (i.e., in a letter to 
the editor) to anything he's said?

Theses numbers are available on a department level. For example, DAS
will be able to tell you what they have but is not likely to have the
numbers for DHS. 

I can tell you that our department has several Linux boxes running OSS.
I can also tell you that the largest platform in my department contains
an engine that is dedicated to Linux. This engine has the capacity of
running a maximum of 30000 Linux servers and there is documented
evidence of like platforms, in other states, running 8000+ Linux
production servers (see oss.software.ibm.com/linux390). Our first
opportunity, if successful, will replace roughly 300 workstations with
OSS clients. All of this has the blessing of state IS and Business
management. Production CVS and other infrastructure service requests are
coming in rapidly.

I am a Senior Systems Admin with the state and I don't look at what unit
has which OS. We tend to look at what fits best for the business need
and deploy that OS and app. Also, I know of no "Eagle" that watches over
all departments and counts what OS or Application is installed and
compares the numbers (this is not to say that an "Eagle" does not
exist). The state departments and agencies are big on working standards
that they can maintain and manage. Finding the number of devices using
"Standard A" and those using "Standard B" should, I guess, be possible
although, considering the volume, this would be a daunting and expensive
task.

It would be interesting to see what the bill ended up looking like after
amendment. Is there a link to the finished bill?

Let the admins decide is not going to make it here. The task is actually
to prove that an OSS solution works, is manageable, stable and cost
effective. The task then shifts to selling the solution to the business
units that have to use the product in their daily operation. All of this
is about the same as it is in private sector corporations.

I was thinking about sending a response, but with my track record on these
kinds of things, don't let my expression of intent stop anyone.

What I found interesting was that he evaded the issue that the bill was
being stopped not due to the technical reasons he mentions, but because
a lobbyist (obviously working on behalf of Microsoft) wanted it dead &
buried. In other words, his point is that this bill should be debated,
when the issue is that Craven does not want anyone inside government
(& perhaps even outside of it) to have the debate.

BTW, Ken I submitted the link to your letter in the Oregonian to both
Slashdot & Linuxtoday. Despite my pitch (& I thought it was a decent one),
/. passed on it, while Linuxtoday featured it today. Perhaps /. was
too busy looking for stories to post duplicates of.

A FUD captain!

Out of curiousity, I had my girlfriend read this (who only slightly knows the 
underlying battle between open source and $$). She said he made some very 
convincing arguments, but did not back up anything with fact. This is a media 
tactic I recently read Noam Chomsky talking about - concision. The media 
people use concision to reduce utterly complex arguments into "feel-good 
sound bites". There is NO fact and NO real defenses for the arguments he is 
making, but it sure does sound good.

> Anyway, anyone care to respond publically (i.e., in a letter to

I'm not so sure a response to this is necessary, other than normal submissions 
to the editor that state a pro opinion to OSS and bills like hb2892. By 
responding to this man directly it will not only legitimize his opinion but 
also legitimize his feelings of disgruntlement.

This statement seems to imply that PANUG is "my" group.
It is not. It is run by a Board of Directors and I'm
not on it. I'm just a worker bee there and frequent
contributor to it's email-delivered newsletter.

BizNix is different. I'm the founder and there is no
Board of Directors. So, it's like PLUG. I'm to BizNix
as David Mandel is to PLUG.

Ray Robert is a member of both groups if I recall
correctly, and his opinions may differ from those of
typical Linux enthusiasts, but I know him to be a man
of high scruples.

<snip>

I've been an observer to the debates and differences
of opinion between Ken and Ray in the recent past. I
think one of the primary reasons for this conflict is
their dramatically different experiences with State
government. Ken was fired from a State job because he
advocated keeping an existing OSS system in place that
was reliable and doing the job. His manager fired him
because he didn't agree that the system should be
scrapped and replaced with a Microsoft-only system.

While I don't know for sure, I suspect that this has
never happened to Ray because he works for a State
agency where common sense prevails much or most of
the time.

My experiences outside of State government more
closely match Ken's experiences. I've lost lots of
work because customers want to go with Microsoft
solutions even when they're the worst of all solutions.
The playing field is horribly uneven because of the
mass bias toward Microsoft products in spite of the
high cost and the frequent problems. 

I think HB2892 is needed because we need the
equivalent of an affirmative action program for
software in order to level the playing field, Clearly,
when you talk about affirmative action many people
are not going to agree because it causes them some
inconvenience and is perceived as reverse discrimination.
However, that's the price we all pay when we're trying
to repair problems brought about by years of abuse by
those in power.

One such abuse was the Republican-controlled Federal
government letting Microsoft escape the punishment for
crimes they were convicted of and allowing them to
continue committing these crimes. 

When our Federal government lets us down, our State
governments could step in with a partial remedy but
even a highly diluted remedy (HR2892) was killed -
also by a Republican.

It pisses me off but I still respect Ray's opinion.

Well I'd strongly suggest an Asante (or other company's) hardware firewall
verses trying to knock something together.  For around $120 (a year ago
price) you can have a decent firewall in place that will work with a
modem or Ethernet connection.
   I ran a diald based system for years and built several for companies
and churches before the advent of inexpensive firewalls.  Then about a
year ago I started having problems with my internal modem so decided to go
with an external which worked fine but I wanted a more commercial touch to
my home setup (which I use to demostrate what can be done) so I bought an
Asante (with serial port).  I had it up and working within 30 minutes
which included _reading_ the installation guide (very MS oriented) and the
UNIX network portion of the manual.
   I now have DSL but the modem is still connected to the firewall (which
is behind my DSL bridge/router) just incase the DSL (SDSL - not shared
line) circuit goes down.  I can reconfigure to use the modem in about 5
minutes.

Kind of goes against the grain to use something not Linux but I'm
pragmative about these things.  I use Microsoft products until I can find
an easy or decent Open Source/Linux solution.

There are many Republicans who don't agree with this bill going down.
Still, what will do mroe is repairing the educational system so that 
tomorrow's IT people are better able to use OSS or any non Microsoft
option for that matter.  A very rel problem is that open source is politically
incorrect where making Republicans out to be open source enemies is
only going to make it more politically incorrect.  The question of open
source needs to be depoliticized and made to stand on arguments of
fact.  The best argument I've heard was that the software industry was
competitive before the 80's.  The democrats in this state are not saints,
they gave us doctor assisted suicide, abortion, and Kulongoski.

My message was posted to this list, which is not read by
the general public so I don't think my comments are going
to antagonize Republicans everywhere. 

Facts are facts. In all major battles between corporate 
monopolists and the U.S. government (DOJ and FTC) that
I've paid attention to, it was a Republican administration
that dropped the case, or forgave the crime in some way.
One of the more obvious examples in the computer industry
is IBM (Ronald Regan administration), where the case was
dropped. Now Microsoft (Bush administration), where the
company was convicted but was not punished for the crime.

I don't agree that it should be depoliticized. This is
all about the politics of big business, special interests,
and the politicians that allow corruption to flourish.
Many of us here know that "arguments of fact" don't work
and some of us here have lost our jobs or significant
amounts of work because of this issue.   

This is not the forum for suicide and abortion issues and
they have nothing to do with computer industry monopolies.
Please let's not go off on that tangent.

The 13-year investigation, which required IBM to retain 200 attorneys at one
point, fizzled in the early '80s as the computing landscape shifted from
mainframes to personal computers. The government abandoned the tainted effort
entirely in 1982, as clones of the IBM PC eroded Big Blue's dominance.

What do clones of the PC have to do with anything when,
as you say, the investigation was on-going for 13 years?
Do you think the DOJ dropped the case just because IBM
had competition in one market segment that was
insignificant to IBM at the time?

Will some future historian claim that Microsoft was
forgiven their crimes because their X-Box did not do
well?

She was elevated to the Federal District Court in 1997 by President Clinton,
and today she was widely praised for being evenhanded and diligent.

http://www.hagley.lib.de.us/1980.htm
the case was withdrawn by William F. Baxter, assistant attorney general in
charge of the Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, on January 8, 1982.
Baxter signed a Stipulation of Dismissal that stated the government's charges
were "without merit." It was later discovered that Baxter had failed to
disclose that he had been retained as a consultant to a West Coast law firm
defending IBM in private antitrust cases. 

http://www.stanford.edu/dept/facultysenate/archive/1999_2000/reports/106339/106

But the high point of Bill's career was unquestionably the Bell System
divestiture, comparable only to the breakup of the Standard Oil Company of New
Jersey in 1911. His position was controversial even within the Administration,
being strongly opposed by among others the Secretary of Defense, who rather
outranked him. But its benefits for consumers and for the competitiveness of
the US telecommunications industry have been widely praised by economists, and
in 1996 he was a co-recipient of the John Sherman Award, for his "vision and
courage".

They are more important issues than computer science to many
and therefore I cannot in good conscience ever vote for a democrat
regardless what he or she will do about the techology issues facing
our world today.  This legislation failed because it isn't clear that
it doesn't cover laws that already exist where it is politically unwise
to set it up as a victory for one political party in a dived state and
nation.  Where does this measure stop Microsoft from exerting 
blackmail pressure on schools if they decide to go with Microsoft
anyways and for that matter how does this measure address the
problem of new versions of Windows not wanting to cohabit with
other operating systems?  Political slander is wrong, it shows just
how liberal and closed minded some Portlanders have become.

As far as the claims that people don't care about what operating system
they run, who on this list has gone out and asked the question of enough
individuals to substantiate that?  Is the problem that the state isn't forced
to research open source or is the problem that not enough has been done
to build a market for open source support services and products that
operate on top of open source?  Why can companies spend the time to
write proprietary software for Linux yet they can't find the time to do it for
MacOSX or any other platform?  A measure needs to be proprosed to
address the legitimate needs of business and labor where the two sides
need to be reconciled.  If any measure is needed it needs to be for all the
people and not just one political party.

I don't know, perhaps we should ask Oracle, SAP, IBM, Macromedia, Computer

So after a bit of messing around I got Mailman working.  However I seemed
to find an apparent lack of direction with regards to what mm_cfg.py
should contain, despite googling and www.list.org.  Plenty of faqs and
performance tuning info, and I followed somewhat the example in
Defaults.py.  Am wondering if there aren't any handy links that Pluggers
have saved.
Does anyone have Mailman references they have found useful & would like to
share?

On another note, it seems that Mailman generates errors when I create a
new list and it apparently(?) tries to update my /etc/postfix/aliases file
on it's own.  It's not hard for me to do so for it but if that's a common
problem I'd welcome advice.

Thanks

Hey, I am gambling too. Always looking to find a lottery ticket on the

the big one. The statistical advantage of buying the ticket versus
trying to find one is neglectable.

    The success of state lottery is an example of a failure of our education

In Washington State there is Washtech a local of CWA.  I would certainly
be interested in an Oregon local with a similar focus.

The point is that this is a technical list, not a political list. If I
want political topics, I'll look up various former and present members
of this list and invite them to plug-talk.

This is already too far off topic to continue.

Subject: (uswisp) Senate Bill 905 needs to be amended
Date: 03 May 2003 09:40:32 -0600

S.905 : A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 to provide a broadband Internet access tax
credit. Sponsor: Sen Rockefeller, Jay [WV] (introduced
4/11/2003), Senate, 5/2/2003,
http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:s.00905:

This bill does NOT extend the tax credits to ISPs.  The language in the 
bill currently limits those eligible for the tax credit to:

  (A) cable operator,
  (B) commercial mobile service carrier,
  (C) open video system operator,
  (F) other wireless carrier,

  providing current generation broadband services or
  next generation broadband services to subscribers
  through such qualified equipment."

This essentially means that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are NOT 
eligible for the tax credit unless they are also "carriers" or cable 
companies.  The word "carrier" is specifically defined under federal law 
and NM state law to mean a business certified under the FCC or state Public 
Regulation Commission.  In other words, a phone company, whether a regular 
phone company such as Qwest or Valor, or a wireless phone company such as 
Verizon or Alltel.

ISPs who provide their own DSL, wireless services, or other broadband 
services will not get the tax credits.

The bill is currently in the Senate Finance Committee.

The members of the Senate Finance Committee are:

Republicans:

Nine of the 21 members are from our own Qwest-served states.

I urge you all to contact your own congressional delegates ( 
http://www.senate.gov/ and select your state) and/or members of the Senate 
Finance Committee to have this bill amended to include ISPs who also 
provide broadband services, whether they are carriers or not.

You might choose to point out that when the state-based ISPs, who are 
usually in competition with the phone companies and cable companies, fail 
because these big companies get huge federal tax credits but the local ISPs 
do not - that the money and jobs that the state-based ISPs contributed to 
the state economies usually go out of state.

If there is a state association that can also write a letter - that helps also.

Forward as you feel appropriate.

Thanks,

Marianne

Subject: [PLUG] Vanilla 2.4.20 kernel compilation fails??!!
Message-ID: <03050506540900.22108@gate>

Hello Linux folkz.
I updated my existing Linux SuSE 8.1 to 8.2 version.
Everything went very smoothly.
However, when I tried to recompile plain vanilla 2.4.20 kernel from
kernel.org, the compilation proceeded with a bunch of warnings like:

warning: comparison between signed and unsigned

and after a while it abruptly exited with errors.
Interesting thing is that prior to this I recompiled and installed MySQL
4.0.12 DB from its sources from mysql.com without any problems.
Could somebody please help me or give a hint how to solve this problem.
I've noticed, that SuSE8.2 has a newer version of gcc 3.3.
Could it be the case why kernel compilation fails?
If it so, what should be changed in makefile for kernel 2.4.20?
Thank you very much in advance for any help or hints.
Alex

Why are you going to a line number?  Are you looking at error
messages?  If so, run that same command under M-x compile CR, and the
line numbers are automatically located for you!  See "running compilations
under emacs" in the info file for details.

But when I do something outside that, I have just learned to type M-x
got TAB CR to get to "goto-line" quickly.

Set the region around the whole thing, then M-x indent-region CR.  Usually
works.

I have:

(global-set-key [f5]   'goto-line)

(To give credit where it's due, I sort of remember stealing this from
Terry Griffin eons ago.)

And if you're working through compile errors, well then, there's:

(global-set-key [f6]   'next-error)

  Because I'm working with text files, especially those exported from OO.o.
Someone compiles the ideas but the interpretation is up to the reader.

So quickly, is emacs better than vim?  I've learned some
tricks such as multiple windows and have seen versions of vim
that syntax highlight C code so I'm really starting to wonder just
how different these two editors are.  Are the colors used for syntax
highlighting under the editors the same as the ls colors?  I want to
change the black background and colorization choices for the
terminal and ls becuase the color don't show up well to my liking.
Blue does not come out on black.

  No. They are different.

 AFAIK, both can be used for just about any editing/writing/coding task. In
my -- admittedly limited -- experience, vi(m) tends to be the editor of
choice of SysAdmins because it's small and fast (because of a gazillion
keyboard shortcuts for _everything_). Emacs has been described as the editor
with everything -- including the kitchen sink. As a result, it is quite
large (emacs == Eight Megs And Counting Still) but it can be used as the
shell for your console sessions.

  Both support color and syntax highlighting.

  My copy of emacs used to come up with a white background and black/colored
text on it. I find that too contrasty for comfortable viewing so I changed
everything in ~/.emacs to produce a black background with the colors I want
on it.

  Works for me.

Try 

set background=dark

in vi (you can put this line in your ~/.vimrc if you want it to always
do that).

For emacs, the options menu offers a good interface to changing your
font colors (and all other emacs settings). In emacs-speak, fonts are
called faces, iirc.

Message-ID: <200305051747.h45Hl3j22560@gate.daniloff.com>

Hello Linux folkz,
I've got an issue with plain kernel 2.4.20
compilation using gcc-3.3 (Pre-release)
which came as default gcc with my SuSE 8.2.
I couldn't find solution to the problem
when kernel compilation terminates with 
warnings.
Is there any chance to downgrade or upgrade
gcc-3.3 to more stable version without sacrifying
system integrity?
Or could somebody please give me a hint what patch,
option or other thing should be done to the plain
vanilla kernel 2.4.20 in order to compile it correctly
with existing gcc-3.3?

Thank you in advance for any help.

Alex

Or,

  :colorscheme elflord

Take a spin through /usr/share/vim/*/colors/. There are a bunch of 
different color schemes you can use, many of which will override your 
terminal's default background color/image.

That could start a month-long thread.

Let me summarize the results of that thread:

After losing a massive Excel spreadsheet several times when doing the same
thing, I now rely exclusively on external versioning systems.

Maybe OpenOffice emulated Excel TOO well this time.

Jason,

  Emacs runs in either console mode or an virtual terminal; I have it start
in its own window in X. Yes, it's all text. You can write code, compile and
debug from within it. I know nothing about xemacs; it's a different animal
than is emacs. I've no idea what UI emacs uses, but I suspect that it's its
own UI written in elisp.

/* warning: what follows is intended to be funny, and will probably get
me in deep trouble. */

You know, I got this far and expected that this would be a fair and
honest description of an emacs-vim flamewar. Which seemed so nice of
someone as intelligent as Mr. Schwartz to shortcut the actual flamewar
and provide.

> * the other camp are simple folk, who would probably prefer that we all

But then this came along, and I realized that rather than summarizing
the flamewar, Mr. Schwartz was rather beginning it.

So with the first volley on his side, let me answer with this:

I can load Vim in less than ~2 seconds on my very very old machines. It
takes about, oh, 30 minutes for emacs.

And then, when I make a simple mistake and close emacs instead of the
window I was working on, I curse and scream.

> :-)

And while we're on the subject of flamewars, let me restate your email
with regards to another common flamewar:

Perl vs. Python summary:

* There'd be lots of posts. Terrifying numbers of posts, mostly
pro-perl, but the perl ones would be short and ugly, while the python
ones would be long, clean, well-written theses regarding the worth of a
language in terms of its elegance.

* Two camps. 

* One camp loves the fact that they can write clean, easily readable and
maintainable code that they can come back to a month later and still
know what it does. They are constantly surprised by how elegant and
natural the language is. For them, Python is the way to go, and dirty
hacks and ugliness are always the resort of the weak-minded.

* The other camp are neanderthals who grunt in short, semi-intelligible
spurts of random symbols. They like perl, for reasons that are entirely
unclear to me, and proudly show off its illegibility.

Jeff

(all in good fun, I swear...=)
(oh, and by the way, I use vim and emacs, perl and python, and sometimes
smalltalk and its variants.)

GNU-emacs runs in either text-mode or "x-mode".  At one point, GNU-emacs
had fallen behind the times and the x-mode was very functional, but
lacked features and was boring.  However, this has changed.
Thanks to competition from the xemacs people, the GNU-emacs people
got there act together and have greatly improved the x-mode.
As a result, GNU-emacs runs well in text-mode and in x-mode, and it
runs in these modes on most any Unix like OS and on most any MS Windows
OS.

xemacs runs in either text-mode or "x-mode".  At one point, xemacs
didn't run on Windows or barely worked on Windows.  However, this
has changed.  Current versions run well on any Unix like OS and on
most any MS Windows OS.

So, which is better GNU-Emacs or xemacs?  I don't know.  I generally
use GNU-Emacs, but this is simply because I started with GNU-Emacs
years and years ago.  I think GNU-Emacs may have a slight edge over
xemacs for high end sophisticated tasks, and xemacs may be a bit
easier to learn; but these differences are minor.  Internally, they
have some significant differences, but these don't really affect
most of us.  Indeed, I'm told that much of the emacs code I wrote
once upon a time works in xemacs, so ....

                                          Sincerely,

Why stop there? Let's pull 'em all out:

Actually, see, elisp declared bankruptcy and moved to brazil one step
ahead of the fraud investigators. Since then it's been having bazillions
of babies just to keep ahead of extradition (if you have a child under
17 by a brazilian, Brazil won't extradite you--a relative of mine did
this =). That's where we get Java, C++, C#, and the true bastard of them
all, JavaScript.

Of course Python moved back to the country, adopted a new name, and went
undercover, pretending to have no relation to any of them. In fact, it
got a gender change, and plenty of plastic surgery.

The real sad part is Perl, which isn't really anybody's child, being an
Argentine cowboy (gaucho) who ran away from the cows and ended up in
Brazil, tried to get itself adopted, and was rejected, so it went off
and joined the Paraguay (where they speak Spanish and the local
Amerindian tongue intertwined) and was elected mayor for its immediate
amalgamation of the local syntax with its own.

And let's just template them so that we can skip all the email
messages,  kind of like the old prison joke:

A man (not a Trail Blazer) is convicted of multiple assault and car
theft and sent to prison.  On the evening of his first day in, he hears
someone call out "37!".  The rest of the prison block just busts out
laughing.  Several more numbers are said with the same results, and
this continues for several minutes until the lights are turned off.

The next day he asks someone at lunch what the deal was with the
numbers last night.  The other inmate says, "Most of us have been in
here so long that we've just given each joke a number.  It saves the
time of actually telling it."

So the man figures out he'll give it a try tonight.  After they're
locked back in their cells after dinner he calls out, "45".  Dead
silence.  He tries another number, "71!".  Again, dead silence.
Baffled, he goes to sleep that night.

The next morning, he sits next to the same inmate who told him
about the joke/number system, "Hey, what happened last night with
my jokes?"

The other inmate says, "Hey, some people just can't tell a joke."

Hey Alex,
Are you getting a "segmentation fault" error during 2.4.20 compile and
actually doing a core dump, or is gcc failing on compile errors? 

The warnings that you mention earlier are probably fine, they usually
mean that a comparison is being done on a sub-routine return that might
be of type int instead of unsigned int. Normally looks something like

if (!someroutine(int somearg)){ do something fun; }

where somerouting() is of type int. This forces the compiler to complain
that, since ! is likely to be of type unsigned integer (in C this is the
case, C++ it's type bool) 0 or 1 and the return can be a negative
number. Really only possibly devastating to the programs operation in
this case but the compiler still complains but does not stop.

Can anyone tell me or direct me to a resource describing how to build a
Linux kernel that includes a new driver?

I had to build a new kernel to enable multi-LUN support for my tape
library.  I've discovered that my Dlink DGE-550T NIC locks up under high
load and I've downloaded the latest Linux driver from the Dlink website. 
So I've got the source code and a simple Makefile.  Now I just need to
know how to make it a part of a new kernel.
Thanks,
~M

It's best just to try it, but before you do, know these things:

Emacs has a _LOT_ of commands, so many of them are bound to multiple
keystrokes.

To exit: C-xC-c (this means pres Control-x, let up on the keys, then
press Control-c)

To save: C-xC-s (the case _does_ matter, C-xC-S saves all files currently open)

Meta(M) is usually Alt, or you can press Esc, let up on it, then type
the next character. ie: M-x can be run by pressing Esc, releasing it,
then pressing x. Because of this, you will often see Meta written as
Esc in documentation.

You might not need to recompile the kernel. Is module support enabled
for your current kernel? If so all you probably need to do is get the
module that you received from DLink in the right spot and make a change
to modules.conf. Also take a look at the insmod (and associated)
man-pages.

Who "loads" emacs?  I type "screen emacs" about once a month, to

xemacs has the advantage that it can include a "package" even if that
package's copyright has not been signed over to the FSF.  RMS refuses
to allow such a package into GNU Emacs.  While I understand RMS's
reason, it does tend to keep xemacs a bit more package-ful and
bleeding edge.  Not that you can't take most of the
non-GNU-Emacs-distro packages and try to run them on GNU Emacs anyway.
Most will work. :)

Just another guy who has written .el files that are in the core
of both versions of [x]emacs...

I don't use the redhat version of apt, so I can't answer this in
specific, but I can say that I've gotten signature errors before, and
they've never been because I got spoofed packages. I have to say, though
it's a huge security violation in theory, it's generally easiest and
perfectly safe to turn these checks off for the duration of the problem,
provided the same errors occur over the course of several days. It's
usually just a build error, that I've seen.

the message is supposed to tell you that the package failed to download,
was spoofed, or was overwritten at the source with a bad package. It's
probably a good security measure to keep in place, but it's never
happened in my memory.

I took a look at the provided driver at dlink.  Steve's advice would 
probably work to install that version.

I saw that the provided driver was 1.11 from May 23, 2002.
The driver in the 2.4.20 kernal is 1.12 from June 13, 2002.

Hi. My name Roger and I would like to get started in Linux. I have no 
experience, I have already picked up a copy of linux and am ready to run it.  
I have a computer print out from http://www.belarc.com/Download-auto.html 
about the nuts and bolts of my system. "Fujitsu laptop" I opted to get the 
corel linux software that is suppose to take alot of the guess work out of 
switching to linux. I basically created a boot disk for the cd and things 
were going well corel was loading fine and then starting was going fine and 
it beeped and the screen went of and on a few times like it was cycling? 
After 45 minutes the machine stopped. I turned it back on it went straight to 
the loading seemed straight forward but again after 45 minutes it turned off. 
 I tried for the third time no luck. I am trying to figure out why it will 
not load.  

Any help would be greatly appreciatted.  Rog

Didn't Corel discontinue their support for Linux.  Was this their distro
or their software?

Subject: [PLUG] IPTables
Message-ID: <3F09E1E6D02D804383502AFDC4DE4EC828E1@cp01.office.wa-net.com>

Hey all,

	I currently have running two linux boxes on the Internet both on
cable modem connections.  They both have their own internet connection
and are running NAT for their internal lan.  I decided I wanted to
connect a tunnel to them via GRE.  I know this isn't a secure connection
and it has issues with DHCP but with some creative solutions using
dyndns I've got the connections established.  I can ping end to end on
the network.

	Now, since I'm a gamer in my spare time and play Warcraft 3
somewhat, I want to be able to use the native lan support is has in the
game.  It finds games by sending UDP packets on port 6112 to
255.255.255.255.  My question is, how do I get my linux router to pick
that up with iptables, forward it to the other box, have the other box
then forward that to the local lan on its side.

I know this is confusing but It's before 9 o'clock so I'm allowed some
slack :)

Thank you,

Eric Brockman

Yes, thank you.  But what if I wanted to build a kernel without module
support, for security reasons, etc.?  How would I include that driver in a

I am guessing that the Corel distribution you are using is having
trouble recognizing the video card in the laptop when doing the X
configuration.

I suggest trying a bootable CD distribution like Knoppix that
you can download here 
http://www.knoppix.org/

If that works, you can install it permanently or move to some other
newer distribution that does work with your laptop.

You may want to see if your particular Fujistu is listed at 
http://www.linux-on-laptops.com

Other than that, what Bill wrote is good advice.  I'm not too keen to 
use Knoppix other than for diagnostics most of the time.  Going with a 
more current version is a good idea.  According to the publisher, Corel 
Linux for Dummies game out Jan 2000.  Meaning that if your laptop is 
newer than that (or even newer than '99) it probably wouldn't be a good 
Linux to try out due to HW issues.

Go with something newer.  You may be able to get through to Redhat now 
to download 9.  It makes a decent starter set.

Do you live in the Portland area?  If so, I'd recommend attending the
clinic on the 17th.  At the clinic you will have access to distribution
disks, as well as experts to help you with the install.
http://server.riverdale.k12.or.us/~danh/

In the meantime, playing around with Knoppix will help you get an idea
of what a Linux system is like.

I read about that.  Kind of a sketchy issue.  (Someone here lauded
xemacs as the competition GNU emacs needed to get its act together; yet
RMS thinks this competition is unfair and wants everyone working
together. . . .)

But what are these non-GNU packages?  Are they really cool, or are they
not so important?  I'm having a hard time seeing any real differences
between these two emacsen, from a user's perspective.

Specifically, though, I need code completion.  I don't know if anyone
here writes Java, but to me the most important plugin-type feature in a
Java IDE is one that scans all my source and any other .jars I use, and
gives me a list of members for the object at the cursor--and very
preferably one that can show me the Javadocs for each one as well. 
Anyone know if *emacs does that?

OK, I found a newer version of the dl2k.c (version 1.17) distributed with
the RH 9 2.4.20-9 kernel-source.  I copied the .c and .h files to their
correct location in the kernel source tree, built a new kernel with that
driver, and now I no longer have the lockups when transferring large
amounts of data over the network.  I'm still curious as to how you would
include a new driver that wasn't already listed in the "make menuconfig"
screens.  I assume there's a config file somewhere that you can point to
the new driver and add a description, etc.
Thanks,

Essentially it is a matter of copying the cd to the hard disk.
It is described in the Knoppix FAQ
http://download.linuxtag.org/knoppix/KNOPPIX-FAQ-EN.txt

I haven't tried this and therefore could not say whether
or not it is a good idea.

I haven't done this myself, but, at a minimum, you would have to:

Copy your source code to the appropriate directory.  In this case 
drivers/net/

Modify the Makefile in said directory.

Modify the Documentation/Configure.help file.

This may or may not be complete.  Why not try it and tell us how it goes.

JDEE (The Java Development Environment for Emacs) does that, iirc. I

Anybody care to respond to her claim that the only reason she 
killed the bill was because it was "a solution in search of a 
problem?"

Does anyone recall hearing that phrase before?  That's right -- 
it's straight out of the mouths -- word for word -- of the 
industry lobbyists who testified against the bill!

The best response to that statement that I've seen was written by 
Tony Stanco on Newsforge last week.  You may find it useful in 
crafting a reply:

http://newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=03/04/30/1926238&mode=thread&tid=19

Let's keep up the pressure.  If Minnis has chosen to respond to my 
piece out of all the dozens of issues she has to deal with every 
day, then I obviously got to her.

One question I would love to ask (but the Oregonian won't print 
two pieces from the same author in the same month) is, "If that 
is all it is -- a solution in search of a problem -- then why 
won't you let the House vote on it?  Do you not trust sixty 
legislators to figure that out for themselves?"

"I appreciate Barber's efforts to encourage state agencies to use
open-source software, and I share his desire to save money at all levels
of state government. However, state agencies already have the ability
under existing law to use open-source software." -Karen Minnis

So, the bill looks like it failed, and since the agencies have the
ability to use open source, maybe we should start a new approach.  Start
working with individual agencies to adopt new internal IT policies
encouraging the use of OSS.

I noticed that what she wrote was also factually incorrect.  She
denied a sequence of events that did, apparently, occur:

Minnis> This is not true.

However, my information is that:

 a) powerful out-of-state lobbyists showed up seeking to make the bill
    go away; and then

 b) Minnis kills the bill.

I suppose she could object to the implicit suggestion that the
lobbyists somehow, oh I don't know, maybe influenced her opinion or
something, but unless a) or b) is incorrect, then her denial as stated
is erroneous.

It seems to me that this is exactly what she wants you to do, because it
will be nearly impossible to get agencies to switch.  Why should they? 
They may be sympathetic with OSS but unless mandated to switch, I doubt
they will.  A few might, but not en masse.

I think you need to approach this from two fronts:

1) You need to stress that conservatives such as Minnis repeatedly talk
about reducing costs, but when push comes to shove they ignore an easy
solution.  A letter writing campaign to the Oregonian will be far more
effective than letters to her unless of course you are in her district.

2) Which leads me to the second front...... get anyone you know in her
district -- East County and Wood Village -- to write her.  This is where
the pressure will come from.

If you folks are serious about putting the pressure on her, you need to
start doing some grassroots work.  All the ideology and bantering back
and forth will mean nothing without political backing.  There are simple
things you can do if you have about a dozen people to start with --
phone calls, letter writing to voters, and door to door canvasing.  I am
afraid that unless you are willing to put in the work at the ground
level there will be no reason for her to change her mind.

It should be noted that Knoppix does not attempt to support your video
card for most video cards--rather, it uses the kernel framebuffer (vesa)
and makes it look good, but is not in fact recognizing the video card.
You can do what Knoppix does with corel by going to the command line and
typing

dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86

and using VESA and making sure you have your BUS:nn:nn:nn correct--look in
/proc/pci for the video card and read the numbers off there.

(yes, Corel is a debian distro--redhat configures X differently =)

But the Knoppix thing might be easier if you have no desire to play.

I have and can say that in general, it works. It does, however, take up
about 2.2 gigs of space and loads the machine with tons of stuff, which
isn't great for older machines, but is fine for newer ones.

basically here are the commands:

boot knoppix
ctrl-alt-f1 to get to the first virtual terminal
hit return a few times to get a command prompt
knx-hdinstall
follow directions
reboot
change the default language setting to english--it's
kontrolzentrum->personalische->land und sprache if I recall correctly,
check the Knoppix faq.

a notes: the installer is very beta--make a mistake, and you have to
cancel out and start over. It's also a bit funky on the keystrokes, but
not too bad.

I believe that kernel packages are skipped by default in up2date.  You can 
override this, but unless up2date can 'i'nstall instead of just 'f'reshen, 
don't do it this way.

Normally, I install the new kernel and reboot to make sure it works.  After 
you're sure the new kernel is okay, your can 'e'rase the previous one.  I 
haven't built a kernel in over a year and just use the binary rpm.  When I 
was building them, I used tarballs, so I can't advise on building RH's 
kernel-source rpm.

up2date has no problem updating kernel RPMs (it installs them, leaving
the old one(s) present and the old default is usually still the default
kernel).  yum also updates kernels automatically (and correctly), only
apt-get will not do it for you unless you remove the line from the
configuration file, and even then I'm not sure it will.  Usually you
have to tell apt the specific version you want to install with
# apt-get install kernel#<version-number>

I can't find any numbers that look like that.

Or is that

Bus 0, device #, Function #

Mine does not show my AGP card.

Should it???

Maybe the fear is that state government would be in a different environment
than everyone else.  A lot of monopolies are fueled by fear of not having
an environment, program, etc. that a customer has.  That environment doesn't
have to be appropriate for the job for this fear to be real.  I would like to 
see problems with Internet proprietorization for example addressed.  It's 
ridiculous that theoretically there is some web site that can crash any web 
browser out there.  Open data standards on public networks would help 
immensely.  The other thing that would help is to require proprietary data, 
etc. to be transmitted across public networks via methods that are non 
interfering with public data, etc.  Ultimately, do agencies need to be 
required to look at open source or do there need to be rigorous software 
testing and friendly neighbor laws?  Access is a major issue driving 
Microsoft to places it otherwise wouldn't reach because of bugs and 
cost.  The real issue seems to be data and application access whether
inolving web based services or not.  I may want to use open source
Excel replacement for example, but I'm afraid that my customer won't
use the same substitute so in the end I'm stuck with Excel.  The open
source community can try to hack Excel but it shouldn't have to do this
where it is easier to write quality software that isn't burdened by the issues
Excel has in it's design.  Excel was written before the Internet and before
many technologies developed, etc.

I see a lot of people get Microsoft anything because it's at work and they 
don't even think about because of the fear that that's what the customer
has and that's my only way to work with that customer.  I would like to
see schools required to design their software use to provide equal
access to users of any operating system, especially open source ones.
An experiment with the schools is probably the place to start.

It is indeed bus, device, function

if you type

less /proc/pci

you should find a section with the words VGA in it. Mine, for an AGP
video card (a Matrox G400), says this:

  Bus  1, device   0, function  0:
    VGA compatible controller: Matrox Graphics, Inc. MGA G400 AGP (rev
3).
      IRQ 10.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=16.Max Lat=32.
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe4000000 [0xe5ffffff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe6000000 [0xe6003fff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe7000000 [0xe77fffff].

In this case, I put in:

PCI:1:0:0

(I believe all AGP cards are found on the PCI bus, for some strange
reason. That may just be some of them, though.)

If that doesn't have it, you might check in /proc/bus and see if there's
an agp directory which might have that type of information.

here's a good place to start:

 http://linuxdocs.org/HOWTOs/Kernel-HOWTO-4.html#ss4.3

Plus there's a lot more docs and howtos out there. Surf around on
linuxdocs.org, it should yield what your looking for (or at least a link
to it). 

You'll also do well getting the source and going through "make config"
or "make menuconfig", reading through the comments and taking some
notes. Chances are the source has modules for your NIC but in case they
are not the driver source that you want you could backup the original,
in the source tree, and copy the new ones to <source tree>/drivers/net.
This driver should come with a .h and one or more .c files. Of course,
after all of this, you'll need to redo the make config and the
recompile.

It looks like Jim Craven is part of the local AeA apratis. Microsoft is a
member of the AeA, which is probably where the "out of state" reference
came from.

If you do a search on Linux in their membership listings
(http://www.aeanet.org/Members/MemberListing.cfm) you get a list of about
21 companies nationwide - including the US office for SuSE!

Here's something interesting I found on the AeA's web page. It's a report
from Jim Craven, which includes a statement about the bill:

So far I've seen no teeth to the argument for passing this bill. Speaker
Minnis raised the challenge; when she made the public claim that the
bill is "a solution looking for a problem" she stated that a problem
does not exist. Your response should be to counter her claim with
evidence that a problem actually does exist and to do so with factual
proof instead of flying mud. All of the proposals and contracts that the
state enters into are public documents, search them and see if there is
any evidence of a problem and, if evidence does exist, make a case based
on this evidence - you know, put up or shut up.

By the way, I'm a huge advocate of OSS and work really hard to
legitimize it in the data center. Unfortunately it's becoming very
apparent, and not just to me, that HB2892 is not about OSS, it's a kill
M$ crusade. Your crusade is beginning to make my efforts to legitimize
OSS increasing difficult - we're starting to get a label here folks, and
it's not a pretty one. 

Enough said, I'll go back to the technical now.

All in all Folks...

If you experience a "Shortened life" on your battery with a laptop, go
back to the manufacturer and see if they have a "Battery Reconditioning"
Program.

Dell has them, Gateway has them, Toshiba has them, and I imagine several
other laptop manufacturers DO have them. They're free programs to
download.

(If you think it's a HOAX then don't download the programs!!)
(Yes, its MS based... Ugggh!!)

Piet

P.S. Yes, I have used the program... and yes I did get quite a bit more
"Battery Usage" out of one charge.

  Just a thought: what if someone tracked software RFPs (Requests for Proposals)
and assembled a group to bid on each one using open source software? There
_are_ costs associated with the acquisition: installation, training, support
and others of which I am ignorant.

  Those in the Un/Under-employed SIG could bid on the specifications. As the
software itself has no direct cost, the total package price should be at the
low end of the bid range. As long as the experience and skills of the team
can fulfill the department's/agency's needs, why not go for it and generate
some income at the same time -- if you're successful?

  If you have the time in your job search to do the initial footwork, get to
know the IT purchase decision makers starting _now_. You're not selling them
anything at this point but getting to know their needs and idiosyncracies

I've thought of this, too - I just wish I had the skills to do it. If the

  Just a thought: what if someone tracked software RFPs (Requests for
Proposals)
and assembled a group to bid on each one using open source software? There
_are_ costs associated with the acquisition: installation, training, support
and others of which I am ignorant.

  Those in the Un/Under-employed SIG could bid on the specifications. As the
software itself has no direct cost, the total package price should be at the
low end of the bid range. As long as the experience and skills of the team
can fulfill the department's/agency's needs, why not go for it and generate
some income at the same time -- if you're successful?

  If you have the time in your job search to do the initial footwork, get to
know the IT purchase decision makers starting _now_. You're not selling them
anything at this point but getting to know their needs and idiosyncracies
and they're getting to know you. If you have established a solid rapport in
advance you'll find that you get a fair and considered look at your
proposal. If it just lands on someone's desk and they don't know you from an

Michael,

  Come to think of it, there are linux consultants who roost here, too. I
think there are lots of opportunities for those who want to make a run at
it.

Maybe I am being paranoid, but what exactly happens when I use up2date
to update my kernel, should I choose to do that?  Do I still need to go
through all the steps of building the kernel (I assume I do) or does it
do it automatically somehow?

I am a little leary of doing it this way and wanted to know what I

This is not an easy task.  I do bid on RFP's and they are a heinous
process.  Often the responses are well over 100 pages and most of that
is busy work.  Sometime I put more work into the RFPs than the contract
length.

Tracking RFPs is a bit of an art as well.

Also there is a fair amount of paperwork involved, not the least of
which is to be preregistered with the state often.

Also most RFPs I see are for work, not product.  Often the products *are
already chosen*.  Thus one of the reasons for the Bill.

Having said that, if people see an RFP they would like to Bid on, I can
review it and see if we could Bid on it using my companies' resources.

Actually, this AEA guy is on our side on another issue: The Super DMCA
bill (SB 655).

I took a look at the link that someone posted yesterday to the AEA site
and found:

"Earlier this year, in at least a dozen states across the country, the
Motion Picture Association of America introduced legislation designed to
crack down on those who pilfer intellectual property over cable and other
communication services. Problem with the model bill as introduced was that
it unintentionally had the potential to criminalize the manufacture of any
and all devices and software used for prohibited purposes, even if they
were never meant for prohibited purposes. AeA and many other trade groups
assembled two weeks ago in Washington, DC, with the MPAA to discuss the
fears and draft amendments that ensure the bill only applies to equipment
intended primarily for stealing service, not all computers and software
"capable of" such theft.

The Oregon bill is SB 655, which has only had a brief hearing so far in
the Senate Judiciary Committee. The MPAA lobbyist in Oregon has agreed to
the AeA amendments and the bill is being redrafted. It's still not clear
whether it will make it through the process, even in the amended form."

from: http://www.aeanet.org/PressRoom/oras_govtaffairs_update_week14.asp

...so maybe the AEA isn't all bad...

He's a pretty busy guy-- he also made sure that spammers could send mail
without an "ADV" tag if they had a "prior business arrangement" with the
recipient.

http://www.oregonlive.com/business/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/business/1052309272198981.xml

-----
Jim Craven, Oregon lobbyist for the American Electronics Association, said
his clients' chief concerns were addressed by two provisions in the House
bill: one that cleared ISPs of any liability for spam and another that
exempts marketers from using the "ADV:" tag if they have a "business
relationship" with a recipient.

"We wanted Hewlett-Packard to be able to transmit to its customer list
advertisements about laptop upgrades," Craven said.
-----

HP is one of the reasons I'm glad I use Sneakemail.  Two of the addresses
I gave them have been deactivated because of spam so far.  (HP Developer
Solutions, and one of their Openview sites.)

I'd still classify unwanted ads about laptop upgrades as spam, but maybe
I'm just getting real cranky about the whole mess.

And they have also been our "best friends" on some other issues.  

Remember that "Politics makes strange bedfellows."  This, like 
losing one's virginity, is a thing that is hard to grok until one 
has experienced it.  

Well, we're experiencing it.  This is why, in politics, everyone 
is normally (except during campaign season) very polite to each

pidof is a link to killall5 on my box. The man page for pidof says this is how
it's supposed to be.

If I do pidof process; I get a pid number returned, if that process is running.
Doing a `killall5 process` returns an error message; killall5: only one
argument, a signal number, allowed. 

So a link is a link, correct? So why does killall5 act differently than pidof?

Strange things can happen when browsers try to guess what you meant to
say.   Malformed HTML somewhere else in the document could have caused a
rendering error in the list, even if the list was fine.

What page was broken?  What does http://validator.w3.org/ say about the

One problem, is that the skills to do software development, or
integration are often different than the skills needed to respond to
RFP/RFQ's, and quite distinct from those needed for Schmoosing with
procurment types.

Looks like you are missing the closing </ol> tag, maybe that causes
the MAC IE 5.0 trouble.

You could be right, but my friend checked on his Mac in IE and it was

Because a program can check the name it is called with and behave
differently given the name.  For example, /bin/gzip and /bin/gunzip are
links (they're hard-links on my system, but that doesn't change their
process name; they can just as easily be symlinks).

killall5 simulates the killall command of SysV UNIX; it sends the given
signal to all processes owned by the calling UID.  When does it root, it
can do very bad things.  BE VERY CAREFUL with the killall command on
!(Linux || BSD) systems!

One problem, is that the skills to do software development, or
integration are often different than the skills needed to respond to
RFP/RFQ's, and quite distinct from those needed for Schmoosing with
procurment types.

not exactly. While I admit I don't know a thing about pidof vs.
killall5, I can tell you a link is not exactly a link:

in most linux distributions, /bin/sh is a link to /bin/bash. However,
bash checks to see if it's been called as /bin/sh, and if so, dumps some
of its bash functionality so as to be perfectly sh compatible (or very
close).

In MacOSX, the same thing, but with /bin/csh is a link to /bin/tcsh.

I found the page (http://www.jonjacob.org/).  My guess is that this HTML
probably confused IE:

-----
<p><font size="+1" face="Helvetica">
   <b>My Positions in a nutshell:</b></p></font>
-----

The <font> tag is opened after the <p>, but <p> is closed before </font>.  
Many browsers get real confused by this "crossing" of HTML tags.

Also, the <b> before <li> might be confusing IE.  Put the <b> inside the
<li> item.

Your best bet is to run this (and any other public-facing document)
through the w3.org validator.  It's a pain, but you can be reasonably
assured that if it doesn't render right, it's someone else's problem.  
;-)

Overall, your HTML looks very good.  Much better than the usual
export-from-MS-Word crap out there.  The attached HTML file should look
the same, and is squeaky-clean 4.01 Transitional HTML.

You know, we've already gone a little overboard with the political
discussions here lately.  Do we really need to turn this into an HTML
forum as well?  I'm sorry, for I've been guilty of this myself, but
adding a little prefix to your subject doesn't make an OT post OK.

It's possible that it was an older or just an "off" version.  If you 
could get a hold of "tidy" http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ it 
really helps your html.

It runs under most OS's.

Just for the archives.

I replaced the motherboard and the computer ran for about 3 weeks.  This
weekend I had the same error.  I could not even boot the computer. I
exchanged the CPU and it booted up just fine.  I can even run X Windows
without it locking up which I never could before.

So the error CPU 0: means that the error is the CPU, doah. :)

Hey Billy,
If you have perl 5.8 than I don't think that you'll need to reinstall
perl. The modules that your talking about are perl modules and they can
be installed from CPAN. You can get them by running perl -MCPAN -e shell
as root and doing install <modulename> from the cpan prompt. If for some
reason you want to install perl you can do that from here as well. The
modules that it is probably wanting are DBD and DBI for MySQL.

Dude, I feel your pain.

Building RT is an exercise in what can only be called the Perl analog
to DLL hell. In addition to installing a ton of Red Hat's prebuilt
perl-* packages, I ended up building over 40 home-brewed rpms.

If you're on an rpm-based system (Red Hat, SuSE, Mandrake), cpan2rpm 
can be a life saver:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpan2rpm/

If, on the other hand, you're not concerned about being able to 
reinstall all those modules on another host, I think RT includes a 
perl script (the name escapes me) that will bring your system up to 
date.

In addition to the excellent advice you received earlier, I would
recommend joining the rt-users mailing list. I'm a member of that one,
and it is very active and helps folks get RT up and running all the
time. 

Make sure you are very specific about the problem. Give as much
information as you can. i.e. What module you are installing that's
having a problem, what the error is, and so forth. 

Including the version of RT, perl, apache, and mySQL that you're using
are good too. 

The RT mailing list is listed here:
http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/lists.html

You may be able to find the answer to your question in the mailing list
archives, which are also available on that page.

I haven't looked at it, but the real reason we went with RT in the
first place was that it was able to snarf all of our old req items
into the new system. Requirements to handle legacy systems trump just
about anything.  :-)

Once it's running, however, RT ain't so bad.

Once you do get it working (I cant offer any more advice than has been
given..) you may not be able to load dri and xinerama at the same
time, or if you just want to play with X..

You can set up multiple ServerLayout sections, with different
identifiers and choose your layout when you run startx,

$ startx -- -layout "single-head" 
for example.

You can alse start up additional xservers with --:n where n increments
with the number of xservers (starting at 0). 

so, if you want to run xinerama and a single-head (or just, not
xinerama) simeotaneously you can start the second server with:

$ startx --:1 -layout "single-head"

where single-head is the identifier of the layout you want (it
defaults to the first layout in your xconfig file.

Here are two layouts from my box, if anyone wants to see syntax.


Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier      "xinerama"
        Screen          "Screen 0" LeftOf "Screen 1"
        Screen          "Screen 1" 0 0
        InputDevice     "Generic Keyboard"
        InputDevice     "Configured Mouse"
        Option          "xinerama"
EndSection


Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier      "single-head"
        Screen "Screen 0"
        InputDevice     "Generic Keyboard"
        InputDevice     "Configured Mouse"
EndSection



On a related note.. does anyone know if it is possible to have dri and
xinerama with a G400? (I also hear AA fonts are better behaved in

Just came across your post for WINE

http://www.algo.be/logo1/MSWLLinux.html

This is all French to me. Can you please expound on this.  The cash
strapped Portland Public Schools is migrating to Linux.  I'd like to
get MSW to continue to run on the PC labs.

Just curious ... What would be needed to recompile MSW to run on
Linux directly?

Has anyone else had trouble getting True Type fonts to register in Red
Hat 9.0? With 7 and 8 I could do the following, and boom, it's done:

chkfontpath --add /directory/fonts/are/in
ttmkfdir -o fonts.scale
mkfontdir

In RH9, the fonts don't list in Mozilla. They DO list in Galeon, but if
you select them, a different font is substituted. Anyone figured this
out? I've search the Red Hat site, and can only find instructions for 7.

Thanks!

Subject: [PLUG] CSS question (scripting?)
Message-ID: <E19EBOo-0008Em-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

I've been doing some work with CSS styles; and it seems that the best way to do
it, in general, is to link webpages to external stylesheets. I'm trying to get
some consistency on my home site, and it's "inconvenient" to search and replace
for 5 instances of the same color to replace it with another color. Here it's a
link color, there it's a border. 

 If I associate *.css files with php in apache (in the .htaccess file, for
instance), I could use variables within them, right? Then I could modify the
variable at the top and have it replaced all through out the stylesheet. Is that
the best way to do it? 

Or would it be better to write a "stylesheet.inc" file that I'd use like
"include("stylesheet.inc")" and it'd show up as inline- it'd wind up being the
same, functionally, wouldn't it? 

And is there someone I should talk to about bringing my PC to the meeting on the
17th to get some help upgrading my old slackware to shiny clean debian? I have
some CDs.

Yes, however, if you're going to go this route I *highly* recommend just
naming your css files .css.php instead.  Also, if you do this, you'll
need to remember to set the Content-Type header to text/css in the PHP
code. (header("Content-Type","text/css"), I believe).

This is the other alternative, and is probably better than having PHP
process all of your CSS files.  Additionally, this allows you to set up
the actual style in an external stylesheet and only specify colors
inline.

Once I tried setting up a stylesheet that was a PHP script.  So I had
this:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.php" type="text/css">

And my style.php would print CSS stuff, to do things similar to what
you're talking about.  But for some reason it wouldn't work correctly.
I never did investigate to find out why.

well, you can use if you just dynamically add your css to the top of every 
page, then you can set up a very simple template for your css. just put 
%color% in place of where the color should go in your css file and read the 
file into a variable. then take that string and run str_replace to replace 
all instances of %color% with the color you would like. then shove it into 
your page. you could also have a template stored to read in, change the do 
the replacement, then write it back out to the location of the actual css 
file.

Depending on how long ago it was, it might have been because browsers
had lousy support for CSS.  Netscape 4 and older versions of IE make it
nearly impossible.  These days, CSS works pretty well with Mozilla and
derivatives, Opera, and to a limited extent, IE.  (For example, IE seems
to ignore width: but will use max-width:.)

It might have also been that your MIME-type wasn't being set in the HTTP
header; I'm not sure how the type attribute from the link element
affects it.

At this point, it's mostly a "hint" to the browser, which it largely
ignores.  Mozilla will print a warning in the JavaScript console if the
type attribute and the Content-Type header of a file don't match, but it
will pretend that the type attribute has the correct information and
proceed.

SQL-Ledger isn't too bad, depending on what your needs are.  GnuCash
isn't still really good for business purposes (it's not intended to be),
because it doesn't have things like invoicing, purchase orders, and
such.

I've been using Nola from Noguska, its an Apache-MySQL-PHP application. 
It is open source (OSI certified - GNU license, but check the licenses
of dependant libraries), and Noguska is willing to customize - help (for
a fee, of course).  I haven't been using it long enough to give a true
evaluation; and I've never used quickbooks, so I really can't compare,
but it is a full featured - easily modifiable accounting package.

BTW, I'm running it in User-mode linux, let me know if you want a copy
of the base system.

Subject: [PLUG] Texas' open source hearing
Message-ID: <200305091303.49268.pundit@teleport.com>

The Great State of Texas held hearings yesterday on their open 
source bill, SB 1579.

Texas legislators have a little more backbone than the ones in the 
committee that heard the Oregon bill.  Here's an exchange between 
Sen. John Carona (R-Dallas), the bill's sponsor, and Mario Correa 
(who also travelled to Oregon to testify against our bill) of the 
Business Software Alliance.

In his testimony, Correa was wasting the committee's time 
objecting to portions of the bill that had been removed in 
amendments (which Texas refers to as a "substitute"), when Sen. 
Carona interrupted him:

---------------------------------------------------------
Correa:  As I was saying, essentially what we're doing in this 
bill is to single out one particular type of development for 
further study, review and effectively promotion.  Now I also, as 
some of the earlier witnesses mentioned, think that studying 
these issues can be a perfectly positive thing but that's not the 
intent of this legislation.  The intent is to presuppose cost 
savings by one particular model of software development.  Now, in 
some cases open source software can save money; in other cases it 
doesn't.  As the witnesses mentioned the cost of software is 
primarily in its upkeep and maintenance and training.  It's not 
in the actual initial costs of acquisition.  So in acquiring 
software for free at the inception this does not mean that 
software will over the long term will be less costly. Now, folks 
at the Department of Information Resources know that as well as 
they know many other information technology issues that arise 
before them and that's why they currently have the ability to 
procure the kinds of software that makes sense to them and to 
conduct the kinds of investigations that they think makes sense 
in terms of their resources.  I don't think that this bill gives 
them a power that they don't currently have but rather seeks to 
set one model above others.  I don't...

[Sen. Carona signals the Chair]  

Chair:  Senator Carona?

Carona:  Sir, have you read the five lines of this committee 
substitute?  

Correa:  I believe I have sir, in fact...

Carona:  Do you know that all it says is, "Shall publish 
guidelines relating to the information a state agency must 
consider in determining whether the agency should acquire open 
source software products in addition to proprietary software."  
Now, what are you threatened by?

Correa:  Well, I understand, Senator, that you left out a previous 
section in the latest iteration.  The previous section talked 
about how the report must include the department's 
recommendations that effectively...

Carona:  That's not...

Correa:  That's no longer... that's correct.  But the point that 
I'm trying to make is, essentially what you've done is to isolate 
one particular development of software for further investigation, 
assuming that there isn't something already being considered or 
the State has already undertaken.  What makes our industry 
nervous is not that you study any particular type but rather that 
you select one under a presupposition of cost savings or not cost 
savings for that matter.

Carona:  Well, if you'll read the language again, we have already 
presupposed that proprietary software will exist and will be 
what's purchased.  This simply says shall we consider any other 
alternatives?  That means specifically... 

I don't...  Again, I don't understand why you all are so 
threatened by this, but from a careful look at the lobbyists in 
this room that are representing Microsoft, and all of you here 
representing proprietary software companies which -- let's face 
it, that's where the big money is, it's not in Open Source it's 
in proprietary -- it's rather transparent as to why you all feel 
so threatened by this language.  And I'll tell you, this [bill] 
is innocuous, but next session I'll be on a crusade.  

Correa:  Thank you.

Carona:  Any further testimony, Mr. Correa?

Correa:  Uh, that's all right.

Carona:  Thank you for being here today.

And that was the end of of the BSA's BS in the Texas State 
Legislature.  My opinion of Texans has just increased by an order 
of magnitude.

A recording of this can be heard at 
http://www.Senate.state.tx.us/ram/archive/2003/may/050803StAffpm.ram

This exchange occurred about one hour and 28 minutes into the 
recording.

Subject: [PLUG] Minnis answers questions at City Club
Message-ID: <3EBC1722.8000700@hevanet.com>

Karen Minnis gave a speech at the Portland City Club today. The first question 
following her talk was about measure 2892. It went roughly like this:

"I appreciate your addressing themes of fiscal reponsibility and doing more with 
the money we send to Salem. My question concerns HB 2892 which would require 
state agencies to consider Open Source software potentially saving tens of 
millions of dollars.

In Tuesday's Oregonian you called this bill a solution searching for a problem. 
Meanwhile, Oregon's "Perfect Storm" is cutting days from our school year, 
cutting people off of medical benefits and is cutting felons loose from our 
jails. In the sense that this bill would save tens of millions of dollars, it is 
a solution that has found a problem.

My question is Please, for the sake of all Oregonians, will you bring this bill 
to the floor of the house for an open debate?"

Her response talked about agencies already being able to choose open source and 
how the bill had missed some kind of procedural deadline.

My follow-up question was roughly "With all due respect, I understand that 
they're allowed to save us money, i'm suggesting that we should pass a law that 
makes them actively consider doing so, especially if we are looking under every 
rock to find money like you say"

Her response shifted the debate by claiming that the money savings weren't clear 
and that this had been debated in the committee.

I closed with the comment that I'd really like to see that debate take place on 
the floor of the house.

I believe this will be aired on Oregon Public Radio 91.5 FM Tuesday at Noon.

chaz,

  Gnucash has added more business support. I've been using the Linux General
Ledger; some day I may even get the time to finish writing the A/P and A/R
portions, too.

I am piddling around with a little project of getting linux running on

which will run linux (I've partially booted it), but lacks a good way
to move data onto it.  No ethernet.  I don't have any other Mac's that
I could use to AppleTalk it over.  It's got a lousy 14400 internal

meg of data or so.  Any ideas?

  Can you build SLIP or PLIP into the kernel and use a serial or parallel

If it has a pcmcia slot there are many options or if you can pull the
HD, then you can plug it into a desktop with a cheap ($5) adapter and
install there.

I've had to resort to tar/gzip + split + a couple of floppies before.

Parallel port IP might also work, but I've had problems getting it going
in the past.  (http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Net-HOWTO/x1650.html)

Nope.  No pcmcia.

Don't know if I can pull the HD or not.  It _is_ a SCSI disk,
connected to a 5380 controller.  What adapter are you referring to?

Currently, I've booted to where the kernel looks for a root filesystem
and, not finding one, it panics.

Getting the necessary files onto the HD, I've resorted to dialing into
an ISP and ftp'ing files off of the machine on my DSL-connected
desktop.  Just seems like there ought to be a better way.  I'd happily
resort to floppies if I knew how to concatenate split binary files
under MacOS.

Hmm. Okay, now I've set up an external SCSI from spare parts.
Penguin-19 even tells me it is there /dev/sdb.  Hmm, how to get access
to it though.

How disingenious.  Yes, it missed a procedural deadline -- at her 
orders.  However, lots of other bills that missed that deadline 
get considered anyway.  You see, under House rules the Speaker 
has the authority to waive that deadline and let a bill 
through....

So she told you a half-truth.  Ever heard the saying, "A 
half-truth is a whole lie"?

Something tells me this is all going to come back and haunt her 
next year when she runs for re-election....  I hope you Portland 
folks give her h*ll when that time comes!

Digging around in my junk drawer, I discovered that I actually have
one of these SCSI connectors, and a 25-pin to 50-pin SCSI cable.  I
don't quite understand the significance of the switch, but with it
"off" it seems to "work".  Says:

   "SCSI  DOCK"
    off    on

I have an external SCSI disk connected, which isn't going to give me
networking, but at least it'll give me a way to get large files onto
it.

I actually have it _almost_ working.  Just trying to find a kernel
that works right now.  With the prebuilt ones on the sourceforge site:

  <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=11666>

and a debian root.bin, with their 2.2.25 kernel, I can boot to a
"System Installation" screen, but the keyboard is dead.  With their
2.4.1 kernel, I get happier looking boot messages, but it doesn't seem
to get past:

ADB is "Apple Desktop Bus". I think that you'll have better luck using a

As a previous poster mentioned, there's a script included on the Knoppix
ISO that makes it a pretty simple matter to copy the image onto your
local hard drive. You'll need to know a few basic things about Linux,
such as how to partition your drive. Other than that, it's pretty much
auto-pilot. It was by far the easiest OS install I've ever done, and
I've done many (including Windoze and MacOS).

The only issues I had with Knoppix after copying it to a local drive
were with KDE user settings. Stuff like language preferences, and a few
Open Office path settings had to be modified.

If you can get a SCSI drive to work, that'd be the best route. If not,
why don't you just use the serial port?

Aladdin's StuffIt utility can handle tar files and such, but I'm not
sure if it can split/concat tarball fragments (though it can do so with
it's own native format -- not that that's helpful).

Well, the guy you quoted explains it pretty well. Old SCSI-based
PowerBooks had an extra pin on their odd-ball SCSI port. If the cable
you used had that pin present, then the PowerBook would enter "SCSI
target" mode and act as an external SCSI device to whatever it was
plugged into. Without the pin, it was the host and whatever was on the
other end would be, well, itself.

I can't offer much help with kernel issues. I've only installed Linux on
PPC Macs, and didn't even know someone was still attempting a 68k port
(beyond the all-but-dead MkLinux project). NetBSD is supposed to work
pretty well on 68k hardware, though. :-)

ADB is the "Apple Desktop Bus." It's what Apple used for HID stuff
(keyboards, mice, etc.) for many years. Looking at your kernel messages,
it's not immediately apparent what's causing it to freeze.

Ahhh.... Finally here is something to which I can apply my old Mac
experience. The Powerbook 180c is an ancient laptop with some nice
engineering and some serious headaches for the Linux enthusiast.

SUMMARY:
Russell Senior [mailto:seniorr at aracnet.com] wants to move data onto it and
he's gotten part-way through booting Linux, but the kernel panics when it
can't find a filesystem.

Steve Bonds [1s7k8uhcd001 at sneakemail.com] suggested a parallel port IP link,
but the machine lacks a parallel port. He also suggested tar/gzip + split +
a couple of floppies, but this seems painful.

Rogan Creswick creswick at cs.orst.edu suggested pcmcia or a hard drive
transplant, but Russell responded that the machine lacks pcmcia.

The hard drive is SCSI and it can be removed with appropriate tools. It's
got a funny sort of SCSI connector that may make things difficult to connect
to a desktop machine. If the hard drive is still in a Macintosh format, you
may have further difficulty mounting the HFS filesystem. Other items in your
post make it appear as though this is not the problem.

Rich Shepard [rshepard at appl-ecosys.com] suggested building SLIP into the
kernel, but that would require a Macintosh high-speed modem cable to change
from the Din-8 RS-449 serial connector on the Mac to some DB25 or DB9 Serial
RS-232 connection used by the rest of the civilized world.

SUGGESTION:
Either SCSI or Serial is the way to go, but either way will require an
odd-ball cable.

SCSI: There is a SCSI connector on the back of the laptop with a bunch of
high-density pins in a rectangular array. Back when PowerBook 180c was a
current machine, there were third party vendors who made an adapter that
would convert this to a DB-25 (SCSI 1) connector. Particularly clever third
party vendors made an adapter with a little switch on it. When you leave the
switch in normal position, the PowerBook could communicate with SCSI
peripherals. In the other position, the PowerBook would boot into a mode
where it acted as a plain-old Macintosh SCSI disk drive. I don't know where
you can find this adapter today, but I'll check my personal tool-box to see
if I still have mine. There were also a few folks who sold  SCSI drive boxes
and power bricks that would enclose a PowerBook drive and give it a standard
50-pin Amphenol (SCSI 1) connector or two. I used to have one of these, but
I sold it to a neighbor. She has upgraded her system a few times since then
and I don't know where the enclosure has gone.

Serial:
Traveling Software made a product called LapLink Mac for transferring data
over the serial cable between a Macintosh and a DOS- or Windows-based PC.
The required cable was included with the software. I don't know if they are
still in business or not, nor do I know if they still sell this product. I
have kept my copy of this software, but it requires the Macintosh OS
(probably 6.x or 7.x) on the Mac side and DOS or Windows on the PC side.
Still, the cable may be valuable for serial-port redirection.

FreeGeek.org may have either or both of these adapters in its junk-drawer,
since they often receive odd-ball stuff. They also have contact with some
other organization that refurbishes/recycles used Macintoshes. This other
group may have some clues for you. If nobody else has a magic bullet, let me
know and I can arrange a face-to-face so that you may borrow one or more of
these adapters.

external SCSI disk, which is "ready to go".  Also, I managed to cobble
together a null-modem cable out of what must have been an external
modem cable and an old laplink cable, the kind with both 9-pin and
25-pin connectors at each end, which allowed me to connect to the
25-pin cable end and the 9-pin connection at the other computer.  I am
currently using zmodem to move the 6meg macinstall.tar.gz file over.
With this rig, though, I don't seem to have hardware handshaking
(turned on XON/XOFF instead), and line noise is killing me at 57600,
so I had to drop back to 38400, and even there I was getting periodic
CRC errors.  Getting about 3kbytes/second.

Can someone suggest a source for Mac-to-9-pin null-modem cables,
preferably that will support hardware handshaking?  

I think I'll end up connecting the box with PPP over a null-modem to
my router.  The null-modem will be slower than I'm used to, but faster
than over a phone line.  The router box already got 4 IP interfaces
(not counting "lo"), so why not a fifth, right?

The people at sf lost the plugins. I was lookging for the vacation plugin
and ended up finding a 1.2 version on one of my servers. I've got it if
you want it. One of the regulars in the IRC channel typed in a link to his
copies of many of them, but alas, my browser history is failing me and
since vacation is the only one I've used I didn't save the URL.

To get to the IRC channel, go to irc.freenode.net, #squirrelmail

Cheers,
Keith

Ken, and all,
It's oxymoronic, perhaps to write this to the list, but let's find 
another forum for this type of discussion. I actually followed up and 
emailed the representatives listed in the first posting.  And I'll join 
another list ("geeks-on-oregon-policy", pdx-goop-list?). But, as 
important as this topic is, I'd like to continue to follow "rules" 
pertinent to the list and keep the postings on topic: perl mongering.
Thanks,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0305111732400.25841-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Yesterday I went to FreeGeek to buy a set of RH 9.0 cdroms to send to an
acquaintance. They didn't have any available.

  Does anyone have a full set? If so, would you be willing to burn them on
cds if I bring them over? I'm trying to save the time of 3.6G of downloads.
I'll also trade disks if there's an available set.

TIA,

I guess I'm just a knee-jerk anti-ms-ite, but I don't see how this is
off topic.

As one who as been called "off-topic" on more than one occasion, I think I
can help you understand why this is off topic.

This list is for getting help, and helping other to use, run, configure,
any of the different *nix type OSes. This includes, but is not limited to,
Linux, HP-UX, AIX, Solaris, *BSD, Tru64, and Irix.

It is not a political list. It is not a vi vs emacs list.

I've also heard it said that when people start complaining about any
particular topic, that topic is automatically off-topic. Sort of like
invoking Godwin's Law, without the Nazi/Hitler part.
(http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/g/Godwin_s_Law.html)

Plug has a list for "off-topic" discussions. plug-talk at pdxlinux.org. It's
very quiet right now.

If I'm incorrect, I'm sure I'll be corrected within seconds of this
posting. :)

Fry's has a decent selection of RJ45-to-[your_favorite_connector_here]
some-assembly-required kits. They just might have a MiniDIN-9 kit, too.
Then all you need is an Ethernet cable and the know-how to wire up the
connectors properly. :-)  I did it with DB-9 connectors -- it's not that
tough.

Do you have SCSI working in the kernel? If you can find a Powerbook SCSI
cable, I have an old EZ135 drive and disks you can borrow.

There is also the MOSS list, which the Perl Monger's list directed the

Yes, Brian has agreed to have any political discussions around 2892 on the MOSS 
list. For my part, should I have any info to post, i'll probably post it to the 
PLUG and Perl lists with a suggestion to take any follow up conversations to the 
MOSS list.

I have received several private emails expressing gratitude for the 
informational updates. So I think a few informational posts on political issues 
is a tolerable info/noise trade-off.

With any luck, there are still a few more things that will need to be announced 
over the next couple of weeks.

I think that "the list" Thomas Keller was referring to was the
portland perl-monger list.  Personally, I think it is on-topic for
plug.  I have never seen any "rules" for the plug general list that
excluded discussion of free/open-source software politics.  Plug-talk
is really there for discussions of "What is Money", who invaded Kuwait
and why, that sort of thing.  Check the archives, you'll see.

I tend to agree.

This is a timely OpenSource topic, and I really haven't heard anyone
complain about using the PLUG list for this discussion.  Thus, I
think this topic is well suited to the PLUG list.

  Are there any java application (not applet or Web) developers here? I'm
starting to learn the language and will be porting a C program to java but I
have several questions about assembling the final package for distribution
or use.

  For example, since paths are included in .jar files, what allows the
program to be installed and run on a completely different system? If
applications consist of "hundreds or thousands of classes" (according to the
ORA "Learning Java" authors), and each class has to be compiled separately,
how the heck does one manage the project? And, since java has
easy-to-implement threads, can an application be built to run on
multi-processor machines or Beowulf clusters with appropriate processes
running in parallel?

Message-ID: <20030512173143.GA31119@boora.com>

I use smtpd to receive mail, hand it off to a python app that runs it
through spamassasin and then sends it to our Exchange server.  I have a
problem with some emails that have multiple reipients within our domain.
The sending server times out waiting for a response to the RCPT TO: on
the second recipient, and nobody gets the mail.  I've removed the
filtering that smtpd can do to no avail.  When we send all mail directly
to Exchange, it works great.  So it seems the problem is smtpd or the
spamassassin/python app.  I'm searching for opinions, test, theories.  I
have good tethereal captures of bothe good and bad cases if anyone would
find them interesting.  There is a lot of info there that I can't
understand.

the jar is a zip file, with the bytecode compiled classes included. If
you include the jar in your classpath and run the class in it with a
main routine, it'll work fine on a different system. There are ways to
make executing the jar find and execute java and stuff.

Applications _can_ consist of hundreds or thousands of classes. They can
also be one or two calsses. There's no rule.

For managing huge projects, I recommend: ant, IBM Eclipse (free beer),
or your favorite Java-enabled IDE (CodeWarrior, etc). They will manage
the compilation of the projects, and turn them into jar files at your
wish. ant is open source, built by the Apache project, and works wonders
(is similar to makefiles, but cleaner).

multiprocessor machines are easy--threads are fairly good, and will run
in parallel. Beowulf clusters are harder and depend on how the cluster
is set up--if it's invisible to the program and just looks like a
multiprocessor machine, threading it should do it. If it's the standard
cheap, ssh-based beowulf cluster, then you have some work to do.

Subject: [PLUG] How rcpthosts under qmail works...
Message-ID: <1052761220.2318.49.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm getting the impression that any domain that isn't under rcpthosts is
denied, but this is awfully restrictive where I want to allow my trusted
users to send to anywhere and anyone to be able to send to me.  Short of
being an open relay, what option is there to make the latter happen
transparently?

I'm guessing with smtp protocol that it doesn't know the difference
between inbound and outbound traffic.   

I would think all you'd want to block is email not going to or coming
from your local network plus spam/malicious email.  Wouldn't the latter
protect against blacklisting due to being an open relay?

Hopefully moving from kmail under Redhat 7.2 to evolution under 7.3 will
help security wise.  I've gotten Maildir boxes going for the first time
also :-)

I wonder if evolution reads rcpthosts where kmail seemingly didn't or
does this file merely affect qmail?  This is the first time I've ever
removed the mail and the procmail programs.  Has anyone experimented
with creating two home areas for their users and modifying the user
account creation scripts to place the maildir in one area while 
setting a user's home to the other?  Using UW-IMAP before I guess
creating a non-login user for the imap accounts will help seperate 
the imap files from other files.  Trouble is, I want the normal 
account name to be the email name also.  I would like the user's
home directory to be free of their email stuff although the .qmail
should stay there as should any home directory stuff for qconfirm, etc.

I used IMAP before because I figured that IMAP doesn't download files
off the server and I also figured with IMAP that one can A have multiple
email accounts and B create folders on the server.  I'm wondering what
to do now realizing that qmail has it's own pop3 program and I'm using
Maildir.  I need to set it up so that any computer on local network 
can be used to access an email account without risk of email being
loaded down onto that single client machine.  Such a download causes
email to "disappear" from the other possible client machines.  I only
want to allow deleting from the server and need to prevent any client
machine from serving one of my email accounts.  IMAP reading a listing
of the emails is also faster than POP which has to download all of them.
POP3 unless it copies the email off the server isn't going to work 
at all and could easily cause synchronization issues between what 
is on server verses the client machines.  

Since I have X Terminal support I wonder if evolution can be set to
local delivery instead of IMAP/POP?  Achieving the latter would likely
satisfy my don't download to client machine requirement for my email 
server although it might annoy my Windows user's who don't have one
of our ISP's email boxes.

BTW:
I tried out Eudora for a Window's user and it appears far more stable
than Outlook Express :-)  I get a lot of Outlook complaints because it
crashes if an account disappears or the network is momentarily down
instead of exiting nicely.  I should probably kick up to dhcp3 and
figure out how to do a backup server but I use dhcp for ltsp and I
don't want to back up that component of it only desiring to be able
to hand out the ip information to the workstations when my terminal
server/mailhub is down..

What's the proper way to add an MX record for a subdomain?

For example:

$ttl 2D
;
@       IN      SOA     ns1.mydomain.com. hostmaster.mydomain.com. (
                2003051201      ; Serial
                21600           ; Refresh 6 hours
                900             ; Retry 15 minutes
                3600000         ; Expire
                43200           ; Default 12 hours
)

                        IN      NS      ns1.mydomain.com.
                        IN      NS      ns2.mydomain.com.

                        IN      MX      10 mail.mydomain.com.
sub1                    IN      MX      10 mail2.mydomain.com.

                        IN      A       10.10.10.1
sub1                    IN      A       10.10.10.2
sub2                    IN      A       10.10.10.3
mail                    IN      A       10.10.10.4



This, unfortunately, seems to break everything that follows the MX record
for sub1.  Do I have the syntax wrong?
Thanks,

  Can both servers have the same rank?

They're for different sites...  mail.mydomain.com is for mydomain.com and
mail2.mydomain.com is for sub1.mydomain.com.

  Thanks, Jeff. The jar file I understood. I'm trying to understand how a
complete java application is bundled and distributed as compared, for
example, to the binary executable file that results when a C program is
compiled and linked.

  True. But the jar file then becomes quite large, no?

  There's also netbeans that I'm trying to understand. It's open source and
apparently the equivalant of Sun's proprietary IDE.

  So one of these would be a better choice than emacs?

  Ah! So, no high performance, parallelizing compiler ($$$) is needed then.
That's certainly a major benefit of java apps. 

  Many thanks! I'll be back for more -- I'm sure -- when I've read more and
start on this immediate need project.

Yes, both servers could have the same precedence even if they were for
the same domain.

I think you want to either start the MX record for the top level
domain with an @ or mydomain.com. to indicate it is the MX for the domain
or move them near the NS records (which would require an @ if they were
moved elsewhere in the zone file).

Subject: [PLUG] smbfs kernel module on gentoo
Message-ID: <1052776889.3ec019b97f34f@webmail.fiddlers-green.info>

Hey all,

I've been struggling with this for about three days and haven't been able to
find an answer through the web or on gentoo's site. Every time I run a depmod
-ae after making the smbfs module I recieve the following:

depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in
lib/modules/2.4.20-gentoo-r2/kernel/fs/smbfs/smbfs.o
depmod:         load_nls_Rsmp_afd2e7ee
depmod:         unload_nls_Rsmp_36a16ffc

I went back into menuconfig and set everything under Native Language Support to
M and reran the make but each on of the nls entries seems to require the
load_nls and unload_nls (as well as other dependencies). I came across an email
thread that indicated that smp (Symetric Multiprocessing?) wasn't need on single
cpu machines. Since I'm running on a single cpu, I turned this off in
menuconfig. It is something that gets compiled into the kernel and is not a
module though. Would I need to recompile the kernel to remove smp? Is that what
depmod is referring to? If not, does anyone know what the dependency that
contains those symbols might be?
 
thanks,
Dan H.

Message-ID: <1052778317.3ec01f4d88f8e@webmail.fiddlers-green.info>

Hey all,

I need to get some input from people who have setup multihosting for clients
using linux.

I'm doing some volunteer work for a nonprofit who is getting web hosting through
company in Portland. The company is a windows shop with 1 redhat linux server.
Their normal business pratice is not to give server or shell access to the
clients. On windows this probably best practice. However, I'm trying to build a
LAMP application for the nonprofit, so I need access to the server. The problem
is that they have setup the nonprofit user and put it in a jail.

I figured this was probably not normal practice for linux hosting, though I
haven't worked for a hosting company. I have to go back and argue for greater
access to the server, i.e. a user not setup in a jail. Other than normal user
and group priveleges I was wondering if there were other steps that were taken?
Are there any good books or docs on the web that explain Linux and multihosting?
(I've been looking, maybe not hard enough, and haven't found any).

thanks,
Dan H.

After you  set the NLS support to M, did you run 
make modules; make modules_install
to install the nls modules?
Before you do that, turn the smp back on in menuconfig. This will keep your
modules consistent with the kernel without having to recompile the kernel.

If you were to shut the machine down and then switch-on the SCSI Dock
switch, you would be able to connect the PowerBook to another computer as if
it were a plain-old external SCSI hard drive. It would remain in this mode
until you shut it down. This is probably the fastest way to load-up your
drive with a big file, as long as you are able to mount the filesystem.

I can't really help you any more than others already have with regard to
finding an M68k-based kernel. Others have already noted that ADB stands for
Apple Desktop Bus; it's their old (pre-USB) system for daisy-chaining
low-speed serial input devices such as mice, keyboards, and low-res
digitizing tablets.

OK...  this is getting really frustrating...  If I add the MX record for
the subdomain, even if I have the @ or mydomain.com in front of the other
MX record, I still can't resolve any of the following subdomains.  So if I
also had foo as a subdomain, it won't show up when querying from other DNS
servers.  Once I remove the second MX record, foo shows up (when querying
another DNS server that hasn't already cached the previous lookup). 
Where's Ed the DNS guy when you need him...
So again, to review, I just want to add an MX record for one of the
subdomains in my zone file.  Shouldn't be this difficult...
Thanks,

Technically you should monkey with $ORIGIN when ever you play with
subdomains.

$ORIGIN mydomain.com.

@	IN	SOA	dns.mydomain.com. hostmaster.mailserver.mydomain.com. (
		... serial/refresh/etc)
	IN	NS	dns.mydomain.com.
	IN	MX	10 mailserver.mydomain.com.
$ORIGIN subdomain.mydomain.com.
	IN	MX	10 mailserver.mydomain.com.
$ORIGIN mydomain.com.

And always watch the dots (think everything needs to be fully qualified
whether with a trailing . or by the $ORIGIN).

I believe the subdomains MX record should be in it's own file. When you
specify an MX record, aren't you listing mail exchangers for the domain
as a whole?

Delegate that domain to it's own file, and move that domains MX record
to that file.

OR, you could do what I do. I have postfix set up to receive all the
mail for my domain and subdomains. Postfix then knows to forward mail to
certain subdomains to a different mail server.

this is the rcpthosts files sole purpose, to control what domain(s) can
access the smtp daemon. Incoming mail is destined for users that are on
the domains listed in rcpthosts and messages that are destined for
foreign hosts originate from a domain that is listed in rcpthosts or
they are not processed by qmails smtp daemon. If your using tcpserver
you'll also need to add the trusted network segment addresses to the

only qmail. The pop/imap client probably should not have access to that
file since removing the entries or deleting the file will turn your mail

try putting your maildirs where you would like them and use ln -s to

This is best practice on all server hosting in my opinion.  I don't know
any true web app that requires shell access for the user.  You should be
able to upload a complete solution provided that the tools to run the
product are available.

Don't know what LAMP applications do but I also chroot my user when they
ftp to the server.  This is mostly for security reasons but I have not had
anyone ever ask for shell access other then to play around with the
server. Why does LAMP need you to have a shell access to the server?

I haven't read many books on how to do it but there are huge amount of
resources on the web for a variety of different hosting applications and
how to deploy them in a multi-hosted environment.

Well, personally I think pulling out my fingernails with pliers would be a
better choice than emacs, but that's just me.  Yes, eclipse/ant/etc will
keep track of class dependancies and handle all the rebuilding/rejarring
and so forth.  Ant seems to be on its way to becoming the de facto
standard make equivalent for Java projects, and eclipse can use Ant for
builds.  Ant has its own idiosyncracies - it helps to have a good
understanding of XML, and personally I find it just as annoying as
makefiles, just in different ways.

But with Ant you only have to pull out your fingernails once for all the
platforms while with make files you get to do it over and over for every
OS you build on. ;-)

Learned what a LAMP application is now. I feel so much more edumacated.
 :-)  I still don't see why you need something special other then access to
 a MySQL database and PHP.  I would think the chroot'd part would
 not affect your deployment at all.  If you have any particular problems
 you think would be an issue I could test them for you.  I do use all the
 application that consist of a LAMP project and python and perl as well.
 Never had any problems with users being chrooted.

Subject: [PLUG] tcl question
Message-ID: <3EC09683.1050107@pacifier.com>

I'm diving headfirst into tcl with someone else's code.  Since his code 
works (just want to better it) and the books I have aren't that good, it 
makes sense to learn off this app.

Figured the breadth of knowlege here might give a quick response.

Has to do with the 'binary format' bit below.  I can't figure out why it is 
necessary & how it even works.  (I did read 'man binary' a few times).  The 
idea is to send commands to a serial attached device.  The command set is 
analogous to the Hayes AT set.

Why does 'puts' yield nothing?  And why would a device that is expecting a 
packet of hex values need a binary conversion?

#!/bin/sh
# the next line restarts using wish \
exec wish "$0" "$@"

set bin_cmd [ binary format "H2H2" 11 00 ]
puts stderr bin_cmd=$bin_cmd

exit


Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

I think it's sinking in, everything is a string.  The device doesn't want to 
see ascii, it wants binary.  And $bin_cmd just doesn't make sense to the 
terminal window.

To interogate the variable,

	binary scan $bin_cmd "H*" s
	puts s=$s

cool.

The idea is to define "11 00" as a global var.  Brute for trial-and-error I 
guess.  Have a list of recommended Tcl books, but Powell's has none of them. 
  BTW, any pointer to what "$0" and "$@" mean in the wish invocation?  Same 
as bash?

REMOTE_USER will be empty unless the script is protected by some
authentication step.  Have you protected the script with something
like "BasicAuth"?

And, it has nothing to do with the "remote" "user".  It's just the
name of the user as authenticated to the webserver.  If you've visited
a web site, gotten a pop-up box that described a "realm" and wanted a
"username" and "password", it's like that.

If you're creating a new application, "BasicAuth" while being simple,
basically sucks.  Since you're hacking Perl, look at my article at

  Chacun a son gout. Some folks cannot work without a GUI and think that a
browser interface is the only way to go. Others of us -- including me --
much prefer the CLI but go gooey because we need to. That's neither here nor
there. Visters cannot understand emacians and vice-versa. :-)

  Ah! Thank you for putting the ant in perspective with eclipse. I
downloaded elipse last evening (haven't yet installed it), but read the FAQ
to figure out just what it is, does and how. Yes, the FAQ actually taught me
all that. The FAQ mentioned ant, but I was then under the impression that
ant was another, competing, IDE. Now I understand that it ain't.

  How does HotSpot fit into this jigsaw puzzle? I know that hot spots aren't
good when my dogs get them, but apparently they're a Good Thing when
presented by Sun. Is HotSpot a java compiler that can be directed by either
ant or eclipse? I'm trying to understand a whole new system here and to see
the forest when now I see only the trees (and a bunch of Himalayan
blackberry vines along the way).

Thanks,

the Jar is usually the equivalent, but remember that the jar cannot be
run without a Java interpreter present (and in the path) on the target
machine. To compile to native bytecode, you'd have to use gcj, which is
rather alpha in development and may or may not compile your code.

How big is the application? How much code are you personally writing?
That determines how big the jar file is. If you write a little
application that primarily uses classes built into the standard Java
distribution, you don't have to include a lot in the jar. If you write
lots of stuff, it all goes in the jar, and the jar is quite big. You can
use multiple jars but then that becomes difficult to deal with on the
client machine where paths must be set up correctly.

netBeans works, but is very very very slow. I gave up on it because it
took way too long to load on even my newest machines. But it does work
just as well as any of the others.

Emacs is great for writing code, and it compiles stuff, and I might be
entirely wrong when I say this (ask Randal, as he probably knows a lot
more on this subject than I do), but emacs has little in the way of
project management stuff. The really nice thing about a good IDE is that
it can keep track of what files have changed and recompile them and only
them when you tell it to build the project, or it can clean all the
files and rebuild the whole thing.

open question: can emacs do that trivially?

Yes, because there aren't really any.

On the other hand, you will _never_ get the performance on a java app
that you would on a high-performanced compiled C/C++ app. Not even the
percentage increase for adding multiple processors that you would. Java
is no longer the lumbering beast of old days, but it's still no cheetah.

  I was advised to use eclipse. It's downloaded and installed but not
running. I believe it's a path problem as files are not found.

  OK. That makes very good sense. Java is ideal for my immediate need, but
for the larger, drainage basin integrated model, I'll stick with C and
FORTRAN.

Rich, for the standalone application you plan Eclipse is a very good
IDE. 

If you're concerned about the sizes of the bytecode, maybe Java is not
the way to go. 

The path problem is really not that complicated. Either your classes are
in the classpath or in any of the .jars that you added to your
classpath. Using Ant makes a lot of sense for more complex web
applications with templating, pattern stuff and deployment tasks. For
your standalone it would add unnecessary complexity. Just add all
referenced jars (if any) to the project's classpath in Eclipse (or a
shell script call of javac) and you're good to go. 

For me using an IDE like Eclipse is not a matter of taste or personal
opinion. I can code considerably faster with it and that is what counts.
There is also no programmer using objects and classes who wouldn't be
faster with a system that lists attributes and methods of used objects
while coding. 

For Rich's need IDEA could be an even better IDE, but this one is not
free.

      I was advised to use eclipse. It's downloaded and installed but not
    running. I believe it's a path problem as files are not found.

      OK. That makes very good sense. Java is ideal for my immediate need, but
    for the larger, drainage basin integrated model, I'll stick with C and
    FORTRAN.

LAMP == Linux Apache Mysql Perl/PHP

as long as everything is installed correctly, i don't see any reason why 
having the user jailed would make this a problem to implement.

Subject: [PLUG] PCI/AGP graphics board problem
Message-ID: <20030513211444.14052.qmail@station173.com>

Here's the short story.  I bought my PC 4 years ago with an AGP
graphics board and all was well.  That board started to flake on
me, so I bought another board and it was PCI.  Now my linux 
boot won't show up on my monitor.

Here's what happens.  I am doing a fresh install.  So I put the Suse 8.1
disk in the drive and reboot.  I get the initial screen where I get to 
choose what type of installation.  I make my choice, which does not
seem to affect the outcome, whether it's manual install, memory
test, text mode, etc.

The screen goes black and that's all I will see from then on.  Here's
the curious thing.  My windows install boots fine, graphics and
monitor wise, that is.

Anybody had this problem? and know a fix?  I am poor at the
moment and don't want to go buy another graphics board.

Thanks

Andy

I'm using vservers (http://www.solucorp.qc.ca/) on several different
systems.  Close to the ultimate jail and they don't really notice it.  
Root access in the vserver; add/remove software, users, etc.  And they can
be resposible for totally screwing up their own system without touching
anyone elses.

Don,

  I don't know for sure, but the fellow at Oregon Electronics (NE 10th and
Couch) has just about every kind of computer cable imaginable. He can also
make the rest. If he doesn't have them he'll probably know who does.

Subject: [PLUG] WMV Files
Message-ID: <1052833109.1163.20.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I have Mozilla 1.3 and Mplayer installed on my RedHat 8.0 system.  I can
play windows files fine if I play them from the hard drive, but when I
click a link to a wmv file in Mozilla, the file gets downloaded as a
text file (I just see a bunch of letters, numbers and symbols in the
browser screen).  This happens 99 out of 100 times.

Under preferences I have the following helper applications set up

MIME Type: video/mpeg
Extension: mpg, mpeg, wmv

MIME Type: video/quicktime
Extension: mov qt

MIME Type: video/x-msvideo
Extension: avi

MIME Type: video/x-ms-wmv  
Extension: wmv
***this is how the wmv files were set up under File Types and Programs

MIME Type: video/x-ms-wmv, video/mpeg
Extension: wmv
**** I'm not sure how this one got there?  But the problem happened even
before this one appeared.

Long story short, how do I get all wmv files to play with mplayer?

I seem to remember seeing them at Fry's.  Might try Oregon Electronic at 
503-239-5293 first.  They have all sorts of cable things and you don't 
have to deal with Fry's that way...

Check the BIOS and make sure you're choosing PCI instead of AGP.  Linux 
is probaly going by what the BIOS tells it, while the initial boot and 
windows maybe doing something else.

I'd actually like the file to play.  Is there any Mime Types I'm missing

Maybe your video card can't handle frame buffers (or something else that
linux is doing, but windows isn't), do you have an older install disk? 
It might get you to the point where you can compile your own kernel.

When you say 'rpm -e..' does nothing, what do you mean? 

What command line are you using, and what does it return? Show us what
you see on the screen. 

Try the following:

rpm -qa | grep MySQL

This should return the packages you listed above, nothing more, nothing
less.

If that is the case, then do this to remove all four packages:

rpm -e `rpm -qa | grep MySQL`

Note that those are backticks (usually a non-shifted tilde).

Let us know how it goes.

IIRC, the $0 and $@ syntax *IS* bash; the "exec" is performed by the shell, and
it simply calls the "wish" interpreter on the current script ($0) with the same
arguments ($@) you used.  The backslash on the previous line means nothing to
bash, but is understood by the TCL interpreter in wish as a line continuation,
and thus prevents it from reinvoking itself.

If it's sending you just plain text it's most likely that the server is
getting the mime-type wrong, and defaulting to "text/plain", in which
case there is very little that you can do about it, save for right
clicking and saying save-as, and sending the server admin an email
telling him he has his mime-types wrong.

If you're using rpm 4.1 (try "rpm --version"), you may have some stale
lockfiles. As root, do

  rm /var/lib/rpm/__db.*

> Try the following:

I'd change that just a bit:

  rpm -qa | grep -i mysql

The case-insensitive grep will pick up packages like php-mysql, 
mod_auth_mysql, etc. that might be dependent on the base MySQL rpms.

I have since tried this and the results are not different.  

I do have more info.  When I tried a fresh install of WinXP, I had similar
results, however somehow the XP figured out that I wasn't doing anything
as I sat with a blank screen, so after ~15 minutes a text version of the 
install popped up and I did the install until enough of the graphics were
installed and then I finished the install as If nothing was different.

I have an old Red Hat and I'll try that.

I can't remember for sure, but I have a vague recollection of a 
few (very few) early AGP motherboards where you had to choose 
between PCI or AGP with a jumper.

Roger that, the more I thought about it, the more obvious it became.  Wish

when I boot the system.  I get the line that says it had

Any ideas?

What motherboard do you have?
Does by any chance the video output appear on the builtin
graphics card when it disappears from the pci card?
Did disabling the AGP card in the bios change anything?

There was no builtin card, only the AGP card and I removed

  I have a similar problem with some junky servers I'm using.  The default RH versions 7.2 (ES), 8.0, and 9.0 video drivers don't recognize the on-board video chip in graphics mode.  They would only run in text mode.  I've installed old PCI S3 Virge boards to work around the problem.

  I also needed to configure the BIOS to initialize the PCI video first *and* custom select the SVGA driver during the RH installation.  

  Try selecting the SVGA driver.  The default RH installation was picking the wrong driver for the PCI card when I tried it.

I wouldn't hold your breath.  I'm currently trying to implement a LAMP 
system on a standard 20-bucks-a-year hosting service, and it's a total 
pain.  I had assumed that I would have development libraries and all that 
to compile against; but actually all I got was chroot and a gig of quota.  
And I got zero in the way of tools.  And although it's chroot, our user 
accounts cannot access the system directories -- only /home and /tmp.

So I ended up having to compile my own gcc, binutils, and glibc and upload 
it to the site just to get something workable so I can e.g. install 
imagemagick and some Perl modules.  This included manually modifying the 
gcc source code so that its output binaries would not link against 
/lib/ld-linux.so.2, but instead /home/blah/blah/lib/ld-linux.so.2.  Big 
PITA.

But it's doable, if you have enough disk space, I guess.

If you really need your very own system, you might want to consider one of 
the user-mode Linux hosting companies out there.  That way, you are root 
on your own (virtual) machine, but you don't have to pay for rack space 
and all that.

HTH.

Is the OS trying to start the X-server?  I see two possibilities here,
the first is that the RH installer changed kernels (or kernel settings)
and is implementing the frame buffers on the reboot.  The other
possibility is that the card is choking when the X-server loads.  More
information about the exact boot messages you can see would help narrow
it down.

Can you boot the RH rescue disk (use the old version)?  This might get
you back into a usable system, the fix though is going to be dependant
on what is causing the problem.

The screen goes blank long before it tries to start the
X-server.  When booting, I see the hardware booting screens
before any OS has started.  The instant that the Linux
kernel is booted (I am assuming) the screen goes blank,
so not Linux boot messages whatsoever.  It seems like
there should be a boot option that I need to be designating
that will tell any and all graphics messages to go to the
PCI graphics board instead of the AGP.

>> Can you boot the RH rescue disk (use the old version)?  

I haven't tried and to my memory I am never prompted to
make one.  I'll look further, but my sense is that it would
not work.

Thanks again for all your help.

I noticed this

   the nVidia driver needs an interrupt assigned to your graphics   
   adapter to work properly. make sure that you enable the 'assign IRQ to 
   vga' option in your BIOS (or however your BIOS calls it).

Does your bios have an assign IRQ to vga?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0305141434500.1426-100000@glenfiddich.cse.ogi.edu>

I've been tasked with scraping data from some off-site directories
and consolidating them in a locally accessible LDAP directory.

Lots of bash and perl later, I've got a 4.5MB LDIF file containing 
about 16,000 records that's ready for slurping.

Using ldapadd is painfully slow for a record set of that size, so I 
decided to use slapadd instead.

All my local filesystems are ext3 partitions. What became apparent
really quickly was that ext3 is ill-equipped to deal with the sort of
quick transactional writes done by the db libraries. It was almost
painful to watch.

tmpfs to the rescue!

  mount -t tmpfs -o defaults tmpfs /mnt/tmp

I used slapadd to transform the LDIF file into what became about 30MB 
of db data and indices.

  System 1: Red Hat 9, P3 550MHz, 128 MB RAM, IDE HD
  System 2: Red Hat 8, dual P3 1.2GHz, 512MB RAM, UltraSCSI 160 HD

Yep, looks like the kernel is being fed incorrect boot instructions.  If
there is no AGP device, then the kernel won't try to send information to
it.  My theory is that the kernel is putting the console into a mode
that your video card doesn't support, this was confirmed when you
successfully installed the old version of RH.  If this is the case, the
kernel is probably booting, and the OS is probably running; just not
capable of displaying anything.  Can you access it over the network?

Message-ID: <E19G4R4-0005vz-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

Hello,
I'm currently running debian unstable and have got almost all of my system configured except my usb wireless nic (prism2_usb module for a dwl-120 from dlink) and my soundcard (built into my MSI kt266pro2 motherboard).

So far I have my wireless adapter working as far as loading the modules and getting the hardware working,  my only problem is configuring it, I have it joined to my wlan and showing up in ifconfig as wlan0 with the correct ip address through dhcp but it just will not work correctly, if anyone can help me with a startup script for this device so that it will start at boot I would really appreciate it.

My second problem is with a via82cxxx_audio module. Whenever I modprobe the module for the device it says that it is not present, I'm trying to configure it with alsa. I apt installed alsaconf and it doesn't recognize the sound device either. If anyone has input on how to fix this, once again I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks for the help.

I can ping it on the network. .   I had some trouble loggin in, 
but I think that was a password problem.  I am reinstalling
and will know more later today.  But yes, the OS is running and
performing as expected.   Just not graphics since start of the

I'll keep an eye open this time, but don't remember one.

Hi, Max.  If you find a solution to your sound issue,
I'd like to hear about it.  I have the same
motherboard, and have tried OSS and ALSA, but have not
had the time to investigate it further.

Thanks.  And good luck!

You need to be more specific about what doesn't work, since it is
getting an address from your access point, something is working.

What does ifconfig show for wlan0?

What does iwconfig show?

What are the settings of your access point?

Are you trying to use WEP?

The setup for the wireless card is done in two places, /etc/modules
needs a line for the wireless card module (these get modprobe'd during
start up) and /etc/network/interfaces needs information about the wlan0
settings; man iwconfig for more information.

Try the AC97 module, it just might work (but might not - it doesn't hurt
to try though).

I have an msi 266 pro-r, the previous revision of this board with raid. It

currently have slackware 9.0 installed, with no sound and no gui. I have
previously used the alsa sound driver on this board with both slackware 8.1
and 9.0. I however have always downloaded alsa directly from the alsa
project page and configured it according to the directions there. The
onboard sound under linux the last time I tried the alsa driver sounds
pretty crappy though and you can actually hear the em interference when
other data is passing through the chipset and interfering with the sound
processing...such as when you move the mouse, transfer data on the pci
bus(such as through a nic) etc. The interference issue was never a problem
when I used the board under windows so it appears the linux driver has some
type of filtering issue and still needs some work to be done, but the sound
is usable and it does work using alsa. No need to purchase oss.

Additionally I forgot to mention you need to use the via 82xx module (for
the 8233, 8235,etc on these boards based on revision) in also NOT the 82cxxx
module you are attempting to use. The 82c is for things like the older via
686a, 686b, etc chipsets, not the newer 266, 266a, 333, etc. So your sound
probably isn't working because you are using the wrong module.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0305141306140.1426-100000@glenfiddich.cse.ogi.edu>

I've been tasked with scraping data from some off-site directories
and consolidating them in a locally accessible LDAP directory.

Lots of bash and perl later, I've got a 4.5MB LDIF file containing 
about 16,000 records that's ready for slurping.

Using ldapadd is painfully slow for a record set of that size, so I 
decided to use slapadd instead.

All my local filesystems are ext3 partitions. What became apparent
really quickly was that ext3 is ill-equipped to deal with the sort of
quick transactional writes done by the db libraries. It was almost
painful to watch.

tmpfs to the rescue!

  mount -t tmpfs -o defaults tmpfs /mnt/tmp

I used slapadd to transform the LDIF file into what became about 30MB 
of db data and indices.

  System 1: Red Hat 9, P3 550MHz, 128 MB RAM, IDE HD
  System 2: Red Hat 8, dual P3 1.2GHz, 512MB RAM, UltraSCSI 160 HD

Writing to a tmpfs partition:

  System 1           System 2
  -----------------  -----------------
  real    2m52.418s  real    0m50.038s

  sys     1m1.960s   sys     0m25.119s

Writing to an ext3 partition:

  System 1            System 2

  sys     1m26.860s   sys     0m32.426s

Obviously, a filesystem living in RAM is going to outperform one on

I always thought RAM was an order of magnitude faster than disks. Is that 
a bad assumption?

Have you thought about mounting the ext3 partitions in data=ordered or 
data=writeback modes? What about another filesystem? I've heard 
anecdotally that ReiserFS is fast for bazillions of small files.

You may just to do a little tuning ;-)

The problem you run into with ldapadd is that by default slapd calls
sync after each and every write.

If that is too paranoid for your needs, you can tell slapd only sync
every so often. I have mine configured to wait at least 2 seconds between
syncs and the write performance is several magnitudes faster. Here's the
magic in the database definition in slapd.conf:

	dbsync 2

I'm in the middle of something so I can't verify this, but if I remember
correctly slapadd calls sync fairly often as well. It may very well be
a disk subsystem issue rather than a file system issue.

Again from memory, I'm pretty sure it only takes a few minutes for me
to _ldapadd_ ~15,000 entries on my main box (1G PIII, 1G ram, U160SCSI)
which is formated with ext3.

I'll do some benchmarking later if I'm not too burned out after I finish
my current project ;-)

DDR @ 266 MHz peak bandwidth = 266 MHz * 8 bytes = 2.1 GB/s
Ultra 160 SCSI peak bandwidth = 80 MHz * 2 bytes = 160 MB/s

As a first approximation, I'd say your assumption is correct.  BTW, there's
no way a single disk could saturate an Ultra 160 bus unless the data
is coming from the disk's own cache.  The max transfer rate for a 15k rpm
disk is ~100 MB/s when actually reading data from the disk.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0305150657170.14271-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  As all of you are aware, I do not know perl, python or ruby. But, I have
been able to meet my modest needs over the past couple of decades using awk
and sed. Now I'm asking for some sage advice about framing a gawk program to
extract specific fields from a text file.

  Background: I extract certain records from jpilot as a
comma-separated-value (.csv) file. I want only a subset (name, title,
company, address) from the 24 fields there. My one-line gawk program works
just dandy if and only if there is no newline in a jpilot record. When there
is, the extracted file has a record distributed over two or more lines and
that screws up the gawk field extraction.

  There's a valid reason for the newline: some records have a mailing
address that differs from the street address. I use a slash and a newline in
jpilot for readability. I suppose I could use only the slash if I had to.
However, in the notes field, each contact has its own line and there's no
way I can concatenate those and still extract data properly for contact
information.

  So, my question to you more knowledgeble folks is this: Is there a way in
the gawk syntax to specify the field that begins a new record? That is, I
want to match a certain pattern before proceeding to the field extraction.
Would a BEGIN section be the way to go on this?

TIA,

Rich

I tested this on my "I/O challanged" laptop and it doesn't help.

Even turning syncing off completely, it still took 15 minutes.

With a tmpfs, it took 1 minute.


I'll try it with reiserfs, if I get a chance.

I don't know gawk, but I have a very old posting (1995) from Randal
Schwartz about a simple line continuation technique that you can
probably extend to your problem.

This is some pseudo code:

Get line from STDIN
Does line meet the end of line condition?
  No: Get another line and check again
  Yes: Process the line and then get another.

Here's some perl code:

LOOP: while (<>) {
  redo LOOP if s/\\$// and $_ .= <>;
}

that handles the standard Unix line continuation using \

I'm guessing that the gawk code may look similar, since it and perl
are cousins.  Siblings?

The gawk manpage says:

       RS          The input record separator, by default a  new?
                   line.

Good luck, and holler if you'd like some perl code to do it.

How Microsoft Warded Off Rival
By THOMAS FULLER
International Herald Tribune

RUSSELS, May 14 ? At least 90 percent of the world's personal computers
run on Windows software. But Microsoft wanted still more.

Last summer, Orlando Ayala, then in charge of worldwide sales at
Microsoft, sent an e-mail message titled Microsoft Confidential to
senior managers laying out a company strategy to dissuade governments
across the globe from choosing cheaper alternatives to the ubiquitous
Windows computer software systems.

Mr. Ayala's message told executives that if a deal involving governments
or large institutions looked doomed, they were authorized to draw from a
special fund to offer the software at a steep discount or even free if
necessary. Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, was sent a
copy of the e-mail message.

The memo on protecting sales of Windows and other desktop software
mentioned Linux, a still small but emerging software competitor that is
not owned by any specific company. "Under NO circumstances lose against
Linux," Mr. Ayala wrote.

This memo, as well as other e-mail messages and internal Microsoft
documents obtained from a recipient of the Microsoft e-mail, offers a
rare glimpse these days into the inner workings of Microsoft, the
world's largest software company. They spell out a program of tactics
that were carried out in recent years, ranging from steep price
discounts to Microsoft employees lying about their identities at trade
shows.

The Microsoft campaign against Linux raises questions about how much its
aggressive, take-no-prisoners corporate culture has changed, despite
having gone through a lengthy, reputation-tarnishing court battle in the
United States that resulted in Microsoft's being found to have
repeatedly violated antitrust laws.

Perhaps most important, certain discounts may run afoul of European
market regulators, who are still investigating accusations that
Microsoft abused their antitrust laws.

Discounting is a perfectly normal corporate practice. But under European
law, companies that hold a dominant market position like Microsoft are
prohibited from offering discounts that are aimed at blocking
competitors from the market. Microsoft has been concerned with the
legality of its discounts in the past, consulting a London law firm on a
specific discount plan in 1998, before it was determined in court that
the company had a monopoly in desktop operating systems.

In a telephone interview today, Jean-Philippe Courtois, the chairman of
Microsoft's operations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, defended
the use of the special fund described in Mr. Ayala's e-mail message,
saying it was part of a strategy to be "competitive" and "relevant" in
the market for big government and education deals.

"Linux is obviously a key competitor," Mr. Courtois said. Rivals use
similar tactics, he said.

Sun Microsystems, for example, "is giving away StarOffice to basically
governments and schools," he said. The Sun suite of programs runs on
both Windows and Linux operating systems.

Mr. Courtois said that Microsoft sometimes gave software to "very
low-income countries." He cited a program where Microsoft donated
software in South Africa and helped train teachers to use it.

Mr. Ayala's memo said that the discounts could be offered to "developed
and developing countries," and that an "initial focus" was being put on
Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, India and China.

In his e-mail message, he focused on governments and large institutions
buying mostly desktop software. A separate memo described a discounting
program for corporate customers worldwide.

Two days after Mr. Ayala sent his e-mail message, Michael Sinneck, the
executive in charge of Microsoft's services department, sent a message
giving details of a program to provide corporate clients with discounts
on the hourly rates charged by Microsoft's consulting business.

The memo said nearly $180 million had been allocated in the 2003 fiscal
year, which ends in June, for this purpose alone. Of that, $140 million
was earmarked for consulting services for server software, an area where
Microsoft has a growing share of the market but still faces lively
competition, particularly from big companies like I.B.M. that are
promoting Linux as an alternative to Microsoft Windows.

Servers are the powerful computers used by corporations to store data,
manage Web sites and perform other network tasks. The software that runs
servers is the subject of one of the two antitrust cases currently open
against Microsoft in the European Community. In broad terms, Microsoft
is accused of illegally leveraging its overwhelming dominance of the PC
software market into the server market.

European antitrust laws are generally stricter than comparable American
laws, but the Microsoft practices described in the memos may raise red
flags for regulators in the United States as well.

In June 2001, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that Microsoft
had violated antitrust laws by bullying business partners and rivals to
thwart any competitive challenge to Windows. Later that year, Microsoft
reached a settlement with the Bush administration, agreeing not to use
its monopoly power in PC software, including pricing deals and contract
terms, to effectively force PC makers to favor Microsoft products over
competing offerings.

Among the documents is an e-mail message from an outside lawyer, Bill
Allan of the London-based firm Linklaters, to Microsoft that offers a
precise interpretation of European Community law on the matter of
discounts, including the view that short-term discounting would be more
likely to escape scrutiny. The message, from 1998, advised Microsoft
that its discounts should not discriminate between clients and that
discounts could not be aimed at excluding competitors from the market.

"Discounts are not per se unlawful," Charles Stark, a former antitrust
official at the Justice Department and a partner at Wilmer, Cutler &
Pickering in Brussels, said in an interview. "It depends on the market
circumstances and how they use them and what their impact is."

Mr. Stark, who has not seen the documents, pointed out that under
European law "pricing behavior can be viewed differently by a dominant
firm than by a nondominant firm."

Asked whether the discounting program for server software consulting was
legal in Europe, given Microsoft's position, Mr. Courtois, the Microsoft
executive, said that consulting was a "break even" business.

"We are not a global services company," he said. "We need to compete
against the big guys."

Mr. Courtois cited I.B.M. and Oracle as companies with large consulting
businesses.

The Microsoft documents show the preoccupation among top managers with
countering the open-source movement, a group of programmers who want the
software that runs computers to be offered free of charge. The codes
behind open-source software are developed openly by independent teams of
programmers, allowing companies to customize their programs and paying
for services to make the software perform better. This is in stark
contrast to Microsoft, which keeps most of its source code secret ?
although governments and some corporations are increasingly allowed to
view the code.

Linux, the biggest open-source threat to Microsoft, has a tiny share of
the market for personal computer software. But Linux was installed in 26
percent of the large data-serving computers sold last year that power
corporate networks and the Internet, according to International Data, a
market research company. Microsoft's Windows was the operating system on
44 percent of the servers.

The server market is one area where Linux appears to have some momentum.
The use of Linux is also being supported by a handful of Microsoft
rivals and encouraged by many governments, especially in Europe, as a
cheaper and perhaps more secure alternative to Windows software. The
French, for example, have a Web site that recommends Linux systems for
government departments.

Mr. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, once referred to Linux's
licensing as "a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property
sense to everything it touches."

In the face of this competition, the Microsoft documents show the
significant resources the company devotes ? and the unconventional
tactics it sometimes uses ? to combat Linux.

Chris O'Rourke, a Microsoft employee, described attending LinuxWorld, a
trade fair in California, where he "purported to be an independent
computer consultant" working with several public school districts,
according to an e-mail message he sent on Aug. 20, 2002.

"In general, people bought this without question," Mr. O'Rourke wrote.
"Hook, line and sinker."

He said his goal was to glean intelligence about the competition. His
guise, Mr. O'Rourke said, "got folks to open up and talk." Mr. O'Rourke
did not respond to a fax and voice mail message seeking comment.

Another employee, Todd Brix, said in an e-mail message that he attended
a Linux conference in June 2001 in San Jose, Calif., pretending to be an
"ambivalent OEM." Original equipment manufacturers, or O.E.M.'s, are
companies like Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer that buy Windows
software licenses.

Reached at his office on Tuesday, Mr. Brix said that when attending such
a show, "you don't broadcast that you're a Microsoft person."

"You don't disguise that fact," he said. "You just don't lead with your
chin."

In his message, Mr. Brix described the technical issues discussed at the
show and said the tone of the meeting "was an even mix of Local Union
hall teamster gathering, Christian Scientist revival and Amway sales
conference."

Of all the Microsoft tactics described in the internal messages, the two
discount programs appear to be the most aggressive ? and perhaps the
most legally questionable.

Mr. Ayala sent his memo at 8:17 a.m. on July 16, 2002. In addition to
Mr. Ballmer, the recipients included two Microsoft vice presidents ?
James Allchin and Jeffrey S. Raikes ? along with some of the company's
top lawyers and the general managers of Microsoft's operations in Asia,
Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

Mr. Ayala wrote that in today's "difficult economic environment" some
institutions and companies were focusing on cheaper software."

"It is important," he continued, "that we have a way to address large PC
purchases that involve low-cost/no-cost competitors in the education
(and government) sectors, especially in emerging markets."

The solution, he wrote, was to "tip the scales" toward Microsoft in
these deals by using the special fund, which he called the Education and
Government Incentive Program.

The fund was to be used "only in deals we would lose otherwise," Mr.
Ayala said.

When he wrote the memo, Mr. Ayala was a quite high-level executive at
Microsoft, reporting directly to Mr. Ballmer. He was in charge of sales
and marketing and responsible for roughly 22,000 of the more than 50,000
Microsoft employees.

In March, Mr. Ayala was transferred to lead a new division that focuses
on small and medium-size companies. This new push is one of Microsoft's
top priorities. Mr. Ayala was not available to comment.

In his separate e-mail message, Mr. Sinneck, the Microsoft services
executive, wrote that the consulting fund would be used to cover the
difference between the "discounted customer rate and the standard
services billing rate per hour."

Reached this week, Larry Meadows, marketing manager for Microsoft's
services group at company headquarters in Redmond, Wash., said the fund
could be used "anywhere it needs to be."

"There's not really a limit to say that you can use it only in certain
geographies," Mr. Meadows added.

He said the funds would be used again in the next fiscal year that
begins in July.

Bonjour,

Normally I don't care what my SA-tagged messages look like because
usually, they're spam.  But sometimes a PLUG message gets tagged,  and
when it's a multipart message, it will often get mangled, as the example
below.  I'm wondering why that is, and how I can fix it.  Do I need to
disable my SPAM:-prefixed message altogether?

Merci bien,

--Jason V. C.


Example of SA-mangled message:

SPAM: Hi, this is Jason V. C.  I've installed a spam filter on my server,
SPAM: which has managed to identify this email as spam.  That's why the
SPAM: subject begins with "[spam]".  The idea is that you can now set up
SPAM: a single filtering rule in your email client such that, whenever
SPAM: it sees "[spam]" in the subject line, it would move the email into
SPAM: a separate spam folder, thereby getting it out of your face so you
SPAM: can read your REAL emails in peace.  You could also tell it to just
SPAM: delete the message, but I'm not sure I trust this spam filter that
SPAM: much.  It may be wiser to keep them around, and then scan through
SPAM: them every once in a while before deleting them, just in case
SPAM: there's something you actually want to read.
SPAM: 
SPAM: Anyway, I hope this makes your life a little better.  Email me if
SPAM: you've any questions, of course.  Just don't include a lot of HTML
SPAM: or special offers for penis enlargement, else (hopefully) it'll end
SPAM: up in my spam folder and I won't notice it!
SPAM: 
SPAM: The original message follows, if you want to look at it.  Cheers!

Very slick.  For a blast from the past, here's your original unmodified
from clp in 1995:

----------------------------------------------------------------

>From merlyn at stonehenge.comMon Nov 20 08:37:22 1995

I've written loops that look like:

	while (<>) {
		s/#.*//; # toss comments
		next if /^\s*$/; # skip blank lines
		redo if s/\\$// and $_ .= <>; # handle continuations
		...
		...
	}

and yes, the order of those three statements is very significant.
Work it out to see why.

----------------------------------------------------------------

I have to keep reminding myself to do an EOF check before the
end of the block so that it doesn't just keep reading and reading
and reading...

if you use the "report_safe 1" option spamassassin will attach the
original message to a generated spam report message, preserving it
instead of mangling the original message. Then, should something get
tagged as spam that isn't you still have an unmangled version of the
message, and any attachments to it.

Dear SCO Partner:

As a SCO Partner, we thank you for your support and continued business.
Because
you are a valued partner, it is important that we make you aware of
important
SCO business decisions and announcements as soon as possible. As such,
we wanted
to make you aware of an important announcement made today.

This communication is about recent efforts SCO has made to license and
protect
our patents, copyrights and intellectual property pertaining to the
UNIX(r)
operating system.  As you know, on March 7, 2003 SCO announced that it
filed
legal action against IBM in the State Court of Utah, for
misappropriation of
trade secrets, tortuous interference, unfair competition and breach of
contract.
The complaint alleged that IBM made concentrated efforts to improperly
destroy
the economic value of UNIX, particularly UNIX on Intel, to benefit IBM's
new
Linux services business.

As we have progressed in our discovery related to this action, SCO has
found
compelling evidence that the Linux operating system contains
unauthorized SCO
UNIX intellectual property (IP).  Due to this discovery, we are taking
three
immediate courses of action. 

1 - The first is to send a letter alerting commercial users to the fact
that
legal liability for the use of Linux by businesses may extend to end
users.
Customers should start receiving this letter today. For your
information, a copy
of this letter may be found at:
http://www.sco.com/scosource/letter_to_linux_customers.html

2 - The second action we are taking is to suspend all future sales of
the Linux
operating system from SCO until the attendant risks with Linux are
better
understood and properly resolved. 

3 - Finally, although this action affects future development and sales
of SCO's
Linux offerings, SCO will continue to support our SCO Linux and
OpenLinux
customers and partners who have previously implemented those products
and we
will hold them harmless from any SCO intellectual property issues
regarding
Linux. SCO will continue to honor all contractual obligations with
existing
customers including product updates, service, and support.

As many of you are already aware, SCO UNIX systems continue to sell well
-
including an increase in OpenServer sales over the previous quarter. Our
UNIX
products continue to support many of the world's largest businesses. In
addition, new customer sales indicate that there is still no better
option for
rock-solid, dependable technology for their core businesses than our SCO
UNIX
solutions.

We are excited to be building on our SCO UNIX history as we roll out our
next
generation UNIX operating system and SCOx framework this fall. SCOx will
allow
small and medium business customers and branch offices to plug their
existing
applications into a Web services environment. Details of this strategy
will be
unveiled at SCO Forum in Las Vegas, Nevada, August 17-19. (For more
details,
see: http://www.sco.com/2003forum ).

SCO remains committed to building new business opportunities for our
partners
such as you. We recognize that you have depended on us to provide
reliable,
solid technologies for your customers for over twenty years. We look
forward to
helping you and your customers meet your business needs for the next
twenty
years.

Sincerely,

Darl McBride
President and CEO
The SCO Group

Starting with SpamAssassin 2.50, the default behavior is to
include the suspected spam as an unmangled attachment. This
seems to be more reliable (and reversable) than the old SA
mark-up method. It looks like you're using SA version 2.44.
Any chance you can upgrade to the current 2.54?

Great, now FUD from SCO.

You'd think they would have learned. I really like this part:

"suspend all future sales of the Linux operating system from 
SCO until the attendant risks with Linux are better

SCO is very quickly alienating themselves from the Linux world.

So far, they have failed to produce any specific "infringing" code, and
other vendors have been forced to publicly reassure their customers that
may have received the SCO letter.

For example, RedHat:

-----
 "Given that we have extensive legal resources put forth into making sure
we respect the valid intellectual property rights of companies, we are not
concerned with the statements that have been made" that Unix code appears
in Linux, said Red Hat spokeswoman Leigh Day. "We do take intellectual
property very seriously."
----- (http://news.com.com/2100-1016_3-999371.html)

IBM, of course has flatly denied the charges
(http://news.com.com/2100-1016_3-999261.html?part=dtx&tag=ntop)

  SCO is doing the corporate equivalent of the guy who shots at cops so they
kill him in return. It's corporate suicide but leaves top management
blameless for the debacle. "Not my fault!"

I doubt it. So far it looks like a rowboat with a squirt gun taking on a
battleship. It takes some time for the crew of the battleship to realize
that they came under attack, and then the 18-inch guns take time to turn
around, but when they do ...

Eric Raymond and Rob Landley have written up a detailed response to the SCO

For  awhile I was thinking that maybe the best thing IBM could do was just
to buy out SCO to shut them up and stop the FUD.... but now I'm thinking
that would be much too good for them and their corporate officers.  Now
I'm hoping that IBM's legal department is able to stall the suit for years
and, in general, pull various legal manouvers designed to bleed SCO dry
drop by drop.  Let SCO twist in the wind.

If these SCOffers were actually morally indignant about the fact that
their code was stolen, they would produce the code and demand that it be
immediately removed - and, if such copied code actually existed, I'm sure the
Linux community would have it replaced in a few days.  Instead, SCO wants
to spread FUD while they play the lawyer game  telling everyone,
"the Linux Kernel contains code stolen from us!  We've been violated! But
we're not going to tell you what code was stolen!"  Kind of like reporting
your car stolen, but refusing to tell anyone what kind of car you had.

Probably, but the latest RPM for this distro (Drake 9) is still 2.44,
afaict. I'm trying to stick with binaries for this server, so I'd rather
just try that report_safe option than compile sa.  (Should know before
long whether that works.)

It's actually really easy to rebuild from the SRPM on the SpamAssassin
website.  You'll appreciate also being able to use Bayesian
classification and a much better ruleset.

Subject: [PLUG] Default gateway
Message-ID: <PCECIDMMGLFNFLCAPEAPKEONCIAA.mikel@quantecllc.com>

Hello, all.

This is my IP routing table. I want to add a net mask of 255.255.255.0 to
the default.

I can do a route add default quantec-gw netmask 255.255.255.0 but it adds
that to eth1 instead of eth0.
If I try to add it to eth0, it says Network is unreachable.

Now, do I *have* to have one on eth0? I don't think so, but I think it makes
it neater.

I'm obviously not very good at this so any help would be greatly
appreciated.

If you have any questions...

I don't understand whaty you're trying to do.  For one thing, it looks
like eth0 isn't really even configured, because it has no local network
associated.  For another, are you wanting to change the mask from
0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.0?  Don't do that, if so, because it's wrong. 
The default gateway should be 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 (run 'netstat -rn' and
you'll see that 'default' is really 0.0.0.0).

Actually I think they are practicing technology survival of the 90's.  How can 
we be bought by MS for millions of dollars.

What would MS do if it owned the rights to the Unix source and could pursue 
this claim?  They have deeper pockets than IBM.

On RedHat you could do this. Don't know about Mandrake.

rpm -hiv spamassassin-2.54-1.src.rpm
rpmbuild -bb /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/spamassassin.spec
rpm -hUv /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/spamassassin-2.54-1.rpm

I think he actually needs to install 'rpm-build' or whatever Mdk called
it.  Then should probably follow:

Isn't MS a major stockholder in SCO? Or was that a different *nix

No I don't believe that you must have an eth0. You can remove the NIC entirely. If

trick the kernel, but if you've got one NIC, it's eth0.

Chain of events:
MS licenses part of UNIX from ATT to create MS XENIX
MS sells rights to XENIX to SCO
 in exchange MS acquires part of SCO (at one point 15%)
ATT spins UNIX off to Unix System Labs
Unix Systems labs bought by Novell
Unix rights sold to SCO (in exchange Novell owns part of SCO)
SCO joins Linux International
Joint development of IA64 Unix started by SCO, IBM, HP, Intel
SCO sells most of company (Name, rights to UNIX, Unix related products) to
Caldera
Caldera changes names of products to Caldera Name
Caldera changes mind, Changes company name to SCO Group.
SCO Group goes nuts ...

Who can tell from here?

It would appear that no one here has an answer they would dare venture to

He's probably missing the rpm-build package, or whatever Mandrake

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0305160735250.18983-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Up until this morning I had opera-6.11 (static) installed and running
nicely on my RH 7.3 system. This morning it would not load and a check
showed that it was generating a segmentation fault.

  So I downloaded the newest, stable (6.12) rpm and freshened the
installation. Still seg faults. Ripped out the old version and installed the
new one. Same thing:

[rshepard at salmo ~/]$ opera
/usr/bin/opera: line 130: 19478 Segmentation fault      $OPERA "${@}"

  Yesterday I upgraded freetype, fontconfig and Xft. Could these have
anything to do with the problem? No, wait, that was Wednesday that I
upgraded those packages and opera worked just fine yesterday.

  I'm stumped and would like some suggestions from you what I could do to 1)
diagnose the cause of the problem and 2) get this app running again.

Many thanks,

Rich

serious need for these skills (about half the networks I've stumbled

Whether or not there is a market to justify the expense is debatable. 
Just because the need is there, doesn't mean there is work.

Well, let me state the entire problem.

We have two web servers - Apache on a Linux box and IIS on a Win2k server.

Real quick network setup: T1 -> firewall/router (Hawking) -> switch ->
network (which includes the web servers)

Each website has its own external IP and I have a DMZ on the firewall to
send the traffic to the approriate host.

Up until a couple of days ago, it all worked fine. On Wednesday, the
websites on the Apache server were no longer visible to the world. I had not
been working on the Linux box at all. From outside the network, I cannot see
the websites on the Linux box, but I *can* see the IIS server. If I move the
IIS box to a different DMZ IP, I can still see it. If I move any of the
Linux sites to a different IP I still cannot see them.

Inside the network everything works fine. I can ping the server and I can
get the web sites internally.

But I cannot get anything from outside the network and I am at a loss. I've
been working on this for a day and a half and I *need* to get this back up.

Any place that I can go to look would help immensly.

Thanks.

I don't understand whaty you're trying to do.  For one thing, it looks
like eth0 isn't really even configured, because it has no local network
associated.  For another, are you wanting to change the mask from
0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.0?  Don't do that, if so, because it's wrong.
The default gateway should be 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 (run 'netstat -rn' and
you'll see that 'default' is really 0.0.0.0).

Is there a potential change in the firewall? is the DMZ you moved it to on a 
different firewall? If you can reach it from inside but not out, that tells me 
that Apache is doing it's thing (like Linux does)

I'd suspect something on the outside of the apache box.

I thought so, too, but I hadn't made any changes to the Firewall either.
Could the firewall be going flaky? I dunno.
All the DMZs are based on that router, as its the only one we have. We have
no other firewall software running (that I'm aware of). I agree that Apache
is doing its thing, but I'm goin' bonkers trying to figure it out :)

Is there a potential change in the firewall? is the DMZ you moved it to on a
different firewall? If you can reach it from inside but not out, that tells
me
that Apache is doing it's thing (like Linux does)

I'd suspect something on the outside of the apache box.

Have you looked at the logs on the firewall?

Also do a netstat -an on the linux box and see if apache is listening to the
outside world. Something like this

tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN

Try tcptraceroute from the outside, it should let you know where the
packets are being dropped.  It does look like the firewall is causing
your grief, the packet trace should confirm (or deny) this theory.

Good Luck

As has already been pointed out, California Digital.  I've talked to
their lead sales guy and he says their parts are new even more
"standard" than what they made before and a bit more leading edge.  I've
got a reseller agreement (which was pretty informal) with them, but
unfortunately, they're only building rack gear, and most of my customers
are small businesses, and would prefer tower cases to rack.

Subject: [PLUG] SuSE FTP and DVD
Message-ID: <E19GkJb-0005p0-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>


The attached script will download the FTP version of SuSE and make 
a bootable DVD image. I tested the first version of this script with 8.1.      
I have
added more checks to the script and used it to on 8.2.	It should work with the
7 series as well but I haven't done so. 

You'll need  a mkisofs that will create large iso images. You'll need to
correct the paths for the programs used and paths of where to save the files.
You'll need 8 Gigs of free hard drive and hopefully a fast Internet connection.
I have in the past downloaded CD ISOs via a 26400 baud modem, so it should be
possible to download the 3+ Gigs over a modem.You'll need a DVD burner to make
the bootable DVD.

The script works in the following steps:
1.) Ping a group of SuSE mirrors to find the closest one.
2.) Verify the version of SuSE wanted is on the server.
3.) Mirror the SuSE version wanted minus the source. 3858 Mb
4.) SuSE doesn't have md5sums for all the files in all the directories. The
script checks the
downloaded file sizes against the file sizes on the mirror. It will download
any
files again, if the sizes vary. 
5.) Verify the md5 sums of the files that do have sums. It will download the
files
again, if the sums aren't correct.
6.) Create a bootable DVD ISO image.

You can now burn the image to a DVD. 

I have been working on this as I was mirroring the ftp server. I think I have
the script in workable order, but there are no guarantees. Use at your own
risk. I will not be around next week so any posts about it not working will not
be answered until I get back. I would like to hear if you use the script and
have problems. 

I'm unemployed at the moment and when I have the cash I will buy a box set. I
don't feel morally repugnant because I am leaching. I think that free as in
beer is a good thing, but it is nice to use your money to support a product you
like. If I was loaded, I'd buy, but right now I'm hurting.  

Thank you
Russell

Thanks. I do the tracert from a gateway, and I get similar results. I think
our router is the next stop, but I'm not real sure. It's not responding to
anything from outside. Not pings, tracerts. No-thing...

But from the inside, all traffic goes just hunky.

I had a similar-sounding segfault problem with Opera 6 after I updated
XFree.

Deleting ~/.fonts.cache-1 fixed it in a flash.

If that doesn't work, I'd also try renaming/moving ~/.opera/opera6.ini 

HTH,

  Bingo! Jackpot! That was it.

  There are so many possibilities that I forget to remove the config files
when things fail.

Or is it inn sucks!

Man what a pain.  We're trying to get a small news feed going and feed it 
back up stream.   We're registered to use teranews.com but can't quite 
figure out all the fiddlely bits.  All searches have been almost useful 
but nothing has 'really' covered the process.

Is there a book or site that really covers using inn and suck.  Or perhaps
someone on the list has consumed the required quantites of fermented
juices and succeeded in getting this pair to work together?

I think there's an O'Reilly book which covers INN; ah, here it is:

Heh.  I went back to see it again, and there's a good bit more than just 
that screenshot.  I'd say there's a full five seconds of seeing her 
diddle with a root prompt.

Also, she's using nmap and IPv4 and NAT.  I guess that settles this whole 
IPv6 migration business.

I've seen that doing LVS.  Possibly, your load balancer NATs the dest 
address to your web server (that's how LVS works at least).  So the web 
server sees a packet from BFE, and it needs a default gateway.  That 
should be the load balancer, which has been dilligently keeping track of 
this in-progress request. If we screw up the default route of the web 
server, accessing it from the LAN will work, but coming from outside 
won't.

> route add default quantec-gw netmask 255.255.255.0

Huh?  And why bother with eth0?  Maybe I misunderstand, but don't you just 
want that linux machine using your load balancer as the gateway.  Then...
  # route add default gw quantec-gw
is all you need, right?  (I didn't see the 'gw' in your command, and why 
use a netmask?)

Another option is to just not use inn.

I've personally found it easier to use nntpcache (www.nntpcache.org).  
It's basically a proxy server. You tell it about whatever nntp servers
you access.  Then it transparently makes them look like they're local.  
It caches locally articles from groups that are actually read locally.

Thanks Dave.  I'll look at this option.  I knew that had to be a better 
and probably nore modern way to do it.  :-)

Message-ID: <20030517125636.55fb4ee5.jason@vancleve.com>

Here's another interesting problem:  I want to know when certain people
email me, and since I'm usually working in a different workspace from my
email client, I'd like to play a WAV when it happens.  The client is
Sylpheed, whose "Filter setting" interface has no way of running
arbitrary commands. Besides that, Sylpheed is rather hard on my
resources when it checks mail, so I don't let it do so automatically.

What I'd really prefer is to configure Postfix, over on my server, to
pick out the emails and take some action which my workstation would then
notice based on a cron task run every few minutes.  That would play me
the WAV, and I could then go to Sylpheed and grab the message.  I don't
know how that could work, but I'm thinking there's gotta a clever way to
pull it off.  I mean, how do Linux hosts normally notify each other of
things?  I supposed I could do something with apache or my FTP service,
but that seems kludgy.  Any ideas on this?

Jason,

  I wonder how long it will take you to memorize the song for each person
sending you a message. Have you selected the tune for spam yet?

  Why not do this with procmail? Since you can sort incoming messages to
different files I suppose that you could have it sing to you, too, while
it's doing so.

Great, except procmail frightens me.  This is fear of the unknown, since
I can't find the docs online anywhere, so I don't know how it works or
even what it does exactly.  I'm always reluctant to install things just
to read the man pages.  Can someone toss me a link?  (None of the FAQs
explain how procmail works.)

Subject: [PLUG] debian, x11, and nvidia geforce 2.
Message-ID: <E19HEDU-00082J-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

I brought my computer to the Linux clinic today, and was working on installing 
Debian over my Slackware. It appears to have come out just fine; when I left, 
I was having a hard time with the nvidia drivers. I resolved those problems 
(apparently I was missing some dependencies), and now it boots X just fine. I 
got the usb mouse working, even scrolling (which is a step up from before). 

My problems that remain: 

I'm not getting audio from within kde; some error comes up about a 
nonexistant "/dev/dsp." I didn't try playing sounds from the command line. 
It's probably fairly simply solvable. I'll nail it down.

The other problem has to do with KDE. When I boot into KDE, if I'm using a 
mode that's greater than 800x600, I get a huge "virtual desktop" that slides 
around as I hit the edges of the screen with the mouse.  I remember having 
this problem with a previous incarnation of KDE/X11 but I don't recall the 
solution. If you can help, that's great; but I had a whole bunch of help at 
the clinic (the suggestion of "is the nvidia driver installed" was a big key).

here's my current xf86config-4 file.

The links are easy to find:

http://viaverio.com/support/virtual/email/procmail/docs/procmail.1.html
http://viaverio.com/support/virtual/email/procmail/docs/procmailex.5.html
http://viaverio.com/support/virtual/email/procmail/docs/procmailrc.5.html

Chances are, if the man pages don't help you, then you don't want to 
use procmail. There's a picture of the procmail code in the dictionary 
next to the word "spaghetti." :-)

BTW, what distro are you using that doesn't include procmail as a 
default installation package?

LFS.  The server is Drake 9.something, but I'm assuming I'll want to use
procmail on my desktop.  Thanks for the links, I'm looking into this.

Change the order of the "modes".  The X-server will size to the biggest
screen (or highest resolution) listed in the modes section, but will
default to the resolution listed first in the "modes" section.  Your
X-server is starting with a screen size of 1280x1024, but only
displaying a 640x480 chunk of it.

Use <ctrl><alt><keypad +>

or <ctrl><alt><keypad ->

to change the resolution.

To change the screen size, delete or add entries.  To change the order
of resolution cycling, including the default, left to right will the 
<keypad +>, with the left most being the default.

Restart the X-server after each change (no need to reboot).

Use <ctrl><alt><backspace>

to kill the X-server, and "/etc/init.d/kdm stop" as root to kill the KDE
display manager.  The command "startx" will start the X-server again,
without the kdm.

Good Luck,

Message-ID: <86ptmgbt2v.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I just happened across a reference that might be relevant to the
problem that Galen and ??? were working on this afternoon at the
clinic.  From:
 
  <http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-x86-install.xml>

  Important: If you are installing Gentoo Linux on a system with an
  NVIDIA nForce or nForce2 chipset with an integrated GeForce graphics
  card, you should use LILO and avoid GRUB. With on-board video
  enabled, the low memory area of your RAM may be used as video
  RAM. Since GRUB also uses low memory at boot time, it may experience
  an "out of memory" condition. So, if you have an nForce or
  potentially other board with on-board video, use LILO. Even if
  you're using off-board video right now, it would be nice to be able
  to remove the graphics card and use the on-board video in a pinch,
  wouldn't it? :)

Maybe that explains what we were seeing.  I actually like GRUB much
better than LILO, but maybe it's worth trying.

IIRC, Ethan was his name.

I think I just stumbled onto the answer.  Apparently there are instances
with nvidia cards where the Primary VGA BIOS setting (AGP or PCI) is
important.  This discussion from the Linux Gazette pretty much describes
today's problem.

http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue86/tag/1.html

I bet a newer kernel might fix this problem as well, but I would 
definitely try changing the BIOS setting first.

Ethan, if you are out there, please let us know if this fixes the problem.

You probably need to load your sound card drivers, but first try
playing something from the command line (prefferably with out kde
running, so arts dosen't interfere with your testing). 

In debian, by default you have to be in the "audio" group to access
/dev/dsp, so if you eventually get permission errors ("cannot open
/dev/dsp ...") this is probably the problem, note that you have to
logout (well, login) after adding your user to a group for that to
take effect.

That's not unusual; it just indicates a (usually) temporary failure in
DNS resolution.

Usually this is just someone using his domain name, but not actually
going through your or his server.  There's no way to stop it.  Something
related is what's called a "Joe job".  Check Google for info.

But should they even be something that is being trying to be resolved?  Is
it something on the return email that is trying to resolve?  That would
make sense. I would have thought that postfix would have only tried to
resolve names on sending?  Does it try on the return and recieved emails
as well?

Thanks.  I knew that was possible.  I just wanted to check to make sure
there is nothing I had configured wrong.  Never heard it called a "Joe
Job" but will look for that.

Hey,

I have been running a problem around in my head for a little while and I
was wondering if I could get some feedback from the list.

The Problem
-----------
I would like a way to access several remote files (resume, cover letter,
.vimrc, etc) in a transparent and very easy way.  Preferrably as a
seperate drive in windows or as a mount point in Linux.  I would like to
read,edit/update or add new files quickly and easily.  So far, when I
have needed to access these files I have been on broadband connections,
so throughput usually isn't a problem.  


The Solution
------------
Use Samba over a port forwarded SSH connection.  Unfortunately, I'm not
sure how safe Samba on the Internet is, even over an SSH connection. I
was planning on using ssh keys, rather then a password, since from what
I understand this is more secure then passing the encrypted password. 

I have thought about using FTP, but I would like to maintain a
persistent connection throughout an 8-hour day, and I would like to keep
all the files in one location, rather then download them, edit them, and
re-upload them.  

I have thought about using CVS, but it isn't as natural as having a
mount point and requires extra software installs on most windows
machines.


The Questions
-------------
Is samba safe enough?  I know nothing is ever completely "safe", but
using ssh should be as secure as making an ssh connection to another
server, which I am willing to accept as "secure-enough".

I haven't done much ssh port forwarding before and I was wondering if I
could get an abstraction of this problem.  For example, would I be
connecting to port 137 on the remote machine, or would I use port 22? 
I'm a little unclear on how port forwarding works.  

Has anyone done anything similar to this before?  How did you approach
this problem?


My network
----------

the Internet comes in as Comcast broadband, which goes through a router
running freesco.  

Freesco allows me to forward ports from the internet to local machines,
so I will forward the required port to my 700mhz RH9 machine.  

RH9 runs samba and openssh, and should handle all the connections.

Thanks

You may want to look into using webdav as a solution.  You can configure
Apache to be a webdav server and both windows and linux have webdav
clients that can connect to a webdav server.  I have a webdav on Apache
and from window clients you just create a "web folder" or "network place"
depending on version of windows.

you can then use the SSL https connetion in your apache to do the
encryption. The downside is that the webdav connection is not a persistant
connection.  It just send extended HTTP methods to put and get files from
the server.  Works will for me when I want to get and edit files on a
server.  This also gives all clients a way to access remote files.

How about just ssh to the machine and use vi or emacs to edit the files?

If you still want to do the samba port forwarding, you might find this helpful

As much as I like to use vim for as many things as I can, some of the
files (resume, cover letter) are stored (currently) as OpenOffice
documents, and I export them to .pdf.  In either case, I have documents
that have embedded formatting and, unfortunately, can't be edited by
simple text editors.

Thanks, that looks like it will be a big help, if I decide to go that
route.

Yes, but that's not what you're seeing.  The deferred queue is for
messages being sent out that cannot be delivered immediately (temporary
DNS failure is a common reason).

Well, check your logs, or use pflogsumm.  If you have a sufficiently
limited number of users, it should be obvious whether it's been
inappropriately used.  I hadn't heard it called a "Joe job" until I was
looking over some of my logs and noticed a reject of a bounce to a
particular address.

Thanks for the perl script that helps.  But....

It looks like my postfix server is sending under bad names.  I'm still
trying to figure out the entire log thing but it is giving odd names as
people trying to send email.  And I know who would be trying in most
cases.  So...

How do I know if this is relay or some program has compromised the system?
 I'm trying to see what happened if anything.  But first glance does not
give me that warm fuzzy feeling inside.  :-(

  I'm looking for some assistance in getting my cell phone (Kyocera
QCP-6035) working as a modem with my notebook computer. Conceptually, I can
tie the two together with a serial card in the notebook and the adapter cord
for the Kyocera. But, I cannot work out the configuration string or whatever
else is preventing me from succesfully connecting to my shell account at my
ISP. The connection is made, then the far side immediately hangs up.

  We have a bunch of TelCo- and wireless-aware folks here so I'm hoping that
I can get some assistance so this works.

works great on x86 boxes but i have been having some issues getting it to 
compile correctly under the darwin environment. it is a kde based program so 
if you don't use kde, you need the libraries for it.

Chris,

  I was guided to <http://www.gentleware.com/>. Their "community edition" of
Poseidon for UML is free and installed on my RH 7.3 box with no problems.

  I'm more interested in gaining some experience with the design and
analysis process using UML.

OK, I'm first at this message today so I'll ask all the lame questions.

Have you tried this will a normal land-line modem to make sure you really 
can log into your ISPs system.

What is the OS on the laptop?  Just in case you've got an old one.

Typical problems I've seen:
	1) You don't really have a shell account/logon.
	2) Forgot the @isp.com at the end of your logon if your ISP offers 
	   national dialup.
	3) You got WINS resolution enabled if you're stuck using a certain 
	   'other' popular OS.

One last thought is if there is a special command to get a shell logon 
process instead of using a PAP/CHAP to get PPP.

  Yup. I used to use the pcmcia modem to dial in via a landline. However,
that costs money while using my cell phone within the 12 western states is
all part of the monthly rate.

  Slackware-9.0; used to be Red Hat 6.2.

  N/A. See answer to #0 above.

  The only OS popular here for the past half-dozen years is linux.

  I'm using the same scripts I used with the pcmcia modem.

  I suspect the problem is with the 'network' setup on the Kyocera. Neither
they nor Verizon Wireless have a clue about linux (at least, not
officially).

well, i can give you a link to the book that i learned uml from:

http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=2XBI7X9YF0&isbn=020165783X&TXT=Y&itm=1

it's called uml distilled and for being a rather small book, was pretty 
thourogh. hope that is of some help.

I've never used UML, but I'm curious: what is the appeal of UML?

It kind of seems like flowcharts for OO design - who uses flowcharts
anymore?  Also, in the hardware design world schematics used to be used to
graphically represent a design, but very few engineers use schematics
anymore.  Most hardware design is now done with HDLs (Hardware Description
Languages).  It's very cumbersome to design with schmatics - it is a lot
easier to design with HDLs (and HDLs allow you to design at much higher
levels of abstraction).  So in the hardware world they've gone the
opposite direction away from the graphical design representation toward
textual representation.

I'm not trying to dis UML.  I don't know much about it, but given past
trends in both software and hardware design, I haven't seen any compelling
reasons to learn it.

Also, after you've got a UML diagram, it's not executable is it?
Personally, I think that if you're working in one of the agile languages
like Ruby, Python, SmallTalk or Lisp/Scheme that UML offers very little
because it's so easy to change your design in those languages.
Perhaps it offers more to users of statically typed languages like C++ or
Java.  I've use Ruby as a prototyping language for C++.  Think of
Ruby/Python/Lisp/Scheme as modelling clay that you use to get the OO
aspects of your design figured out before you move to marble (C++).
I also used a 'test first' approach such that the Unit tests were written
in Ruby but (by using swig) the same unit tests were used to test the C++
classes.

Don't know if it has been mentioned already, but Dia has support for UML
and there are even tools for going from Dia -> code and from code -> Dia
UML diagrams out there. (google for dia2code and AutoDia, for the
curious)

Keep in mind that pflogsumm lists "senders" from both incoming and
outgoing messages. You'll see in the "senders" list, most every address
anyone receives mail from.

At least, that seems to be the default, and I haven't investigated if it
can be changed.

uml is used to diagram the solution to a problem. the software program i am in 
uses uml a lot. we use uml to make design object model diagrams that we then 
write algorithms for. it works well for laying out the solution and having a 
visual feel of what objects are where and how communication takes place 
between them. having used uml, i don't think i would ever try to approach an 
object oriented solution without using it.

  As a complete tyro I'll take a shot at answering your questions. The
appeal that I have discovered is being able to describe the requirements,
interfaces, design and code of your project (primarily software but
apparently anything) in a standardized way and even generate correct code as
a result.

  UML is a meld of the design approaches created and promoted by Grady
Booch, Jim Rumbaugh and Ivar Jacobson. They were all enticed into working at
Rational Software where they were apparently locked in a room and not let
out until they put together their different ideas. UML is now owned by the
Object Management Group (OMG) (http://www.omg.org/).

  There are many different views available under UML. One set (structured
diagrams) includes Class Diagrams, Object Diagrams, Component Diagrams and
Deployment Diagrams. Another set is the Behavior Diagrams and includes Use
Case Diagrams, Activity Diagrams, Collaboration Diagrams and Statechart
Diagrams. The third set is Model Management Diagrams and is similar to the
old flow charts as it includes Packages, Subsystems and Models.

  The Use Case Diagram took me a bit to understand, but makes a lot of sense
when we do understand it. In UML there are 'actors' or 'roles' (equivalent
terms) which are people or other software that interact with the software
being designed. You build the diagram by asking, "Who will use this
component?" and "How will it be used?". Good for defining requirements and
designing the UI.

  By looking at the project from a bunch of different perspectives (also by
different people or groups when that's appropriate) there is an increased
probability that you have all the needs identified before you start coding.
The different diagrams then can be used to identify the appropriate classes,
each with the proper attributes (variables) and methods (functions).

  As I read about UML this weekend I kept thinking of the Portland Water
Bureau's software debacle and how a comprehensive UML analysis might have
avoided the mess. As a graphical method that can capture _all_ aspects of
the software in a way understandable to both the technical and non-technical
folks it should be appropriate to every large project and certainly can be
used in teeny projects such as my modeling system.
  
> Also, after you've got a UML diagram, it's not executable is it?

  Nope. But, depending on the tool you use you can generate correct code
that _is_ executable. The Poseidon for UML tool I referenced will generate
java, C++ and -- IIRC -- one other flavor of code. It ain't complete but
close enough that even simple fools like me can fill in the blanks.

  It's easy to change the design in _any_ language. The problem, I believe,
is in creating the design in the first place so that it includes everything.
I know that I've coded projects (in C) and discovered that there was
something I needed but hadn't thought of in advance.

I've looked at it and kinda tried to use it, but haven't really had
enough time to use it effectively.  First, for purely documentation
purposes--it's nice to be able to represent the relationships between
classes, as a deliverable to a customer that they can mostly understand
(even if they don't understand all the details) and that they can be
confident other programmers can understand.

The second is to be able to get a view of your design in a more succint
manner, which *might* make it easier to think about your design.  I
don't know if this promise really pays off or if you end up with
anything better than you'd get with boxes on a piece of paper, but at
least you end up with something that can go into the documentation.  I
don't do as much OO as I'd like (or as much programming in general), but
I find myself sometimes struggling with the abstraction, and find
pictures help.

Personally, the main problem with charting software I've found is that
it is awkward to use.  Something like a tablet or a pressure-sensing
screen for manipulation these things on the screen sounds much more
natural to me than a mouse, and being able to draw in more of a raster
fashion instead of vector definitely would be an improvement.  It seems
that whenever I do try to diagram, I spend most of my time getting
variously shaped lines to connect correctly with boxes, and getting the
boxes to line up...

> It kind of seems like flowcharts for OO design - who uses flowcharts

*Raises hand*  Customers like things they can understand, and it's
easier for non-technical people (or people whose tech skills lie in
other domains) to understand pictures.  And sometimes it's easier to
feel like you're not working by drawing pictures...

> It's very cumbersome to design with schmatics

I don't doubt that the detailed design is, but I wonder how many of the
higher-level designs are sketched out on a napkin or notebook to start
out?  And when it comes down to produce documentation, I'm guessing that
HDL gets turned into a diagram, no?

Something I know! Something I know! (Well, sort of.) We've been working 
on this at my house over the last week or so, because once we both can 
fax from the cell phones we're axing the landline. So here's what I'd 
recommend:

Their website is not a lot of help, and as I looked to find the page 
you might want, I see they've changed it so the info I was going to 
recommend is not there. I did find a site, 
http://homepage.mac.com/jrc/contrib/mobile_office/ which is about 
connecting with os x, and guess who sent him info on working it out? 
Our very own Randal had this to say:

"Randal" == Randal L Schwartz <merlyn at stonehenge.com> writes:

Randal> I was able to use VZW_STD with #777, qnc/qnc to connect at 
14.4.  But
Randal> I couldn't get any of the other three scripts to work.  How do

How?

And, when I looked further, I saw that the answer was to use

         user myphonenumber at vzw3g.com, password vzw, phone #777
         with the VZW_1X_ON_115200 script

And it works fine.  I've got a low-speed connect with VZW_STD when
I'm in QNC territory, and high-speed (cough!) connect when in "3G" 
areas.

Thanks for your help.  And thank google for being able to peer inside
a PDF. :)
----------

Now, this is from 11/02, so I don' t know if it will help you out or 
not. I also found that on the maccellphone group there is a message at 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/maccellphone/message/540 that seems to 
have the lowdown (it's not a kyocera specific message but it might 
help), and that from the bit of info I have been able to unearth, 
people have done this with a kyocera, and if it will work with os x 
then it should be easy to make those directions work for you.

I really hope this is helpful, I was real excited to see a question I 
might actually have an answer for. Good luck!

Lest people get the wrong impression, I'm sure what you meant to say is
that most engineers use HDLs when designing integrated circuits and
programmable logic.  On the other hand, schematics are almost universally
used to describe printed circuit board designs.

I was given a HP7585B plotter.  It makes large pen plots.  

The problem is when turned on, it gives a ROM checksum error.

Any ideas where to get a new ROM burned or a replacement ROM?  HP's
website shows everything discontinued.  Calling HP is futile, at least
to the support line.  I get voice actuated helpless help. 

Here's a picture of the ROM

Worse news: it might not be the ROM image; it might be the plotter's CPU
that's gone marginal.

I'll add one more problem with graphical design tools, including schematics.
The absence of useful equivalents to 'diff -u old new'.  It's hard to
diff schematics.  You can diff the output netlist, but there are 
definitely problems associated with that.  Also, the absence of
useful diffs makes version control a pain.

Exactly the same kinds of problems that hardware designers ran into with
schematics and one reason why they're not used so much anymore.

No.  HDL gets synthesized into hardware - that's easy to say, of course,
there's a lot involved in synthesis that I probably shouldn't go into
here, but think of synthesis as the compiler that compiles into equations
and RTL which gets mapped into hardware.  Diagrams and pictures are
difficult for computers to deal with, text is much easier.

As the industry moved from Schematics to HDLs there was some mixed
development done where some parts of the system were drawn as schematics
and others were described with HDLs, but that isn't done so much anymore.
Now the main place where diagrams are still used by some hardware
designers is to
connect blocks (which represent HDL code) together at the top level - it
can sometimes be easier to make all the connections graphically, rather
than typing it all in.  But for the most part we discovered in the
hardware world that graphical representations of designs just don't work
as well as textual descriptions of what the design should do.  So that's
why I'm suspicious that UML will be a short-lived fad.  UML just reminds
me of schematics, I guess, and I'd rather not go back there.

I have this suspicion that if you feel that you need UML diagrams that
you need to be programming at a higher-level of abstraction.

True.  It's been years since I worked on circuit boards.

Diagrams are good for showing how components connect together (as is the
case for circuit boards), but I don't think they're so good at describing
behavior (as is the case at the chip level).

Subject: [PLUG] DNS interest...
Message-ID: <1053370832.23384.20.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

So I can change the origin directive in a dns zone file to set up
a subdomain.  I wonder if this is how you host different domains
then the one your nameserver is set up on to provide backup dns?

Another interesting problem that comes up is when you use dns for
your private lan;  It seems I have to use a use a registered name
since I'm connected to the Internet so I use the same one I use
on the outside.  Question is, is there a trick in DNS to fix it
so that I can use any local domain name that is not used on the
Internet and manage to make the dns smart enough to not look for 
that particular domain out on the net when it doesn't find it in my
local nameserver without breaking the behavior of looking for other
names out on the net?  There are reserved numbers for private networks, 
how about reserved domain names?  It's quite odd to have the same
hostname for multiple interfaces on a single box but then again
maybe this is correct.  I currently don't put outside number entries
for hosts I have an internal number for into my internal dns thinking
that this will prevent taking a public route to that box from inside
my private network, since there are two machines that can go out I
don't want to create a loop. 

I'm using the trick of binding a name server to an interface so that
my public servers are bound to my outside interface and cannot be
used by my private network whereas my private servers are bound to
my inside interface and cannot be queried by Internet hosts.  It's
somewhat awkward to have to put entries for some public hosts in my 
private name servers to be able to look them up from lan 
though.  I have two numbers reserved in my public ip block for
putting machines in front of my lan servers, equivalent of a direct
connection wthout an intervening firewall box.

Perhaps, relative to changing a piece of hardware.  However, it's much
easier to change your design in a dynamically typed language than in a
statically typed one.  So let's say your change leads to needing to change
the type of an argument that shows up in a hundred or so function
declarations - not fun.  In a dynamically typed language there's no issue.

Check out this article by Paul Graham:

"Why Hacking is like Painting"
http://paulgraham.com/hp.html

Key quote:

"A good programming language should, like oil paint, make it easy
to change your mind. Dynamic typing is a win here because you don't have
to commit to specific data representations up front. But the key to
flexibility, I think, is to make the language very abstract. The easiest
program to change is one that's very short."

MICROSOFT SCOOPS UP UNIX LICENSE FROM SCO
Microsoft is buying the rights to SCO Group's Unix technology for an
undisclosed amount, in a move that will bolster SCO's controversial
campaign to demand royalties from users of the Linux operating software,
which SCO claims infringes on its Unix patents. Linux supporters have
demanded that SCO identify which parts of the code are duplicative, but SCO
says that doing that would allow programmers to cover up their
transgressions by rewriting the software. "That's like saying, 'show us the
fingerprints on the gun so you can rub them off,'" says SCO CEO Darl
McBride. Microsoft, which competes fiercely with both Linux and Unix, at
the same time has been a long-time backer of SCO and some in the Linux
community have speculated the software giant is secretly bankrolling SCO's
litigation to reduce the Linux threat. A Microsoft spokeswoman denied that
rumor. (Wall Street Journal 19 May 2003)

I saw it on /.; I didn't read carefully, but I got the impression they
had licensed their IP (in the same way the Sun, IBM, HP et al do), not
purchased it outright.  I'm guessing purchasing it outright would have
been subject to vigorous anti-trust opposition, since some of
Microsoft's main competition relies on their SysV licenses.

  Exactly where a UML-enabled tool like Poseidon or Rational Rose comes in
handy. Pull up the class diagram. Change the type of a variable (or the
argument for a method) and the change is automagically made every place in
the model. Of course, I'm not a professional designer of either hardware or
software but it seems simple to me.

  Tell you what, Phil. Stick with what makes you comfortable. You asked
about UML because you knew nothing about it. If you want to trash it and

Perhaps, but who's in charge of Justice Department these days?  I don't

Interesting.  So this tends to bolster my argument that UML isn't as
neccessary for development in dynamically typed languages.

No, I'm not trying to trash it.  I'm trying to find out why people use it.

For me it seems like a step in the wrong direction, but if I can
understand why people choose to use it maybe I can understand why people
want to go that way and then offer them alternatives ;-)  I really do
think there might be better methodologies....

To me -- and I'll admit to being perhaps a bit idiosyncratic on this
particular issue -- it's problematic anytime you can't store 
information with diffs or some sort of version control.

Sometimes, this can't be helped or can only be done with lots of 
effort, like when the data have to be stored in an RDBMS.

This is my big hangup moving to an LDAP-based authentication system. 
NIS, for all its warts, is supported by ascii config files, which can 
be stored in RCS. OK, the passwd map has trouble in that regard 
because users need to be able to changes passwords and shells -- but 
the other important maps can all be kept in RCS: group, netgroup, 
networks, services, ...

IOW, you've got a decent audit trail and you can easily back out of 
any disasterous updates.

Is there a decent versioning system for LDAP maps?

  But, it could also be seen as M$'s providing (i)moral support to SCO's IP lawsuit against IBM, Linux, and Open Source.  

From: http://news.com.com/2100-1016_3-1007528.html

  "Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith said acquiring the license from SCO "is representative of Microsoft's ongoing commitment to respecting intellectual property and the IT community's healthy exchange of IP through licensing. This helps to ensure IP compliance across Microsoft solutions and supports our efforts around existing products like services for Unix that further Unix interoperability." "


  It sounds like they are gently backing SCO's claim to owning all things Unix and Unix-Like.

The two chips on the bottom are eproms, easy to make new ones except if you 
can't read them or their program is damaged.  Maybe an eprom burner could 
read most of the code and you could fill in the rest...that'd be fun.

Somewhat.  You could do an LDIF dump daily and store that, which you
could diff with.  I think there's even an 'ldif diff' tool that gives
you the info in a LDIF-centric format.

Instead of winproxy so that I can put a linux router behind.  Anyone
tried this?  What software is needed on the 2000 server to close ports
on it, etc.  The guy I'm working for claims that winproxy does some
firewalling, is this true at all?  I'm thinking his five or six class
C networks can be routed through a Linux box running iptables.  The
advantage is that winproxy will be gone, which is probably what's
causing the refresh problems for people accessing the Net.  The
other advantage is that I can offer to block Internet access 
directly to the laser machines most of which, except for a 
debian box, are running Windows 98.  I can hopefully set up 
dhcp to serve all these private networks from this Linux server 
and demonstrate that the administration is simplified by 
controlling settings in a central location.  One recommendation 
I could make in a normal routing environment is to set up an 
internal web server to display procedures in a broadly 
compatible fashion using simple html 1.0/2.0 code.  I've written 
C code to htmlize text.  I doubt anyone who gets dhcp working ever 
goes back to manual settings.

The major advantage of getting Linux in the server room is that
doing rsync from 2000 server looks much harder than doing it from
a true Linux system.  Files, jobs, have to be uploaded manually
to the laser machines now.  Linux has nice file systems to work
with that 2000 doesn't have when it comes to data archiving.  I
may offer to do software raid unless there are some good hardware
raid options for Linux.

Another problem in the shop is that they use Excel and can't afford
more than two licenses for it which is a major disadvantage for
them.  Sure would be nice if I could come up with an Excel alternative
that would satisfy their gui appetites and work with the same
data files.  They are willing to put out $30,000 for Microshaft junk,
couldn't they spend that kind of money on Linux instead and get what
they need without paying Microsoft licenses?

Maybe I should ask the administrator, Brian, to come to a Linux
conference.  Trouble is, he's hostile to any non Microsoft product.
I think he's accepted that he has no choice where I unfortunately
am not knowledge enough to demonstrate that that's wrong.

I'm sorry to hear about this SCO case.  It's juvenile.  In reality
companies should move to support and away from selling binaries
with high license fees.

  OpenOffice.org. Or, if they prefer to spend a small amount of money,
XessSE from Applied Information Systems is a great spreadsheet. I've been
using it for years and the latest version costs $69 -- retail.

  Demonstrate OO.o on a windoze machine. It works the same as on linux and
it's MS compatible -- for almost everything.

  People can be exceptionally dense, particularly those in positions of
power within a company or an industry. They can put lead to shame with their
denseness. If you don't mind my offering a couple of suggestions ... there
are things _we_ can do that preserve our sanity in situations like this.

  One is to recognize that it's his business and he can do as he likes with
it. As the old saying goes, you can lead a horticulture but you can't make
her think. If he wants to waste money and even run his business into the
ground, it's his choice.

  The other thing we can do is to fire the client and go find one who is
clueful. I've done that once and, in another situation, refused to do more
work for a client when the first project was completed. I don't need the
aggrevation and hassle of a client who wants to fight me on subjects where
he's hired me for my expertise, advice and guidance.

No one is allow to send from my server.  I just don't allow it.  Unless
they are using squirrell mail and most don't use that.  They send via
their local ISP.  Just POP off my server.  Still checking.

Thanks Russ.  That makes me feel better.  I thought the senders were those
who have only tried to send email.  I was trying to read more up on it but
had to set it aside for the day.

Is there a way to see who has only sent email from my server and who has
sent email to my server?

I'm sure there is.  Just trying to do a high level confidence test of the
mail server.  It is Postfix.

Thanks.

Hello,

You said that the user was complaining about getting bounced messages
that he never sent.  That smells like a virus, of course it could be
someone else's virus, just using your users email in the from header. 
If you aren't providing SMTP, then you can't be participating in the
sending part, you have no worries.

nice to hear someone confirm that for me.  I was at first concerned that
perhaps my box was hacked.  But I don't think so now.  I think it is a
"Joe Job" as Wil pointed out.  I'll do some research and see if I can find
more information. Thanks for the help.

hmm, would it be possible for him to start a ssh tunnel from his end to a 
unused port on your machine.  Then have his sshd listen on that port.

You should be able to ssh -p someport localhost and end up on his machine.



/usr/bin/ssh -l his.username.on.you.host -f -R 6123:his.host.ip.address:6123  
your.host.ip.address sleep 100000000

On his machine
/usr/sbin/sshd -p 6123

Then you, on your machine
ssh -p 6123 localhost


Dunno this might work.

Message-ID: <1053402162.29793.3.camel@zontar.clueserver.org>

I went and purchased a Canopus ADV-1394 video capture card.

I can get Kino to capture video, but I am seeing noise/distortion on the
row of bottom five pixels. I am also seeing a bit of color noise on the
left hand side of the image.

Anyone familiar with this card?  Have any idea what is wrong or does it
always do that?

Subject: [PLUG] Improved: Make a bootable SuSE DVD
Message-ID: <E19Hzuz-00037a-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

I didn't unset the arrays holding the directory listing. This meant any
directory smaller than the proceding one didn't over write all the previous
entries. I didn't like the way the ping times were  captured, this seems
better.

I think Rich's point is valid despite the "shove off" language.

You say that it seems like a step in the wrong direction before really
knowing much at all about it.  You assert counter-points to the individual
statements of those who use the system but you fail to take those
statements in aggregate appreciate the way the tool is used regadless of
how you might use it yourself.  You can't learn the usefulness of
something if you're just trying to find out how useless it is.

Now, I have never personally worked with UML and so I really have no
comment on its usefulness as tool for the programmer.  However, I have
seen PLENTY of bad code badly documented and I welcome anything that will
help describe the design of a program for future maintainers and
modifiers.  I think this is really a difference in philosophy more than a
difference in technology.  To me, the social aspects of how a thing is
done far supercede the efficiency or expedience of how a thing is done.
I personally believe that the purpose of work is to make the world a more
pleasant place.  The inconvenience of using a cumbersome tool (if, indeed,
that's what we've got here) in the design phase seems to be a way of
paying a small cost in pain up front for alleviating the long pains of
future developers who must work from your code.  Bad code never dies and a
little inconvenience today could prevent a lot of inconvenience in all of
our tomorrows.

Sure.  He can start outbound:

$ ssh -f -N remotebox -R22000:localhost:22
Password: (enter password)
$

That will stay alive as long as the connection doesn't fry or the
boxes don't reboot.  You then ssh to remotebox, then type

$ ssh -p 22000 localhost
Password:

And you're in on his box.  Even X-forward will work. :)

If you're really smart, you can even set up a VPN over this.

I won't tell you how I know all this, or how often I've "tested" it.

  I run two very low volume mail lists using majordomo. I don't run apache
so I cannot use mailman. Majordomo runs the lists efficiently and without
any intervetion from me. Except, of course, when folks find the unsubscribe
directions too confusing. Sigh.

  It's _very_ easy to set up and consumes few resources.

I thought majordomo at first, but I had heard it was difficult to use. 
I find this hard to believe, so I am glad to hear you say otherwise.

those that had a clue (or at least had been doing DNS for awhile) are now
implementing lots of new and interesting stuff.

And the short answer, if I understand your question correctly, is you
_can_ use one nameserver as an internal authority and as a cache
nameserver for external lookups.  I do this for my home network
(anderson.home) but since I set it up using Linuxconf and accepted the
defaults I can't provide the particulars as to how to do it.
   I also suggest looking at using djbdns (TinyDNS and dnscache) instead
of bind.  So far I have dnscache running on one nameserver (class was
Saturday and I didn't do computers Sunday - all on Monday while taking
calls and dealing with the normal Monday morning c**p) and ready to go on
several others.  TinyDNS will take a few more days since it will affect a
lot more of our operations (hundreds of domains) and is just different
enough that the transition won't be trivial.

Again I _strongly_ suggest Ed's class.

I follow the discussions on the linux1394-user mailing list, and all I
can say is that Linux firewire support is still pretty much hit and
miss. That said, it's a pretty low-traffic list, and Stefan Richter 
and Ben Collins are usually very good about answering questions like 
this.

What they will want to know is

* kernel version
* version of the various ieee1394 drivers (see dmesg)
* output of /proc/bus/ieee1394/devices

And any of the following that apply:

* libraw1394 version
* libavc1394 version
* libdv version

If you're using a stock distro kernel, they'll probably tell you to 
grab the latest subversion sources (for 2.5 or 2.4, the branches are 
separate) and try another compile.

If you've already done that, then it might be a case of sitting around 
and waiting for the kernel-level ieee1394 to catch up with your 
technology.

If it looks like the libdv stuff is part of the chain, you might try 
pinging Buck Krasic (see the AUTHORS file in the libdv source 
tarball). Buck's out here at OGI and is a decent guy.

I just went through setting up Mailman and it was fairly easy.  The main
conf file mm_cfg.py left a little to be desired in terms of the required
foundation commands that are needed, but I figured them out finally.  Have
taken some notes so if you try Mailman I would be glad to share them with
you.
Particularly useful to me is the web-based archiving.  Am using MM for a
class I am teaching and when sending out updates that each student should
receive it gets saved in one spot and I find that quite handy.  Plus all
the administrative duties can be performed from a web interface.

If you're not tied to the idea of hosting the list on your own equipment,
there are numerous sites such as topica and yahoo that will serve your
mailing list. Administration is web-based and the only charge they impose is
that they tack-on a couple lines of advertisement at the end of every

  Blum's book on 'postfix' has a section on setting up majordomo that I
found very helpful. Also, there's another book on mail lists that filled in
the blanks for me.

  I'm sure you'll get all your questions answered here.

and force you to sign up for an account for which they reset the privacy
options periodically without warning you

and make you look at ads if you want to look through the list archives

and distribute your information to their "partners"

If you value privacy and don't want to end up receiving more than 100 pieces
of spam per day, do not use sites like these.

I would, of course, prefer NOT to admin this, but I don't want to ask
all my users to sign up for a service such as Yahoo.

If you know of a service, I am all ears :)

I think I did everything right.  At least I followed the directions

Anyway, when I do the command: 

echo 'lists' | mail majordomo

I get an email with the following error:

   ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
"|/usr/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper majordomo"
    (reason: service unavailable)
    (expanded from: majordomo)

My /etc/alias file looks in part like this:

# majordomo aliases
majordomo: "|/usr/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper majordomo"
owner-majordomo: jon at manymoons.net,
majordomo-owner: jon at manymoons.net


I am not sure why it is not working.  I must of missed something, but I
am combing the docs with no success.

Oh, my!  Email is such an imprecise communication medium, eh?  It seems
I've come across as some sort of very closed minded person.

Actually, I've read some of the articles on UML by Booch (several years
back, I admit).  Recently we had some discussion about UML on another
list I'm on and we had a bit of a debate - I guess there were a couple
of other old hardware engineers on that list because I found I had some
agreement about not wanting schematics for software.

I've actually considered learning UML, but time is limited so I need to be
choosy about what I invest in.  That's why I try to find out what is
motivating people to move in that direction.  I'm coming from a different
industry where I witnessed the reverse happen: there was a movement away
from graphical design descriptions toward textual ones, and at the time
this was a rather radical shift.  I witnessed this shift first-hand
during my career.  When I graduated in the mid-80s we drew schematics
exclusively - very few people had even heard of HDLs or any kind of
textual description of circuits.  By the mid-90s HDLs were making inroads
and mixed schematic (graphical) and HDL (text) designs were being done.
Now in the ASIC and FPGA world it's very rare to find schematics being
used at all - the paradigm has completely shifted and hardware engineers
are definitely more productive because of it.  There is no way that the
types of chips being designed now could be done in a timely fashion using
schematics.

So please don't think of my criticism as merely taking potshots at
something I know nothing about; I'm merely offering my observations based
on what I've seen happen in the world of chip design over that last
fifteen years.  You can take those observations as instructive as related
to software design, or you can write them off as totally unrelated, that's
up to you.

Schematics were fine for documenting small circuits.  If you only needed
two or three pages of schematics it was a reasonable way to understand how
the circuit worked.  But for large systems it was extremely awkward.  I
recall that in my first job out of school they handed us a huge three-ring
binder full of hundreds of pages of schematics for a very complex chip
tester and we were supposed to go off and study them.  I'd take them home
and read them trying to figure the thing out.  You'd be chasing one signal
and then it would get to the end of the page and there would be a little
note about the other pages the signal went to... oh, the pain, I'm trying
to forget it. ;-)

Anyway, please excuse what seemed to be a viceral reaction against UML; it
just seems as though we hardware engineers have been there and done that
and I'm not really sure I want to go back there.

I discovered a little bit more, but none of it good.  I guess Majordomo
had a bug in the Makefile and I have fixed that.  Also I added a symlink
in /etc/smrsh to the wrapper in the majordomo directory.  I think all

  If you set up majordomo correctly then there's nothing to administer. It
will take care of subscribing and unsubscribing folks who can read,
comprehend and follow simple instructions. You'll get a notice of additions
and subtractions and that's the extent of it.

Your privacy concerns are indeed legitimate and I do think Yahoo has changed
their privacy policy more than once. I subscribe to the BLUE (Beaverton
Linux Users Education) list via Topica.Com and I haven't gotten spammed yet.
Your mileage may vary.

Of course, if you're REALLY worried about privacy and SPAM, you can set-up a
bulletin board like vBulletin or phBB. The advantage here is that none of
the discussion goes over the SMTP-based Email protocol; it's all on your
server. The disadvantage is that all of the discussion and reading traffic
hits your server. Some of your user community will appreciate the privacy
benefit of not having to list a legitimate Internet Email address on every
message they post. Some of your user community may resent having to look
outside their Email box to see message traffic on your BBS.

With regard to UML and version control, it is indeed a problem, but not
a show stopper. The greatest benefit with UML is to create a model for a
developer team and verify it against the requirements, which involves
people outside the development team. In this scenario the model is the
more and less fixed frame for the subsequent implementation. IOW,
changes are kept to a minimum and documented because they affect the
team and possibly require communication with outsiders (i.e. when
business rules or a RDBMS structure is affected). 

In some cases, i.e. a Java enterprise application where business objects
and rules are implemented as beans (classes) in a distributed
environment UML is an integral part of the development with the finished
model representing a major development effort and component. 

Personally I also use it for smaller one-man projects, because it saves
me from typing code.

Lastly, a diff is possible on the XMI file that an UML tool should be
able to create. This XML file contains the entire model and is text.

Hope that didn't upset anyone now...

    Oh, my!  Email is such an imprecise communication medium, eh?  It seems
    I've come across as some sort of very closed minded person.
    
    Actually, I've read some of the articles on UML by Booch (several years
    back, I admit).  Recently we had some discussion about UML on another
    list I'm on and we had a bit of a debate - I guess there were a couple
    of other old hardware engineers on that list because I found I had some
    agreement about not wanting schematics for software.
    
    I've actually considered learning UML, but time is limited so I need to be
    choosy about what I invest in.  That's why I try to find out what is
    motivating people to move in that direction.  I'm coming from a different
    industry where I witnessed the reverse happen: there was a movement away
    from graphical design descriptions toward textual ones, and at the time
    this was a rather radical shift.  I witnessed this shift first-hand
    during my career.  When I graduated in the mid-80s we drew schematics
    exclusively - very few people had even heard of HDLs or any kind of
    textual description of circuits.  By the mid-90s HDLs were making inroads
    and mixed schematic (graphical) and HDL (text) designs were being done.
    Now in the ASIC and FPGA world it's very rare to find schematics being
    used at all - the paradigm has completely shifted and hardware engineers
    are definitely more productive because of it.  There is no way that the
    types of chips being designed now could be done in a timely fashion using
    schematics.
    
    So please don't think of my criticism as merely taking potshots at
    something I know nothing about; I'm merely offering my observations based
    on what I've seen happen in the world of chip design over that last
    fifteen years.  You can take those observations as instructive as related
    to software design, or you can write them off as totally unrelated, that's
    up to you.

    Schematics were fine for documenting small circuits.  If you only needed
    two or three pages of schematics it was a reasonable way to understand how
    the circuit worked.  But for large systems it was extremely awkward.  I
    recall that in my first job out of school they handed us a huge three-ring
    binder full of hundreds of pages of schematics for a very complex chip
    tester and we were supposed to go off and study them.  I'd take them home
    and read them trying to figure the thing out.  You'd be chasing one signal
    and then it would get to the end of the page and there would be a little
    note about the other pages the signal went to... oh, the pain, I'm trying
    to forget it. ;-)
    
    Anyway, please excuse what seemed to be a viceral reaction against UML; it
    just seems as though we hardware engineers have been there and done that
    and I'm not really sure I want to go back there.

Message-ID: <20030520230018.9081.qmail@station173.com>

Sorry, I was out of town for the weekend.

I don't see anything that specific.  Here are some candidates.  But
I don't think, any of them help.

PCI/VGA Pallete Snoop
VGA Bios Sequence  - Choice of PCI/AGP  or  AGP/PCI  I have the PCI/AGP
PCI/PNP  ISA  IRQ Resource Exclusion  This is a pulldown that has something to do with ISA and IRQ's .  Not sure what those are.  

That's all.

So from what I can figure, as soon as the kernel kicks in, it fails to
send any output to the graphics board.  I can rebuild the kernel 
because the system boots, but don't
have any idea where to start to solve the problem.  

Does anyone know how the screen output is handled in the kernel?

Thanks for your help.

I must be missing something with respect to mailman.  How can I search
Mailman archives?  There are many linux mailing lists on the net using
this package, including our own.  However few, if any, seem to have 
a way to search the archives.  Is everyone depending on Google for
searching?  I'm never quite certain whether Google really has all of

Either that, or ht://dig or another local search engine.  It's really
too bad pipermail (the archiving component) doesn't have a search
feature.

I have looked at a number of mail list handlers.
They all have their good points and bad points.

I use to use majordomo a lot.
It is actually a decent list handler.
I don't recall much difficulty setting it up, altho there are a few picky
details.
I moved away from majordomo, because it didn't seem to be keeping up with
the times.  Upgrades were coming slowly, and it seemed to me that
spammers could send mail to a list without subscribing to the list if
they knew enough about majordomo.  Moreover, majordomo doesn't have a web
interface, and my clients needed a web interface.

Lately, I have been using mailman.  I think it is more spam resistant
than majordomo, but it has it's own problems.  It is too dependent
on the web interface.  It does accept commands via mail, but only
very basic commands.  The documentation says it supports majordomo
style commands, but it only supports a few of the majordomo commands.
I also don't really care for the way mailman stores the mail.  mailman
uses it's own format, so you have to rebuild the data base after making
manual changes.  majordomo uses normal mail format which is easier
to work with.

I have also looked at a number of the services.
I don't really trust any of them.
Yahoo sucks, but putting a list on yahoo is a good way to advertise
it's existance.
Smartgroups.com is another option.
I like it better than Yahoo, but lists on smartgroups don't get much
exposure.

Some people worry a bit about the privacy of mail addresses on lists
on yahoo, smartgroups, etc.  I don't think this is much of a concern,
because people can and should sign up to lists like this using free
mail accounts unless they want to be known.

                                          Sincerely,

Since you do have access to the system. You could install the
Nvidia drivers
http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=linux_display_ia32_1.0-4363

Although I am not certain that this is where your problem is.  

Can you edit /etc/inittab and change the default runlevel from 5 (X11)
to 3 (multiuser) and then try booting.  The question is, can you boot
to a normal login prompt and then see if the problem is the switch to
X or is the problem happening before the switch to X?

By default all output is mailed to root.  If your process doesn't create
output you may or may not get (depending on the quality of burnt offerings
you've made or even the distribution/version of Linux you're running) an
(semi-)empty message.  To insure you don't get anything place > /dev/null
after the command(s) you're running.  You'll still get errors in the mail 
but if you've been a good scripter these will be minimal.

EXAMPLE:

	chkspam.pl > /dev/null

  Redirects STD_ERROR to STD_OUT.

  Three file handles are automatically assigned when you log in: STD_IN,
STD_OUT and STD_ERROR. The first is the keyboard, the second is the monitor
and the third varies. The redirection puts error messages on the monitor
where you can see them.

In the case quoted, it sends error messages to /dev/null. 2>&1 points
stderr (associated with file descriptor 2) to the same place as stdout
(fd 1). If you wanted to capture all output from some program and
write it to a file you could do the same thing.

$ myProgram > myProgram.out 2>&1

There is a slightly shorter syntax to do this, but it escapes me at
the moment. I'm sure a scan of the plug archives would turn it up.

I would venture that you don't want the 2>&1 after the command, as that
will keep you from hearing about it if your script stops working and
starts spewing errors . . .

Message-ID: 
     <1260.192.168.1.251.1053525544.squirrel@webmail.tearitalldown.com>

Hey all!

I'm setting up a new bind server...and attempting to use views.

so for a test case... I followed an example here:
http://sysadmin.oreilly.com/news/views_0501.html


however...after I startup bind...I get this when I run a nslookup lookup
from another machine...or if i do it locally. If I do a lookup on say,
"yahoo.com" it returns proper results...and the domainname exists...and
i'd think that worst case, it'd find that domain from another dns server
and return something.


> server dev.domainname.com
Default server: dev.domainname.com
Address: 127.0.0.1#53
> www.domainname.com
Server:         dev.domainname.com
Address:        127.0.0.1#53

** server can't find www.domainname.com: SERVFAIL
> exit


all i see in my /var/log/messages is:

May 20 17:56:14 dev named[793]: running
May 20 17:56:21 dev modprobe: Note: /etc/modules.conf is more recent than
/lib/modules/2.2.19-6.2.7/modules.dep

am I missing something?

Not much help on the web and I _haven't_ tried Adaptec's site yet but I'll 
ask here first and look some more as time permits.

What is or is there a key sequence to get into this card's setup?  The 
standard Adaptec ctrl-A didn't work.  What I have found says it uses the 
Future Domain TMC2360 chip set.  Is there a hardware setup for this? 


TIA,

I'm learning and I am now seeing that Bash provides ways to manipulate

could replace the calls to cut and sed I was using with ${VAR//pattern/word}. I
have replaced a call to wc -c by using ${#VAR}. now I want a simple grep and
grep -v. I don't need it to be perfect but would like it to as workable as
possible. I would like to replace [A-Za-z0-9\ \       
\~\!\@\#\$\%\^\&\*\(\)\_\+\=\{\}\'\"\:\;\<\>\,\.\/] with classes;  [:alnum:]
.. but I can't get it to work. Any help appreciated.

Thank you

Message-ID: <1053552623.1510.393.camel@lana>

First off, thanks to those who suggested Majordomo.  It was not too bad
to set up.

Now, how do I work it so that when people hit reply it goes back to the
list and not to the person?  I know that the docs say to set the
reply_to in the config, but I did that and it did not work.  Also, they
warn not to do that because of possible loops.  Can anyone advise on
this and tell me how to get to work (if that is indeed advisable)?

  The only loops I get are some of the subscribers. In
<maillist_name>.config set the reply-to as in my example below:

        # reply_to             [word] () <resend,digest>
        # Put a reply-to header with value <value> into the outgoing
        # message. If the token $SENDER is used, then the address of the
        # sender is used as the value of the reply-to header. This is the
        # value of the reply-to header for digest lists.
reply_to            = fa-photo

  So, for this list, all replies automatically go to
fa-photo at appl-ecosys.com. I've had absolutely no problems with this on the
three lists hosted here so I cannot tell you how to get it to work unless
you tell us what's different at your end.

I have approximately 10 years worth of the official

http://www.acm.org/cacm/ that I'd like to get out of my
apartment.

If I could get money for them, great.  However, I 
would settle for someone to pick them up at my place.
I really don't want to see them end up in a landfill.

I live in NW Downtown Portland.

Anyone interested?

I did exactly as you suggested, but it did not work.  I set 

reply-to = all-league

then sent an email to majordomo

with the line:

newconfig all-league <password>

But, no change.  I did this to change the password and that worked, but
I am not sure why it is not working now.

Nevermind.

I am not sure about some of the majordomo documentation.  It says to do
the newconfig command which I did.  But, when you do that the config
file is moved to *.old.config and the *.config file is empty.

When I moved the *.old.config to the *.config file, the reply worked.

The 2920 series doesn't have any hardware setup-- if you wanted this, then
the 2940 was the card for you.  ;-)

I don't know if Linux supports the 2920.  The 2940 series works quite
nicely, though.

  Hmmm-m-m-m.  According to "Managing Mailing Lists", the above will work as
as the From header is not set to $SENDER.

  If that's not the case, I'm out of knowledge and ideas.

  Good.

  When I've made changes to the config files, I su to root, cd to
/usr/local/majordomo/lists and edit the files by hand. Guess that's why I
didn't run into your problem.

Tried it and it didn't work.  It stops sending output to the
screen just after the Master Boot Record is read.  There
is something in the kernel that needs to know to send the
screen output to the PCI graphics board.  The old redhat
dist. manages to make it work, but the Suse 8.1 doesn't
figure it out, and any install doesn't figure it out.

What could be in the redhat 6x install kernel that isn't
in the others?

Well, it worked for one email.  Very strange.  I worry that it is
buggy.  When I send a config command, the reply_to is set, but when I
sent a note to the list, the reply_to is not in the header.

Anyone have any ideas?  This is very strange.

Is the projector going to speak?  I haven't seen an announcement

  Maybe it's the other way around.  What's *not* in the old 6.x release?  Didn't frame buffer support go into the kernel around late RH 6.x or early 7.x release?  

  There's some old documentation on frame buffer support at RH: 

http://www.europe.redhat.com/documentation/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO-5.php3

  The on-line doc points to the kernel docs, located in your source tree at:

/usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb/

Message-ID: 
     <61823.66.93.77.251.1053560234.squirrel@webmail.tearitalldown.com>

Do all nslookups go on port 53 only?

this site seems to show that it looks up on other ports...
http://www.intac.com/~cdp/cptd-faq/section2.html#ports

so, if i have a firewall..and i need a client outside the lan to see it...
do i need to open more than 53?

I can nmap and see it just fine...however, after i do a:

nslookup
> server dev.domain.com
Default server: dev.domain.com
Address: 66.25.25.25#53

it connects to it...(it seems) then if i do

> yahoo.com
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

but internally...it works no problem

..any thoughts or suggestions... (off to google)

Jon,

  Could you have accidently set up the list so only designated people can
post to it?

  Here's a partial header from a message I sent to one list:

Howdy, Pluggers...

Sorry to put this here, but is there anyone who does small business
consulting or, even better, wants a little bit of a challenge? We're looking
for someone who can tell us if our Linux box is configured correctly. The
reason is is that the Linux box, hosting 3 web sites behind our firewall,
doesn't want to respond to any web requests.

It *used* to work just fine. I don't *recall* making any changes on either
the Linux box or on our Hawking firewall. It just stopped responding to web
requests. The funny thing is that the IIS server we have works fine. So, one
set of facts points to the web server, one set points to the firewall.

I've pretty much exhausted my knowledge (limited as it is) and I need to get
this fixe so that we can get the websites up and running again.

Anyone care to help?

Web server: Linux Mandrake 8.2(?) Apache 1.3 running on a Dell Poweredge
1600. Three NIC cards - only 2 are working. I think getting the third one to
work would be nice.

Please respond off-list. Thanks.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled mailing list...

Subject: [lug] Mail Filtering Workshop, Thursday 5:00.

Hi everyone -

This week's ACM workshop is on mail filtering, and is hosted by Rogan
Creswick and I. The workshop is free and will be in Milne 130 from
5:00 to 7:00 pm on Thursday. See below for an outline of the workshop.
We should also have some pizza and other refreshments conducive to
programming, although as before they have to be eaten outside the lab.

Topic: Mail Filtering
Time: 5:00 pm, Thursday, 5/22
Place: Milne 130 (across street from Dearborn)


"Mail Filtering Workshop"

Filtering spam, sorting mail lists, and categorizing messages by
sender are essential skills when working with email. In this week's
ACM workshop, we'll create a basic mail filter using procmail, a
powerful unix mail utility. We'll also see how to create and use
whitelists, spamassassin, scoring of messages based on features like
the sender and subject, and automated handling of attachments.

Less powerful filters built into email clients (pine, outlook) will
also be examined.

Place:  Milne 130 (across street from Dearborn)
	Oregon State University, Corvallis
Maps:   http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/about/visitor.html
Cost:   free!

What is procmail?

 Procmail is used to sort incoming mail into separate folders,
 postprocess mail, start any programs upon mail arrival or selectively
 forward incoming mail automatically to someone. Procmail is
 often employed in filtering spam and prioritizing mail lists.

 The accompanying formail program enables you to generate autoreplies,
 split up digests and mailboxes into individual messages and easily
 alter email headers. Procmail and formail are free software,
 distributed under the GNU GPL.

More info on procmail:

  Well, there's no "Reply to: " in the header. That's a clue.

Message-ID: <20030522003558.GA1697@dalsemi.com>

Since my new laptop doesn't have a floppy, I bought a USB flash drive
to try out.  I thought that by inserting the drive into a USB port that
the kernel would recognize it, assign it a device, create an entry
for it in /etc/fstab, a matching directory for it under /mnt and then
try to mount it.  I was only right on 1.5 out of 5 (this is with
Red Hat 9).

Are my expectations way too high?  I'm pretty sure I can do the
other steps myself, but have others been down this path?

I know that, but how do I get it in there is the questions.  If I set
the reply_to in the config file, it should be in there.  Right?

Which 1.5, recognized it and assigned it a 1/2 a device?

Haven't used a thumbdrive yet, but was very happy when RH7.3 did all you 
exepected above with an external USB SanDisk 6-in-1 flash reader/writer 
(Model: SDDR-86, $39.99 at BestBuy).

So usb pnp if fairly up to date in 7.3, 9.0 should be even better...

... presuming you're using bash.  :)

The One True Shell (V7 /bin/sh) understands 2>&1 but not the shortcut.
Therefore, that's the most portable amongst Bourne Shells.

 assign it a device,

  Perhaps, but it doesn't hurt to do so yourself.

  No. These are left for you to do. I'd first make the directory, then add
it to /etc/fstab.

  Yes. Did it disappear after you entered it? Did you add it manually, as

That won't work. It cost me several points towards Linux Gurudom yesterday
when I tried to show a co-worker neat-o Linux tricks.

For some reason -- & I hope someone out there knows why -- you can either
have a mount point for your USB storage device, or an entry in /etc/fstab,
but not both at the same time. Maybe that's because the USB device is
also linked to /proc/bus/usb -- but that's just a guess.

FWIW, we were able to mount the USB storage device by refering to it as
/dev/sda1. I had a devil of a time trying to figure out which SCSI device
had been chosen to represent the USB device. Hopefully this note will save
someone much time & frustration.

At least with RH7.3 you can have both

from fstab
/dev/sda1	/mnt/flash	auto	noauto,owner,kudzu 0 0

from ls -la /mnt
drwxr-xr-x	2 root	root	4096	May 10 18:11 flash


I'd provide more, but I can't get my wheel mouse to paste on this ThinkPad 
600E...

Can't figure out how to determine which sdaX it'll show up on either.

I have a laptop with RH8, and for some devices it creates directories and
mount and stuff, for others it does not. I haven't figured out what
activates the magic. I know how to do it manually. First of all, once you
connect a usb drive, module usb-storage should autoload. If it does not,
there is something wrong with your hotplug configuration, this part should
work. Do lsmod, see if usb-storage is there. usb-storage creates a new
scsi channel and the device appears as a scsi disk. So, you should have
/proc/scsi/usb-storage-0 directory. The disk will be /dev/sd[a-z], as for
which one, depends on how many you already have, it'll be the next one (so
if you have no scsi disks, including emulated scsi, it'll start with sda).
Partition table on the new disk can be arbitrary, but if it has only one
partition you need to mount /dev/sda1. If you want to know which one, tail
/var/log/messages or dmesg, it'll tell you when the disk is connected.

Now, I suspect that the magic works through hotplug scripts (after all,
they issue insmod usb-storage command, might as well do the other stuff),
so if you want it to happen, try downloading the latest hotplug and
reading the setup docs on http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/

The kernel knows where the hardware is, its the video card that can't
handle what the kernel is telling it to do.

Frame buffers is my still my guess, but the old 6x kernel _didn't_ have
frame buffers built in.  After a quick search through the kernel help
files, I didn't find a way to turn it off, except for recompiling the
kernel with the option switched off.  You can do this over ssh, no video
required.

Message-ID: <1053598011.27140.13.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Well, I'm a C programmer so I took my copy of djgcc and used it.
It was a stupid problem, needed to help along a program converting
a doc file to a special machine, ex2, file.  The trouble with
the batch file written to launch a qbasic program to address this issue
was that the source file to be converted ended up being overwritten
by the result, no name change.  Trying to fix this in the batch file
lead to permission problems creating a new file and I found myself
trying tricks such as embedded commands like Linux's pwd only to find I
couldn't do that or anything like that.  Running into other issues such
as long filenames I finally said forget it and went to C.  Having the
batch file put the path of the source file into a text file I choose to
read part of this to an array, C program.  To finish creating the target
I added the proper extension to that array, strcat.  Finally I used C to
copy the temp output file created by the qbasic program to the file that
needed to be created all along.  Worked like a charm except that using
malloc I forget to use free, ughhh!  Guess I'll have to fix that one
tomorrow.

Awfully ridiculous that I had to write a C program to get the path for
the output file.  It's the first time I've ever seen C and basic work
together, very cool.

                              SuitWatch--May 22nd

  Views on Linux in Business

  --by Doc Searls, Senior Editor of Linux Journal
     _________________________________________________________________

                          "The Going Gets Weirder"

   Thursday, May 22, 2003--My brother-in-law used to have a seafood
   restaurant in San Jose. Often he'd wear an amusing but cryptic t-shirt
   with a picture of hands extended upward toward a glowing fish. The
   copy on the shirt said, "Fish worship. Is it wrong?" Thinking about
   that shirt puts me in the surreal frame of mind that seems to be
   required for making any kind of sense out of what happened to SCO.

   A few months back, SCO seemed to be a resourceful survivor, quietly
   managing to combine the has-been (its UNIX business) with the won't-be
   (its Linux business) and looking at least somewhat credible in the
   process. Its revenues were sliding away:
   http://www.hoovers.com/quarterlies/9/0,2167,99709,00.html, from $17.9
   million in the quarter ending in January 2002 to $13.5 million the
   same quarter, one year later. More significantly, its cash had fallen
   from $26.1 million to $4.9 million. Dying, perhaps, but a long way
   from dead.

   Then, out of nowhere, they went batty over intellectual property, of
   all things. They sued IBM for $1 billion for violating something or
   other. Then they claimed to find hunks of orthodox UNIX code leveraged
   into Linux somehow, though at this writing they still haven't offered
   the evidence. Unwilling to sue themselves, they "suspended" their
   Linux business and warned Linux users about the "potential liability
   that could rest with them for using such software" while offering to
   "hold harmless" their own remaining Linux customers.

   As if all that stuff weren't wacky enough, Microsoft just licensed
   SCO's UNIX source code and patents--even though, when our own Don
   Marti went looking for SCO patents a couple months back, he couldn't
   find any:
   http://www.ssc.com/pipermail/atc/2003-March/000034.html.

   The best legal work:
   http://www.opensource.org/sco-vs-ibm.html so far on the case appears
   to have been done by Eric Raymond and Rob Landley of the Open Source
   Initiative. ESR's fighting spirit and gift for rhetoric are put to
   fine use in a position paper that takes apart SCO's case against IBM,
   almost phrase by phrase. Here's one of its withering statements:

     SCO's complaint is factually defective in that it implies claims
     about SCO's business and technical capabilities that are untrue. It
     is, indeed, very cleverly crafted to deceive a reader without

When I add the vga=ask boot option, I get a choice.  When I
choose scan, the monitor flickers and makes that switching sound,
and then gives me the same choices.  No matter what I choose
I get the same response.  As soon as it goes to boot, I get the
black screen.

I am starting to suspect that this is not a problem with the reply_to
but with the whole config file.  Majordomo may not be recognizing any
changes to it, and I also suspect that this may be a bug.

Could you send your /etc/aliases file entry, so that I can compare.  I
think mine is right but I want to be sure.

  I'll send a copy of /etc/postfix/major-aliases off the list. That's a
separate database from /etc/postfix/aliases.

It didn't look to me like the vga mode has anything to do with the frame
buffer being on or not.

After a couple of intimate minutes with google, I think that the vga=ask
is used to configure the video mode that the frame buffer should use. 
The documents don't mention anything about booting without frame
buffers, but they do mention using vga=792 to boot to a sane mode.  I
don't know if that will work, but it looks easy enough to try.

If it still won't work, and you can't afford to try a different video
card, then I really think your only other option is to learn how to
compile your own kernel, with frame buffers disabled.  It really isn't
that difficult, especially if you can track down a working
configuration.  

A small word of advice, make sure that you can boot some sort of rescue
disk before taking on the kernel compilation.

Good Luck

Can you run through the entire process for us? E.g.,

1. Login into client under username whatever
2. Run startx
3. Open xterm
4. Run su (the exact invocation would be helpful)
5. ssh to server
6. try to run vim

The whole X authentication cookie scheme can be difficult, and how you 
get to root matters.

Also, could you post the results of

  grep -E 'X|Root' /etc/ssh/*config

when run on both the server and the client?

Not sure what has changed.  I've been successful at this many time in
the past. 

My method:
 1. Login into client under username whatever
 2. Run startx
 3. Open xterm
 4. ssh to server
 5. Run su (the exact invocation would be helpful)
 6. try to run vim


grep -E 'X|Root' /etc/ssh/*config From the remote system:
/etc/ssh/ssh_config:   ForwardX11 no
/etc/ssh/sshd_config:PermitRootLogin no 
/etc/ssh/sshd_config:X11Forwarding yes
/etc/ssh/sshd_config:X11DisplayOffset 10

grep -E 'X|Root' /etc/ssh/*config From the local system:
/etc/ssh/ssh_config:   ForwardX11 yes
/etc/ssh/sshd_config:# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin

I can do this, thanks.  But I still have one hurdle.  The only OS
that I can get onto the system is the old RedHat.  I'd really like to
install the my Suse 8.1.  Is it possible to install the old redhat,
install all the rpms from the new Suse,  then rebuild the kernel
without the framebuffer?

Thanks

Message-ID: <33053.63.105.27.245.1053624058.squirrel@skua.ahapala.net>

I have a network setup like thus:
    Internet
        |
    Server A (10.0.0.7/255.0.0.0)
        |
      PPP modem link (10.0.0.8 - 10.0.0.9)
        |
    Server B eth0: (10.1.0.1/255.255.0.0)
        |
       LAN B (10.1.0.10 & 10.10.0.11)

Server B dials into Server A and creates a nice PPP connection. Clients on
LAN B can surf to website on Server A, however they cannot surf the
Internet (neither can root on Server B). I can "links http://10.0.0.7" and
bring up it's webpage but I can't get another server on LAN A as in "links
http://10.0.0.90".

Current settings:

Questions:
1) On Server B, what should the gateway be? The "far" side of the PPP
connection? The "near"? Should it be set to the Server A's gateway(which
is 10.0.0.92)?

2) Does arp present any problems with this? From Server A I can make an
ssh connection to Server B but from any other client on LAN A I get no
route to host.


Obviously I've been staring at this so long that I'm confused :-P

TIA,
Keith (Kdog)

I need to know if you do "su" or "su -" when you become root.

Also, once you become root, what does 'echo $DISPLAY' return?

Michael,

	I get that same message when I try to run any program that is an
X program from a shell as root when I'm a different user.  What is
happening (I think) is that VIM or whatever program is trying to bind to
a root session of X.  I'm not quite sure how to over come that.... but I
think that is what is going on.

Thank you,

I just type "su".

As root:
# echo $DISPLAY
localhost:10.0

As me:
$ echo $DISPLAY
localhost:10.0

The problem seems to be only on that remote machine.  I can ssh to
another box at home from the bad one and everything works ok.

I know this is probably a really stupid suggestion, but have you tried copying 
the .Xauthority file from /home/loginuser to /root? If xhost + is not working 
(for whatever reason) perhaps this will.. Granted, it is a "temporary" 
solution, but who knows?

That DID work.  Why is this to be considered a temporary solution?

First thing to try is copying all of the .so.8 files you created through 
symlinking directly into the $DISLIN/lib folder.

If it does not, try removing the -L$DISLIN from the compile command (NOT the 
-ldislin). This is only needed if you did not create the symlinks. 

Wish I could help more, sorry.

Message-ID: <1053627149.1568.66.camel@red>

The Portland Itec show is December 10 & 11 this year. There
will be significant emphasis on Linux at the show, including
a Linux Pavilion that I'm in charge of. The pavilion will
allow people and companies with Linux (and xBSD) and Open
Source-related products and services to have exhibit space
that will cost less that buying a whole booth from the Itec
folks.

Another benefit is that we'll have a Linux/Open Source Handbook
that will be passed out to show goers. The handbook will
contain useful reference information (which was discussed on
this list about a year ago) as well as an advertisement for
your company.

The pavilion will have access to the Internet and a
demonstration network. 

If you're interested in being an exhibitor or advertising in the
handbook, please send ME an email message (ed at alcpress.com),
please do not reply to this list. I will not respond to you
immediately. Rather, I'll add your address to a list and
I'll announce more information when it's available.

Setting your XAUTHORITY environment variable (as root) to the full path of
your individual .Xauthority file also works.

This way SSH has the proper authentication info for the funky DISPLAY it
creates.

This is probably the more "permanent" solution .. Just add something to your

  Never tried it myself. For the past several years I've used Gri for
scientific plotting <http://gri.sourceforge.net/>. It's a plotting language
and was written becuase -- for whatever reason -- the authors were not aware
of gnuplot. I have found it better documented, more capable and easier to
use than gnuplot.

The linker can't find the libraries.  From your message it looks like
they are up one level from the example directory, so something like
this might work:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH= ..:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./exa_f77

If it does, then you may want to install the libraries in the 'correct'
place.

It seems to me that if SCO owns the patents and copyrights it claims are
implemented or copied in Linux code that the Linux distribution they
created would be de facto licensing of those copyrights and patents under
the GPL.

I know that if _I_ release code under the GPL that contains patents or
copyrights that I own, I can't go around suing people who create or
distribute derivitave work based on my patented or copyrighted code.

How is that not grounds for immediate dismissal of this suit?

There are two modes, text and graphics. vga=normal switches offs graphic mode.
The right choice via vga=ask does the same. 

video=vc:5 will move the frame buffer only to the 5th vtty. this means the
default console will not have a frame buffer.

Assuming there is an on board video and a PCI card in the box, does moving the
monitor after the kernel boots work?

Thank you
Russell

Tomorrow (May 23) is the deadline for early registration for the open source 
convention.  The price of an exhibit hall pass goes from Free to $35
after tomorrow, so you might want to register even if you aren't sure
you can attend.  The June Linux Journal has an insert describing the
conference, and the conference web site is
http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2003/

The conference is rather expensive, but various discounts are available.
The best is 65% for full-time students.  It looks like plug members
can get a 30% discount using discount code 'os03pug'.  I will forward 
the relevant message from o'reilly to the list.

I could have the situation confused, but I believe it is their (SCO's)
opinion that some party or parties have appropriated their code without
permission or license and included said code in a body of work that was
released under GPL.

SCO never published the alleged code under GPL; they merely accuse the
plaintiffs of having re-published their code without permission.

let's imagine, for a moment, that I wrote a linux driver for a piece of
hardware, and I released the binary under a free-to-distribute, but no
source, license. 

Now, let's imagine, that in a moment of drunken buffoonery, I gave away
access to my machine to, oh, _you_. 

Now, you can grab the source of my code, which I stupidly left in a
world-readable home directory, and distribute it.

We're all agreed that that's not legal, right?

So then let's imagine I didn't know about this totally illegal thing,
even though it made Slashdot and this mailing list and whatever, and I
decided I wanted to make a Bigger Better Linux Distribution whose big
goal was going to be how good the hardware support was.

So I went and got all the big distributions, and put together all their
drivers, and made it into a distribution, and sold it/gave it away
(under the gpl).

Whoops! Wait a minute! My driver was in there.

Under your statement, it's now GPL'd, and the fact that I didn't
actually gpl it, I just included a previously gpl'd copy in my
distribution, is irrelevant.

I dearly hope that's not what the law says, because if it is, EVERY
business in the world is going to hate and fear the gpl.

If SCO's lawsuit is shot down, it should, nay must be shot down because
they don't have the evidence to prove infringement. If IBM took UNIX
code and put it in Linux, they had better lose and they had better pay.

Software has gotten too big and too complex for it to be easy to keep
track of everything that went into it, especially something like a
distribution. It will be too easy for some programmer to grab a GPL'd
piece of code and use it in his code, assuming that since the final
project will be GPL it's okay. One of those programmers is going to
realize a week later that the code he just released to the world wasn't
GPL'd by its owners.

And that's the real trick: The argument you use says that somebody else
can GPL your code.

Apparently it wants to see something like this in your
.bash_profile, or whatever your distribution uses:

DISLIN=/home/rtk/dislin
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$DISLIN/bin
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DISLIN:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH DISLIN LD_LIBRARY_PATH

I'm still not quite sure what it does, but it

  My quick scan of their Web site suggested to me that this is a graphics
library you can embed within your code and use to produce graphs from within
your application.

  Not the same thing as Gri at all. The latter is a stand-alone application
(but I've put the output -- as .eps files -- into LaTeX docs).

Not quite.  I'm arguing that SCO GPL'd their own code when they released
their distribution.

They may have done so by mistake, but (assuming they have a real claim to
any of the code in the Linux kernel, which is a HUGE assumption...) they
did, in fact, distribute it under the GPL.

Any distribution of copyrighted or use of patented material BEFORE the
time of SCO's distribution is fair game in the courts and they should
(under the law, not under any justifiable moral code) be able to sue for
whatever damages were incurred in that time.

Quite frankly, if you're going to print up some CDs and put your name on
them, you'd better darn well know what's on those discs.

Of course, we can all avoid messes like this by collecting explicit
copyright transfer in a central location for each project.  The Free
Software Foundation has done a great job for the GNU stuff, but Linus has
been notoriously lax in this regard.

If anything's going to kill the GPL, it's going to be that kind of lazy
selfishness.  Recall the hypothetical situation that caused Apple to ban
underage developers from the Darwin project.  If you don't (or can't)
enter into a legal contract and sign over your copyright to the maintainer
of the code, you might, at some point in the future, dispute the
maintainer's claim of copyright on the work and attempt to collect
royalties on the work.

Incidentally, this same failure to properly document and aggregate
copyrights on updates and patches is the only thing fuelling the schism
between GNU and XEmacs.

This paper puts it all in perspective.  It's lengthy but worth reading if 
you're worried about this issue.  In light of the info therein, SCO's suit 
has no merit whatsoever.  Of course, as Michael pointed out, there is the 
amazing ability of laywers to make something out of nothing, especially when 
backed indirectly by an entity with as much money as M$.

I've used Dislin quite a lot and found it to be very useful, although it is 
somewhat complicated and may take awhile to achieve the exact results you 
want.  A very good thing about it is that it allows you to control every 
aspect of your graphics, which isn't true of some other popular libraries.  
The author is also helpful and even responded immediately with a fix for a 
bug that I found.

My opinion for whatever it's worth,

I just read Galen's earlier messages that address exactly what I asked.  
That's what I get for not reading through all of the recent PLUG messages

See this is exactly the argument I'm afraid of--it means the default
corporate policy, for safety, must be no use of open source code or
projects. Because something like this might happen accidentally, and
then you're screwed.

I'm not convinced that their distribution of it is licensing it under
the GPL--the gpl is an explicit statement by the copyright owners of the
copyright. They never wrote their own statement entering the pieces into
the GPL--the GPL is, to some degree, a choice. The idea that they can de
facto GPL something by accident is grotesque.

Hmm...quite frankly, if you're going to print up some chips at a fab,
you damn well better known how they run.

It's gotten to the point that complexity is overmatching those who
attempt to manage it, even with management techniques, simplification
strategies, code reuse, etc. Software projects can have hundreds of
developers on them, and projects can use dozens of libraries. No one
person could possibly know everything that goes into the largest of
projects.

The problem with this is that you are now giving up your copyright to a
third party that you have no control over. You've lost all of the rights
of copyright, even those left to you by the GPL. The FSF has taken them
over. If the FSF decides tomorrow to start selling Gnu projects for
money with no source code, they can. That cannot happen in Linux,
because too many people own the copyright to too many pieces of the
code. And in my mind, that's a good thing. Open Source is a community,
and the FSF has decided to be dictator over that community, and while
they did found it, that's rather presumptious.

  PDXLUG is an "official" ORUG and that group is as officially constructed
as is PLUG. Robby was looking for volunteers to both man a booth offered by
ORA and to coordinate that booth. Don't know where he is on this.

  I looked carefully at the benefit:cost ratio and determined that for me it
was so much less that 1.0 that I would need a double to hold the appropriate
number of places. The price is, IMO of course, outrageous.

  Several years ago I taught a full-day short course in Ecological Risk
Assessment at an intenational mining convention. The participants paid less
than $200 for the course; I think it was $125 or $150.

  Value, of course, is set by the consumer. If enough folks are willing to
shell out (bash, naturally) $1,500 for the full convention's "early bird"
price, then ORA is right to charge that much. If ony a half-dozen folks show
up, then next year's price is guaranteed to be lower.

  On a related note that fluttered into my mailbox today, SCO resigned from
membership in the German linux group when pressed for specific examples of
code they say was taken from their Unix and used in linux. If they hadn't
run away yesterday, the group planned on meeting tomorrow to consider
kicking SCO out.

  Perhaps they have a corporate brain tumor. That would explain the bizarre
behaviors.

  So it looks like the equivalent of Gri. That, too, is totally under the
user's control. And when I found some bugs they were fixed right away. Other
things weren't bugs but a translation error from Canadian to American, eh?

Not really.  a) the document you sign with the FSF indicates
otherwise.  See conditions.text, e.g.:

  <http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-devel/2001-August/011205.html>

in particular:

  "The assignment contract commits the foundation to setting
   distribution terms that permit free redistribution."

And b) even if, on some distant planet, your fantasy scenario were
possible, people with copies of the source packages could go on
developing their own copies under the GPL, independent of the FSF.
All you lose is the future labor of those who previously were doing
work for your benefit at no charge.

It turns out that Dislin was the sort of thing I was
looking for. It stores the data points in arrays
before doing any plotting, though, so it is definitely
not interactive.

There are example programs on Dislin's Web site,
www.dislin.de. If you want the output to go to your
X-Window monitor, which is probably what you do want,
the following code, in the language you are using (in
this case, Fortran 77) should be inserted above CALL
DISINI and as close to it as possible:

CALL METAFL('XWIN')

In this case, it was worth the trouble to overcome the
obstacles to using a program. Fortran was the first
computer language I learned, but when I first learned
it such capabilities were not available, at least
where I was learning it.

  Yup. I learned FORTRAN in 1972. After using it for two years building
ecosystem models the grad school insisted I had to take FORTRAN 100 for a
semester. ZZZZZ-z-z-z-z-z. But, after working with FORTRAN IV, WATFIV and
the G and H compilers, I finally moved to C in 1987. Now I'm adding java to
my lexicon.

Huh?  You're only "screwed" when you distribute the stuff under the GPL.
That doesn't mean you can't use it.

Well, score one for simplicity, then.

No, they can't.  The GPL REQUIRES all derivative work to be released under
the GPL.

Remember, the GPL is a copyleft.  It turns copyright against itself.

This is exactly what Microsoft was talking about when they said it was the
opposite of intellectual property and "unamerican".

> That cannot happen in Linux, because too many people own the copyright
> to too many pieces of the code.

Just the opposite.  Linus cannot prove he holds the copyright to much of
the work and the various copyright holders could contest the inclusion of
that code in the kernel and hinder its development and distribution.  The
copyright holding author could claim that he did NOT give permission for
his code to be released under the GPL and everyone suffers.

> Open Source is a community, and the FSF has decided to be dictator over
> that community, and while they did found it, that's rather presumptious.

Again, just the opposite.  The FSF has offered to be caretaker of the one
thing of which we all agree must be taken care:  the freedom of the
source.

Personally, I don't mind if it's the FSF or IBM or Debian or Irene
Developer, esq..  What matters to me is that there is a discernable chain
of transfer of control of the copyrights into a GPL release.  With no
formal statement, the ambiguity can create a nightmare.

In the XEmacs versus GNU fiasco, the problem isn't that the FSF doesn't
have the copyright, it's that the copyrights are not clear AT ALL.  There
are patches that were submitted via email, for example, without any
document that might be construed as consent to include it in a GPL
application for public distribution.  When you are a sole developer, the
COPYING or LICENSE file you include is just such a statement.  "This
package is free software", etc.  And getting back to the original point,
SCO actively distributed Linux kernel source with just such a statement
attached.  That's pretty much the definition of releasing the code under
the GPL.

Of course?  Let's be a bit more open-minded, shall we?  This kind of dogma
is thrown around without even the slightest shred of justification.  Like
when people say, "Of course, the free market produces the best possible
solutions.", etc.

They're RIGHT to charge that much?

If I drilled a well at the edge of the desert and sold glasses of water
(which I received more or less for free from Mother Earth, minus some tiny
cost per gallon in upfront drilling and pumping), would I be RIGHT in
charging $10,000 a glass to the dessicated souls who crawl out of the
barren wastes dying of thirst?

Surely those people would be WILLING to pay for the life-giving fluid, but
is that really what it's worth to me?

I maintain that value is set by the possessor.  A thing is worth that
which would allow you to part with it without regrets.

For a glass of water to a man who controls a well, that would be just
about nothing.  For a seat in a convention hall with a prestigious
speaker, it would be a combination of what it is worth to the hall
maintainers to give up the use of their precious space and the speaker for
the trouble of coming out and speaking to those present.

There is usually a great difference between what CAN charge and what you
SHOULD ask.

And remember that putting the value in the mind of the purchaser, all good
and unique things go to the wealthiest people whether they can be used or
not.  There are people in this world that would part with their summer
villa in the south of France with as much regret as you or I part with a
stack of token ring NICs.

In a system where the purchaser sets the value, everything has the highest
possible price and having becomes indistinguishable from using.  In a
system where the possessor sets the value, those who need can more readily
obtain from those who do not.

I agree it's expensive, but I think you are making it sound worse than
it is.  1500 -> 1050 with a 30% discount.  It's pretty clear that
virtually everyone gets some sort of discount.  For $1050, you would
get 4.5 days worth of conference, including 4 tutorials.  

That said, I won't be signing up for the whole thing.  :-)

There is only one session that I'm really at all interested in, and to
me that isn't worth $626.50.  

I am a little curious about the timing of the 30% discount.  I suspect
maybe they are having a little under-realization of expectations,
registration-wise, particularly with the weak IT economy in the area,
and the 30% may be a way of trying to poke things up a bit at the last
minute.  I am not sure the change will be significant enough.  It
wasn't for me.

After lurking on this thread for a while it dawned on me that you all
have a really good grasp on what *needs* to happen in this case. So now
let's take a look at what reality is in this country:

http://www.forbes.com/finance/lists/setters/keywordSearchSetter.jhtml?passYear=2002&passListId=54&passListType=Person&passKeyword=Milken

For those of you that don't remember Mr. Milken, he did a couple of
years in club fed for something that really resembles the current tech
stock scams. The interesting thing about Milken is that he's still the
301st richest American with a personal wealth of 775M, even after his 2
year vacation - that's right, his assets remained intact when they
should have been seized and returned to his victims in an attempt at
restitution.

What does this have to do with SCO; Not a thing, but it has everything
to do with reality. If you don't believe me, just ask Jeff Skilling and
Ken Lay, I'm certain they would be happy to look you in the eye and
smile as they tell you that money wins.

I guess the moral here is that pitting the ridiculous against reality is
an even match.

I apologize for the digression, I couldn't resist.

FYI.

all user groups were originally offered a 20% discount a few months
ago...now locals get 30%.

The problem with this lawsuit is that the SCO Group's [*] claim is so
vague: at first they claimed IBM contributed intellectual property
stolen from them to Linux development, then it was contributions to the
Linux kernel, & now it appears that they are claiming that Linux
developers have been stealing from the codebase the SCO group now owns
for years.

(Frankly, as someone who has used SCO Unix several times over the years,
SCO is about the last flavor of UNIX I would want to steal ideas from,
let alone source code! And I know I am not alone in this regard.)

While Jeme's argument -- that the SCO Group nee Caldera should have known
their intellectual property was in the version of Linux they were selling --
is plausible, it only responds to one piece of the SCO Group's claims.
Likewise, although ESR's whitepaper plausibly argues that any of the
code SCO could be complaining about did not reach the Linux development
group thru IBM's involvement in the Monterey project, it does not respond
to the SCO Group's other claims.

Until the SCO Group's claims become more detailed, there is simply no
way for anyone to respond to them intelligently. I think what we Linux
enthusiasts have to keep in mind are some very simple facts:

* The SCO Group's revenues in the last year have fallen by 50%, & not only
are they hemmorrhaging losses in revenue, they have less than $5 million
in cash left.

* Darl MacBride's profile on the SCO Group's webpage talks much about his
ability to raise funding, but lacks anything concrete about his ability
as a manager or his vision for technology.

* The SCO Group has been signalling over the previous months that they
would be looking for ways to capitalize on their ``intellectual property
rights."

* Ignoring what Caldera had, & what assets SCO & Xenix UNIX gave
them, their jewel in the crown was ownership of the UNIX O/S source code.

Apparently MacBride couldn't figure out how to broker a new deal for
licensing the rights to UNIX, so he decided to sue somebody to provide
enough cash so The SCO Group could figure out their next move. And if the
judge laughs in MacBride's face next month over revoking IBM's license to
UNIX, this lawsuit will become even less worisome to everyone involved.

Geoff

[*] Please keep in mind The SCO Group & the Santa Cruz Organization (SCO)
are two different entities. Some of us have enough reason to hate SCO,
having used their operating system; launching a barratrous suit against
IBM is not one of them.

  Thanks to the latest (June) Linux Journal I have discovered SQLite and
realized that's what I've been seeking to use in my accounting software.
Because the library's basically typeless (everthing not recognized as a
well-formed number is text), it puts the burden of constraint checking on us
coders.

  I want to enter dates in a sortable order, so I suspect that the Japanese
expression (YYYY-MM-DD) is the way to go, and that's just fine with me.
However, rather than re-inventing the wheel, I'd like to find an existing C
function that would check data entered into that field to ensure that it is
a properly formed date.

  Does anyone have such a critter, or could you point me toward one? I have
money-checking functions, but not date-checking functions.

TIA,

Rich

After hours last night I changed that and it didn't have an effect.

The problem was that Server A somehow got it's ip_forward set to 0 and as
no one on the LAN routes packets through it, I got no other clues.

The simplest things sometimes, eh?

Thanks for your input,

  Thanks, Kelly. It didn't help: I have a pcmcia serial card so I don't use
the USB port and I can dial directly to my ISP but the connection is broken
as soon as it's made. Therefore, I suspect it's something in the connect

Rich,

Did you check boost.org? This one is C++:

BTW, YYYY-MM-DD is ISO norm. Also makes good sense when you deal with
SQL.

I'm having problems with a remote lpr printer. The first print job gets
stuck in the queue. The second job initiates the print-out of the first
job. But only the first page. And this goes on. The printer works fine
from a Windows box through Samba. 

Any ideas? If not I'll turn to cups as suggested by Paul Heinlein.

Thanks!

Here are the printcaps:

  I have seen it used widely, particularly with data bases. I know it makes
sense (that's how I sort dates in the notes in jpilot), but I believe that
it was invented by the Japanese in any case. :-)

  I had all sorts of fits with this type of problem. CUPS is the answer.

Thanks, Russel. And thanks, Rich, for your recommendation.

I should have mentioned, it's RH8 on both boxes. They use lpd.perms,
which has these entries on my print server:

ACCEPT SERVICE=C SERVER REMOTEUSER=root
ACCEPT SERVICE=C LPC=lpd,status,printcap
REJECT SERVICE=C
ACCEPT SERVICE=M SAMEHOST SAMEUSER
ACCEPT SERVICE=M SERVER REMOTEUSER=root
REJECT SERVICE=M
ACCEPT SERVICE=X REMOTEIP=192.168.6.0/255.255.255.0,128.0.0.0/8
REJECT SERVICE=X NOT SERVER
DEFAULT ACCEPT

I don't think it's a permission problem. Otherwise printing wouldn't be
possible at all, wouldn't it?

Here also the latest entries in the status.pr file:

  No ... and yes. Several years ago I could not get the remote workstation
printing via lpr and CUPS fixed that. Now, for some reason, I have the same
problem. But, there'll be time this weekend to work on this.

Rod,
If you are still interested in using inn+suck, I've had it up and 
running for about
a year.  I don't remember now what documentation I used other than the suck
website.  There was also a suck email list, which was very sparse, but I 
think
I still have an archive of it someplace.  Anyway, I can check my own setup
and memory to give you help.

I would like to test the passwords of users on my

machines, the passwords are stored in /etc/shadow. I
can't figure out how to do this.

I copied /etc/shadow to my crack directory, and tried
"./Crack shadow.txt" but it didn't like the format. I
tried manually copying the encrypted passwords to
password.txt (copy of /etc/passwd) but it didn't like
it either. I noticed that the encrypted passwords are
34 characters long, but examples I've seen in
documentation are only 13 characters or so, which
might be a clue.

Did you thumb drive come with a file system?  I tried mounting
it and an error message showed up in /var/log/messages saying

The passwords are in MD5 hash format, not crypt/des format.

It is possible to do it using a current version of Crack or you can use 
another tool like John the Ripper.

Message-ID: <000501c32193$cc203dc0$651010ac@lemonhead>

Normally I'd agree with the idea that the big money will win the case
regardless of the facts, or as Steve says "the ridiculous against
reality is an even match."

This situation has important differences:
1. SCO (and perhaps Micro$oft) are suing IBM.  Even if Microsoft
acquires SCO and sues IBM directly, IBM still has the resources it needs
to defend its self.
2. IBM will vigorously defend its self, and the GPL to whatever extent
serves IBM's purposes.  IBM is deeply involved with the GPL and with
Linux, yes?
3. The government isn't directly involved in this case.  In the Milken,
Lay, Skilling and the M$ antitrust case, the government was the
plaintiff (I'm guessing that somehow Milken, Lay and Skilling have so
far dodged other lawsuits).

These differences mean that we have more reasons than usual to be
optimistic.

I'm still trying to figure out what the best possible outcome would be.
I'm pretty sure I don't want Microsoft purchasing SCO outright.  I
believe the Linux community would be better served if IBM acquired SCO,
but only after a successful counter suit.  Someone needs to make an
example of Blake Stowell, Chris Sontag, Darl McBride and the rest of
SCO's officers.  Otherwise this kind of thing will continue.

-EcD.

Subject: Re: [PLUG] The latest on SCO vs. reality


After lurking on this thread for a while it dawned on me that you all
have a really good grasp on what *needs* to happen in this case. So now
let's take a look at what reality is in this country:

http://www.forbes.com/finance/lists/setters/keywordSearchSetter.jhtml?pa
ssYear=2002&passListId=54&passListType=Person&passKeyword=Milken

For those of you that don't remember Mr. Milken, he did a couple of
years in club fed for something that really resembles the current tech
stock scams. The interesting thing about Milken is that he's still the
301st richest American with a personal wealth of 775M, even after his 2
year vacation - that's right, his assets remained intact when they
should have been seized and returned to his victims in an attempt at
restitution.

What does this have to do with SCO; Not a thing, but it has everything
to do with reality. If you don't believe me, just ask Jeff Skilling and
Ken Lay, I'm certain they would be happy to look you in the eye and
smile as they tell you that money wins.

I guess the moral here is that pitting the ridiculous against reality is
an even match.

I apologize for the digression, I couldn't resist.

Steve

Message-ID: <1053741618.20107.11.camel@lana>

This is the weirdest thing I have seen.  I have been hosting DNS off of
my machine for years, but I have never seen something like this.

I am not even sure if this email will make it through because all my
email is queueing bec DNS is failing.

I can ping www.manymoons.net but when I do a nslookup or dig, it does
not return the IP for my machine as expected.

I can browse to www.manymoons.net, but sendmail is queuing messages to
manymoons.net bec it cannot get a host map.

My guess is that I will not even see this message from the list because
of the failed lookup.

What could be causing this?  I have been setting up majordomo lately and
playing with the /etc/aliases file but everything worked without problem
after that.  I am also wondering if this is a problem at network
solutions bec I had an issue with a different domain name about two
weeks ago.

I am at a loss.

Well, that would be because there isn't any partition table on the drive :)
Go and create one with fdisk. If you want to format it in FAT32, mkdosfs does
not do a good job, try to get a Windows machine to format it for you.

As I said originally, my post was a digression, do with it what you will
but remember that it was never intended to have a clean fit into the SCO
vs. IBM saga.

Speaking of this saga; I'm sure most of you have heard that Microsoft
has licensed SCO's Unix source code and patents but are we all aware
that many in the IBM user communities are speculating that IBM will
settle this case out of court to save the defense costs? Think about the
impact that scenario would have.

Seems to me SCO is foolish for not doing what they should have with
their Linux distro and now they want to impose a rigid licensing scheme
the way Microsoft does so that they can survive on low quality coding.
That isn't the answer.  The only concern I have is seeing society as a
whole come to the understanding that open source doesn't mean a bankrupt
software industry.  How does the joke about the four engineers in the
car without brakes go?  Something about the software engineer wanting to
try again to make sure the brakes actually are shot.  The curious
question to me is why is SCO going under?  Is SCO affiliated with Novell
at all?

Has anyone noticed that printing is slower from Redhat 6.x to Redhat
7.x?  I have a Jetdirect box and wonder why it takes so long to print
now even when it only has to print text.  Another problem I've run into
is that acroread 5.0 for Linux won't print.  For that problem though a
newer xpdf opens the document.

I have gnome and Redhat 7.3 and I have installed pango-devel, atk-devel,
freetype-devel, glib2-devel, gtk2-devel, pkgconfig, and XFree86-devel.

I guess everything else to do gtk window programming is already
installed.  Do I need to use pkgconfig to configure things before I can
create a simple window program?

How do I tie gimp into this so that I can do simple two dimensional tile
style graphics.  I'm after basic animation.

These look like C programs, how do I verify that these gtk headers are
properly installed?

Do the Redhat packages vary from how this is normally installed on a
Linux system?  How so?

For starters it would great to create a single button that is clicked to
terminate it.  After that I can hopefully work on more complex projects.

Ran into a TI-92 driver for Linux, looks like someone has gotten the USB
link to work.  Wonder what module in the 2.4.20 kernel needs to be
compiled in or if I have to download code for the TI libraries and
modules that have been developed for it?

This glade is interesting, it looks like a graphical programming
environment for making windowing applications.  I can write C code
just fine also, I would just need to learn the gtk stuff.

Apaarently the processor in the TI-92 is just a Z80.

The way I learned GTK+ was just reading the Tutorial on the web site http://www.gtk.org/tutorial/ This tutorial was actuall well written enough that I was able to figure out how to do it using Python as well.  so yeah, read the tutorial.

The TI-8x calculators were Z80-powered, with the exception of the '89.
The TI-89 and -92 were based on the Motorola 68000. Not shabby for a
hand calculator. Lots of folks have spent time hacking on these things,
too. You can even do your own assembly programming, if you're into that
sort of pain. :-)

Message-ID: <1053847986.31299.28.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Are these connected?  I'm curious as I want to try some simple animation
in a portion of a window.  I know xscavenger is a real nice example of
using a couple of images of a man to create the illusion of movement
when those images are displayed one after another much the way a
cartoonist would would do with paper and pencil at first.  Apparently
with gimp it's possible to create tiles and then using these tiles build
maps.  I know Warcraft II has a map editor that is tile based and older
games, battletech I for example, are this way also.

For starters I'd be interested in an area of a Window where I can have a
blue tile move around a map of green tiles without leaving a trail. 
Achieving that I can upgrade the blue tile to a series of images run one
after another to achieve animation.  If this can be accomplished within
a gtk window I can use the gtk buttons which seem to be fairly easy to
learn how to use for quit and other things.

I take it since gtk is used in a C program that a program I have written
that is very similar to hangman could be graphically enhanced using it.

How standard is gtk+-2.0?  Is this the most popular widget set or are
there other common choices?

Course games aren't the only use of this graphical programming :=)

  A google for 'snmp browser' returns 169,000 hits. There may be one or two

  In today's "Oregonian", Steve Duin's column skewers Karen Minnis for
killing HB 2892. Featuring our own Paul Nelson, and others intimately
involved in the effort to get the bill to the floor of the House, Duin puts
her actions into the context of the Republican Party mantra: smaller
government, fewer expenditures, cut out the fat/waste. For a political
agnostic like me it made for very interesting reading.

  It will be quite interesting to see if folks remember by the time the next
election comes around.

Take a look at sourceforge.net. There are many projects that look like
they might help in your search.

There are about 240 RFCs that talk about snmp in one way or the other.
You and search your favorite RFC index site and narrow the search to
find what your looking for. Try this site:

It seems to have a fast and complete search engine.

Hee hee. This is fun. Mr. Duin does a great job pointing out that Minnis 
personally killed this thing while mouthing the words of the lobbyists 
and betraying her own party's values of fiscal conservativism. Nice. 
Here's the link:

We're not done with this thing yet. If you've got the time jot a quick 
note to your state senator with the above link, do it. Even if they've 
already heard from you once. The senate actually has the power to move 
this forward. This would be especially helpful if you live in Kate 
Brown's Portland district, as the democratic leader, she could make a 
big difference.

Hi Geoff, LTNS!

Software to run SNMP server and client software is at
http://www.net-snmp.org/ . This is the rewrite of the ucd-snmp. The
current rev, 5.0.8, is the best one they've released since 4.2.3.

We use snmx from http://www.snmx.com/ to poke around the MIBs. It lets
you navigate them as if they were a UNIX FS (cd, ls, etc.).

Subject: [PLUG] The issue that just won't go away
Message-ID: <200305251207.08121.pundit@teleport.com>

Folks,

Now the antics of open source's opponents has caught the
 attention of Steve Duin:

http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/steve_duin/index.ssf?/base/news/105377817415280.xml

For those of you who live outside the Portland, OR area, you might 
say that Duin (pronounced "dean") is the dean of political 
columnists in Oregon -- he's been writing for years and is 
probably the state's most-respected and most-widely-read local
pundit.  He's the one who broke the story last year about
Microsoft threatening software audits of cash-strapped public
schools at a time of year when they had neither the time nor the
personnel to prepare for it -- and then offered a way out via a
new licensing scheme that would have cost dozens of teaching
positions.

When I got a call from Duin the other day, I knew that the lid
 was about to blow off of the whole stinking mess that Oregon's
 open source bill has turned into.  Though all observers now
 agree that HB 2892 is "probably" dead, the issue just will not
 go away and it's turning into a political liability for Oregon
 Speaker of the House Karen Minis, who ordered the bill killed
 last month.

Duin's column appears in today's Sunday Oregonian, which (for 
those of you outside the Portland area) is the most widely-read 
newspaper in Oregon and southwest Washington.  Earlier this month 
a guest editorial that I wrote* appeared in the same paper, after 
which insiders in the State Capitol reported that Minnis was 
"tearing her hair as we speak."

It looks like Karen Minnis is about to have another bad hair day.

Any other webmasters logging traffic like this? Any idea what flavor of worm
is at work? This guy consisently got redir'd since his browser reports

Subject: [PLUG] mail server or mail client software problem...
Message-ID: <MEEKKAPIMDJAJLIOBCHCMEAHCLAA.bmdimaculangan@bhpi.com.ph>

We?re running Red Hat as our mail server, Postfix as the MTA and MS outlook
2000 for our mail clients. Now my question is this, I have this situation
reported to my by users that they are encountering problems regarding email.
These were the two situation reported to me.

First:  when the user1 at mydomain.com <mailto:user1 at mydomain.com>  send email
to user2 at mydomain.com <mailto:user2 at mydomain.com>  , user2 at mydomain.com
receives 3 copies of user1 email sometimes more than 3 copies. But not all
users encounter this kind of problem; I?ve already checked the configuration
of their mail client software and find nothing unusual.

Second:  when user3 at mydomain.com <mailto:user3 at mydomain.com>  send email
with attachment to user4 at mydomai.com <mailto:user4 at mydomai.com> ,
user4mydomaim receives the email but without the attachment.  The subject
and the body were intact but the attachment is missing. For this one I don?t
know if the problem is the MS Outlook or the Mail server. How could I check
form the server if the mail has an attachment?

I hope someone could help me with this and give me some clear explanation.


TIA

It's probably a nessus scan ( www.nessus.org ). Everything in the logs
that you included looks like it's focused at Windoze and nessus is built
to scan for these vulnerabilities and much more. If your machine isn't
an IIS box I wouldn't worry - unless this sort of stuff continues.

Are you doing any virus scanning that might be gobbling up the
attachments?

Just wondering if this is possible. One thing I miss from my Mac days
is the way the mouse pointer would disappear as soon as there was
any keyboard activity. I would think this shouldn't be too difficult
to implement with X, but then I have no deep understanding of how it
works. Are cursors entirely the domain of the application that's got
the current focus? Anyone? Anyone?

Steve,

Thanks for the nessus pointer. I wasn't aware of this tool (looks
interesting). However, the scan didn't come from the LAN side of my
firewall, it came from Taiwan - which leads me to believe that either:

(1) the originating host was infected with a worm, or
(2) if it was nessus at work, they had misconfigured it, since (quoting the
nessus FAQ)...

1.5.5. What kind of a hole must I punch in my firewall to let nessus do it's
  job?

  To be honest: If you put any kind of firewall on the nessus server or
  between the nessus server and the host you are trying to test you will get
  a distorted result. You will not be able to rely on the results from your
  scan.

  Putting a firewall on the nessus server to secure the nessus server is an
  incorrect approach. (Or at least an incomplete approach.) Harden the
  server instead.

  If you have a firewall between the host you are about to test and the
  nessus server then you will get a result that is not similar to that of
  testing the host directly. This may be the desired result. If you want to
  be 100% sure you have hardened you host you should not rely on a firewall
  in front of it.

cheers,
Sandy

Message-ID: 
     <49915.12.225.239.223.1053927520.squirrel@webmail.tearitalldown.com>

help!

I had a program that needed a newer version of glibc to run...so I used a
rpm from mandrake to upgrade...and it kept complainign about
dependancies..so I eventually added --nodeps...

the program worked!
(good, right?)

well..now...mysqld dies upon startup. (seg fault?)

I see this in my .err file... but not sure where to look for more
information.

I can only assume that the glibc upgrade killed it...and now I don't know
what to do. I downloaded mysql to try to install it again..but that didn't

This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary

or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.
We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help diagnose
the problem, but since we have already crashed, something is definitely wrong

glibc is one of those updates that you don't want to trick or force if it's 
not happy--it's just too central to your system.  That said, I've never seen 
  unmet dependencies with glibc--do you remember what they were?

You need to fulfill the dependencies, or downgrade to the previous working 
version.

This is an older power supply, and if I could get it working, it would
be great for PLUG meetings.  

I do not have the time to fix it.  Is there anyone on the PLUG list who

I know I'm real wary about messing with glibc but since a newer version 
would be a different version isn't it possible to have multiple 
versions of glibc co-existing on the same system? I looked at my system 
and it looks like I have glibc 1.2 and 2.0 o it. My system started with 
SusE 7.2 and has been upgrade to 8.0 and later 8.1 so I probably have a 
bit of kruft on my system.

Subject: [PLUG] Mandrake 9.1 Virtual server problem
Message-ID: <Pine.GSU.4.21.0305260337410.19159-100000@garcia.efn.org>

I know this isn't the Apache mail list, but in fact, I can't find an
Apache mail list.. if someone knows of a good one, please direct me to it.

To start off, it might be best to point out the fact that I have a web
server running Mandrake 7.1 without any problems.. including virtual
domain serving.  I'm not sure why I am having problems with Mandrake 9.1
and virtual servers, but I am.

When I connect Mandrake 9.1 to the Internet, I can access the Apache
server through any other computer connected to the Internet by using the
IP address, but when I try to access a virtual server on Mandrake 9.1 via
name (for example, http://www.powwowdance.com), the web browser cannot
find any such server.  

Question #1:
How long should I wait before the virtual server (assuming it is set up
correctly) is accessible to everyone on the Internet?  I've waited at
least 2 hours to see if it has propagated, but it still doesn't connect.

Question #2:
I have a server running Mandrake 7.1 that works just fine.  Its virtual
servers all work well, and its ip address is 63.224.195.57 with a virtual
web server name set at www.vivid-eye.com.  I am installing Mandrake 9.1 on
a completely different  computer, which I can also connect to the Internet
at the same time.  If I number the Mandrake 9.1 server to 63.224.195.56 in
order to keep the 9.1 server online at the same time as the 7.1 server,
will giving the 9.1 server the vivid-eye.com name conflict with the
current 7.1 server name?  I'd like to run the new 9.1 server all the time
to see if it's just a propagation problem, but I don't want it to conflict
with the 7.1 server.  What can I do?

Question #3:
This is my current setup for the new 9.1 server, does it look correct?  If
it does look correct, then I don't know why I can't access the new 9.1
server (P.S. http://www.powwowdance.com will probably work fine if you
check it now, because I will have connected the working server by the time
you read this):

I am using the latest Apache version, whichever one was shipped with
Mandrake 9.1

Does the above look ok?  And if so, why can't I access that
virtual domain from the Internet?


Thanks for any help.

My 2 cents:

I run a web server here at home (apache!).. I use Comcast cable service. I 
get, on average, at LEAST 10 of these "hack" scans a day from different 
addresses in the Comcast world.  In my case 99.99% of these scans are other 
Comcast subscribers.... There are 4 or 5 regular offenders (10 scans a day, 
everyday, for weeks) that I have forwarded on to abuse at comcast.. Script 
kiddies at home testing out their scripts on the "broadband lan". It's 
amazing too - some of these people will run the scan for minutes on end, 
sucking up a TON of bandwidth and being a general nuissance. (I just checked 
- this month ~ 75%, or 3000 of 3900 of my hits (according to webalizer) have 
resulted in 404s.)

I have taken to doing reverse scans on the heavy abusers.. You would be 
surprised how many of these morons have NO firewall and NO security.. I have 
yet to see one scan report any of these would-be hackers running anything 
other than the standard M$ fare.. ;-)

I have NEVER had anyone from overseas yet running that type of scan (they tend 
to portscan). If you run Comcast, I can GUARANTEE you are getting these 
scans.

no browser suggestions, but SNMP is not dead ...

One extremely practical tool which utilizes SNMP -- MRTG 
(http://www.mrtg.org).

You may also want to check out the Simple Times: 
 http://www.simple-times.org

SNMP is used by a lot of remotely-managed devices (e.g. 802.11 access 
points, Brocode
SAN switches, IBM (LSI) SAN servers, to name a few) which require you to 
load
a "management application", and then control/manage the device from a remote
workstation.

These are more DNS questions than apache questions.  The apache server
becomes aware of any and all changes as soon as you restart the server,
and it successfully loads the new configuration.  No waiting.  Changes
to DNS are the ones that take time to propagate.

This won't test the "propagation" problem, it will just create on.  If
you change the ip address in your DNS zone, then it will take time to
propagate, if both servers are up and running, and serving out the same
content, then your clients will never know the difference.  However, if
one of your servers is broken, then your clients will be migrated to a
broken server and will notice the change.

No, you need to specify a unique server name for each virtual host.  You
have only specified your domain name for the server name of each virtual
host, not a unique server name.

Here is where you need to have a machine name (like www.powwowdance.com

I don't understand why you want two virtual hosts pointing to the same
directory with the same virtual host name.  Something needs to be unique
about this entry to make it useful.

These should be ok, from what I've read, you might want to change the
www entry from CNAME to an A record (with the ip specified).

You'll want to test this on something other than glibc first, but the man 
page says something like,

# rpm -Uvh --oldpackage glibc-<old.version-here>.rpm

should do it.  If rpm chokes during this, you're likely to be spending the 
rest of the day reinstalling the OS--so cross all your fingers.

the attacker is testing for many IIS vulnerabilities. Normally worms are
not that diverse, they'll check for a few at most ( over and over and
over in the case of sqlslammer ) due to the need to keep the code small.
The logs that you referenced earlier really look like an advance
scanning system of some sort since they touch on a large number of
possibilities. Just out of curiosity, have you looked at cert.org or
securityfocus.com to see what they have to say?

The faq that you quote above speaks to placing a firewall on the nessus
server (scan source) side, not on the destination side. Your machine
would be the destination. Also, some tools like this will allow you to
enter a number of valid addresses to use as the source address ( a form
of spoofing - nmap does this quite well ) so there is no guarantee that
these requests are really coming from Taiwan. Besides, if you are
listening for requests from the Internet on your machine and not using a
firewall capable of verifying packets then your effectively not
filtering those listening ports through a firewall.

Some systems do install what you have and it's okay, but it does get messy. 
  Don't think it'd be practical to have two point releases (2.0 & 2.1) 
co-exist though.

In this scenario the workforce numbers would not change, the platform
they work with would. I think everyone here knows that supporting
winblows and linux desktops is going to be roughly the same support
paradigm, same SLA and same delivery. Almost all of the individuals that
I've worked with at ODOT are very capable of learning a new OS ( this is
not to say they would be happy about it ) and at the end of the day a
wholesale replacement of all MS would likely require more staff.
Besides, if your factoring in the savings of pink-slipping a portion of
the ODOT tech staff you should also factor in training for all of the
users - there goes the 4 million in savings!

Just what Oregon needs, more tech layoffs.

Lets see. Many moons ago I was charged with about 150 winblows boxes, a
dozen or so Novell servers and associated infrastructure gear. This held
true for a number of years through 3 corporations. Just as an FYI; DMV
has a team of 5 to support well over 1000 installed machines.

Once again, we appear to be tripping over dollars to pick up dimes.

OK, since you seem to know about ODOT, how many computers do those 250 people
support? I didn't make up the two top quotes they were in the article, I was
just playing with numbers. 83 positions at $4-5 million saved; comes out to
$48192-60,240 a year jobs. Does that seem real to you?

Battery is going in the box. Usually I have a script to set the time at boot,
but I did a new install and need to put it all back together again. 

As to good or bad, I suppose it depends on if you're working or not, now and in
the future, and whether that means anything to you. If it is true that 1/3 can
be let go because of a change in OS, then it will happen because that is a huge
incentive for any business or agency.  May you live in interesting times, is
the polite way to put it.

IT needs don't stop at the OS, they begin there. The idea is to shift 
manpower from maintaining a platform to higher level tasks like working 
with clients' information. There will still be plenty of information to 
be processed and analyzed, only now we'll do it on an open platform with 
open standards.

I think that all of the individuals currently working will be learning
to work with another OS as opposed to hitting the unemployment lines
only to have their position taken by someone else. It's a matter of
learning to master yet another tool - a lot like the difference between
using a hand saw and a chop saw.

This appears as though you feel that the platform doesn't need
maintaining. Do you actually believe this or are you trying to advocate
that platform support come from an external entity ( adding considerable
cost and removing all accountability )?

I haven't seen anything different or interesting about this so far. It
looks like the typical argument that we see every time that the nation
slips into a recession. It's a good argument but, in reality, it picks
apart areas that have very little impact on budget or jobs.

It really doesn't seem realistic. You and I both know that the work load
that these positions currently take on will not disappear magically
because we have moved to another OS platform or a common transport and
open data storage methods. Eliminating positions only puts the state
into a mode of not doing the work ( unacceptable ) or contracting it out
at a higher rate ( current budget conditions prohibit this ). Ah yes,
there is one more minor issue that your missing here, these positions
are union members and not likely to go anywhere.

None of this changes the fact that ODOT is already running leaner than
any IT shop that I've worked with in my 20 year career. To think that by
terminating any number of tech folks is going to save money is really
not approaching the issue intelligently.

I was accepting the argument that Linux maintenance consumes fewer 
resources than Windows maintenance. My point was to shift those 
additional resources. But, yes in some cases I believe it's good to 
outsource IT. I don't buy the extra cost argument and as for 
accoutability, we can always hire a local consultant who has a strong 
reputation in the community for quality worksmanship. I'd wager he's 
more accountable because his reputation is on the line.

I firmly believe that Linux consumes far less platform resources but
when looking at Linux at the desktop I think that it's a wash with
windows - in some cases it will require more human resources. In fact,
at least for the short term, the resources to do the initial migration
will be far greater due to the training requirements of users and
administrators. The biggest selling factor that I see is the simple
dollars saved in license fees. These savings can be easily consumed when
the cost of contractors are added to the migration and I do see that as
being a budget road block.

I would love to believe that a contractor would be more accountable due
to reputation issues that you cite above but I've seen too many times
where the contractor just points a finger and goes back to work. In all
cases hiring a contractor to augment existing staff is cheaper than
adding head count to staff. Short term contractors are a budget blessing
but the nature of this thread is staff elimination and you can't
contract perm staff and expect that to save money.

By the way, this has been stimulating conversation but retooling ODOT IT

Message-ID: <20030526223659.M97261@laynesoftware.com>

Sorry for the mildly off topic post, but I know there are some ADP people reading.

I have a set of RealityX Release 3.1 manuals from April 1993.  Ten manuals in
a box.  The box is beat up but the books are in great shape.  Pages are all
bright white and no writing in them that I've seen.  I bought them from a guy
in Brighton a while back when I thought I was going to join a RealityX shop. 
I paid $70 including shipping, and would like to recover my investment.  I
work in downtown Portland and can deliver in the area.  A great reference set
for any Reality/Pick/jBase people.

Thanks...

I'd like to reaffirm Steve's arguments and throw in a short rant of my
own for good measure.

As Steve keeps noting, playing any game without a full understanding of
the rules and strategies is a losing proposition. I have heard very few
arguments that have any consideration what-so-ever of the rules and
strategies of the game of government.

I keep hearing from the opposition from HB2892 that it is a "a solution
in search of a problem". I keep hearing on this list that HB2892 is a
solution to this problem or that problem.

I don't see HB2892 as a solution to anything. I see it as refining the
laws already on the state's books. Even if HB2892 eventually dies a
complete death, I hope you have learned much. I hope you learned that
there are already laws on the books that require the state to seek
vendor-neutral "open" systems. I hope you all learned the process by
which a bill becomes a law, and hence are more effective at helping
kill bad bills. I hope you all learned that agencies like DAS hold
public hearings where we can express our interest in keeping tax
dollars within the state rather than subsidizing out-of-state mega-
corporations.

I hope you all will learn that bickering over how many people can
be fired in any particular state department is probably not the best
argument we can be making at this point in time ;-)

Steve,

  You might be someone who can address a concern raised by Ballmer and the
other Microserfs: that the training and support costs of linux are greater
than those of Windoze so what appears to be "free software" costs much more
in the end.

  No matter how I turn this around and look from different sides I cannot
see what they claim is there. I run a _very_ small linux network. Over the
past six years I've spent less time with the system than I did with the few
months on NT-4 and the years before with DOS.

  I don't understand what 'training and support' costs are with linux that
are so high. Can you explain it?

Thanks,

Rich

I don't think I have my notes anymore; I think I left them behind 
when I left ODOT, but to my best memory it's somewhere around 
three or four thousand computers.  Yes, a few of them -- very few 
-- are SCO unix (and guess what?  We never had to touch them, at 
least not until they clogged up with dirt so bad -- 'coz nobody 
ever had to open the box -- that they just died) but everything 
else, except for a few servers, is running 'doze.

Well, *I* know differently.  Linux, MacOS and the *BSDs all take 
far less employee time to maintain than 'doze.  Have you ever had 
to keep a 'doze enterprise going?  I have, and I could never keep 
up with the work.  Ever had to keep a *nix environment going?  I 
have, and they took FAR less time to maintain.  And this is the 
same story I've heard from EVERY tech who has worked in both 
worlds.

Well, I don't know where the hell you've been working because I've 
never seen as much waste in MY 20-year career as I saw at ODOT.  
Nobody there ever has to work very hard.  My co-workers spent at 
least two hours of their workdays, every day, socializing with 
friends and taking care of personal business.  One even had his 
wife bring the dog into work every day, where he spent 
(typically) an hour or so playing with it and walking it!  I'd 
say that in a typcal day most of us only did maybe three or four 
hours of real work.

We had to drive to Coquille, or Medford, or any number of other 
far-away places 2-3 times per week to fix some stupid Windoze 
problem that could have been handled remotely if ODOT had been a 
'nix shop.  And in many cases, we were fixing the same problem 
we'd already fixed a week or two earlier.

And THAT, sir, is why I approached Rep. Barnhart with the proposal 
to write HB 2892.  I've worked at ODOT, I've seen the waste, and 
I figured that what I saw was only the tip of the State 
government iceberg.

Hey Rich,
The cost is not long term but it does exist. Training end-users to work
with Linux after years in Windows is going to require time and funds.
Success of said training will depend on the users tolerance for change.
Now granted, this will be a one (in some cases 2) time shot but it will
be a significant price for this states budget to fork out in a short
amount of time. Phased in with roll-outs of the operating system and
applications will ease the pain but only if the phase-in is planned over
a 4~6 year span.

Beyond end-user training there is a real problem meeting business
requirements for the current desktop applications that just don't exist
in the Linux world yet (e.g. Visio, Project). This issue will dictate
that some Windows desktop installations will not be able to be upgraded
to a real OS, thus the need to support multiple desktop platforms will
be necessary. Once desktop applications mature on gnome and/or kde then
this need for support will diminish.

In the infrastructure applications realm, things like enterprise
authentication and security, file and print services, enterprise
groupware and system management will need to come to life. Training
existing support staff will be time consuming and costly. Again, there
will be a period of time where both platforms will need to exist.

On the data center side of things, rewriting the current Windows
applications and retraining existing support staff will be costly and
time consuming as well. Again, these are very short term costs and when
all is said and done, it will result in server systems that are stable,
low cost and at least 35% faster than the same Windows application
server.

As for Balmer, he's been spending too much time in the marketing
department. The cost savings from eliminating the need for torturous
license fees, eliminating the mass quantities of software to keep a
Windows machine clean and virus free and eliminating the cost of
continued support for proprietary data transport and storage mechanisms 
make it about even with the scale tipping toward Linux. This is
primarily due to the obvious long term benefits of moving to an
open-source platform. Besides, Balmer's selling off his shares of MSFT
as we speak - I don't think he even believes in his own rhetoric.

http://money.cnn.com/2003/05/23/news/companies/msft_ballmer.reut/

In no way do I see that eliminating state positions will help the cause
for Linux or even be seen as a benefit of changing to Linux - those
positions will be needed to support the additional OS. I do see that
there can be significant savings in migrating services and servers to
Linux while supporting these services and servers with the current
staff. ODOT is currently, as well we should be, jumping all over these
savings where it's feasible to do so.

Hope this perspective helps,

Steve

When migrating applications and services across platforms the work load
shifts, it does not go away, in many cases it gets larger for a short
time. Besides, even after everything is migrated that time normally
spent rebooting a windows box is usually spent in proactive monitoring
and maintenance of that healthy *nix system. Apparently, by your own
admission in the previous statement:

"(and guess what?  We never had to touch them, at 
least not until they clogged up with dirt so bad -- 'coz nobody 
ever had to open the box -- that they just died)"

you didn't do much proactive maintenance or monitoring so I guess you
wouldn't know this.

And to think, most of us thought it was to promote open-source in state
government. Your personal agenda has deceived many, how sad.

I do not buy this argument.  Every time MS comes out with a product, I
see this as a cost (be it A new Office suite or OS).  I think this
counters a zero cost for OSS, but you pay for training on many systems,
not just computers.

Fully usable alternatives exist for these and others.  If you are
willing to break from the cycle, then pick one.  The real issues is
legacy data, these two products have unknown file formats.  But that is
poor argument *for* proprietary software, since it is a primary one
*against*.

Legacy systems will be needed.  For once full encapsulation is an option
(VMWare, Wine, etc.).

This is true for NT 3.5 -> 4.0 -> W2K -> 2003, 98-Me->XP, Novell -> NT
domain -> ADS.  

I see no difference.  When you upgrade it costs.

> On the data center side of things, rewriting the current Windows

I am not sure anything needs to be rewritten.  future versions, and
projects, yes, but that is assumed.

Under the Bill if you could say "Hey rewriting this ASP code will cost X
and upgrading it is Y and Y < X by a significant %, then by all means
you should choose Y. (ignoring all other arguments against close formats
etc.)

This is normal, and it is *some* of his shares.  Bill does this all the

I don't think anyone is selling an argument. Reality is what it is, the
conversion to Linux at the desktop will require training where moving
between NT and XP didn't.

Show me. Where is the MS Project equivalent? If it existed I would wrap

You have to be joking? Release wine and/or vmware on the states end-user
community? That is way out of the design spec for this software and, in
the case of vmware, doesn't eliminate anything. Now granted, these
products are great for a certain audience but you can't fully believe
that it's an OS environment for the masses.

Scrap the OS part of this counter, it's been mentioned previously in
your argument. The relevant portion of this is the Novell...  and the
functional equivalent is not ready for prime time yet, still more work
to be done on these projects. Once it's developed I have no doubt that
it will be considered.

I am, that's why I mentioned it.

The only good 2892 would have done was sent a clear signal to Redmond.
As it stands right now it has accomplished this and it assisted in
lowering the cost of MS. Passing this bill would have required more
justification and more dead trees and thus would do nothing but
bottleneck and already slow process.

Relax on this one, it was a joke Zot.

I still maintain that the cost of moving to Linux is a wash right now.
As projects move forward it will get easier and easier to sell to the
states business management but that will take some time. Eventually the
move will happen.

  I understand that dia (among other options) is a viable replacement for
Visio and MrProject is getting better all the time.

  More than a decade ago I was working for another consulting company. They
used to do things like org charts by hand. I started doing them on my
computer. And the office manager's response was, "Can you move this box to
the other side? Company policy is to have it on the left."

  "No", I responded.

  "Why not?"

  "Because that's how the programmers made the application. Does it really
matter on which side the administrative support box is placed?"

  "No, I guess not. Can you change this color here?"

  And so it went.

  Here's a thought: take a lesson from the clerks at Fourbucks Coffee who
started the concept of placing tip jars on the counter. Put a jar on your
desk with a sign, "If you don't like change, please remove it from your
pocket or purse and place it in this container." You might have a nice
salary supplement that way. :-)

  I wonder ... I read that often Microsoft makes changes in their latest and
greatest releases that are not backwards compatible. Aren't there equivalent
costs just sticking with the Redmond religion?

  Well, duh! That's what Microsoft is: a marketing company. Just like IBM in

ever invented.

Sure, that will work, but both virtual hosts in tour httpd2.conf file
were just powwowdance.com and all of your testing was to

For something this simple, you want `mv' (move)...

mv Blue-1.0.tar default-1.0.tar

Or if you prefer to use the rename command, the syntax
would be:

  rename "Blue" "default" Blue-1.0.tar

And if you want real flexibility (and grok Perl's regexp), see Jeremy Mates'
improvement to Larry Wall's `rename.pl' script:

http://sial.org/code/perl/scripts/rename.pl.html

That's what I use for complex globbed renames.

Hopefully it would send a clear signal to the state departments as well,
at least help provide a small amount of air-cover for anyone who saw a
good opprotunity to use open source software within the state.

I simply could not get this to work.  No errors, it just simply was
ineffective.  I created /etc/postfix/permit-domains, which consisted of:
domainname.com    OK
ipaddr^^^^        OK
(used both domain name and ip addr of the mail server just to be sure)

Added the line in main.cf:
smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
       check_client_access = hash:/etc/postfix/permit-domains,
....

Ran "postmap /etc/postfix/permit-domains" which generates a
permit-domain.db file.    (should main.cf say instead check_client_access
= hash:/etc/postfix/permit-domains.db?)

Then nothing else happened, still rejected the good emails based upon helo
checks.


Have gotten it to accept mail by domains by adding the following to
/etc/postfix/access, then postmap access:
domainname.com     OK
ipaddr^^^^         OK

I observe the following references to /etc/postfix/access in various parts
of main.cf:
smtpd_client_restrictions =
        permit_mynetworks,
...
        check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/access,
        permit
smtpd_helo_required = yes
smtpd_helo_restrictions =
        permit_mynetworks,
...
        check_helo_access hash:/etc/postfix/access,
...
        permit

smtpd_sender_restrictions =
...
        check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/access,
...
        permit

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
        permit_mynetworks,
        check_recipient_access hash:/etc/postfix/access,


What's the functional difference between:
check_client_access
check_helo_access
check_sender_access
check_recipient_access
?

I'd prefer to have the stand-alone file per Ed's suggestion, rather than
mucking around in /etc/postfix/access, but that didn't work for reasons I
don't understand.  Any input is appreciated.
Thanks

Yes.  Personally, serving 10 domains.  Professionally, internal and

I like it a lot.  Fast, easy, and internal zone transfers are done via

I've been using it since 1999.

I have also been using tinydns for awhile and love it.  The format of the

I actually use tinydns/djbdns, and it works rather well.  The config files are easy to deal with, and all the security that exists within it, which is probably why your even looking into it.

I can't really give a good technical rundown on why it's nice, other then the fact that it's easy to set up, and easy to use.

  I have two files in addition to /etc/postfix/access. One is called
'badaddr' and contains the domain names I want to reject; the other is
'badip' and it contains the IP addresses I want to reject. In each file the
first entries are my white list.

  I'll have, for example,
this.domainisok.com	OK

and
123.45.678		OK

  Then I run /usr/sbin/postmap <badaddr|badip>

and they work.

What does your entry in main.cf look like which refers to the
"badaddr|badip" files?

Do you know if _both_ files are necessary?  Would it still work if you did
one or the other?  Or could you specify both the domain name and ip
address in the same file, or are both files needed?

Do you also use header_checks and body_checks files?

Thanks for the help!

I'm dumb!! Went out and bought a notebook (compaq presario 2100)  without checking

Any distro that will work? I'm a newbie looking for a simple install & nice user interace

  Can't comment on "simple install"; that may be an oxymoron. But, "nice
user interface" is subjective. Any and all will work.

I've used a couple of revisions of Dia, it's not quite there yet but

The cost of sticking with Windows is high and not moving off just locks
you in at that high rate. As I said before, converting is a wash but the
long term gains from converting are where the savings are.

I think that most reasonable folks understand that it's not feasible to
cut position. There really isn't any return on that venture.

  AFAIK, you could combine them in a single file. I find it easier to have
the divided among two files (one with names the other IP addresses).

  It may appear aggressive, but I'm down to 2-3 spam per day that slip
through. I can live with that.

  Yup! Sure do. Right after the above I have:

header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks
body_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/body_checks

Assuming the Compaq 2100 & 2105 are just different models of the same
laptop, it looks like you can get it partially working with some effort,
but there will be problems.  The following url comes up using google.

  Did Mandrake give any reason for non-compatibility?  I suspect that 95% of the hardware is supported by Linux.  It must have a weird BIOS, an unsupported video chip, a broken USB, or some such nonsense.  It may even be something that you don't need.  

  I'd recommend booting up a Knoppix CD as a starting point then snoop around a bit.  Check the boot logs and /proc for hardware information.  Then google for installation info.  The Red Hat site has a hardware compatibility list.  The kernel developers mailing list is a great source of information about new hardware support.

Yeah, as a matter of fact:  "This hardware isn't compatible with Mandrake Linux, due to 
the lack of open source drivers or the unwillingness of its manufacturer."

And your suspicion is right. A couple of earlier replies gave me pointers to some web 
sites of users that had installed Linux on a Presario 21xx. There's a few gotchas but 
they have workarounds.

So I'm going to buy a copy of Mandrake bring it and my notebook to the next clinic and 
have at it.

I guess you could shorten that to "change is a hard sell".

I had the benefit of sitting at the bargaining table.

I can't get to the Mid-Willamette Valley Linux User's Group page right
now, but Google tells me that the proposed admendments can be found
here:  http://www.mwvlug.org/legislation/index.html

Off the top-of-my-head, the amendments that DAS wrote were that all
"paper work" requirements were removed, "must consider open source" was
changed to "shall also consider open source", the term "open source" was
added to existing statutes, and that all definitions were left up to
DAS under administrative rule.

The amended bill had no teeth what-so-ever, it only acknowledged
the general concept of open source.  I guess that in itself was too
threatening...

   "The proposed amended bill still says that in every new software
   acquisition, state agencies shall consider open-source solutions,"
   said Jim Craven, lobbyist for the American Electronics Association,
   which opposes the bill. "It still has a 'shall' in there. I am not
   lobbying in opposition to open-source systems. Our concern with the
   bill is the mandate to state purchasers that they 'shall' do this or
   'shall not' do that."

Sigh. I guess my arguement that my agency's purchasers supported the
bill (in its original form) and the fact that DAS itself suggested and
drafted the admendments was not good enough...

The gnome terminal font change isn't changing the font where choosing
any font seems to mess up text display.  Is this possibly a missing
dependency?  If you just select gnome at install time are all the
necessary packages on the first compact disc alone?  I wonder if
something is simply missing or if I need to do some kind of font
configuration for this to work properly.  It's interesting if I do ls
-la that I can see hidden files but not non hidden files.  

This gtk stuff is cool, I got to see a demonstration of a flame man
animation this evening.  It's really nice for creating graphical
interfaces, etc.  

I restored usability of gnome terminals by looking up the default
setting on another user account, this solution isn't desireable 
though because the default font is hardly readable.

I did a network install so I imagine it's possible that it wouldn't
catch not being able to find a package.

Perhaps there's a gnome terminal bugfix package?

If you are willing to wait for the packages to compile I would suggest Gentoo. 
It can be intimidating to a newbie.. You basically install and compile your 
system from scratch. There are no "compatible" systems - it will work for 
you. 

Upside: You get a fully optimized system, optimized for your 
processor/platform. Gentoo has the greatest user forums I've ever seen in my 
entire life, anywhere, for anything. Easy going, wonderful people who will 
bend over backwards to help you. Gentoo is quick, and lite if you would like 
(a bonus for notebooks.) Bonus: You learn how linux works from the ground up.

Downside: You have to wait for ALL packages to compile. KDE takes ~ 12 hours 
to compile on an average to modern system. It can be intimidating for a new 
user to hear "you have to compile everything" (portage does it for you.) You 
have to download all packages, taking bandwidth and time. Negative: You learn 
how linux works from the ground up. (haha)

If you do decide to go with Gentoo, my username on forums.gentoo.org is qubex 
- I'm always willing to help a newbie with gentoo! :-)

If you like to reboot to play a game. Or can you also run the game without

I know that it had to be a lot of work just to watch it be diluted and
eventually poured out. However, it did shake up a lot of folks and in
that context the work was not wasted.

Unfortunately, after reading some of the most recent posts here, I have
to question the original authors motivation for putting this together.
Reading certain replies it appears that open-source was just a
springboard for justifying a lot of state agency terminations.

 Besides, I'm not sure I like the idea of having the equivalent of
Affirmative Action for Technology. Open-source will win the battle just
fine on merit and cost when applications become mature. It's been around
for years and the development continues; albeit at a slower pace thanks
to the economy. 

Don't get me wrong, for those of you with motivations that are in the
interest of promoting open-source, it's my opinion that your efforts are
noble and greatly appreciated but just like a few lazy co-workers, those
in the movement that are sleazily promoting their small minded personal
agendas are dragging you down.

  Is there a way to configure pine for automatic responses when I'm out of

it is possible, I'd want to configure it to respond to mail arriving in my

I don't think pine has an autoreponse type of filter.

Plus, I'm not convinced that having a vacation-ish feature in a mail
client is a good thing. You'd have to leave pine running while you're
out of town, making it easy to lose track of mailbox locks if you 
check your mail remotely while you're away.

If you rely on pine (as opposed to procmail or sieve) to filter
messages for you, then afaict you're out of luck.

If you use procmail for filtering, then you could pretty easily add a 
pipe-to-vacation rule at the end of your .procmailrc.

Since I used the term "affirmative action" with regard to HB 2802
here 3 weeks ago, I thought I should be the one to respond. You
say that Open Source will win the battle on its merit and cost.
This doesn't happen in most Microsoft shops. If it did, why would
there still be Microsoft shops? Why would companies, for example,
still be using IIS?

It doesn't matter that our Linux and xBSD servers have remarkable
uptimes, are resistant to attack, cost far less, etc. The decision
makers refuse to use it, opting instead for the market leader's
ill-designed products. Nothing seems to convince them that
alternatives are needed. Their computers are attacked time and time
again, year after year, and still they refuse to even consider
alternatives.

Why not affirmative action for technology? It's what we do when
society refuses to cure its ills.

You also said that Open Source will win when applications become
mature. You may want to reconsider this.

I assume you're referring to Ken Barber. If so, I think you're way
off base. Many of us have suffered because of the Microsoft monopoly
and at the hands of Dilbert managers who are clueless about
technology. Ken has his horror stories and I have mine. Ken has
said (though I forget in what forum) that he wants to be sure it
doesn't happen to others. I don't see this as sleaze or being
small-minded. I admire Ken for his efforts and committment.

I do this by putting the following in my ~/.forward file:

\ali, "|vacation ali"

This drops the mail into my inbox AND pipes it through the vacation
program, which will respond with the message that you've put into
~/.vacation.msg.  Look at the vacation man page for the gory details.

  Thanks, Paul. I do use procmail so I suppose that anything falling through
to my inbox would also send a reply message to the sender by using mail.
Didn't think of that. If I can make some time (ha!) I'll look into that.

  Thanks, Ali. First I need to go find the vacation program so I have a man

Matt, regarding Gentoo, I've got a little laptop that I just love.  It's
a Travelmate 330 Pentium II at 400MHz with 64M RAM.  It's now running RH
7.2. If compiling KDE is a problem, then I could use a more light weight
WM. Do you think it would be feasible to install Gentoo?

Excuse me, but ad-hominem personal attacks are not appropriate in 
this or any other discussion of issues and legislation.

Concern about rampant waste of taxpayers' money does not qualify 
as "sleazy" or a "small minded personal agenda."

Please stick to the issues and keep your mind-reading and 
speculating about others' ulterior motives to yourself.

It used to be that you added the suid bit to smbmount so that ordinary
users could mount their smb shares.  If you try that now the prorgam
spits out an error that it is not allowed.  Logging in as root to mount
the desired share doesn't work as the files end up being owned by root,
which is wrong.  The smbclient approach is annoying.  I've looked in
info under fstab and su but I haven't found anything helpful that would
either mount a user's network shares to his/her home directory at boot
or otherwise allow users to mount their smb shares without root
priviledge the way adding the suid bit used to.

I've always applied the suid bit to smbmnt and smbumount, not 
smbmount. Given that setup, it works fine on Red Hat 9 (samba-2.2.7a).

  Well, that's what Don Marti wrote in March and what ESR wrote earlier this
month, but it's nice to see an established player -- particularly Novell --
confirm what everyone but SCO (and, apparently, Microsoft) knew. What really
puzzles me is how SCO's lawyers or whatnots could have cooked up this
cockamamie scheme when they lack both patents and copyrights. Without those,
what could be a claim basis?

  Looks like FUD, Inc. will have to admit a couple of new operating
divisions: SCO Group and Microsoft. That's diversity.

Having just compiled KDE for a PIII-650, you're looking at 25+ hours of 
compiling fun. (Depending on your USE variables and the like)

You might want to go with fluxbox which is much lighter.

Hi everyone from beautiful HEON. (hind end of nowhere, somewheres in the wilds 
of Eastern Oregon. Where men are men, wimmen are tuffer n rawhide, and cows 
have the right-of-way)

The Novell press release gave me the best laugh I've had in days. The June 
Linux Magazine has a good column on the whole mess too, Steven 
Vaughan-Nichol's "Shutdown" column. In essence, he lays the blame on Darl 
McBride and his henchpersons (my word, not Steven's) who ousted Ransom Love 
and his execs last year. Then they hired Boies, Schiller, and Flexner- I hope 
I don't need to tell you who David Boies is. It's not a firm you hire for 
everyday business law. They came a gunnin fer trouble.

Indeed.  

I believe our problem is far more basic than anything likely to be
addressed by state law, to wit: We aren't offering what people want.

Technical people fervently believe that technical products should be
evaluated and purchased strictly on technical merits.  But it should be
more than obvious by this point that this isn't how it works.

What the world wants to buy and what Linux gurus offer aren't typically
in sync.  It's (perhaps) sad but true that human factors will trump
technical excellence every single time.

It's a last resort for redressing *provable* harm that was done to a
specific group of people.  It is not an appropriate way to "correct"
market differences among various products.

After all, why stop with Linux?  Why not have affirmative action for the
Amiga?  Why not require that a certain percentage of state records be
stored on punch cards or cassette tape?  Don't punch card vendors
deserve a piece of the pie too?

I'd amend this to say that Open Source vendors will win when open source
*marketing* becomes more mature.  Really, most of us are still out there
talking about technical excellence, failing to notice that few
purchasing decisions hinge on technical excellence.  

I'd strongly recommend the book _Selling The Invisible_ to anyone who's
having difficulty selling their services.  It will do a lot more to
improve your cash flow than any act of state government is likely to.

FWIW,

Dylan

The Official SCO statement on the matter is:

   http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/030528/law059_1.html
   SCO Statement on Novell's Recent Actions
   Wednesday May 28, 10:15 am ET
   
   LINDON, Utah, May 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The following statement is 
   being issued by SCO (Nasdaq: SCOX - News):
   
   SCO owns the contract rights to the UNIX? operating system. SCO has
   the contractual right to prevent improper donations of UNIX code,
   methods or concepts into Linux by any UNIX vendor.

   Copyrights and patents are protection against strangers. Contracts
   are what you use against parties you have relationships with. From a
   legal standpoint, contracts end up being far stronger than anything
   you could do with copyrights.

   SCO's lawsuit against IBM does not involve patents or copyrights. SCO's
   complaint specifically alleges breach of contract, and SCO intends
   to protect and enforce all of the contracts that the company has with
   more than 6,000 licensees.

   We formed SCOsource in January 2003 to enforce our UNIX rights and we
   intend to aggressively continue in this successful path of operation.

So they're suing IBM over a breach of contract.  Now I want to know how they
are going to pursue the 1500 large companies that they sent letters to, the
ones that threated to sue them over infringing code.  Presumably they don't
have a contratural relationship with SCO.

But that's exactly what's happening. The specific group
of people being harmed are those people who have strong
technical skills but now have difficulty finding work
because technical knowledge and technical excellence is
no longer in high demand. This is not a case, like
coal stokers on locomotives, where skills have been made
obsolete by technological improvements that benefit
society. This is a case where not only is a class of
people being put out of work but society as a whole is
suffering for it - though they don't know it.

It's already taken a toll on this country. Much of the
American IT industry work force were brought up on the
popular plug-and-play, point-and-click technologies
that insulate the underlying technical details from
not only users but support staff as well. They're not
capable of dealing with problems down at the bare metal
layers. Many American companies that need these skills in
their workers have to hire foreign nationals who still
know the stuff because their schools and Universities
can't afford the cutting-edge technologies.

I've written an essay on the subject that's based on my
experiences in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia,
where I had an opportunity to discuss this very issue
with a Pakistani recruiter and technically-skilled Arab
men who were seeking work in the United Stats. I'll find
it and post it here.

You're in the coal stokers area now. I'm don't think a
response is needed here.

I'll have to agree with you here, but this only reinforces
my argument for affirmative action.

Subject: [PLUG] Action item: new Open source bill
Message-ID: <200305281358.16297.pundit@teleport.com>

Friends,

Sally at Rep. Barnhart's office says that it's time to "turn our 
tigers loose on the Senate."

An amendment has been proposed to SB 589 to change it from it was 
(an agricultural bill) into an open-source bill.  The language of 
the amended SB 589 is identical to what the amended version of 
HB2892 would have been had it lived.

The Chair of the committee hearing SB589 has consented to doing 
this, but the Senators on that committee need to hear support for 
the idea from their constituents before they're willing to vote 
it out.  Those Senators are:

Rick Metsger, Chair SD 26 (D-Welches) sen.rickmetsger at state.or.us 
Bruce Starr, vice-chair SD 15 (R-Hillsboro, Cornelius)
sen.brucestarr at state.or.us 
Ryan Deckert, SD 14 (D-Beaverton) sen.ryandeckert at state.or.us 
David Nelson, SD 29 (R-Pendleton) sen.davidnelson at state.or.us

We need support from at least three of these four to get the bill 
out of committee.  All four have already heard from Phil Barnhart 
and have a copy of the amendment, with several pieces of 
background material, in hand.  They understand what the bill is 
about and just need to hear from their constituents that there is 
support for it in their districts.

Considering the piece that ran in last Sunday's Oregonian, this is 
an excellent time to call or write to your State Senator about 
amending and passing out SB 589.

To quote you:

"Well, I don't know where the hell you've been working because I've 
never seen as much waste in MY 20-year career as I saw at ODOT.  
Nobody there ever has to work very hard.  My co-workers spent at 
least two hours of their workdays, every day, socializing with 
friends and taking care of personal business.  One even had his 
wife bring the dog into work every day, where he spent 
(typically) an hour or so playing with it and walking it!  I'd 
say that in a typcal day most of us only did maybe three or four 
hours of real work.

We had to drive to Coquille, or Medford, or any number of other 
far-away places 2-3 times per week to fix some stupid Windoze 
problem that could have been handled remotely if ODOT had been a 
'nix shop.  And in many cases, we were fixing the same problem 
we'd already fixed a week or two earlier.

And THAT, sir, is why I approached Rep. Barnhart with the proposal 
to write HB 2892.  I've worked at ODOT, I've seen the waste, and 
I figured that what I saw was only the tip of the State 
government iceberg.

Yes Ed, you are the one and if I would have remembered whom it was that
mentioned it I would have given you credit (my bad - many apologies).

I really do believe that OSS will win on merit and I can see steady
progress of this. As Mr. Barber states, I currently work in an MS shop
(indirectly) and I can see management accepting and positioning for
open-source. Getting the troops to follow in suit is going to happen but
it is a slow process, as everything in state government is. I for one
would like to win the war with the weapons that we have now, and those
coming soon, and not with legislated advantage - call me a glutton for
punishment but the tools rock and I have faith in the community at large
to see this and develop it.

I've introduced at least one agency to a thing called CVS for their dev
teams and it looks like they will be using it, possibly wide spread
throughout the state. This isn't much but it beats babysitting VSS or
paying the big bucks for Clear Case. This being said, I respectfully
disagree.

I should rephrase this partially incorrect statement. OSS will win the
desktop battle when some of the desktop productivity applications
mature. I hope that reads a little better since I know that the server
applications are, with a few exceptions, top of the line.

I found his insinuations that I somehow had no idea how to manage an
enterprise Unix farm personally offensive and his little rant about a
co-worker walking a dog nothing more than small minded FUD designed to
damage and cause discontent. All you had to do is live the same 3 years
that I did in the middle of dotcom and you would have seen the real
meaning of waste, those of you that saw this too - you have my deepest
sympathy. And yes Ed, anytime someone stoops to an SCO class
unsubstantiated FUD it deserves the sleaze award. 

I'll be the first one to admit that I may have been harsh on Ken and I
apologize to all of you that I may have offended in being that way but
even the friendliest of dogs will bite when provoked. As far as the bill
and what it appeared to be in the beginning, I am certain that it was a
lot of effort and I have, and will, commend and respect anyone that
feels strongly enough about this technology to go to that distance, as
long as it's done with integrity. Unfortunately, that last comment about
one bad experience at the state which led him to author the bill makes
me feel like supporting 2892 is supporting someones personal vendetta.
Sorry, I need to continue to focus on supporting open-source, not
someones personal agenda.

Or... you can use Alan Stebbin's ackmail.rc, which I find more powerful than
`vacation'. If you've got procmail, then you need nothing else.
Unfortunately, I was unable to find it on the web just now. But... since I
have it, and it's GPL'd, you can now find it on my web site...

    http://www.herring.org/techie.html#procmail

The comments at the beginning are pretty clear on how to set it up. e.g.,
from my .procmailrc at work, I do this...

###
#Variables used by ackmail.rc
MY_ADDR=Sandy_Herring at adp.com
MY_NAMES="Sandy Herring|sherring|Sandy_Herring"
NOACKFILE=$HOME/vacation.noack
ACKMSG=$HOME/.ack.msg
VACAMSG=$HOME/vacation.msg
FROMSIG="Sandy Herring <Sandy_Herring at adp.com>"
MUA=default

INCLUDERC=$HOME/ackmail.rc


Note that ${NOACKFILE} is a flat file composed of regexps of addresses you
don't want to ack. e.g.

    plug-admin at lists\.pdxlinux\.org
    \.ru
    eudoramail\.com
etc.

To activate it, just create your vacation message ($HOME/vacation.msg in my
case). To deactivate it, rm or rename your vacation message. It builds a
cache of email addresses to whom it's replied and limits the acks to one a
day to each email address.

hth,
Sandy

I'm not sure if this answers your exact question, but
to make it so normal users can smbmount shares, you
need to set the following permissions:

  chmod 4755 /usr/bin/smbmnt
  chmod 4755 /usr/bin/smbumount
  chmod 755 /usr/bin/smbmount

At this point we should probably be referring to it as SB 589. Of

I think your syntax is wrong for smbmount:


  smbmount //server/share /mountpoint -o
username=username%password

I'd say this one's had more than enough!

But SB589 has some merit. If someone OSS friendly was on the policy
board and the language was inclusive of Oregon Technology Corporations
it would be well worth the effort.

For those that haven't found it yet:

http://www.leg.state.or.us/03reg/measures/sb0500.dir/sb0589.intro.html

It's raw but has some potential to be powerful.

And yet it's pretty obvious to everyone reading this thread, that you have

Maybe I missed something, but I read his "dog walking" story as
personal observation specifically countering your claim ("... the fact
that ODOT is already running leaner than any IT shop that I've worked
with in my 20 year career."), rather than attack.  Anyway, from my
reading, it was logically separate from the justification for the
bill.

Again, I read the reason for the bill as the twice weekly trips to
Medford and Coquille to fix silly Windows box problems, not the dog
walking episode.

At a macro level, I see no rational legitimate public-interest
justification for opposing this bill as amended.  One argument against
it here seems to be that it won't save any money immediately.  Maybe
not.  But the sooner people start converting _the sooner_ the money
can be saved.  Either in licensing costs or people costs, or more
likely both.  In "net present value" terms for the future cash flow,
that is still a win that gets smaller the longer it is delayed.  That
argues for starting now.  Even if no one gets laid off, there is an
opportunity cost to having IT staff driving to Coquille twice a week,
when they could be working on more productive problems and returning
more public-interest value for the money spent.  And lastly, on the
savings issue, even if there is none in dollar terms, there is the
matter of where the dollars that _are_ spent land: in the wallets of
your neighbor Oregon employees or in the overflowing bank accounts of
Redmond WA and similar locations.

Well, there's a couple of quiet individuals on this list that know
better. In fact, I had several meetings with a boss or two about
supporting it even with the "Avoid" language that was originally in it.
But hey, at the end of the day I still support and deploy Linux products
in ODOT.

I have a P133 with 32M ram laptop (an old Micron Millenia Transport) running 
gentoo - I was lucky enough to have a cluster to compile with this last time, 
but the first time I compiled XFree it took close to 30 hours. It was not 
necessary that I use it during this time, so I did not need it and the 
compile time was not a problem for me.. My windowmanager on this is 
WindowMaker - it is surprisingly quick on this heavy, slow, old (but 
reliable) beast. Speaking of which, anyone have a battery for this model they 
would want to sell? ;-)

One thing that can save you a lot of time with an older system is to use a 
"stage3" install - this basically means you don't bootstrap your system (and 
you use precompiled glibc and gcc for your platform - they are generally 
optimized for each generation of processor.)

There are also precompiled packages available for KDE, Xfree, Gnome, 
OpenOffice.org, etc.. (All the biggies..)

None the less, it was really mean spirited to use this sort of example
and it really miffed me that the only observation of government waste
presented here was something that can't be substantiated but is
irritating to all. I think that's probably what torqued me about it.

This is exactly why I do what I do. From the inside it's better for me
to be quiet about the bill but when I'm asked for an honest perspective
of where I see open-source deployment costs at this time I am going to
give it up. I understand that folks are free to beat on me for being
honest all they want but I'm not going to sit back and quietly get
kicked. 

<RELATIVELY_NON-OFFENSIVE_RANT>
ODOT IT folks maintain a network of MS products. In the year that I've
been at ODOT my NT workstation has not locked up once (and I'm a heavy
Visio user), the core infrastructure services have been stable as a rock
and I don't remember the last time I dropped a file share (including the
Windows SMB shares that I mount on my 6 Linux systems). You can't
maintain that kind of stability by being lazy idiots, it's simply not
possible. Even though the FUD is not pointed directly at me it's still
wrong to leave any group with a rotten impression of good folks you
don't even know. 

As for me, I work quietly in ODOT's mainframe group (Mr. Barber, you
were curious about where the hell I worked). In addition to the normal
engine count expected for a production z/800, this mainframe contains a
full-on IFL engine that services nothing but z/VM and Linux, it's
capable of concurrently running more Linux servers in that one small
cabinet than we could fit in a data center at about the same cost as 4
Intel rack-mount servers. I commute from Portland to Salem, put in my 9
hours for you and commute home to crack the books and talk to the wife.
I think you might be able to see now why I take offense to folks
grinding their ax with ODOT in an effort to push a political agenda.
</RELATIVELY_NON-OFFENSIVE_RANT>

BTW; If anyone is still interested in technology, I'm struggling a
little bit with our virtual hipersockets interfaces advertising all
zeros for their MAC addresses. It only seems to be picking up zeros to
Linux (/sbin/ifconfig -a) but the hipersockets network seems to see a
MAC for the connected systems. Since it's virtual to z/VM and only used
for Linux servers it's not exposed to the WAN (yet) but the technology
runs about twice as fast as the OSA IO layer so I would love to use it.
Any ideas folks?

It's an odd situation, isn't it?  Linux gurus at every corner with "will
grep for food" signs and yet American companies act as though they can't
find qualified tech workers without going outside our borders.

I've had a chance to hear both sides of this seeming paradox.  There is
simultaneously a shortage of work and a shortage of talented workers. 
It's weird, really.

Again, I feel the best explanation is that much of the the open source
talent pool simply isn't offering what the market is looking for. 

The market is not looking for free (as in freedom) nor free (as in
beer).  The market is looking for easy (as in to use) and familiar (as
in brand names). Technical excellence will not carry the day... stronger
focus on human factors in communications and product design will.  

If the state government needs HB 2802 / SB 589 to evaluate software
intelligently, so be it.  I suppose it takes laws to do just about
anything in state government.

But the larger prize of Northwest business IT dollars will not be won by
activism, legislation, nor by technical distinction.  Business (and
jobs) will come around to open source only when we have begun to
communicate clearly and become more focused on effective marketing.

The ball's in our court, really.

Is this even possible:

Install a 256MB PC100 SDRAM module on a motherboard that supports
256MB PC100 SDRAM modules, and have it only detect 128MB?

I have what pretends to be such a case. My claim is that the modules in
question are not really a 256MB modules despite what the labels say.
The company that sold them to me claims that it's just not the right part
for the particular motherboard. The correct part (surprise) costs nearly
twice as much.

I installed one of the suspect parts in a second PC that has a completely
different motherboard. It also only saw only 128MB. I installed a known
256MB module from the second PC in to the first PC, and it saw 256MB.
This all reinforces my belief that the claimed 256MB modules are really
128MB modules. Technologically speaking, is there a chance in hell my
belief could be wrong?

Terry,
Technologically speaking, it appears that you've purchased a 128MB SDRAM
module in a 256MB package. Did you ask the supplier which motherboard
the suspect module was compatible with?

Here's something that just dawned on me. Do a google search on the part
number of the IC's mounted on the module. If you can get information on
the IC's you should be able to do the math and calculate the capacity of
the module.

Post the complete part number of the SDRAM devices, and their quantity.
With that info we can calculate the size of the module.

These are likely sdram modules with higher density dram chips. If the
motherboard chipset was designed only to read or be compatible with lower
density dram chips, it will indeed only recognize half the ram when you
insert a module with higher desnity dram chips. Also if one of the dram
chips is bad and your motherboard detects this it may disable half the ram
so as to preserve stability and not access the part of the ram module that
is bad. There are multiple reasons why you could see only 128 megs of a 256
meg chip.

Have you gone through the whole single-sided, double-sided thing? If not, here's 
a quick thumbnail--

There are issues with SS RAM not registering correctly in older boards that were 
designed during the double sided days. Some of the older documentation was 
oblivious to the SS DS issue. You can tell which ones were aware because they 
mention it. If they don't mention it, they're prob not SS compatible.

Well you see, that makes it all the more suspicious. When you go to their web site,
you can do both forward and reverse lookups. You can search on computer
make/model (or motherboard make/model) and get a listing of the memory modules
that will work. Or you can search on the part number of a memory module and get a
listing of all the computers and motherboards that will take it. But if you enter the
part number of *this* suspect memory module, it doesn't turn up at all. It only
appears on their main listing of available PC100 modules. So it's not clear what the
intended target is for this 256MB module.

So yes. That was going to be my next question to their support staff.

The module part number is conveniently hidden under the "warranty void if
removed sticker", but the part numbering on the individual chips does hint at
256M-bits each (0317LD C256BWP3208-7). The chip maker is LD (?).

I doubt the bad chip idea. Going four-for-four with one bad chip each seems
highly unlikely.

The chipset is Intel 440BX. Anyone happen to know what densities that would
support?

I agree with Mike, this looks like a Single Sided vs. Double Sided issue
(I believe most 440bx motherboards need DS to get to 256).  Really
stupid of the memory makers to sell SS PC100 to the public.

The phenomenon is not limited to Open Source versus non-Open
Source. In fact, at the time I visited the UAE, Saudi Arabia,
and other countries, Open Source was not mentioned as often
as technical competence in specific disciplines that are not
"sexy" to Americans. For example, assembly language, AC power,
circuit design, robotics, Pascal, cooling (knowledge of Venturi
effects), etc. Many of the firms that need these skills are not
in the computer business directly; for example, telecommunication
firms.

The computer industry seems to have dumbed down the work
force with its emphasis on plug and play, point and click,
abstract away the details attitudes. We're now losing jobs
to those "less fortunate" people who attended schools that
could not afford the latest technologies and had to suffer
through learning the details.

But I'm getting way off topic...

10 or 15 minutes with Google and I came up blank.  No one seems to know
who 'LD' is.  They certainly aren't a well known manufacturer.  Judging
solely on the part number, I would say that the chip is a 32M x 8.  There
should be 8 devices forming a single bank of 32M x 64.

The Intel info on the 440BX says that the 82443BX C-1 stepping is capable
of supporting 128 Mb chips.  There is no mention of 256 Mb parts.  I think
that if you want 256 MB in a single slot, you will need a "double sided"
(two banks) module.  Even with that, your BIOS will need to have the
appropriate support.

WHY THE BEST NEWS FOR LINUX IS STILL TO COME
     (Source: LinuxWorld.com) While conspiracy theories are fun,
Joe Barr is certain of two things. One is that Linux is going to
continue its inexorable march to the desktop. The second is the
Microsoft monopoly will not go gentle into that good night.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742452

UPDATE: MUNICH CHOOSES LINUX OVER MICROSOFT
     (Source: LinuxWorld.com) It's final. After several months of
intensive research and debate, the Munich city government has
decided to migrate its entire computer network to the open source
Linux operating system, dropping Microsoft Corp.'s Windows system
in the process.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742453

APACHE GROUP ISSUES UPDATE, WARNS OF SECURITY HOLE
     (Source: LinuxWorld.com) As with its last software update,
the Apache Software Foundation said that 2.0.46 was the 'best
version of Apache available' and recommended that users of prior
Apache versions upgrade.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742454

UPDATE: NOVELL HITS BACK AT SCO ON UNIX CLAIMS
     (Source: LinuxWorld.com) Novell said it never transferred
the copyrights and patents of Unix System V when it sold the
software to SCO in 1995. SCO responds saying that doesn't matter.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742455

UPDATE: SCO TURNS A PROFIT HELPED BY LICENSING PROGRAM
     (Source: LinuxWorld.com) The SCO Group reported a profit in
its second fiscal quarter thanks in part to its recently launched
initiative to more aggressively collect licensing fees for its
Unix operating system software.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742456

LOOKING AT YOUR APACHE LOG FILES
     (Source: ITworld.com) Sysadmins responsible for web site
management generally have one of two approaches to dealing with
their log files: 1) they never look at the files unless something
breaks and they want to see if the log files provide any
insights, or 2) they feed their log files to a program such as
Analog that turns the data in these logs into a series of useful
graphs and tables.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742457

GERMAN SOFTWARE GROUP THREATENS TO SUE SCO ON LINUX
     (Source: InfoWorld.com) A German software group on Wednesday
threatened to take U.S. software firm SCO Group to court if it
did not withdraw from a worldwide attack on Linux, the free
computer operating system.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742458

GREAT WALL OF LINUX ON TAP FROM SYMANTEC, IBM
     (Source: Network World Fusion) Symantec last week announced
the release of its Enterprise Firewall for IBM's eServer iSeries
270 running Linux. Formerly known as the AS/400 server family,
IBM has been offering Linux as an option on its RISC-based
iSeries hardware platform for several years.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742459

HIPAA VS MICROSOFT'S EULA: WHICH WINS?
     (Source: ITworld.com) Using Microsoft's Windows XP or
Windows 200 Server gives Microsoft permission to examine
computers using the software at any time. On the other hand,
HIPAA rules demand computer systems be kept from any unauthorized
access, whether medical data will be read as part of the access
or not.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742460

PREPARE FOR INCREASED DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT
     (Source: ITworld.com) Like it or not, digital rights
management is in our future. Sysadmins of Linux, NetWare,
Solaris, or anything else better get ready to replace them all
with Windows Servers or offer their own digital rights management
technology options.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742461

SCO-MICROSOFT CONSPIRACY THEORY
     (Source: LinuxWorld.com) The SCO vs. IBM lawsuit gives off a
subtle, unpleasant odor Our Hero couldn't quite place. When SCO
set its sights on Linux distributors and even Linux itself, the
source of the stench became unmistakable -- Redmond. A humorous
look at a a potential smoking gun.

In addition to all the signle-sided vs dual-sided issues, it IS possible that
the chip is bad: I once had a 256M SDRAM chip which, after one reboot was
detected by the BIOS as 128M chip. I moved it to a different slot, and it
was 256M again, but soon after that it stopped being 256M in any slot (and
in other motherboards too, it was only detected as 128M). As 128M it still
works fine, and memtest86 reports no errors on it.

The differing numbers following the '#' indicate the source port on

What's likely happening is that you've got a Win2K or XP machine
that's trying to do dynamic DNS updates. There's a point-and-drool
method for disabling that behavior, but the exact procedure escapes me
just now.

YES!


I just recently went to upgrade the memory in my 440BX-chipset
motherboard.  I didn't think it was that old, but then realized I bought
it in 1998!  I had a single 128MB stick which clearly is not enough
nowadays.  I went down to ENU and bought a 256MB PC133 stick and installed
it.  It only said I had 256MB total!  Removing the original said it was
back at 128!  Tried new stick in a VIA chipset motherboard and sure
enough, it read 256MB.
I consulted ENU and he said it was not a single- vs. double-sided issue,
but what he called "high-density" vs "low-density".  Lucky for me they had
what I needed, a 256MB low-density stick (which BTW was double-sided). 
Now the BX board has 384MB of memory, the new 256 and original 128.

See if they will exhchange it for low-density memory, or get a refund
altogether and buy from ENU.  On an unrelated note, this situation is why
I almost always buy locally.  It's much easier to do returns I find and
after shipping it isn't worth saving the few bucks only to wait longer to
receive it.

I could swear I saw this matter discussed a week or three ago on the PLUG
list. It has something to do with the changes in architecture that make it
RH9 instead of RH8.1

I'm sorry I don't remember all the technical details. I think it was
something about memory allocation or interrupt handling. RealPlayer8 can't
handle RH9's scheme, but I think there's a kernel compilation option that
will tell your kernel to work in a RP-compatible manner.

Too bad RealNetworks won't provide you the Sourcecode for their player. You
could recompile it instead and enjoy both their fine media player and the
more modern kernel design. You might also check with Real to see if they
have a new binary posted for RH9 users.

Again, I apologize for my vagueness; I've been messing-around with Redmond's
finest software products too much this week.

I'm sorry I didn't post this here sooner.

The Accelerated Learning Center is offering a course
geared to those who want to learn Linux and are also
interested in becoming Linux-certified. If you've
shopped around for certification training, you know
it's expensive. The ALC course is less expensive and
achieves this with a hybrid of classroom time and
self-study.

The course is a 5 day/5 week course. Students meet in
the classroom every Monday (all day) for 5 weeks. On
the remainder of the days each week, students do guided
lab exercises on their own computers at home or at work,
thus reinforcing what they learned in the classroom.
Students have access to the instructor any time via email
and instant messaging.

You can get more information here:

You'll need the "LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1" hack. See

PPC is (probably for you) a different platform. PowerPC chips are the CPUs
in Macintosh and some IBM computers. They operate with different code than
Intel chips.

We just went through this during ALCPress' (Ed Sawicki) DNS Bootcamp.

Briefly:

Start, Settings, Network Connections, (Your) Connection, [Right Click],
Properties, [Select TCP/IP], Properties, Advanced, DNS, (at the bottom of

This same thing hit me a couple years ago when I was trying to support an
early PocketPC-based handheld. LD is not really LD. It's a Korean company
whose logo looks like the Latin alphabet's L and D. In order to keep from
being thoroughly helpful, I must admit that I don't remember the name of
that company.

I seem to be having a caffeine shortage today.

The Accelerated Learning Center is offering a course
geared to those who want to learn Linux and are also
interested in becoming Linux-certified. If you've
shopped around for certification training, you know
it's expensive. The ALC course is less expensive and
achieves this with a hybrid of classroom time and
self-study.

The course is a 5 day/5 week course. Students meet in
the classroom every Monday (all day) for 5 weeks. On
the remainder of the days each week, students do guided
lab exercises on their own computers at home or at work,
thus reinforcing what they learned in the classroom.
Students have access to the instructor any time via email
and instant messaging.

We're using simple HTTP redirects. If some browsers don't
work with redirects, I'd certainly want to know about it.

We already know that Microsoft's IE 6 doesn't work when
a web site has more than one A record and if the first
server that IE contacts is not running, IE will not try
the second. So, it wouldn't surprise me.

INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERS (IEEE) OREGON SECTION
                PACE (PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES) MEETING

TOPIC:       Open Source IP Licensing - What You Should Know
SPEAKER:    Marcy L. Edwards, VP & General Counsel, PSC Inc.
DATE:        Thursday, May 29, 2002
TIME:         6:30 PM - 8:00 PM
                 Doors open 6:00PM
LOCATION:  Oregon Graduate Institute(OGI),
                 Wilson Center Main Dining Room
                 See directions below.
COST:        FREE and open to the public
REGISTRATION: http://www.ieee-or.org/events

This PACE meeting of the IEEE Oregon Section will discuss licensing issues
for Open Source intellectual property (IP). This is the follow-on meeting
from our September 2002 meeting on IP Licensing. Attendees should have
attended that meeting or have solid understanding of the framework of
intellectual property legal protections.

Abstract:

IP is the new buzzword for anything designed or created by engineers.
Software, hardware designs, HDL code, specifications, knowledge, etc. are
all types of IP. Open Source is an increasingly popular method to distribute
software to the market. Engineers are leveraging the Open Source concept for
other types of IP, such as HDL cores. But what happens if you use some Open
Source IP in your design? Does that make your entire design subject to Open
Source rules? What if you use some Open Source function in your software -
do you have to reveal all your source code too?

What are the rules of the game? How can you license your IP for best
advantage? What if you want to license IP from someone else for use in your
product? How can you take advantage of Open Source without giving away
everything?

Marcy Edwards will address these and other issues of Open Source IP
licensing in this talk. She has many years of experience with technology
licensing, intellectual property, internet and privacy issues.  Her
presentation will include insights on the following licensing topics:

  .  Nondisclosures
  .  Clear title/ownership/assignment of IP
  .  Assignment/licensing to third parties
  .  Development & Integration with third party products
  .  Implications in the use of Open Source and Linux O/S
  .  The importance of proper licensing
  .  Consequences of improper licensing

Speaker:

Marcy L. Edwards currently serves as V.P. & General Counsel of PSC Inc. PSC
provides innovative data-collection solutions for the retail supply chain
worldwide.  Its range of products includes mobile and wireless data-capture
terminals, warehouse management software, self-checkout systems, and
fixed-position and handheld bar code scanners. Headquartered in Portland,
Oregon, PSC has major manufacturing facilities in Eugene, Oregon, as well as
sales and service offices throughout the Americas, Europe, Asia and
Australia.

Prior to joining PSC almost two years ago, Ms. Edwards founded and ran a
private practice known as TechKnowledge Legal Counsel, LLC. Previous to
having her own practice, she was with the international law firm, LeBoeuf
Lamb Greene & MacRae where she was an integral member of the Intellectual
Property & Internet Practice Group that transitioned to the Preston Gates
Ellis law firm when LeBoeuf left the Portland area.  Ms. Edwards has
practiced law in Oregon and Washington for over 20 years and is very
familiar with Technology Licensing & Transactions, Intellectual Property,
Internet, and Privacy issues at the local, national, and international
levels.  She continues to operate her private practice on a part-time basis
for special clients with PSC's consent.

Ms. Edwards developed her strong background in corporate transactional
matters, technology issues, and the emerging areas of Internet Law and
Privacy law while serving as corporate counsel with Portland-based
technology companies over a period of 10 years.  She served as Analogy,
Inc.'s Corporate Counsel and Corporate Secretary from 1991 until 1998. While
at Analogy, she experienced the growth of a high-tech company from shortly
after the start-up stage through a successful IPO.  Prior to her position
with Analogy, Ms. Edwards was a Corporate Attorney with Mentor Graphics
Corporation for three years where she provided legal support to the
international offices of the corporation and negotiated third party
licensing arrangements.  Ms. Edwards also draws on her litigation and
transactional experience from private practice in the 1980's and her
litigation training with the Washington Attorney General's Office and the
U.S. Department of Justice.

Directions to Oregon Graduate Institute (OGI):

The meeting will be held in the main dining room of the Wilson Clark Center
on the campus of the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology,
20000 NW Walker Rd., Beaverton, OR 97006  (503) 748-1121. See

Amen, Dylan.

In other words, competence no longer matters.  One's skills, 
knowledge and ability to do a particular job no longer matter.  
What matters is how socially well-connected one is:  who one 
knows, and how well one knows them.

This is the very kind of world that Ayn Rand warned against half a 
century ago in her novels "The Fountainhead" and "Atlas Shrugged" 
and now it's coming to pass in the high-tech sector.

I got into this line of work two decades ago because, among other 
things, it was one of the few remaining fields where excellence 
still mattered -- and I practice excellence in everything I do.

There are certain places (such as a state agency where I once 
worked) where this makes me unpopular.  Sometimes I wonder if 
I'll ever find work again....

In Atlas Shrugged, the parasitic leech was government attaching itself 
to business to stiffle innovation. OSS is still innovating and there are 
lots of businesses (Merrill Lynch, Amazon, Dreamworks etc.) who are 
using OSS to compete. It's not just about marketing, Businesses will 
wake up and smell the coffee when they realize another company is eating 
their lunch by using better cheaper software. It wasn't marketing that 
woke Detroit up to TQM, it was the Japanese.

I have a directory that I wanted to move, and I used an ash shell (from 
the debian CD) to do it, as root.  Evidently this was mistake, because 
not all the files were moved, or moved properly (though I've no idea why 
not), and now I've two directories that I need to merge.  ash really 
blows, by the way.

How should I do this?  If I use mv now, it fails because the directory 
exists in the new location.  If I use cp, even with all the flags that 
seem appropriate, I get all kinds of errors saying it can't create hard 
links between file x and file y.  I don't know why it would want to, 
because x and y are different filenames, so I'm really confused here. 
rsync would probably do it, but I'm working from a rescue system 
(different shell this time) and don't have rsync at my command.

I've experienced this problem before, too, so I'd like to get to the 
bottom of it.  How to merge two dir's using a basic shell?  Why ash 
couldn't move the whole directory in the first place is incidental.

Thank you,

Jason Van Cleve


P.S.  Did I mention ash sucks?

Subject: [PLUG] Yellow Dog Linux on an old-world SCSI Mac
Message-ID: <200305291248.06728.pundit@teleport.com>

After weeks of aggravation, I finally got Yellow Dog 3 to 
successfully start up on a beige PowerMac G3 tower.

I don't know if I should clog up the lists with grisly details, so 
here's a short version:

The problem occurs when installing YDL 3 onto a SCSI drive in a 
Mac with the old-world ROM.  Terrasoft forgot to include SCSI 
drivers in the "BootX" kernel!

It's maddening because the SCSI drivers ARE there in the 
install-time kernel -- but as soon as the install is finished you 
get a kernel panic when the runtime kernel tries to mount the 
drive.

To make a long story short, I installed YellowDog to a temporary 
IDE drive, recompiled the kernel for SCSI support and then copied 
the new kernel onto both the SCSI drive (where YDL had already 
been installed) and the MacOS partition (which is where Linux 
actually boots from if you have an old-world ROM).

More details available to anyone who asks.

Oh yeah, by the way-- since Yellow Dog 3 is just RedHat 8.0 
recompiled for the PPC architecture, it has all of RedHat's bugs, 
including the maddening little RPM bug that RedHat never fixed in 
version 8.

Well -- sort of.  Not really.

The real parasites were business executives -- James Taggart, 
Orren Boyle and a host of others -- that didn't want to compete 
with innovators such as Hank Rearden.  So they had their "man in 
Washington" begin taking action at the legislative level.

Government was only doing what it was being pressured to do by 
what (in the real world) might be called "industry lobbyists."

Excellent point.  Maybe there's hope.  I surely would like to find

If you've got tar, you can pipe tar-to-tar:

  tar -C <srcdir> -cl . | tar -C <destdir> -xpv

This will stomp on files that you have changed in <destdir> though, so
be careful if that is the case.

I recently install Debian on a PowerMac 7500/100 from their
debian-30r1-powerpc-binary-1.iso.  This went relatively smoothly (heh,
like polished glass) compared to my attempt to install on the old
68030-based PowerBook 180c, which is still floundering for lack of a
suitable kernel, where suitable is defined as providing drivers
necessary to use the keyboard and that also allows init to startup the
system.

First off, I'm not doubting your Linux creds.

The point was that you said you couldn't support the bill because you
believed it to be part of a "personal agenda", while at the same time you
were acting on a personal agenda of your own. It's pretty clear that you
see the bill as a vendetta against ODOT and it's employees. It also clear
that, to some degree, you take that personally. I'm guessing that is why
you made fifteen postings, in this thread alone, arguing against a *dead*
bill. The end result is you appear to be criticizing others for something
you are doing your self.

Furthermore, you were criticizing the bill based on the intentions of the
author, rather than on the text of the bill. That sort of maneuver
actually hurts your argument more than it helps. Ken's intentions are of
little consequence in this situation - what matters is the content of the
bill. The only time his intentions would become an issue would be if they
were expressed in the proposed law. Unless you can point to a clause that
pointlessly hurts the State, the argument fails.

Please note that none of this is intended to be personal criticism. It is
just my take on that particular argument.

Best of luck on your work at ODOT,
Dan

A DEFINING MOMENT


Once all the lawyers have finished having their fun with the SCO vs. IBM
madness, what will they do for an encore? After a long look in my
crystal ball, here's my prediction for the next episode of intellectual
property terrorism:

BELLEVUE, WA, July 15, 2004 -- Semi-Unabridged Webster Corp., publishers
of the Semi-Unabridged Webster Dictionary of 1923, today announced it
has granted a license of English language intellectual property rights
to Microsoft Corporation. The licensing deal makes Microsoft the first
company to ensure its products and services will be in copyright
compliance with the use of English.

"We are very grateful for Microsoft's acknowledgement of our
intellectual property rights and for their support in our efforts to
make English available to all for a reasonable licensing fee," said
Preston Gates Ellis, CEO and General Counsel for the recently-formed
Semi-Unabridged Webster (SUW).  Ellis acknowledged that Microsoft
received a particularly favorable licensing due to its "small
investment" in his company, but declined to provide detailed numbers.

A Microsoft spokesman said the company will not participate in the
lawsuit SUW recently filed against AOL/Time-Warner for copyright
infringement over its use of English in various media properties. "This
move is just representative of Microsoft's commitment to respecting
intellectual property and its healthy exchange through licensing," the
spokesman said.

Ellis reiterated his earlier statements that SUW does not claim to have
intellectual property rights to the entire English language, but that
"crucial words and usages have been appropriated in clear violation of
our rights." He declined to give specific examples of such infringement,
as that might aid in helping the infringers disguise their culpability.
"The best guideline we can offer at this point is that, if you want to
use English, you need a license."

Legal observers have pointed out that other dictionary publishers also
have rights to use the Webster name, but SUW is in a unique position
because its dictionary was published in 1923.  Due to the Sonny Bono
Copyright Term Extension Act, all previous dictionaries have entered
into the public domain, leaving the long out-of-print Semi-Unabridged
Webster tome with priority as the oldest copyrighted lexicon.

SUW Corp., which acquired rights to the dictionary shortly after forming
earlier this year, plans no legal actions against individual users of
English until after its lawsuits with AOL/Time Warner and possibly other
media conglomerates are settled. "We would suggest, however, that
everyone be mindful of today's announcement in that regard," Ellis
added. "At this point, for example, it should be understood that MSN is
the only on-line service that is legally authorized to send or receive
e-mail messages written in English."

Ellis also reacted angrily to critics who've suggested his company is
just a legal stalking horse for Microsoft and not actually a dictionary
publisher. "We are in the dictionary business, and we will prove that by
putting out an update of the 1923 edition in the near future to further
extend our intellectual property rights." He also refuted claims that
SUW is threatening lawsuits only against those who are critical of it or
Microsoft. "We absolutely believe in everyone's right to speak their
mind freely," he stated. "But those who are unwilling to acknowledge of
rights of legitimate copyright holders shouldn't use our language to do so."

Hello Linux folkz,
Does somebody know about possible solution 
to store XML formatted documents in SQL DB 
on Linux?
Our company is in need for document storage
server. 
We have Linux server with MySQL DB server and 
set of Perl applications and FCGI scripts to collect, 
analyze and plot engineering and process data right 
in a browser window.
I think, that it's a good idea to store pre-formatted
XML documents right in DB. 
The question is how to format and manage sich a 
collection of documents.
Mickysoft has some XML documents management 
system. Is there something similar in Linux world?

Thank you in advance for any ideas or sources of information.

Alex

  Why, they'll go to work for the "save the salmon industry" (Save the
salmon! Collect the whole set.)

  For those who are curious, the Biz Journal published one part of my

  The whole series is being published by an industry trade association in

You can use a blob data/field type in MySQL.

I might suggest using psql though. Are you hoping to extrace the data from
the xml files? or just store them in the database?

Robby,
We're planning to store technology related documents in DB with
possibility to display them on the intranet and link them for easy
searching.
Psql is much slower than MySQL and would be overkill for such tasks.

Alex,
I've been a fan of MySQL for a few years, but now I think PostgresSQL is
much more efficient for business use, not to mention it has more features
that MySQL doesn't...because they are mainly interested in speed.

You're not going to loose much speed pulling back a largeobject from psql
as you would pulling back a blob from mysql.

  Not only do I agree, but I'd like to point to SQLite, an embedded SQL
engine with features similar to both postgres and MySQL. Read all about it
in the June (2003) Linux Journal and here:
                      <http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/>

  I decided to use this for my contact manager and accounting system rather
than postgres. Don't ask me why for I do not consciously know. I _do_ know
that I put off these ports for about four years and now I'm burning the
midnight oil to get them done with sqlite. Go figure. It would be great if
more local folks used it so we could have our own support group. :-)

The question of storing XML in DB form is interesting to me (I'm in 
the middle of transitioning our technical documentation to DocBook 
using the XML DTD), so I poked around a bit. Here's a nice starting 
point:

* XML Database Products
  http://www.rpbourret.com/xml/XMLDatabaseProds.htm

His data are mostly correct, though one interesting project has been 
updated more recently that his table suggests:

* eXist
  http://exist.sourceforge.net/

This one, an Apache project, also looks interesting:

* Xindice
  http://xml.apache.org/xindice/

FYI: These are both Java-based projects, if that matters to you. They 
also both are based on some API-level work done at the XML::DB 
project: http://www.xmldb.org/

How local?  Spokane/Coeur d'Alene area local enough?  :-) I too am looking
at SQLite especially since there is a DBD driver for it.  Plus the
database is one file.  Put on a CDROM and access it from a Linux, UNIX, or
Win32 system.

Rod,

  Yup, that's close: only a 6-hour drive.

  I like the one-file with everything idea (just like my old, DOS databases)
and having it all in one binary. Nothing at all against PostgreSQL, but this
just strikes me as a very useful tool.

  I'm sure I'll have questions on implementing integrity constraints,
multi-field keys and so forth. I swallowed hard and joined the mail list on
yahoo groups, but there's been no traffic on it today. Kinda' like the glade
list.

I got the impression that Dylan was discussing the human factor in
software design rather than the human factor in the workplace, i.e.,
intuitive, pleasant interfaces, familiar vendors and support staff, and so
on.

As the great American philosopher John Dewey wrote, "Government is the
shadow cast by business on society."  We see this every day and, more
often than not, it goes by without comment.

The effects of this relationship are even less frequently acknowledged and
almost never recognized.  Clearly, attempts to alter society by reshaping
government are like attempts to push a person around by applying pressure
to their shadow.  Any change that does not address the underlying
relationship will have no long term effect.  If government is going to
carry out the will of the people (and as a public agency -- an agency of
the people, the people's agent -- that is exactly its intended purpose),
it must be independent of business.  If power MUST be consolidated, it
should be consolidated through a willfull and coordinated act of people,
not the accidental or shrewd machinations of a businessman.

Well, there's more to life than efficiency and effectiveness.  I
personally don't think it's a slap in the face of excellent quality of
life to have interests in the workplace beyond the creation and
maintenance of a flawlessly efficient wealth-reaper.

Remember that business, "the market", and the workplace are all systems
designed by human beings with the intent of improving the world and making
life more worth living.  Whenever they make things worse, they are
failing, regardless of the accountant's bottom line.

It seems that lately society has become dedicated to improving the economy
rather than the economy being dedicated to improving society.

Technical skill still matters and open source has much to be proud of. 
Small victories and tiny steps forward take place every day.  

But I don't buy that the importance of marketing is an indication that
the world is dissolving into a merit-free cesspool. 

The problem is that technology products are evaluated primarily by
people who don't understand the details.  If you provide your customers
with technical excellence, odds are they'll appreciate that to some
extent... but they really won't understand your excellence at anywhere
near the level of detail you practice it.  They have even less hope of
evaluating your excellence prior to using the product.

That's a bit of a catch-22, because it costs a **lot** for people to try
new systems.  Changing systems may not cost a lot of money, but it costs
a lot in terms of the things that actually matter to business:
productivity, predictability, exposure to risk.  

Overcoming this barrier requires far more than technical excellence, it
requires *inspiring confidence*.  Unfortunately for us, such skills are
(at best) orthogonal to technical skills.

Human factors play an enormous role in the conduct of business.  This
may suck, but it seems, in most cases, inescapable.  We may offer the
Reardon Metal of computing, but we just can't expect that the world is
going to notice unless we're prepared to tell our story.

Well, most of them were replies to what I saw as an untruthful attack on
me and my coworkers for honestly answering a question. Certainly I take
attacks on my skills personally, don't you? My problem is not with the
bill's language at all, I just feel deceived that the author used the
"Save Money, Promote OSS" soap box to advance a totally different
agenda.

I am sorry that you were left with this impression. I thought that I was
clear enough in stating that I was uncomfortable with OSS becoming the
next Affirmative Action recipient, this is my problem with the 2892
language. Also, I think that this thread displays that we are working
really hard and long in the trenches trying to sell Linux and OSS
solutions to the states business leaders, at least the ODOT IT
management have made it clear that they want it for it's cost cutting
potential. Some would argue that the legislative help would be good for
me, I just feel that it's unnecessary at this time, the decision makers
are open to the concept and mindful of what it brings.

I respect this, others opinions are valuable to me. I hope this clears
up some of the misconceptions about my view.

Thank you, I hope to share some more successes with the group soon.

By the way, IBM has a patch (PTF) for the hipersockets issue.

So suppose businesses do that, and design systems that improve the world 
and make life more worth living. Wouldn't it be good if that business 
then helps coordinate people and helps them wield consolidated power?

Kludgy?  As far as I know, before rsync this was _the_ way to copy
filesystem trees.

What is most likely happening is you have double density ram in a board
that only supports single density ram. 

There are two PC100 standards. Double density PC100 is not required to
be backward compatible with single density PC100. 

I ran into this exact problem with an Abit and an ASUS mainboard not too
long ago.

No.  You're thinking Intel architecture here.  There's no LILO, no 
Grub on a dual-boot Mac.

Old-world Macs have to partially boot into MacOS, then use 
something called BootX to load the linux kernel.  Because of 
this, the kernel has to reside on the MacOS partition.

Weird, huh?  This is all new to me.  The last time I used a Mac 
was well before Windoze 3.0 came out.

BootX does support kernel options though, so it should still be
possible, though the modules may need to be stored on the mac
partition.

Just a side note that may apply to others: There is a lilo-like boot
loader for _new_world_ macs, yaboot that works quite well and dosen't
require MacOS.

Steven, I give you credit for being persistent, but I can't make sense of
your argument with the bill which leads me to suspect your motivations
(sorry, but that is a natural consequence...)

Affirmative Action is a response to an inappropriate balance of power, in
this case the power over the marketplace of computing technologies. Either
you dissagree that there exists an imbalance or your dissagree with the
method for correcting it (or, as it often sounds, you just got caught up
in the personalization of it all). If you disagree with the method, then
you must have another method in mind, which I haven't really heard (aside
from your reference to ODOT's private/silent campaign? why not leverage
the larger hammer to get the job done right?).

Again, not being able to understand your method to get to the goal that
you claim to share with me (i.e., success of OSS, because it is good),
should I just conclude that you believe in "tough love" for OSS instead?
(Note: we agree that the free-market method to achieve the goal falls
apart when monopolies are involved, right?)

Robby,
Let me respectfully disagree with you on PostgreSQL vs MySQL issues.
I've worked with both databases and tested them throughfully in our
engineering environment over two year period. 
Finally our dept. decided to go with MySQL for all our engineering 
applications, data collection and statistical analysis. 
MySQL with InnoDB tables (which are ACID compliant) beats PostgreSQL
in terms of speed, number of simultaneous connections, security and
scalability. All these extended features in PostgreSQL as subqueries, stored 
procedures and such are easily implementable on the API level in Perl.
To pull data of 1,200.000 rows Mysql spends just about 3.5 seconds, 
PostgreSQL spends over 20 seconds on the same hardware.
We have no problem with over 250 simultaneous client connections to MySQL
server and  we had problems with PostgreSQL when number of simultaneous
connections reached just 80 on the same hardware.
MySQL takes a full benefit of RAID0, PostgreSQL doesn't have such an 
optimization. 

Regards.
Alex

Then things have changed a great deal since last August when a top 
ODOT IT official -- was it Marilyn Teleck?  I can't remember -- 
firmly told a bunch of us in a meeting that "there are NO plans 
to EVER deploy Linux at ODOT."  The tone of voice said further, 
"Don't ever ask again if you want to keep your job."

This is very good news.  Deborah Bryant (deputy CIO at DAS) told 
me a month ago that things had changed at ODOT but she didn't 
elaborate.  

Apparently DAS, who is a lot more OSS-friendly than ODOT was, has 
helped some of the entrenched bureaucrats in the latter "find 
religion."  

Thank you for sharing this news.  Too bad it didn't happen BEFORE 
I started writing the bill last fall, but oh well.

It's not part of the mandate right now.  There's nothing in it for the
bigwigs.  It requires long-term (like posterity) considerations that are
far beyond most people's decision-making capacity.  That's basically the
reason why consolidated power is a bad thing.  Obviously, it can be used
to actively oppress people and that's bad.  But it is also bad because it
allows for greater effectiveness and efficiency.  If a single person
wielding a single person's power makes a mistake, the repercussions are
usually small and the system can adapt and compensate.  If a mistake is
made with massive amounts of consolidated power, you get premature
extinction, rivers catching fire, poverty, and war.

tar to tar piping is a very standard method for moving shit around.  I
wouldn't call it kludgy at all.

I remember reading that somewhere, now you mention it.  (There was a
note about using compression with it to speed up network backups.)
Still, it _looks_ kludgy to me, given that the tar info page introduces
it as an archiver and not a copy program, and because you have to pipe
the command back to itself.

Of course this fits the whatever-works flavour of *nix, where less is
more, and to rename is to mv.  So I can dig it.  I just hope tar is
there for me if I have this problem again. . . .

It's encouraging. We're gaining ground, there's a lot more work to do
but there are a small (but growing) number of us that are dedicated to
making it happen. For example, I just got news this afternoon that
another agency wants to make use of Linux 3270 services starting on the
magic date of July 1. This will allow them to avoid buying the latest
and greatest XP compliant emulator software for all of these users.

All in all it is really interesting. When business units start seeing
that they can run services under Linux on the z/800 they see it through
a totally different set of eyes. They get IO performance and stability
that they see as unsurpassed ( I'm starting to agree with them on that
one ) and centralized configuration management they warm up to the whole
OS change pretty fast. It really is selling itself to some units and I
am sure that more will follow - the decision makers and technologists
really are intelligent people.

Thank you for this perspective Alex (and Robby, too). I am at a point in
this project where I must choose between MySQL and PostgreSQL. Up until
this point, MySQL wasn't a contender because it didn't have
transactions. But now it does and, from what you are saying, it is
significantly faster than PostgreSQL.

So a question to you, Alex (and to the assembled masses). The financial
part of my app wants transactions (of course). But the other part of my
app is going to be using some linear algebra equations and I would like
my table to be memory resident. Is this practical with the latest
versions of MySQL?

Also, I haven't done any "real" programming of MySQL yet, but my
intention is to be driving it off a Java servlet. Do you have any ideas
on how it will perform using JDBC?

Thanks,
- -Ron

ps, This group, PLUG, is incredibly helpful - even to those of us who
mostly lurk.

pps, Novell has made a comeback in my book to relevance with how they
have stood up to SCO. I hope ALL of us become familiar with what their
Linux plans are and, when their Linux products are ready, will seriously
consider - and use - them in our designs.

If you want to pay big $$$, sure, go with Oracle.
The question is how you would justify Oracle cost and
its licenses cost to your management if you can get 
nearly the same for free?

Ron,
MySQL supports some linear algebra equations embedded in queries
which don't require to run subqueries. 
All complicated stuff you can easily implement on the level of API.
MySQL has IHOP table format which resides in memory (RAM), 
though it doesn't support indexing.
We use IHOP tables to create temporary tables when we run complicated
subqueries. 
My personal observation is that if you run subquery, using its API 
implementation in MySQL and IHOP as temporary tables, it runs much faster 
with less overhead that the same subquery entered directly in PostgreSQL. 
Assuming the same amount of data to be pulled and the same hardware.
You can use JDBC with MySQL, but what for?
Perl provides much better API for MySQL than anything else, especially if
you implement it as FCGI over your intranet .

Regards.
Alex

So we wouldn't want systems that are designed to improve the world to 
have greater effectiveness and efficiency? Because there's some strictly 
deterministic cosmic law that ties consolidation of power to burning rivers?

I guess I'm not talking about mandates for far off bigwigs. I'm talking 
about "us". I'm talking about improving the world ourselves. It's kinda 
like the distinction between grousing about politics as opposed to 
writing a bill like SB 589 and shepherding it through the legislature. 
We can start and run businesses that value long-term considerations. If 
we do it well, we'll show people a better way - which I believe is more 
convincing to most people than rhetoric and exhortations.

Yes, Oracle is a really superb database that runs really well on Linux.
But I can't afford it. And neither can any other small un(der)funded
startup. So we get to choose between MySQL and PostgreSQL.

Why use JDBC? Perhaps because the application is written in Java? Not to
start a flame war (I *really* don't want to do that), but I consider
Perl to be a really useful tool for easily solving most sysadmin tasks.
For serious software engineering, where the problem is both large and
highly complex (as in having to use linear algebra for a critical /part/
of the solution), I think that Java is really the only serious
cross-platform contender (which is a fundamental requirement).

So back to the second part of my question: How good is the JDBC support
on Linux for MySQL compared to PostgreSQL?

Or SAP DB or Firebird, both of which are open-source and reportedly of
good quality.

Ron,
I don't want to start flame war ether, but let me point out on 
this fact that Java applications are running differently on different
OS platforms due to differences in its VM implementations.
So Java's cross-platform compatibility is just a mere of definition of
what it is. Perl is also cross-platform compatible as well as a bunch
of other programming languages.
We were trying to use Java for our eng. purposes and finaly dropped
it. Performance wise it's lagged far behind Perl. 
For example, the same application written in Java was starting its VM
on HP-UX for nearly 30 seconds, on Sun Solaris it takes about 12
seconds, on Linux 2.4.x it takes about 7-8 seconds, on NT/2000/XP it
takes from 3-5 seconds. 
Answering your question - JDBC support on Linux for MySQL is very 
good as well as for PostgeSQL. We had no problem with it whatsoever.

Regards.
Alex

It has to do with the Threads libraries that RH9 has implemented. The
fix is in the RELEASE-NOTES... 

       If an application does not work properly with NPTL, it can be run
       using the old LinuxThreads implementation by setting the
following
       environment variable:

       LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=<kernel-version>

       The following versions are available:

       - 2.4.1 - Linuxthreads with floating stacks

       - 2.2.5 - Linuxthreads without floating stacks

       NPTL support for all dynamically-linked applications can be
disabled
       by using the following boot-time option:

       nosysinfo

I have an issue where nslookup will respond internally with no

It also works from an outside nslookup.. it shows the external ip of a

internally...it works fine.

Is there a setting that I am not aware of that needs to be set in my

Ok guys,

All this stuff sounds well and good, but what do you recommend for 
someone like me? I'm not interested in having to "learn" a bunch of 
stuff (I'm not a coder yet so I don't want to have to learn to code) 
but I'm pretty good with HTML. I have a data set that will be updated 
(sometimes frequently) and I want to separate the content from the page 
layout as much as possible and generate the pages on the fly. It will 
be served either from my OS X machine or the 2k Server machine.

I kind of figured that XML would be the way to go since I'm familiar 
with HTML already, but I've had people say that XML is lots of work and 
that I should go with some sql/perl/php configuration.

Who should I believe? Do I need to just learn them all and see which 
one is easiest? and how exactly do I store the data to be pushed to the 
page?

I don't have anything stored in any format yet, so I'm looking for a 
solution before I get too far into this mess.

Me, I'd have a hard time keeping a straight face saying that setting 
up an XML system would be "lots" more work than "some sql/perl/php 
configuration."

I would need some more questions answered before giving a considered 
reply:

* Will the data insert/edit/delete interface need to support multiple 
  concurrent users? A 'yes' answer will definitely point to a database 
  solution.

* Do you need easy version control? A 'yes' answer points to XML files 
  in the filesystem.

* Are you well-versed in SQL and client/server stuff? A 'no' answer 
  means the database solution will be hard.

* Do the data need to be type checked at input time (e.g., do you 
  absolutely need to be sure that column 5 contains an integer, not a 
  string?) If so, a RDBMS will do the checking for you.

Other considerations:

* all things considered, data manipulation is easier in an XML file 
  than in a database

* it'd probably take you a lot less time to work up a simple XSLT 
  stylesheet for transforming your XML into HTML than it will to work 
  up an LAMP-ish solution

* if network transparency/availability is an issue, an SQL solution 
  will probably serve you better in the long run

As long as the data are parseable, the initial format isn't too much 
of an issue. You're only a Perl script away from reformatting it as 
XML or a set of SQL INSERT clauses...

Persistent I am, always right I am not. My motivations for saying the
things that I did are deduced from experience, looking closely at the
numbers and trying to remember that operating systems are nothing more
than tools to help us work instead of gods to pray too.

The proper application of Affirmative Action should work well to assist
in ceasing the oppression of a people but I don't believe that it would
apply at all to operating systems or software. The MS bucks are huge
enough that the FTC and Justice Department is willing to look the other
way even with conclusive evidence that they are an illegal, predatory
monopoly. So you see, it's not that I oppose Affirmative Action, I just
oppose the application of Affirmative Action as it relates to
technology. 

Yes, I have a method, my method is to continue to work on deploying real
Linux based solutions as ODOT. This is where I can make a difference
that we will all see in the shortest amount of time. My method has the
blessing of senior ODOT management all the way up. This method has
proved to be successful and is growing in support from within, it would
be great if it enjoyed the same support from the community.

Your correct to assume that I was caught up in the personalization. You
would likely be equally offended if you were in my shoes. The way that I
handled my temper in this instance was immature and unacceptable and I
have since apologized for my outrage and the offense that it may have
caused.

Not at all. I have just as much love for computing platforms as I do my
Hitachi hole shooter, I use the tool for what it's good for and am
usually happy with the results. This stuff is not a living, breathing,
biological entity that is worthy of love, in my opinion, it's just
another tool in my toolbox. Do I want to see OSS fail? Of course not, if
that were true I would be working all day and night on z/OS or MVS
instead of putting together Linux solutions for ODOT business units. Do
I want to see Windows fail? Not at all, I would like to see the
management at MS clean up the way that they do business and make the
conscious decision that greed and ruthless domination is not more
important than quality and integrity.


I sincerely hope that this answers your questions. If for some reason
you would like to continue this conversation please feel free to use my
personal e-mail address as I think PLUG has probably grown weary with
this thread.

This discussion has made me wonder if there are not informal
organizations that help sharing of this sort of knowledge and support
between departments and possibly with vendors.  I'm thinking of
something like a users' group for state and local organizations and
vendors (and for that matter, just technical enthusiasts), not
necessarily oriented towards any particular technology.  It seems that
in a lot of cases, the government IT departments are a good deal more
isolated from groups like PLUG, PASA, etc. than local businesses (with
the possible exception of the educational organizations).  We have the
plug-government list, but what little use it's had has been the public
(mainly Karl, IIRC) conjecturing about helping the city of Portland with
the water  billing problem.  Would there be any interest in something
like this?  Would goverment employees participate in something like
this, especially if it required off-hours participation (such as group
meetings, for example)?

Increased effectiveness and efficiency magnify unwanted effects as much as
expected benefits.  There is a strictly deterministic "cosmic law" (called
cause and effect) that ties massive effort with massive impact.
Consolidated power and wealth means narrower focus of effort and
decision-making.

We are not always right.  We have to stop acting like we are.
We make mistakes.  We have to stop acting like we don't.
We do not know everything.  We have to stop acting like we do.

What makes anybody think they know how to repair an ecosystem?  What makes
anybody think they know how to build a functioning society?  What makes
anybody think they know how to make others' lives better?

There are known and unknown effects of all of our actions and the more
effective and efficient we are at taking action, the more efficiently we
will produce those unknown effects (right along with the known ones).  We
can make plastics fairly efficiently.  That means we are efficiently
producing waste that is not food.  We can efficiently move cars and trucks
on freeways.  That means we are efficiently destroying local economies and
small town (as well as merely regional) culture.

Better to decentralize, break up power, and distribute wealth so that when
something goes wrong, the effects are localized in time and space.  There
is time to learn and space to contain the problem.

You're talking about influencing bigwigs or becoming bigwigs.

So you want to use the coercive force of consolidated state power to
impose your agenda on the public.

That's not a value judgment, by the way.  It's a statement of fact.  The
value judgment comes later when we see the effects.  History makes the
value judgments.

The problem here is that you must play by the rules of the game developed
and refined by entrenched power.

First, you'll have to compete with the profiteers.  Profit-making is
two-fold destructive (at least).  It consolidates wealth by short-changing
labor and/or abusing public resources (the air, water, land, etc.) and it
provides a reserve operating budget unrelated to income with which one can
undermine market competition itself (a single firm operating in multiple
industries or vertical markets of one industry has this same second
effect).

Second, you have to find a way to pretend to be privately operated while
being publicly funded.  This is perhaps the least understood aspect of
industrial capitalism.  It's simply not possible for an organization to
operate at national or international scale without massive state support
in the form of tax exemptions, subsidized loans, state enforced
monopolies, and government contracts.  All of these are methods of using
public resources to prop up private power.  The entire modern American
economy is based on finding new ways to directly convert public funds into
private wealth.  Here is one area were efficiency is exactly what you do
NOT want.  The less efficiently that system operates, the more people can
benefit.

Third, even if you don't compete up-front, you will eventually have to
compete on the back end.  You may attempt to operate in a market currently
untouched by profiteers and operate at a low margin or as a co-op of some
sort.  This is the usual way of side-stepping problem one.  You may also
choose to operate at an appropriate scale that doesn't necessarily require
state subsidy (local or regional).  This set of choices significantly
decreases your ability to impact the greater world.  Operating at low or
no profit marginalizes you socially and means you won't be taken seriously
by the entrenched power and the society that it must indoctrinate to its
values in order to prevent active revolt.  Limiting your scope and scale
obviously limits the number of people with whom you can have direct
contact.  And as soon as you prove that people WANT what you offer (that
is to say, as soon as you create the market), the profiteers will swarm in
and defeat you with their existing structures of power and wealth and
operate more successfully in the industrial capitalist mode since they are
unhindered by your ideals and long-term considerations.

Lastly, your long-term considerations are never long enough or well-enough
considered.  You will find that you are wrong about some things.  If you
had been successful in achieving your original goals, you will also have
been successful in inflicting unintended harm (in addition to whatever
harm you may have intended).  This, of course, is a best-case scenario and
assumes triumph over the first three insurmountable challenges.

I'm not saying that real change is a hopeless cause.  I'm saying that real
change that doesn't also change the nature of our society and economy
(modern industrial state-capitalism) is hopeless, delusional, and
wrong-headed.

The problem throughout history has been that you cannot fight entrenched
power without destroying the base of that power completely BEFORE the
revolt.  However, this means completely undermining and dissolving the
basic ideals and structure of a society which leaves the people extremely
vulnerable to exploitation.  The russian revolution is a great example.
The people fought to get a change that they knew they wanted, but they
didn't have the deep knowledge and education required to build a new
society from scratch.  They needed leaders whom they could trust
implicitly since they were not capable of understanding what needed to
happen to get what they wanted.  So they get Stalin.  Stalin was just a
power-monger who wanted the implicit trust but really shared none of the
ideals of brotherhood and prosperity that the russian people expected of
their leaders.  The american revolution is another great example.
Absolutely nothing was done to modify the base of power and wealth in this
land (sympathetically, "this land", though it's thousands of miles away)
and so the revolution had really no effect in making the people more free
or happy, except for the ruling elite who were already the most free and
most able to pursue happiness.  The ideals of liberte, egalite, fraternite
that fueled the revolutions of the enlightenment period were only part of
the propaganda in the american revolution, whereas they were part of the
ideals of the leaders in the french revolution (and they ended up with
Napoleon, who, like Stalin, just took advantage of a nation in disarray).

The solution is clearly to slowly transition and move people in a new
direction rather than attempt to overthrow the power all at once.  We can
undermine the entrenched power by teaching new ideals and developing a
parallel system that doesn't have the same flaws as the system we hope to
replace (it will have different flaws, surely, but hopefully on a
manageable scale).

Free Software is a great tool because it works against many problematic
aspects of our society simultaneously.

Free Software obviously contradicts current ideas about the so-called
"intellectual property".  I think we all understand that part pretty well.
But another important effect of this is the undermining of the general
concept of property and economics itself.  Economics is the science of
scarcity and software (at least in its distribution and availability) is
not a naturally scarce commodity.  It is abundant.  There are as many
copies of Windows as the world could ever need.  The very fact that we
refer to every instance of a piece of software as a "copy" shows that
there is no original and therefore no economic value in the supply/demand
sense.  The entrenched power is fighting against this realization with all
kinds of methods from generational degradation (SCMS, etc.) to binding the
software to a physical device (key dongles, etc.).  Obviously, these are
crippling technologies tacked on and independent of the actual function of
the software or data.

Since there is and always will be demand for software (and, indeed, all
forms of human expression and invention) not yet devised, Free Software is
able to shift the focus of value from the product to the producer.
People are more important than things (or, in this case, functional
abstract expressions).  Perhaps more fascinating here is the notion of
competition _within a cooperative framework_.  Free Software allows
individual packages to compete for "market share" and individual
programmers and project leaders to compete for prestige and honor while
still, ultimately, operating in a cooperative environment where work can
be freely incorporated from any source to produce the most good for the
most people.  This is really the ideal environment for human beings to
excel.  The notion that cooperation and competition are the same force in
opposite directions (sometimes this appeared to be Rand's thesis) is
absurd and forces a choice that does not have to be made.  We can be
individualists in a collective context.  The forces of competition and
cooperation are orthogonal, but with the strange relationship that when
they are not equally balanced, they tend to destroy one another:  too much
competition and the entire purpose of civilization gets lost, we appear to
value nothing but the law of the jungle; too much collectivism and the
entire purpose of living gets lost, we lose our sense of self.  But when
the forces are in balance, the individual and the civilization can
flourish.

The GPL is called a "copyleft" because it, in the words of Stallman,
"turns copyright against itself."  Most people just think of this in terms
of being freely commercially distributable whereas copyrighted works have,
of late, been burdened with royalties and licensing agreements.  While
this is all true, it really has nothing to do with turning copyright
against itself.  Copyright is a state program which uses coercive power
(fines, jail time, and in some cases corporal or capital punishment) to
enforce the monopoly of a private party against the public.  Copyleft uses
this same state program of coersion to protect the public against any
private party that might try to hide away that which is not theirs to
hide.  Shockingly, a copyleft uses public funds and ostensibly
democraticly supported power to directly benefit the public: a strange
reversal in these strange times.

To be frank, the "information economy" was a joke from the beginning and
as soon as the capitalists realized this, they started to recoil in fear
and revulsion.  Everything associated with the internet and information
ecology is tainted with democratizing force and enlightenment ideals.  If
there weren't so many capitalists in the business of computing, I think
the rest of the business world would be backing out of the whole deal.  I
really doubt IT departments pay for themselves.  It's all just added
complexity and cost without commensurate profit-making value.  We're kind
of lucky they're stuck with it, though.  I believe that the internet (and
the things it allows to grow) is our best hope for subverting the powers
that be.

Let's just hope that we have the fore-knowledge, wisdom, and strength to
keep other methods for consolidating power and wealth from sprouting from
the severed neck of state capitalism.

I know of at least two other ODOT folks that lurk here. Even with this
thread they still remain quiet. In fact, they probably think I'm nuts
for saying what I do in here (I'm the green one of the bunch, I'll
learn). It's no secret that the public opinion of state workers isn't
very high and that works on people after a few years. Considering that
some people will take anything a state employee says out of context and
hand it to the mass media for a nice public roasting, it's no wonder
most of us are quiet and careful (except for me, which probably drives
my boss nuts ( sorry guy :)). As far as participation, I'll join in and
try to drag as many as I can with, I think it's a great idea and I doubt
anyone will mind the after hours stuff.

There are currently 457 people subscribed to the PLUG list.

The last time I checked the Linux in Schools Mailing list, which is
an off-shoot of PLUG, it had ~900 subscribers (the "show subscribers"
function just broke, I don't the exact numbers at this moment: last
figure I have is 898).

The amount of communication between schools is quadrupling per year,
on a local, national, and international level. The communication
between schools and other government agencies is expanding quickly as
well. There is a huge amount of momentum behind the scenes.


BTW, these bits are traveling over ODOT-owned assets. My employer, MESD,
the City of Portland, and just about every other government entity in
Multnomah County formed a partnership a couple of years ago. City of
Portland's relationship with ODOT was leveraged to utilize ODOT fiber
assets to connect MESD to Portland, which in turn connects to Mount
Hood Cable Regulatory Commission funded fiber assets which connects to
the Oregon Public Education Network backbone router at the Pittock Block.

Leveraging open source software is only one aspect of what government
agencies can do to save tax-payer money and provide better serivce.
Trust, communication, and accountability of government agencies is a 
wonderful thing, especially when it can be done from within.

Subject: [PLUG] GTK 2 problem...
Message-ID: <1054348945.14805.8.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I want to take the data from a text entry and shove it into a double.

Here are prototypes for the functions I seem to need under GTK:

     GtkWidget * gtk_entry_new ( void );

     G_CONST_RETURN gchar* gtk_entry_get_text ( GtkEntry * );

Clearly one problem is that a GtkWidget is a different type than
a GtkEntry.  The API documentation is horridly confusing because it
says of the first prototype that it creates a GtkEntry.

Another problem I've run into is not having a signal for when a box
is left via tab or clicking on another one.  The latter is not good
as it's not intuitive to press the Enter key.

The tutorial helps some but does one need to look at GTK's source code
to learn all the signals, etc. or is there a good book for this?
The reference at www.gtk.org is poorly organized :-(

Remember though, those powers have their fingers on the router power

	It might, but I don't know yet. My hunch is no, at least at first, but

I'm sure nobody minds if they are here, they don't seem to be bothering

Thanks. I hadn't considered either of those. I'll look into them, but
MySQL seems to make the most sense, since it seems to be the one
evolving the most rapidly.

First off, thanks for reassuring me on JDBC.

When you talk about Java apps running differently on different OS
platforms, you are (I'm pretty sure) talking about one specific area of
Java that I tend to: the user interface.

In Java, the bits are stored in files in one way. I don't have to worry
about big/little endian and so on. Stuff that really is different (such
as the exact syntax of some SQL strings), can be isolated in a variety
of ways. For instance, resource bundles can hold the stuff that is often
different.

Application performance is definitely relative from platform to
platform, based on a variety of factors. However, there are techniques
that can dramatically improve the startup time of an application. I have
a patent pending (that I share with Mark Hanley) on how to dramatically
speed up the startup performance of an interpreted or intermediate-coded
applications. (Incidentally, I do NOT approve of the philosophy behind
patents and copyrights - it was just a condition of employment at a
former employer). At any rate, since this application is going to
running under Tomcat, most of the overhead involved in instantiating the
JVM is missing.

And this brings us to the final point about *my* preference for Java
over Perl. And that is syntax. I very much like Java's syntax and I very
much dislike Perl's. This point of view is a personal thing, but
something I am very willing to defend. But over beer and not on this
list and not at the risk of starting some sort of flame war.

Language preferences are very personal things. Our choices about what
sort of tools we gravitate towards have more to do with how we approach
problem solving than about any real virtue or limitation of the tools
themselves.

I learned two languages in 1980: Forth and C. There was much about C
that I admired (and still do), but it was a compiled language. There was
this intermediation of the compiler and the performance that made
possible and the immediacy of the interpreter and the expressiveness of
absolute extensibility.

So why did I prefer Forth? It was because I was (and still am) an
assembly language programmer at heart (I've done assembler on over 40
different processor families). When I gave a paper at the Trenton
Computer Faire (the East Coast equivalent to the West Coast Computer
Faire in SFO), I described Forth as: An extensible macro assembler for a
stack oriented pseudomachine.

So it was the fact that I genuinely grock how a processor works that led
me to prefer Forth over C. So much so that I was the Document Editor for
the first three years of the ANSI Forth Technical Committee.

But at the same time, there was this fundamental problem with Forth. My
heresy that Forth was not the ultimate tool for every problem. Even
though we had this wonderful extensibility and Forth is /capable/ of
being used as an object oriented language (I presented my first paper on
Object Oreiented Programming at the Asilomar FORML conference in 1983),
it is all too easy to violate those OO principles and end up biting
yourself in the butt. Forth really doesn't scale very well.

Either late in 1985 or early in 1986, a good friend down in Sun Labs
told me about an interesting new language called Oak and signed me up on
the list for that. I got really excited about that language on reading
its spec and followed the discussion. I wrote a crude benchmark program
from the language spec and within a couple of hours of the first alpha
release of the language, I had it running - perhaps the first running
program on Java outside of Sun Labs (beyond Hello World - there were
several who beat me on that one).

I like Java. It is a truely high level, object oriented language. The
advantages of C++ are so overwhelming, I shudder every time I have to go
back and use what is merely a pre-processor for a 30 year old systems
programming language. C++ is butt ugly, in my opinion.

But that preference for Java over C++ has far more to do with me than
with the virtues of either language. And that aesthetic advantage is
more in my eyes than in any objective analysis (up to a point).

But I was ranting about Perl, not C++ or Forth.

My problem with Perl is actually, my problem with C++, only more so. The
absolute unesthetic code that is produced in Perl drives me mad. The way
there are so *many* different ways to do the same thing and the
undisciplined way of jumping out of the middle of one routine or into
the middle of another just has me pulling my hair out at times.

Mind you, I have written quite a bit of code in Perl. I've done lots of
database stuff and if I have a problem that requires any heavy input
parsing, Perl is the first thing I reach for.

But, just like Forth, Perl doesn't scale. I cannot imagine a project
where 15-20 programmers share a Perl code base. I cannot imagine a
project with a million lines of Perl code.

Not to say they don't exist. Forth has been used in a couple of very
large scale projects, too. But they are most definitely the exception.

But in the final analysis, it is my personality that causes me to prefer
Java to Perl. Just as it is your personality that causes you to prefer Perl.

We can disagree based on our preferences, while still respecting each
other's abilities. The mark of an adult is the ability to disagree
without disparaging the other's choice.

Sorry about the long diatribe, but I just got on a roll.

Peace,
- -Ron

I'm in the middle of configuring my Mandrake 9.1 server, and I have been
having troubles trying to figure out why I haven't been able to access my
virtual servers.

Today I wiped out my Vhost file and started over.. I think I might have
done something right this time because I am now able to access at least
one of the virtuals (the main domain name), but ONLY if I use https://
instead of http://

I know this is because I have an SSL-enabled server port, but I haven't
had this problem with my other server (probably because it isn't SSL
enabled) so I am not familiar with this.  Will there be problems for
people trying to access my virtual servers if they don't type https:// ?

It seems like it should automatically jump to https:// if someone tries to
visit my site with http://

Thanks for any help.

Well, I should hope that EVERY discussion of a philosophical system
includes at least consideration of the alternatives.

However, that doesn't mean I agree that the discussion has been subverted,
that the topic is "radical Left-wing Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt", or that
that is the polar opposite of Objectivism.

Really what I was writing about was anti-fascism, libertarian anarchism,
and social libertarianism.  The polar opposite would be state capitalism,
which, in my opinion, is not what the Objectivists claim is their goal.

If you really believe that what I wrote is the opposite of Objectivism,
then you believe that Objectivism promotes large consolidations of power
(be they state or private power) to crush attempts by individuals and
small groups without wealth and power to establish their own identity and
give shape to their lives and communities.  Really, that's all I wrote
against.

If you would rather than read, comprehend, and discuss, we can do that and
I welcome it. Or you can just continue to label and dismiss without
understanding.

I know plenty of Right-wing environmentalists.  It's all in your
rationale.  But your labelling machine clearly doesn't do any fine
discrimination.  It seems to be all about first blush assessments and
knee-jerk reactions.

I could be way wrong on this, but I'll give you my understanding.

Your web server is listening on the HTTPS port 443.  If the user's client
requests http, it's going to use the standard port 80.

Run `netstat -an` to see if you have anything at all listening on port 80.
(You can also do `netstat -an|grep :80` or `netstat -a|grep www`... it
really depends on how your ports are aliased in your /etc/services file)

I don't know about Mandrake packages or how they're put together (they're
just RPMs, I know, but I don't know about how those things are distributed
these days), but in Debian there's several different apache packages
including a separate apache-ssl package that is set to listen on port 443.
When I want a domain to have https and http, I run TWO apache servers
(apache-ssl and apache-perl, usually) with the same virtual host
configuration and use redirects on the http server for ssl pages and vice
versa (with some caveats that may or may not matter here).

Anyway, get a listener on port 80 to send attempts at your secure pages to
the secure server.

If anyone is curios about the qmail thing I was able to get a quote from
him. I'd rather go with a true spam/virus filter, open up, and merely
block outsiders from sending through me.

I want to be able to run Redhat 6.2 on up, debian, and 98SE.
Linux compatibility is of primary importance.  I'm planning on getting
the processor, 512 meg DDR, case, and a four port KVM switch.  My folks
are picking up the motherboard and an 80 gig IBM hard drive.  Have to
upgrade because my hard drive died and there aren't any drives available
for a K6-III system using VA503+ board anymore.

Try it without -keystroke. Not quite the same but after 5 seconds of using the
keyboard the mouse should disappear.

Thank you

Well, it's very unlikely that I'm going to have to worry about a case.
As far as homework, the answers to the questions I've been posing for
the most part are relevant to just about everyone where even attempting
to answer them isn't likely to cause pain or hardship.  What's the point
of a tech community if it's only interested in legislation that is while
good natured unlikely to help at all with the task of creating better
programmers.  The problem I see isn't a failure to evaluate a broad
field of software choices so much, it's a poor educational environment
for programmers and other high tech service providers.  The problem I
see in the tech sector is job security, I don't have it and I'll bet
that most of the people on this list don't either.  The possibility that
Portland State's CS program isn't accredited is are arguably somewhat to
blame for this mess.  Portland could work on it's poor taxing reputation
also.

When it comes to tough times I share a boat with many on this list where
I'm especially troubled that I need to potentially move away from this
area, something I can't afford just yet making this realization even
harder for me to deal with.

It's sad that I'm trying to offer a disclaimer I've seen so many
complain about.
