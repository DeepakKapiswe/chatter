To me, THIS is the crazy part.

Why would your distribution put binaries linked dynamically in /sbin?
I've always learned that /sbin (and /usr/sbin) is where you put STATICALLY
linked libraries so that you don't ever have this problem.

I now see that Debian does this same dumb thing.  Phew.  When did this
happen?

Whenever I build a system, I keep all the statically compiled binaries
hanging around in /sbin so that I have them in emergencies.  (Like that
time when I deleted /lib... but we don't talk about that around here.)

If you don't have a personalized .vimrc check for a system vimrc which
may be at /usr/share/vim/vim61/macros/vimrc or `locate vimrc` to find it.

The global vimrc can be copied to ~/.vimrc for mangling to your satisfaction.
The installation on my system also has vimrc_example.vim and gvimrc_example.vim.
These have a few more explanatory comments than the vimrc.

We started in our office with a Netgear FVS318 but since it was limited 
to only 8 VPN tunnels so we soon out grew it. Our company's management 
has been pleased with the SnapGear boxes since other appliance 
solutions like SonicWall, or WatchGuard are much more expensive. The 
SME570s supports up to 500 VPN tunnels simultaneously and so in the end 
is very cheap and gives us alot of room to grow.

The Soekris looks great but for some of people it's not going to fly 
since buywe has to put some piences together and install the software. 
The order page makes it clear that if you don't know what you're doing 
and can't get any help with the installing the software don't place an 
order.

If I was consulting for a small business I'd recommend a Netgear FVS318 
myself. It's easy to configure, cheap, and does the job quite nicely.

Most distro's at least put a statically linked shell program on the system so
that you can boot by passing an "init" option to the kernel through grub or
lilo. On RedHat/Fedora it's /bin/ash.static. I've also seen systems with a
statically linked bash, though that can be rather large.

I like the Netgear stuff, too, but its firmware seems to have more
problems than most with specific cards: a Centrino bug was only
recently fixed, and there's packet loss with new Proxim (Hermes II)
cards.

  Only a few weeks ago, when I was seriously distracted, I inadvertently
blew away /usr. Slackware rescue disk saved me then. Don't know why I didn't
think of this myself last evening. Probably too upset with myself.

Ken/Rob,

  Yup. Disk 2 is the live Slackware/rescue disk. Worked like a charm since I
knew which partitions were /usr and /usr/local.

  Removed the wayward libc.so.* and life is once again back on track. I
think. Someone's removed a few spikes, however, and there are deteriorating
ties, so the track is neither stable nor secure. However, the train of live
chugs on, blowing cinders and hot ashes to the rear. Long string of cars
with heavy freight being towed along so it's always an interesting journey.

  In a directory, as root, I tried to execute the following command:
                                    rm .~

Instead of having all backup files deleted, I saw this:

  I'd like to learn what I broke (probably related to the mass movement of
/usr/local from the RH 7.3 system to the Slack 9.1 system) that affects rm.

  Any ideas? I can remove the files if I specify each one fully, but not

Then you want to change the inactivity timeout on the rule that allows 
outgoing connections.  The advantage of changing the firewall is that it 
affects all connections including protocols where it is hard to set an 
application keep alive.

Are we talking about the FVS318 here? The ones we have within the 
company that have found their way to some of our home users is a big 
blue box and has 1 WAN port, and 8 LAN ports so it's an 8 port switch 
as well but it has no WIFI support in it. 

It's the FVM318 that has the WIFI support and supports alot more IPSec 
tunnels compared to the FVS318 (70 LAN, 32 WLAN vs. 8 LAN only). 

Anyone know what Netgear uses for the OS in their VPN firewall 
appliances? I used "nmap" inside our office and it guessed OBSD 3.0.

Can anyone recommend a small distribution of unix to run on a really old
laptop (120 mghz 24 mg of ram 1 gig hard drive).  Thanks!

Great time for another distribution war...

I /hope/ most distributions would still run on such a machine. At a
minimum that is easily more than enough for Debian.

  Hokay -- time for a break. It should be rm .*~, but you're right about
having only half the definition there. Perhaps I should go vegetate in front
of the Stupor Bowl and not try to do computer things for the rest of the
weekend.

  I'm working simultaneously on three machines; two of them have their
keyboards right in front of me and I do find myself typing on one and
looking at the other monitor, wondering why I don't see the characters
appear.

Thanks, Matt,

  Certainly! Those are laden with the MyDoom virii. I've been getting them
for about a week. I also get reports that such virus-laden messages
originated from me. So the attack spoofs sender names and domains
indiscriminately.

  Fun, eh?

Aaron,

  Slackware. 8.1 if not the newer versions. There is a tiny distribution on
the disks.

  This is not to be construed as a distribution war, but as documentation
that you have a variety of choices from among which to chose. So far you
know of Debian and Slackware. I'm sure there will be others.

  Close your eyes and put your finger on the monitor. That'll help you
select the distribution to use.

I've seen real bounce messages from broken mail servers that aren't
rejecting at SMTP-time when a user doesn't exist, along with the virus
bounces...

But that's all easily taken care of:  These unwanted nuisances do not
change their email address.  So just go add blacklist_from lines to
your ~/.spamassasin/user_prefs...example...

blacklist_from	         virusscanner at brokensite.us

This forces spamassassin to mark anything coming from that address as
spam, but doesn't outright slaughter it like having procmail send it
to /dev/null.  Just in case, for some reason, their virus scanner's
return email address has a local-part of postmaster or MAILER-DAEMON,
in case it's actually something you need.

I solved the problem of that happening with my users with exim4 and
clamav.

Debian's pretty handy in that spot...the base install is *tiny*, build
from there.

Besides those already mentioned, have a look at NetBSD.

  I've avoided most of it by putting key phrases in postfix's header_checks

  In Doc Searle's article on DIY-IT in the latest Linux Journal he notes
that while Red Hat and SuSE are reported in the press by their sales
figures, debian is found in many IT shops, too. Because there are no sales
figures for debian it's not reported with the others.

  All in all, who cares what distribution is used? I certainly don't. It
works (until I screw up), it's solid and reliable and the price can't be
beat.

A great starting point is the Linux Weekly News Distributions page:

  http://lwn.net/Distributions/

There are two subcategories on that page that might be of interest to
you: small disk, and older Intel hardware.

I'd also second the suggestion for Debian. You can get a basic
installation pretty small.

Finally, I know that a group had been working on a single-CD
Fedora-based distro, but I can't remember the project name.

I'd be interested in a Fedora Live CD if anyone knows of one.  Someday
I'll get around to building my own Live CD for my own use.

I suspect somewhere, maybe the popularity-contest statistics are
available, which would at least give as an absolute minimum (but
surely a lowball figure, since you have to know about the
popularity-contest package to install it...

For those who don't know what popularity-contest is, you can read more
about it here...

I have looked at this site before.  Its nice to hear all the suggestions
from everyone.  It looks like all that were mentioned should do the job
for me.  You're right I really just need to pick one and give it a go.

And, based on Slackware, there is Vector Linux.  It is designed for smaller 
machines. I've shoehorned it onto a P-133 laptop with 32mb of RAM and been 
able to run a graphical environment.  I think the ISO is about 400MB, but I 
think there's some means of trimming down what packages you get.  I haven't 
played with it a lot, but it it used by FreeGeek for some of the older 
laptops they get too.  FreeGeek might sell preburned CDs of Vector Linux.  I 
haven't checked.

I've had fairly good luck with hardware detection etc. with either Knoppix or 
Morphix.  They won't run a graphical environment with that little RAM, but at 
least you might figure out the hardware.

I once was able to install SuSE 8.0 onto the laptop I mentioned above, but it 
was an exercise in pain and frustration.  It took about a week of trying 
different things and struggling to understand the German comments on the SuSE 
web site :-)

Best,
Kyle

  Saw that, Cooper. There's also the article on OSS in the US at the federal
level in the latest Linux Journal.

  An unrelated factoid in LJ is appropriate here. The background can be read
in the latest issue of The Economist (may be available online, too), in
their 2-page article on Microsoft. While the newspaper likes Microsoft as a
business success, they seem to have the same problems with its monopoly
status as do us reg'lar folks. Reading the articles in The Economist and
Linux Journal allowed me to understand why we read the media reports we do.

  Red Hat and SuSE sell linux distributions and are on most news reporters
radar screen. Slackware does, too, but no one notices; debian is very widely
distributed but has no sales numbers reported. Therefore, the general press
looks at Microsoft numbers, Red Hat numbers and SuSE numbers and reports the
market share of server and desktop installations based on those.

  What cannot be counted is the number of systems that have been converted
from Microsoft to linux (or a *BSD), or created running only the latter,
when there are no publicly reported sales figures. And, no one knows how
many times a single set of purchased cdroms is used on other hardware.

  My conclusion from all this is that all the numbers we read on relative
percentages (Microsoft holding 90% of the server market and 98% of the
desktop market) are way off. I've no idea how much off; probably no one
does.

  Anyway, something about which to think.

There are also a lot of machines running bootlegged copies of Windows, and not all purchased copies of Windows are being used. For example, a Company buys new desktops that come with an OEM version of WinXP, yet the corporate standard is Win2k. In this case two OS's are purchased from Microsoft and only one is used.

Rob,

  No wonder Microsoft reports so much revenue per quarter! Too bad one
cannot be exchanged for the other at no cost but the postage. Slide all the
unused bits into an envelop and send them to Redmond for credit.

Robby's refusing to talk with me AND he's posting *private* email to the

Is apmd running? If so, see if disabling it solves your problem.

/etc/rc.d/init.d/apmd stop
chkconfig --level 23456 apmd off

(I'm sure you know how to do that, I just included the commands for

How is it private email when it was cc'd to other people?   And of 
course, *you* are the reasonable one, not the person who has made every 
change *and then some* that has been requested.   It's this sort of 
thinking that makes me believe you are perhaps a little on the left side 
of the bell curve.

Perhaps PLUG should find a different spokesperson and this argument 
would come to an end as undoubtedly anyone else would see the issue has 
already been resolved.  Now please go back to watching Teletubbies or 
whatever it is you do during recess.

Dear All:


I am preparing to get a new hard drive for my linux box at home.  I
am reading this HOW-TO:

http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO/disk.html

So it seems that if I upgrade to a newer kernel, say 2.6, my box can then 
support
a large hard drive (I am thinking at least 250 GB).

Am I reading it correctly?

Vincent,

  No. The 2.4.x kernels will handle up to _at least_ 200MB, according to the
page. I know that in the past some WD drives were not as high quality as
were other sizes they made. But, other than a new one that's DOA (and going
back to ENU today), I've had excellent experiences with WD drives.

  You're welcome.

  The idea of needing 250G storage -- unless for a large business -- boggles
my little mind. On a whim, I'm adding 80G to the 60G drive in the new box.
But, I'm using (so far) about 16G. Of course, as I develop my fuzzy modeling
software and the models themselves, storage requirements will increase.

You can use a 2.4 kernel also. The thing you have to worry
about is your bios. Does your bios support that size disk?
Also when disks get so large, it gets difficult to back
them up on anything except other disks. One method
is to buy them in pairs and use one for backup. Otherwise
you can lose a lot of data very quickly.

Hi everybody-

Let me know if anyone can help.  I decided to go for deli linux on my
old fujitsu laptap.  I can get the system installed fine.  After I run
through the xfree86 setup, starting the server fails and I get a message


X11TransSocketUNIXConnect: Can't connect: errno = 111

Over and over again until it kills itself.  I am setting it up as root,
so it should'nt be a permissions error. Anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks!

aaron

Message-ID: <20040203055152.GA18381@gate.kl-ic.com>

The real scoop on big drives:

I have been running big drives ( >137GB, LBA48 ) just about since
they first appeared.   The LBA48 interface is relatively new, and
is *NOT* supported by most motherboards (still!) or by the early
2.4 kernels, which did not have drivers for LBA48.  Support showed
up around kernel 2.4.7 (Redhat 7.3 for me) after a lot of work by
Alan Cox around April 2002. 

While most current 2.4 kernels now have LBA48,  your motherboard
likely doesn't (unless it says ATA133 or LBA48), so you will
probably need a PCI drive controller card.  I have been using the
Promise Technologies Ultra133 TX2, which were packaged with big
Maxtor drives for a while.  Note that the drives show up as
hde/f/g/h, rather than hda/b/c/d for motherboard connected drives.

The 2.4.22+ kernels are necessary for IDE hotswap, which is handy
for some things.

As to why someone would need all that disk space - the best reason
is disk-to-disk backups (www.keithl.com/linuxbackup.html), but 
folks that do big CAD tools, video editing, or other "real
computation" will have some enormous datasets.  The folks up at
OHSU doing fetal growth research regularly generate >1TB datasets
(3D fluid flow movies through embryonic mouse hearts, cell-scale
digitization).  When they ship data to their research partners at
Caltech, they fedex whole machines (faster and cheaper than the 'net).

What is the best distro for MythTV? I have tried to run it on Fedora, but could not get the alsa sound stuff working. I am now running it on KnoppMyth. The problem with KnoppMyth is that the MythTV version is now out of date and if I want to upgrade I need to install QT so MythTV will compile. Can anyone recommend the ideal distro for running a MythTV box? Which distro defaults to using alsa sound rather than oss?

Oops, you forgot to wrap your lines.

I would suggest Slackware.  It's very simple to scale Slackware back
greatly (my UML running Postfix, OpenVPN, OpenSSH, Apache, and BIND 9
takes up 68MB of HDD, and it is a bit bloated, I think).

Slackware 9.1 ships with Alsa by default.  For the most part, Slackware
tends to stay fairly current with stable software out there.

If not Slackware, Gentoo might be an easier base to start with.  Yes,
the install is more involved, but once the base system is installed, it
is very easy to build upon.

A co-worker has a student loan through Sallie Mae, but received an
email that seemed suspicious to me.

She was asked to sign in to the following web page, using her social
security number as a password, which first caught my attention:

http://www.salliemae.com

I can see a student load using SSN, but what seemed strange is that the
login screen boldly proclaims "SSL" and shows an image of a locked
padlock. However the URL is http, not https, and the browser's lock
icon is of course unlocked.

I did a "whois salliemae.com" and also a whois on "salliemaenews.com"
which was the address from some other emails she's received and
believed to be legit. The whois shows the same contact info. Browsing
to salliemaenews.com brings up some other page, epigraphx.com.

Any of you security experts have any thoughts on this? If it is a scam,
it looks like a lot of effort was put into it.

Scott,

  Google for "sallie mae". The above domain is the first on the list.

  It's been several years since I paid off my fiancee's student loan so I
don't remember the domain we used to check the status.

  I do know that they use the SSN as identification, though.

I've become completely dependent on pine's ability to fix unbroken or
oddly broken paragraphs. The first paragraph above was reformatted
with a simple Ctrl+J. I'd actually love to move to a GUI client, esp.
one that supports unicode charsets, but I'm really loathe to give up
the ability to produce nice-looking paragraphs quickly.

Eduardo Chappa has a neat patchset that allows Ctrl+J to recognize
even some seriously funky combos of quoting:

This is slightly off topic, but the mail server involved runs Linux,
so we're almost there.

Does anyone here know how direcpc.com's networking works? I've got
a user on directpc account making pop3s connections to her account on
our mail server. Her IP address changes frequently. Is that because the 
home PC is on short, frequently changing DHCP leases? Or is the home PC
on a private IP address and I'm just seeing the IP addresses of random

Scott,

Note that `whois' for salliemae.com also shows...

    Record created on 27-Sep-1995

Most scams are fly-by-night. I think this is legit.

A lot less effort than paying speed freaks to piece together shredded documents
to get SSNs from people.  

Since the NY Times wants $2.95 for an electronic repint of the article I 
suggest you visit  http://www.multcolib.org/  click sequence

  Electronic Resources
  Databases A-Z
  N  
  New York Times (library card number required)

and Search for

The story covers a guy who worked out of Eugene and paid speed freaks to 
piece together shredded tax returns to glean identity information.  They found 
the process interesting...

The link is apparently legitimate (https to manageyourloans.com), but
I suggest never passing an SSN over the Net. Have her call them (using
a public 1-800 number or something) and request that they setup a
password instead.

That link didn't work in Mozilla 1.2.1 under Red Hat 9, it just dropped
me back to the same non-secure page. I tried this in Mozilla 1.5 and IE
on Windows XP, and it did work.

I would think that a big financial company would have logins default to
SSL for SSN's and passwords...

  Careful there, Paul. It all depends on the editor you use with pine. I use
'joe' and the paragraph reformat command is 'ctrl-k j'; ctrl-j deleted from
the cursor to the end of the line.

  Wait'll you eyes get old; the readability of pine in a virtual terminal is
far superior to any GUI MUA I've yet seen. And, since I cannot read CJK or
other non-Roman alphabets in which mail comes to my inbox, simple ASCII does
some of us quite well.

Hi everybody-

Let me know if anyone can help.  I decided to go for deli linux on my

Over and over again until it kills itself.  I am setting it up as root,

One of the misconceptions out there is that the lock must be locked 
before you put your password in.

As long as the two systems negotiate the ssl session prior to the 
sensitive data being sent, then everything is fine.

This can happen after the submit button is pressed.

Just grabbing the index.html with wget shows me that the thing is a big
fat javascript that does lots of odd things that check for browser type
and so on...

Could be that the webserver is dishing out a framed version of your page
(with just one big frame visible to you) and the internal frame is SSL
while the outer frame is not encapsulated?

I worked at a shop that had this problem... they were an online store and
some customers were very concerned that they didn't get the little lock
even though all transactions were secure.  (I don't blame those customers
at all and I'm quite frankly shocked that as many people used the site in
that condition as did.)  They fixed the problem.

But anyway, it could also be that the login is on an insecure page, but
the submit link is to a secure page.  In that case, the SSL negotiation is
done at connection time and the form submission should be secure.  This
seems to be the case on the version of the page served to wget.

See, ^J is just about the handiest thing in the world and when I asked a
few weeks ago about mail processing with vi (since I'm hoping to use
mutt+vi for mail soon), I was specifically hoping somebody could show me
good methods for re-wrapping quoted text... especially with multiple/odd
quoting schemes.

Any takers?

I'll look at this for sure.  I end up re-wrapping by hand at least a
couple of times a week.  Thanks for the link.

I LIKE pine, but I'm still trying to move to mutt for a real GPL MUA,
better gpg interaction, and a more robust customization model.

I use this:

!} perl -MText::Autoformat -e 'autoformat({all => 1});'

It formats, renumbers, indents and can be told how to do or not
to do any of those.

I used to do exactly that. The problem is that I run pine on a number
of machines, and I can't automatically assume that Text::Autoformat is
installed.

I do agree, however, that Text::Autoformat >= Bread::Sliced :-)

Hmm. I thought the old "shift-V ... highlight text block ... gq" routine
did this fairly well. It does for me, at least, but I'm not sure in my
daily usage I've had to deal with any truly weird line-wrapping
situations. I can't say with any real certainty how robust this method
is. It's worth a try, at least. Next time you see a really funky e-mail
message, open it in vim and see if the "gq" trick works for you.

And the machines probably all don't do something nice like automount your
home directory.  That's the one downside of Perl modules.

  Is anyone here using a GUI builder for java that's equivalent to Glade for
GTK+ and uses swing components? If so, I'd appreciate any recommendations
you have.

  As an aside, I find it interesting that so many of the java tools (such as
Eclipse and its plugins) appear to stress Winduhs or be developed under that
OS rather than linux or solaris.

Not directly. I've been doing most config-type work in XML and haven't

Hi folks,

I'm fairly new to Perl and have been working on a small script.  Thus
far I've got it working perfectly but have one question, how do I
remove text from a file?  I am keeping a plain text file with records
that are separated by a '\n\n'.  How would I go about deleting a record?
I tried getting help on #perl in freenode but no one responded so I
thought I'd take it to my favorite LUG.  :-)

Um, context is important here.  You're reading in a file then writing it
out again?  Then you delete it by not writing it.

What kind of records are these?  Have you considered using a SwissArmy
Chainsaw type tool like DBD::CSV (this allows you to treat a flat file
like a database and use SQL against it)?

Details, details.

oh, and `sed /pattern/d file` works pretty well, too.

I am guessing that what you want to do is convert postscript
to HTML. HTML pages can be resized. Postscript files are 
mostly just fit for printing,
For direct postscript to html converters, start here
http://jeff.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/PSto.html

If it is not heavily formatted, you could use ps2ascii,
then just wrap the ascii in the appropriate html.

Just drop it. The issue was acknowledged and we're taking steps to work 
on it. Dan and I have discussed this off list and he's agreed to sell 
PLUG to the evil dictators at PDXLUG for an undisclosed amount. We will 
be going public this Spring and you will all have a chance to purchase 
shares of this fine LUG. Anyone who doesn't purchase a share will 
be...well, we don't need to go there, but consequences will be had.

Message-ID: <40204134.20504@planetargon.com>

February 03, 2004

To All PLUG Employees,

At the end of 2003, we announced several changes to the way we will work 
across our PLUG organization. I am writing today to provide an update on 
our progress and share additional information that will help us deliver 
our growth goals in 2004 and beyond.

Over the past few months, we?ve examined how we can best organize to 
leverage PLUG?s and PDXLUG's relevant capabilities, resources and scale 
in the U.S. to drive growth and effectively address the current market 
reality for our customers and consumers. Based on our discussions to 
date, the following changes will take place in our organization over the 
next several months:

? Effective February 3, 2004, PLUG functions will continue to be part of 
the PLUG Leadership Team located at U.S. Headquarters, which will remain 
in Portland, Oregon.

? David Mandel has elected to retire in March 2004 after 10 years of 
service with the company. Jeme Brelin, VP Sales and Propaganda, will now 
assume responsibility for all PLUG Sales. Jeme will report to me as a 
member of the PLUG Leadership Team.

? Dan Haskel has elected to retire in November 2004 after 9 years of 
service with the company. In the interim, he will report to me, taking 
on a new role that involves providing assistance throughout the 
transition and support for special projects. Russell Senior will 
following along just because he would miss Dan.

? The following changes will also take effect immediately within our 
organization

- PLUG will now be known as 'Portland Little Unit Group'

- Medical Marijuana will be prescribed to all employees during the 
standard work day.

- Employees under the age of 18 are now 18.

- All members will purchase shares of PLUG when I make shares available.

- Servers will be turned over to the respective owner, me.

- Cliff Wells will be in charge of the Flame Dept

In addition, we will be establishing a joint PLUG and PDXLUG working 
team to help us determine how best we can work together to leverage our 
combined capabilities going forward. The team will be led by TacoDog, 
reporting to myself and Cliff Wells. TacoDog will first assemble a team 
of senior leaders representing both PLUG and PDXLUG, and then hold a 
preliminary meeting in late February. The team will be tasked with 
developing recommendations and sharing their findings by July 2004. We 
will provide you with an update once these recommendations have been 
made. In the meantime, if you have any questions, I encourage you to 
reach out to your local PLUG leaders.

As we begin the new year, reigniting growth remains our number one 
priority. I want to thank you for your commitment to our business and 
for remaining focused on achieving our growth goals.

Best regards,

Robby Russell
President
PLUG - 'Portland Little Unit Group'

Well, unfortunately that will not work.  I don't read it in then write
it.  I write to it and then read it in later.  Rather than deleting I
actually need to move the text to a different file.  However, deleting
and moving are basically synonymous from the point of view of the first
file.

It is formatted like so:

  <Timestamp>
  text ....
  text ....
  (there is no set number of lines, it could be from 1 to really big ;-)

  <Timestamp>
  etc, etc


So, what I want to happen is to take a record from file A and move it to
file B.  But have it removed from file A so that the next record is
bumped up to where the record that just got moved used to be.  Possible?

  I have an older edition of ORA's book on XML but I understand that schemas
have taken over from DTDs in many XML languages. I want to use XML for data

  Can folks recommend a current book on XML and schemas as applicable to

Followed by an even better example of the lack of humor of certain

Despite how impressed I was initially with your announcement, I felt

There've been some good reviews of XML books on /., if I remember
correctly.

Regarding schema, I think it'd be good to survey your potential
clients and colleagues to see what consensus they have.

Message-ID: <2762.216.99.218.67.1075875756.squirrel@sautez.com>

Hello all,

I have built a new fedora 1 machine with SW RAID 5 and I'm quite happy
with the install process.  It was a very nice experience.

Now I need to install the src packages for httpd as I need to
recompile suexec to point to a different doc-base.  I would like to
you YUM as I have grown to like it.

How do you tell YUM to go get the src SRPMS?

I added the path to them in the /etc/yum.conf file but it still tells
me that src file doesn't exist when I can actually see it.

Thanks,

Josh

I use emacs for an editor in mutt, I like how mutt preserves line wraps
when possible, but warns you by putting a red plus in column 80 and
continuing on the next line.  It's not word wrap, but at least you
don't have to scroll sideways.

Emacs is handy, meta-Q usually figures out what's going on and rewraps
properly, preserving indents on quotes, even.

Subject: [PLUG] CNN blows it again
Message-ID: <16416.40354.294951.815326@vzavenue.net>

I was browsing cnn.com and saw something in their Technology section
about MyDoom.  Someone basically asked someone from McAfee for
information about the virus.  Although they did mention (in a
roundabout way) that MyDoom is a Windows virus, the last answer from
McAfee basically claimed it was "very difficult" to write secure
software because you'd have to get rid of most capabilities of a PC.

Of course, McAfee doesn't want anyone to know about secure
alternatives, do they?

I sent a letter to CNN pointing out the error.  (In the past, I've
flamed them for their habit of saying "your PC is in danger" from the
latest virus without pointing out that only MS machines are
vulnerable.  I've noticed they've improved; the last time I wrote a
letter, I noticed that the next virus report on CNN explicitly said it
only affected people using Microsoft Windows.)

Absolutely.  But first:

How will the script know which records to move?  Do you want to do this
interactively, or as an unattended process?

To be sure we understand what you're doing I'm offering up this explanation
for you to verify or correct.

  Some process writes to FileA, records are 
    <timestamp><NewLine><DataOfInterest><EmptyLine>

  Later on you'll read FileA, note that there is something in <DataOfInterest>
  that indicates the current record should move to FileB, write that record
  to FileB and remove it from FileA.

If that's true then questions need asking:

  Is there any chance that <DataOfInterest> will contain blank lines and/or
  timestamps?

  What prevents the data from being filtered in the first place and put into
  FileA or FileB as necessary?

  Is FileA being written with new records on a continuous basis?  i.e. are 
  you blocked from putting a lock on it to do an edit in place?

  The Economist explictly noted the virus is limited to Microsoft OSes.

Dear PLUG,

As of 07:30, 4 Feb 2004, posts from Robby Russell and Cliff Wells to the
PLUG mailing list have been administratively blocked.  This action was
taken when, in the judgement of the mailing list administrators, their
behavior crossed the line between advocacy of a particular point of view
and abuse.

Those who wish to object or express an opinion on the propriety of this
action, please direct those comments to the plug-talk mailing list.  The
mailing list administrators will rely heavily on whatever consensus
emerges there.  Please do not post follow-ups to this list.

There's very few places where I'd even consider using DBD::CSV any more,

Here are two single-CD distributions:
Peanut Linux, which is Red Hat/RPM-based
Lorma Linux, which is Fedora/RPM based.

I'm not recommending either of these for a 24-MB system since they are
both "full featured".  Peanut still fits in 1 GB I think.  I use Lorma
Linux 4.0 on my 400 MHz 96MB laptop; it comes with KDE, Mozilla,
OpenOffice.org, Evolution, development tools, etc., which are sure to
push your install past 1 GB.  The install procedure lets you choose
which components you want to install, though.

Subject: [PLUG] Censoring your own CEO?
Message-ID: <4021227D.7000208@tearitalldown.com>

I'd like to formally apologize to all those who are just innocent 
bystanders in this mess. I'd then like to throw up a middle finger to 
those who can't take a joke.

If you consider that "crossing the line" than you kids need to lighten 
up a bit. For a list that allows discussions to go on and on with 
personal attacks, yet ban people for making satire-based posts...well, 
it's just pretty sad.

Jeme, I am glad that you have found a mailing list in which you can 
express yourself and the EVIL, fascists powers that be.. don't censor you.

censored on PLUG (you could be next...),

-Robby Russell

p.s.

if you'd like to discuss anything (aside from the over-discussed name 
issue) feel free to email me.


also... here is my layoff announcement:

  Associates:

This email is to inform you that today approximately 200 PLUG associates
primarily in the Portland chapter were notified that their positions are
being eliminated. Your support and consideration is also requested as we
work together to help these valued associates through this difficult
transition.

The ongoing slump in the economy, the completion of several major
projects and the dip in technology spending has continued to negatively
impact our financial performance. Although we are encouraged
by an upturn in market and proposal activity over the last several
months, there is still excess capacity for the chargeable work being
forecast for the foreseeable future. To remain a competitive and
financially healthy practice, it was necessary to eliminate these PLUG
positions.

At the same time, it is important both to the associates affected and to
the clients they support that there is a period for the effective
transition and completion of project work. As a result, those associates
affected have been given advance notice that their positions are being
eliminated. These notices range from two weeks to 3 months depending on
project completion estimates.

While there will be no list of affected associates distributed, those
associates who have an immediate need to know are being contacted by the
resource management team as part of the transition planning. Many of you
will learn about affected colleagues over the weeks through routine
contact. When you do, please join me in wishing each of the individuals
the very best in their next endeavors and thanking them for their
professionalism, their many contributions and for the transitions they
are supporting.

I don't think so, but it can be made to use 'links' or other text-mode
user-agents.  I know that's not as a nice, but c'est la vie.

Possibly. They're still up in the air as to the topics they'd
like to present.

You can use lynx (and links) to strip out the text 
from the html and display  it with the mutt pager
with the following two changes

in /etc/mutt/Muttrc or ~/.muttrc put 
auto_view text/html

in /etc/mailcap  or ~/.mailcap
text/html; /usr/bin/lynx -dump -force_html '%s'; copiousoutput; description=HTML Text; nametemplate=%s.html

This works fine for me. If you want a more graphical view,
I believe you can also pass the html to a browser for display.
and that would probably be setup similarly with a different
mailcap entry.

Thank you, I'll wait for word from him. If this is untrue I'd be *very*

You seem to be doing an admirable job of leading it, why turn over the
responsibility. Certainly CW writes more flames, but he hasn't done
nearly the job of igniting flame wars; that is what the lead does.


I find your message very insulting. I greatly dislike using killfiles
since key points might once in a while emerge, but you're testing that
stance and I would prefer not to fail.

For those interested, I did find a great solution. I followed the instructions here...
http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/

I'm running it on a Dell 400sc, P4 2.4Ghz, 640M RAM. I'm using a V-Stream capture/tuner/remote card with the bttv driver and an nVidia card with TV out. 

Everything is working great. Now I just need to either run a cat 5 cable from my office (upstairs) to my living room (downstairs), or install and configure a wireless network card.

Wifi isn't fast enough... well, G might be, but B definitely is not.

I suppose it is fast enough if you're just watching a recorded video. 
But skipping through commercials (fast-forwarding in chunks of 10 or 30
seconds) on a video encoded at 800K saturates the connection in my
experience.

Note, I'm not using MythTV, I'm using mencoder and mplayer.  I would
definitely suggest going the CAT5 route if you plan on doing anything
other than plain old controlless streaming.

Subject: [PLUG] rsync
Message-ID: <1075932063.12706.29.camel@apollo.spears.org>

Ok, so  I'm trying to switch to rsync.  I have a server running on a 
machine named apollo.  This is under Fedora so it runs under xinet and I
created a file /etc/rsyncd.conf, which it appears to be reading.
 
I'd like to create (a what, a share , a block) from my home directory,
/home/me.  I cannot do this.  However, I can get things to work with a
couple of subdirectories. So there is something it doesn't like about
/home/me.  AFIK, all uid,gid are of me.  There may be some symbolic
links in lower directories.

rsync apollo::home gives the following on the server:

2004/02/04 13:52:25 [16651] rsync on home from zeus.spears.org
(10.0.1.17)
2004/02/04 13:52:25 [16651] push_dir .: Permission denied (3)
2004/02/04 13:52:25 [16651] rsync error: errors selecting input/output
files, dirs (code 3) at main.c(351)

Anyone, but especially Zot, who  talked me into this.

This is a bit tangental, but the only reason to run rsync in server
mode is to allow for anonymous access. If you or other local users are
the only ones to use rsync, I'd just rely on rsync over ssh.

Actually, My Myth box will be it's own backend server for video. So the network connectivity is only for downloading the program guide, weather info, etc. Also for uploading pictures, mp3s, and small video files via samba share.

I certainly misunderstood that.  I assumed it was like any other client
server situation. If it's local, why do I need ssh. I'll kill the daemon
and see what get.

Sorry. I was a bit cryptic. If you wanted to mirror /home/you that
sits on a remote host to your local host, you might do something like

  rsync -av --dry-run -e ssh remote.host:/home/you /home

By all means, use rsync's -n (--dry-run) switch when first running
rsync. It'll tell you what it wants to do without actually doing it.
Once you're satisfied with rsync's expected behavior, then remove -n
(or --dry-run).

Did you read the manpage?

It's like any other "r" command.  It'll take a remote location for either
source or destination, then open a connection to the remote host via the
transparent remote shell (rsh equivalent) you specify for execution on the
far end.

You can set which rsh to use by either as an argument to the -e option to
rsync itself or by setting the RSYNC_RSH environment variable.

So you might do this:

rsync -e /usr/bin/ssh /path/to/local/file user at remote_host:/path/to/remote/file

And that's the same as this:

RSYNC_RSH="/usr/bin/ssh"
rsync /path/to/local/file user at remote_host:/path/to/remote/file

Dig?

Hi, All:
 
I believe there must be some people had asked this question before, but I can not find it from PLUG Archives.
 
My question is: is it legal to copy or download RedHat Enterprise Linux like we did for Redhat Linux before? 
 
If yes, do anybody know where to download it or anyone can make a copy for me?
 
Thanks a lot!

Actually, It would be nice to get these announcements more then one or two
day(s) before the event. I'm sure you send an announcement as a remind and
that one could easily look on the PLUG web site. I for one could benefit
from a reminder 4 - 5 days before hand. 

Just a suggestion...

Hi, All:
 
I believe there must be some people had asked this question before, but I can not find it from PLUG Archives <https://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/> .
 
My question is: is it legal to copy or download RedHat Enterprise Linux like we did for Redhat Linux before? 
 
If yes, do anybody know where to download it or anyone can make a copy for me?
 
Thanks a lot!

Here's the scoop, accoding to this link:

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/archive/31/2004/01/1/125369

    "According to the RedHat Enterprise Linux ES 3.0 "End User Licesnse
Agreement" - everything within the RedHat disks are freely distributable
except the "RedHat" name and the "ShadowMan" and "RedHat" pictures... In
other words RedHat's branding.

I read the EULA, and the great thing here is the RedHat EULA goes so far
as to tell you which of the few RPM files need to be changed for the
entire thing to be distributable. For this reason, Whitebox is a great
way to get the software, without buying the "name"."

So as long as long as you steer clear of the "non GPL'd" RPM's and the
RedHat trademark, you may download to your heart's delight.

It just so happens that someone has already removed the "non GPL"
components for you. See the link for download details but here's a quick
link:

  http://whiteboxlinux.org/download.html
  

I hope this helps!

You betcha!

Just an observation, but has anybody thought for a moment why we
collectively trust about the only industry in existence that if it
were a person, would be the dumbest blond on the planet, to keep us

A better question would be, "Is there any way to fix messages from
broken HTML MUA's?" in which the easy answer would be, "Yes, have
procmail pipe HTML parts through lynx," but this depends on the sender
having a MUA that isn't so broken as to set the wrong MIME type.

Though about the only people who still has software that can't get it
at least partly right are spammers, so you can decide if not properly
parsing spam is exactly a loss...

If you're not the only person that uses that system, it may be better
to use ~/.muttrc.  Generally, it's safer to only change your local
version of the configs:  You can always go back to a known working
configuration just by deleting yours.

I protected an admin directory with .htaccess.
worked fine.  but.....
Now I want the admin directory login to run over SSL so the
admin password does not go on the wire in cleartext.  This server
seems to accept https connections and seems to have a certificate
installed.  I did not set it up, so, no guarantees that all OK.


According to what I
read you use SSLRequireSSL to force it to use SSL.
So I put SSLRequireSSL into the
.htaccess file. Now... If you try to go in as http://<whatever>/admin it 
gives a server config error.   If you take that out, it requires a login 
as before, but it's an insecure login.

Here's the really bad part:  if you  go straight in as 
https://<whatever>/admin
with or without SSLRequireSSL in .htaccess
it drops you right into that very sensitive directory -- no password
required --  defeating the entire exercise.
I tried  <IfModule !>  with redirects and it chokes.
I read that's  legal in .htaccess but acts like its not...
It's like the port 80 server doesn't like any of the secure stuff
and the secure server ignores the .htaccess file regardless.

This is identity theft waiting to happen.  How can
I fix it, short of taking the site down.
How can I test to see that SSL really is set up completely
correctly on this server.

yum doesn't support downloading sources.  Adding the source directory to 
the yum.conf won't do any good because the list of source packages is 
stored in a different place.  yum currently doesn't make any use of the 
list of source packages.  I know people are working on adding the feature.

Subject: [PLUG] Crimes and Justice against SCO and Microsoft
Message-ID: <20040205045809.GA11112@gate.kl-ic.com>

I'm going to hang it out here, and possibly incite a flame war.
This may be a really stupid thing to do, and get me banned from 
the list.  I hope not;  what *intend* to do is to prove that we
are civilized, responsible adults.  So cross your fingers ...

In the latest EEtimes, the article "'Electronic terror' in Linux's
shadow" ( http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20040202S0032 ) reacts to
the MyDoom virus, as well as the threats against SCO's Darl McBride
and the folks that have spoken out in support of the SCO position. 
The article point out that many people that hold the Linux community
as a whole responsible for MyDoom, even though the person or persons
responsible are a very tiny subset and unrepresentative subset of the
whole community.  The article then goes on to discuss the death threats
against McBride and various journalists and analysts that offer any
shred of support for the SCO position.  The article says that the
Linux community consists of about 80% practical-but-not-political
users of Linux, 10% evangelists, and 10% nut cases. 

Most of us in PLUG probably shade towards evangelist, but there is
a risk of falling into the nut case category.  What I want to do
here is to draw a line between evangelist and nut case.  For the
following list, I will refer to "SCO and Microsoft" as "S&M" for
short.  Here's some places to draw the line (oversimplified, it
is a multidimensional space):

0) I love S&M.  You Linux people are silly.

1) Don't offend anybody.  Say nothing about S&M.  Just smile and
help people run Linux.

2) Participate in efforts to expose S&M faults, and support IBM
and others in the lawsuit, but otherwise promote caution and
avoid suggesting any kind of reactive measure.

3) Participate in active legal attacks on S&M.  Make rude remarks
about the companies, their principals, and their customers.

4) Engage in victimless but illegal attacks on S&M, such things as
posting secret sources to the net or hacks of license code.  Here
"victimless" is in the sense of causing annoyance or thwarting 
expectations, but not in terms of leaving systems useless or 
people physically hurt.

5) Make threats of physical damage;  destroying data, breaking
machines.

6) Make threats of personal damage against DMcB or BG.  

7) Actually launch physical/network attacks - i.e. MyDoom .

8) Actually launch personal attacks - i.e. break legs, pistol whip.

9) Kill anti-Linux principals.

Obviously, different ratios of network/spoken/physical threat can be
imagined, but the above scale works as a starting point.  

I imagine we have amongst us folks with opinions ranging from (1)
to (6).  I don't think we have any (0) or (7-9) folks.  

Myself, I am comfortable with (1) through (3), and waver between
(2) and (3) in my own behavior - that is, every legal activity,
in good or bad taste.

If I encountered (0) or (4), I would admonish.  If I encountered (5)
and (6), threats of physical or personal damage, I would counter
with threats of exposure.  If I encountered (7) through (9), actual
illegal attacks, I would call the cops and help with investigations. 
If I saw somebody trying to kill Bill Gates, I would use lethal
force to prevent it if necessary (then call in a BIG favor).

All that said, I have been known to mouth off to levels as high as
(6) myself, sometimes.  Jokingly making threats.   MyDoom has made
this a "not funny any more".  Times have changed.  I am smart
enough to think up different jokes.  

The MyDoom virus is the first time that someone who claims
membership in our tribe has used that as an excuse to perform
widespread vandalism, level (7) on the above scale.  For many
people among the vast majority that is NOT our tribe, that is
their first concious impression of Linux.

That is a *lousy* way to get people's attention, IMHO.   A half
dozen of those, and we are not just ignored but actively suppressed.
I think that on act may have cost us a few months of progress. 

But opinions likely differ.  Maybe attention of any kind is good.
Maybe the rightness of our cause justifies any act.  However, if
that is the majority opinion, I'm outta here.  

I'm wondering where the rest of you stand.  Indifference?
Quiet? Active? Illegal? Damage? Murder?  What would you do,
and what would you tolerate, and what would you punish ?

What do YOU think?  We will get some silly/joking answers to this
question - please help me keep this thread on track by ignoring
those.  The folks making the jokes are worried too.  Let's get
some opinions out there, and avoid the flames while we learn the
feelings of the group.  Perhaps some of the debate can occur at
the Lucky Lab on thursday.

Keith

And forgive the long rant - this is a tricky subject, and definition
may help avoid some misunderstandings.

Where did you get the idea that actual physical threats were made in the
whole MyDoom debacle?

I think that any self respecting person (be they of Linux or M$ roots)
would not make such threats -- threats are criminal in nature.

I just wonder where you think that threats were made?

Interesting post, but I've seen enough flame wars for the short-

Bingo!  Somehow I just got it in my head that there had to be a server
client.  So when I read the man page that's what I hit on. 
Additionally, I was avoiding ssh because I had formed the impression
that it was complicated to set up.  Boy, is my face red (oh wait, that's
from drinking).  Getting ssh going was maybe the easiest thing I've ever
done in linux.  So now everything works and I can see why everyone kept
saying, "Use the ssh, Bill, use the ssh."

Thanks all

Hee hee, this is helpdesk nirvana:

bill> I'm stuck with rsync.

plug> Why not use it over ssh?

bill> Eh?

plug> You know ... ssh.

[Here follows a longish pause in the conversation.]

The customer does all the work, and still says thanks to the helpdesk.
Why would anyone ever want to send this sort of job overseas? :-)

The problem is that the manpages all have a gazillion options on them,
when all you really need to do is:

        ssh-keygen -t rsa
        [hit return a few times until the prompt is back]
        ssh you at other.box.com
        [enter your password for otherbox when prompted]

Trivial.

  Because they don't know what questions to ask. Ergo, there are more calls
and more profit is made.

This brings up a question I've had for awhile.  I use a not
insignificant passphrase for my ssh identity.  Does this matter?
Am I wasting keystrokes?

It certainly would save me time when I start work at 4am and have to
retype my passphrase 7 times because my brain isn't working, yet.

Be that as it may, that isn't a widely-held opinion.  Today's NYT, for
example, weighs in on the stress caused by unwary, clue-deprived users.

http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/05/technology/05VIRU.html


While the F/OSS community *could* do more to improve its public image, I
don't think we are responsible for virus writers any more than we are
responsible for crimes committed by other members of our ethnic group.

Besides which... it's quite possible that there's more going on here
than meets the eye. If you were trying to install backdoors at a
specific target without letting them know they were under attack,
wouldn't this type of attack fit the bill perfectly?  

Cloaking specific attacks as a general nuisance would be a great way to
divert resources *away* from the real problem (the open back doors) and
toward incidentals (the flood of bogus mail).  Perhaps that port gets
closed and everyone's AV software is updated by noon, but how much time
do you need if you're scanning for *specific* computers to hack?

If the significant amount of forensics brought to bear on this case
don't turn up some misguided teenager or malcontent, I'd begin to
suspect that this attack may have served a purpose that isn't
immediately obvious.

FWIW,

Dylan

Yes, you're wasting keystrokes. :-) The long answer is that you could
save yourself time in the long run by

1. wrapping your X or terminal session in ssh-agent
2. load your key into memory using ssh-add

This assumes, of course, that you've already pushed your public key to
~/.ssh/authorized_keys on any remote machines you log into.

A simple demo is available in any xterm:

  you at localhost$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
  Agent pid XXXX
  you at localhost$ ssh-add
  Enter passphrase for /home/you/.ssh/id_rsa:
  you at localhost$ ssh remote.host
  you at remotehost$ # hey no passphrase required! :-)
  you at remotehost$ exit
  you at localhost$ ssh-add -D
  All identities removed.
  you at localhost$ eval $(ssh-agent -k)
  echo Agent pid XXXX killed;

Sorry, I was ambiguous.  I already use ssh-agent, ssh-add, and have
my id scattered about on the net.  The specific question is:  What
security do I gain by having a passphrase over an empty passphrase?
I have to enter that passphrase whenever I do an "ssh-add".  I'd
prefer not to have to enter it.  But, I don't want to store my 
passphrase on disk (say in a script file).  And I worry that having
an empty passphrase would compromise my machine's identity.

(The only reason this is an issue is: 1) I have a behemoth machine
that makes too much noise for me to run all day; so, I only fire it up
for compute-intensive jobs -- these slow fans suck.... I pine for the
old 400Hz hardware I used to work with, and 2) our power goes out
alot.)

An empty passphrase means that should anyone gain access to your
private key, the intruder would be able to become you on remote
machines without further assistance. A passphrase raises the bar
considerably.

  Depends. I have a long sentence as a passphrase. When I'm moving stuff
between machines here in the office (behind the firewall) all I need type is
my password on the remote machine. However, when I'm away from the office I
don't mind typing the entire passphrase to let me -- and no one else --
through the firewall to the network.

I use no pass-phrase on my laptop.  It's all a matter of who you trust
to have access to that file.  My laptop is precious to me... so I
treat the whole thing as physical security issues.

But I have a passphrase on keys that are on shared machines.

the difference between
having an unprotected private key file
and running an ssh-agent all the time
is not that great if I have access to your running computer.

but it makes a big difference
if I can get your files without your running computer,
like if I steal a backup tape
or steal your hardware.

those are just the risks I can think of offhand.
there may be more.

> What is the best distro for MythTV? 

I ran into the same problem with KnoppMyth, no easy way to update it.
Which is a shame, as it is running a modified version of Debian.

To date I've had at least 5 working installations of MythTV in the
last 6 months, and only the last two were satisfactory for stability
and quality. Jump to the bottom for the summary.

The first version was on a Celeron 400 with a Hauppage WinTV BT878,
an older card that was supported correctly, using Mandrake 9.1-MythTV
.12., and an ancient PCI ATI Mach64 card with tv out. As a proof of
concept, it worked, but quality was really low due to the CPU. I
think I tried RedHat 8 or 9 on this machine at the same time, but the
install from source of MythTV did not go well. Using urpmi in
Mandrake to get all the dependent programs was much easier.

Rev 2 was a reinstall using the same hardware, with the exception of
bumping the processor up to a P2-733. Surprisingly, the results
weren't much better than the Celeron 400.

Rev 3 was a moved over to an Athlon 1200. Results were good enough I
installed a second PCI capture card. There was 'almost' enough CPU
for simultaneous double captures now, the second card had problems
tuning in the audio on some channels (an Avermedia Stereo, I think).
I used this setup for a few months, but it was never completely
stable, and the Mythbackend recording app would randomly lockup or
quit several times a week. This platform also experienced a slight
whine in the sound during playback, which never really went away
until I junked the athlon 1200/motherboard combo.

Rev 4 bumped up to an Athlon 1900+ and KnoppMyth R4, with dual hard
drives in a software raid 0. The Avermedia card was dumped in favor
of a second Hauppauge card, a model 401. It took a while to figure
out that lilo did not like my mixed hard drives, change over to GRUB,
and figure out how to get KnoppMyth to configure and automount my
raid array. This combination worked fairly well, but strangely, the
CPU was taxed even more than the Athlon 1200/Mandrake 9.1 combo was.
Stability was so so, but I struggled with it for a few months until
Myth .13 came out and I attempted to upgrade and couldn't find an
easy way to do it.

Rev 5 (My current setup). I installed Mandrake 9.2 with all the
updates, then installed Myth from the contrib RPMS. Everything worked
extremely well and the system is now completely stable for the last
month. The remarkable part is that CPU utilization dropped to half or
less than what it was with KnoppMyth, and quality of the playback is
VHS or better at 352x288 @ 800 MB per hour. I then installed a cheap
Nvidia 5200 series card with tv out, and the TV display quality
jumped up noticeably over the ancient ATI Mach64 card. As a side
effect, I can now play Doom using PRBoom in OpenGL mode on my TV, and
it looks great! I've tried several other OpenGL games, and they all
seem to work okay.

The only real issue I have right now is that for some reason, the
sound mixer refuses to save the correct settings after a reboot,
which I noticed when I installed the new video card. I haven't looked
too closely at this yet, as it's not a big problem.

To summarize, Mandrake 9.2 and Myth R .13 from rpms is, in my
experience, quite a bit faster and is actually stable, as opposed to
the alternatives I have tried, and is easier to install than
KnoppMyth, at least on my hardware. I went through a lot of capture
and sound card combinations to find a combination that worked, but
I'm happy with the results.

Longer passphases make it harder to crack your private key, if it were to be compromised. It is really a matter of security vs. convenience and how you prioritize them.

Are you using the Alsa sound modules?  If so that is the default behavior.
See: 
  http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=FAQ021

stated reason is "If the mixer was left in an undefined state there
could be unexpected feedback problems, or worse, damage to your speakers
and eardrums."

I had the same problem. I have added a line in a startup script that runs "alsactl restore" to automatically restore my mixer settings on boot. You might try that.

Thanks for the info. I suspected that Mandrake might be a good choice. It is good to have that confirmed. If I run into issues with the Fedora/ATrpms solution I will give that a try.

Subject: [PLUG] Best distro for MythTV? My experiences with Myth
In-Reply-To: <20040205194715.24948.qmail@web14427.mail.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <00e801c3ec28$7099cb00$6401a8c0@LAPTOP>

I have only tried myth (011, 0.12) on mandrake (9.1) with a cheap
avermedia  card, onboard sound, an athlon 1.3ghz, 256megs ram and a
single, dedicated 120gig 7200rpm drive and have had pretty good success.

My only real issues were in finding/installing some of the dependencies
for mythmusic and mythdvd. Actually, it was a real pita to get some of
it working. For example some lame issue of requiring fast fourier
transforms with double, not single bit precision, but all the rpms only
had single, yet finding the proper source version to compile with double
wasn't working (aaak) anyhoo...

Given that the cpu doesn't do mpeg2 compression, the cpu has to take the
load, and at 1.3ghz, it's about at its limit. That is, I can't be doing
much else with the box lest I want to see some slight but annoying
stuttering. There may be room for optimization, but I haven't had the
time to investigate. 

While the overall quality of the shows (including color quality) is
fine, given that the tuner card was only $70 or so, I shouldn't expect
much. Moving to the pvr-250 or 350 should make a noticeable difference.

Actually, does anyone have any experience with improved quality from one
card to another (all other things being equal)? -- If so, I'd love to
hear.

This card would also free up cpu for other things, so it's a double
bonus.

I do like mythweather and mythmusic, though I don't use them much these
days, for some reason.

I finally have mythdvd working with a decent xine command line to load
in IR blaster commands to control the dvd playback in zine with the same
remote. It's a simple thing, I know, but it makes for a wonderfully
seemless experience. 

I reall like mythweb and I should upgrade because I hear it gets better.

I really wish there was an easy way to use the cutlist to cut
commercials and archive shows without going through the pains of
reencoding. Oh please...ohh please...

I'd also really like to see a mythradio for recording, well...radio. Npr
especially.

I haven't tried .13 -- Oohhh 0.14 is out!

Thus ends my experience.  

Ps. I'd LOVE see a plug-talk on mythtv. I probably wouldn't be the best
for giving it, but I'd be happy to share info. 

Cheers,
sasha

A plug talk would be okay, but perhaps a MythTV install fest at the
upcoming Riverdale High School linux install lab in a couple of weeks
would be better? This is the kind of project where a couple of dozen
eyes would really help. 

My wish list includes getting a working DVD burner export script so I
can start archiving the stuff I really like...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0402051305580.12536-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I tried looking in the archives but even on a 1.5Mbit connection it is
slow with all the mydoom caused problems.  So I'll just ask for for the
Cliff Notes version or the month/year for any discussion on problems with
CUPS and a RHL 7.3+ upgrade to Fedora Core 1.  One of the last things I
expected was this and unfortunately the system isn't available to me until
this week end.

When I try to configure a printer configuration (as root) I get an error
about not being able to create or write to the queue.  And I've already
forgotten what the error message was exactly and didn't write it down ...
:-(damn.)

I looked in the directory(s) where CUPS claimed it wanted to work - 
/var/spool/ and /var/spool/lp0 - and saw no permissions problems.


TIA,
Rod

You are defintely welcome to do an install fest at the Clinic. Bear in
mind, however, that our volunteers are probably not MythTV gurus.

The Clinic will be held on February 21st.

Gaah!

Help.  Please.

I'm building a Debian Unstable desktop machine for somebody and I'm having
some strange behavior.

First, I noticed right away that 2.6 contains no /proc/pci.  What's the
best way to get this information in the new-styleee?

Second, my mouse doesn't work.  I installed the ps/2 mouse kernel module
and it comes up and even tells me what kind of mouse I have, so that makes
me think that the port and mouse are somewhat working.  But gpm dies
instantly and X says "no core pointer" and dies.

There's a message in syslog every time gpm tries to start that claims
"/dev/psaux: no such device".

WTF?!?

More info:

Here's some relevant dmesg output:
input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse on isa0060/serio1


So I tried both /dev/input/mouse0 and /dev/input/mice.  Same problems.

Gah, gah, gah, and wtf, too.

Hello,

I want to move some users to another user account.  So, if they had a
user name of:

josh

and I want to change it to

josh.orchard

Is there a way I can still alias the josh account so that the user
would have time to log in with both accounts to get email and ftp?

Or is that something you can't do because if I create another user
account it will have a different ID number and file permissons would
be hosed.

Thanks for the help,

Josh

Thanks Ian.  The sad thing is I download the src package and still I

Well, you /can/, but it might be more trouble than it's worth.  I've
done this with LDAP--posixAccount can have a multi-valued userid
attribute, which maps to the username.

I think that there might be an option in the kernel configuration file to put
/proc/pci in the kernel.

See drivers/pci/Kconfig, which says in part:

config PCI_LEGACY_PROC
        bool "Legacy /proc/pci interface"
        depends on PCI
        ---help---
          This feature enables a procfs file -- /proc/pci -- that provides a 
          summary of PCI devices in the system. 

          This feature has been deprecated as of v2.5.53, in favor of
          using the tool lspci(8). This feature may be removed at a
          future date.

          lspci can provide the same data, as well as much more. lspci
          is a part the pci-utils package, which should be installed
          by your distribution.  See Documentation/Changes for
          information on where to get the latest version.

          When in doubt, say N.

Evidently, Debian's 2.6 kernel turns this off.

Actually, I think that "no such device" means that the device number doesn't
exist:

amunk at gloingo:~$ sudo cat /dev/hda
cat: /dev/hda: No such device
amunk at gloingo:~$ ls -alt /dev/hda
brw-rw----    1 root     disk       3,   0 Mar 14  2002 /dev/hda

Right... that's more like it.

crw-------    1 root     root      10,   1 Mar 14  2002 /dev/psaux


Anyway, I'm not even sure that's where the kernel wants to put my mouse.

What's this bit I quoted earlier:

input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse on isa0060/serio1

Seems like the input device abstraction has gone a bit further... should
my mouse be in /dev/input?  But it's not /dev/input/mouse0...

The goal is to have the virtual domains to have the same user login
sub part so that I can use VirtualMin and allow the Admin of the
virtual domains to control their domain.  This requires that the OS
users to have a user name of:

josh.mydomain.com

It sounds like Will pretty much explained to me that I would need LDAP
setup doing all my account info.  Which I think in the end I will have
MySQL with VirtualMin doing some but it only uses MySQL for other
settings not users.  That is still down at the normal user level and
hence the OS name standard.

Thanks.  I guess I'll just move the users over per domain with some
arrangement.  It isn't that many just was trying to find an easy no
hassle move option.

I believe your problem doesn't lie in that /proc/pci doesn't exist, you might 
have to enable Devfs, even though it's depreciated. I believe that I remember 
having to do so. Another alternative would be to try to figure out a way of 
doing it with udev, but I know nothing about udev.

You *can* do this.  ("Do you *want* to?" is an entirely different question.)

The simplest way (for a few accounts) is to directly edit the /etc/passwd
and /etc/shadow files.  (You might want to: (a) make sure the originals are
safe, (b) no other admin is working on user accounts, and (c) no end-users
are trying to change their password while doing this work.)  If you've got
a bunch (more than 20-30), you may want to use a small script to help.

Find your entries from /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow, e.g.

   [root]#  grep ^josh /etc/passwd /etc/shadow
   /etc/passwd:josh:x:3023:3450:Josh Orchard:/home/josh:/bin/bash
   /etc/shadow:josh:$1$KruZ55qS$uxyzpNM2abcd1234b788k1:11655:0:99999:7:::

Now, contruct new lines for each file with the new username

    /etc/passwd
    -----------
  [existing]    josh:x:3023:3450:Josh Orchard:/home/josh:/bin/bash
  [new]         josh.orchard:x:3023:3450:Josh Orchard:/home/josh:/bin/bash

    /etc/shadow
    -----------
  [existing]    josh:$1$KruZ55qS$uxyzpNM2abcd1234b788k1:11655:0:99999:7:::
  [new]         
josh.orchard:$1$KruZ55qS$uxyzpNM2abcd1234b788k1:11655:0:99999:7:::

Save the files, and now both usernames have exactly the same UID, GID, home
directories, password, etc.

Now one problem you might want to think about ... what happens when "josh"
or "josh.orchard" uses the passwd(1) command to update their password?  I'm
pretty sure only one account will be changed, but not the other.

Don,

  Why wouldn't one use pwunconv to remove the shadow password file first?
Then, after dinking around with the password file, run pwconv to regenerate
the shadow file from the one, changed one?

  Heh-heh-heh! Most of the "stories" I see in the junk that gets through are
cut-and-paste jobs from apparently random Web pages. Google already has such
a literature collection. :-)

  What I find works almost 100% is finding the key word or phrase that's
common to the same class of junk mail. As variants come through I either
modify the original filter or create an additional one. It's working well
enough for me ... at least, for now.

Viruses create a whole new class of headaches for admins who want to
honor all the SMTP RFCs *and* keep their systems free of viruses.

In an ideal world, an inbound virus would be detected during the SMTP
transfer phase, and the message would be rejected with a 500-class
error message. (The same ideal would hold true for spam, as well.) In
the case of viruses with their own SMTP agents, like MyDoom and SoBig,
the virus would never be delivered and no one would ever receive a
bounce notice.

Sadly, most viruses are detected after the message has already been
accepted by the MTA (Sendmail, Postfix, etc.). That leaves the admin
on the receiving machine three bad options:

1. Notify the user that a virus has been detected in an inbound
   message and give user the chance to look at it, if need be.

   The thing is that most users don't want such notices; they're a
   nuisance, esp. during a virus storm like the recent MyDoom episode.

2. Notify the sender that the message was undeliverable.

   This is the cause of the spurious notices you (and all the rest of
   us) have received in the mail. It's a useless policy when viruses
   spoof the sending address.

3. Silently drop the infected message.

   A nice idea, except that it violates every RFC concerning the SMTP
   transactions.

Here at work, we're most of the way to the 'ideal world' scenario
listed above, but it's a complex infrastructure to maintain and not
likely to be implemented in most domains for some time, if ever.

Subject: [PLUG] Short talks for plug meeting
Message-ID: <20040206191831.GA26775@gate.kl-ic.com>

At the Thursday general PLUG meeting, Dave mentioned that he was
short on speakers for the next few months.  Perhaps, we can fill 
the gap with a few evenings of multiple short talks rather than
single long ones.  For example, I have a number of short talks I
could give, strung out over a few months:

   1)  Using swap trays with Dirvish/Rsync backup
   2)  Cosmetic customization of KNOPPIX
   3)  Integrated circuit design tools for Linux
   4)  The  "Intellectual Property" metaphor
   5)  ... many more 

These are not long talks, and I couldn't do them back to back (too
much preparation).  But 1/3 or 1/4 of a full presentation would
be easy, and if I was boring I could be easily hooked off the stage.

Most of us have a lot of little talks in us.  If we put together all
our "little tricks" we could probably fill 20 meetings with them.
A useful fill-in when we don't have something bigger to talk about.
To save wear and tear on Dave, he could assign "guest hosts" for
these nights, responsible for coordinating the sub-presentations.

We could also do some lightning talks - 5 minute rants.  Not open
mike, some preparation and practice should be required, but not
big slide and demo extravaganzas, either.  These would be good 
fillins while projectors are prepared and files located.

Lastly, a "metapresentation" night would involve everyone bringing
their laptop and trying to pass a few slides through the PSU projector.
This would be helpful clearing the way for future presentations. 
Those without laptops could try putting a few slides on a CD or
floppy or USB drive and trying them on someone else's laptop. 
I can imagine most people would be out in the Smith lobby in small
groups fiddling with X config files and such, or tweaking on
presentation software.

Paul,

  Thank you for the thoughtful and complete exposition. I suppose that I
should have mentioned in my original message that it was 'amvisd' (did I get
that name correct?) that detected the viral message. So I assume that the
virus checker is set to respond to the sender's name (in your case 2) and
not run 'whois' to find who actually sent it.

  Is the latter what you are doing?

Thanks,

Rich

See http://www.amavis.org/. We don't use it now, but I've used it in
the past.

Yes.

Let me add that running whois isn't really an option. It'd violate the
RFCs, produce even more worthless, spurious e-mail messages that are
completely unwanted by their recipients, and, when you get right down
to it, not solve anything.

The only real standards-based solution is to reject the message during
the SMTP transaction. Once the message has been accepted, you're left
with the three bad options I outlined in my previous message.

The sendmail folks have provided the 'milter' hooks so admins can
have other software (e.g., spamassassin or virus checkers) examine a
message *before* it's been accepted for delivery. Some interesting
software is out there that takes advantage of libmilter:

* http://www.roaringpenguin.com/mimedefang/
* http://www.snert.com/Software/milter-spamc/

I don't know if other MTAs have similar capabilities.

It's amavisd, or more proper, AMaViSd.  :-)

It is easy to configure amavis to silently drop viruses and spams...
which is, unfortunately, what I have been forced to do.  Postmaster
still gets them in his mailbox (I capture all outbound port 25 traffic
and send it through AMaViS, so if an internal machine becomes infected,
I want to know about it).

>   Is the latter what you are doing?

If I read his email right, no that is not what he is doing.  When you're
rejecting messages, you either reject it while it is being transmitted
to your server, telling the sending server "hey, I'm not gonna take this
email, so you are in charge of notifying the sender about that."... or
you reject it after having already accepted it... you say "ok, I'll take
the message.  Have a nice day" and then you scan it and find out you
don't want to actually put it in your user's mailbox, so how is the
sender to know his message wasn't delivered?  Your mail server is in
charge of the message now, so it is its responsibility to notify the
sender of the message their message didn't go through.

The problem with virus and spam scanning is it is difficult to identify
the virus or the spam before accepting it for delivery.  So your server
is supposed to, according to the RFCs, notify the sender (designated in
the email itself) that their message is not going to be delivered.  The
problem with this is the sender is virtually always spoofed.

Paul's method doesn't accept the message, decide not to deliver it, look
up the owner of the IP, and email them... Paul's method manages to scan
the emails BEFORE saying it will accept them for delivery.  This way,
the burden of notification lies on the sending server (and in the case
of viruses with their own smtp engines, no bounce email is ever
generated).

I'd be interested to hear exactly how Paul manages this... if I
understand things properly, this is what Sendmail w/ Milter is able to
do?  Tie that in with AMaViSd-new and you'd no longer have to worry
about generating bounce messages.

  There was a pertinent, and interesting, thread on this topic earlier this
week on the mailhelp list. Chuck Mead proposed rejecting all
Microsoft-executable attachments. If folks need to distribute legitimate
binaries, he proposed, rename the extension to someling like .dat or .zip
and let the recipient know in the body of the message.

  Looks to me like a reasonable solution in light of the volume of virii
going around. I do block all of those here because we don't run any software
from Microsoft, but I realize not every organization is so far-sighted. :-)

Unless the server is set up to use a sound card, it *shouldn't* be
requesting any resources that the UML kernel doesn't have.  The key is
that the sum of the changes UML makes to the mainline kernel are limited
to memory management and the virtual device drivers.  The only class of
programs that have trouble with UML at this point are projects like NPTL
(New Posix Thread Library) that interact at an extremely low level with
the processor, kernel, and glibc.  Every other app runs blissfully
unaware.

If you get one of our servers and find that it doesn't work, we'll do
what we can to try to make it work, or refund the service.

[moderators: this message is also waiting in the queue, kill it]

With some of the most "perfect" timing I've ever seen, Nagios and MySQL
conspired last night to fill our webserver's disk with nearly 1.7GB of
logs, consisting of Nagios saying "Wheee! balin is up and pings in X
ms." and "Wheee! dwalin is up and pings in Y ms."  Logs were coming at a
rate of maybe 100 *per second*.

After shooting Nagios in the head, everything settled down.  Now we're
going to figure out what possessed MySQL to log every single query in
excruciating detail, and slap that down.

So.... if you couldn't get to our website over the last 16 hours, this
would be why.  None of our other machines, services, or customers were
affected, just our ability to *get* new customers <sigh>.

That's exactly right. Scanning for viruses and spam happens during the
SMTP transaction. If the milter app doesn't like the inbound message,
sendmail rejects the message before it was accepted for delivery.
Then, as you said, "the burden of notification lies on the sending
server."

Subject: [PLUG] UML image merging?
Message-ID: <867jyzc04x.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I have a question about COW and backing files.  When I initially setup
the UML hosts I used in the December AT talk, the four hosts I had
were running off the same backing file.  The question I asked last
night was about mounting the COW file in order to loopback mount it in
the host system (e.g. to copy in modules for a new kernel).  When I
wanted to do this, I had to merge the COW with its backing file to
create a new backing file for each virtual host.  After that, I wasn't
sharing the backing file anymore.  The PDXcolo people seemed to imply
that it was possible to re-merge the separate backing files into a
single backing file and, presumably, per-host COW files.

How do you do that?

You have to boot the UML kernel with the original backing+CoW file,
along with the either original or new flat or backing+CoW, and do an
rsync between them.  The easiest way to perform this is by booting via
hostfs, as per the HOWTO:

http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/UserModeLinux-HOWTO-9.html#ss9.3

The trick to safely doing that is to pass init=/bin/bash to the UML
kernel, so you don't have the UML kernel trying to start up services
that are already running on the host, using the exact same files (since
UML root then == host root).  From there you can mount the two ubd's
(ubd1 and ubd2, not ubd0 as that "is" hostfs) and rsync between them as
needed.

Also keep in mind that you have to do this in order to flatten a recent
CoW file, because the stock Debian (and others I presume) uml-utilities
do not have uml_moo support for version 3 CoW files.  I haven't checked
the latest release myself.  And since the uml-utilities do not have a
way of going *back* to a CoW file (since rsyncing is a filesystem-level
thing, not block-level), you'll probably just want to write up a script
that will work both ways and use it in all cases anyway.

Also, remember the phrase "Once a backing file, Always a backing file". 
Specifically, because the CoW file is a *block*-level difference and not
filesystem-level, any changes of any kind to the backing file will
totally invalidate the CoW file, and UML will refuse to use it.  When
moving backing files around disk or net, make sure you preserve the
mtime, or UML will freak out.  However, that is the *only* check it
performs, so you can play with disaster scenarios e.g. scribbled disk
that way.

Rich,

I think I understand these commands.  If I run pwunconv it will remove
the need for a /etc/shadow file and combine them back together.  Then
I can edit just one file /etc/passwd as Don suggest.  Then run pwconv
and the /etc/shadow will be created again.

This would minimize the impact to users and they would not see the
change.  Allowing them to continue and then change over to the new
accounts and then I could remove the user entries at a later time.

Am I correct?

Thanks,

Josh

Josh,

  Yup:

PWCONV(8)                                               PWCONV(8)

NAME
       pwconv, pwunconv, grpconv, grpunconv - convert to and from
       shadow passwords and groups.

SYNOPSIS
       pwconv
       pwunconv
       grpconv
       grpunconv

DESCRIPTION
       These four programs all operate on the normal  and  shadow
       password   and   group   files:  /etc/passwd,  /etc/group,
       /etc/shadow, and /etc/gshadow.

       pwconv creates shadow from passwd and an optionally exist-
       ing  shadow.   pwunconv  creates  passwd  from  passwd and
       shadow and then removes shadow.  grpconv  creates  gshadow
       from  group and an optionally existing gshadow.  grpunconv
       creates group from group  and  gshadow  and  then  removes
       gshadow.

> This would minimize the impact to users and they would not see the change.

  Would they see the loss of the shadow password file? No.

> Allowing them to continue and then change over to the new accounts and
> then I could remove the user entries at a later time.
> Am I correct?

  I'm not sure what you propose. If you change their username they should
notice as soon as they try to log in again.

I would think that the context-switch latency caused by UML would not be

Well, Let's say I send an email to everyone telling them of their new
user names.  some people don't check email very often or on vacation
or something like that.  Then when they try to get their email it
won't work and they will be come frustrated.  If I have both running
for a while then it will be seemless and can allow for the change to
happen over time and make the transition a nice experience.

I doubt it in SKAS mode.  However, I am starting lmbench runs on both
the bare hardware and in a UML to see what the difference is.  This
won't be a repeatable test because both benchmarks are running on
production machines, but will give an idea of the ratio.

Context-switch latency is usually in the 1000-2500 cycle range IIRC, or
around 1-2 microseconds on our hardware.  Even if the context-switches
were 100 times worse, the latency will still be several orders of
magnitude below basic network latency.

I'll publish a summary of the lmbench results here whenever they
complete.

Josh,

  Well, you've exceeded my knowledge of how the real world works. Someone

I  typed your question into google:

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=linux+%22what+is+listening+on+that+port%22&btnG=Google+Search

and came up with the following:

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/archive/14/2002/08/2/27661

Which tells us that the  ' netstat --inet -latp' command will do this.

I tried it on my server, and it seems to work.

Broken mail servers will do that.  Fortunately, you don't see it much:
Such sites are unable to receive mail from most domains since often
mail servers don't have the same DNS and rDNS.  My site is an example
of that, so is the Beaverton School District, Stream International
(when I worked there), Nike...you get the idea.  Doing so makes your
email universe very, very small.

*A* right answer, perhaps.. but to label the use of one MTA, one virus
scanner, and one configuration "the right answer" seems very...
monopolistic.  ;-)

I'd be interested to hear if anybody has a way to convince Postfix to
reject viruses and/or spams at SMTP-time rather than always accepting
the nasties.

  That makes two of us desiring to read the answer. The spam is handled
pretty well by header_checks and body_checks, but I'm always looking to
block the new ones not yet in there.

Message-ID: <21945-77124@sneakemail.com>

I just started playing around with LVM on Linux.  I've used LVM on HP-UX
for years, so I was pleased to see this nice feature of HP-UX make it into
linux.

However, the familiar way of mirroring logical volumes ("lvextend -m 1")
seems to be missing.  A quick Googling for "Linux LVM mirroring" showed me
this link:

http://lists.sistina.com/pipermail/linux-lvm/1999-November/004273.html

That post is from 1999 explaining that mirroring was planned for the
future.  Well, it's the future now-- did this get added?  ;-)

Is the MD driver the only way to do software mirroring on Linux?

I don't follow the Postfix list closely anymore, but I last heard there
was experimental support in the snapshots for using the content_filter
mechanism at SMTP-time. You have to be careful with that though; some
SMTP servers have rather low time-outs, so you'd have to only use
reasonably fast checks.

That's how my fix does it.  I wish the so-called professionals would
get their heads out of their asses:  I don't have any professional
experience running mail servers, but if I could do it, certainly they
could.  And if you're insulted by this, GOOD.  You should be, I'm
speaking directly to you.

And if you're going to go this route, you should set your software up
so it does not ever send virus warnings to anybody outside your
domain, and only in response to virus instances from inside.  At least
then, if the bounce isn't going to the right person, odds are you can
at least find the right person.

Well, so do viruses.  When it comes to RFC compliance with SMTP, what
with all the spam and viruses, I say go eye for an eye and beat them
at their own stupid server tricks on your own server.

This only starts a race condition: If this gets widely adopted, then
all that will happen is the viruses change filenames.  Whee!

It's not just a matter of changing names; most scanners already use
file(1) identification rather than rely on extensions.  Even so, there
are already viruses that pack themselves in archives, which is why most
scanners will also scan the contents of archives.  The only reasonable
way to pass that kind of data is by using an archive with a
password--PKZIP has had one for years, but it wasn't very good crypto,
so it never got widely used (or maybe not one bothered to care).

I'm not saying you can't adapt it, I'm saying that exim and clamd are
pretty easy to set up and configure and odds are if you're running a
mail server, you can see what I'm doing and adapt it to what you're
comfortable with.

That being said, if you get the same results with different software,
please email me so I can add it.

Heheh, good luck.  Everybody on debian-user that's seen my answer has
just switched to exim rather than goof around with other MTAs.

I'll check in to that when I get the time... and the time keeps getting
shorter.  :-)

How long ago, do you recall, that this was in the snapshots?

Also, how long is 'rather low' as far as time-outs go?  I regularly have
checks exceed three seconds, sometimes they get as high as four or five
seconds... very rarely higher than that.  SA is the killer there; I
suppose I could filter for viruses (really fast/cheap in CPU cycles) in
one pass, during the SMTP session, then filter everything that survives
that through SA.  I do get more viruses than spams.

What happens if the sending server times me out, I wonder?  Would it
just attempt to connect again, silently drop, or what?

Thanks  :-)

I suspect both, to be honest.  PKZIP was more popular in the 1990s
before most of the Great Unwashed had even thought that computers
could be a security risk, and those with a clue realized how trivial
zip passwords are.

It's still there; you can read about it in the 'SMTPD_PROXY_README'.

I would actually use SA checks, but only local ones (and maybe tuned
only for the fastest checks) and skip the virus-checks; while virus
checks are generally pretty fast, it's posible that they can take much
longer.  amavisd-new only checks messages <64k for spam by default
(tunable), so as long as remote checks are disabled, there's a ceiling
on how long it can take.

Generally the server will disconnect and retry later; that's the way
SMTP is supposed to work to be reliable.

I was hoping it had made it into the mainline release... guess not.

It looks very interesting, and quite useful.

Here's how I'm envisioning my setup with this SMTPD_PROXY...

Backup MX box - figure out how to run it all through SpamAssassin, local
checks only.  The box is limited in the RAM department.

Main mail server - two amavisd-new's running.  The main one stays as it
is.  It does full virus scanning, local and remote spam checking.  The
second one becomes the proxy one - it'll run only local spam checks and,
if I can swing it, virus checks.  I'd like to configure the virus checks
to time out at 500ms and *not* error if they time out.  I'm not sure if
such a facility exists for that yet... might need to hack things up a
bit.

That would, of course, be a bit redundant.  Local spam checks would be
run twice.  The first half second of any virus scans would be run
twice.  It would be nice to configure it such that the virus scans would
only be run once if they completed successfully on the first run, but
I'm relatively confident that would require more hacking than I want to
toss into this right now.

However redundant it may be, I feel it would be more effective; most of
the spam and viruses would be caught at the front door, so to speak... I
wouldn't be responsible for the bounce messages (or lack thereof)
reducing the risk of false positives going unreported.  Things that made
it through to the second tier... I would still be left with the initial
issue - to bounce or not to bounce?  ...but it would be far less
important, as the big popular viruses out there today could be blocked
with local SA rules if the virus scanner takes too long.

Nice.

Now, to implement such a thing might be more of a pain in the ass than
thinking it up.  :-)

Anybody see any obvious problems with that idea?  FWIW, the mail server
is terribly underloaded.  :-)

Thanks for planting the seed and directing me towards the
SMTPD_PROXY_README, Wil!

This is from drivers/input/Kconfig:
-/\/-
config INPUT_MOUSEDEV
        tristate "Mouse interface" if EMBEDDED
        default y
        depends on INPUT
        ---help---
          Say Y here if you want your mouse to be accessible as char devices
          13:32+ - /dev/input/mouseX and 13:63 - /dev/input/mice as an
          emulated IntelliMouse Explorer PS/2 mouse. That way, all user space
          programs (includung SVGAlib, GPM and X) will be able to use your
          mouse.

          If unsure, say Y.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
          module will be called mousedev.

config INPUT_MOUSEDEV_PSAUX
        bool "Provide legacy /dev/psaux device" if EMBEDDED
        default y
        depends on INPUT_MOUSEDEV
-\/\-
Maybe mousedev was built as a module and it didn't get loaded?

That was exactly the case and I resolved it earlier today.

You would definitely /want/ the local spam checks to be run twice--it
might not make the score high enough with the local checks alone, but
local and remote checks later might.

I don't bounce for spam or viruses; there isn't much point.

Not too bad really--you'll just need separate config files and separate
temp dirs.  One downside is that you'll also need separate Bayes
databases, so Bayes will be pretty much useless on the front-end proxy
(it seems very unlikely to me that you'll pass the score thresholds
without remote checks enabled; it might be useful if you can some how
find a way a feed messages back into it).

That's about how I'd proceed.

Yes... it would be nice if there were some method of passing the already
completed local checks score to the second scan, which would just add on
the remote scores to it.  Of course, that would be far more work with
the existing tools out there...

Viruses, I agree... and I don't bounce for them.  Spam, however... I had
an RBL returning everything true for about a week before I figured out
what was up (well... took the time to figure it out)... if people hadn't
emailed me saying their messages to me were getting dropped, I would
probably have never checked.  Unfortunately, false positives do happen
due to things like that sometimes.  :-(

I hadn't thought about the bayes database... I wonder if I could run
both layers of the same database?  Since SA is just reading the
database, locking/sharing stuff shouldn't be an issue.  If both
instances of amavis were running as the same user, they'd share the same
bayes database.  The local_sa_checks setting is in amavis's config file,
so should be set in the spamd intialization......

This might take some experimentation, but I'll bet we can get the bayes
database shared between the two check levels.  Otherwise, we could just
duplicate it between the two users.

> Let me know how it works out.

Will do... although I'm not sure when I'll get around to attempting an
implementation.

Yep. Although, now that I think about it ...



:-)



In further detail: An abortive attempt at a LVM 1.1 was made with
disastrous results (some bad design and bad decisions among other
issues) before it was decided to halt all LVM1 development in lieu of
LVM2. Linux 2.6 features only LVM2. However, LVM2 is very new, so it
doesn't even have all the features of LVM1 -- it just has a better
"foundation".

That said, I'm an LVM "expert", not EVMS (from IBM), and they may have
logical mirroring. In fact, they probably do. Though I'd expect it's
closer to AIX LVM tool-wise. I, too, come from HP-UX in this regard,
so I related better with the Sistina tools. BSD's tools mirror Veritas
more, if I understand correctly.

A darker response than the other fine answers is:

Run nessus from another box.  Nessus will tell you what service is running 
on the port, rather than what a program will identify itself as.

The surprise of finding out that ssh is running on port 113 is not as great 
as the wrench in the stomach of figuring out you've been hacked.  Conversly,
having nessus confirm that everything is what it seems to be is very 
reassuring.

I'd really like to use ssh-agent and ssh-add, but I regularly have to
ssh through a couple of machines to get places, and nothing I've done
has enabled ssh-agent to let me do that without typing my passphrase at
each step. Any ideas, anyone?

Set "ForwardAgent Yes" in your .ssh/config at each stage of your
journey.

Message-ID: <1076140977.18721.67.camel@lana>

I don't know if this is just me or what, but I have had a ton of bounced
emails returned to me although I did not send them.  I run a mail server
on my home network and my other user is getting them too.

The thing is, as best I can tell, the headers show my domain but not the
right IP.  I am certainly no expert but I am surprised that someone can
forge the domain and the IP is not checked.

How can I prevent the bounced mails from coming back to me, or am I just
caught in someone's evil plot to destroy bandwidth or sell male
genitalia enlargers?

It those helpful sysadmins who automatically send bounce messages for
virus generated e-mails. I get more bounce messages than spam some days.

Since you're not sending the e-mail, the only way I can imagine not to
see them is to sort the bounce messages out and toss them.

It's not just you.  The latest thing for spammers and viruses seems to be
to include From: addresses that appear either in the list of spam targets
or in the case of viruses, the infected computer's address book.

I've been hit pretty hard too.  I had no idea I was on so many people's
address lists!  ;-)

The latter.

Man, what took you so long to respond :)

I could easily sort out the bounced messages but then how do NOT sort
out the legit ones?  That really is not the important question though. 
Why isn't the IP checked and the domain taken for granted?  I am
surprised by that.

Doing so would make your universe very small:  If you reject email
because DNS and rDNS don't match, you eliminate all but maybe
something like 5% of all mail servers out there.

  Welcome to the wonderful world of the MyDoom Microsoft virus. I've been
getting a ton of messages that are supposedly 'bounced' back to me although
I never sent them. That was the subject of my message about anti-virus
checkers responding to the username.domain rather than confirming the IP
address.

  You can't prevent them from traveling the 'Net but you can set your MTA to
filter them out before they get in the door.

  There are certain words and phrases common to the undesired, phoney
'bounces' that do not appear in a legitimate message. You can filter by the
header (generally the Subject: line) or body content. I do both.

You're not alone.  http://spf.pobox.com/ is an example of a solution being

I run Debian unstable and somehow, I've messed up my startx. I prefer to login

can't do that, startx gets a generic xterm and that's all. To get Kde, I have

Any suggestions on how to get startx working again? Thanks!

While your complaint is consistent with MyDoom, as has already been
pointed out, it's also possiple that you have become the victim of a
"Joe Job"--where spam is sent with your domain in the From:, so all
bounces go to you.

  If I read the Web pages correctly, this SPF is designed for ISPs,
particularly large ISPs. I suspect that there would be no benefit accruing
to me with our two users here on our domain. Is this correct?

It sounds like 'startx' is working okay to start the server, but it's
not starting your session.  Does the xterm that comes up have an ugly
green or pink decoration around it?  If so, it's probably starting 'twm'
for some reason.  Check the ~/.xinitrc file and ~/.Xclients*.  If none
of these have the 'startkde' command, then one needs to, but if there's
anything that looks like another window manager, you'll need to remove
it.

Your .xinitrc file should look something like this.

#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/startkde

The "Debian" way of doing this is to use update-alternatives. Look in
you /etc/alternatives and 'man update-alternatives' for more
information.

When this latest avalanche was first starting, I'd look at the To: field
and wonder "Now who do I know who knows this person?".  I'm thinking that
if someone figured out a way to track this virus, we could get a pretty 
good map of social connectivity.

Subject: [PLUG] ISA bus and network card
Message-ID: <1076183091.7915.8.camel@timmy>

I just got my hands on an old machine with an ISA NIC and modem. I don't
care about the modem, but I really would like the NIC to work.

It appears to me that neither of my install mediums (gentoo basic livecd
or debian boot-floppies) include support for the ISA bus. However, I
don't know for sure. lspci says there's an ISA bridge, but doesn't show
any information about anything on the bridge. The card itself does light
up when I stick a cable in it, so it would appear that the hardware
isn't a problem.

How can I (1) determine if my kernel supports ISA, (2) make it support
ISA, and (3) get my NIC to work?

Thanks,
Evan

That's not generally possible. If it happens to be PnP (and not many
network cards that I know of were), you can use isapnptools and the
pnpdump program to figure more out, but all PCI will tell you is that
there is a bridge, not what's behind it.

It's highly doubtful they left out ISA. Extremely doubtful. To get
your NIC to work, you need to figure out what chipset it uses. Look
for distinguishing features and/or chips on the card and ask us or
Google.

Rich,

Very funny.  I just had one conversation with one customer and he has
no problem. Just wants to arrange a time.

The real world is a strange place but I do try to pay attention.

Thanks for the help.

  My good ol' Kensington Orbit trackball is acting balky. I've castrated it
and checked for impacted threads and the usual culprits that cause it to
drag and jump instead of smoothly tracking across the screen. Nothing there
that I haven't cleaned out. I just put some alcohol on the two rollers in
case they had warn smooth.

  Could these devices just plumb wear out? I've had this guy for at least
5.5 years and it's really nice to use. But, trying to do fine movements when
creating illustrations in tgif is an exercise in frustration because of the
jumpy movements.

Any thoughts?

It would not hurt to add the SPF TXT record to your DNS even though
your SMTP server didn't support SPF. Other mail servers that do
support SPF would be able to determine whether e-mail messages with
your e-mail address were, in fact, from you. If the messages were spam,
they would know to block the servers sending the spam instead of
putting your e-mail address in their black lists.

It seems unlikely that it would degrade as you describe.  I would expect
a hard failure.  Are you certain that you cleaned _everything_?  I suppose
the LEDs in the opto circuitry could be getting weak, but I think dust
is a much more likely culprit.  Is the trackball the old slotted wheel
type, or does it have LEDs aimed at a speckled ball?  If the former,
make certain that you have gotten all of the dust out of the optos.  If
it's a speckled ball, you probably got it as clean as it can get.  It
may really be dying.

Yes, but at some point Postfix will be spending so much time
checking header and body content that Postfix will start
misbehaving. I already reached that point. I had to either
use a faster computer or stop doing as much header checking.
Given that there didn't seem to be an end to the creative ways
that spammers were coming up with Subject lines, I cut back on
header checking.

I will bet that it uses those little rollers and I'll bet the little
itty bitty bearings in those really little rollers have just about given
up the ghost. Of course, if it really is optical, then its something
else again.

I had a similar situation with my beloved Kensington Expert Trackball after
six years of trouble free usage.
What I've noticed, that the resistance across its LEDs had increased, due to 
physical depletion in the p-n-p structures. Thus they emit less light needed 
for IR receiver to operate reliably. 
I've replaced both current limiting resistors on these LED with the smaller 
ones and my trackball operates as good as new.

Just my 0.02 c

Thanks for confirming that not seeing it in lspci is normal. I pulled it
out, found the name and model number, did some googling, type modprobe

Well that's one approach.  Personally, I just turn off the notification.

galen,

  Yes, it was a transient failure. Swabbing the rubber tires on the two
wheels (there are pseudo saphires for bearings, no LEDs as far as I know)
and running the Q-tip(R) around the inside of the container seems to have
done the job. At least after letting the alcohol evaporate over night.

  It's a smooth, plastic ball and two thin rods (one along the right side
the other along the "bottom" side) which turn as the ball is rotated. I use
a magnifying headset and spinter foreceps to clean out the threads and other
cruft that occasionally wraps around the rods and prevents them from moving.
This time they were whistle clean.

  That's when I washed the ball and wrote to ask if these things do wear
out.

  Then it occurred to me that the rubber on the wheels might be worn smooth
and slipping on the ball. Washed the ball with soap and water and used the
alcohol to roughen the wheels. Of course, I was also trying to get some work
done at the time so I didn't see results right away.

  When I first had to use a pointy device for mapping software, about 10-11
years ago, I soon came down with tendinitis from the mouse. After getting
that cured with acupuncture I have used a trackball ever since and can't see
using anything else. Of course, no such device beats the keyboard, but there
are needs for such devices so I like to use the one that's easiest on my
body.

Many thanks,

Rich

Paul,

  Take note of all the old Okidata 19x series dot-matrix printers still
working in retail stores after 20+ years. :-)

Ed,

  When I finish the transition to the new box and finish installing tinyDNS
I'll add the SPF txt record.

Understood. Most of the minor problems I'm running into are from not
having an adequate understanding of, for instance, how the sound
mixer system works so I can change the default settings to stick
after a reboot. It's just 10 or so little things like this I would
appreciate help on, and perhaps give help on similiar issues I've
encountered. 

Anyway, I'm hoping we can drum up at least a few more people
interested in recording TV with their linux boxes to come to the
clinic, and not necessarily with the MythTV project. There are a few
related projects out there now that are starting to mature.

Any takers?

Sean Harbour

My guess is that the two thin rods are mechanically coupled to a slotted
wheel.  The slotted wheel turns inside an opto interrupter.  This is
how ball movement gets turned into electrical signals.  If dust were to
make its way into the wheel or opto, it could cause problems such as you
described.  It sounds like you found the problem though.

galen,

  This certainly looks reasonable. I've never delved into the guts of the
trackball; I gave up taking things apart just to see how they work when I
was about 8 years old. Guess that's why I didn't become an engineer. :-)

Many thanks,

Rich

If I were in your shoes, I'd still considering getting a new one. :-)
Some of the newer Kensington's are amazing -- a bazillion buttons,
wireless, USB, what-have-you.

On the other side, my Logitech trackball was optical before Microsoft
brought it to the mouse. All I have to do is clean off the teflon
support posts from time to time.

Yes, including electro-mechanical devices.  I have an original Microsoft
Mouse from about 1990 that cost (my employer) nearly $100 then.  But it
had acquired the bad habit of emitting spurious clicks.  I just replaced
it with a generic PS/2 mouse labeled "Made in China", $5 at Fred Meyers.

Rich, you might find that a new optical trackball is rather inexpensive,
compared to your time and hassle for diagnosing and repairing the Orbit.

Robert Munro

Gee and I thought my 3 button Logitech mouse from circa 1997 was a 
fossil. Nice to see other people holding on to still working "antique" 
hardware. :-) My Logitech mouse had some small rollers that the ball 
would run and they finally wore out after 6 1/2 years of near constant 
use and the pointer movement wasn't very good anymore.

I was at Office Depot a few months ago and picked up a new, "plain 
white", Logitech optical mouse with the scroll wheel for my Linux 
workstation. All I can say is I wish I had gotten an optical mouse 
sooner as it's so much smoother than the old ball mouse I had. I also 
feel a but dumb not getting a mouse with a scroll wheel sooner as well. 
All those extra miles of dragging a mouse across the desk to scroll 
through windows and I could have had my finger doing all of the walking 
instead.

I admit to hating the first optical mouse I ever had to use which were 
those odd ones that Sun had on their workstations. They only worked on 
that reflective pad and it really turned me off of optical mice in 
general back in those days. I recall always asking my employer for a 
mouse with a ball when they were giving me a Sun workstation to use.

I just installed Fedora1 on a laptop and everything seemed to work

ifconfig revealed that eth0's broadcast and netmask addresses were

When I started main menu::system services::network, it threw up a little

I can make it work with ifconfig and route so there's no hardware

The configuration files for eth0 are in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

If you use a RedHat utility to configure the eth0, you may find some
cruft in /etc/sysconfig/networking.  Not yet familiar with Fedora, just
RedHat stuff.

To clarify, from the vim help guide (:help :noh)
:noh[lsearch]           Stop the highlighting for the 'hlsearch' option.  It
                        is automatically turned back on when using a search
                        command, or setting the 'hlsearch' option.
                        This command doesn't work in an autocommand, because
                        the highlighting state is saved and restored when
                        executing autocommands |autocmd-searchpat|.

So if you want to get rid of the current search, use /sjsjsjsj or :noh

This is more useful than editing vimrc IMHO since if you switch systems,
this still works, whereas .vimrc will require fore-action.

BTW the # cause the links due to:

#                       Same as "*", but search backward.  The pound sign
                        (character 163) also works.  If the "#" key works as
                        backspace, try using "stty erase <BS>" before starting
                        Vim (<BS> is CTRL-H or a real backspace).  {not in Vi}

and forto solve the reference to *

*                       Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
                        word nearest to the cursor.  The word used for the
                        search is the first of:
                                1. the keyword under the cursor |'iskeyword'|
                                2. the first keyword after the cursor, in the
                                   current line
                                3. the non-blank word under the cursor
                                4. the first non-blank word after the cursor,
                                   in the current line
                        Only whole keywords are searched for, like with the
                        command "/\<keyword\>".  (exclusive)  {not in Vi}
                        'ignorecase' is used, 'smartcase' is not.


This is a feature I have not used.  I might.  Though with VI in a term
windows, it is easy to double click the pointer, hit :, middle bottun,
enter......

I've heard of WD-40 also doing a good job of softening up the rubber and
getting the glaze off (wipe of the excess of course).  It will also
clean water out of the inside of automobile spark distributors.  Don't

Dexxa 3 button serial mouse. I got it June 1990 for my 286
at a "trades for grades" thingy a local computer store was
doing (you know, when computer stores were still small).

Switched it out only a couple days ago on a server here
because I got an optical and the "mouse replacement
hierarchy" knocked it to the extra computer stuff box.

Can anyone beat me? Just curious.

Though there's one use on the label of WD-40 that you shouldn't use it
on:  Bicycles.  WD-40 will make any moving bicycle part wear out and
sieze up in zero flat.

And that's because WD-40 evaporates.

It's a very short term lubricant.

Otherwise, it would not work well to dry out ignition systems.

Dunno it's exact vintage, but I have a IBM-AT keyboard from
approximately then. Still using it on my *main* workstation. ;-)
Wonderful mechanical key mechanism and built like a tank. Removable
connector cable so I could change to PS/2 connector. Removable keycaps
for cleaning. It's all that. I wish people would make keyboards that
well anymore. Sites I've found claiming such sell very nice IBM
keyboards indeed, but still not quite the same.

... Troublesome pointy devices ...

I don't use a trackball, but I imagine the issues are similar to a
mouse, with the added bonus that garbage falls in, not out.  An 
occasional open/invert/shake-out-the-cookie-crumbs should be added
to the below procedures.

I have lost only one mouse to a bad switch.  I have temporarily lost
*many* mice to crud on the sensor rollers.  This takes about a minute
to clean.  A mouse with mileage on it will feel like it is moving over
gravel, and will be a bit jerky.  When you open the mouse up, there
will appear to be a little felt pad 2 mm wide on the sensor rollers
where the ball contacts them.  This is not manufacturer's original
equipment;  it is debris from your skin and clothing.  The felt comes
off easily;  there is usually a thin layer of knobby black gunk stuck
to the sensor roller underneath.  Patient scraping with a pocket knife,
or your fingernail if you are not fastidious, will remove this.  

There may also be some crud on the diagonal wheel.  Clean this too,
it does not enhance your mousing experience.

My obsessive-compulsive ritual at public libraries is to remove the
crud before using the mouse.  Sometimes librarians ask what I am 
doing, but most of them are trained by now.

Tektronix has a surplus store, open to the public, in the basement
of building 38 on thursdays from 2 to 5.  They usually have a bin
full of used mice, $1 each IIRC.

I'm using one of these as well.  I love it.

I make a point of buying every one I see.  Usually at the Goodwill for
$3.99.

I think I have two left.

A year or so ago, I actually came across a "regular sized" IBM keyboard
with the same Selectric feel.  It's PS/2 with an integrated cable.  It
feels very much like my keyboard, but has the footprint, thickness, and
weight of a lesser keyboard.  Is this what is being sold today?

  You can probably get bins full of dead mice from OHSU, too.

  I just replaced all the "regular" keyboard with mini-keyboards (2 from
Fry's, one via ComputerGuys). I really like them. They are similar to the
Happy Hacking keyboards or a notebook keyboard. Small, convenient, not
consuming all the space on the keyboard tray.

  For those who don't need separate numeric keypads or the arrow cluster,
these are really nice to use.

 ifcfg-eth0 and deleted route... files in 2 places.

Dear All,

 

Big thanks to those of you who responded to the plea to help Clark
College develop its UNIX / Linux programs.  The many thoughtful and
well-considered replies you gave are much appreciated.  I hope to get
back around to some of you, who expressed an interest, for more detail.

 

I was struck by some of the replies which mentioned the current
perceived absence of new job openings of UNIX / Linux admins / techs at
any level.  What do you think the situation will be in a year or two?
Is the supply of experienced people now out of work so large as to meet
foreseeable demand?  As the general economy picks up will the need for
new admin / tech talent expand as well?  Where does the next generation
of talent come from?  Is the sysadmin really an endangered species?

 

Will servers now running one of the commercial breeds of UNIX be
replaced by newer systems from the same vendor (eg: IBM, Sun, HP, etc)?
Or will more and more future servers be running some version of Linux?
What will be the UNIX / Linux mix in a year or two or even later down
the line?  Will desktop variants of Linux gain against Microsoft any
time soon, or is this just a pipe dream of Linux enthusiasts?  What is
the meaning of those expensive Linux ads IBM ran during the playoffs and
the Superbowl?

 

Thanks for your time and consideration,

 

Mark

Not as big a problem, since crud has a smaller target, the mouse will
pick up all the crud that falls on the mouse pad, where as the track
ball it is only the ball it'self that is the target.  Works out about
even IME.

I don't know if this is included with Fedora, but the "tpconfig" utility
will do this for you:

I think the most popular setting is the one you wanted: "tpconfig

Message-ID: <1076361958.1283.10.camel@apollo.spears.org>

I got a Jump Drive(USB) for Christmas and just got around to trying it. 
It  mounts fine as vfat, I can write to it and so on.
But:
   1.  This is a general question about file systems and mounting them. 
The mount point ../usbdev is owned by me.  But when I mount the 
device/file system, /dev/sda1, it becomes owned by root.  Since the
underlying file system is vfat, I  can understand why all dirs and files
on the device are owned by  root, but why does it  change  the mount
point?

   2.  Can these USB devices be changed to ext2?

   3.  Can they be partitioned?

For a USB smartmedia reader device (I presume it works the same), this
is what my /etc/fstab entry looks like:

  /dev/sdb1       /smart          vfat    defaults,user,noauto    0       0

Bill>    2.  Can these USB devices be changed to ext2?

I don't see why not.  Of course, my camera isn't going to like that.

Bill>    3.  Can they be partitioned? 

Here's what cfdisk says about /dev/sdb:

                                    cfdisk 2.12

                                Disk Drive: /dev/sdb

I can repartition this block device like any other one.

They CAN, but you have to consider where you'll want to plug the thing.
I can't see the advantage.  Most every system will mount a vfat partition.

>    3.  Can they be partitioned?

Sure.  But I'd again wonder why.  It's not that much space.

Unless you're me and have chronically oily hands, and therefore the
trackball is constantly accumulating junk to run off on the support
posts. (Optical)

OK, so I'll go ahead and chime in here.

I have a top-mounted track-ball (as opposed to the thumb-type) and it's
alright.  I'd really like a decent top-mounted trackball with three
buttons, but they're pretty hard to find (except the >$100 variety, which
I cannot abide).

Anyway, I think I got mine at the Goodwill.  It's labelled Microsoft and
is in decent condition.  It has a scrollbutton and two regular buttons, so
that suits my needs fine.

But it gets dirty really fast... and it has some weird innards that I'd
like somebody here to describe.

It has the regular rubber wheels and when I turn those wheels whilst
cleaning the thing, the cursor moves.  Turn the other wheel and it moves
along the other axis.  Seems perfectly normal.

However, even though that appears to be how the motion is controlled and
the wheel is a solid greenish color, there are two LEDs in the ball
socket.  What the heck are those for?  Anyone?

The whole thing just gets filthy, though.  I haven't tried roughing the
rollers with alcohol to improve its sometimes sticky performance, but I
probably will do that today.

Definitely look for a Trackman fx. It's hard to describe, and they
don't sell it anymore. It has a large ball, but the housing is little
but a skeleton, so the ball has breathing holes on 3 different
sides. Additionally, it's designed so that your hand lies in an
ergonomic position with the thumb resting upwards (no twisting of
bones). There is a button on the left for the thumb, a button to the
right of the trackball, and two buttons lying along the vertical
ridge. The little (4th) button I use for a "back button" and it's
wonderful.

Because it's fully optical, you only have to clean it when you don't
like the resistance or consistency it presents, and every time it's
back to rolling like glass.

Mine were only $40 new (each -- I have two).

The latest Microsoft trackball seems to have finally got their head
out of their ass and is similar. Logitech doesn't make anything so
elegant anymore in their obsession with making everthing wireless and
"stylish".

I've heard of opto-mechanical mice before. No idea how they work.

CompUSA has a house brand with a clearcase about $30 I have about 6 at

Are there any CompUSA stores in sane, livable spaces or are they all in

I just want to know where I can get an IBM-M keyboard in PS/2 or USB,
with hyper and super keys (usually mislabelled by the manufacturer as

I have a machine that I do not have access to that nautilus (gnome
2.4) is hung.  According to ps, it is in "Uninterruptable sleep".
I killed X and Gnome will not restart.  I'm trying to avoid rebooting
but I can't seem to kill the process.  Any suggestions?
Tried "kill -9 472" and "killall nautilus" as root.  Restarted gdm and
X.

Subject: [PLUG] Remapping buttons in X windows
Message-ID: <20040210061107.GA28105@gate.kl-ic.com>

X windows question.  

I am using Win4Lin to run a @$%##! windoze program, mea culpa.  The
windoze program works best with a three button mouse, but will work
with a two-button spanning kludge; if you hold down ALT while you
press the left mouse button, the program will pretend it is seeing
the middle mouse button.  The current version of Win4Lin only passes
info for two buttons, so I am using this kludge a lot.  The problem
comes in when the program also expects SHIFT and CTRL as modifiers;
it is like playing a game of Twister on my keyboard.

I believe it is possible to remap mouse buttons in X, but I do
not know how.   What I would like to do is translate middle
mouse button to ALT&leftbutton when I am in the Win4Lin window,
leave it alone elsewhere.  

I will settle for a script that sets up the translation, and another
that removes it, when I fire up that program.  This may involve
fiddling with xmodmap and xev, but hopefully somebody has already
done something like this and can save me some frobbing.  I am
usually running gnome, if that makes any difference.

Linux Embedded Appliance Firewall

Linux Embedded Appliance Firewall
What is it?
An easy to use embedded Linux network appliance for use in small office,
home office, and home automation environments. Although it can be used
in other ways, it's primarily used as a gateway/router/firewall for
Internet leaf sites.


Project Goals:
Create an inclusive environment for current developers of the Linux
Router Project to release their modifications to the public. Support
continued development of Linux Router Project derived LEAF images and
packages. Create a new LEAF version based on an embedded Linux
distribution with 2.4 kernel support, while retaining the option to
install the target environment on a floppy attached to the target.

Steve, thanks for the help.  I couldn't  connect to the site, but I
found an rpm, which I installed.  When I booted, I still had the
touching problem (perhaps I should reword that).  I checked
/var/log/messages and found that tpconfig was timing out waiting for
something from the kernel.  The error msg suggested that perhaps I had
not applied a kernel patch. So now I'm confused.  I did not get the
impression from INSTAll and README that I had to do that with the rpm.

I think it may be simpler  to have my left thumb amputated. :)

Well, the Debian package comes with patches in /usr/share/doc for
various kernels. I suggest looking for things like these either in the
RPM (rpm -ql), or on the web site.

I don't know much about kernel patching, but the versions don't match,
so I better avoid it.[2.4.2 vs 2.2.22-1.2149]

Subject: [PLUG] USB-Storage Hotplug Script?
Message-ID: <20040210213844.GA682@nellump.net>

I seems unbelievable to me, but I've been unable to find a
general-purpose hotplug script that can handle the automatic mounting
and unmounting of usb-storage devices (thumbdrives, digital cameras,
card readers, etc.). I did discover one posted to a Red Hat mailing list
last summer, but it was geared only towards mounting a single
flash-on-keychain type of device. I have several usb-storage based
devices, and a few other non-USB devices that make use of the
SCSI-generic layer.

So, in the spirit of the scratch-your-own-itch philosophy of open
source, I rolled my own solution. It began as a few hacks to the script
I found on the Red Hat list, but quickly turned into a 95% rewrite. It's
set up so that it will (should) handle the automatic mounting and
unmounting of any usb-storage device that it's been told about. If
anyone is interested, I can post the script to the list.

Basically, I'm wondering if perhaps I didn't look hard enough before
creating my own solution. Not that it really matters at this point,
though. :-)

Well, duh! Post away. I have to look in messages or use lsusb -x, then
convert to sd? then mount.

If you insist...  :-)

I think that the script is fairly self-explanatory -- it's
well-commented. If there's any need for elaboration, feel free to ask.

Note that this has only been tested on my system. I think it works
fairly well so far, but I expect someone will be able to find a way to
break it. Please read through it (at least the comments) before trying
it out.

And certainly, if there are any suggestions for improvement, fire away!

# 

##
# README!
#
# This is a fairly simple script, and should be able to handle most SCSI-USB
# storage devices.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   1)  A standard set of shell utilities (find, grep, sed, etc.).
#   2)  sg3-utils package (SCSI-generic device utilities). Most likely
#   available as a package from your Linux distribution; if not, visit
#   <http://www.torque.net/sg/#Utilities:%20sg_utils%20and%20sg3_utils>.
#   3)  The 'rescan-scsi-bus.sh' script available from:
#   <http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/rescan-scsi-bus.sh>.
#   NB: The Linux IEEE1394 Project web site contains a warning about the use of
#   automated SCSI bus rescans being somewhat dangerous (possibility of kernel
#   oops). All I can say is that I haven't had any difficulties so far. Caveat
#   hotpluggor.
#
# INSTALL:
#   This script should be located in the "usb" sub-directory of your Linux
#   distributions hotplug config file directory. Usually, this is
#   /etc/hotplug/usb.  This script should be named "usb-storage", and should be
#   executable ('chmod 755 usb-storage' ought to do the trick).
#
# CONFIGURATION:
#   1) Create a mount point for your usb-storage device.
#   2) Create an entry for your device in the "case" structure (which begins on
#   line #88). Use the two existing device entries as examples. They can be
#   deleted if they describe devices you don't happen to have.
#
# TO-DO:
#   1)  Send the script's output to an appropriate logging facility. It's
#   probably not safe to assume that all systems will tolerate output to TTY8.
#   2)  More robust error-handling would be nice. Specifically, when searching
#   for sg->sd device mappings; mounting sd devices; etc.
#   3)  Is there anyway to get 'sg_map' and 'rescan-scsi-bus' to shut up? They
#   generate far too much syslog noise.
#   4)  Add support for the simultaneous mounting of multiple partitions.
#
# Note that there are simpler means of determining /dev/sg* -> /dev/sd* device
# mappings when you're using devfs with a 2.4 kernel. Likewise, I believe sysfs
# in the 2.6 kernel provides similar shortcuts. This script is designed to work
# with a standard device node filesystem, in combination with a 2.4 kernel. It
# may or may not work with differently arranged systems. YMMV.
#

Perhaps the binary you grabbed isn't fully compatible with Fedora?

Try getting the Source RPM and installing/building from there:

http://www.compass.com/tpconfig/tpconfig-3.1.3-1.src.rpm

Perhaps this needs to be run before the X server comes up and grabs the
mouse?

So far you are correct.

It is possible, however, unlikely.  I am the only one going to be using
the script so I'll know not to put in blank lines for input.  If I were
to be releasing en masse I would put a check to make sure that there is
in fact valid input entered.  Thus, in theory, there should be no blank
lines or timestamps in the <DataOfInterest> field.

FileA is a "current" file whereas FileB is a "log" file where things
that are no longer current are put.

No, it is a user-run script and since I'm the only one going to be using
it there shouldn't be a write to FileA while I'm trying to read from it.
So a file lock isn't really necessary but it wouldn't hurt either.


Sorry for the massive delay in responding, got really busy for a couple
of days and didn't have a chance to read responses to my questions.
Thanks to all for the help thus far.

I'm finally back on the burn multiple files at different times to the
same CD-R project.

I've got the burner installed on my fedora-Core 1 box and it burns CDs
quite nicely. 

Now to the task. I want a command line method of burning the contents of
a directory onto the CD. I'm sure that involves cdrecord, but I cannot
find the switch that allows it to be done multi-session. Isn't that the
term I need?

Also- xcdroast strongly suggests that I install the burner in SCSI mode,
is that important to anything else?

I think you have to make an iso image first.

When I use gcombust to do this, it reports the following for mkisofs:

/usr/bin/mkisofs -graft-points -f -R -r -l -J -o/bu1/cd-images/PatriotAct.iso -- PatriotAct/=/usr/home/gepr/notes/PatriotAct/

Then write the iso image to the CD-R with cdrecord.

I'm ignorant on the implications of this; but, it works fine for me
and hasn't damaged anything else.

IDE burners aren't recognized by any Linux CD-burning software that I
know of. You have to use the ide-scsi module to add a SCSI layer on your
IDE device. Look at the Linux CD-burning HOWTO for more info.

XCDRoast seemed to recognize mine; but, warned me that it would be 
slow and probably fail.

Also, I noticed that multi-session burning didn't work in gcombust even
though it has the little radio button for it.

I also have a pretty screwed up, old, cd burner, that barfs everytime
I try to use DAO, which xcdroast requires for multi-session burns...
though it's not clear that cdrecord requires it.

Gnome-toaster says it has multisession capability, but if you want
command line:

The instructions are in /usr/share/doc/cdrecord-xxx/README.multi.  There
is no simple switch mentioned.  Have fun.

Most of the GUI's I've ever used print the command line in a window.

Cut and paste is your friend!

Otherwise ALT-TAB to a terminal, 'ps axwwww | grep cdr| > cdrcommand.sh

(edit the .sh file )

This is best way to do GUIs use them to make the command-line easier,
not to hide it.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0402110950190.16543-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I have some daily reports that I generate using shell scripts and though I
normally reject the HTML e-mail idea I found the reports were much easier
to read with a little HTML.  The issue comes when I use /bin/mail to send
it.  There is no way to set the content type so thought it comes through
nicely to the web based mail client Mozilla Mail (IMAP) show all the HTML
codes and does no formatting.

I looked and found a nice little (shell) script called mimesend, installed
it and then it puked when I tested it.  RHL 8 has no mimencode (a part of
metamail) and since it is a binary I hesitate to grab a copy off a RHL 7.3
system.  Further study makes me think this is not what I want anyway.

I'm looking for a command line method to send HTML encoded (so the MUA 
recognizes them as HTML - Content-Type: text/html) messages.  

Any suggestions?

Linux 2.6.0 changed that.  :-)

IDE CD burning is now supported by the kernel, cdrecord is able to take
advantage of it.  AFAIK, ide-scsi is pretty much broken in 2.6 as far as
CD burning is concerned.

I think this one may be pretty complicated.  Take a look at

The filesystem may have something corrupted on it and needs to be
"fsck"-ed.  Since it's your root filesystem it's a bit hard to unmount it
for a good check.  Find your distribution's "rescue" CD, boot from it, and
fsck /dev/hda2.

You could do this online (maybe) but you could miss problems or even
create more problems by doing so.

My guess is you'll find something big and ugly in /lost+found after you're
done.

Do a `df -i`  which will give you an inode count.  If you've
depleated your store of inodes you can get this message.
Would happen if you have lots of little files.

Hi everyone,

I'm about to leave Portland, because of the job market.  I'm headed for New
York City - just to compare, I applied for two jobs there and got them both
(one as business analyst at the NY Stock Exchange).

But I still can't believe I really have to leave.  Anybody have any
comments about what it's been like finding or holding on to a job here?
I've noticed a possible increase in opening lately - For example, I've
been getting calls from recruiters.  But these usually don't pan out - the
"jobs" that are available are simply still too few, and there are lots of
staffing people chasing the same openings.  For a while though, I'd been
optimistic, and thought that this represented the tip of a coming increase
in openings.  But I've been hold out for 2.5 years waiting for the market
to come back.

Most openings I see are usually _very_ tailored to exact requirements.
I'm not sure how to interpret this; companies that don't want to give
someone ramp-up time, even for a few weeks, on their particular tools in
use.

A final question - me personally, I have extensive experience with all
aspects of Java, have J2EE, but minus the EJB (at my previous positions, we
rolled our own solutions for what EJB offers).  I even have publications in
mags like Dr. Dobb's Journal.  But most (recruiter-related) job postings
specifically mention Weblogic or Websphere.  Are there any companies out
there that would hire someone in my position?

I have ideas for getting EJB experience, but I wish I didn't have to leave
town in order to keep working.

Thanks,
Robb

We're moving our software company from New York to Portland this summer, so
might be able to offer an interesting perspective. There are two major
things to realize about NYC:

  1) It's incredibly expensive. A one bedroom apartment is about
$1700-$2200/month (slightly cheaper in New Jersey or parts of the NYC
burroughs).  A drink at a bar can easily be $10-12. :) Taxes are also
very high if you live in NYC.

  2) Technical talent doesn't seem to be as deep in NYC compared to
Portland. When we advertised for developers in NYC, applicants primarily had
experience as IT developers at financial companies. Portland engineers
seemed to have much deeper talent and experience doing product engineering.

So, all I can say is that hopefully more software companies will see thing
the same way we do and also move to Portland. If you do come to NYC before
you move, we'd be happy to show you around. :)

Regards,
Matt

I think that Robb Shecter said:

>>Anybody have any comments about what it's been like finding or holding on

Robb... you can't be serious!?? :-D  Haven't you been following the recent
threads here???

 Good Heavens, man!!

Don't you know that...

*  ...this is now a pure Java Newsgroup... not a User Group directed at
issues affecting Portland Java developers?
*  ...we don't discuss off-topic issues like jobs, employment, off-shoring,
out-sourcing, or economic policy that affects our making a living at
programming in Java?
* ...everyone here has a job and this newsgroup doesn't really care about
people like you that have to leave the area?
* ...the fact that you cannot find work despite your obvious qualifications
is your problem, not the newsgroups?

But I feel your pain and I am here to help you!  Ironically, since your
livelihood is indeed "in jeopardy", the key is to pose your concern here in
the form of a Java question.  Here is an example:

============================================================================

Dear PJUG,

I cannot get this to compile, can someone help me??


import pdx.job.market.*;
import my.best.skills.*;

public class JavaProgrammer extends Developer implements Valuable,
Hardworking {

	JavaProgrammer () {
		super();
	}
	public static main (String[] args) {

		try {
			getEmployed();
		}
		catch (SeriouslyUnemployedException unex) {
			this.giveUp();
			this.move();
		}
	}
	public Paycheck getEmployed() throws SeriouslyUnemployedException {

		long GAZILLION = 10000;

		Recruiter rec = new Recruiter();
		rec.payFinderFee();
		do {
			wasteTimeInEndlessInterviews();
			sendEndlessResumes();
			// This is currently deprecated.
			appealToPJUGForSuggestions();
			if (rec.actuallyDoesSomethingForMe() == TRUE) {
				return rec.getPaychek();
			}
			attempts++;
		}
		while(rec.getResults == null && attempts < GAZILLION );
		throw UnemployedException();
	}
}// end class JavaProgrammer


Someone at PJUG might then reply to you:
-----------------------------------------
Dear Robb,

Obviously, you cannot call getEmployed()
from the Portland job market "static context"!
-----------------------------------------


See how this works now?  ;-)

OBVIOUSLY, I'm being satirical in lampooning some of the indifference that
certain PJUG members have displayed recently.

*************************************************************
*   I do completely understand your situation, and you have *
*   my VERY sincere wishes for better fortune in NY.        *
*************************************************************

Thank you!  This was brilliant and accurate.

Oh, and I do have some advice for fellow Java job seekers: Broadway Cab
needs night drivers.  7 days/week, 7pm - 7am.  If you can wait 2-3 months
for a background check to go through, then you can be qualified to drive
"Medical Transport" trips, and you should choose to drive a van - you'll be
driving people to doctors visits - no strippers and junkies!

But, make sure you're not late on your $420 weekly lease payment, or you'll
get a $100 penalty added to your account.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0402111545040.31706@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  On my server/workstation here on the LAN, /etc/hosts.allow lets me ssh in
from my notebook when it's on the network or when I use a modem to dial into
my ISP shell account. However, I discovered yesterday, it's not configured
to let me ssh directly from a dynamic IP address elsewhere (and outside the
firewall).

  Is the correct syntax:

sshd <hostname>

to add to /etc/hosts.allow so I can get into my server when I'm not here,
but I have a dhcp-leased IP address?

TIA,

Rich

Message-ID: <1076543477.8551.125.camel@dell.linux.box>

I just installed Mozilla Firefox 0.8.

So far, it seems virtually identical to Firebird 0.7.  A few bugs seem
to have been fixed... my old theme doesn't work... mosex doesn't work...
but I haven't thus far been able to kill keyboard focus on it as I was
able to do in Firebird 0.7 quite regularly.

It seems to render a little bit faster than Firebird did... a few
seconds quicker loading hardocp.com.  I don't have any quantitative
measurements, though, sorry.

It seems to be an okay browser.  :-)

[1] If you don't mind sending it as an attachment you can use mutt
(if you have it):

$ mutt -i messagebody.txt -a report.html you at domain.com

[2] If you do Perl I think MIME::Lite is what you want that does

I'll look at this option.

Yeah this report really shouldn't need perl but I did start it up to
format a file size using the Number::Format module.  It's looking like
it's time to make the whole thing perl.

How does one add a man file? Specificly to my OS X box, and if it is

Get a cribsheet.  Either get the O'Reilly VI book or the tiny pocket
guide if you're going to get a book.

But really, just download a cribsheet and start editting documents... look
things up as you need them and make notes when you see a cool and clever
trick.

Really, these things are best learned by beating your head against them.

Just put it in the MANPATH.

Do themes *ever* work between any two versions of gecko-based

Yeah, I'd agree with that. It handles all my bookmarked sites

If you're going to trust ssh explicitly (I do), then try

A friend of mine frequently told me to use the vim tutorial, vimtutor, 
whenever I asked him how to do something in vi.  I didn't for a long time, 
but was very grateful when I went through it as it was an invaluable 
resource.  It has now become a running joke i.e. "How do you do anything?", 
"vimtutor".  Anyway, it should be installed with a Red Hat distro, if not 
it is part of the vim-enchaned rpm.

Yep...  I'm out of inodes...  I had a Perl script running that was in fact
creating a bajillion little files.  So is there a way to increase my inode
stockpile?  Or do I need to reformat the partition with more inodes...?

tar up the itty bitty files?

It isn't that you'd need to reformat with more inodes, really... you'd
need to reformat with *smaller* inodes (hence making more).

I'd tar up the itty bitty files, though... maybe in a RAMdisk if you
can't spare the inodes to do it.  :-)

Good luck.

If you are going to create a new filesystem and you want to keep all
those itty bitty files, you might also consider a filesystem that
doesn't limit inodes, e.g. reiserfs.

Aye, Reiserfs is just fantastic... almost magical.

Subject: [PLUG] evolution under kde looks hideous
Message-ID: <1076574386.16302.5.camel@zadie>

Hello,

I'm thinking of moving. Gnome has been my friend for a while, but the
KDE desktop is much much nicer. It's just that the applications all
suck. =) So now that I've started a flamewar within my first paragraph,

Does anyone know of a way to make Evolution look halfway decent under
KDE? I've got a somewhat decent theme and a nice style for KDE apps, but
Evolution still comes up with the horribly amorphously rounded corners
buttons and everything keramiky. OpenOffice is fine, even GAIM is
acceptable, it's just Evolution that's all wacked out, begging to be
returned to Gnome.

Anyone?

Jeff

vimtutor is part of the vim package.  I don't think anyone that has vim
doesn't have it.  It builds from the same source as vim.

The easiest method I can think of would be to use Perl and MIME::Lite, 
at least to make a quick little program that you could pipe HTML to and 
have it email you.

If you want to avoid using Perl it would also be pretty easy to generate 
your message manually and pipe it into sendmail. There's only two 
variable headers, date, and content-length, so as long as you can figure 
out those appropriately the rest is pretty static.

For reference here's what a message with html content should look like, 
ready to be piped into sendmail (this is output from a quick little 
MIME::Lite program btw):

Content-Disposition: inline
Content-Length: 61
Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
Content-Type: text/html
MIME-Version: 1.0
X-Mailer: MIME::Lite 2.117  (F2.72; A1.59; B2.21; Q2.21)

Paul,

  Makes sense to me that if I'm going to trust ssh with my
pass{phrase|word}, access and exchanges then I should permit it to decide
that it's only me to let in.

  Change made. Now, I suppose, I'll need to wait for the clinic to test
this.

Thanks,

I'm toying with being able to write automatic backups for a customer.

On my FC1 system, this seems to work. I'm already moving the backups
around based on date on the server, so all of the files I want to burn
are in the same dir. I'll run the command as a cron job. Any thoughts
about it's stability, etc?

  You can make these all one option, '-vvv'.

  This is one way of calling them from scripts:
                   cdrecord -v speed=8 dev=1,0,0 -eject $*
I put the '-v' first and a speed specification second. However, it should
work as expected.

Easy enough, I guessed, but wasn't willing to make a coaster just to

What's the $* for? it looks like the file name spec.

I'm having a hard time mounting the drive after burning it, iso9660
returns as an invalid file system, any clues (even after I have it fix
the drive after burning)

cdrecord -vvvv dev=0,1,0 -multi /home/mydocuments/*.zip

Message-ID: <C72E822C38A44D40938D36E473884BD4027C39F0@beavertn-svr-b4.nike.com>

So I got my MythTV box all working great. Just need to get it on the network so I can have it update the program guide regularly and do CDDB lookups, etc. I got a Linksys WET11 (10baseT ethernet to 802.11b wireless). I plugged it into my Myth box and got no link light, of course it works on my Windows box just fine. I called Linksys support and wasted my time for a while. Then I found Intel's documentation for the e1000 driver. I then adjusted me settings in /etc/modules.conf...

alias eth0 e1000
options eth0 Speed=10 Duplex=2

I then ran...

# ifconfig eth0 down
# rmmod e1000
# insmod e1000 Speed=10 Duplex=2

The WET11 link light came on, but the link light on my Myth box was still off. I tried half duplex also (Duplex=1) and was able to ping the WET11 only briefly. I then looked at dmesg and saw something like...

eth0 link up
eth0 link down
eth0 link up
eth0 link down

It comes up and down a few time and then stays down. Pretty flakey. I am pretty sure that the WET11 is fully functional becuase when I connect it to my other linux box (different NIC), or even my windows box, it works flawlessly. I could pop another network card in my Myth box and it would probably work fine, but I'd rather make it work with the onboard Intel Pro /1000 MT with the e1000 driver, if possible.

Any suggestions how I might troubleshoot this further?

Thanks,

Check your network cable... swap out other network cables... crossover
or straight through?

If it were me, I'd just drop an rtl8139 in there.

Yeah, if you're cabling directly from machine to machine you will need a
crossover cable.

  These may give you some ideas. Also, could some of the environment

The files you a giving aren't iso's, maybe?  If you want to make an
iso9660 CDR, you'll have to run mkisofs somewhere in there.  See the
examples section of the cdrecord manpage.  Something like:

 # mkisofs -R /home/mydocuments/*.zip | cdrecord ... dev=0,1,0 -

I doubt this is doing what you want it to be doing. What it is doing is 
burning each zip file you're passing it directly to the cd as a track. 
This might actually work as a backup method but you'll have to devise 
some way of extracting the data off the cd again because you can't just 
mount it as a regular cd, which is expecting an iso9660 filesystem.

To get it into a filesystem you'll have to pipe it through mkisofs first.

You and Russell have it right. I can make an iso first, then burn that.
I want the files on the CD to be uniquely named./ Does the name of the
iso matter once it's burned?

I'll play with that. 

I've tried 
# mkisofs -R /home/mydocuments/*.zip | cdrecord 

But there seems to be a need for the mkisofs to have a name, not just a
pipe. Does that look like an accurate observation?

  Yes. And I assumed you had already run mkisofs. :-)

  The sample scripts I sent should give you some food for thought (if not
for lunch).

Mike's link at home is out, has been for a couple hours.  He called and
they said they were working on some kind of large-scale problem covering
a nontrivial area (i.e. all of Portland).  Still not up as of right now.

The hyphen in the cdrecord portion, e.g.:

   mkisofs foo | cdrecord dev=bar -

means "use standard input" instead of a named file.  Many unix
commands use that convention.

Again, see the examples in the cdrecord manpage.

Yup.  It is still out in one particular SE Portland neighborhood (at
least).  I've switched my default route to DSL, so I can't say right
now if my Comcast-connection is still hosed. ... okay, I checked, mine
(in NE Portland) is back up.  The still unreachable SE Portland host
is on 24.21.143.xxx.  According to my logs, the outage started there
shortly (within 5 minutes) after 9:08 this morning.

Does anyone know (off hand) where Comcast's outages page is?  I seem
to remember seeing one before, but it the grand tradition of big
telecommunications carriers, they make their websites totally
/sbin/fsck'ing impenetrable and I can't find it at the moment.

                     ^^

That's the device that was giving me problems. That's moot now, since I
just discovered that to read do multi writes, I need to know the cluster
numbers of the last writes. That will keep me from writing automagically
via script. 

I'd like to write the files, one at a time to the drive, keeping the old
files visible.

I'm looking into udf. sourceforge has a few projects. I'll post soonly.

> Again, see the examples in the cdrecord manpage.

Nothing there addresses my -multi desires. (unless the clue stick is
still needed) You've got some cool scripts, I've saved them for future
perusings.

Yeah, it went down just as I left for a job interview, and was back up
when I came home.

Anybody else notice Comcast gives ipv6 numbers as well now?  I noticed
that about two days ago.

They more or less broke ICMP nearly entirely for a while.  That was
truly obnoxious.  I can't say I'm entirely pleased that they think
it's their responsibility to neuter ICMP anyway.

I talked to a guy at school who said his outage started around 8:45 or
so and lasted past when he needed to leave for school.  He was unable to
send in some homework due to the outage.

He is on Comcast.

That's similar, though not identical, to the timeframe I experienced as 
well. I know that I had connectivity until at least 7:30 and it may have 
lasted until closer to 8:00. After that, I was definitely offline.

Message-ID: <8138750.1076635195675.JavaMail.root@gonzo.psp.pas.earthlink.net>

Hello,

How can I connect to the internet using Red Hat 9, a D-Link DI-624 router and a comcast cable modem?  My PC is set up to dual boot Windows and Linux, but the way, and the router/cable modem connects to the internet fine in windows.  

I tried everything I could think of in Red Hat 9 to get the internet connection going; I disabled the firewall, made sure the dhclient process was running using "ps -aux" and made sure eth0 was activated at startup.  By the way, I can enter the router's IP address into Mozilla and go through the router setup wizard in linux just the same as I can in MS windows.  

Do I need to add my router's IP address to one of the dhcp or dns config files?

Thanks,

Dave

If you can reach the router from the linux boot, then you are on the network. Perhaps you do not have a default gateway defined. Run "/sbin/route" and send the output.

Here is the text from the article:

<article>

Neowin has learned of shocking and potentially devastating news. It
would appear that two packages are circulating on the internet, one
being the source code to Windows 2000, and the other being the source
code to Windows NT. At this time, it is hard to establish whether or
not full code has leaked, and this will undoubtedly remain the
situation until an attempt is made to compile them. Microsoft are
currently unavailable for comment surrounding this leak so we have no
official response from them at the time of writing.

This leak is a shock not only to Neowin, but to the wider IT industry.
The ramifications of this leak are far reaching and devastating. This
reporter does not wish to be sensationalist, but the number of
industries and critical systems that are based around these
technologies that could be damaged by new exploits found in this source
code is something that doesn't bare thinking about.

We ask that for the wider benefit of the IT community that members and
readers support Microsoft by forwarding anything they know about the
leak to the Microsoft's Anti-Piracy department.

Please do not post any links/screenshots/hints or anything to do with
the source code outbreak. Discussion is allowed but we will not condone
people spreading this source code.

I found while searching slashdot a link to a file listing all of the files, 
and the total in the "windows 2000 source code" archive.

What really gets me here is that at the end it notes that windows 2000 source 
code includes a grand total of 30915 files. 

Now compare that to my research of creating a quick program to process a file 
outputted by "ls -Rl > testfile; grep total testfile > newtestfile" which 
then gives me a few thousand lines that say "total xxxx" then i went into 
kwrite and did a replace all on "total " to ""...then i created a program to 
add up those numbers. I then came up with a grand total of 252312 files.

Where does someone claim to have the source code to Windows 2000, and not even 
have 100k files.   30915 compared to 252312(even if you did take out all the 
other arch's wouldn't compare). This is most clearly a hoax, unless someone 
can prove me otherwise by providing a count from the "real leaked source 
code".

Check out the article on news.com ... it's supposedly part of the code,

The source code for Linux 2.6.1 contains 15000 files.  I used "find 
-type f | wc" to do the count.  Either you miscounted or kwrite has lots 
of tiny, little files.

31,000 files for Windows 2000 doesn't sound unreasonable.  A line count 
would be a more accurate estimate of the amount of source code.

Okay you can completely forget i even SAID that....now that i take notice that 
number that shows up when you do ls -l, for example "total 2792" means the 
number of KB used in that directory....i don't know how on earth i was 
thinking that it meant number of files in the directory. so i guess windows 
sounds right....250 megs.....sure....but that the total is 40 gigs or 
more(according to news.com), which is just absolutely crazy for an operating 
system....how does one start with 40 gigs of source code, and end up with 1 
single cd for the product? i just don't get it.

With some of the most "perfect" timing I've ever seen, Nagios and MySQL
conspired last night to fill our webserver's disk with nearly 1.7GB of
logs, consisting of Nagios saying "Wheee! balin is up and pings in X
ms." and "Wheee! dwalin is up and pings in Y ms."  Logs were coming at a
rate of maybe 100 *per second*.

After shooting Nagios in the head, everything settled down.  Now we're
going to figure out what possessed MySQL to log every single query in
excruciating detail, and slap that down.

So.... if you couldn't get to our website over the last 16 hours, this
would be why.  None of our other machines, services, or customers were
affected, just our ability to *get* new customers <sigh>.

I'm finally back on the burn multiple files at different times to the
same CD-R project.

I've got the burner installed on my fedora-Core 1 box and it burns CDs
quite nicely. 

Now to the task. I want a command line method of burning the contents of
a directory onto the CD. I'm sure that involves cdrecord, but I cannot
find the switch that allows it to be done multi-session. Isn't that the
term I need?

Also- xcdroast strongly suggests that I install the burner in SCSI mode,
is that important to anything else?

Hmm, this was resent to the list a week ago after I subscribed this
address, with a note to kill the message waiting in the queue.  Oh
well.  More perfect timing ;-)

Have you verified the e1000 works with something else? Do you still see
the flaky behavior?

Is this right?  Is there something I need to set up under System/Network/ethernet card?  Should I add anything to the /etc/dhclient...conf file?  

Thanks!

Dave

P.S. In MS windows I checked under control panel/network/TCP-IP/advanced for any special gateway entered by the guy who installed the cable modem, but all it says is DHCP enabled.

Subject: RH9 internet access via D-Link router/comcast cable modem

Hello,

How can I connect to the internet using Red Hat 9, a D-Link DI-624 router and a comcast cable modem?  My PC is set up to dual boot Windows and Linux, but the way, and the router/cable modem connects to the internet fine in windows.  

I tried everything I could think of in Red Hat 9 to get the internet connection going; I disabled the firewall, made sure the dhclient process was running using "ps -aux" and made sure eth0 was activated at startup.  By the way, I can enter the router's IP address into Mozilla and go through the router setup wizard in linux just the same as I can in MS windows.  

Do I need to add my router's IP address to one of the dhcp or dns config files?

Thanks,

Dave

I think you should look at growisofs from dvd+rw-tools. it supports CD
as well as DVD media.

It's pretty straightforward, actually.

First, a good number of the files in the source tree are no longer
actively part of the product.

Second, a good number of the files are instructions for the build process
and contain no code that is compiled into the product.

Third, a good portion of the actual code contains non-instructive comments
and whitespace.

Fourth, the source tree contains code for multiple hardware architectures.

Fifth, compilation is a reduction in space such that long instructions
meant for humans to read and write can often be reduced to a single byte
of machine code.

Lastly, the compiled binaries are then compressed into archives for
distribution on CD.

Consider, even that the Linux kernel (2.4.20) is around 160MB of text and
compiles with every module down to about 10MB for a given architecture.
And that's just the kernel.  The higher level code is less dense and more
abundant.

Yeah, I heard about that on the BBC World Service before KOPB-FM's
transmitter went out while I was driving home from a late shift.
Tried switching to KOPB-AM, but it turns out my truck's engine and
turn signals throw off lots of 550KHz interference, and KOPB-AM is
almost as weak as Benson High School's KBPS-AM transmitter...

Not really.  I've heard from more than one reliable source that
Microsoft programmers are on a line quota.  In another words, each
code monkey has to consistently hit a minimum number of lines of code
per day or they're sacked.  Thanks to this, we will probably never
know how much of that code is actually effective and not just the
programmers trying to bulk it up, and only time will tell just how
long Microsoft's business model lasts before it collapses onto itself
in giant balls of spaghetti code reminiscent of the ending of Akira or
the Trapper Keeper episode of South Park.

Wow, for a Linux user, you really missed the writing on the wall.  It
happens in much the same way 183MB of kernel source gets whittled down
to a 1.2MB kernel image.

Neowin's authors are definitely sub-intelligent.  This was a problem
they should have been worrying about all along with closed-source
software.  You will only find critical security concerns when you
develop in the dark and some rogue with access to the archives and
releases the code.  This is a crippling flaw in all closed-source
software, and reason enough why nobody should use it.

Message-ID: <1076691240.6186.9.camel@kat.zotnet.com>

So I bought a labtec 711 usb headset (LVA-8711).

I can lock the system repeatedly.....


Method:

Reboot
Log into X
Plug in Headset
run kphone (3.14, http://www.wirlab.net/kphone/ built with checkinstall)
Ensure it is pointing at /dev/dsp1
Connect to asterisk server on local net.
Listen to the popping sound.  Think about further testing.
Watch call get disconnected.
See Kphone start to blank window.
Wonder why it stopped.
Notice the mouse stopped working (not too unusual with Sond apps as they
sometimes slow things down).
Notice the blinking caps lock and scroll lock.
Wonder if I was running windows.

OS:  RH9, stock updated kernel: 2.4.20-28.9
Sound:  Alsa, built from fresh rpms src rpm: kernel-module-alsa-0.9.8-1.fr_2.4.20_28.9


This system almost never locks up otherwise.  It is my workstation and
gets lots of abuse.

Any ideas before I pound on the alsa lists?

Thanks!

Is that the IP address of the router thingy you can ping?

If so, good.  If not, bad.

Now, we've established at least that DNS does not work.  What about just
plain getting out?

Can you ping my UML's IP of 65.19.161.203?  If so, you just need to set
up DNS.  If not, then things are more messed up than that.

Rather than reformatting the drive or switching to ReiserFS how about 
changing the Perl to write fewer files that contain all the data?

Yes. The e1000 works with just about anything else. I can connect this linux box to my linksys router and it works fine. I can even use it with the WET11 if I connect them both to a hub. It only fails to work when connected directly to the WET11. I am going to try a different NIC this weekend. That should make it work, but the mystery remains.

Here are some talking points that occur to me:

* "[T]he $100 saved." Windows for $100? I think not. The OS alone
  *might* cost you that much if it's an upgrade or preinstalled, but
  certainly not if you had to buy it outright. And what about the cost
  of MS Office or Mr.  Schieberl's web-dev tools?

  Plus, he mentions working with 'Windows servers.' Has he priced them
  lately? If he can get a Windows Server OS for $100, he ought to let
  the rest of us know about it...

* "Most people use their computers for business, Web browsing, email
  and printing pictures in a thought-free environment." Oh, that
  explains the legions of gamers, computer audiophiles, bloggers, and
  maintainers of hobbyist web sites!

  I'd say that thought-free users don't care about their OS. As long
  as IT can keep it running, the world is OK.

  In fact, many people put serious time into understanding their
  computers and applications. Knowledge is hard-won, regardless of
  whether someone is running Free or proprietary software.

* "Poor security in Windows is a thing of the past." Last week? Last
  month? How does he explain the monthly (if not weekly) virus
  outbreaks?

* "Open-source software generally suffers coding inconsistencies and
  untreated bugs." I guess this is true if you consider every
  open-source project worldwide, version 0.01 and above. It's
  certainly far less true of widely used projects.

Dear All:

I have a bunch of VCD format movies in CD that I want to dd out
to my harddrive as iso.

So I did this:

   mount /dev/cdrom
  dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/usr/local/cdfile.iso

The iso file created:

    -rw-r--r--    1 root     root       450560 Feb 13 09:39 
/usr/local/cdfile.iso

I know my movie is bigger than that.  Not sure why it is only such a small 
file.
Did I do something wrong or other there other dd options I need to provide?

Just for testing, I used cdrecord to burn the iso back to a CD-R.  The 
medium could not be recognized by any CD-drive....

Any tips much appreciated.

Of course it is a thing of the past.  And the present and future.  Between
the time Mr. ___ wrote his letter and it was published in Willamette Week
yet another high-risk vulnerability was disclosed and Windows administrators
were scrambling to apply the patch to remidy the problem.  

Worse yet, it was disclosed that Microsoft sat on the knowledge of the 
vulnerability for six months without releasing a patch.

  See related thread from a couple of days ago. Then read 'man mkisofs'
before reading 'man cdrecord'.

  dd is a bit-by-bit copy. It does not make an iso file system. CD-rom
drives expect an ISO file system on their media.

I have now a even more peculiar problems.
There are 2 files on the VCD that I cannot read at all:

[root at var0289 local]# mkisofs -o testcd.iso  -V disc1 /mnt/cdrom
mkisofs: Input/output error. cannot read from '/mnt/cdrom/cdi/cdi_imag.rtf'

[root at var0289 cdi]# file cdi_imag.rtf

The rtf file is one of them.  The other is .dat file.
Same result.

Any reason why this is the case?

Since I'm not running Fedora... I'm assuming the above line outputted
B?  FWIW, I got no output running the above line on any of my slackware
boxes or my gentoo laptop.

um, beg to differ here, but the 'cure' is:

$ echo B | grep -i [a-z]

It's good to keep upper and lower case distinct.  Unless you explicitly want
them munged together.

Yeah, not at all clear what the desired result he wanted was.

Another caveat -- if there are any files called "a", "b", et. al. bash
will do glob expansion on [a-z] so you'd better either escape or
single-quote.

Ahhhh

You and cooper are wrong here.


This *should* have worked perfectly.

as Rich said, dd is a "bit copy" which means it will use the file system
from the VCD.

Now, the question is, is a VCD a iso filesystem?  According this it is:

http://www.vcdimager.org/documentation.phtml


Which begs the question can you just mount it, and pull the mpegs of
directly?

If so, than something foobared with dd.

As a test get a good cdrom, and 

dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/tmp/test.iso

You do have 600Mb of disk space right?

SAVOR TIME

What should've been an article on the Open Source Development Lab and
its mission turned into a Linux soapbox. "The Rebel Alliance" [WW,
Jan.  28, 2004] let slip the secret that that Linux is the savior of
the digital universe because it doesn't cost Windows' $350 on the
desktop or $2000/user for servers. But the security and performance of that
free operating system far exceeds any amount of money saved.

Linux finds a home where people value freedom, choice and time spent
using computers rather than fighting or fearing them.  Most people use
their computers for business, Web browsing, email and printing pictures
in a thought-free environment. As a professional chip designer and
amateur Web developer, I look at the profit margin. I've worked on Unix
and Linux since 1993. The time I save working with Linux on a day by
day basis dramatically justifies the initial investment.

Poor security in Windows is a thing of the past, present and future.
Windows integrates its software into every level of access to the
machine, allowing viruses and security holes to be exploited through a
variety of means. Linux's security works independently of its
third-party components (e.g., Apache), which is a source of great
strength.  Worried about the security of a piece of Linux?  Turn if off
or uninstall it, and Linux keeps on working.  Windows will not (not
cannot) offer you this control over your own computer.

Open source is not limited to Linux. Open-source communities exist for
many programming languages and operating systems. Microsoft's
developers' network provides complete references and tutorials for
their operating system and software--and their seamless integration for
a lot of money.  Open source software offers all of the same, for free,
as well as providing routes where you can pay for support if you want
it.  However, in over a decade of using Linux I can personally say that
I've spent less than a total of $50 for support of Linux.

However, there's something to be said for software that comes
from paid programmers.  That's why companies like AOL supports
Mozilla, the open source web browser, and Sun Microsystems supports
Open Office, the open source office software, and why IBM has
invested more than 1 billion dollars in Linux.  With open source,
therefore, you can have the best of both worlds.

Many Linux users spite Microsoft or like to show off tech skills, and
the same is true of any community, there are a few extremists who
don't respect your freedom to choose.

This is a grep issue:

man grep:

       Within a bracket expression, a range expression consists of two charac-
       ters separated by a hyphen.  It matches any single character that sorts
       between the two characters, inclusive,  using  the  locale?s  collating
       sequence  and  character  set.   For  example, in the default C locale,
       [a-d] is equivalent to [abcd].  
>>>>>>>>
       Many locales sort characters in dictio-
       nary  order,  and in these locales [a-d] is typically not equivalent to
       [abcd]; it might be equivalent to [aBbCcDd], for  example.   To  obtain
       the  traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the
       C locale by setting the LC_ALL environment variable to the value C.

Correct.  Hence my surprise.  Perhaps I missed something during the
install, but I had no LC_ALL set to anything. I did have

So it picked up something about English.  I haven't looked, but I don't
remember seeing the recommended class notation [:lower:] used anywhere. 

I think it is at least bug-like.  It certainly could give a nasty
surprise.

um doesn't grep -i mean ignore case, ie munge them.  If you're using
Fedora then you better set LC_ALL=C.

I meant on a cdrom you know is good (mountable).

It should be 600MBs or so.

My thoughts exactly. I just thought it should have been set.
BTW, LC_ALL=C goes in /etc/profile right?

Yeah that's what I ended up doing.  It was just easier at the time for the
problem I was solving to create lots of little files.  I also went through
and removed all the files in my working directory that ended up with zero
size:

find . -empty -type f -exec rm {} \;

HI all,
I'm looking to see if anyone is using SuSe 8 and what their opinion is
on it as compared to earlier versions and against other distros.
NOT LOOKING FOR:
a flame war on distros
a blind,one-sided fanaticism
a blatant, religious, fanatical dissertation

I AM looking for some honest user comments as to how it feels and
reacts and such.

I'm moving away from Redhat and thought I'd give SuSe a try.

It's not so much that it's critical of Linux and Free software, but
that the entire content of the letter is classic Microsoft F.U.D., and
it reeks of a shill. The author's laughable assertions that security
issues are a thing of the past with Windows is the first dead giveaway.

Depending on the disc: sorta.  The VCD format is nominally ISO9660, but
there is an diffent "book" mode that is not directly readable via the
standard ISO filesystem.

The difference is that while mode 1 uses exclusively the standard
2048-byte sectors, mode 2 makes use of the same larger sectors that Red
Book audio disks use, at 2352 bytes.  From
linux-2.4.24/include/linux/cdrom.h:

* - audio (red):             | audio_sample_bytes |
*                            |        2352        |
* - data (yellow, mode1):    | sync - head - data - EDC - zero - ECC |
*                            |  12  -   4  - 2048 -  4  -   8  - 276 |

As you can see, the difference is that normal data CDs include a third
level of error correction beyond the two provided by the physical
media.  Audio CD's don't use this, and in order for many VCDs to make
use of the additional space (this is the difference between the 800MB
and 700MB quoted on many CD-R's), they screw with the ISO filesystem by
having it point to "sectors" that are 2352 bytes.

The Linux filesystem is incapable of dealing with these disks, so you
have to write some funky code to deal with them.  I did so 3 or so years
ago, and the code made its way into GStreamer.  You can find it here:

http://freedesktop.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/gstreamer/gst-plugins/sys/vcd/

The main function of interest is vcdsrc_get().

A quick & dirty googling of Steve Schieberl shows (1) he doesn't seem to
be in the pay of Microsoft, but (2) he's far from being the biggest geek
in Portland; if he's the biggest geek he knows, he must not know one.
29 posts to the mailling list of the "HTML Writer's Guild, one mention
that he's a former student of an introductory web design class
(apparently he attended some time in 1998 or 1999), & credit for a
single web site -- a virtual swap market that is far smaller in scale than
Craig's List, let alone eBay.

In other words, some lost soul trying to suck up to Gates & Co. in hope
it might further his career. As Paul Mulen wrote, "I have better ways
to spend my time than taking such bait."

Never tried it, but I know there are programs that do it.  cdrecord is
capable of writing CDs at an even lower level (2352-byte sectors plus
the 96-byte P-W checksumming layer), so if you have a program that is
capable of constructing an image with 2352-byte sectors you can burn
VCDs in this format.  However, this is only needed if the contents of
the disk exceed what a 2048-byte sector disc can store.

Google or freshmeat will probably reveal several programs designed to
construct VCD images and handle burning them to a CD.

Right off the cuff, and I'm not checking because no time.

1) We know that the dd thing only records 40 MB's even if not an iso

2) We know that the system bombs on creating the iso

Is is possible that there is a scratch about 40 MB's into the disk?

That would reconcile what's happening. Do you have another VCD that you
can check?

Hmm, this reminds me of something I had happen a long time ago. I 
didn't think much of it at the time, but this sounds like the same 
thing.

I had a data CD that I used dd to dump on a Solaris box.  I got a file 
that was a valid ISO image.  I did the same thing on a Linux box (2.2 
days) and got a steaming pile of bits that had little relation to an 
ISO image. I never did figure out what the problem was.  Instead I 
mounted the CD, copied the files and made my own image.  I remember 
that the file dropped by dd on Linux was not the same size as the 
file Solaris created, but I don't remember if it was smaller or 
larger.  It wasn't much different (i.e. not 40MB vs. 640), but it was 
different.

Could that have been a related problem?  Back in the 2.2 days, Linux 
had problems with sector sizes other than 512 bytes or multiples 
thereof.

Best,
Kyle

Not completely true.  In the recent past, I had similar trouble. I had
burned some .iso's but I couldn't dd them back to the disk.  What I
found was that if burned with the DAO option dd worked if not it
wouldn't quite copy the whole iso. (When mounted the cdrom file system
was correct!)

  Yup. It was probably someone digging a hole. Just imagine the time to put
all those little fibers back together again so they match properly! Whew!
And, the workers had to be sure they didn't get glue on the faces or other
fibers. Microtechnology at work.

Sort of how like newspapers mis-report that a vehicle was at fault,
when it was the idiot driver at the helm.  Rush would be worth the
wasted bandwidth in the electromagnetic spectrum if he did nothing but
the SUV Update, and didn't limit it to SUVs.  Sort of a
wreckedexotics.com for the radio.

And if anybody wonders why I was listening to Rush, it's because by
last November, I had heard pretty much everything FM had to offer.
KOPB *really* needs to put Performance Today on in the middle of the
night when nobody cares and put the BBC World Service on after Morning
Edition...there's just nothing really good on at 9-12 other than Clark
Howard, and I'm not a huge fan of call-in talk radio.

Subject: [PLUG] Mozilla Mail IMAP settings
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0402131716430.30996-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I've been having a great time playing with Mozilla Mail as an IMAP client.  
Since I'm forced to use a Windows system for my desktop at work I hesitate 
to fiddle with Evolution.
   So here I am trying to get all my systems acting the same and trying to 
recover for using the Web Interface our mail server software provides and 
find I'm at a stand still.  I have a folder showing on one system that 
does not exist on the server and can't get rid of it.  I keep getting an 
'Operation not Permitted' error when I try to delete it from the IMAP 
client system.

I went looking for the information through the file system but failed to 
find anything that looked even close to what I needed.  I wanted to try a 
sledge hammer method to remove the folder.

Beside the source code is there anywhere else I can look for where this 
is kept?


TIA,
Rod

VCDs are a unique sort of beast. I believe it is an ISO9660 filesystem, 
but it's on two seperate tracks, which may be why you're only getting 40 
megs or so, dd might only be ripping the first track.

vcdxrip will pull out all the data you need, including all the meta 
information, and leave you with a straight mpeg. You can then repackage 
it as a vcd image again with vcdxbuild if you want to burn a copy, but 
unless your goal is simply to copy the cd you'll probably want to 
extract it out anyway.

I think you should be able to create a loop-back file system with
reiserfs, leaving the original file system alone, and being able to
mount some thing that will take in all those little files.

Good Luck,

I need a label printer that uses ribbons (wax or resin), does around 
100-200 dpi, and uses open source drivers.  (Or at least will work with 
cups.) Low cost per label is an added plus.

Suggestions?

Help! There's three different amavis's out there! Debian seems to
suggest that only amavis-ng and amavisd-new are "current". With my
qmail setup I can do pre-smtp exec chaining and I can do mid-smtp
queue filtering (pseudo-milter, if you will, uses a text
pipeline). Anybody have any guidance? Thanks

amavisd-new is my choice.  I dunno about using it with Qmail.  Here's a
draft of a paper I've written about using it with Postfix; it might give
you insight into using it with Qmail.

Ah, okay. That helps make the absolutely horrid amavisd-new/qmail
"howto". Looks like they were setting up an "intranet smtp" for
amavisd to proxy to or some similar bizarre thing. I think I'll focus
on amavis-ng, then.

Thanks for the clear and concise description of how amavisd-new works!

amavisd-new and -ng work pretty much the same, either as an internal
proxy or Milter.  The main difference is whether you want SpamAssassin
or not (and even if you don't, -new can turn it off).  -new sees a good
deal more development and activity from what I can tell; take a look
over the amavis-users mailing list.

Yeah, go check out http://ursine.ca/~baloo/ and click on "superior
solution."  It doesn't use amavis, but it does use clamav with exim to
reject virus infected emails at SMTP-time.

Trust me, your sanity will improve moving away from qmail, what with
not having 14 bajillion meaningless files and bizarre licensing that
makes you wonder just what in the hell DJB is smoking and where one
can get some.

You might want to go email that to debian-user at lists.debian.org with a
good writeup, debian-user allows nonsubscribers to post and I know
this has come up over there.

I've been coding my own qmail features for a couple years now. I have
a very nice build system, and I enjoy the source code and software
style. Thank you very much.

Anyone know how to fix this error?  I tried to look it up on google and got
1 fix that didn't work.


When I log into KDE I get the following error:
"There was an error setting up interprocess communication in KDE.  The
message returned by the system was:
could not read network connection list. /root/dcopserver_dlen 192.168.1.1:0
please check that "dcopserver" program is running"

Its because of the DNS entries I messed up isn't it?  Is this a recoverable
error or am I hosed?
Thanks in advance for any help!

You're never hosed.  Well, almost never.

What's /etc/hosts look like?

SuSE has been my distribution of choice for a while. I would say 8.0 is
one of my least liked reversions. 8.0 is when SuSE made the jump to
yast2and being a long time yast user it wasn't in my opinion ready.


The current SuSE is 9.0 and yast2 is now pretty good. The default
install is pretty easy to doon most hardware. If you come up against  a
wall the install is flexible enough where you can probably install
around the issue. 

The documentation that comes with the distribution is pretty good. I
would recommend buying a boxed set just to get the documentation for
someone new to SuSE. I've heard complaints about SuSe not being
intuitive from users that didn't read the two books included in the box
set.  I never read through the books, but dog eared them going back time
and time again I probably read 90% of the books, but just not front to
back. 

As much as i like SuSE I have to admit it is a personal choice, and I
first started with SuSE because the 5 CDs pretty much meant I wouldn't
have to keep downloading over a 26000 baud connection as I climbed the
learning curve.. This was way before I knew about debian and I don't
know dedian history to know if it was around in 96. 

Over the years I have resisted debian because it always seemed the most
annoying Linux users where debian users. I just never wanted to be
associated with debian because of this, no matter how"good" it was. Stay
with me, I'm getting to my point and don't mean this to be a flame; as
much as I like SuSE, and I really do like SuSE, if I was going to invest
in learning the ins and outs of a new distribution, I would start with
debain before, or if, SuSE at all. 

I'm thinking that SuSE is in for change, and what was the past is not
an indication of the future with Novel. dedian will probably be the
better long term solution for users and probably for "smart" businesses
as well.

It is sad that the mainstreaming of Linux means less and less thought
will be given to users and more and more thought will be about making
products for businesses. It is sad because, at some time in the future,
there will be more users outside of the Linux community than in. Linux
will be a vendor, not someone you have beer with, talked to at the last
LUG meeting, or flamed on the mailing list. It will be some loud, big
smile, lunch buying, promise you anything, vendor that the new geeks
associate with Linux. 

I think debian will be the last Linux user community. It exists because
of its community structure. When that community dies, Linux will be
dead. The last Linux flame will probably be on a debian mailing list. 

Thank you
Russell

Apparently on Fedora, it doesn't.  Lacking guidance from any Linux
Gurus, I put it in /etc/profile.

Looks just like the lines in my httpd.conf, Have you checked to be sure
that the "oh" isn't indeed a zero, and that the access module has been
re-loaded, and that the module is in tact?

I think apache is interpreting "Order allow,deny" as a tag. Make sure
there is a <Directory> above it.

I've been using Yum to keep my work and home systems updated, and in

The "oh" in Order is correct. I actually changed it to "o" and "0" then
back again just to make sure. 

The access module is there and I guess intact.

That is actually one of the first things I tried, but got different
errors like... Invalid command '<Directory>'  Upon looking at other
apache configs, they are all like what is listed above.

Try some simple rpm operation just to make sure your rpm database isn't
hosed with a stale lock or something. A good test is:

   rpm -qa

If that hangs then you have an rpm problem. Otherwise its a yum problem.

Yes, I am pretty sure it is.  T1s are what... 64 wires?  They can split
those up between data and voice.

Yes.

You can get your 24 channels of DS0 bundled almost any way you choose
these days.

The telco has to support the service, though, as it requires peculiar end
equipment both for them and on the customer premises.

Um, no.  That's not how apache configs work.

Global commands can go outside of directives, but "Order" is not a global
command.  It MUST be contained within a directive... in this case,
enclosed within <Directory foo ></Directory> (where "foo" is some
directory on which you'd like the commands to apply).

Scroll backward from this point in your httpd.conf and see where the next
opening directive is hiding.  If it's a closed directive </Something>,
then you need to open your Directory directive and specify the location to
which it applies.

Yeah, as others have said it is possible. It is what we have at my office. We 
use integra for everything at my work.

I'm not sure about any others in the portland metro area that do both, but 
everything I have done with integra has been smooth and their support is 
good.

Actually, a T1 is 4 wires containing 24 channels. I know that qworst can 
segment the channels to have data and/or voice on any or all channels.

4 wires (two pair, unloaded) because you have a pair for receiving, and 
a pair for transmitting.

This is accurate.  ELI figured out it can sell in the pure margins after
10 phone lines pure T1.  i.e. They make money at 10 lines, so sell
something for the other 14.  The something could be Login Distance
trunking, tie-ins to other offices, or IP traffic.

The prices are real cheap at that point.

I would not call it "peculiar" it is specific in that it must be able to
break the T1 into two different channels.  There are dozens of options.

If it works with a hub and you've confirmed you have set the speed
and duplex, then it might be flow control 

FlowControl
Valid Range: 0-3 (0=none, 1=Rx only, 2=Tx only, 3=Rx&Tx)
Default: Read flow control settings from the EEPROM
    This parameter controls the automatic generation(Tx) and
response(Rx) to     Ethernet PAUSE frames.

 I would also try the AutoNeg setting instead of setting both Speed and
Deplex. Setting it to 3 will mean it will auto-negotiation up to 100
full duplex but not the 1000 full. 

You might want to try the latest driver as well.

Thank you

Ok, I understand now. I wasn't looking far enough back. It's all there.
I guess I was expecting the whole directive to be together, instead of
spread out with comments slapped in between.

Well this is mostly true. If you are not getting a default route with
your DHCP lease, then if your name server is not local, it could appear
to be a DNS issue when it is in fact, a routing issue. 

It always helps to trouble shoot from the bottom up. Simplified: wires,
MACs, routing, and then the applications. DNS is an application.

Thank you

No, but we do seem to be experiencing a Scott Van Hoosen hijacking

If you look closely at the email I sent... we established connectivity
to the router itself, so the next step was establishing connectivity
with the rest of the Internet... routing.  :-)

If the ping went through to an IP on the Internet, then it would appear
routing was working.  If a ping did not go through to an IP on the
Internet, then routing is not working.

If routing was working, then it would appear to be a DNS issue we were
facing.  In my experience, people usually use a web browser or ping a
domain name to test Internet connectivity... so if DNS is down, they
think they can't get out at all.

Only when required by law. It costs about $70 a foot to bury cable in
the Portland metro area. It costs about $10~30 a foot to do aerial
attachments. 

One of the best aerial fiber examples is the fiber that is run in armor
at the tops of high voltage transmission lines.

If you want to look for fiber on a pole around town, look for the horse
shoes. Single mode fiber has a minimum bend radius, to put loops in the
aerial cable,  you need this if you have a fiber break so you can just
let the loop out for the repair, you have to control the bend in the
fiber as the cable loops back on itself.  This means that horse shoes
will be installed  The horse shoes are about a foot wide and two feet 
long usually with a crossbar for attachment and mechanical support, in
the middle of the loop. Think old style snow shoe / tennis rack / horse
shoe..

Underground fiber cables also have loops, but these are stored in vaults
under the streets, think a six foot deep by four foot by four foot wide
concrete box with a manhole at the top.. At one point all the fiber
loops in Portland for ELI went through a single manhole / vault in a
street in downtown Portland. The risk was so great that ELI filled the
vault with fire block I think this was prompted by a garbage truck
breaking down and catching fire a block away, I think the truck melted
into the street before it was put out. 

Thank you

I never got Yum to consistently work until I changed sources.

This is *so* true.

I will add, however, that Mr. Schieberl's own argumentation invites a
certain level of biographic investigation:

  I'm the biggest geek I know, and I don't have to waste time
  configuring my system from a command line to prove it.

As others have made clear, his social circle isn't terribly large if
he's the "biggest geek" he knows (unless, perhaps, "biggest" refers to
physical size, but I doubt that :-).

Um... because it has nothing to do with the issue at hand.  Didn't you
learn anything from Cliff Wells?

Get a nice book on rhetoric and look up "ad hominem".

This may have been prompted by a different event.

When I was at ELI (three years in data engineering developing network
management systems), we had a major fiber break in Eugene when that car
lot caught fire... the overhead fiber melted for, like 50 feet in each
direction.

Boyo, that was a mess.  And you should have seen the alarm storm.

Which is why I brought it up.  He's not a geek, and it's insulting to
those of us who are for him to make such a claim.

In which I'll have to go track down an old friend from Stream.  Rob,
the self described "incredible folding fat fsck."  When he was my
roommate, he came up with a unit of measurement known as the RBU (you
can probably guess the expansion), which is about 1.5 times the width
of your standard couch cusion, and roughly as deep, or roughly two
thirds the front bench in a 1983 Buick Skylark.  When he got into the
Buick we shared too fast, the side he got in on would momentarily
bottom out (and the suspension wasn't shot), and the car wouldn't
fully lift back up on that side until after he got out.

  For a lot of data, yes. In the environmental world, "POTS" is a
Publicly-Owned Treatment System. In other words, a sewage processing plant.
And that's where a lot of environmental data belong.

  FWIW, I sent a 1,019-word response yesterday and Marc Zusman, the WW
editor, asked me to cut it down to 250 words for publication. I got it down
to 263 words so I'm sure there will be room for more letters in response.

  D'accord. The reason Galen pointed this out in the first place is the
impression such a letter could leave with the general public. It is
important to refute his claims factually and verifiably. Unfortunately, it
is the last written word that someone reads that remains in memory. We want
that last word to be linux positive.

  I found this quote from Schieberl's letter to be the most telling:

"Most people use their computers for business, Web browsing, email and
printing pictures in a thought-free environment."

  The two points I see here are: 1) the co-mingling of business ("business"
and "email") and personal ("Web browsing" and "printing pictures") use and
2) the very Microsoft-centric and all-too-true "thought-free environment".

  Anyone who would write that "most people use their computers ... in a
thought-free environment" would fail in a non-Microsoft world. That's why we
have open relays, virus infected systems and grey hairs on network
administrators.

Hopefully the edit won't be too bad, since 13 words is roughly a
sentence or two.

I think they should just take 13 words out at random.

Yes. There's a box that splits into up to 24 channels. You can designate
from one to all 24 anything you want with the right settings. It's
programmed like a router, but I can't remember the name of the box.

I'll never forget the customer that had 2/24 set for data the rest for
voice. The management was astounded at how fast their T1 was, but didn't
know that they were using less than a tenth of it for data, the rest for
voice.

This is definitely more suited for plug-talk, but I really don't see why,
if they're pressed for space, they don't do things like that.  Seems
pretty easy to write an algorithm that removed letters while still
preventing ambiguous cases.

(Now, what percentage of those would be immediately recognizable to humans
is another story.)

What I don't know about T1s and data communications far exceeds what I 
know but I'll answer this question since we have this in the office I 
work in to a limited extent. We have a single T1 and have it 
provisioned such that 1/2 of the line is our ISP data connection and 
the other half is used for our phones.

We have a battery backed up box mounted in the closest with our PBX that 
is called a channel bank. It connects to our PBX and then it also has 4 
POTS lines coming out of it that are connected directly to the 
punch-down panel in the telco closet. The channel bank also has a 
router card in it that we connect to our firewall's WAN port with a 
crossover cable.

So yes it is possible to get POTS lines out of a T1 with the right 
equipment and provisioning in place.

The "oh" in Order is correct. I actually changed it to "o" and "0" then
back again just to make sure. 

The access module is there and I guess intact.

That is actually one of the first things I tried, but got different
errors like... Invalid command '<Directory>'  Upon looking at other
apache configs, they are all like what is listed above.

But if they support both + and - recording strategies, why are they
called dvd+rw-tools? A. 	For historical/nostalgical reasons, as
originally they did support exclusively DVD+plus. On the other hand now,
when the vast majority of DVD burners that are being introduced to the
market today are DVD+capable, the name most likely refers to your unit
in either case. And you can always consider the plus in the name as
notion of some unique quality, such as "seamless" multi-sessioning, not
as reference to some particular format:-)

http://www.k3b.org/
DVD burning:
    * Support for DVD-R(W) and DVD+R(W)
    * Creating data DVD projects
    * Creating eMovix DVDs
    * Formatting DVD-RWs and DVD+RWs


http://www.xcdroast.org/
# Note about DVD+R/RW support:
cdrecord.ProDVD requires in some cases the command-line option "-force"
to write on DVD+R/RW media. If this option is missing you get the
irritating message: "Cannot write CD's >= 100 minutes". As X-CD-Roast
does not yet support the -force option, you have to wait for a new
version, or use the command line manually.

While I understand the urge to view SS as a shill and to investigate
him, I think it is much more effective to debate his argument.  The
validity of most of his arguments is independent of his skills, or
geekiness.  Finally I agree that the best thing to do is ignore him.

While I don't argue this point, that part of his letter was the kind of
throw away line we are often tempted to add to our missives.  It have
very little to do with the basic argument and should not be elevated to
the center of the debate.  It is more of a taunt, than an argument.

Thank You Russel,
Yes, this is the type of information I was looking for. Something that
gave both pro and con to a product.

I've noticed in the ads for the Suse 9 that it has a DVD, is that
needed for the install?

Also, since this isn't my First distro and I'm looking for something
to go as a serverware for a SOHO setup, if you don't mind expounding
for my benefit, how does Suse stack up and what might you use instead?

For background, I've been playing wit RedHat since version 5 and
although I'm no novice, I'm still not as knowledgable as I'd like.
If time and money were not so tight right now, I'd be in several of
Ed's classes learning what PCC should have been teaching me over the
last three years.

Thank you for your time and considerable help with this.

I use google.  When I need to do something at the command line, I google
for it... what I'm looking for is an example of somebody doing something
similar to what I'm trying to do... so I can extrapolate it to what I am
doing.  When man pages have good examples, I never get past them.  Yeah,
man pages can get ugly, and I agree when you're trying to figure out how
to do something without knowing the program already, man pages feel very
complex.

Usually, somebody has posted on use-net or the web how to do something
close to what I'm trying to do, though, so I just use their example to
get a basic grasp on the program's arguments and run with it, with aid
from the man pages.  :-)

You left out two important ones: howto's and google.

Instead of spiral notebooks, which I use only for very short term
notes (because I'll never find them again), I have a logbook mode set
up in Emacs, which date-stamps an entry in a date-named file.  M-x
add-logbook-entry, is what I call it (I hacked 159 lines of
add-log.el).  Then I type whatever notes I have in there, about what I
ultimately figured out that works.  Then, when I want to find it
again, I just grep the logbook directory.

Well, that's why there's frontends like k3b, xcdroast and CD Bake
Oven.  They deal with cdrecord so you don't have to.

But the comment about the man-pages...I learned Linux from those.  I
don't see what the big deal is.  Granted, I'm coming from the
perspective of learning DOS from the DOS 3.3 manual when I was 8.  But
still, if an 8-year-old could handle worse documentation than a man
page and come out on top, surely someone with a high school or college
education can handle it readily.

Hi,

Whenever I do something of any complexity, it goes into a text file, a sort
of ongoing cheat sheet.  It's a brief reminder of the steps, links, config
files, command line options, etc. to do it again. Ex. apache with virtual
domains, NAT with iptables, installing Postfix, required info in DNS,
common ways of calling rpm, etc.  Great for those senior moments where I
don't want to reread the entire HowTo again.

Cheers,
Mike

1) For programs I use infrequently that have complex options, once I
get the program figured out I commit what I've learned to a script. The
script contains the switches for the options I always want to use, and
maybe some comments for the some of the other options. I always
include a "$*" parameter so I can pass in extra parameters.

2) If you can't get what you need from the man pages don't forget to
check the package documentation under /usr/share/doc. For some
packages (like cdrecord) this doesn't get you much. But for others you
may find lots of good stuff.

3) Google.

4) Ultimately you may have to address the problem the open source
way. That is, improve the documentation yourself and then contribute it
back to the project in hopes that it will be included in future releases.
This is better than writing your own documents and just hanging on to
them, because if you get them included with the project's files then
they are more likely to be kept up to date.

The DVD has the contents of the several CDs.  Use the CDs or the DVD.  If
you have the bandwidth, you can do a "free" ftp install but there are no
downloadable ISOs for Suse 9 on x86.

Red Hat isn't going where I want to be, Fedora is uncertain so Suse appears
to be the best bet for business.  Hopefully, Novell, with more commercial
software experience than any of the other Linux vendors, will get it right
this time.

I've started to use a personal wiki to keep information I've found 
useful.. it's still in a pre "critical mass" stage, so it's not my first 
thought whenever I wonder "how did I do that in the past?", but I think 
it might be at some point.

  This is what I did with my understanding (finally!) how to add Greek
letters and mathematical symbols to figures drawn with tgif. The author's
instructions were rather obtuse to me, so when I finally figured it out I
wrote the process as a series of 3 or 4 steps. Then I sent it to the author.
He added it to the appropriate Web page.

  Now, if I should ever forget, there's a readily available source for me to
access. :-)

I second the wiki idea.  As long as your web server stays up it's easily
reachable from any machine, wikis have built in full text search so you
don't have to remember what you named the file, and when you do this in
a work setting you can repsond to repeated questions by pointing people
to the wiki page.  If they find it lacking it is easy to update with
a clarification.  

Personal wikis are by far the most flexible and easy to use personal 
documentation I've found.

I have a customer that's a counter strike player. I do not know much
about the game except that it's a major security leak. 

Every time he logs into a steam server he gets bombarded, real time,
with viruses.

Is there a way to play this game without the open ports?

I haven't used any service like this, but no-ip.com also provides this

I don't fully understand... how is he bombarded with the viruses?  To an
email address?  AFAIK, the server an client apps don't need email
addresses anywhere.

What ports are you having to open?  IP_CONNTRACK does it all for me,
it's plain old UDP stuff as far as the game itself is concerned.

Do you save any sort of notes of what you've figured out?  I have a
spiral notebook(actually many) where I figured out how to use mkisofs
and cdrecord. I  go back to these pages everytime.

Re Google, it seems to me that Google is not as accurate as it used to
be.

An example.  Suppose you wanted to find out about
  a) cdrecord, would that be your google entry, would you restrict the
search to  a site?
  b) I'm interested in understanding Linux/Unix better.  So when LC_ALL
came up, it turned out that there was a _whole_ bunch of stuff, i18n,
etc. about locales, sorting, that I knew nothing about.

Search for a how-to on the linux search:
Goto <URL: http://www.google.com/linux >
enter into the search box:  cdrecord how-to

And let it fly.

You were dealing with something for which you had no point of reference.
It's rare, but sometimes you come across something about which you know
nothing and you have to do a bit of reading in order to know what you're
trying to ask.

Don't be hasty and make decisions before you understand.  Take the time
and do it right and next time you come across anything like that you'll
have the understanding to ask the right questions.

That's cool.  Sort of a text representation of your knowledge as it

If it is something I might need again and something I don't think I'd be
able to easily google again, I'll put it in a text file in my home
directory... sometimes I grep -R my home directory to remember such
things.  Generally, though, I just use google.

I think google is as accurate as ever... although with the abundance of
information out there, growing daily, it can sometimes be difficult to
find exactly what you're looking for.  If I want to just "find out about
cdrecord" I will read the CD Writing Howto and glance through the
documentation on the cdrecord website.  I rarely wish to read about such
generic things.  I want to know how to use cdrecord to blank and write
to a CD-RW out of a pipe from mkisofs or something like that.

On the LC_ALL thing; you must learn to refine your searches.  Give as
many keywords as possible you know will match up with what you're
looking for.  If that is too narrow, cut out a few keywords.  If it's
too broad, add a few more in there you think might work.

Google, I think, is where it is at.  :-)

Erm, actually this isn't entirely correct.  There are downloadable 
CDs, but usually via Bit Torrent.  SUSE (note The New Improved 
Capitalization(tm)) does not provide such downloads.  Others do.  
After the post on the PLUG list noting that SUSE says that copied CDs 
are legal as long as they are not sold (i.e. no money changes hands), 
I downloaded my own copy.  I'll buy another version of SUSE when my 
funding situation gets better.  I prefer to support them when I can.

I've used SUSE for years.  While there are things I'd like to have 
changed, overall, it just works.  On all my systems (P-II, P4, laptop 
w/P-III), it has just installed and worked without any hand holding 
or tweaking.  

I like SUSE's tweaking of KDE better than the stock KDE too.  They've 
got some nice little things set up in 9 like firing off k3b when I 
put in a blank CD-R etc.  I've added apt for RPM to my system and was 
able to get a lot more multimedia stuff working that way.

I don't see Fedora as uncertain.  I see its direction as uncertain.  I 
wish that RH would let it go free and become something like Debian, 
but with RPM instead of .deb.

Who knows what Novell and IBM are going to do with SUSE.  They want a 
widely popular distro, so I doubt that they'll do anything really 
weird.  I'm hoping they will see a popular "personal" distro as a 
requirement for a popular enterprize distro.  RH lost a lot of my 
trust when they decided to stop spending much money on the base 
distro.

I've been playing with Knoppix/Morphix/Mepis lately.  Very 
interesting.  They come a long way toward making me interested in 
Debian again.  I really don't want to constantly spend time getting 
things to work and that has usually driven me toward commercial 
distros.  You might consider Mepis.  It has great hardware detection 
and has the ability to install itself to the harddrive.  So do the 
other two, but when "cp -a" is the core of the installer, I lose a 
little faith :-) Knoppix makes an amazing rescue disk.  I keep a copy 
handy near my machines.

Best,
Kyle

FWIW, people studying to become Reference Librarians take whole
classes in what's called "the reference interview", which is basically
a dialog for extracting from the library user just what exactly they
are looking for.  This is necessary because many library users do not
start with well-formed questions, where "well-formed" implies
"aligned/matched with information resources available".  

Another frequent problem is that people come in to the library with a
mistaken or "limited" impression of what is available.  The
librarian's job is to back them up and find out what they are really
looking for so as to direct them to the best (or at least "better")
source.  My wife just gave me this example: a person comes in and asks
"where are the almanacs?".  Turns out they are looking for the GDP of
Japan for the last 10 years, and this is available more conveniently
in the International Financial Statistics Yearbook.

Of course, in the context of Linux/Unix problems there are no
reference librarians standing by.

The issue with man pages is the fact that they aren't books or even a
chapter. A book is to be read front to back in our culture. This
defines a logical flow of the ideas presented. The second chapter builds
on the first and so on.

For older individuals, I put myself in this category at 40, learning
from hypertext, man pages, or info pages requires a person to forget how
they have learned in the past. There isn't a progression of ideas in
these models, it is snap learning. You look for what you need right now
and gloss over what you don't know. I assume after you've done enough
of these exercises, you develop the big picture and concepts. Maybe this
is closer to real world learning, learning from an experience while the
experience is happening. 

This has nothing to do with intelligence or education level. It will be
interesting to see what happens to society when the new generations will
learn this is the way to learn, bookless learning, and the lessons are
written by people taught, and have internalized, from the man page
metaphor.

I hate being a dinosaur.

Thank you
Russell

Yes.

T-1 lines are composed of 24 distinct 64kbits/s channels (plus a few
overhead bits used for framing, signaling, etc.).  Each channel is
capable of replacing one standard voice circuit.

You will need to decide how many of these channels you wish to dedicate
to voice traffic and how many are allocated to data.  From the end-user
perspective, the data channels are generally "bonded" together into one
combined channel.  (Although I used to have a T-1 which was all data,
but busted into 3 separate data channels -- 12 channels to corp. HQ, and
6 channels each to smaller corporate satellites.)

Once you have decided on how many channels you need, you will probably
need to purchase a device which performs the following functions:

  1) Splits the incoming T-1 signal into it's voice and data streams.

  2) Presents the data stream in a form which is acceptable to your
     router (often using the V.35 serial protocol).  I've generally
     heard the term "data service unit" applied to boxes which perform
     this function.  (See http://www.kentrox.com/products/family_dsu/index2.asp).

  3) Presents the voice stream in a form which is acceptable to your
     phone system.  You may need to purchase a digital interface card
     for your phone system, or pickup up a "channel banks" which will
     do the analog-to-digital conversions necessary to make each of the
     individual digital voice lines appears as a standard analog line
     at your site.

I've been away from this industry for a few years, and the transport
methods and equipment have been changing quickly.  Talk to your provider
and keep asking questions of other knowledgable folks.  The short
answer to your question is a resounding "yes".

The real question, and one with many answers, is "How?".  :-)
This will involve the messy world of telecommunication standards (not
to mention local office politics and finance).

How much does it cost to run copper?  Is the $70/foot mostly tax?
If fiber can be run aerially, have any communities considered setting
up their own and if so what's the permit process like to do that?
Fiber is fast, then again WiFi is probably a better choice
for a block network.

How does fiber optic cable take water, sun, and wind?

Message-ID: <1076882229.23609.80.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I've been trying to troubleshoot LTSP 3.  I have a gray screen with
large X cursor but none of the tips seem to be correct.  Specifically
I keep getting an error that the server is already open after which
there's a going to sleep for 30 seconds message.  How does gdm know
which servers are running?  Is it okay under Valhalla to uninstall
fvwm, twm, and xdm packages or will this break gdm because of redhat's
stringy dependencies?  Are there any files under /etc/X11
in Valhalla that can be dumped, it's hard to troubleshoot when
there are extra files, Redhat is notorious for this.

Why does Redhat impose an arbitrary hierarchy of window managers
anyways?  For many reasons it doesn't always make sense to run
a gnome or kde session where I'm wondering if anyone has replaced
the prefdm script that's normally called from init?

Strangely I can get VNC to work, guess a window manager doesn't
have to be started for that.

There was something about a possibility that the XDMCP port is
bound to a dead process causing the gray screen, how does
one check this?  I've tried killing all gdm processes, removing
the .X*-lock files under /tmp, and all gdm and X related 
files under /home, /tmp, /var/gdm, and /var/log.  I've even
brought up an LTSP terminal in runlevel 3 thinking I need to 
remove the lock on the terminal.  Is there a well done gnome 
replacement for Redhat's that installs to Valhalla?

I'm not sure what changed, LTSP used to work.  It's probably something
simple.

BTW: Is it normal for ltsp in runlevel 3 to lack a resolver library,
     editor...  I think a lot of libraries are left out.

Message-ID: <1076882359.23610.87.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Doing file on lastlog on a working server I noticed it wasn't an ascii
text file.  I'm curios why catting some logs trashes the terminal.

Can all the logs be deleted?  If they are, how do you recreate new
empty ones?  If a log file is missing, do logs go to the 
screen by default?

Has anyone considered a smart cat, more, and less replacement that
will not open files that trash the terminal?

Is there a slick way to figure what is sending messages to the 
terminals and say have it put messages up on a terminal that's 
never used?  Many messages are so nondescript it's hard to tell 
where there coming from to correct the offending program.

Another thing peppering my logs is a keyboard timeout error.  I'm not
using an AT keyboard on my server.  USB is far more convenient at the
moment, it's what I have.  I still have a PS/2 mouse on one box though.
Why is the kernel probing for a PS/2 keyboard?  Is there a way to stop
this behavior?  On some computers I've noticed, like my P4, USB keyboard
doesn't work during post no matter what settings I try.  Do I need to
compile without PS/2 support or is that mice only?

Do you really WANT load balancing?  I mean, DHCP isn't exactly a great
load for any system.

All you really need is failover.

I want the workstations to use the router that is least congested out
of all the possibilities given.  It's ridiculous to have two routers
running all the time and only use the second one when the first one
fails.

Does failover work for static assignments?  The other thing is that I
don't want to add dhcp to a gateway or add a fourth server.

That would be about 21 or so for most people physically...  Mental
growth isn't the only type of growth either where the brain breaks
down in old age and holds onto only what it can and what is 
most important. Humility is needed for tech support work.

Fear of old age is fear of God or what?  Then again, why be afraid
if there are some 90 year olds that are sharp as tacks smart.
The world's at an end, I'm 22!  Oh wait, that's not true!

Society needs technology professionals who focus on bringing
people up to speed over pumping up their egos with 
questionable knowledge gains, not that that isn't fun ;-)

What is T1 technology compared to ISDN compared to ADSL, G-Lite?

Are these all copper pair, phoneline, technologies?  Is there special
wiring for ISDN and TI involving different gauges of copper wire
than what standard telephone lines use?  Is it just the frequencies
used? 

How does ISDN compare to T1?  Where do OC3 or DS3 lines fit into
this?  How about Sprint's transcontinental fiber lines that carry
over a terabit per second of data per line?

I've read that ISDN failed because telcos couldn't roll it out for
whatever reason and that DSL is a substitute.

Has anyone heard of 45 mbps DSL?  I thought I saw a white paper on
this.

I haven't run anything but Xfce since Red Hat 7.1, so "impose" strikes
me as the wrong verb. :-) You've got a couple choices:

1. Just put what you want in ~/.Xclients, e.g.,

  #!/bin/bash
  /usr/bin/startxfce4

2. If you're running gdm (Red Hat's default display manager), then the
   files in /etc/X11/gdm will be of interest to you. The Sessions
   directory, in particular, is where you can add choices. Change the
   Default file to whatever you'd like.

From: Michael Trigoboff <mltsoftware at comcast.net>

I sent this out to my classes at PCC yesterday:
-----------------------------------------------

On Thursday, a student of mine asked me about software job prospects.
Yesterday I heard a presentation by local software industry expert (and old
friend of mine) Pete Mackie. Here's my understanding of what Pete had to
say:

Coding jobs are being outsourced overseas. There are plenty of places (e.g.
India, Russia, China, Rumania, Klingon) where smart people are willing to
write code for as little as one-ninth of what you would currently earn here
in the USA. It's not a smart move any more for you to pursue a job that
consists strictly of writing code. Those jobs are not likely to continue to
exist here in large numbers in the long term (or if they do, the salaries
will be significantly lower than they are now).

Outsourcing currently has problems. Many companies that try software
outsourcing have bad experiences. But the economic incentives are so great
that companies have a large motivation to keep trying and they will
eventually get it right. This means that a number of coding jobs will
continue to be available locally, but that may be a short-term proposition.

What will continue to be needed here in the USA, and will earn you decent
$$$, is the ability to manage the offshore coders. To manage a remote
project like this, you need to be a good programmer. You need to be able to
understand a software project, and have a good idea how long it would take
to implement. You need good communication skills. You need to be able to
evaluate what the offshore team tells you. Are they communicating accurately
with you?  Are they reliable?  Do they know what they're doing?  You need to
be able to evaluate the status of a project, the quality of the code, how
closely they are following the job specification, and whether they're going
to meet the project schedule.

Speaking of the job specification, you need to be able to read one and tell
whether or not it makes sense. You might be the one who writes that spec.
You need the ability to understand the business you're working for, analyze
their software needs, and come up with a sensible project proposal.

You need good interpersonal skills, good writing skills, good management
skills, and good programming skills. If you have this skill set and pursue
the kind of job described above, you will be well-positioned for a promising
career in the software industry.

I want to add one cautionary note: Opinion on this topic is not totally
unanimous at the moment. You would be well-advised to continue to pay
attention and adjust your plans as the situation changes. The high-tech
world is moving very quickly these days. You need to be alert.

Bill,

  I just sent to a friend of mine a great book that provides the best
overview of linux I've read, "Linux A-Z". Another book that I found _very_
helpful is Marcel Gagne's, "Linux System Administration". I had read other
linux/UNIX sysadmin books but his writing style and topic selection has been
of great use to me.

  One possibility is to go down to Powell's Technical Books and look over
the distribution-agnostic, general linux SysAdmin books. You'll find the one
you like the best and makes the most sense to you.

Banal, but true.
You might consider whether or not you need to learn some  manners, or
start learning them.   When you stop learning politeness, you tempt
others to stop your living(just kidding, no theat intended).

Wew!  A lot of questions.  Here is my best shot.
(You real telco guys please chime in and fix my misteakes, eh?)

There are at least two different flavors of ISDN -- BRI (Basic Rate
Interface) and PRI (Primary Rate Interface).

              B-chan         D-chan
             --------  -----------------
      BRI        2        1 @ 16 kbits/s
      PRI       23        1 @ 64 kbits/s

The "B" (bearer) channels are 64 kbits/s each are used to carry the
desired subscriber information.  The "D" channel is a signalling
channel used (primarily) to communicate with the ISDN switch at the
telco office.  It can be used to communicate information about each
of the B channel status such as "on-hook", "off-hook", "ringing" ...

I've also seen SOHO solutions which used a single BRI-ISDN configuration
to do:  voice line (first B channel), FAX line (second B channel), and
credit card verification off of a slow (~9600 baud) serial link setup
through the D-channel.  (You'd have to find an ISDN guru to assist with
*that* setup though.)


The next two tables are from "The Guide to T-1 Networking" by William
A. Flanagan.  It is a text which has been used on local community college
courses on telecommunications.

(IIRC it was a bit spendy, but can probably be found in a local library
or possibly as a used book for a reasonable price.)


The North American digital heirarchy:

                         Digital     Equivalent
                        Bit Rate     Voice Circuits

        DS2            6.312 Mbps          96
        DS3 / T-3     44.736 Mbps         672

          E-5        565.148 Mbps        7680


Unless you work in telecomm, probably the only ones you'll ever have
to deal with are the DSO, DS1/T1, and DS3/T3 lines.

The above heirarchies are for "copper wire" transport.  The "OC"
heirachy is for optical networks.  For that, you can follow this
link:
       http://www.linktionary.com/o/oc.html

As you can see, pretty much every telco rate gets reference to the
number of voice circuits it can support.

I suspect the Sprint backbone links you are referring to use an
optical transmission technique which utilizes muliple wavelengths
of light (multiple "colors") on a single optical fiber.  One
specific technology is dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM).
Here's a product which claims to support over 2 Tbps links
       http://www.ciena.com/products/corestream/corestream.htm


> I've read that ISDN failed because telcos couldn't roll it out for

That was part of the problem -- here are a couple more ....

(1) Somehow, ISDN just wound up being too complex.  One piece of
     information you needed to configure an ISDN modem was the
     type of switch at the telco central office (CO)!

(2) What has been generally conceded as the largest problem is
     economics.  When provisioning systems, and creating business
     models, telco company analysts were pretty much stuck in the
     "user picks up phone, dials, converses, and hangs up" world.

     So they could assume that n "ports" on a CO switch could
     support N lines (where n is significantly less than N).
     Switch ports are expensive.

     The problem ... this thing called the Internet.  People would
     dial in, and never get off the line!  (Local telecommuters
     did likewise, too.  I was definately guilty of keeping my
     ISDN connection to work up for hours, if not days, at a time.)

     The beauty of DSL, from a provisioning standpoint, is that
     it allows the carrier to split the DSL signal off.  The DSL
     signal is routed into a separate piece of equipment (a DSLAM
     -- digital subscriber line access multiplexor).  This means
     the same old AT&T ESS-5 switch can continue to manage voice
     traffic without having to go through extensive upgrades.

Nope ... but maybe Google has.  :-)

People want better quality and despite the Internet, I find it hard
to believe that there's no room for doing the software engineering
here.  I also think Mackie is discounting the room for competition.

For some of these countries that are being outsourced to, they aren't
paid enough to take jobs from us so the public should consider more 
than cost in software acquisitions.  My greatest concern is, is the
education on how to program moving overseas as well?  It's no secret
that places like Southern Africa rank better in math and science,
etc.  An economic system where it's cheaper for someone else to
do the thinking and production doesn't make any sense to me at 
all.

By coding jobs does that mean copying jobs, or are these overseas people
actually designing the programs?

That supports fewer people than doing the coding here did.  At PSU there
wasn't much of a resource center I knew of to aid in the process of
evaluating coding methods, etc.  The programming assignments in cs202
were extremely hard and didn't make any sense.  It was not possible
in Karla's class to ask her questions for clarification and she didn't
teach us methods to decide what a project statement means on our own. 
Where's the career counseling?  If computer science is a painful dead 
end, why isn't more help offered to students to redirect their
efforts elsewhere?

Why doesn't PCC help people who want to become professional programmers
in Linux environments more?  If we're talking about cost, you have to
get out of Microsoft software, yet there isn't anything for Linux
compared to what their is for Microsoft at PCC.

Outsourcing makes us intellectual slaves to foreign countries.  This is
dangerous and in the long run neither good for us nor for the country
we depend on if it comes to see us as a burden.  If anything, I would
think being equals is better for foreign relations.
 
What does not profitable mean?  After all, I don't think most people
feel computer science isn't worth it if they can't make as much as Gates
did.  I'm willing to program for a living wage, or $30-40k a year.  Is
that too much money to ask for?  It's better to earn that for ten+ 
years than a lot over a very short period, a quality of life issue
really.

If you have to have a Ph.d. to make it in computer science, there's no
reason to be in computer science unless a lot of the people out there
now start to retire.

the simple fact is, the world is too large for one person to look
at.  it takes obsessive attention to keep up with new
developments in any field of human endeavor.  computers are a
huge field, and frankly not very interesting.  I never paid much
attention to computers in the first place (I'm more of a compsci
geek than a computer geek), and these days I often resent the
amount of effort it takes to simply "stay current" in the narrow
specialty I'm working in right now ("the unix world").  there are
many things I'd rather be doing instead, and many of them have
little to do with computers.

someone using the phrase "back in my day" is probably joking.
it's a lighthearted acknowledgement that the world is changing
faster than anyone can keep up with, which makes everyone an
ignorant fool from time to time.  this is not a new observation,
it's been that way for longer than I've been alive.

There are a number of protocols to route over multiple links: BGP, OSPF,
and RIP for example. You'll find these in the zebra or quagga packages.
(http://www.quagga.net, http://www.zebra.org)

Unless you are running a big network, this is not something you will
be able to do. Try calling up your ISP and tell them that you want to
run BGP ;-)


If you are using NAT on your routers, you might be able to come up
with some sort of crude, home-brewed load balancing scheme. With
sufficiently complex iptables/iproute rules, you could do something
like force all HTTP traffic down one pipe, FTP down another...

telco company analysts are pretty much stuck in the  "user picks
up phone, dials 911 , converses, and hangs up" and help arrives.

It is a pretty neat trick, that. My sister burnt out part of her brain
because we were in a region of the world where this wasn't available.
You might think about your children if you have some, or your parents if
you're older. My mother's aunt fell over Christmas and broke her hip.
She had to crawl into the kitchen to get to her phone. The one in the
living room was a cordless and she couldn't get to it. Took her a couple
of hours. Can you imagine a 94 year old woman with a broken bone making
that trip. I hope I'm that tough when I'm that old, well if I get that
old. 


Thank you

I want to see if I figure out why XDMCP is bombing though... 
Even if I want to do a configuration other than Redhat's 
I need to know how to uninstall Redhat's stuff from the 
scripts, etc. 

Contents of: /etc/X11/gdm 

[michael at goose gdm]$ ls -R 
.: 
factory-gdm.conf  gnomerc  locale.alias  PreSession  XKeepsCrashing 
gdm.conf          Init     PostSession   Sessions 

./Init: 
Default 

./PostSession: 
Default 

./PreSession: 
Default 

./Sessions: 
default  Default  Failsafe  Gnome 

My gdm.conf is attached... 

Also attached are xdm-config, Xaccess, Xsession, and Xsetup_workstation
from /etc/X11/xdm. 

The prefdm script under /etc/X11 called from inittab is included. 

The file ls-lR-rc_d is a text file listing of my rc.d directory, it's in
the etc_include.tar.gz file with the server's inittab file. 

This covers all the files that ltsp_initialize covers except of course
the ltsp.gif file, that's just a picture after all...

Troubleshooting attempt:

I tried the troubleshooting on www.ltsp.org, that's not getting
to what's causing this.  This used to work by the way.

Subject: [PLUG] rpm uses LD_LIBRARY_PATH?
Message-ID: <BAY9-F26sD1Ty9CMdZp00010824@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I am using Fedora core 1.

I am trying to install a tool via rpm
and it complains missing a bunch of .so libraries, which I can see
them all under a particular directory.

So I add that directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  So get the same complain
from rpm.

Does RPM even looks at LD_LIBRARY_PATH for shared object libraries?
If not, is there another env variable I need to define?

thanks for any pointer.

--Vincent

Ah yes.  Tech support.  The fine art of telling someone they're a

I doubt very much that rpm would look at LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

What directory are these libraries in? Is the directory listed in
/etc/ld.so.conf? If not then add the directory to that file and
then run 'ldconfig'.

Ahem.

ld-linux.so actually looks at LD_LIBRARY_PATH. And you'll notice that
every single elf binary on your system is linked with this. ;-) So,
rpm has no choice, actually.



(Not that I have anything else to contribute to this thread.)

Well the problem is that the rpm you are installing requires a "file".

RPM is trying to find that "file" in its own database, and I *think*
places to look.

So I do not think that RPM used LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Often if you look, the file is not in /etc/ld.so.conf, or that there is
a lib change between the binaries you are installing and the libs on the
system.

I've had that a few time recently when projects decide to update their
major numbers.  It can foobar a number of things.

Use google for the error message.

So?  That's normal when you hit the end of any data stream
successfully.

inetd isn't a time server.

I use Gentoo for my desktop, test box, and I am going to migrate my
web/mailserver over from RH to Gentoo. I think its a great distro and the
emerge package system works very well. Its great if you want to build a system
without all the execess baggage you get in RH, Suse, et al.

What is the easiest way to start???

Looking at the site.. There are two install CD's and a live CD.

Is one way better then the other??  Easier/Harder

I watched NAV freak out and lock him out. It repaired 2 or 3 instances,
and then he was tossed for being unresponsive by the steam server. 

We did it a few times on different servers. 

I turned off NAV, we logged in and he played a few minutes. We logged
off and I turned on NAV, it found viruses and fixed them.

It turned out to be tcp wrappers.  It's not obvious to me
how to explicitly allow something xinetd calls an internal
service without taking the this whole subnet is okay 
approach. Pursuing all is denied except
that that is allowed, this is not a goof fix.
If I filter with iptables, aren't tcp wrappers 
redundant?  Trying rpm -qf as I usually do to track
down documentation on hosts.allow and hosts.deny, 
that didn't get me anywhere.

One concern I have is that having not migrated to Redhat 9
or something else more recent than 7.2 and 7.3, information
online that I need will disappear.  One think in particular
I've run into a lot is Linux Journal articles reachable via
google.  It would be nice to get electronic
copies of useful materials from when 7.x was still out
for my own offline use.  Maybe in the future what is
really needed is continuous low level training and
something like CVS to make my own private information
repositories on Linux easy to maintain and update.

This gets back to the personal documentation thread 
because the shreds nature of a lot of the information
I pick up online is a pain to deal with.  It's not 
exactly the most appealing help source to have to 
depend on.

The easiest way to get started is to download a gentoo liveCD image and burn
it.
This will contain pre-built packages. This will probably be the fastest
install. I've never done things that way though, so I can't enlighten you about
that road ahead.

You only need one cd, and I've found their LiveCD the easiest way to go. I use
a
gentoo liveCD I burned last year, and just pull everything down over the net.
As long as you have a dsl or cable connection everything goes pretty smoothly.
The only drawback to gentoo is the footprint. I think it needs a gig or so of
space. It might be the portage tree (the package management system), though I'm
not really sure why.

Anyway, I build the system from scratch, which is cool if you've never done it,
but will take a long time on older systems. I built my test box (PII 400mhz,
128mb ram) and it took three days to go from a blank slate to a system running
KDE 3.1. Mind you, KDE was the longest compile, about 30 hours or so.

Also, their forums are pretty good. If I get into trouble I usually just search
there and if I don't alredy find a thread, someone has always had an answer
pretty quick.

It seems from reading the docs that you only need more than one cd if your
going
to use pre-built packages of Gnome, KDE, Mozilla, etc. The initial liveCD will
contain a gentoo environment from which you can do the install.

Well, that was ten years ago.  I know plenty of people twice my age (and a
couple two and half times!) who are active participants in the modern
world and do not feel as though "their day" has passed.

Your day ends when you let it.

These days, there are lots of new and interesting options in the "soft
switch" world.  I've seen a Sun Ultra 10 that thought it was a DMS-500.

I think the price per port is going to drop through the floor quite soon.

Now, see, I totally understand and appreciate this.  If she'd said
something like, "I'm new to this" or "I haven't really used computers
before", I'd've been fine with it.

If that were the case, it would never be anyone's day.

We're all a bit behind in most fields of human endeavor and understanding
and way behind in some, but that doesn't mean we get to stop learning once
we reach puberty or even retirement.

Hmm?  I thought most inetd implementations supported both
the human-readable daytime (RFC-867; UDP and TCP ports 13)
and time (RFC-868/STD-26; UDP and TCP ports 37) protocols.

.... make sure the variable has been export'd to the environment.

     # LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/my_soft_dir

is insufficient

     # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/my_soft_dir

works much better.


I suspect that Zot may be right though.  RPM is looking for the
dependency in it's own database.  Try "--force" or "--nodep" ...

Sounds like he should be more careful about which servers he's using.
Hijacked server, perhaps?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0402160608470.15427@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I bought all the components for a system from ENU and they run just fine.
Until I try to add a second hard drive. I've exchanged the hard drive and
the cable but the new drive is still not recognized by the BIOS.

  Initially, the original hard drive was on IDE bus 0 and the CD-ROM drive
was on bus 1. When I bought the additional hard drive, I re-jumpered the
original drives and put them both on IDE bus 0 (hard drive as master, cd-rom
drive as slave). The original drive is a WD 60G model; the one I'm trying to
add is a WD 80G model.

  The new drive is on the second IDE bus. I tried both positions on the
cable; left the jumper off, placed it for master alone, placed it for cable
select and it is just not recognized.

  In my naivety, there are only three components involved: the hard drive,
the cable and the motherboard. I suppose that the replacement cable I tried
ia also bad, but in 20 years of building systems I've not seen problems with
new hardware and I've never had a bad cable. And, since the cdrom had been
on IDE bus 1 and was used to install Slackware-9.1 I must assume that the
system board is OK.

  I'm at a loss what to try. I'm thinking of hauling the box to my business
lunch and stopping at ENU on the way back to the office afterwards. But, if
someone here has some ideas, I'd really appreciate them. I would _really_
like to get this new drive working so I can complete the migration from the
old machine to the new one.

TIA,

Rich

That is, of course, unless the box was hacked and netstat was replaced
with a version that doesn't list this particular process...

I, personally, started from stage 1.  Start it on a Friday afternoon if
you can, and you should (assuming you have a reasonably powerful system)
have a fully functional system by Sunday evening, with X and (if you
want them) KDE and GNOME.

I really like Portage.

If you have multiple systems on your LAN running Linux capable of
compiling things... set up distcc.

Are you setting the jumpers correctly?  The drive on the end of the
cable should be the first drive, set to Master, the drive on the
middle connector should be the second drive, set to Slave.  If they're
both on their own cable, both should be set to Master.

What happens if you set the jumper for Master?  What happens when it is
the only drive in the box?  Could the power connection be bad?

I never jumper drives for Cable Select.  In my experience, it doesn't
work.  Jumper for Master if there is a slave present, jumper for slave
if it is the slave, or don't jumper it at all if it is alone, although I
usually leave them jumpered for Master in that situation, anyway.

Are they built in, though?

inetd provides simple access to servers... it lets the servers operate
on stdin and stdout.  AFAIK, it doesn't provide any services, itself...
that is simply not its job.

Are you saying that iptables is not reliable and another

It does. So yes, it is a time server. However, its accuracy
is plus or minus 1 second and its precision is to the second.
You'd use ntp for greater accuracy and precision.

Paul,

  First, my understanding is that the position on the cable matters only
when the drive is set for 'cable select', otherwise not.

  Second, yes I had the jumper set for single/master on both cable
connections and on cable select on both connectors. No life detected.

Thanks,

I think it's always a good idea to have a second access control
mechanism in place.... redundancy is good for security.  If one level
breaks down, there's a second level to hopefully hold back until
SysAdmin comes along and fixes the first level.

If we have such things, we set our car alarms after locking the car
doors.  Either one should be sufficient protection against intruders,
yet we use both.

In our homes, we usually lock all our doors and windows.  Many, if not
most, people also have some form of weapon near where they sleep... be
it a baseball bat, a shotgun, a rifle, or a little snubnose revolver. 
In case the first layer of protection fails.  :-)

This changed with the advent of ATA-66.  Now the position on the cable
*does* matter.

Again, I really never use cable select as I can't remember it ever
working for me.  I'm not sure if, since ATA/66 requires a special cable
and cable positions, it is compatible with cable select or not.

  I, too, have never used cable select. But, I've also not had a new drive
not been recognized by the BIOS before. So, I tried everything I could think
of to isolate the source of the problem.

  Guess it's back to ENU this afternoon.

I guess you pick your poison. I try to simplify my systems as
much as possible to minimize complexity. I wouldn't have redundant
functions that offer no benefit other than to protect against
human mistakes because the increased complexity may cause human
mistakes.

In the case of access control, mistakes can be detected early
with testing.

  The original cable was one of the new, round ones. That would probably
have been the correct type.

  Well, I'll ask the vendor to help me resolve the problem.

Generally, the way I do it is I flush iptables, do what I need to do,
then recheck what ports I need, then reset iptables.  Dual layers of
protection, just in case something prevents iptables from getting run.

I had to both set the jumpers correctly _AND_ put the drives in the 
"correct" position on the cable.  In my case the cable was actually 
labelled so this wasn't too much of a chore.  Still, it was a new 
thing to me.  I'm still not sure I did something wrong.

I put two drives on the primary chain and the CD as master on the 
secondary chain.  That seemed to make the BIOS happier than any other 
combination I tried.  Operator error is still a large possibility for 
me :-)

Best,
Kyle

This analogy doesn't work for me for a few reasons.

1.Automobile versus computer analogies almost never provide an
  apples to apples comparison. This one is such an example.

2.Car door locks and alarm systems have different functions. An
  alarm system does not protect against intruders in the same
  way that door locks do whereas iptables and TCP wrappers do
  perform (essentially) the same functionality.

3.You use an alarm system because you know the car door locks are
  not reliable. They can be defeated by relatively unskilled
  attackers. Iptables is far more reliable than car door locks
  and does not need to operate in tandem with duplicated
  functionality.

4.The operator of the vehicle can forget to lock the doors during
  normal operation. Once you give iptables a rule, it doesn't
  forget during normal operation.

Again, you're using examples of devices that have different
functionality. You use the weapons only after (and because)
the locks have failed.

Kyle,

  This was the first thing I tried.

> I put two drives on the primary chain and the CD as master on the
> secondary chain.  That seemed to make the BIOS happier than any other
> combination I tried.

  On all my prior systems, I'd put the hard drives on the first bus and the
cdrom on the second bus. Recently, I read that one speed optimization for
the comparatively slow speeds of EIDE drives was to put them on separate
buses. That way access to one would not be related to access of another.
Made sense to me, even though this new box is not a heavily-loaded or used
server. Regardless, it should work.

Sigh,

Rich

Well, we may have a communication mix up. Yes, the rpm binary itself
uses LD_LIBRARY_PATH. But it doesn't use LD_LIBRARY_PATH to verify
library dependencies of packages being installed. That's what I meant,
which is what I understood the original question to be.

WD is very weird about jumpers.

IIRC, two WD on the same channel will auto negotiate. A single WD on a
cable doesn't like any jumpers at all. A WD with something else needs
the jumper, most of the time. 

If I were you, I'd try unconventional things, like above, to see what I
can get going. I'd work one channel at a time. 

At the risk of being far too basic, and only because I hadn't seen it
listed here recently, I'll mention that many systems will not boot if
the pin 1 stripe is not oriented toward the power connector on the IDE
device.

Does the new drive recognize correctly under any circumstance?

CSFO is closing their doors, BTW. Should be this month some time.

Mike,

  I tried the new drive with no jumper.

  There is no way to easily miss this: the plugs have two, small ridges in
the center of one side; the socket has a notch in the center of one side.
Ridges go into notch. This is on both the drives and the system board.

> Does the new drive recognize correctly under any circumstance?

  Nope.

OK, door locks and ignition switch gives you two layers of protection
against starting the car.

I have seen this "not recognised" problem on systems where the BIOS has been

Try this, please.  It will at least tell us a little bit.  If it works
in a single drive setup, set up *exactly* as your known-good drive, then
it is simply a configuration error somewhere along the line.  If it does
*not* work, set up exactly as the known-good drive is set up, then we
can safely assume there is a hardware-level compatibility or failure
issue.

Ok, it is not recognized by the bios, but is it recognized by the linux kernel
during boot? This may be just a limitation of the bios that does
not concern you.

I only use WD drives now, and they work like every other brand I've
used in the past.  Master if it's the only or first drive, Slave if
it's not.  If it doesn't work like that, you might have a bad drive.

this is a false analogy because you're trying to apply
analog-world reasoning to the digital world.  in the analog world
you can analyze things in terms of percentage reliability.  "this
mechanism will work 99% of the time, and when that fails, this
backup mechanism will work 99% of the time, therefore the total
reliability is (1 - (.01 * .01)) = 99.99%".  that type of
reasoning works because failures are not systematic, they're just
a result of factors that are basically "random", and you can
treat the failures as independent events.

that doesn't work in the digital world, because anything in the
digital realm is perfectly reproducible (which is why people find
it useful), and it's pass/fail.  a security mechanism is 100%
reliable until a flaw is discovered, which makes it 0% reliable.

one hedge against the pass/fail problem is "the chance that
someone will try to target you in particular", which leads to
rules of thumb like, "don't make enemies", "keep a low profile",
"be a harder target than your neighbors", etc.  all those rules
are basically useless for computers, because of automated
attacks.

on the internet, it isn't that hard to send out self-replicating
programs that will search and attack anything that has a
particular flaw.  there isn't an equivalent in the analog world.
it isn't possible for me to create a butterfly that will a)
create more butterflies, b) spread across the world quickly, c)
disable all Lexus door locks.

another hedge against the pass/fail problem is "the chance that a
previously unknown flaw will be discovered".  and the best way to
reduce that chance is to keep the mechanisms simple and easy to
understand.  in the digital realm, having two locks is worse than
having one lock, because you have to divide your effort into
proving both locks are secure and proving that the combination of
the two is also secure.  the more effort it takes for you to do
an analysis of security, the greater the chance that there's a
flaw or a condition you overlooked.  it's better to concentrate
all your attention on just one simple lock, whenever you can.

Ah. Serves me right for skimming one message in the middle of dozens
of others. I'm sure, then, in that context that neither that, nor
ld.so.conf is supported. Specifically, I would "agree" in the sense
that any binary package manager presently available will only claim
that library dependencies are met by whether they themselves are
packaged and depended on by the package you want to install. If you
force, or if the package is poorly built, there's no guarantee the
installed package will work.

Without details, I'd suggest explicitly specifying the character set
of the data while inserting into the database. It looks like it has
guessed that you're trying to give it 32-bit Unicode, which very few
apps support.

I think things aren't as hard-and-fast as that.

The code is very complex.  I can assure you, there *are* some IPTables
vulnerabilities out there.  There *are* some SSH vulnerabilities out
there.  There *are* some Postfix/inn/whatever else vulnerabilities out
there.  We just aren't aware of them yet because they haven't been
discovered.

Does this mean Windows was 100% reliable up until the first security
flaw was discovered?  I think not.  I think the OS was insecure before,
we just didn't realize it.

I wouldn't call any piece of software 100% secure.  It defies logic that
something could be 100% reliably secure one moment, then completely
insecure the next moment simply because of one individual gaining
knowledge.

Spiral notebooks for jotting notes and info as I'm working on something.

Text files for summarizing these notes into something I hope to understand
several months from now.

Scripts if those notes distill down to a particularly nasty command line.
(mkisofs and cdrecord are two good ones.)

CVS to store the revisions I make to those files so I don't have to worry
about overwriting something that turns out to be important later on.

The greatest thing about text files are their compatibility.  Lots of
tools are available to read/search/convert/change them.  The worst thing
is the lack of any advanced formatting.  (Fortunately, since they are
notes to myself, they don't have to be pretty.)

The theory is sound, but then other issues intrude. The first is very few
single drives are capable of saturating even an ATA66 bus, let alone
ATA100 or ATA133 (okay last report is over a year old at this point); so
combining drives on a fast controller/cable likely won't hurt. A much
larger kink in this is that most CD and DVD readers and writers are at
best capable of handling ATA33. As a result keeping the hard disks
separate from each other, but combining one with an optical will likely
damage performance on that drive (many modern drives are capable of
saturating ATA33 and then some).

Both of these are very likely issues, or will provide information, try
them.

Though not deeply entwined in issues specific to Linux or flavors of
Unix, this is really off topic?

Can I specify the character set on a row-by-row basis?  It looks like
not.  In the corpus I am looking at, I see a wide variety of
content-type headers:

  text/plain; charset=us-ascii
  text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
  text/plain; charset=iso-8859-5
  text/plain; charset=iso-8859-7

etc.

One message in particular is labeled with iso-8859-1 and contains
"J?rg" in the body, the second character of which appears as 0xf6 in
the mbox file.

Which encoding should I use and how do I specify it?  I am a
Postgresql and DBD::Pg neophyte, if that isn't obvious already.

yes, it's never anyone's day.  young people think they're close
to knowing everything they need to know.  old people are not so
sure.  this is a gross generalization, of course.

I'm not saying I'm going to stop learning sometime, and I doubt
the woman you were talking to was saying that either.  "back in
my day" is kind of a shorthand way for people to set expectations
and defuse awkwardness.

if I say something like "back in my day, we didn't have graphing
calculators", it means I learned how to solve problems without
them, I haven't learned how to solve problems with them, it
hasn't seemed important yet to learn anything about them.  so if
you use a graphing calculator to show me something, what you do
might not make any sense to me, because the connection between
how you do things and how I do things might not be obvious, and
your idea of what's "simple" or "obvious" might be completely
different from mine, so you'll have to be patient with me.

this type of interpersonal interaction goes against a cultural
schema of "older = wiser", which could be awkward if I project a
message like "you're too young to explain anything to me" or you
project a message like "you should know this already" or other
such implicit messages.  fortunately, there's an opposite
cultural schema, "old dinosaur", which lets you relax in a role
of superior knowledge, and I don't mind being in the dinosaur
role for the purposes of this interaction.

there are certainly problems with following the dinosaur schema
too literally.  I could have said something like "talk to me like
I'm 6 years old", but that has its own set of problems.  so let's
assume we're both reasonable people and can get through this
awkward inequality without too much fuss.  and if I have to
consciously analyze all this and explain it in detail, then I'm
being condescending by not acknowledging your own awareness of
this situation we're in, so instead I've pulled out a
semi-automatic dinosaur cliche to get past this.

it's like flirting.

Ah.  Evidently, what I needed was to create the database with
something like:

  create database foo with encoding = 'SQL_ASCII';

Seems to have fixed it.

Sure there are. Most of us on this list comprise a sort of distributed
reference desk for Linux/Unix users. Of course, at our little reference
desk occasionally the librarians engage in all-out brawls, pulling hair
and hurling office equipment, while the patrons stand by quietly
gaping... But it usually works out pretty well in the end. :-)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0402161633090.19443-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I've been running it to this problem and don't have the financial 
resources to sort it out.  Hopefully someone here can point me in the 
rightdirection.

I've discovered that the personal firewalls' uplink port won't sync with
some CISCO 2900 and 3500 Enterprise switches.  Tried all the regular
tricks (cross-over cable, tested cables, etc.) but but the only way is to
go through a 'cheap' hub or switch then to the CISCO switch.

I think I can lay my hands on a new LinkSys DSL/Router but if anyone has a 
better idea I'm open.

BTW, the reason I'm doing this is so individual offices in a
building/complex are firewalled from each other (and the world) but using 
the same big pipe.

sorry, I was sloppy for the sake of simplicity.  the word
"reliable" is too vague to be useful in this case, and you're
using a different meaning of the word than I intended.

what I meant was something like, "what's the probability that
someone can penetrate your security barrier right now?"  it's
close to 0% if there are no exploits known by anyone.  it's 100%
if someone does know an exploit.  this doesn't sound like a very
useful statement, because it doesn't seem like some secretive
malicious agent would care about penetrating your security, but a
computer has value independent of it being _your_ computer, and
someone can want access to your computer without necessarily
knowing whose computer it is.  the chances of that are not small,
because it's easy to automate attacks, because computers are a
type of universal machine.

perhaps a more useful statement is

    the chance that a malicious agent has bypassed a network
    security mechanism on your computer before anyone has
    discovered any exploitable flaws in the mechanism is 0%.

    the chance that a malicious agent has bypassed a network
    security mechanism on your computer after someone has
    discovered an exploitable flaw in the mechanism approaches
    100% very quickly, because of automated attacks.

Rob,

  Still haven't yet tried this. But, I was told by the folks at ENU that
only the primary IDE bus on the MSI KT3 system board supports ultra-DMA, so
both drives need to be there.

  Took everything out and checked jumpers.

  Original hard drive on bus0, master (and jumped as such). New hard drive
on bus0, slave (and jumped as such). CD-ROM drive on bus1, master (and
jumped as that).

  Turn on the box and no drive is recognized. ARRRGGHH-H-H-H!

  I've not had this problem ever before.

  Later, perhaps tomorrow, I'll unplug the cdrom and the old drive, rejump
the new one as a master and see what it does on the end of the cable.

  No. Can't run cfdisk on it. The system board/BIOS are about 1.5 years old.
They should support drives of this size.

Rick,

  Are you referring to the BIOS settings for the drives? By default they are
on "auto". The original drive was recognized and so was the cdrom. When I
put the new drive on the system it all falls apart.

Subject: [PLUG] OT: Laptop screen backlight problem
Message-ID: <1076983927.12274.5.camel@timmy>

I just got my hands on an old IBM Thinkpad 600E. It has partnumber
2645-4AU.

For a few days, it was working quite well. It was slow, but working. But
now the screen is becoming very unreliable. The LCD itself is not having
any difficulty, just the backlight. It will turn on for a half a second,
then immediately turn off again. When it for some reason decides to stay
on for a short while, the backlight flashes very fast and the brightness
slider on the screen has no effect.

What are your ideas for what this problem is a symptom of and how to go
about fixing it?

Thanks for any information,
Evan

Seems to be a way to do it here, look for "The right way to

http://www.eden.net.nz/7/20011101pairprocmail.html

but... take care, since much undesired mail one may want to

I still think that is over qualified...

The chance that a malicious agent *can* bypass a network security
mechanism on your computer before an exploitable flaw in the mechanism
is known to you is much higher than 0%.

As I believe Mark Twain once wrote, "Put all your eggs in one basket...

iptables can do everything tcpwrappers do if you write the rules
carefully.

How on Earth are your iptables going to "break down"?

The locks and the alarms do different things.  The locks are set to try to
keep people out and the alarm lets other people know that someone is
attempting to get in.

Me, I don't push an entire room full of my private property and space
around with me wherever I go.  And I certainly don't leave that much
private property in a public place unattended.

Again, totally different functionality.  You don't have the gun to keep
people from opening the door just as you don't have the lock to scare
people that get in.

Your analogy is more like running your daemons in a chrooted environment
in addition to securing the ports with iptables or tcpwrappers.  They have
different purposes and are NOT redundant.

Me, I'm not afraid of my neighbors, so I don't lock my house.  And I don't
want to increase the amount of pain in the world, so I don't keep anything
in the house that is only a weapon.  (But anything's a weapon if you hold
it right, I suppose.)

You make the world in which you want to live.

No, door locks supposedly give protection from entry into the cabin and
keyed ignition switches (I assume you mean keyed switches) supposedly slow
down time to ignition for those who are already in the cabin.

Again, that's more like iptables and a chroot environment or running a
daemon as a non-privileged user.

Evan,

  Northwest Computer Support, off Allen Blvd. in south Beaverton is
excellent for repairing portables. I've used them a few times -- 3 -- and am

If it wasn't realized by anyone, then it wasn't real.  We're talking about
pure information, here.

I could write a "hello world" program that is 100% secure.  After that,
it's just a matter of dilligence.

Um, you can't just claim that "it defies logic" without giving a
description or pointer to the logical fallacy.

If there is no known, existing way to exploit a piece of software, it is
100% secure because nobody has the means to exploit potential
vulnerabilities.  If there is a known way to exploit the software, it is
totally insecure because anyone who knows how to use the exploit can do
so.

Good thing Mark Twain was not a sys admin ;-)

And if you apply the same restrictions with two different pieces of
software, a security bug in one of them is likely to be stopped by
the other. Or, in the case that you did not write your iptables
rules "carefully", there is a chance that your tcpwrappers config
will be correct.

I still don't know what happened to apache. I removed the package, and

Wellllll... That's just a nice way of just squashing all the messages
to a 7-bit American bastardization. :-)

You'd be a better citizen if you set encoding = 'UNICODE' and then
using Text::Iconv to convert your messages to UTF-8 based on their
specified MIME encoding.

Rich,

You may be doing what you think is right, but the hardware may not be
what you think.  If your cable is one of the newer IDE cables, it has a
twist in it that sets up the slave/master relationship.  Your setting
the jumpers may be defeating this and putting both drives in the same
mode. For kicks, why not let the hardware try its thing.  Put both
drives in cable select configuration and plug them in your cable.

Try it, it might even work.

Configure the switch ports not to negotiate. configure the personal

Personal firewall?  Is this a linux device or cisco?

In the past I have seen issues with Cisco and auto-negotiation of duplex
and speed.  Try forcing the Cisco to 100-FullDplx or whatever your
firewall can handle (try to force on both sides).

If any of the ports involved are Gig, and you are crossing over, you may
need to create a gigabit crossover cable.  In this case, you not only have
to switch the green and orange pair, but you have to swap the blue and
brown pair as well.

It seems to come back out the same way it went in, so at the moment I
am less concerned about the form it takes when it is inside.

Subject: [PLUG] Knoppix disks at Conference
Message-ID: <20040217074948.GA11371@gate.kl-ic.com>

Greetings from the International Solid State Circuits Conference in
San Francisco.  Last week I made 280 Knoppix CDs, with some customization
(more english docs) and some pointers to advertising for my consulting
business.  I put them out on a table today on the first day of sessions.
They were gone by 3PM.  I asked a few people who took them;  there was
very high interest and rather a lot of unhappy Microsoft users among
the people I talked to.  There were about 2000 chip designers at the
conference;  I imagine I could have distributed 1000 CDs if I had made
that many.

Those of you that are non-software types and attend professional
conferences might want to consider something similar.  I will keep
you informed of how well it works out, advertising-wise.

If it does work out right, I may consider going to one of the
professional CD duplication outfits and running off 1000 disks;
I think they run 80 cents a piece in that quantity.  Perhaps we
can pool efforts on this and get higher quantities at lower prices.

I think I have learned enough to do the long-put-off "library
Knoppix emergency disk", too.  

I am reminded of the old and politically incorrect story about the
two cowboys that saw a poster in town offering a bounty for the
scalps of Comanche Indians.   The fellows head out into the wild,
and spend a fruitless day looking for Comanches to capture and scalp.
They bed down for the night in a small valley.  When they wake
up in the morning, the ridges around the valley are packed solid
with thousands of Comanche warriors.  One of the Indian hunters
knudges the other in the ribs, cracks a big smile, and whoops
"we're RICH!!!!"

Sometimes I feel just like that when I think about selling open
source to the world.

Keith

I notice the difference when WD came out with something like the 500 Meg
drive. If you've got only one WD drive on a cable, no jumpers at all.
Two WD drives on the same channel used to be no jumpers. Maybe they've
changed something lately, but that's the way it was until a year ago.

http://wdc.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wdc.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_sid=8DmFh84h&p_lva=&p_faqid=54&p_created=1003440599&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9NjQ3JnBfcGFnZT0x&p_li=

http://support.wdc.com/techinfo/general/jumpers.asp

Looks like they've changed, two drives require two jumpers, but one
drive, no jumpers.

Looks like they're into playing with cable select, too. I've only used
it a few times, and IIRC, it was with WD drives in cheap PCs.

If it won't recognize as the only drive on the bus with no jumper with
the BIOS set to auto, auto, I'd suspect the IDE controller. Do you have
a spare IDE controller kicking around? I do and will be in the windy
city tomorrow, the 18th. let me know if I can drop the card by.

They're similar to ENU, a hardware vendor, but the guys know how to work
on PCs better, and they sold slightly higher grade eq. Located a mile

Evan,

  Just make sure they re-seat the keyboard completely and evenly if they
take it off. I ended up with a separate trip after they added another 256M
of RAM in my new Sony. Of course, I should have seen that before I left.

If you're just using classic Unix-style mail boxes, then the mailbox 
contents
are all in /var/spool/mail.  Disable all mail activity on the old server 
(going
single-user is one good, simple method) and then copy all those files to the
new system.

It is my point that standard settings do not work with WD drives. You
CANNOT set the master on a single drive channel to master. It must be
"neutral" (we always called it "park") or no jumper at all. 

Every other brand I've ever used requires a master jumper for master in
a single drive channel.

Am I missing something here?

Thanks everyone. After spending two late nights trying to make it work, I grabbed an older 10/100 NIC that I had laying around and installed it. It works great now. I would have liked to get it working with the onboard NIC, but I have other fish to fry.

I have done this several times in the past. I used rsync over ssh to move the users home directories and mailboxes in /var/spool/mail. I ran the rsync once, then tested everything out. Then for the go-live, I stopped sendmail, ran the rsync again, and started sendmail (or whatever smtp server you plan to user) on the new box. Then tested agian.

At least WD and Seagate, maybe others, use cable select. Several of the 
older, dead, IBM deskstar drives I have as paperweights also list cable 
select.

I don't trust cable select. It's not proven to me to be any more 
reliable than manually setting the jumpers.

I have an older (notice the tone of respect, it may be slower, but that
doesn't mean it can just give up on life), machine with a scsi zip drive
in it.  I put a disk in it and the little light came on and I believe it
was accepted.  Trouble is I don't know what to do get it going.  

I've read some older docs and they speak of rebuilding the kernel and
putting incantations in lilo an /etc/modules.conf. This older machine is
running Fedora1 and I just don't believe I have to do that, you know
modern modular kernel and all that.

Help me give a meaningful and purposeful life to this older machine.

I'd start by doing cat /proc/scsi/scsi.  You ought to see your drive listed.
For example:

Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 05 Lun: 00
  Vendor: IOMEGA   Model: ZIP 100          Rev: N*32
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02


Do you have other scsi disks?  If so, this will affect which device
(/dev/sd?) is associated with the drive.  Posting the output
from cat /proc/scsi/scsi is a good place to start.

I've got a SCSI Jaz drive accessible through /dev/sdb

But, I configured my kernel with:

   CONFIG_SCSI=y

After you do that or load a module, you should be able to see
which device it is from dmesg. E.g. from my system:

Attached scsi removable disk sdb at scsi0, channel 0, id 4, lun 0

Then I use it with:

tar ztvf /dev/sdb

Okay, we need to know what scsi controller you have.  How about /sbin/lspci

Fortunately, though I used the first person singular to describe the
situation, I can't lay claim to the response I got when I suggested the
same thing.
   I don't know about the CISCO (somebody elses baliwick) but I did sneak
a look through the LinkSys interface (Web based) for these types of
settings and didn't find them.
  I'll pick on the Techical Manager to fiddle with the CISCOs.  I'll try 
the LinkSys site.

Then all you probably need do is to set

   CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD=m

Then compile and install the module.  Your kernel should be fine.
There should be a module HOWTO somewhere out there
<http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Module-HOWTO/index.html> that you can
follow.  But, it would involve something like:

   make modules_install

Then make sure /etc/modules and /etc/modutils/sd are set up ok.
Then reboot.

Note that if you're on Debian, there's a "Debian way" of doing stuff,
namely use "make-kpkg modules_image" instead of the regular kernel make.

Uh-oh.  I don't see a scsi controller there.  I think it is time to
open up the box and see what the zip drive is connected to.

ISA board: adaptec ava-1502 connected by a  very wide ribbon
cable to the drive.  The red edge marker appears to be correctly
oriented.

Are you sure it's not an AHA-1502?  Try 'modprobe aha152x'; that will
likely fail and you'll have to specify the IRQ, IO port, etc.  Ain't ISA
fun?

I haven't seen any announcement of this month's advanced topics

Also, I just got a brand new buckling spring keyboard (i.e. like the

see/feel it, particularly those of the younger generation that have
never seen/felt/heard one before.

Perhaps it's time to visit FreeGeek and see if they still have 
PCI SCSI boards for ~$10 each and save yourself a lot of
aggravation.  It worked well for me.

Bill:

You'll need to get the jumper settings off the card for the I/O port and
IRQ.  Welcome back to the Bad Old Days before PCI became so widespread!

Try this:

insmod aha152x irq=<irq from card> io=<io from card> debug=10

This might also help:

http://www.google.com/linux?q=adaptec+ava-1502

I found the second link to be useful even though he's talking about a
scanner.

Ebay also has a constant selection of high quality SCSI cards under $20 if
FreeGeek doesn't.

I highly recommend the Adaptec 2940UW AIC-based line.

I'm going to be talking about setting up Samba 3 as Primary and Backup
Domain Controllers using LDAP (for load management or multi-side
installations).  It's gonna be hott.

I had a source some years ago; they were only about $20, but they were
the newer hard plastic instead of the original metal.  I'm using them on
most of my systems.

IDENTITY THEFT

This month's PANUG meeting is this Thursday, February 19. This
meeting is entirely focused on identity theft. We'll include
suggestions for what you can do to decrease your risk of identity
theft beyond the obvious and what you can do if your identity is
stolen.

This is a PANUG and BizNix community outreach program so 
everyone is invited. The presentation will be mostly non-technical
so anyone concerned about these issues may attend - even non-domputer
geeks.

The presentation begins at 7:00 pm. It's important that you RSVP
because we expect this to be a well-attended event. To RSVP, just
reply to this message and tell us the names of the people attending.

The meeting is held at Novell's office in Tigard across from
Washington Square. Directions are on the PANUG web site at
http://www.panug.org. Click on the meetings link.

  Is this the type that goes clicky-click as you type? Noisy things, those
were. I always preferred the soft, quiet ones.

Wow... this is the first time an ALT meeting topic coincides with
something I'm doing right now.

Neat.

So, can somebody tell me why the slapd Debian package REQUIRES X?  That's
kind of... well... fucked.

I love 'em.  Using one right now.

Are you saying that the shells of some are metal or the springs?

That give rpc.statd.  How do I block it from the external network
without blockng it inside?  I use nfs to export a dump disk for

Yep.  For whatever reason it requires xlibs which requires all kinds of
X-ish things.

So it's not obvious to you... phew.

Wow.  Wish I could get one of those.

I have several of the larger sized IBM ones and one that's about the size
of a modern cheap keyboard, but still of the IBM Selectric style.

How many people work in Linux/Unix specialties and what does the

What are the statistics on cracking as far as it's sophistication

more affective deterrents coming along and what form will they
take?

With the level of cracker sophistication, are we talking

also?  Are intelligent Linux systems on the horizon 
that actually adapt in a non preprogrammed manner to
security threats?  Not that anyone wants to see HAL

It's the libiodbc2 dependency. This is fixed in sarge and beyond.

And, FWIW, the woody slapd is pretty old. When I've run woody, I
always took the sarge package and rebuilt a package for woody, or at
least took the woody package and rebuild it with different configure
options. :-)

Looking through the dependancy heirarchy...   The slapd package depends
upon the libiodbc2 package, which depends upon libgtk1.2. Looking at the
libiodbc2 package, it turns out the program "iodbcadm-gtk" is the cause.
Seems likely "iodbcadm-gtk" should be split out, as it is likely not
required (or whoever wrote libiodbc2 needs to learn X isn't always handy
in critical situations).

Yes, at least it's been interesting. I  forgot all about isa buses. So
from the card: irq can be 9 10 11 12.  There is another jumper named
alt, and printed on the card, "in=140h, out=340h".  My irq is 11 and io
port is 140h.

So I'll put the card back in and try "insmod aha152x irq=11 io=140h
debug=10"

Ok it's working "insmod aha152x irq=11 io=0x140"

How do I make this automatic?

put "aha152x" in your /etc/modules file.
put "options aha152x irq=11 io=0x140" in /etc/modutils/aha152x
run "update-modules"

It may, for some packages... but they're easy enough to get around with

What distribution are you using? Each one does module initialization
in a (maddeningly) different way.

Well, I'd have to disagree.  While I'm sure everybody had a good old
time... they likely did as much harm as good for the linux movement.

Rallies that get in people's faces, or get in their way, do not serve to
convince people to side with the ralliers.  They just piss people off. 
I don't want people to associate linux with "a bunch of geeks getting in
my face while I ran in to Fry's to grab an ink cartridge" ...

So, count me out.

Not according to the WD site, or my personal experience.

Hey, who am I to argue with what works? I've not seen it work that way
before.

That's just weird...I guess I should qualify that I'm talking about
WD's Caviar line of drives.

Well, I think they went a little overboard swamping a dead Fry's, but
having seen other sets of photos right after it came out, I can say
those were the worst reactions you saw there.

From seniorr at aracnet.com  Wed Feb 18 02:17:02 2004
From: seniorr at aracnet.com (Russell Senior)

Subject: [PLUG] The Grand Unified Historical PLUG Mailing List Archive Project
Message-ID: <86vfm4y9o9.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I keep asking related questions, I should just come out and say what I
am working on...

Some considerable time ago (July 2001), I asked PLUG subscribers,
particularly those of ancient abidance, for their archives of PLUG
mailing list traffic.  PLUG began nearly 10 years ago (see Message-ID:
<By3OpeQ.spu at delphi.com>), and much of its early mailing list traffic
had scattered to the wind.  Skylab had started to get a little dodgy.
I wanted to sweep it all (as much as I could find) back up into a
coherent pile again.  I received contributions from 7 individuals
besides myself, and have drawn on two existing archives (skylab's and
drizzle's).

I have made a few runs at consolidating this stuff before, and in the
last few days I've started a new run at it.  The goal is to
consolidate, remove duplication, remove non-PLUG-list messages, and
provide clean messages (reconstructing to the extent possible the form
they had as they passed through the mailing list server by removing
individualized delivery and other extraneous headers).  In short,
generic but suitable for further archeology.

With a reasonably up-to-date drizzle archive (as of a few days ago)
and all my other sources, I have 218,925 total articles of which
90,821 are unique message-id's (one message-id has 17 copies!).  They
are all currently sitting in a provisional Postgresql database table.

Remaining (known) problems include:

  a) not all of those 90,000+ message-ids are PLUG list messages, and
     I don't want to pass along anything that wasn't originally
     public;

  b) many of the messages have delivery headers specific to those
     individuals that contributed their archive, as well as storage
     headers unique to their archive, whereas I want only the generic
     parts of the message headers;

  c) I want to be able to establish an accurate ordering of the
     messages;

  d) I want to identify missing messages; and

  e) I want to identify common authorship.

Each of these problems and my general associated thinking is discussed
below:

Problem a) will probably be dealt with by querying the headers of all
messages for plug-list signature items (To: lines, passing through the
mailing list host, that sort of thing) and identifying/excluding those
that lack "identifying marks".

One of the ideas I have for dealing with problem b) is that for
messages with multiple copies, find the common lines in all headers,
and use those plus an appropriate '^From ' line (these will differ,
but we need to have one).  It's not quite as simple as that because of
line folding.

 ** If anyone feels a burning need to suggest some Perl code for doing
    this, do _not_ allow me to stop you! ** (i.e., it is what I am
    working on now ;-)

This strategy isn't going to suffice for cases where we only have one
copy and it was delivered to an individual, but I am hoping that what
I learn from what gets "thrown away" from the multi-copy resolution
process will inform what I need to do in these remaining cases.

There is a similar, if less serious, problem for differing message
bodies.  For example, in the case of the 17-copy message mentioned
above, there are two variants.  It appears the difference is limited
to trailing white space (one variant looks like it has an extra \n).
Still, in multiple copy cases, the bodies should be compared.

Problem c) is complicated by the observation that "peoples clocks are
often incoherent".  The "Date:" header lines are unreliable (e.g. see
the current mailman monthly archives with messages listed in January
1980, September 2006 and August 2019).  A couple of things can help
here:

  i) using the timestamps from the "Received:" header associated with
     the mailing list host.  This clock might be wrong, but it is
     likely to be monotonicly increasing;

  ii) check using a "parent_id" (either from "In-Reply-To:" or
      "References:" headers) to ensure that antecedent messages really
      do occur earlier in the ordering.

Problem d) can be accomplished, if imperfectly, by looking at
"In-Reply-To:" and "References:" headers and seeing if those
message-ids appear in the database, and then perhaps creating
placeholder records for those not found.

Problem e) is solved manually.  Many individuals appear with slightly
permuted "From:" lines.  I want to create a table which links the
variants to a common author_id.  This will allow amusements like
computation of posting frequency (FWIW, _not_ accounting for
acknowledged message duplicates, Rich Shepard is _way_ out front
quantitatively with 15,954 of the 218,925!).  Basically, this will
require looking through the list of "From:" lines and identifying the
permutations and modifying the author table (or equivalent)
accordingly.


My zero-th order approximate end point for this project is just to
recreate a global mbox, but it is easy to imagine some kind of
web-interface to the database to enable searching, or just some
html-ification that would allow Google to index it.

General and/or specific comments, ideas, suggestions (even additional
pre-1998-07 contributions) are welcome.

See the modules.conf(5) man page for the full story, but the short
answer is to add this line to /etc/modules.conf:

options aha152x irq=11 io=0x140

I tried that, based on my modprobe success.  I thought it didn't work
but let me try it again.

Nope, doesn't work. Is there something other than that line, an alias
perhaps.  Just for fun:

A friend uses MSN for e-mail and he wants to convert from
Outlook to an Open Source program like Thunderbird running
on Windows. He gets his mail from MSN via POP3. When he
configures Thunderbird the same as Outlook, he's not able to
connect. The problems seems to be the authentication
protocol. Does anyone have details on this?

MSN uses a non standard format for retrieving mail that only OE and MSN Explorer speak. There is a program called hotwayd that will translate from Microsoft's broken protocol to a standard pop3. I have used this in the past to get Hotmail using a standard client. Take a look at the following site for more information.

Thank you. It's nice to know he has this option. I'm
going to try to convince him to move from MSN.

I'm just guessing from the activity in my mail logs over the past couple

So my question is, do you have any favorite tools for thwarting dictionary
attacks?

What service are they attacking?  SMTP w/ Auth?  POP3?  IMAP?

If the latter two, kill off the non-SSL ports completely... tunnel them
with stunnel... be happy knowing your mail is more secure.  :-)

Not having everything sent to a domain actually being accepted as a
real user, as opposed to mail accounts only existing for real users,
goes a long way.  Same with non-dictionary usernames.  Third-level
names (like my old ursine.dyndns.org) tend to stay relatively
spam-free; spammers don't seem to have a good grasp on DNS.

Try adding aha152x to /etc/modules, leaving the options in modules.conf.

I need it for a three week perl class online where the instructor,
Barbara Huseby, won't say anything about how to get it.  Course
officially starts the 23rd.  When Ed taught his class, ordering
the book was part of it.  I sure wish that was standard practice 
at PCC.  I just asked her if it was at the bookstore since I don't
want to drive out to Sylvania from Scappoose if it isn't.

Non-SSL ports for POP and IMAP were disabled long ago.

Are you sure your research skills are up to higher education?

The book is available from:
	Amazon.com
	Powells.com
	BarnesAndNoble.com
	and others I don't want to take the time to verify

Not that one would ever consider looking in book stores to find
books...

Everyone, 

I'm very sorry.  That wasn't nice.  Mr. Robinson was asking if the 
PCC bookstore had the title in stock.  I should have suggested
that he call the bookstore and ask them.  They know the answer,
the PCC bookstore number is online, that was really the information
he needed.  Not that the book can be purchased wherever one can
find it, at a discount to the bookstore price. 

I apologize again.

I've already checked Barnes and Nobles.  Part of the problem is that you
take online courses for convenience where it is not convenient at all to
have to go somewhere to pick up a book.

As far as my research skills, I think there can be a lively debate about
what research skills people with any higher education have and how
affective or ineffective college programs are at improving those
skills.  

For instance, how many colleges have any courses or self help on how to
get a hold of some book online quickly?  How many schools on the West
Coast have abandoned books altogether in favor of e-books which don't
have to be shipped or picked up?

Another issue is that you should be able to get the book on the first
day of class or within a few days of it's start.  Clearly Barbara
is putting up the info a little early, but it's beyond me why she
doesn't suggest where to get a copy.

As far as my research skills.  Using a mailing list is a valid technique
where I'm not going anywhere today to get a copy because I can't.

I have a Calc III course going where I'm barely holding it.  This is
supposed to be a 1 credit course for fun where Barbara can't even get
enough enrollment to allow people to drop without permission should they
want or need to.  Frankly, this is the first course ever where I've been
enrollment locked, talked about a turn off.

I don't appreciate an attitude that I should be tested at the cost of
convenience when I need the convenience.

As far as buying books in general to become knowledgeable, you can't
afford to do this for long when you're unemployed.

Looking at other replies... I see I misunderstood what was happening. 
When I hear 'dictionary attacks' I immediately think password cracking,
not email address guessing.  :-)

Here at OGI, we don't have a bookstore. Some professors will bulk
order an expensive book if doing so results in a substantial discount;
otherwise, all students are expected to order their books online.

They will even ship it if you don't want to drive.

Honestly though... did you even look for this? It took me approx .1 
minute to find this for you online.

In RH9 and up, bash seems to have broken ~ while in vi mode...

It used to change the case of the letter, now, it ummms, foobars the

hittI^N^SB^H?^Q^Hng

I am guess there is an oddball character between ^H and ^Q since it was
not the command line but show in the cut and paste....

I checked Powell's.  It's in a warehouse, 2-7 days shipping.  It costs
just as much to pick up at Sylvania minus shipping, I just checked.  No
I don't want to drive out to Sylvania, and yes I really do think that a
course should be designed with the idea that you pick the book up when
the course starts.  There's no reason I can think of that the syllabus
shouldn't say the book is available at the bookstore, especially if it's
cheaper to get it there than it is to order it.  The class starts on
Monday, so a 7 day shipping window won't work.

I expect guranteed two day shipping from places that are
within 30 miles of where I live, oh well.

If the book is at Powell's in downtown Portland, I didn't see this on
Powells.com.

A trip to Sylvania for math tutoring might not be a bad idea anyways.

I'll just get the book tomorrow.

Zot,

Are you running this instance of your shell locally, or over an ssh
connection?

The reason I ask is that OpenSSH's ssh client uses ~ as the escape
character. See the 'Escape Characters' section of ssh(1) for the gory
details.

I don't think this discussion is germane to the PLUG list in
any way but I have to agree with Darkhorse on this one point.
I try to always include book purchase information in my 
syllabus and if students can't get the book during the first
week of the course, I either post the first chapter of the book
on my web site or spend the first week on material not in
the book.

Also, note that he's talking about a distance learning class
that probably costs him more than an on-campus class. Distance
learning students have every right to expect a little more
convenience.

A few things...

Did you say this was a distance-learning class?  If so, then you may be
able to assume there are students from all over the place taking the
class, right?  Now, with that assumption in mind... what bookstore would
you suggest the professor instruct her students to look at?  Should
somebody in Montana be told the book is in Portland?  I think not.

You're in college now.  This isn't high school.  It is assumed students
in college have the motivation and intelligence to go find books they
need for a course.  It was *clearly* demonstrated to you the book is
*very* easy to find, if you are so motivated.  If I remember the thread
correctly, you know of two physical places within an hour of where you
live you can pick the book up at.  There are a plethora of online
retailers who have the book for you.

You mention time constraints... I thought you'd been taking college
courses for a few years now?  How many classes have you attended where
the professor assumed the students in the course had the book before the
third class session?  I can count the number of times that's happened to
me on one hand.  It is an unwritten rule you really don't need the book
until the third class session.  Hell, in my experience, you can make it
through a CS course just fine without a book at all!  The writers of the
books probably got most of their material from the web, anyway.

I think it is time to step up and take a little bit of responsibility
for yourself here, Michael.  It isn't the professor's job to hand hold
you through everything related to taking a course... her job is to teach
you in class and make sure your tests/papers/projects are graded.

My two and a half cents.

But /etc/modules just identifies modules to load at boot time, which is
not needed (unless he *wants* to boot from his scsi zip drive, that is).

I'd suggest trying instead, within /etc/modules.conf:

options aha152x irq=11 io=0x140
probeall scsi_hostadapter aha152x

OR

options aha152x irq=11 io=0x140
probeall scsi_mod aha152x

OR

options aha152x irq=11 io=0x140
above aha152x

The reason being that scsi device modules need base scsi interface code.
If Fedora doesn't use the generic scsi_hostadapter, scsi_mod might work,
or failing that, "above aha152x" modules resolution might do the trick.

Robert Munro

Message-ID: <BAY9-F5OeBkObxuqdIR0003eeb7@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I have VNC server running on a linux box and I am trying to connect
to that linux box at :0 from another box (as the client).  I cannot connect
and the message was saying that there are no VNC server running at :0.

I tried to launch, on the server end, a VNC server on :0 but it always
said that there is already one running (when there isn't run, other than the 
X server).
So VNC server always start on :1 (if I don't designate any option).

Does that mean I cannot connect to VNC_SERVER:0?  Or is there a config step 
that I miss?

thanks for any tip...

Subject: [PLUG] Checkinstall and Slackware-9.1
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0402191932240.30981@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  For those who don't know, checkinstall is a replacement for 'make install'
when building an executable from a source tarball. Checkinstall will build a
package (Red Hat, Slackware or Debian), then install it. This registers the
application in the package database and lets us manipulate it as we would
any other installed package. It's a great tool.

  When I use it on my Red Hat 7.3 system it produces both .src.rpm and
.i386.rpm for me to use as I wish. I could even rebuild the .src.rpm for a
specific architecture.

  However, when I run the version that comes with the Slackware distribution
disks, it apparently builds and installs the package, but the remaining .tgz
is not a full package; it's only a few hundred bytes in size.

  Does anyone know why this is? More importantly, how do I get a package
built on one machine that can be moved and installed on another machine?

TIA,

Rich

What is it you're building?  What's in that few-hundred-byte-long file? 
Might be a bug in checkinstall, or the program you're building might be
doing something funky.

When I make packages (I've put three up on Linuxpackages.net so far), I
don't use checkinstall... I configure and make as normal, then make
install DESTDIR=/tmp/build_root and then I cd to /tmp/build_root, set
things up (documentation, slack-desc, permissions), then do a makepkg.

My guess is that VNC detects your regular X session and refuses to take
the same number as that session. I have never had any problems with
using :1 for my VNC servers. Why would you need to run VNC on :0?

No, read carefully, it is not '~' that is the escape char, but '<CR>~'

It only escapes if you hit return, then ~.

You are doing this in vi mode?

I just tested on a console and it hit.

Interestingly, it only did this on the RH9 boxes, not the FC1 boxes.

/etc/inputrc  is the same for both....

Yup.  Can you think of anything else that would affect your key behavior?

just wanted to note that there are much better books out there on perl than A 
Little Book on Perl. Also, the book is really not needed for the class. There 
are many tutorials online that will more than take care of anything that you 
need to know for this class. This class is _very_ basic. If you are going to 
actually spend money on a perl book, i would highly recommend getting 
something that has more substance than this book.

Message-ID: <1077295709.1027.5.camel@apollo.spears.org>

I have a computer with Fedora1 installed that is having trouble
booting.  Specifically, it stalls just after reporting something about
yenta's irq.  The line after that  says socket 3000001 or something
close to that.  This boot failure also happens when I boot from the boot
disk I  made when I installed Fedora. 

Fortunately, it will boot in the rescue mode from the Fedora1 install
CD.  I did notice that the socket return was different, more like
3000004.

I'll check the two socket returns if it matters.

Anyone?

Is this the same computer you put the ISA SCSI card into?  Is this a
laptop or otherwise PCMCIA-enabled system?  A couple of guesses: You've
set the SCSI card's IRQ to be the same as the PCMCIA controller.  Or you
don't have a PCMCIA contoller, in which case, you can disable PCMCIA
start-up with 'chkconfig pcmcia off'.

This is a laptop.  I can only think of two things that may be relevant:
   1) I added more memory.  But it had been working after this.
   2) It's battery finally quit and it shutdown while connected
       to the LAN.
   3) I just ordered an expensive battery for it, God hates me
       and decided to make it die at this time.

Subject: [PLUG] Missing /dev/cdrom
Message-ID: <1077301440.1029.8.camel@apollo.spears.org>

I went to mount a cdrom as: # mount /dev/cdrom and it said there was no
such device.  I've done this many times before so I don't know what
could have happened.  This is a CD-RW drive with the option hdc=ide-scsi
installed.
fstab has the correct line for /dev/cdrom.

There was a lot of this:(dmesg)
ide-scsi: hdc: unsupported command in request queue (0)
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 0
ide-scsi: hdc: unsupported command in request queue (0)
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 2


Does this make any sense?

Bill,

  In /dev, do you have a softlink from /dev/sda -> /dev/cdrom? Looks to me
as though the link might have broken.

Thanks, Rich. I already fixed it.  I thought it must be something
exotic, but I decided that maybe I just deleted /dev/cdrom somehow.
So I remade the link and everything works. I guess the ide-scsi part
makes me a little nervous. I'm not sure whether hdc is ide or scsi, or
whether hdc is the same as scd0 which may be the same as sda1.  Anyhoo,
it works.

Hmmmm, I emailed Ms. Huseby and quickly received this reply:

  The book should be in the bookstore at PCC Sylvania.  It is an optional
  text.  You will not have any reading assignments from the text.
  Thanks for the information.

So:

  a) it is not needed for the class
  b) the instructor will say something about how to get it

Thanks Wil, I fixed it.  I think some files got munged when it crashed. 
I booted with the Fedora install, chrooted, killed off pcmcia with
chkconfig, rebooted, fiddled around a  bit more, but for now it boots
fine.

The 678 and the ActionTec should both be DMT modems, so I would expect
that you should not need a new modem at all.  Just Qworst giving you a
line, either intentionally or (more likely) because the tech has no
idea.

I would suggest that you push really hard for them to do as much testing
as possible on your main line before moving it though, because you may
very well get stuck having to put it back on the original line. 
Depending on where you are in relation to your Central Office, the two
lines may take entirely different routes and have completely different
signal characteristics.

I'm creating different documents that have tons of radio buttons and

On a side-note, does anyone know why Mozilla Composer doesn't provide the

Why don'tcha just generate the form programmatically in perl with CGI.pm?

You just write a little loop and read in your data file (containing button
values and commentary text) and it goes.

Doesn't even need to be a dynamic page, just write the code, run the
script and save the output.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0402201340110.21534@well.com>

Hi:

I am looking at both Amanda and Dirvish (or Dervsh) for a backup
recovery solution.

According to the documentation, Amanda has an X based gui front
end.

I cannot, however, find any WEB based (preferably a Webmin module)
front end for either backup tool.

Does anyone out there know of any web/webmin front ends for Amanda
or Dirvish?

Or does anyone know of any GPL backup/restore system that has a
WEB or Webmin front end to it.

I am working on a project where I am hoping to relieve the end user
of any required command line (shell) interactions.

Thank you

Write a script to replace whatever it was they did?  ;-)

Mark,

  Why not set up a cron job so no UI is necessary?

Thanks and Oops:

Thanks to all of those who have responded to my question.

I think I mis-asked the question.

I do plan to have a cron script do the daily/weekly backups
themselves. That's not the issue.

The issue for me is to have it easy as possible for them to do
a file recovery.

Here is the scenario that I envision. A manager comes crying on
the shoulder of the secretary (who is the sysadmin) and needs a
file restored that was accidentaly erased. The sysadmin/secretary
is not a linux/unix savvy person. They want/need a gui/web based front
end to enable them to do the restore as painlessly as possible.

What I am looking for is more of a web/gui front end to do file
restores and unplanned backups (the manager wants the grant proposal
that he/she slaved over during the past several hours to be backed
up right away before it's erased by mistake).

Thank you

Mark Allyn

Checkout BackupPC.  Has a nice web interface for doing user
self-recovery as well as administration.  It is particularly good for
backups of lots of identical content (e.g. a bunch of PC's with the
same system files), because of the interesting way it stores the
data.  Works with unix boxes via tar or rsync, or windows boxes via SMB.

That said, I don't use it myself, but it sounds like a good match for
your problem.

Geez, I already pointed this out myself as a reason why I like Ed's
online courses that include ordering the text as part of the
coursework.  Not that you're paying attention to everything I've

There are CS courses many people can't get through at all, book or no
book.  One of these is Karla Fant's 202 course.  As far as insulting a
person on how long they've been in college, at least when I graduate I'm
more likely to be current than someone who finished say three years
ago.  At least I have the guts to pursue something after multiple cases
of harassment and disappointment unlike a person who holds that college
is either 4 years or bust.  In the long run, the time factor isn't going
to be an issue.  Heck, there may even be an economy when I get out.

The smart people are those willing to ask dumb questions and pursue
avenues that make their responsibilities lighter even if someone like
Rob decides to harangue them for it.  For crying out loud I asked about
a book people, just a book.
 
> Rob


You just ignored the earlier part of the thread that said it would have
been better to tell me it's at the bookstore.  I did check some of the
suggestions, there wasn't a gurantee I'd get the book on time for the
course.  As far as the Montana comment, why would I be taking classes in
a school situated in the middle of religion haters' paradise if I lived
there?  Chances are, if I lived in Montana, that I'd be a conservative
interested in distance learning through colleges in more conservative
regions.  Why don't you grow up and stop tearing other people down?  As
far as hand holding, I've literally held the hand of another adult when
she needed it where I'm not ashamed of that at all.  There are some
adults who believe it's okay to reach out to other adults for help and
information compared to those who pursue personal isolation as a pride
issue.  As far as taking responsibility, at least I'm ignoring you
staying on a list I can benefit from.

Not that it's any of Rob's business, but going out to Sylvania and
buying the book wasn't a bad idea since that trip gave me a chance to go
to the tutoring center there.  In general, maybe asking about a perl
book here is a way of saying that I'm studying perl in a good place to
say it.  

Rob, your reply is as low as Brelin's castigation of an old elderly
woman complaining that computers didn't exist in her day.  Reminds me of
the castigation of Quayle, it shows that a great deal of social decay is
evident in some of the individuals who participate on this list.

Bluefish is a GUI based WYSIWIG editor with strong support for web

Many many people have passed Karla's CS 202 course.  I think a single
case of somebody not being able to pass the course when most people *do*
pass the course is more of an indicator of that single person than of
the course itself.

In my experience, Karla has been more than fair in her grading.

I'm sorry if you felt I was insulting how long you've been in college. 
I'm really the last one to speak ... I started schooling at PSU in the
fall of 2000 and am just now a Junior.  :-)

Your time in college has surely shown you, however, that you don't need
a book on the first day of class (which was, actually, what I was trying
to say).

Most people take five years to complete a four year degree these days...
especially a technical degree.

Doh. Maybe WYSIWYG wasn't a good description. It does have wizard-like
interfaces for creating form elements (radio buttons, selects, etc.)

Personally, I would probably write scripts to do the coding for me. As
Dave is fond of saying: "real men don't write programs, they write
programs that write programs".

Dan,

  Then you want to look carefully at the evolutionary algorithm literature.
There are models that write computer code and keep evolving the code until
it is optimal.

I've got a video of John Koza (not sure exactly why, it appeared

his Genetic Programming ideas.  Maybe I'll bring it to the clinic

Wow. From Koza's page on GP (http://www.genetic-programming.com):

"There are now 36 instances where genetic programming has automatically
produced a result that is competitive with human performance, including 15
instances where genetic programming has created an entity that either
infringes or duplicates the functionality of a previously patented
20th-century invention, 6 instances where genetic programming has done the
same with respect to a 21st-century invention, and 2 instances where
genetic programming has created a patentable new invention."

Riverdale *must* have a VCR. The trouble will be finding time to watch the
video while the Clinic is in session.

Did they say why you needed the new modem?  If it is because of the change 
to a different DSL mode, the 678 should be able to do it.  (I had to do 
that to one modem.)

Is it possible to get a more technical response other than "because i said 
so"?

The instructions to change modes on the 678 is in the back of the 678 
manual.

It is pretty easy. Requires a serial port and terminal app and maybe that 
weird serial cable.

  Of course, none of these came out of Redmond, you know.

Connect to the serial port with minicom.  You should get a prompt from the

Dan, et al.,

  If you want to read more about GP, I can recommend "AI Application
Programming" by M. Tim Jones and "An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms" by
Melanie Mitchell (the best introduction to the subject). Mitchell's book has
a specific section on evolving computer programs.

Yeah.  The technique is also fairly easy to parallelize.  There are
some patents on the technique, but the upside is they should expire in
the next few years.

I was thinking maybe we could just put it on during the clinic and

Anyone know if this is the case with a 675 as well? I just moved my DSL
over to another line and so far no joy. (too busy to call and whine)

Now that I know it may be a config issue, I do believe I'll spend several
hours mucking with it. May be useless, but a hellava lot more interesting
than talking to Qwest.

No.  The 675 only does CAP; the 678 does CAP and DMT.  DMT is the new
encoding and is better from what I've read, so it's not an entirely
boneheaded move on their part (although it was a move that happened
several years ago).

Apparently there is a hack for 675 to 678 conversion. I
understand that it has a bit of risk of making a
paperweight, but hey. . . you need to replace the 675
anyways - and it makes a very nice paperweight.

More info to follow.

I gave Google a spin and everything I found said that the 675 is
lacking the physical hardware required to do DMT.

Heheh, I remember when my buddy Dan had done a programming project for
one of his classes back in high school involving genetic programming.
The school provided him with an old 486 (aka Pizza Boxes there, since
all the 486s had a case that was the same area but a little thicker
than a pizza box).  Good thing he was keeping his source on floppy
disk and making sure there was no floppy in the drive when he ran the
compiled code, eventually some of the "winning" programs won because
they eliminated the others in the process, which would then evolve
into a more virulant form.  He toasted the OS on that box at least
four times that I know of in the process of this project...

What the Super 8 lacked in audio quality, it made up for in picture

Subject: [PLUG] LVM in Linux 2.6.3
Message-ID: <1077346237.1775.323.camel@timmy>

On the recommendation of a friend, I am trying to update my desktop
machine to the brand-new 2.6.3 kernel. However, I am having some
troubles with LVM. All of my partitions, except for /, are in one big
volume group. 

The 2.6 menuconfig includes an option for "device mapper support." The
help for this option says that higher level volume manager such as LVM2
use that driver.

Gentoo provides an ebuild called 'lvm2', but I don't have it installed.
How can I tell if I use lvm 1 or 2, and how can I get support for
whatever I have in the 2.6 kernel?

Thanks,
Evan

I'm running many vnc sessions on my servers here at the house. What I have
encountered here is that when the X server is running and there is already a
GUI on the local screen (:0) then you need to utilize (:1) (Gee, it looks
like I'm face happy today) I'm currently running :1 :2 :3 all on the same
box. (Different resolutions.)

What exactly does your .vnc/<machine-name>:<display number>.log file say?

I don't think so.  I'm pretty sure all those educational films were 16mm.

Super 8 was the stuff you took to the beach when I was a tot.

If fair is all you care about.  Last I talked with her, she was
wondering why so many didn't pass 202, including me, especially
considering that I passed the midterm and final.  It's her assignments
that are too difficult.  As far as the tutors that term they clearly had
passed the course, but they were excessively lazy and nowhere to be seen
for a good month.  In four weeks time, the programming backlog got so
overwhelming there was no way I was getting anywhere.  When they did
show up, they treated the class like a pack of losers and were mostly
noncommittal to any actual tutoring.  If Karla's fair, she's
unapproachable.  She didn't come off as a woman in any condition to help
students when I worked with her.  Nonetheless, I've passed three of her
courses.  Karla's just plain mean with her assignments where it's
arguably her teaching style to be that way.  Her stories tell you that
too though, my favorite being about some coworker starting to ask her a
question only to frantically answer it herself before Karla could reply
( probably because Karla was more frightening than the problem ).  She's
a great person, it's just that her courses hurt.  I didn't care for her
personal comments against her own parents in 202 the winter term before,
but I guess a person has to have a shell against that sort of thing.  
I tried 202 before C got pulled out of it, I don't know what it's like
now at PSU or even who offers it.

Maybe with newfound confidence and some help I'd go back and give cs202
another shot.  I'd have to be readmitted first, guess a degree earned
after being academically dismissed helps.  I tried to argue an issue
against a lawyer, Chris Carey. He opposed me to the point of things
getting extremely ugly.( three inches from my face yelling at me in
front of the whole class. )  Needless to say, I was rattled and didn't
speak incredibly well.

I'm not necessarily planning on a computer related degree anymore.  Lack
of support and my highly unrealistic chances of finishing in C.S. weigh
heavily on me.  I am far less interested than I was even three months
ago.  If I could accomplish anything in the CS field, I'd make computer
science a 4 year degree again.  In CS and even math courses, how many
professors design the curriculum taking into account that it might be
hard for a student to find a tutor capable of revealing the subtleties
which unlock the rest?  Many professors want students to figure stuff
out on their own without their help.  In reality, it's best if courses
are designed to be more doable without tutors compensating for poorly
written textbooks.  You can only hear something once, yet it can be read
about in a well written text many times.  It's not unreasonable to think
a professional wants to be able to pick up a book and refresh on a topic
from reading about it alone later.  It's also seemingly reasonable for a
professor to study what students ask tutors and simply hand this stuff
to everyone the first day of class or distribute these
answers/explanations on a web page.



We're far enough off topic now, I think.  I'm through with the thread...
if you wish to address anything else I've said in this email, I would

The other replies have been friendly.  I'm also done posting to the list
on this thread.  I hope my postings encourage people to reach out to
others and not come down hard when it's unnecessary to do so or there's
more to know than what is immediately evident.  

I have the little book on perl and have perused it some already.  I've
experienced socket programming with perl thanks to help from this list. 
While the course is not the depth of perl I want, it's a step in the
right direction at least.  

I have zero database training which I want to change soon, though I
haven't figured out how to go about that yet.

I want to take the equivalent of Calculus based physics term 1 at PSU
because that's what's causing most of my trouble there.  I have to pass
it at PSU to get the grade changed,.  I didn't know the rules the way I
should have back in 2000 where I was being yelled at by none other than
the registar or some admissions counselor that first term.  I thought I
had to do what she said.  Physics probably isn't something I want to
take a fifth crack at until I've completed a four year degree.  Without
retaking physics at PSU, I don't see how I can ever have a decent gpa
there or even graduate from there.  If your allowed a W for a course
that is paid for but not finished the same should be allowed for a
flunked course.

I don't have much useful information to add, but I do know that
migrating LVM volumes from 2.4 to 2.6 is apparently a major hurdle in
the development of Fedora Core 2.

IOW, you're not alone...

As noted in these forum posts (the Gentoo ones), LVM is quite a bit 
different in 2.6 than it was.  It is no longer all in the kernel.  
Instead, the kernel supports a low level thing called device mapper 
that does the grunt work of tying volumes together and doing the 
sector mapping.  On top of that, in userspace, is a set of tools that 
do things like device discovery.  EVMS and LVM have been rewritten to 
work on top of device mapper.  LVM2 is the new userspace portion of 
LVM.

I think that LVM2/DM supports both a new format and the old one.  I 
think your existing drives should work, but it will take a little 
twiddling.

I haven't used LVM in 2.6 yet.  I may just move to EVMS as it doesn't 
involve bit kernel patches anymore (all in userspace).

Best,
Kyle

I'm back up, but not with 2.6.3. There has been some progress:

vgscan now correctly finds the volume group 'vg'.
vgchange -a y fails to run unless I modprobe dm-mod (this is good
because it indicates that I have the right version of the lvm
utilities), but it fails differently once the module is loaded:

# vgchange -a y
  device-mapper ioctl cmd 0 failed: Invalid argument
  0 logical volume(s) in volume group "vg" now active
#

I am trying to track this down through google (and the gentoo forums),
but I'm posting here in case this error is familiar to someone.

So perl 5.0.8 is required, the part that says a database should be used
makes me wonder.  I get the impression that all that is needed is a
list of unique triplets built up over time.  What version of postfix
supports gray listing?  Is there a list out there of violator MTA's that
don't retry transmission?  Why do certain MTA's fail to retry?  To a
certain degree, shouldn't ISP's be containing virus based spam better?

There could be a requirement that you can run a mail 
server but have to go through an ISP controlled relay 
to go outside of your own network.  This would cut down 
on spam since the spammers could get filtered at the 
source by their own service providers.  The obvious thing 
to do that won't violate civil rights is to check for non 
content based signs of spamming at this ISP relay hub.  I 
say give an smtp relay at the ISP on a nonstandard port 
and block outbound traffic for ports not normally used 
by clients, including the standard smtp port.  Allow 
people to have their own mailservers that can go out, 
just make sure they have to use your smart relay to do 
so so that you can prevent outbound spamming.  If someone
is spammed but can always trace back to an ISP and the
ISP's are made responsible, the spam problem can be
minimized.  

If noone sends email onto the Internet from a private server,
unsolicited email can be completely banned or restricted to
safe forms by ISP level controls.  This would mean licensing
all ISP's and going after the ones that don't control their 
users.  I think the ISP's should be licensed and be the only
ones allowed to put email out on the Internet.

How in Postfix do I restrict to sending through mail exchangers instead
of directly out?  It may be easier to set up a graylisting relay 
than modifying my existing hub is.  All I want to control is who the
smtp port is open to, my main server already virus checks.

What percentage of Internet content providers that are legit use sites
and hosting services that also support spamming?

Uh, the decision that something is spam is a content-based decision.
There is no separation.

And through this licensing procedure and narrowing of the internet's
scope, you've just given a single point of control over all internet email
to whatever power structure you've created.

You've just taken something beautifully decentralized and open and closed
up and made it proprietary.

And, of course, you have totally ignored the fact that licensing
authorities are not worldwide while the internet is.

I still submit that the forced closing of mail relays has only intensified
the spam problem and narrowed the functionality of the internet with no
benefit in return.

As I have mentioned before -- I normally lurk here (which doesn't mean
that I don't have opinions -- I do).

I have to say that Jeme has effectively answered this email. As a
Canadian -- we are slightly less regulated than our US counterparts, but
still more regulated than I would like.

Email is meant to be free. Go ahead and filter it -- don't read it,
delete it -- but for Christ sake -- don't let it get in the hands of
Government -- they will just fsck it up worse than it is already.

You have the right to delete your email -- you have the right to toss
the unsolicited spam that is delivered to your real life mail box (e.g.
flyers, and other junk that comes with your newspaper).

When we put email in the hands of our Governments -- we have surrendered
one more freedom. Spam is easily controlled already -- use SA or train
your own filters to delete it.

I think that as soon as we complain too loudly for regulation? Indeed we
will get regulation. Soon the NSA will read all our email and determine
in advance if we really wish to receive a particular email.

Isn't Canada torturing Catholic priests who speak out against homosexual
couples or any other Catholic teaching that isn't considered politically
correct?  I hear money talking, it's not the Motion Picture Association
of America though it's definitely someone whose acting like they will
lose if there is any censorship.

Excuse me, why are we taking God's name in vain as if government is
Satan?  What happened to render to Caesar what is Caesar's and God
what is God's?  I have far more faith in government.

There's no freedom when it comes to junk mail, individuals and
corporations have minimized the usefulness of an important modern tool.
The NSA won't read everyone's email because there is too much.  This is
never a realistic possibility the way it's being stated and it's not
something I've proposed.

We're talking about viruses here, by law ISP's can be restricted from
perusing any content that doesn't test positive for viruses.  If you
want privacy, encrypt your message, it should still pass a virus test.

A virus is a virus is a virus.  I also see nothing wrong with destroying
improperly formed email where there's an attempt to forge the source or
return address.  Checking for viruses and forged headers does not
require content analysis.  Protecting absolute anarchy on a public
network makes no sense at all if you value order and utility.

Yes, why should untraceable email servers be allowed?  You can still
have your mail server, you'd merely have to program it to send through
your ISP's relay.  I don't consider everything that someone tries
to send me holy where certain messages can be harmful to mine and
others' state of mind.

Try tracking an unregistered site.  If people only accept from ISP email
servers and the ISP's are not abusive, it will help.  Technology can be
used to minimize the spam problem as much as custom and policy can be
leveraged.

You're forgetting that the net is a collection of homes as much as it is
a collection of businesses, it should be more difficult to send certain
content to some places than others in the interest of protecting
people's privacy and protecting society.  Now, I see no reason why there
can't be an anonymous system where people download ratings from a
trusted provider that help them deny connectivity altogether to and from
trouble sites.  Government has decency laws to protect children and
society which are very appropriate and very necessary.  There are
predatory activities on the net that need to be curbed where it's
going to take government activity to curb them.  I remind you that
private companies would have the say on what crosses the Net guided
hopefully by their customers.  The licensing would be concerned
with ISP's commitment to contain and control viruses and spammers
who are their own customers.  There are unintrusive ways to determine
that a customer is sending out spam or viruses.  A lot of this trash
gets into the wild and reeks havoc where that has to be weighed against
free speech rhetoric.  Is destructive speech protected under free
speech?

It can be as simple as saying that all ISP's have to force their users
through proxies offering them ratings from whatever rating body they
choose.

The Internet is heavily abused to the point of destroying hundreds of
thousands of marriages and worse.  It's the Internet that is free while
too many of it's users suffer from cyber addictions and being stalked by
predators or advertisers.  Media practices that work on more passive
media aren't appropriate for the Internet.  Try an estimated 200k sick
American men.  Now look at 17 year olds online.  Content is an issue.

> > And, of course, you have totally ignored the fact that licensing

Why treat sources outside your own country equally?  I have a lot of
problems with what is coming out of Canada, a nation that has been
performing gay marriages before it even became an issue here for just
one example.  I'm not impressed with the whole entertainment line up
that comes out of Canada either, much of this makes local broadcast 
television almost as bad as what's on the net.  Does it need to
be legal for a particular type of content to flow freely across 
the net if the availability of that content brings more harm than 
good to society?  Media providers have been asked to regulate
themselves.  Have they?  Do today's movies and television demonstrate
restraint and good taste?  Is it right in the name of free speech for
the Internet to support the worst prostitution operations the world has
ever seen?  Worshiping speech over the welfare of one's fellow man is
not being his keeper.  Free speech twisted to protect what harms society
reeks of something awful.  Was it Ted Bundy who commented that Internet
erotica made him kill all those women?  

Maybe global networks the size of the Internet will be the world's
undoing.  Maybe they are a mistake of mammoth proportions.  Is there
a functional world body capable of regulating the Internet, the U.N.
along with other similar bodies doesn't even work.

> > I still submit that the forced closing of mail relays has only intensified

If you have to receive spam to know it's spam, you've already lost.  If 
a relay spams someone, I'm all for it being closed.  Viruses that 
create junk mail need to be stopped.

As far as Canada goes, Canadians need to stop sending all manner of
trash around the world.  In fairness though, I have to say the same 
for any other country that does too.

It is reasonable to ban adult entertainment from the Internet or
regulate it more to protect society as a whole.  Something similar 
could be done about drug ads and ads in general that are unsolicited.
For drugs, controlling these ads may lower their cost shifting more
money to drug developement.

Yes............. you make valid arguments.

You should take one last hit on the crack pipe and read what you wrote.

Typical American response............. read it again......... are you
sober when you write such drivel and believe it??

While I find you mildly amusing in your Canuck bashing? 

You are the atypical Merican. The holier than thou (at the same time
espousing free speech).  

I am Canadian.............. I am proud of it. Go fuck yourself!!

I will not enter into a debate with you. You have already shown that you
have a closed mind -- why don't you go find more wmd in Iraq? You
americans are idiots in the minds of us Canucks.

Americans = From those nice ppl that brought you Microsoft

I have to apologize to the list for my last post.

While I don't back down from any of my assertations, I do apologize for my language; especially as it relates to Canuck = American relations.

I meant to post in private.... I posted public. I do stand by the assertations that I made, if you wish to debate with me? I would enjoy that!

Again I apologize for the confusion..............

Steve

Subject: [PLUG] Anybody successful with Actiontec R1524SU "DSL Gateway" and Qwest?
Message-ID: <20040222143404.GN28881@peak.org>

I got hooked up with Qwest DSL on Friday (in Corvallis), and am having
a miserable time with the modem.  If anybody else has had better luck
I'd love to hear about it, if only to ease my suspicion that I'm
wasting my time.

Getting outbound connections going was easy enough.  That is, it seems
to work for the kind of surfs-and-checks-email user they have in mind.
But I want to run a real firewall (LEAF), forward ssh to an admin
machine for when I'm traveling, host a web server, etc.  I've done
this before with cable, but now the Actiontec box seems to be getting
in the way (primarily by providing an unconfigurable firewall, and by
requiring frequent powercycling as soon as I change any of the default
settings.)

I have a dynamic IP address, if that matters.  Qwest "tech support"
suggested that a static address would be better, but couldn't explain
why it'd matter.

Anyway, I'm not looking for setup help (yet :-).  I just want to know
if I'm wasting my time.  My daughter has a ton of homework to do so
it'll be a few days before I can try any further tweaking.

Also, does anybody know if there are less ambitious modems available
that'll work with Qwest, or if switching to another DSL provider
(available in Corvallis, which Speakeasy isn't) would help?

Thanks,

--Eric

I have a Cisco 678 that works fine in Portland.  When I talked to them
(Qwest) about moving my DSL to my other line they said I'd have to
switch to Action Tech.  Others on the list said there was no reason to
switch, that Cisco 678 also does DMT, whatever that is.

You know, there's nothing more demoralizing to me than to have a thread
that I started, on a perfectly legit on-topic issue, degrade in to this
nonsense. It seems to be a repeating pattern on this list.

It sure would be nice if folks could post questions here without fear of
their thread going to hell.

Canada is less regulated than the US?  That is odd.  I had always gotten
the impression Canada was far more socialistic than the United States...
far more willing to jump in and regulate things.  Take medicine for

I agree.  Such efforts to regulate email at the national or local level
are just plain insane and show a lack of understanding of the Internet.

To bring a little bit of topicality back to this thread... SpamAssassin
does do a pretty good job.  I've been stress testing it with a
spam-ridden old email account lately and have had less than two spams a
day make it through.  These are well-crafted spams that already made it
through one level of spam filtering.

On the mail client side... I've been giving people Thunderbird lately,
teaching them how to use its spam controls, and letting them run free. 
Most have reported positive results.  :-)

Have you tried the web interface?  We've done this kind of thing before

In there early days of DSL deployment, there were several different
kinds of DSL. IDSL, SDSL, VDSL, etc. Of ADSL, the original modulation
standard was CAP. Don't remember what it stands for. Anyhoo, it used
all the ADSL frequency band at once and was a more or less "all or
nothing" affair as far as carrier negotation and maintenance. DMT came
next and as far as I know, is still "it", due to it being rather good
and due to existing infrastructure costs. It stands for Discrete
Multi-tone. (I may be slightly wrong on that acronym, too.) The idea
now is that the frequency band is subdivided into lots of little
discrete sub-bands. Then when the modem negotiates with the DSLAM, it
will figure out which frequencies the line is incapable of carrying
(due to noise and physical limits) and ignore those. It is therefore
more robust.

A "long" time ago I was trained for tech support on this stuff, but
it's all fuzzy and I didn't do it for very long. I believe DMT is also
the only one capable of autoscaling it's speed, but I wouldn't stand
behind that.

Might give some hints.  It looks like alot of the hardware numbers

  Well, my new system is back to booting and running just fine with its new
hard drive. Mike de la Mater stopped by, found a bent pin on the cd-rom
drive data socket (reason for that going flaky), pulled drive data cables
and reseated them and ended up putting the jumpers on the two drives just
the way I had them: 60G drive master, 80G drive slave.

  While Mike glared at the unit, I powered it on and all drives were
instantly detected by the BIOS. After booting, 'cfdisk', 'mkreiserfs' and
the creation of three new mount points and modifications to /etc/fstab, the
new drive is purring along and ready for work.

  Just one of those computer moments, I guess. Or, more likely, Mike's
glaring was more effective than was mine.

  Anyway, a public "thank you" to Mike for volunteering to stop by on his
way to another appointment.

  Perhaps those of you who administer mixed-OS environments can answer this
question: Why do winduhs users top-post their responses to messages and
leave the entire message to which they are replying on the bottom?

  I send my responses back with each comment following the appropriate chunk
of quoted text. But, they never seem to get a clue. Is this because that's
the only way -- or the default -- for Lookout! and Lookout Faster and no one
tries to do anything different?

That's pretty much it.

Also, the Microsoft MUAs default to HTML mail with only a different color
font tag (and some meaningless indentation) to indicate quoted material.
It's kind of difficult to insert your comments into quoted text without it
showing up inside the font tag.  The editors just don't know the
difference between mail and anything else.

>From the editor's perspective, a forward and a reply are the same thing
and that just adds to the confusion.

The system they've supported is more like IM than email.  It doesn't
matter how much context is carried forward in little volleys like "Lunch
today?" "OK, how about 12:30?" "Sounds good.  I'll ask Dave."

Worthless for substantial correspondence.

Oh, and also they don't provide a nice, single-line quote reference as
above.  You get a sort of summation of headers rather than a quote
reference.  That's dumb, too.  Again, it looks more like a forward than a
reply.

That's the default, AFAIK. Plus, your average Windows user tends to be
less informed on netiquitte issues.

For one thing, it is the default for Microsoft Outlook to start entering 
text at the top of the message.  It also ignores any issues with 
maintaining attributions, forwarded headers, and stripping signatures. 
Not to mention the fun that happens with HTML messages and forwarded 
messages.

I typically dislike e-mail messages that quote the entire thread --
running six or seven levels of quoting -- but there are a rare few
occasions when it's nice.

I find that's especially true when the issue at hand has more to do
with policy than technology. In a policy discussion, it's somewhat
easier to snip an apparently useless paragraph that is later deemed
significant.

That'd be very cool: mailing list software that automatically makes
available the URL to the archived copy of threads quoted in the reply
message (like I did in the opening footnote of this message :-).

  Thanks, Dan. The latter is certainly true! Plus, I suspect that the vast
majority of winduhs users never think to look beyond the defaults.

  More than a dozen years ago, when I was hired by a local consulting
company, I was the only one who knew _anything_ about computers. We used
WordPerfect-5.1/DOS for all processed words. One day one of the principals
walked by and asked why my screen was black with grey letters when everyone
else's was blue with bright, white letters. I told him that I had changed
the colors. Next thing I knew, I had to show everyone how to change screen
colors and do all the other neat things that could be changed.

Ian,

  There is such a mechanism; I've used it for more than a decade. I have a
mail file for every client and every project. I can trace a dialog thread
from start to finish. It was just such a record that allowed me to convince
a client to pay what they owed. Of course, it was the day before my attorney
filed suit in Multnomah County District Court, but pay they did.

Message-ID: <20040223041343.52810.qmail@web9610.mail.yahoo.com>

This is my last message on the subject. Honest!

I obtained a 160-GB hard drive and needed the Promise
Ultra100 TX2 to support the large capacity. My
problems with it using Linux were documented earlier,
but I had some trouble with Windows, too. 

Most recently I ordered a 120-GB drive which is on the
way (<137 GB). When it arrives, apparently Tuesday, I
shall remove the add-on controller and connect the new
drive to the blue 40-pin socket on the motherboard,
using a round IDE cable that glows in the dark, and I
think my problems will disappear. 

Does Jeme Brelin want a cheap drive controller? I
mean, really cheap. 

Since my last post to the list, MS Virtual PC 2004 has
appeared, and at $129 it is much cheaper than VMWare.
(The host OS must be XP Pro.) It is easy enough to
dual-boot XP with Linux, however, and much cheaper.

Personally, I do both.  It depends on the conversation.  If there's
something specific in a long message that I'm responding to, then I'll
quote just that section and bottom post.  That way when someone reads my
message they have a reference to what I'm talking about.

However, if the body of the message is something simple that all parties
are well aware of then there's no reason to bottom post, and in these
instances it's annoying to have to scroll through all the forwarding
gibberish to find the next person's comment.

[...]

And to take that a logical step further, it also depends on the
precedent. As much as I prefer to bottom post, if I'm replying to a
thread that is already top-posted, I'll follow suit regardless of my
personal preference. Much the same applies to maintenance programming -
if I'm debugging somebody else's code, I'll try to adher to whatever
style is already in effect when adding my own code. It's a matter of
readability.

Well, ESR notes the widely accepted method is to consistently
intersperse.  Just because you're only responding to one thing, make
it blatantly clear anyway.  Chop it down to exactly what you need
without destroying the context so people know exactly what you're
talking about.

A good text editor is key, unfortunately editors for Windows tend to
be lacking, and similarly unfortunate is Windows proliferation.  It's
like it gets close to functional but fails to complete the last 10%...

Another reason:  "Message Preview" view, which lists messages with a
snippet of the beginning of the message below the subject.  I've had
Outbreak users complain to me that my reponses had their quoted text
in the Preview instead of my response, because it's at the top.

> I send my responses back with each comment following the appropriate

Of course not.  They were too busy waiting for you to get a clue from
*their* example.  In my more paranoid moments, I believe there's a
secret BillyWare strategy to isolate its users from the competition by
constantly widening the communication gap between them and everyone
else.

First you cut 'em from the herd...

I'm still not happy with the service, but have learned at least one
thing that's helped: there's a firmware upgrade available for the
Actiontec modem that fixes its tendency to require powercycling
whenever a new dhcp client asks for an IP address.  The thing came
with version 1.60.10.0.69, and the Qwest folks had me upgrade to
1.60.10.0.71 on hearing my symptoms.

I'm still hoping to get this working as well as cable did, but it may
not matter.  My kids are definitely noticing the speed drop.  And
they're not gamers either.  They're into watching C-span's broadcasts
of Senate committee meetings and other stuff that, I figured, would be
dull enough at 9K....

Well, I have had someone tell they could not tell where my comments were
when I inserted comments, with lots of white space.

This led me to a few realizations:

1)  The person *expected* top posting, and is confused when he does not
see it.

2)  When I did not top-post his mail reader (Outlook, the company
standard) failed him.

#1 is interested, because all the arguments against top-posting, when it
seriously impacts, negatively, the communication.  Much of communication
is about the reception of the message *as is*, *not* the ability to
better read the message.

#2 is a big problem, especially when I spent 45 minutes editing
copy.....

I want to actually look at his computer and see what he described.  It
is scary.

Oh... I forgot about that.

I was at a place last summer that used Outlook and they had me check mail
on it a few times... and some messages had a very small print line (I
think it was just below the subject, but above the body?  Not certain.)
that read something like, "extra lines removed" or similar.  I found a
setting that turned off this "feature" and realized that they were
actually trimming whitespace in the message -- spaces AND line feeds.

Oh, man... that was just incredible.

So it could be that your lines were just crammed against those to which
you were responding or on which you were commenting.

Hi All,
A friend of mine just installed a dual boot system using RH9.0. Attached
is his problem. I've never tried a dual boot system so am unable to give
him a clue. Any ideas?

Thanks.

Steve Coffman

I installed Linux yesterday, that went with no problems now But.. 
After it was done it wanted to start the LILO boot loader. and all I saw
was LI . 
So I booted up with a w98 boot disk, and I ran fdisk /MBR; that fixed my
Windows XP
So is there an easy way to get the boot loader back?! 


I know that I should have made a bootdisk when it asked for it

That person was misguided and should have been steered towards

Outlook tends to do a bunch of things pretty poorly and nothing well,
so it's to be expected.

Considering everybody else's MUA works right, the logical conclusion

If you count MUA seats then Outlook style wins the vote and the logical 
conslusion is we should all change.

Nuts to that.

I got an Actiontec to replace a 678 that died on me a year or so ago.
I have it set up as just a simple bridge, so there is no firewalling or
even layer 3 ip information, other than the administrative interface,
configured in it. My ISP-provided ip address resides on the public
interface of my firewall.

It has worked fine like this, though I haven't touched it since I did
the initial configuration.

Good luck...

Looks like Lilo didn't get set up right.

Use a recover disk, knoppix, etc.

Boot using the root partition

somthing like...

linux root=/dev/partition

Fix lilo, rerun lilo

and reboot

repeat as needed until it's solved.

This is why I keep a Knoppix CD around. It's the best rescue CD ever.

The Red Hat 9 boot CD has a rescue mode. It's pretty lame as I recall, but it
will do.

The basic idea is to boot to rescue mode, mount the Linux partitions, and then
run the lilo utility using the -C switch (or chroot first) to reinstall LILO
in the MBR. You may want to edit the lilo.conf file first to specify the
"linear" option to the kernel. This is one possible fix for the "LI" problem.

Alternatively, you could switch to grub to fix the "LI" problem. I resisted
the lilo->grub migration for a long time but in the end it was worth the
switch, even though doing simple things like booting to single user mode is
more work than it ought to be.

The problem with Red Hat rescue mode is that it comes up with a sparsely
populated /dev directory. So you first have to create your own /dev entries
for /dev/hda, /dev/hda1, /dev/hda2 etc using the mknod utility. For that
you need to know the major and minor numbers. You can get those from another
Linux box if you have one around. Use "ls -l" in /dev to see the major and
minor numbers. If you don't have access to another Linux box then check back
with the list and we'll get those numbers for you.

This pretty much mangles plain text "lists" of items and it's a truly
horrible default.  I've run across lots of folks who wondered why so many
people started writing these run-together messages right after the
recipient had just upgraded to Office XP.  ;-)

Fortunately, the default can be changed-- but it only affects new messages
that arrive after it's changed.

Not that it's hard, in emacs just hit M-q; in pico it's C-j; etc.

Doh!  What an expensive mistake.  I'm amazed Clark Howard doesn't talk

you to call him on this).

Yes, but what a stupid default to have to start with.

Bill,

  Gnome may have a default size for all applications. I assume that you can
control the command line for launching it over Gnome as I can with Xfce.
The command line I have on my panel icon is "emacs -fn 10x20 -geometry
90x32+10+0". This tells the window manager to use the 10x20 font size and
make the window 90 char wide x 32 lines high with the position at 10,0.

HTH,

Rich

Looks like Comcast is hosed again.  ... oops, just came back.  It
seems to have been a relatively brief outage.  I see activity over the

13:30, :35 and :40.

Worked like a charm.  Emacs has been opening with the bottom of the

Message-ID: <200402232256.i1NMu5v29429@gate.daniloff.com>

Hello Linux folkz,
I have some questions regarding properties of SysV init daemon.
It starts on a system boot up by the kernel call to /sbin/init.
Then init reads /etc/inittab and starts/stops services in /etc/inint.d
After system has booted into default run level (e.g 5) init still
continues to run as a daemon.
Does it have any other purposes other than idling in the loop with
uid 1 and gid 0? 
Isn't it right that kernel itself takes care about parent processes
and its children?
Why do we need init running as a daemon after a system is running in
default runlevel? 
I can start and stop any service without init involved.
Could somebody please give me a pointer to the source of information
regarding all properties of init.

Thanks in advance,

Alex

No. init is the parent of all processes.

Because it may have to respawn processes.

It sounds as if you have a static IP?  If not, do you just run
dhcpcd/pump on your router's public interface to get the address?
This is certainly what I'd need to do (short of getting a static IP,
which I'm hoping to avoid paying for), but I haven't been able to get
the modem (in bridge mode) to pass the dhcp requests through.

Thanks,

That is what all links on the web say. 
What does it mean to be a parent of all processes?
How is it different if I start a process as a user? 
I'm looking for the full description of init functionality,
man init provides no information I'm looking for.
Could somebody please give me a hint where to find full info
on init functionality.

Thanks,

Alex

Try using the pstree program. This might give you 
a hint.

Update:  Everything is coming along nicely.  Here are a few facts
to log for posterity so far:

Debian Sarge netinst as of 2/21/2004 (testing distrib) worked great
on the install (drives the rj-45 but not the wireless) and installs
nicely from debian.oregonstate.edu.

X did not fare so well, however.  I had to upgrade to the unstable
version of xserver-xfree86, which is XFree86 4.3.0-2.

The symptom for the failed 4.2.1-12.1 seems to lie in the automatic 
detection of the right PCI address.  It would see 2 addresses for 
the devices but would end in the error:

   (WW) I810: No matching Device section for instance (BusID PCI:0:2:1) found
   (EE) No devices detected.

Note that this was in spite of my specifying:  BusID "PCI:0:2:0"
Thereby confusing my poor little brain.

After I upgraded to XFree86 4.3, I still had the problem of specifying
memory.  I'm still totally unclear on this point.  The specs say:

   Intel? 855GM Chipset Integrated Graphics 64MB (shared)

But, the XFree86 log tells me that there's a total of 12288 kb 
allocated to it and 3964 kByte of "Pre-allocated VideoRAM".  So, 
I have no clue what I'm supposed to have VideoRam set to.

Anyway, on to the sound setup!

Has anyone had experience configuring Asterisk to handle a fax server?  
(Like HylaFAX?)

I need something that can handle multiple outbound faxes based on 
available lines.  Combining something like HylaFAX and Asterisk seems like 
it would work, but I am not certain.

  I just built and installed octave-2.1.55 and have a Slackware-9.1 package
available. It's 41.4M in size (gack!).

  "GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving
linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other
numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with
Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.

  "Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra
problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary
functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary differential
and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily extensible and
customizable via user-defined functions written in Octave's own language, or
using dynamically loaded modules written in C++, C, Fortran, or other
languages."

  If you want the package let me know off the list and I'll see if I can put
it -- temporarily -- on my ftp server at aracnet.

It came up on the Debian mailing lists that HylaFAX doesn't see a lot
of development anymore. mgetty-fax was suggested as a replacement. I
don't have any direct experience with either.

That said, this is something I'd *love* to play with. ;-) ;-)

BTW-None of this is to disuade you from using HylaFAX if it meets your

A bit more information, since I'm making progress: I've managed to ssh
into my network in spite of the Actiontec.

Turning the thing into a simple bridge didn't work for me.  Apparently
it does if you have a static IP address, but dhcpcd wasn't able to
work across the modem.  There may be a way to make it work, but I
haven't found it.  That would be ideal, though.

Instead what I did was to turn on the "DMZ" feature, which causes the
modem to forward all ports to my firewall/router.  I then add a rule
on my router to forward port 22 on inside the network.  One additional
change was needed because I'm using shorewall, which in its default
configuration rejects packets on eth0 that don't conform to rfc 1918
(which specifies ranges of legal IP addresses for internet traffic.)
The internal address that the Actiontec was giving my incomming
packets ran afoul of this rule, so I had to remove it.

The only remaining problem is letting the world know what IP address
I've been assigned.  I've written a script that uses snarf and sed to
get it from the Actiontec's http interface, but still haven't managed
to get ez-ipupdate working across the Actiontec.  So as an interim
I've set up a cron job to periodically fail to connect to an unlikely
port on a machine whose logs I have access to.  When Qwest changes my
IP address while I'm away from home I can check those logs to see
where my machine has recently come in from.  Yuck -- but it works. :-)

I'm still hoping to improve this thing, and appreciate all the help so
far.

Subject: [PLUG] Disk footprint on fresh install...
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0402240419301.434@shaft.bitmine.net>

So, someone was going on the other day about distribution choices to fit
in small spaces.

I wasn't going for small-as-possible, but I did trim stuff that I was
certain would never be needed on this system in a pinch (the compilers,
for example, were removed, as well as alternate shells and editors --
however, vim was substituted for nvi and gawk for mawk and a few other
little personal idiosyncracies).

Anyway, I rebuilt my NFS server tonight (from "What the hell is wrong with
my NFS server?" to "Oh, hell... that's just totally screwed up and should
probably just be rebuilt as a Debian system." to "OK... all works now" in
1.5 hours... that includes the troubleshooting and trying to make it
better... and it's only a P166).

Anyway... here's the skinny:

snowman:~# df -m
Filesystem           1M-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda1                 2041       169      1873   9% /
/dev/md0                 14668      6323      8345  44% /export
snowman:~# du -ms /*|sort -n
du: `/proc/249/fd/4': No such file or directory
0       /vmlinuz
1       /cdrom
1       /dev
1       /floppy
1       /home
1       /initrd
1       /mnt
1       /opt
1       /root
1       /tmp
2       /boot
2       /etc
3       /bin
3       /sbin
18      /lib
42      /var
65      /proc
85      /usr
6403    /export

/export is my NFS export tree... so that doesn't count.
/var contains the Debian package database and dpkg listings (no Non-Free
or Non-US in sources.list -- just main contrib and security updates).

Now, here's the REALLY interesting bit.

snowman:~# du -ms /usr/*|sort -n
1       /usr/X11R6
1       /usr/doc
1       /usr/games
1       /usr/include
1       /usr/info
1       /usr/local
1       /usr/src
3       /usr/sbin
10      /usr/bin
15      /usr/lib
60      /usr/share

Crazy, huh?

Turns out vim is a good chunk of that /usr/share, but most of it is
/usr/share/doc and /usr/share/locale.

Anyway, just info for the curious.

Actually, I think it was Alan Flavell who noticed that Outlook is
actually doing the right thing.  The cursor needs to start at the top
of the quoted material SO THAT YOU CAN TRIM IT as you go down through
it to answer the email with interspersed comments.

What happened though is that a culture grew up around the "cursor is
at the top, so replies go at the top" mistaken impression of this
feature.

This is the mistake.  Not what Outlook does.

Nice of you to attribute good intentions to the Outlook designers.  
But when you have a default signature file that is also inserted at
the beginning of the email, indicating that your whole reply belongs up
there.  

Outlook also has the braindead behavior of not being able to insert
quote indicators of any type without needing to re-spell check the quoted
material.

In my Debian installation of IceWM the F1 key is bound to invoking a help system.
Unfortunately the "default action" that goes with this is broken.

The binding isn't in the .icewm/preferences file or in the /etc/X11/icewm/* files.

Anyone know:
   what the default action is and where I can change the behavior of the F1 key?

This is blocking launching help on programs with built in help.

Bill,

  Yup. You can see an example at <http://www.octave.org/>.

  Perhaps later today I'm going to see how it does with MatLab plug-ins.
There are a couple of Type-2 fuzzy set creators/operators with which I'd

This is a combined Science Fiction / Linux convention.  I went last
year; it was interesting, and while it was mostly regional there were 
interesting people from all over the eastern U.S.  Those travelling
through Detroit for other reasons should consider it.

Check out the GNU Octave Repository and Matlinks for two decent
collections of F.O.S.S. Octave/MATlab scripts. Both are fairly
impressive for a corner of the world that typically doesn't embrace open
source software. There will likely never be as broad a selection of '.m'
scripts freely available as can be purchased, but these two projects are
a nice start.

The way that outlook quotes, with the pseudo-headers and the four line

tell the editor to put the quoted text at the top and put the cursor
on the first letter.  Outlook's behavior is wrong.

Chris,

  I've been using R for years, particularly with GRASS.

  Octave is the only source I've found for calculating the eigenvector and
associated principal eigenvalue for a symmetric matrix. If you know of
another algorithm (in C, java or pseudocode) please let me know. I've looked
without finding anything.

  Sigh. Doesn't it always work this way? While I've spent too much time
digging in dusty, ill-lit corners of the Web looking for algorithms and code
for the above, it never occurred to me to look on my own system. Turns out
that both GRASS and R have functions. The latter is designed more for
spectral decomposition of a matrix while the former is just what I've been
seeking. Turns out it was in the image processing section and I've not done
that with GRASS for quite a few years. Who can afford satellite scenes? Not
I or my clients!

Excelsior!

I recently installed ircd hybrid version 7. I have read that this is a
good piece of software for hosting your own irc server. I found that the
software is not that user friendly and that the documentation is
lacking. 

I have a feeling that I see this as the case not because it is the truth
but because of my inexperience with such software. 

If anyone would like to give me some advice that would be great. A
couple links would be nice also. 

or maybe just maybe some words of encouragement.

You can do it!  I know you can.  I have faith in you.  Just take it one
step at a time and you'll do just fine.  Try, try, and try again.  If at
first you don't succeed, try and try again.  I think I can I think I can

Cooper,

  Ah, this looks so much like Israeli society (and I lived there in the
mid-1980s so I can write from experience). Get 3 Israelis together to
discuss politics and before you know it you have 5 opinions and 6 new
political parties. Can everyone be satisfied? Nah! But, some folks will do
their own thing regardless.

  Think you can turn this into a daytime TV soap opera?

I have more experience with ircd servers than I want. And they all
suck. Documentation, source, all of it. The least sucky of them all,
I've found, after "all these years" is Bahamut, which is used by
DAL.net:

http://bahamut.dal.net/

Then if you want to be cool, you need to get ircservices:

I'm running Fedora Core 1, fully patched. When I try to start mysqld
with the "service" command, it starts, but reports that it failed:

  service mysqld start
  Timeout error occurred trying to start MySQL Daemon.
  Starting MySQL:                              [FAILED]

It seems that it is running however:

  service mysqld status
  mysqld (pid 4632) is running...

and...

  ps -A
  4608 pts/0    00:00:00 safe_mysqld
  4632 pts/0    00:00:00 mysqld

I am able to log into mysql and access tables and data.

Any idea as to why it starts, but reports that it failed?

-Scott

Scott,

  Do you get the same failure if you run the command, 'service mysqld start'
after having explicitly stopped the process?

Yes, it fails to start after "service mysqld stop" as well as "killall

Well, Alex, when two processes love each other very much, they have
child processes. How they actually do this is something your mother can
explain to you.

Okay, kidding aside. Let's say you open a terminal window. To the system
this means that it needs to launch a process called "bash." If you run a
program inside the shell, say, "vi," then "vi" will be a subprocess--or
child process of the original "bash" process. The "bash" process is
thought to be the "parent" process.

All the processes on a running system's process tree eventually leads to
'init.' the parent of all processes.

To make this clearer, run this command in a linux terminal:

  ps -ef --forest

All kidding asside, I hope this helps!

Scott,

   Hmm-m-m. Don't know if mysql lets root start it, but postgresql doesn't.
The postmaster must be started by user 'postgres', or whatever you named the
user when the application was installed and configured.

Rob is on the right track here. In the mysql init.d file installed
by Fedora, the server is first started and then a test is
run to see if the server is running.  This test required
a username that was not supplied in the originally installed 
init.d script. This is discussed in this bug report
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=108779
There is a new init.d script for mysql here
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=95652&action=view
that fixes the problem.

thanks for the links. The documentation is much better with this
project. Still no luck getting it to work though. I think I need to find
something a little bit less challenging then having my own irc server.
It is not like I have anyone I would chat with anyway. I just kind of
wanted to see if I could get it to work. I know now that this is just
not in my capability's at the moment. Maybe after a couple more years of
messing around with the computer I will come back to this project. Maybe
by then I will have a good reason to have my own irc server. 

I don't know.

	Hi everyone, I am in the process of trying to set up a webserver for 
me and some friends to use. I currently have K12LTSP linux installed 
(The distro used at my school) with apache (with perl, php, mysql, 
etc...), ftpd, and with no gui. I'm fairly comfortable in the terminal, 
and with editing config files. So far i have gotten apache to host 
users public_html folders and have started to try and get virtualhosts 
set up for several domain names. I'd like to give each user a private 
and public ftp account so they can upload files for personal storage 
and also host small files for friends to access. If anyone can help me 
get this set up or provide me with hints/suggestions/nudges in the 
right direction, I'd be most grateful. In addition, would anyone be 
kind enough to tell me if there is a more suitable linux distribution 
or if there are any front-end gui programs to configure apache and 
ftpd?

Thanks for any help!

Feel free to reply either in the PLUG lists or at my email (joshyaganeh

You can use webmin. It runs on your server at port 10000. You don't need
a GUI on the server that way, it's all run through your browser.

As far as a distro goes, it's all good AFIK for something like a web
server. Apache is great software.

Webmin is on most of the RH and FC1 CDs I have, but you can download it,
too. I do not recall the site, though.

Yes, any of the more mainstream general purpose distros will likely 
serve your purposes quite well and be a more pleasant system to work 
with for learning purposes. I recommend Debian, but Fedora, Mandrake, 
Slackware, and SuSE are all good options. K12LTSP is an excellent distro 
for it's purposes, but is pretty specialized. Since K12LTSP is Redhat 
based you might be most comfortable with Fedora, or possibly Mandrake.

As for gui configuration programs, there are a few options out there. 
Check out webmin, it's a web based frontend for configuring a number of 
things, including Apache.

As for ftp, don't. Unless you have a really pressing need to use ftp 
there are better options. FTP is horribly insecure, it's also generally 
slower than HTTP. Learn all about SSH and the things you can do with it 
including scp and sftp. And for serving files to the general public do 
it through Apache.

If you need it, make sure to lock it down, dictating usernames, times of
day, subnets allowed, everything you can. Be very certain to disallow
anonymous FTP if at all possible.

My 2 cents, anyway.

There's always HTTP put.

But seriously... ftp is bad news.  You just shouldn't use it period.

It's not like it's even EASIER than anything else.  For those old dogs
that want to use it because they know it, it's time to learn a new trick.
The new people won't know the difference.

Message-ID: <20040225094718.GA4335@gate.kl-ic.com>

I burn a lot of Knoppix disks.  I recently bought two more burners,
and now have two CDR drives on one machine, and one on another.

Some observations:

1) Use the fine-pitch or round ATA100 cables to connect to the CDR
   drive.  With a 48X drive, it goes twice as fast as the older
   style large-pitch ATA33 IDE cables.

2) Do not share the cable connection for two CDR drives.  Use a
   separate IDE socket and cable for each drive.  cdrecord runs
   a LOT slower (10X) if it is talking to two drives over one cable.

These may be obvious, but I bet some of you have the wrong cabling in
your machines.  I did until I fixed it.

BTW, two 52X CDR drives seem to work just about as fast as a single
drive, on a 1.8GB P4 / ATA133 / Rambus machine.  I wonder how many
drives and IDE controllers one could stuff in a Linux box before it
started slowing down?

If K12LTSP is based on Red Hat 9, then you'll want to install the
vsftpd package. As ftp daemons go, it can be made relatively secure.

Then have a look at the files in /usr/share/doc/vsftpd-1.1.3,
especially the FAQ. It should get you started in the right direction.

Still a student, eh? So naive. :-) This is the sort of question that
starts flame wars. You're inviting everyone to stand up and shout MY
DISTRO IS BEST at the top of their lungs.

If you're familiar with K12LTSP, then stick with it, at least for a
while. It'll work fine while you concentrate on getting your web
server running correctly. Once you're content with that, then you'll
be in a better postition to migrate to a different distribution, if
that's what you want.

And here's my two cents of advice: Know yourself first.

The trick is less to find the "best" distribution and more to find the
one that matches your skills, goals, and hardware.

I run three distributions at home -- Red Hat (my workstation), Debian
(my wife's workstation), and Gentoo (our mail/web server) -- and I
manage a bunch of Red Hat and Fedora machines at work. Each
distribution has some unique strengths, and each presents some special
demands.

There isn't a right distribution; there are only trade-offs, and you
have to figure out how *you* fit into the mix.

You could do the math... 33MHz, 32-bit PCI bus... you'll run in to a
slowdown when you saturate the PCI bus.

With DMA enabled on the drives, they certainly don't eat a lot of CPU
while burning.  However, you need to be able to feed them data fast
enough so as to not incur buffer underruns.  If you're burning off a
single hard disk to fifteen CD-R drives, you'll find your hard disk
cannot feed that many drives fast enough.  Again, you could probably do
a little math... I think the faster (consumer-grade) hard drives out
there are able to sustain around 30MB/sec read speeds.

Aside from actual hardware speed limitations, I'm not sure where any
software bottlenecks would occur... especially if you're using 2.6.

My two cents...

Do it if you must.... but in addition to what others have said... here
is my two cents on FTP.

FTP is going away.  As others have stated, it is slow and it is
insecure.  FTP clients are disappearing.  Most Windoze users only have
two FTP clients on their computers; the command-line BSD FTP program and
their web browser.  Neither is meant to be a fully featured FTP client.

I think there are HTTP-based apache mods that can be used to easily
allow users to upload files.  There was some discussion about this a few
weeks ago on this list.  I see no reason this couldn't be tunneled over
SSL to be a bit more secure.

Really, though, look in to what ssh provides you.  Make sure you disable
telnet if you haven't already.  Start using ssh.  It'll provide you with
scp access... if the users are running linux at home, they can scp files
as easily as cp'ing them.  Otherwise, they can grab scp.exe from the
Putty download page and still scp files as easily as copying them.

It's secure, it's safe, it's faster....

My two cents...   :-)

They may. People designing web pages with 
Microsoft Front Page may have to use FTP -
unless Microsoft has added webdav in recent versions.

Since, AFAIK, freegeek doesn't give out anything less than PII these
days, I thought I'd give people here a shot at a computer before they
recycled it:

It's a dual PentiumPro 200 with 512K cache on a Providence mainboard
  (the best PPro's Intel made, short of the Baby Xeons ["PII
  Overdrive?" Whatever marketing called it])

It's got .... a hard drive.
It's got .... RAM ... it's RAM is pretty obscure, and last I remember
  we filled it out reasonably well. Maybe as much as 384MB?
It has onboard Ethernet and SE Ultrawide Dual SCSI

I'll collect replies and after a "reasonable amount of time" give it
to the "most worthy cause". If no one responds, it'll (sadly) go to
freegeek where I suspect they'll trash it.

Oh, and I can not drive it anywhere as I don't drive. I live close to
Beaverton Transit Center. I might be cajoled into hauling it to
another MAX station, though.

Before you despair, you might want to give this irc server a look:
http://www.tr-ircd.net/.  For just a casual perusal of the documentation pages,
it seems that each option is well commented.  It wouldn't hurt to give it a
look.

thanks for the links. The documentation is much better with this

It is not like I have anyone I would chat with anyway. I just kind of
wanted to see if I could get it to work. I know now that this is just
not in my capability's at the moment. Maybe after a couple more years of
messing around with the computer I will come back to this project. Maybe
by then I will have a good reason to have my own irc server.

I don't know.

A curious test would be to place a couple drives in a couple
firewire/ieee1394 enclosures and see performance.  I am betting the
overall write time would be the same, maybe slower, but performance and
scalability would go up.

Actually, as far as I know, only Pentium 1 machines slower than 200MHz 
are being recycled immediately.  Everything higher than that goes to 
some use (if the computer works).  At the very least, most of the 
parts would be reused.  NICs, video cards, hard drives, RAM etc. are 
rarely thrown away.  SCSI drives are definitely kept.

I work (more or less) at FreeGeek now and I'll ask about this.  I'll 
ping the people in receiving.

Best,
Kyle

Use DAV instead of FTP. If you have to run Windows you can set up a 'Web
Folder' and drag and drop files. If you use KDE you can use ssh
tinulling via the fish: scheme, if you can't get davfs working so you
can simply mount DAV 'shares'.

Actually, in newish versions KDE, konquerer knows how to handle
webdav:// and webdavs:// URLs without assistance.

MacOS X can do WebDAV very well, too.

And then there's the WebDAV Linux filesystem (davfs), which allows you
to mount a WebDAV directory as part of the local filesystem:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/dav/

If you go the WebDAV route, then my suggestion is to disable http://
connections, and only allow https:// to the WebDAV tree. At that
point, you can start to trust the passwords that appear on the wire.

Okay.

I'd still honestly, like to get it to someone from PLUG who has a

them and get their response.

I bought a USB enclosure for a used laptop hard drive that I have, and
the thing works great!  However, when I read through /var/log/messages
I found this:

I also see this during startup and shutdown.

The laptop doesn't have a floppy drive, and there's nothing

I've been asking questions recently about setting up my Qwest DSL

Since, AFAIK, freegeek doesn't give out anything less than PII these
days, I thought I'd give people here a shot at a computer before they
recycled it:

It's a dual PentiumPro 200 with 512K cache on a Providence mainboard
  (the best PPro's Intel made, short of the Baby Xeons ["PII
  Overdrive?" Whatever marketing called it])

It's got .... a hard drive.
It's got .... RAM ... it's RAM is pretty obscure, and last I remember
  we filled it out reasonably well. Maybe as much as 384MB?
It has onboard Ethernet and SE Ultrawide Dual SCSI

I'll collect replies and after a "reasonable amount of time" give it
to the "most worthy cause". If no one responds, it'll (sadly) go to
freegeek where I suspect they'll trash it.

Oh, and I can not drive it anywhere as I don't drive. I live close to
Beaverton Transit Center. I might be cajoled into hauling it to
another MAX station, though.

proftpd might all the control you want, but it reintroduces the orignal
problem in a bigger way. proftpd has a rather bad track record with
respect to security holes. Though not even close to IE, I've seen too
many alerts with proftpd.

  Something to consider is ncFTPd. The server software is not free ($99 for
up to 50 simultaneous users), but he has the finest ftp client I've seen
(I've used it for years). Support your open source developer!

It's probably coming from inside the kernel, or maybe from the hotplug agent.
In any case something is requesting a load of the floppy module. Then the
floppy module complains because it can't find a floppy drive.

Try putting this line in your /etc/modules.conf file:

    alias floppy off

Then anything that requests a load of the floppy module will get nothing.

  Better yet -- and I had not seen this before -- is that you can install,
run and use the system legitimately for no cost if you have 3 or fewer
simultaneous users. It is enabled automatically when you run with
max-users=3 or less.

This is surprising. Figure 1x CD is 150KB/s, 52x is less than 8MB/s.
Even four CD writers should be possible for a single ATA33 channel. This
could well be a kernel weakness or a cdrecord weakness, you're highly
unlikely to strain the capacity of the channel (though IDE is known for
limitations with multiple drives).

Note that there is no point in going for good cabling for CD drives, as
two drives (the IDE limit) can't even come close to saturating a channel
(though DVD burners may change this). Looking at the ENU web pages,
better than 75% of the drives were listed as ATA33, and only 2 drives
mentioned being able to handle ATA66.

Writing? Sure, maintaining 8MB/s reading, 16MB/s writing is darn near
trivial (and note these speeds are only when writing the outer edge). As
Rob mentioned, PCI bandwidth is going to be a big issue. Most on
motherboard IDE controllers never hit the main PCI bus. So if you're
doing mass duplication, I could see running 17 drives at once. Connect
one drive to the spare motherboard channel, then hang 16 drives off the
main PCI bus. Figure that the 8MB/s is only the maximum drives will do
though. Stagger when drives start writing and you'll be able to get more
drives. More than 22 drives should be possible on a standard motherboard.

You're going to saturate your source, though... unless it's all cached
in RAM or something.

I thought onboard IDE controllers were hitting the PCI bus.  Although,
there was a change in the way southbridge controllers worked a few years
ago with all this 'HyperTransport' garbage.  Perhaps that's when these
things were pulled off the PCI bus.  I wouldn't trust it to always not
hit the PCI bus, however...

OK... here's the deal.

I've got amavis (amavisd-new) calling spamassassin (while amavis itself is
called by postfix).

amavis is catching and holding some spam in /var/lib/amavis/virusmails
(along with the virus stuff flagged by clamav).  And the spam messages in
there are clearly marked as spam with the regular spamassassin headers
(X-Spam-Status: etc.).

The weird bit is that when the message PASSES, there are no spam headers
at all.  I think amavis is stripping them out before passing the message
back to postfix.

I need them headers!  I want to find out WHY so much spam is still getting
through to see which weights need adjusting.

Any ideas?

Oh... and I really want to see if bayesian filtering is actually working
on this installation... is there a way to know for sure?

If you get the headers, spamassassin lists bayes results.

BTW-I wouldn't change the weights. I'd play with the threshold. Also,
see here:

for some really, really effective add-on rules.

OK... I'm getting none (in the caught messages, for which I DO have
headers).  Weird.

Oh, there are some crazy weights... the default installation I have here
(from an older version distributed in Woody) has an IN_REP_TO check that
weighs down -4.431 just for having an In-Reply-To header.  That's probably
90% of the spam that still gets through (with a threshold of 5).

I'll look, thanks.

However... I still don't know why amavis is stripping the X-Spam headers
and now I don't know why bayesian filterings not doing anything.

In your /etc/amavisd.conf file what do you have for the
$sa_tag_level_deflt setting? I had to set mine to -999 to get it to add
the spamassassin headers to mail not caught as spam.

Chuck Mize, you're my hero.

A beverage on me.... but I reserve the right to refuse if I'm dead poor
(which is frequent -- but the refusal is void if I have a non-free
beverage myself and you can punch me in the stomach if I've ordered myself
food and claim I can't buy you one).

Yes. If you can afford 22+ CD-writers how much memory can you afford (I
figure 1GB isn't a lot nowadays)? Also if you're writing to 22+ drives at
once, likely you aren't writing different images to each of them so after
the first copy it will be in memory, and most hard drives could likely
handle reading 3 images at once.

Read the specifications, this is the case. A single ATA133 can in theory
completely saturate 32-bit/33MHz PCI by itself, once you've got dual
channels (like all modern motherboards) you're dead. The change is that
few northbridge-southbridge pairs use PCI between them anymore; VIA has
some proprietary bus that looks like PCI to software, but actually does
533MB/s; both nVidia and ALi are using HyperTransport between north and
south bridges. Interestingly ALi has a license for the P4 bus, but they're
still using HT (meaning with their northbridge you could hook up nVidia's
southbridge to a P4). The use of HT, and removing the memory controller
from the northbridge makes it interesting because you could in theory
hook two HT northbridges together in series, and have two AGP slots.

Anyway, back to the main issue. Though the IDE controllers are still on
the southbridge, and might appear to logically be on the main PCI bus
they aren't in reality. They're hooked to whatever bus is used, and that
will be significantly more than 133MB/s (and likely not interfering with
the main peripheral bus).

Does hdparm -t count as sustained?

# hdparm -t /dev/hdb

/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  154 MB in  3.00 seconds =  51.30 MB/sec

The read rate is around 55MB/sec if i don't have the partitions mounted.

Just curious,

No, I don't think so...

I really don't know why, though.

Try copying a few gigs of /dev/zero onto the disk and see how fast it
goes.  Real-life benchmarks are what really counts... maybe copy an ISO
from one disk to another.

Aaron has hit the nail on the head here.  I've seen people working with
message preview mode; you've got to state your business in the first
line of your message or your message doesn't get read.

Also, top posting is far easier to work with if you have a preview pane
open.  I use Evolution with the preview pane.  I click on a message in
the message list; the message appears in the preview pane.  The writer
of the message has 2-3 seconds to interest me in the reading the
message, so they better get to the point in the first few lines.  If
it's not interesting, one click on down arrow key and it's on to the
next message. If their grand prose is posted down so far it doesn't
appear in the preview pane, their message doesn't stand a chance.

I use Evolution, with the preview pane, in fact I read all my email in
the preview pane, it does have a scroll bar.  The thing about quoting,
is if the message is more than a few lines, you should trim it so people
know what you are responding to, and done't have to scroll down 6 pages
to find your message.  Expecting them to read the whole message is
silly, so quoting the whole message is almost always a waste of disk
space, though I'm sure your hardware vendor does not mind.

On the other hand if you are too lazy to trim the quoted material you
really do have to top post, or nobody will every find your comments.

I don't use M$ anything, but I top post for the same reason.  And I hate 
bottom posting for the same reason.  I like a top post line that gets me 
then inline answers.

This is my fault for using a cute subject line.

I actually do have a USB floppy, but it isn't plugged in while I'm getting
those error messages during startup, shutdown or when plugging in another
USB peripheral.  So if I forbid it from working I won't be able to use
the floppy when I need it.

I think the problem may have to do with the /etc/updfstab.conf file
and system.

Then you include the entire message, so I don't know exactly what reason
that is, unless I read the whole message.  If I cared enough I might do
that.

To immediately revert a single message back to its original form, click on
the yellow "i" bar just above the From: line that says something like
"This message has had extra line breaks removed.  To restore, click here".

To make the setting permanent for all new messages that come in, use:

Tools -> Options -> Preferences -> E-Mail Options

uncheck the box labelled "remove extra line breaks in plain text
messages".

Keep in mind that all the previously received messages will continue to be
mangled, but new ones should look OK.

That's ridiculous! Windows XP can only do desktop paging through a
third-party tool or a "power tool" supplied by Microsoft. But *every*
window manager I have ever used in Linux includes a desktop pager. Argh!

Now 30MB/s seems fast! With tiobench, sequential reads peak at 22MB/s
and average about 15. Random reads are around 500KB/s (ick!) and the
writes are similar. I was using the machine at the time, so the numbers
are low, but I don't know by how much.

Oh, but let us not forget that they are most likely planning ahead. I'm
sure Longhorn will include a few ideas pulled from the various Linux
Desktop Environments and apps. Virtual Desktops, Pop-up blocker, tabbed

Well, fortunately, Microsoft thinks the design they're working on now
will still be competitive 16 months from now, I'd be surprised if the
next version of Windows offers anything more than drool-proofing to
the point where it insults an idiot's intelligence and another $300
price tag.

Message-ID: <20040227061433.36849.qmail@web14607.mail.yahoo.com>


Hi, all:

I am installing the RH9 now. As it uses MySQL 3.25.??, I am going to update MySQL into 4.0.25. 

According to RH document,  perl and php all dynamicly link to the MySQL 3.25 lib. So I have to install mysql-4.0.15-compact.rpm too, which installs both 3.25 and 4.0 libs in there for not breaking the php, perl and etc, links. 

My question is how can I link php or perl to the new libs (MySQL 4.0)? 

I hear that the reason that RH uses dynamic link is to save space, does anyone know that which Linux is easy to update?

Thanks.

Mike

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0402270709080.3087-100000@uplinknetworks.dyndns.org>

I have a client that has an IMAP server running on an NT box.  They want
to migrate to Linux so I've setup an IMAP server on Linux.  They'd like
mail to be delivered to both servers for the time being so users can get
used to checking email on the Linux server, but still feel confident that
their mail is working.
Any ideas how to do this?  Fetchmail on the Linux box pulling from the NT
box maybe?  Is there some other way to magically deliver mail to both
boxes simultaneously?
Thanks,
~M

Matt,

  I'm not a SysAdmin so I probably don't understand the problem. Why should
the users even know on what machine or OS the mail server is running? If
it's a matter of becoming used to a new MUA, then that's separate from the
MTA behind it. If they are using winduhs MUA offering, cannot that get mail
from the linux box directly?

Puzzled,

Rich

In Outlook the users will have two IMAP servers configured.  One for the
NT server and one for the Linux server.  The owner of the company wants
mail delivered to both servers so users will see the same messages in each
IMAP setup.  This is just a temporary configuration so the owner and the
users can feel confident that the Linux IMAP server is functioning exactly
like the NT IMAP server.  We'll then let it run like this for a couple
weeks and then delete the Outlook configuration for the NT IMAP server and
use only the Linux IMAP server.

Matt,

  Oh. Wow. I would think that a few test messages sent to the owner and
employees via the linux server would demonstrate that the back end makes no
difference. But, I guess you're dealing with other issues there and this is
only a manifestation of them.

  Looks like the kind of non-rational attitudes with which I have to deal
when I step through the looking glass into RegulatoryLand.

Good luck!

If I had a nickle for every time "it should just work" and it didn't I'd
have a couple of bucks.  When dealing with a situation where errors
might go undetected and such an error could have grave consequences (a
important email lost with no indication) I think it is prudent to use
this kind of double checking.

There's no way I know of to get SMTP to do this even with 
DNS tricks. The obvious solution is for the receiving MTA to 
send a copy of incoming messages to the other MTA but this 
proves nothing. If one of the MTAs misbehaves, how do you 
interpret the results? Which MTA "failed"?

I think the suggestion that Rich made about switching to 
Linux and sending test messages is a better one. However, 
instead of sending a few messages, a program can be written 
(that runs at another site) that sends numerous messages to 
all the users in the company - some with attachments, some 
with multiple recipients, etc. The results would be more 
meaningful, the experiment better controlled, and the 
results less open to interpretation. You could repeat the 
test with the NT server if the owner of the company needs a 
comparison.

If messages are so important that grave consequences result 
from one of the being missed, something other than e-mail 
should be used to communicate the information.

  Oooh! Spam and viruses!! Leave the server on the 'Net unprotected for a
couple of hours and you'll get your flood of test messages. :-)

There's a brief user story of why he had his department switched over to

Hmm. I should have asked the larger question:

After mail is received by Postfix, what happens? Is it stored in a
local /var/mail spool? Is it delivered to a home directory? Is it
forwarded via smtp to the Windows box running the imap daemon?

Currently only the NT box is receiving mail.  On the Linux box, received
mail is stored in /var/spool/mail.  WU-IMAP then handles it from there.

No...  Postfix is only on the Linux box.  The NT box is running some IMAP
software I've never heard of.

I'm missing something. Inbound messages are received by Postfix
running on the Linux box, right? How do they get to the imap server
running on the NT box?

FWIW, IMHO...

UW-IMAP pretty much is one of the worst IMAP servers out there.  I used
it for a few years, however, without any major problems.  When I set up
SquirrelMail, I ran into a few issues I ran past the SM devs.  The first
thing they ask is "what IMAP server are you using?" ... I told them
uw-imapd.  They proceeded to rant for a bit about how crappy an IMAP
server that is.

If the users are going to leave mail on the server, uw-imap will start
slowing down as mailboxes get large (a few thousand messages).  If users
have things in their home directories, uw-imap will scan them.  IME,
some IMAP clients won't differentiate between non-mailboxes and
mailboxes in a user's home directory when using uw-imap.

Since you're starting from scratch, essentially, I'd suggest going with
Maildir (which is faster than mbox, especially for larger mail folders)
and a different IMAP server.  I, personally, like bincimap, but it is
young.  There's that new one... its name starts with an A... Avion? 
Something like that... that people seem to like, but the bincimap
developer didn't like their development style.

Postfix has support for Maildir, as does procmail.

Just my two cents...  :-)

What does the NT box use as a MTA, however?

IMAP/POP3 - Ways the MUAs access mail, they don't actually do the
sending of mail, though.

Some servers integrate IMAP, POP3, and SMTP into a single setup, but
they rarely identify such things as 'IMAP Servers' ... I really don't
like that idea, personally.  I like keeping things modularized.  :-)

What is listening on port 25 of the NT box?

There is here an unfortunately gap in the terminology.  I have seen once
or twice the term "Mail Presentation Agent" for the layer between mail
store and MUA, but it is not in wide use.

I like it.  If we all start using it, it will become the standard,
allowing us to say things like:

The MTA sent it to the LDA which stored it in the spool for the MPA to
fetch for the MUA.

Hmmm... since the LDA is 'local' ... could the POP3/IMAP server be the
RDA instead of the MPA?

Inbound messages are currently sent to the NT box running some software
that both receives the mail and runs imap.

They want to switch to Linux.  Currently no mail is being delivered to the
Linux box.  I have Postfix and uw-imap configured, but I can use any imap
server.

They've successfully connected to the Linux server using Outlook, but they
were hoping to be able to test both servers simultaneously by having
messages sent to both, but this may not be possible.

It's possible; you just haven't provided enough information yet for us
to figure out how. :-)

Here's the next question. Leaving aside the question of the imap
folders (which we know live on the NT box), where does a user's main
inbox reside? Is it on the Linux box (presumably in /var/mail) or the
NT box?

If the inbox resides on the NT box, what Postfix configuration
directive is used to let Postfix know that inbound messages are not
delivered locally but forwarded on to the NT box?

Well, it doesn't remotely deliver--I think "deliver" implies an active
sender and a passive (or at least waiting) receiver.  "Agent" might not
be the best term either, since a defined mailbox format is itself part
of the layer.  Throwing in lots of terminology where there was none is
somewhat tedious, so I'd rather avoid proposing both "Mail Presentation
Agent" as a subset of "Mail Presentation Layer".  Maybe sticking with
"Layer" is the best approach.

Hmmm...  OK, let's start over.  Ignore the Linux box at the moment.  Mail
comes into the NT box.  Users connect to the NT box from Outlook using
IMAP.  All their incoming mail is on the NT box in whatever format that
particular program uses.

Now...  they want to replace the NT mailserver with a Linux box that does
the same thing.  I've setup a Linux box running Postfix and uw-imap.  We
configured a few Outlook clients to successfully connect to the Linux
server.  The owner was hoping to have mail delivered from the Internet to
both boxes simultaneously.  Then he could verify that both servers
function the same before switching over completely to Linux.

That's not the point, I believe.  What he's trying to get is:

  Have NT now
  Want Linux soon

  How can I perform parallel operations so the user community trusts the new stuff?

i.e., ideally he'd like a particular piece of email to be delivered to
both email servers in a quasi-identical manner so the users can connect
to NT box and go "Yup, there's my familiar email." and then connect to
the Linux box and go "Golly, there it is too.  That Linux thing is OK
after all."

Now I don't see a way for this to happen without some additional piece
to be involved that would forward the email from the NT box to the Linux
box after it has gone through the normal delivery to the MTA routine.

Consider if this were an accounting system you'd have the data entry 
clerks input the same information into both system and then run reports
to verify the same balances were derived.

Arrrgh! You said that mail was being received by Postfix! Now you're
saying that mail is really being received by some (unknown) software
on the NT box?

I want to help, but the information you're giving is maddeningly
incomplete.

So, I want to know ... If I send a message to someone at yourclient.com,
what is the *exact* path it takes to get to someone's inbox? I want to
know every machine and every piece of software in the mix.

Dear all:

I am trying to scp a directory from a linux box (RH9) to a solaris box.
I have both OpenSSH 3.7 and OpenSSH 1.2.3 installed.  I thought

1.2.3).
So I have scp1 in my path but I still get this FATAL error below.
Am I still missing something?

Is the Solaris box running openssh too?  Or might it be running the 
commercial version?  If so you have a compatibility problem. The
workaround is to:

  scp -r  files_director/ userx at machine1:/home/
  ssh solaris_box 'scp -r /home/ files_director/'
 
So your using the remote command execution of ssh to do the scp from the
solaris box.

With that description, sounds like you could just tell the Linux box
to forward all incoming mail to the NT box as well as delivering it
locally.  Test it by sending mail to the Linux box, where it'll end up
on both servers.

Once you're confident in the Linux server and ready to transition, cut
the DNS MX record or IP address over to the Linux box, preserving the
forward to the NT box.  Once that's done (DNS records can take up to a
week) you can migrate the users from the NT server to the Linux server
as you like, since mail will be coming in to both places.

Do be aware of what their mail clients are doing to the mailspool on
the server.  They might be deleting mail, or just marking it read, and
either way, the transition might screw things up and cause double
messages in users' inboxes.

Then start playing with the free, fun stuff that Linux enables, such
as SpamAssassin, email-virus scanning, web interfaces and mailing
lists.

Good luck and thanks for making Linux look good,
  Aaron

But I don't understand why it should work fine under solaris

I think this FAQ hits the right direction.

The solaris box .bashrc does produce a bunch of stuff
while I have another linux with login config not producing anything.
scp to that Linux box works just fine.

However, even after I removed all "output" from .bashrc on that solaris box,
I still get the same error.  sftp, however, works fine.  So I will rely
on sftp for now until I figure out what it is that sets the shell init to 
complain....

Thanks.

Matt,

I asked my Windows guru if Exchange can deliver locally AND forward a
copy of the mail to another server and he said it can certainly do
that. I vaguely remember that functionality but it's been a couple of
years since I've had to deal with Exchange.

You don't need to reinstall. You have a couple of options. Take a look
in /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 (if you are using version 4 of X). There is
an input section in there for the mouse, it should look similar to this:

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Configured Mouse"
        Driver          "mouse"
        Option          "CorePointer"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/psaux"
        Option          "Protocol"              "PS/2"
        Option          "ZAxisMapping"          "4 5"
EndSection

The last option corresponds to the mouse wheel. Add or fix that line
and then restart the X server (logging out and in will do it).

If that doesn't do it you can try one of the utilities, such as
xf86config. Be safe and make a backup copy of your XF86Config[-4]
file.

HTH,
Keith

  Is this winduhs? If you are referring to linux then a dead mouse (or mouse
exercise wheel) does _not_ require the standard Microsoft solution. Go buy a
new mouse and plug it in. If your system does not recognize it, then try
shutting down X and restarting it, killing gpm and restarting it and -- as a
last resort -- rebooting.

  Well, ... a really tiny kid's shirt. One's about 3" high, the other's
about 6" high. Or, perhaps Paul Nelson will allow you to borrow the one that
sits on top of the rack system at Riverdale H.S. That one, however, will

well I don't get it but it works now. I really did not do anything but
rebooted my computer a bunch of times. computers seem to be a mystery
some to me sometimes. 

I think the reason that this happened is that how ever turned the
computer off the last time just pushed the power switch. I know that
this is not that best thing to do but can it really shrew things up hard
core?

Of course, it's not meant to sound like Dr. Seuss.. it doesn't follow his
style at all.

It's clearly written to follow the tune of "Turkey In The Straw".

This is as annoying as every mildly humorous song on OpenNap being
labelled as "Weird Al".

So... I'm setting up this Samba+LDAP thing.

I'm looking at these smbldap-tools for creating users and machine accounts
and stuff.  I installed 'em and configured 'em, but they don't seem to be
doing what I'd like them to be doing.

They're creating LDAP entries under People, which seems right... but
they're ALSO creating entries in unix accounts for those people.  Is that
how it should be?  It seems like a mess.  Do I need unix users for each of
the Samba users?  Can't Samba just check LDAP for permissions and stuff
instead of using filesystem permissions?

Confused,
Jeme.

The only way to really do this is to setup an ip-relay that will relay
packets to both servers.  The NT box would have to change its IP
address, and all of your users would have to reconfigure their email
clients.  I'm not sure if it is worth the effort.

I would suggest setting up forwarding on the NT box, sending the mail to
user at IP-address-of-linux-box.  Then when the boss gets tired of how slow
his email client is getting (because it now has twice the load),
shutdown the NT box, reconfigure all of the email clients (disable the
NT account, and change the linux account to new IP address), then change
the IP address of the linux box to that of the NT box.  If something
goes wrong, all you have to do is unplug the linux box (so it stops
receiving mail), reconfigure all the mail clients and then bring the NT
box back up.  

This is assuming that the company has followed M$'s advice (only one
service per server) and the only service being provided by this NT box
is email.

I agree, and the address change of the linux box will need to be delt
with in each of the users mail clients, and disabling the NT accounts.

It's the work of Gene Ziegler, and is, in the author's words...

    "A very popular, often published, and frequently stolen poem written
    in classical Dr. Seuss, Cat-In-Hat style. The poem has a colorful
    history of both pain and pleasure for the author. Read and enjoy,
    but don't steal."

It is rarely quoted in full (current forward not excepted), and I've
never seen the proper attribution on any of the many forwards I've
gotten. The author's web site is:

    http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/elz1/clocktower/

You'll find it listed there as "A Grandchild's Guide to Using Grandpa's
Computer", it's proper appellation. You'll also find Dr. Ziegler's
response to the plagiarism ("Hang the Information Highwayman!").

He's an interesting fellow, and his original work merits a visit to his
site. Check it out. I've had a link to his site from my own for many
years.

You need posixAccount attributes for username<=>UID mapping.  What's
messy about it?  Without LDAP, you'd need accounts in /etc/passwd and
smbpasswd--this is basically the same thing, with flat-file databases
replaced with a directory.  You could, I suppose, use 'force user' and
'force group' to force all files to be owned by one user:group, but
that's enough of a corner-case that no one bothers with it.

You also get a couple of other things for free--like the ability to have
multiple boxes with a single user-name-space and "Consistent Sign-On". 
Different people are more or less excited about being able to use it as
an internal addressbook.

Sandy,

  Thanks for the pointer! He is a gifted writer and his site is a
fascinating place to spend a half-hour. I think there are several potential
Simion replacements in the local area. Should we let them know of the job
opening?

He's just plain confused.  It's nothing like The Cat In The Hat and much
more like Gilbert and Sullivan.  The cadence is nothing like Seuss.  And I
still contend that it was at least unconsciously written to the tune of
Turkey In The Straw.

Just because the author thinks its in a particular style doesn't make it
so.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0402291249270.7586@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  As I slowly set up my new system I find minor stumbling blocks. Today I
upgraded Xfce on that box and fired up X. The fonts in the virtual terminals
are not as crisp on the 17" LCD monitor as they are on a CRT monitor. Is
this a function of pixel size or some other hardware-related thingie? The
colors on each character -- or between adjacent chars -- is not even.
Perhaps that's the problem.

  I've not seen this on my notebooks; perhaps that's because their monitors
are so much smaller.

  Is this common with larger LCD screens? If not, how might I tweak the
visual appearance? The display resolution is set at 1024x768 and the monitor
frequencies were not explicitly set by me. They are 48.3 kHz for horizonal
and 60 Hz for vertical (the units may be reversed -- if so that's
inadvertent).

Thanks,

Rich

Is 1024x768 the native resolution on the screen?  I would expect a 17" LCD to 
default to 1600x1200.  With LCDs, it is important to stick with that native 
resolution.

I replaced an aged Adaptec 2940 card with a newer 2940 card.  The old one
was AHA-2940UW and the new one is AHA-2940U2W.

The motherboard is a Gigabyte somethin' or other with a Via Apollo Pro133
chipset (VT82C693A/694x).

When I boot with the new card, the SCSI bios comes up alright, but as soon
as that screen ends, when control should go back to the system bios for
booting the IDE disks (the SCSI controller just has CD/DVD devices on it),
there is a continuous beep and nothing happens.

No idea where to even begin.

I REALLY want to use this new card.

Anyone?

Check to make sure all your IDE devices are plugged in correctly.
If the MOBO BIOS recognizes the SCSI card and the CD/dvd drives and
then drops back into BIOS, then the beeping indicates an IDE device or
another PCI device that is either not set correctly or does not have
the plug on tight. When you say a continuous beep, does it not stop
beeping after ten or so beeps? 

Check the manual on the MOBO as it should have the beep code on it.

Is there on board scsi on the MOBO? This might be part of the trouble
if so.

Just some food for thought.

  Good point.

  According to the carton, the maximum resolution is 1280x1024.

  I changed the "Display" stanzas in /etx/X11/XF86Config to have that
resolution first and 1024x768 second. Killed X and restarted it. No visible
difference.

  Is there something I missed? FWIW, this was my only Fry's purchase in the

It's one long tone.  It's probably not fair to call it a "beep".  It ends
when you turn off the computer.

The machine works just fine without the card or with the old card, so it's
not the IDE cables.

Nothing on one long tone.

Subject: [PLUG] CDRW device detection problem
Message-ID: <BAY9-F26W9ueBp7rZeB00028e1f@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I got a used CDRW writer and it is made by AOPEN.

X-CDRoast can detect it just fine and in fact I have successfully
duplicated a data CD with it.

However, when I ran 'cdrecord -scanbus', I got this error:

[root at localhost root]# cdrecord -scanbus
Cdrecord-Clone 2.01a19 (i686-redhat-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1995-2003 Jrg 
Schilling
cdrecord: Read-only file system. Cannot open '/dev/pg1'. Cannot open SCSI 
driver.
cdrecord: For possible targets try 'cdrecord -scanbus'. Make sure you are 
root.
cdrecord: For possible transport specifiers try 'cdrecord dev=help'.
[root at localhost root]#

XCDRoast reported that my drive is ATAPI:0,1,0.
If I specify dev=0,1,0 in cdrecord, I got back a similar complain about 
cannot
open /dev/pg1.  I simlink /dev/pg1 to /dev/cdrom1.  Still no use...

Why is it that XCDRoast works and not cdrecord?

thanks

Are you using kernel 2.6.x?  If so, you need to tell cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc (if
it's hdc) or dev=ATAPI:0,1,0 as XCDRoast stated.  The latter is preferred by
cdrecord.

If you're using 2.4.x with ide-scsi emulation for CD-RW access, I really don't
know what is up, sorry.

I've not had this particular problem, but you may want to see what bios 
version the 2940u2w card is flashed to.  If you have a different system 
you can get it to run in and boot to floppy, then you could flash it to 
latest version (if not already).  It should say the version at the 
adaptec bios prompt:

> http://www.adaptec.com/worldwide/support/drivers_by_product.html?sess=no&language=English+US&cat=%2fProduct%2fAHA-2940U2W&prodkey=AHA-2940U2W

They list 3 current bios versions for the 2940u2w, so this might 
indicate compatibility issues requiring the use of 3 unique ones (The 
2940uw only lists 2, but had *many* more versions than that)...

Just FWIW, what version bios is each 2940 card?  You might also try 
using a different PCI slot if possible.  Does it do this long continuous 
beep if there are devices connected to the SCSI cables or when there are 
no devices at all hooked up?  Try without any devices hooked up as well 
to see if this solves the beep issue - if so maybe a termination or 
lvd/se issue...

  However, when I change the alias in ~/.bash_profile to 'all', the system

Dear all:

I have now a different cdrecord problems.  I have a wav file that I want
to try burning onto a CD-R so regular CD-player can play it.

The wav file is ok as I can play it back on my RH9 box.  When I do a file
on it, it does report as a valid wav file.

cdrecord, however, complains that it has inappropriate audio coding.
I have included output below.  Any tips much appreciated....

Uh... I don't know what part of which alias you're changing to 'all', but
I'll show you mine:

alias ls='ls --color=if-tty -aF'

This'll give me color codes for tty output and no color codes when I dump
to file or pipe to another program.

It's not the latest version and I haven't tried it in any other systems.
So there's something to do.  I don't have too many systems to test,
though.

I'll read them and see if anything sounds right.

The new card is 2.0 with a 1997 bios.  Surely that could be updated if it
would only let the system boot.

Will do.

Haven't tried it without any devices connected, either.  Good steps.

It's not termination, certainly.  What would an "lvd/se issue" be?  The
difference between the cards is essentially this, so it seems the most
likely culprit.

I believe this is covered in the CD Writing HOWTO... in order to write audio 
tracks to a CD, the source must be a very specifically encoded WAV file.  The 
bitrate, channels, stuff like that.

RTFH?  :-)   Google can tell you more specifically.  I'll bet XCDRoast does 
the conversion for you.

That's yer problem right there.  Text tooks terrible in anything other

I'll bet X is refusing to come up in 1280x1024 for some reason.  Check
your HorizSync and VertRefresh against the manual's specs for those
ranges.  Mine are at 30-90 and 50-150 respectively.

For God's sake, don't forget to send in the rebate form.

Betcha the SCSI card's BIOS is leaving things in a state the system
BIOS can't handle.  You don't need the BIOS unless you plan to boot
from SCSI devices, so try disabling it in the SCSI BIOS setup.  And
yes, you'll still be able to hit Ctrl-A and re-enable it later; the
setup prompt still comes up even if you "disable" BIOS.

If this is the case, try other versions of the MB and SCSI BIOS.
Or just leave the BIOS disabled.  As you please.

Good luck,

Aaron,

  OK. I've never noticed this on my notebooks, but I sure see it on the big
monitor.

  When I press the menu botton it tells me the horizontal frequency is 48.3
KHz and the vertical refresh is 60 Hz, at 1024x768 (this while I'm at a
console).

  In the monitor section of /etc/X11/XF86Config, the HorizSync is set for
31.5-50 KHz and the VertRefresh is set to 40-90. So that should cover it.

  There wasn't a rebate on this puppy, just an in-store sale price.

  I tried changing the 'tty' to 'all'. Didn't like it. I don't see to what
other 'tty/all' the man page might be referring.

OK, that's kinda weird ---^

Maybe you can set the value to exactly 44100 in a sound editor or with
"sox -r 44100 smallmen8.wav smallmen8a.wav".

I'm kinda surprised.  But yeah, it makes a bigger difference on a
bigger screen.

Sounds like your HorizSync needs to be higher to do 1280x1024.  To do
1280x1024 at 60Hz vertical, you'd need a horizontal sync rate of
around 65 kHz, but yours is limited to 50 kHz.  Your monitor's manual
should say what the minimum and maximum H and V sync rates are, but it
should be safe with the numbers I gave.

Message-ID: <40429803.1040201@dimstar.net>

OK, I finally have a good setup working with my laptop. Mandrake 9.2 
with a 2.6.3 kernel. It runs sweetly.

Now.. my problem.

The built in nic is eth0, the wireless card comes up as eth1. Both work, 
but when I don't plug in a cable, it takes forever to boot because eth0 
has to timeout. Should I just assign an ip to get rid of the wait?

If I have the wireless card in, it still tries to use eth0 as the 
default gateway, even when eth0 doesn't have a connection. I end up 
setting up a lot of the networking manually every time I boot my laptop.

Is there a good reference anywhere that I can use on how to set this up 
to be a little more seemless?

What manpage is this?

>From my ls manpage:

      --color[=WHEN]
              control whether color is used to  distinguish  file
              types.  WHEN may be `never', `always', or `auto'

and later:

       By default, color is not  used  to  distinguish  types  of
       files.   That  is equivalent to using --color=none.  Using
       the --color option without the optional WHEN  argument  is
       equivalent  to  using  --color=always.  With --color=auto,
       color codes are output only if  standard  output  is  con
       nected to a terminal (tty).

So it looks like if-tty has been deprecated, but still works and is
equivalent to "auto".

I don't know where you're getting "all".

I just did it and it works...
Most places said the correct wav format is 44.1 KHZ and 16 Bit so I thought
I was ok.  Did not know 44101 Hz and 44100 Hz makes a difference.

Our eth0 is set at 10.10.10.10 for the home network so there's no boot
delay when it's on a dhcp network.  Then, running dhclient gets proper
settings from the dhcp server.

Cool.  I've been happy with 2.6.3 so far, for the most part.

Bridge the wireless and the wired connections into br0 and use dhcp to assign 
an address to that.  That way, whichever is active will work.

I haven't a clue how to hack the Mandrake init scripts to do that, however.  I 
could do it very easily in Slackware, though.  :-)

Somewere I saw an announcement for some piece of software that
monitors a NIC for a cable being plugged or unplugged, and then performs
some defined action when one of these events happen. It was specifically
designed laptops with your sort of situation. I don't remember the project
name but you could probably find it by poking around on freshmeat.

So if you can find this software, I'd suggest configuring eth0 to not
initialize on boot and have this other piece of software take care of
bringing up the interface, but only if it finds that a cable is actually
plugged in.

The other option would be to modify the startup script to do interface
initialization in the background so it won't block the boot sequence.
This is how Knoppix deals with it.

  I don't have a manual for this monitor. It may have had a winduhs cdrom,
but I have nothing in the way of documentation either in the box or in the
package with everything from the system I assembled. When I went searching
on the Web I found all of four references to a Hyundai ImageQuest L705
monitor. Sigh.

  Just tried your settings. When I tried to startx I see "Video mode not
supported". Interesting, eh? That's the mode on their box. Cut back the
frequencies, but it's not that. Wonder what the next mode higher than
1024x768 is. I'll search for that tomorrow after doing payables and
receivables.

Thanks, Aaron,

  Oops! I don't have the video card (an ATI Sapphire) defined in there.
Sigh. That'll do it, I bet.

  Should be able to run Xconfigurator, no? Well, more tomorrow.

  Ah! Mea culpa. It's in the second paragraph of /etc/DIR_COLORS, but
immediately following that paragraph is the command COLOR to which it

David,

  I suppose it would. However, I mis-wrote 'man page' when I meant to refer
to /etc/DIR_COLORS itself. Making the change there does what I want: color
in a secondary shell listing.

I'm trying to setup would should be a fairly simple Samba configuration
for someone.
They have a dual-boot server with Windows Server 2003 and RH 9.  There's a
FAT32 partition that is mounted read/write for the world on the Linux
side.  I then want to share this out on the network.  Here's my smb.conf:

[global]
workgroup = somecompanyworkgroup
security = share

[Public]
path = /mnt/e/Public
read only = no
guest only = yes


Pretty simple...  and it works great when I test it on my home network.
But when a Win2K client on their network tries to access the Samba server,
this message is given:

"There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon
request."

Any ideas?
Thanks,
