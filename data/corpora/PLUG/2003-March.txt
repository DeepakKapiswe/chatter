It sounds like you have half of the problem solved. Let me repsond to each

Well, you could do something like this, especially if you are dealing with
a small business of less than a dozen people total.

I don't think this is the best solution, even though it handles the

As I understand standard practice -- & assuming that your client isn't
about to allow workers at one site to commute to the other -- this is
the way many commercial domains with multiple sites are set up. By this
I mean that setting up proper MX records with one server acting as the
secondary for the other is a Good Idea. Then IT takes the next step &
aliases all of the mailservers under one domain, so that to the outside
world everyone has an address in the user at domain.com form.

The other way this is done is to have one machine set up as a central
mail server, but still do the aliasing. Then the two offices use SMTP &
POP3 to send & receive email, & with the right kind of magic, your client's
employees can read their email from either office. The trick lies with
the aliasing, which I kinda remember how to do with sendmail -- but unless
you want to learn sendmail, I'd advise you to stick with either postfix or
exim.

Well, I know the theory of this quite well: I haven't done the actual
implimentation, so I for one would like to hear how you solved this
problem & about any gotchas you encountered.

I liked Paul's suggestions. Perhaps you have a geek buddy or two in town who
might loan you an AGP video card? Perhaps the thrift store at freegeek.org
might have one they can sell you for cheap? Perhaps you know some computer
store with a liberal open-box returns policy?

Happy troubleshooting!

What was the result when you power cycled the machine?  I wouldn't assume
that card was broken until you see the absence of video on power up.
Problems with X, the screen saver, mouse/keyboard driver, or apm could cause 
the screen to stay blanked.  Only a power cycle will truly confirm
the card is broken.

Oh yes, don't forget to try swapping video cables.

Radio Shack has heatsink compound.  Part number 276-1372, $1.99
http://www.radioshack.com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=CTLG&category%5Fname=CTLG%
5F003%5F006%5F005%5F000&product%5Fid=276%2D1372

You are welcome to some of mine, but it's probably cheaper to go to a
nearby Radio Shack than to drive here.  Be sure to call them to
be sure they have it in stock.

That sounds like something that just shouldn't happen.  I can
understand the adapter having driver problems, but the cards
shouldn't make any difference.  Any chance you just have some
other pcmcia confusion going on?  I have an Apacer adapter
which works with Knoppix but not with Slackware, so I'm
obviously no expert.

Message-ID: <5.2.0.9.0.20030302170817.00b15a90@192.168.0.2>

How about a non-os-specific question?

I have a SCSI tape drive hooked to an Adaptec 2940W controller. The 
controller posts. Should the controller recognize the drive during post, or 
does it ignore it, similar to how some EIDE controllers ignore CD ROMs 
during post?

I've tried setting the drive to various SCSI ids. It's an external drive, 
although I can take it out of the housing and hook it up to the card 
internally. I haven't tried that yet.

SCSI termination is present on the back of the drive housing, and it's turn 
on in the card setup. The card doesn't recognize the drive in setup either.

The drive is a Sony, SDT-S9000. It basically a SDT-9000 with an external 
chassis.

Thanks in advance for any ideas.

I don't know if your specific controller has different options, but every
SCSI controller I've used has enumerated devices on its bus(es) on POST.

1) do you have other devices besides the tape drive on that SCSI bus?
2) do you have physical termination resistor packs on the controller card,
or is SCSI termination handled by jumpers or software?
3) are you confident that you have good cables?

I saw a device called SmartDisk recently. It plugged-into the IDE connector
on the motherboard and looked like a 32MB IDE hard drive to the BIOS. I
don't know whether it's write-protectable. I don't know at what other
capacities it might be available. I don't know how much it costs.

I recommend www.google.com for these details.

I did format the card with the camera.
I am pretty sure it is not my pcmcia setup.
I can plug in the old card and mount it and read it.
I pop out the old one and plug in the new one and it fails.
The card works in the camera so I don't think it is bad.
I like to know if anyone as had similar experiences with 
other brands of smartmedia

Please disregard my previous message. A little more digging and I've
determined that the motherboard in question had a CF port on it (embedded
device) and the SmartDisk device was nothing more than a standard CF flash
memory device. <SIGH>

On the other hand, I've seen IDE and SCSI drives made of RAM:

I've turned up this by Addonics
http://www.addonics.com/products/flash_memory_reader/ide_digidrive.asp

but googling doesn't indicate success with Linux.  Perhaps the logic that 
selects the active `port` is software-based.
But they do make USB reader/writers that work with Linux.

Vulnerability

Internet Security Systems Security Brief
March 3, 2002

Remote Sendmail Header Processing Vulnerability

Synopsis:

ISS X-Force has discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Sendmail
Mail Transfer Agent (MTA). Sendmail is the most common MTA and has been
documented to handle between 50% and 75% of all Internet email traffic.

Impact:

Attackers may remotely exploit this vulnerability to gain "root" or
superuser
control of any vulnerable Sendmail server. Sendmail and all other email
servers are typically exposed to the Internet in order to send and receive
Internet email. Vulnerable Sendmail servers will not be protected by legacy
security devices such as firewalls and/or packet filters. This vulnerability
is especially dangerous because the exploit can be delivered within an email
message and the attacker doesn't need any specific knowledge of the target
to
launch a successful attack. 

Affected Versions:

Sendmail versions from 5.79 to 8.12.7 are vulnerable

Note: The affected versions of Sendmail commercial, Sendmail open source
running on all platforms are known to be vulnerable.

wondering if anyone had any experience or advice with this combination. 
I'd like to have a sense of what I'm getting into before I begin

as I've yet enountered in my Linux experience.

An increasing number of my customers are no longer
using sendmail. It seems that Postfix has become the
new standard for email on *nix. It's included with
many Linux distributions though not necessarily
installed by default as it is on, say, UnitedLinux.

I'm co-authoring a book on Email right now that makes
the assumption that Postfix is the standard, though
it does mention that Exim and qmail are also fine
servers. Sendmail is covered minimally - as one would
cover a legacy product. I'm doing the server-side
portion of the book and my co-author is doing the
client-side. Our tech reviewer is the author of a
well-known mail client.

I'd be pleased to hear what you think are the most
confusing email concepts or issues, so I can be sure
I'm doing justice to the subject in the book.

I'm using postfix on stonehenge.com and have been quite happy with it.
Between postfix and openbsd, I can sleep at night knowing that
only one out of every 100 security advisories apply to me. :)

Yes, it's great. Postfix instead of sendmail. djbdns
instead of BIND. ncftpd instead of WuFTP. Linux or
xBSD instead of Windows. Anything instead of IIS. You
have to be pretty clueless to be a victim of so many
common security issues these days.

One common point of confusion is all the MTAs use a component named 
'sendmail', which of course gets confused with Sendmail. I've heard this is 
because some programs are hardcoded to look for sendmail, instead of $MTA. 

A common point of confusion with Postfix is what's the difference between 
'postfix reload' and 'postfix restart.' Yeah, everybody knows about how the 
first re-reads only main.cf, not master.cf, but what does it mean to the 
admin? And I thought I heard rumblings that this was going to change anyway.

With all the little specialized utilities like fetchmail, procmail, Cyrus, 
spam filters, etc it's confusing which of these are really needed.

OK, you wanted some 0.02, there's 0.06.

cheers,
Carla

I don't have any experience with that combination, but I can tell you
that the vmware news groups are a great place to find out.  Use their
news server at news.vmware.com.  I was having problems with VMWare on
Redhat 7.3 and quickly got a wealth of information from them.

That is a pretty large sweeping statement.  I run qmail both in
corporate and personal environments.  Qmail has a fairly large install
base.

I heard of large deployments of exim as well.  This is the default on
some versions of Debian (most new ones?).

Once I rebuild my desktop I'm going to play with postfix and give it a
try.  I'm just happy there are many alternatives to sendmail. :)

Instead of "the new standard for email on *nix", maybe "a significant
force in the world of Internet email." <g>

Here is some stuff that would be nice to include:

* Relaying.. "how did we get on that damn block list?"
* VirtualDomains
* Receiving server vs. sending server.. POP/IMAP vs. SMTP 
  "I have to put my ISP's SMTP server in my mozilla config?"
* ESTMP vs STMP
* Authenticated SMTP.. issues with specific clients (like NS4.7)
* secure mail transport
* spool storage.. NFS..etc.
* speed tweaks (specific to each MTA)
* UUCP integration with FidoNet (oh.. wait.. no.. scratch that one)

I'd like to backup an ext3 filesystem.  I'm fond of the interface for
dump/restore, but the man page says it's only compatible with ext2.  And
dump is at version 0.4-something, which doesn't give me big warm fuzzies.

dump is not reliable on 2.4 kernels for some reason.  I've done a couple
tests and successfully dumped and restored up to 20 gigs on an ext3

Has anyone encountered any issues with dump/restore on Linux?  Or have a
good explanation of why this might be a bad idea?
Thanks,

Ed,

  When I first started using linux, about 5 years ago, it took me quite a
while to understand that e-mail requires 1 from column A, one from column B,
one from column C and (perhaps) one from column D. Once I understood that
the rest was easy.

  There are four separate, but integrated components of a mail system. For
systems not running a local server one needs fetchmail. Then, everyone needs a
MTA to handle incoming and outgoing mail. After this comes the MDA (most of
us use procmail) and, finally, the MUA of which there are a gazillion
choices (text and graphical).

  Understanding the flow of both incoming and outgoing messages does not
come from reading man pages or looking at a list of application choices.
It's necessary to understand the big picture so the appropriate choices can
be made for each component.

Since Postfix, Exim, qmail, and others are Sendmail replacements,
these alternative mail programs must masquerade as Sendmail to
satisfy legacy applications or users.

"postfix reload" is supported by the postfix program and,
as you say, is used after changes to main.cf occur.

The postfix program does not support a "postfix restart"
command as far as I can tell. Instead it uses "postfix
start" and "postfix stop". However, the startup script in
/etc/init.d (or /etc/rc.d/init.d) has a restart command,
which is probably a "postscript stop" followed by a
"postscript start". I dunno. I don't have Postfix running
on a box with a System V-style startup at the moment.

I believe these use a local daemon, not an MTA. At least that's what my 
second-fave guru told me once. 

signed, I get faster replies when I'm wrong

Not a troll.  After looking carefully and consulting with others,
I'm running openbsd on stonehenge.com because I want to sleep at night.

Linux has a large installed base.  This makes it a prime target for
scriptkiddy hackers, because an exploit will work on so many more
computers.  OpenBSD has a much smaller installed base, making it a
lower target.

OpenBSD also has an intense focus on source-level peer review of every
line of core installed code.  Linux can't afford that level of review,
because it has to appeal to a broader audience with more features
sooner, and more developers contributing.  In essence, its success
strangles it.

In the four years since OpenBSD's initial release, there's been only
*one* remote root exploit, and that was in OpenSSL code that was
incorporated wholesale into OpenBSD, and also affected Linux and other
Unix distros.

The track record matches the announced intentions.  OpenBSD is about
security, and that gives me peace of mind.

Please note that this is OpenBSD specifically, and not FreeBSD or
NetBSD.  I make no claims for the other families.

Okay, so I'm a doof - I don't have a boot floppy.

Now that we've got that out of the way, I have a Mandrake machine that hangs
on boot. It gets to the stage where it's assigning the hostname, it sez
"[OK]" and then it stops dead.

I rebooted the machine because 1) X wouldn't start correctly and 2) it
appeared that the ls command disappeared. At least, I couldn't use it via
telnet.

So, any takers?  pointers/help?

Reinstalling is no problem, and I may end up doing that anyway.

OK, call me old fashioned. I use sendmail. It does what I need doing 
and, this week's notice aside, hasn't had many security problems of 
late.

Plus:

* libmilter is downright cool, and works very quickly with virus 
  scanners and SpamAssassin

* you can do stuff like "allow unencrypted, unathenticated SMTP from 
  network A, but require 128-bit, authenticated connections from 
  anywhere else"

All of which is not to say Postfix, Qmail, Exim, and others aren't 
cool too. It's just that some of us aren't terribly dissatisifed with 
sendmail.

If you are using GRUB then you can just hit, e to edit the the selection
under the title, then go down to the kernel line, type e again, at the
end of the line type single.  This will boot you into single user mode,
and you might be able to fix things at that level

Do you need it running? Only if Tripwire or crond are sending the mail via 
SMTP. If it's local delivery, then they probably will start there own 
sendmail instance to do it. I know Tripwire will do it that way, and I 
assume crond will do so as well.

Sendmail's recent security record is quite good; unlike that other hoary relic 
of the Unix stone age, BIND, its security and performance have kept up with 
the times.

"If it ain't broke" is still a good axiom.

Here here! That was one of my biggest confusions when setting up my
current fetchmail/procmail/spamassassin/postfix email setup. I couldn't
figure out if I was running an email server or not or what portions of
"sendmail" or postfix I used exactly.

That's a good point. That's the most confusing part, I think. That nowhere
(at least nowhere that I've seen, not in the SuSE documentation that I
have or any book I've read) is the relationship between the various
components explained at a high level. Man pages aren't enough for this, so
I know I for one would definitely buy a book that could sort this out.

  When I figured it all out I considered writing such a book. But, the
realities of making a living intervened. Also, once I understood it the

What I have as yet been unable to do, is to set up my postfix server
running on debian to use SSL/TLS etc so I can send mail through my
server in an authenticated manner.  That is the part I'm having trouble
with.

The book titled "Postfix" by Richard Blum covers the high-level view
pretty well, in addition to detailed coverage of managing Postfix itself.

  Very true. And very useful when I set up postfix about a year ago. But, it
wasn't available about five years ago. And those using other MTAs wouldn't
think of buying a postfix book.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0303031649520.17749-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  The version of postgresql installed here is 7.2.1, as placed on the system
by the RH 7.3 installation last September. I just rebuilt the .src.rpm for
postgresql-7.3.2 with the target as i686.

  The new versions cannot be used to freshen the installed packages because,
I assume, the earlier version was built with a i386 target. Can I resolve
this conundrum quickly and simply, or do I fall back to the i386 target when
rebuiling the source rpm?

I agree, setting up any kind of authenticated relay was way too

I wouldn't call the following a lead, but for the members
of the unemployed SIG (of which I managed to leave), I
had an interesting talk with a fellow tonight about
a possible job.

The long & the short of it was this: he works for a
local divison of Ricoh (the folks who sell copiers) as a
network engineer/technician/guy who gets paid to make stuff work.
He told me that his group is finding things slow because
they lack a salesman who knows how to sell network
consulting; they have all the copier salesmen that they
need, but none of them knows how to sell Netware, Linux
or Windows consulting. (And he is interested in getting
more Linux work for his group.)

As he explained, his management has basically given up
looking to fill this position, & are waiting for the
right person to come in & sell him/herself to them.
Which -- to me -- suggests that this is a job that is
out there, but not actually advertised. And can be landed
with a little bit of work by the right person.

Obviously, this will require more than sending a resume
& a follow-up call. And obviously, not everyone on this
list is a salesman. But I suspect that there is someone
out there who knows someone who wouldn't mind selling a
solid product (e.g., Linux networking) for a change from
the usual garbage that so many consulting groups want to
offer (e.g., that other ``Operating System").

If you are interested, & need a bit more help in researching
this position, contact me off-list. I have no input beyond
perhaps being a reference for this job, so don't send me
any resumes. Or sales specials on Symantec Antivirus software.

I use a Windows OCR program under WINE.After reading
the above article, I'm still convinced that doing this
is the best option.

When I click on "Preferences" in the GNOME menu, and
then "Font," there is a drop-down menu listing fonts.
Where are these fonts actually located? I might want
to add to the list.

Take a look at the font server's list in /etc/X11/fs/config

You may need to restart X so that Gnome picks up any changes.

There are a couple likely locations:

* /usr/share/fonts/default
* /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts

For a more complete take, try 'locate .ttf' or 'locate .afm' on your 
system.

Are you using these in conjunction with each other?

qpage looks like a pager software, can it be prompted by Nagios?

Paul! Glad to hear it. For the most part, I've learned how to tweak
Sendmail and it's been doing a good job for me for years. However, with
the install of RH8 on my mail server, I can't send mail internally
anymore. I've added localhost and localhost.lankow.net to my
local-host-names file. When run-parts tries to send root email, it can't
get delivered. Maybe this is the time to try postfix unless you know a
simple fix.

I can get mail in and send it out no problem - this happen just with
internal mail.

The following posting was sent to the PLUG list at the wrong address.
Would some of you respond.  I know Linux runs on Macs, but I'm not
sure what distributions are available or should be recommended.

Actually, I'm interested in the answer.
I have an old Mac laying around that I always thought I would put
Linux on at some point.

I'm still a fan of sendmail myself.

I have used qmail, postfix, exim, smail, and ...  Some of these are
pretty nice.  They are often easier to use than sendmail and seem
more secure.  Most of them also run faster.

However, sendmail is fast enough for 99% of all mail servers, and
sendmail has been hacked enough that it is fairly secure - altho
one gets an uneasy feeling because it is not security be design.
Finally, sendmail is flexible.  It isn't particularly easy to use,
but it will do almost anything and that is kind of nice.

Several distributions moved to postfix or something else as the
default MTA and then moved back.  I can understand this.  I seem
to move away from sendmail and then I run into a problem and end
of moving back.  I know I installed a couple mail servers for a
client a while back and for some reason we decided to install one
as sendmail and the other as postfix.  By the time I finished
setting up the postfix machine, I was very glad I used sendmail
on the primary machine.

Does localhost.lankow.net resolve? If you type "dig localhost.lankow.net", 
what are the results?

Two misconceptions I see a lot about linux on apple hardware is that
you have to use MK Linux, and/or you must have MacOS installed and
boot linux from within that. Both of these are false in the general
case. MK Linux is basically dead, afaik, but it does work on older
hardware where more recent distributions/kernels wont (I believe you
must use the MK Kernel for non-new world macs). If you have
openfirmware on your mac (all new-world macs do), then you can use
that to start yaboot which is analagous to lilo / grub.

If you do have a macOS partition, you can use MOL (Mac-On-Linux) to
run MacOS within linux.. somewhat like vmware, iirc, but I've never
done it.. another interesting project is Basilisk II, a full mac
emulator that runs in x86. (I may have the name a bit off, going from
memory).

As far as I know, debian, Yellow Dog, Black Lab, and MK Linux are
available for various blends of Apple hardware.

I'm running debian on an old Imac (a 266 G3, with 128). It does quite
well, there is some weirdness with the nic disconnecting at random
times (requires a networking restart to fix it) but that is probably
just my hardware. I previously ran Yellow Dog Linux on it, and didn't
have that problem.

On the whole I've been pretty happy with it (a cron'd perl script
hides the network error reasonably well).

When I had a Blue-and-White G3 with the new world PROM, I used Mandrake PPC
and Yellow Dog at different times.  Both booted from yaboot, though I had to
hunt to find the right settings to pass to the boot PROM to select the right
partition (it's in the Mandrake setup guide, I later discovered).  But it
dual-booted Linux and OS9 just fine.

I've got the Mandrake CDs laying around which someone is welcome to take off
my hands, as I traded my Mac for an O2 a while back...

Gentoo does Mac PPC too.  I put it on a lot of old world g3 machines. 
It requires the Mac os be installed mimimally to boot Linux from using 
bootx.

The newer macs do not require Mac Os to be installed as stated below.

They come back with my outside IP rather than 127.0.0.1
Normally, it would come back and say 'localhost' I believe, and it's
picking up 'lankow.net' for the Dj line of sendmail.cf - previous versions
of Sendmail hasn't done that. Previous versions also didn't have the
local-host-names file either, as I recall.

Paul

Does it help to add localhost.lankow.net to the existing localhost 
entry in /etc/hosts? (IOW, so localhost.lankow.net points to 
127.0.0.1.)

Nope. Tried that weeks ago. Just to make things interesting, sometimes the
message will come back including my outside IP address:

prj sendmail[17921]: h24JkcKe017921: to=root, ctladdr=root (0/0),

relay=localhost.lankow.net. [12.224.240.10], dsn=4.0.0, stat=Deferred:
Connection timed out with localhost.lankow.net.

Getting out my Postfix documentation :-(,
Paul

Message-ID: <1046765283.5202.41.camel@traveller.home.com>

Rubyists (and those curious about Ruby):

We'll be having our monthly meeting this coming Monday March 10th at
7PM. This time we'll meet on the East side at:

The Lucky Lab At SE Hawthorne and 10th (north side of the street).

This month we'll have a presentation by Lennon Day-Reynolds on his yet
unamed database binding library discussed in a recent post to ruby-talk.
>From his post:

  I have a simple binding library which lets you do something like the
  following:

  class Foo
     attr_reader :bar, baz
     attr_writer :bar, :baz
  end
  Persist::bind(Foo, 'foo_table', :bar, :baz)
  f = Foo.fetch('pkey_value')
  f.bar = 3
  f.store
  Foo.select('where bar > ?', 2) {|foo_obj|
     p foo_obj
  }

 It handles about 80% of the database queries I use in a moderately
 complex (~20kloc)
 business application, with the remaining bits done in basic DBI calls.

 I've also been experimenting with a thread-safe LRU cache for objects, 
 so that at least multiple concurrent reads of a database-bound data
 object don't have to make a full round trip to the database for each
 instance.

 Right now, it's not really package as a standalone library, but I'd be
 happy to go back over the code, clean it up, and either post it here 
 or on RAA for others to try out.

Subject: [PLUG] trouble with GNOME
Message-ID: <3E651956.2060600@yahoo.com>

I finally made the switch to Linux.  It has been a lot of fun and a lot 
of frustration as I struggle to learn the idiosyncrocies of this OS.

One problem I have had are critical errors on my user accounts.  After 
struggling to fix them, I decided to simply delete them from the GUI. 
 When I added the new account with the same name I had the same problems 
- mozilla launching and then crashing was one issue.  I finally just 
renamed the user directories with a .old and created new account through 
xterm.

Although Mozilla works, now my evolution mail client will not launch.

I believe many of the problems I am having are a result of an initial 
issue I have at start-up.  The following is the error message I get when 
I login:

Could not look up internet address for <local computer>.
This will prevent GNOME from operating correctly.
It may be possible to correct the problem by adding
<local computer> to the file /etc/hosts

Any suggestions on what is going on and what I need to do to fix it?

I am running Redhat 8

Make sure your hostname is in your /etc/hosts file, pointing to
127.0.0.1

This should fix any issues with the start up problem, you should then be
able to put back all your evolution stuff, and hopefully that will fix
evolution (which is kinda finiky).

Does your /etc/hosts file have this line:

127.0.0.1       localhost       localhost.localdomain

This must be in every single /etc/hosts file, on every Linux system.

Several distributions have PPC versions: Debian and Gentoo come to mind,
and there's Yellow Dog Linux, a Red Hat derivative. The Yellow Dog
company has figured out much of the configuration stuff for its
customers, but sadly the distro is RPM-based. I think SuSE also has a
PPC version.

It depends on what vintage the Mac is. Non-PCI based Macs (NuBus,
namely) are, IIRC, without many options. There was MkLinux several years
ago (Mach micro-kernel based) that ran on the older machines, but it had
pretty much stagnated the last time I checked. There are BSD options for
the old 68k Macs, naturally.

I don't know much of anything about the K12 stuff (is the author
referring to the LTSP project?), so I can't comment here. The iMac
mentioned is certainly new enough to be able to run any of the
aforementioned PPC distros.

Yellow Dog probably. It sounds as if the author wouldn't be a good
candidate for Debian, and certainly not Gentoo. :-)

Oh, and here I was thinking it was silly and unhelpful, like they'd released

Nubus based Macs can be used as LTSP clients:
http://www.ltsp.org/contrib/ltsp-ppc/doc/t1.htm

Don't think that applies in this case.

If you can run Mac OS X, you can use the X11 server to connect as a
terminal.
http://k12ltsp.org/osx_howto.html

I don't know if this works with Apple's X11 implementation. This was
initially done with Xdarwin.

I'm pretty sure Wine needs to be on x86 architecture. You might try
out Bochs, though it has a reputation of being, uh, slow.

More importantly, as the FAQ referenced above points out, it seems as if
the only real requirement for LTSP on Macs is a reasonably functional
Linux implementation. This isn't a problem anymore. As for NuBus, the
only NuBus-based (non-PCI) PowerMacs were the original [6-8]1xx series,
and I can't imagine there are many people still trying to do productive
work with those.

Nope. They're in much better shape.

You don't work in public schools, do you? ;-) We still support all

I've had the same trouble when I first switched to linux.  There are
actually two files you will want to check.

This is the entry on the computer name from my Linux Cheat Sheet:


Changing the Computer name

     1. Log in as root.
     2. Edit /etc/hosts to read as the following
        127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost {desired computer
        name}
     3. Edit /etc/sysconfig/network to read as the following
        NETWORKING=yes
        HOSTNAME={desired computer name} (same as #2)
        
Replace {desired computer name} with what you want to call the server. 
I call mine Robbert (okay, so I'm vain, big deal :) ).  So my /etc/hosts
file looks like this
127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost robbert

And my /etc/sysconfig/network file looks like this
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=robbert

Hope this helps.

Are you sure about this?  I just tried the following:
dcf>$ find . | grep DS_Store | xargs ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 dcf  dcf  0 Mar  4 20:52 ./DS_Store

the command itself seems OK.  Are you sure there isn't something going on
like your 'rm' command being aliased to something weird?

I suspect the problem is more to do with file names with single quotes that
you're parsing than with underscores. You shouldn't need all those pipes or
xargs...

[bigfish at kippered findtest]$ ls -R
.:
a  b  c  DS_store  findtest2

./findtest2:
1  2  3  DS_store  findtest3a  findtest3b

./findtest2/findtest3a:
herring

./findtest2/findtest3b:
DS_store
[bigfish at kippered findtest]$ find . -name DS_store -exec rm {} \;
[bigfish at kippered findtest]$ ls -R

Message-ID: <20030305050517.98049.qmail@web9601.mail.yahoo.com>

Today I was preparing an MS Word document for
publication using Crossover Office under Linux. In
mid-afternoon the file weighed in at a little under
2MB, then I added a 100K picture and the file was
about 10MB! I couldn't believe it, but it really was
that big.(It was a VFAT file--VERY fat--and my native
filesystem is .ext3.)

The file looked perfectly fine, and I can spare the
10MB space on the hard drive. But people complain if
you send them something that large over the Internet,
uneless they are expecting it. The reason I had to
prepare a .doc file was that the person receiving it
was to convert it to a Web document, and I doubt that
it will be unduly bulky after this process is
completed.

Nevertheless, this is disturbing. I suppose it has
something to do with cluster size. Does anyone have
suggestions about this?

IIRC, 

1) We verified that the card was good in another system
2) We used a different AGP card in the slot, and it worked fine
3) We removed the drivers for the card and COMPLETELY reinstalled it

If this is all true, maybe we need to go into the BIOS and "reset configuration 
data" so that it allows the PC to rejuggle the resources with the accursed M$ OS. 
You might also look to see if the BIOS is aware that there is a plug and pray 
compatible OS installed.

That's what I'd do if it was one I was fixing.

change for the sake of change?

This sounds like a customer of mine who wants to update his systems
because they're "old". They still work great and there's no
indication there's a capacity or speed problem.

If your customer wants to offload some used stuff, let me know - I'm collecting for a cluster.  Let him spend the bucks.  I might get my hi-tech job back and be able to spend some money on new hardware as well!  I'm semi-teasing here.  I hate to see good hardware thrown away, but it hurts to be out of work as well.

xargs is faster for large numbers of files, the above command spawns a
new rm process for each file found, while xargs only calls rm once.

I've had the same trouble when I first switched to linux.  There are
actually two files you will want to check.

This is the entry on the computer name from my Linux Cheat Sheet:


Changing the Computer name

     1. Log in as root.
     2. Edit /etc/hosts to read as the following
        127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost {desired computer
        name}
     3. Edit /etc/sysconfig/network to read as the following
        NETWORKING=yes
        HOSTNAME={desired computer name} (same as #2)
        
Replace {desired computer name} with what you want to call the server. 
I call mine Robbert (okay, so I'm vain, big deal :) ).  So my /etc/hosts
file looks like this 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost robbert

And my /etc/sysconfig/network file looks like this NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=robbert

Hope this helps.

Robbert

graphics.  We did this on two motherboards (same part number) and got

This is an Intel D845GBVL, a P4 motherboard.

I did try upgrading the BIOS from P09 to P13.  No diff.

How about the BIOS resources shuffle and PNP awareness setings?

PNP is off.  There is only one other card in the box, a PCI audio
card.  All the PCI slots are auto configured.

This is going off some old memories of mine, but I don't remember what 
Word does to embedded pictures, but I do remember docs taking up lots of 
space.  RTF files with pictures take up more space that the same doc 
saved in DOC format. (Otherwise, DOC took up more space.)

Anyway, since the picture is the problem, could you just send it seperately?

Well since you asked  for wild guesses, how about the video
card somehow mucking up the monitor in modes only
produced by this card.
Try another monitor on the system.

I suspect that the graphic you added was stored in JPEG, GIF, or some
other suitably compressed file format -- and I further suspect that
Word uncompresses embedded graphics and stores them as raw bitmaps.

  Bad video card. I had purchased an ATI Xpert-2000 AGP card last November
30th to replace a failing card in a machine. It worked last Wednesday. No
one used that machine last Thursday. Last Friday there was no video -- as
you describe -- and the monitor light would not turn green.

  Last Saturday I took the card and receipt back to ENU and came back with a
replacement. Put that in and the system once again has a video display on
the monitor.

  I don't recall if you wrote that the same card worked in another system,
but my recent experience suggests that video cards can -- and do -- die at a
very young age.

Even though there is only one exterior card in the box, the PNP stuff manages 
many resources for the MOBO, like IRQ sharing and memory allocations for the USB, 
DMA controllers, floppy controller and whatnot.

Let's try turning the PNP on and allowing it to "reset configuration data" at the 
same time.

Subject: [PLUG] off-hours router support?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0303050823340.21144-100000@k12linux.mesd.k12.or.us>

We're looking into the possibility of outsourcing the off-hours monitoring
and repair of a key router*.

Has anyone had great experiences with a company that provides such services?

-Eric

* key router is currently hypothetical, no specific make/model info available

something similar to the MS Exchange?

I have a 200-something MHz Pentium II system if you need one.
You can have it for free.

Two routes. First the "do it yourself" way:

  The "Exchange Server Replacement HOWTO:"

  http://www.arrayservices.com/projects/Exchange-HOWTO/html/book1.html

Second, the "fire and forget" way: 

  Bynari Insight Server:

How about the IRQ for VGA setting?  Is the sound card in the first PCI

SuSe has an OpenExchange server, not cheap, but they will help you
migrate from your current software.

This works without to much issue if you have less than 960Mb RAM. SuSE includes
large memory kernels that will be install on systems with more than 1G Ram.
These kernels cause vmware to seg fault. Setting the memory to 960Mb at the
boot prompt will stop this but disable memory above 960. 

Thank you
Russell

Seems like this should be done by the network configuration.

Either as a static entry with the IP address, or from the DHCP server.

If the address space of the network changes, and it has a default route
loading independant of the network configuration, the machine could get
very confused.

Just trying to save headaches later.

There is a 4.0 beta that may fix this problem.

On a recent reboot my computer freaked out and refused to boot into
xwindows.  I changed the inittab to login at console and tried to go in
trough startx and was greeted with a fatal error message.

I was dinking around with the XF86config file trying to see if I could
get my wheel mouse to work and think I might have screwed something up.
I tried to run XFree86 from GUI but didn't see anything happen.

Now I am unable to get to any GUI.

What have I done?!

I ran fsck /dev/hda1, but to no avail.

The error messages that are returned on startx failure are:

Fatal Server Error:
Could not open default font 'fixed'

Could not init font path element unix/:700, removing from list!

BTW - how do I do a screen capture in Linux?

'alias' doesn't return anything with rm involved.  As far as I know it
is not aliased to something else.

I had not tried this as I have been wary by lack of experience of using
exec.  It looks like it would work though.  Basically I ripped my cds on
my powerbook in iTunes then tried to store them on my linux box where
there is lots more space.  I just copied over the directories completely
and they had a lot of unwanted hidden files (for the iTunes xml database
I assume)

(Yup, I've found http://www.linux1394.org ...)

The 'sbp2' driver reports the presence of the disk, as does

    # cat /proc/scsi/scsi

But I can't figure out what device name to use to partition or mount
the darned thing ...

Any tips?

Didya try /dev/sd0 and /dev/sd1?  It should be one of those scsi
devices, I forget how to use them as the only scsi type stuff I use is
ide-scsi emulation on my CD-RW drive...

Trying to scrape the MacOS turds off your file system? :-)

The following worked for me in the past:

	find /path/to/scour -name '\.DS_Store' -exec rm -fr '{}' ';'

Don't forget to look for the '.finder_info/' and '.resource/'
directories, too. I suppose this could all be done in one swell foop,
but my find/regex abilities aren't that great.

For RedHat users ... (other distro's may vary)...

The default route is set at boot time in /etc/sysconfig/network
by the GATEWAY variable, so for the above IP address you would
want a line that reads
   
   GATEWAY=192.168.0.254

Additional static routes (for RedHat 7.1 and later ...) are
handled by /etc/sysconfig/static-routes.  It's a bit more complex,
but if you want a route to 172.16.0.0 (for example), through gateway
192.168.0.250 to be inserted into your route table, then the magic
line is

   any   net 172.16.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0  gw 192.168.0.250  metric 1

"any" --> adds the route for any interface that's up (apparently you can
          specify routes which are added only when a particular interface
          is brought up -- makes sense for dial-up situations).

The rest of the line is preprended with "route add -" and then
executed.

Is this a system that wants or needs acpi and/or apci support?

I've been playing with one of the Shuttle cube systems (sk41g) and the
gentoo distribution.  Depending on exactly what kernel patches you use,
there can be problems.  The consensus on the gentoo forums seems to be
problems getting interrupts set up right, related to how well acpi
and apci is working.

Reported symptoms include 
	no usb devices working
	no firewire devices working
	realtek 8139 ethernet chips not responding
I've seen most of those while playing around.  Of the gentoo kernels
I've tried so far, gentoo-sources-2.4.19 works the best.  
Unfortunately it predates official linux support for the via vt8235
southbridge so ide drives have problems with dma.  But everything 
else works, including fireware (disks at /dev/sda and /dev/sdb).

On other motherboards people have reported success turning acpi
and/or apci on or off in the bios.

If you are not getting any error messages, you might consider launching
evolution from a terminal to see if you get any error messages there. 
When I corrected the two files I mentioned earlier, everything worked
fine.

   Follow the Patents, People

   Quite a buzz formed on the Linux news sites over The SCO Group's:
   http://ir.sco.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=99965 announcement that
   "it has created a new business division to manage the licensing of its
   UNIX intellectual property. The new division, called SCOsource, will
   manage the substantial UNIX intellectual property assets owned by SCO,
   and will operate an array of licensing programs."

   Some people have speculated this announcement is SCO's attempt to use
   software patents to extract royalties from Linux vendors. But when
   somebody starts blustering about "intellectual property" and doesn't
   cite a patent number, I wonder.

   Why hasn't anyone done some homework here? I went down to the
   Sunnyvale, California public library to do a search on the US Patent
   Office's CASSIS2 system. Here are some key dates:

     * November 1995: Unix System Laboratories Inc. assigns three patents
       to Novell: 5,652,854, 5,265,250 and 6,097,384. Apparently, Novell
       made sure to keep UNIX-related patents when selling the UNIX
       source code to the original SCO, whose full name was "Santa Cruz
       Operation Inc."
     * August 1998: Novell assigns the trademark "Unixware" to Santa Cruz
       Operation Inc., but assigns no patents. This is around the same
       time that Novell assigned the trademark "Unix" to the X/Open
       Company Ltd.
     * August 2000: Caldera announces intent to buy the SCO Server
       Software Division and the Professional Services Division from
       Santa Cruz Operation, Inc. Caldera held no patents at this time
       and still doesn't.
     * December 2001: Santa Cruz Operation Inc. changes its name to
       Tarantella Inc. Both of Santa Cruz Operation Inc.'s patents,
       6,104,392 and 6,362,836, stay with Tarantella.

   Novell has assigned away only seven patents since 1980, when the
   CASSIS2 records begin: two to Corel, one to Interlogis Inc. and three
   to Volera Inc. Caldera has never had a patent assigned to it.

   So, if SCO is interested in throwing the first stone in a licensing
   war, all they have to play with is copyright on UNIX source code. The
   only people who won't have to worry are GNU and Linux developers,
   distributors and users. The GNU Project has kept itself scrupulously
   clean of UNIX source code "taint" since the beginning, and Linux is a
   rewrite from scratch, not a direct descendant of UNIX, as is almost
   every other common OS. The threat to Linux from this SCOsource deal
   would have been patents, because a patent holder can sue someone who
   independently arrived at the same idea.

   This doesn't mean that software patents aren't still a potential
   problem for the whole industry, like rhyming word patents would be to
   poets. Are the large software patent holders simply waiting to file
   infringement suits until they can get Europe to go for US-style
   software patents?

   My main concern here is why didn't any of the news organizations that
   try to cover Linux do the patent search? In the time it takes to write
   some pointless speculation about nonexistent patents, someone could
   have done a search or gone to the library. Don't news organizations
   have researchers and editorial assistants any more? You don't even
   have to pay them; call them interns, give them bylines, and they'll
   work for free in exchange for learning how to cover the news.

   One more reason not to like the term "intellectual property":
   analogies between information and physical objects always break down.
   The weaker your analogy, the more evil you have to be to enforce it.

   More Editor Stuff

   What is the most common reason why I reject article ideas? Usually,
   it's because the article doesn't show the potential to make the reader
   capable of doing something after reading it that he or she couldn't
   have done before reading it.

   DMCA Update

   Rep. Zoe Lofgren has reintroduced her DMCA reform bill:
   http://www.house.gov/lofgren/news/2003/030304.htm. The Business
   Software Alliance promptly came out with a rant against it, which Rich
   Kulawiec helpfully translated:
   http://www.politechbot.com/p-04517.html from its original Corporate
   Newspeak:

     We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the RIAA and the MPAA in our
     willingness to criminalize any behavior that threatens our obscene
     profits, or which penalizes us in any way for our complete failure
     to anticipate changing market conditions, new technology, or
     overwhelming dissatisfaction with the crap we're selling."

   Write to Congress, and point out the important, legitimate things you
   need to do that the DMCA prevents you from doing. We need DMCA reform;
   if we can't do that, at least maybe we can keep the forces of evil
   tied up fighting DMCA reform and not pushing for the really heinous
   stuff, such as mandatory Digital Rights Management on all hardware. Or
   all TV-capable hardware, which--thanks to Moore's law--is everything
   you buy next year.

   Eric Blossom of GNU Radio rocked everyone's socks at CodeCon, with a
   full software implementation of HDTV. It's not real-time yet, but one
   clock doubling at the same time as a round of code tweaking should
   take care of that. Check out GNU Radio:
   http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuradio/gnuradio.html, and maybe you'll
   want to put off that expensive radio hardware purchase. It already can
   do multiple FM signals in real time.

   Random Question

   Is the lack of out-of-the-box hardware support for Linux an advantage,
   long-term, because it makes more people understand more about Linux
   and hardware? You lose some potential end users at the cost of
   subjecting some people to the first stage of developer or sysadmin
   training.

No reason to panic, Sean.  It just sounds like you accidentally modified the 
"Files" section of your XF86Config file so that the X server can't find your 
fonts.  Here is the corresponding section of XF86Config-4 from my system 
(Mandrake 8.2)

Section "Files"

    RgbPath     "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb"
    FontPath   "unix/:-1"

EndSection

The FontPath variable contains possible locations for fonts.  In my case (and 
it sounds like this is your case too), the X server acquires fonts via a font 
server xfs.  The number "-1" in my case and "700" in your case refers to the 
port that the font server uses.  Since the default port for the font server 
is 7100, my guess is that you accidentally deleted the 1 to end up with 700.  
If you were not using a font server, this variable would contain a list of 
directories where the X server should look for fonts.

You can determine what port your font server is running on by looking at the 
command line used to start the font server.  A quick and dirty way to do this 
is to read it from the process table, which you can do using the command

ps wp `ps aux | grep xfs | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'`

On my system, this shows that the font server was started with the command

xfs -port -1 -daemon -droppriv -user xfs

which indicates that the port that my font server is running on is -1.  If the 
command line does not contain the -port argument, then the font server is 
running on the default port of 7100.

For more information about the font server, look at the man page for xfs.  You 
could also look at the man page for XF86Config for more information about the 
configuration file.

Good luck,

Mark

P.S. Problems with the X server are not usually related to problems with a 
filesystem.  So, checking your filesystem wasn't really warranted.

Message-ID: <1046972519.3023.71.camel@sparticus.coopnkass.com>

Friends,

A bill will be introduced to the House of Representatives requiring that
State Government in Oregon consider "using open source software when
acquiring new software." You may find a link to the bill on Oregon's
legislative web site here:

  http://www.leg.state.or.us/03reg/measures/hb2800.dir/hb2892.intro.html

You may also find a link to Rob "Roblimo" Miller's write-up here:

  http://newsforge.com/newsforge/03/03/06/018222.shtml?tid=4

The bill is in good hands, but we need your support! I will post a draft
letter in the next few days for delivery to your local representative
about the bill, and why it is important for both the people of Oregon
and it's economy. I would like each of you to just spend a few moments
to modify the letter as you deem necessary and send it to the House
Representative in your local district. I will provide a list of contacts
in your area.

This bill is _very_ important to helping with the budget shortfall in
Oregon and encouraging our State Government to ensure a fair and
competitive process when procuring IT products and services.

If you have any questions or would like to get involved, please do let
me know.


Very Truly Yours,


Cooper Stevenson

Actually what I did is ran Xfree -configure and created a new XF86Config
file.  I replaced the old one with this new one and startx worked in
root.  HOWEVER, when I tried to launch startx in my user account it
returned an error.

When I looked at the new file, I noticed it was very different that the
original and missing a lot of data, but it had more font info.  I edited
the new file to include the missing data of the original and it wouldn't
boot stating the screen info couldn't be found.

I have returned to the new file and trying to figure out why startx
won't work in the user account.  

The info you provided is awesome and I am going to check it out.  I
don't really mind breaking this and fixing it again.  My intention is to
learn and this is the fastest way I know how.  At least in this case I
am not messing around on someone else's network.

No reason to panic, Sean.  It just sounds like you accidentally modified
the 
"Files" section of your XF86Config file so that the X server can't find
your 
fonts.  Here is the corresponding section of XF86Config-4 from my system

(Mandrake 8.2)

Section "Files"

    RgbPath     "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb"
    FontPath   "unix/:-1"

EndSection

The FontPath variable contains possible locations for fonts.  In my case
(and 
it sounds like this is your case too), the X server acquires fonts via a
font 
server xfs.  The number "-1" in my case and "700" in your case refers to
the 
port that the font server uses.  Since the default port for the font
server 
is 7100, my guess is that you accidentally deleted the 1 to end up with
700.  
If you were not using a font server, this variable would contain a list
of 
directories where the X server should look for fonts.

You can determine what port your font server is running on by looking at
the 
command line used to start the font server.  A quick and dirty way to do
this 
is to read it from the process table, which you can do using the command

ps wp `ps aux | grep xfs | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'`

On my system, this shows that the font server was started with the
command

xfs -port -1 -daemon -droppriv -user xfs

which indicates that the port that my font server is running on is -1.
If the 
command line does not contain the -port argument, then the font server
is 
running on the default port of 7100.

For more information about the font server, look at the man page for
xfs.  You 
could also look at the man page for XF86Config for more information
about the 
configuration file.

Good luck,

Mark

P.S. Problems with the X server are not usually related to problems with
a 
filesystem.  So, checking your filesystem wasn't really warranted.

Stupid question, but how do I launch it in terminal.  I found the file
in /usr/bin but get the error Gtk-Warning **: cannot open display

To make things even more interesting, I had to reconfigure my XF86config
file because xWindows would not boot.  I got startx to work in root, but
not in my user account.

I tried Evolution in my root account and it worked.

Now I am scratching my head.  Isn't the XF86config file that root is
using, the same one the user account accesses?  Why would startx work in
one and not the other?

The error I get is:
Error loading keymap /var/tmp/server-0.xkm
Couldn't load XKB keymap, falling back to pre-XKB keymap
Mkdtemp: private socket dir: No space left on device

If you are not getting any error messages, you might consider launching
evolution from a terminal to see if you get any error messages there. 
When I corrected the two files I mentioned earlier, everything worked
fine.

Cooper,

  What does this do that the DAS guidelines don't do? The Dept. of
Administrative Services has already told state agencies it's OK for them to
use FOSS.

Holy cow!  
/dev/hda2	size=11G  	Used=11G  	Avail=0	Use=100%
Mounted on=/
/dev/hda1	size=100M	Used=19M	Avail=76M	Use=20%
Mounted on=/boot
None		size=62M	Used=0	Avail=61M	Use=0%	Mounted
on=/dev/shm	

How could I possibly use up 11G?

Message-ID: <GGEILBHDNBMGHFFFEIGOEEFDNHAA.mikel@quantecllc.com>

Hi, pluggers.

I have a machine that I've added a NIC to, bringing the total to 3. I am now
scratching my head on how to tell Linux that there's another NIC to
configure/install. I already have one NIC card of that model installed and
working.

Help? :)

What kind of NIC is it, exactly? Many times the module for the NIC will
have a switch that indicates which card you wish for it to be.

If the NIC driver is built into the kernel, on the other hand, it may be
a simple matter as follows:

  ifconfig eth2 192.168.1.x netmask 255.255.255.0
  ifconfig eth2 up

It's a 3COM 3c509? I think...

I do the ifconfig and get:

[root at www mike]# ifconfig eth2 10.0.0.22 netmask 255.255.255.0
SIOCSIFADDR: No such device
eth2: unknown interface: No such device
SIOCSIFNETMASK: No such device

Hmmmm.....

Well, if it's an ISA nic you need to add a lilo parameter for built in driver 
or try /etc/modules.conf for a modular driver.  If it's pci, most likely, you
should be able to do dmesg to find out if it detected.  On redhat there
are scripts under /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts where you should
find ifcfg-eth0.  You copy this file and modify it for your third net card.
I believe that ifconfig -a is another way to see if Linux knows about 
your third net card regardless of whether or not it is up.

  Easy. Large temporary files. Now run (as root):

ls -l / | less

and you'll see what's taking all that space on the root filesystem.

Rich,

I logged on to IRMD's web sight looking for the DAS guidelines. At first
glance, I did not see anything related directly to Open Source. I have
called the IRMD. They put me to the Purchasing department. I left a
message with the manager.

I will follow up as soon as I receive word.

'k. I can see in the dmesg where the eth0 and eth1 are detected, but not
eth2. In modules.conf, I have aliases for eth0, eth1, and eth2 - all point
to eepro100.

I looked at the ifcfg-eth2: it had the same IP as the ifcfg-eth1. I fixed it
(and fixed one of my other problems - slow logons & transfers - thanks
Mike!) but now I do ifconfig on eth2 and get:

eth2: error fetching interface information: Device not found

Mike,

Send me the output of the following commands:

   dmesg
   lsmod

In the mean time, here's a hint from
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/modules.txt:

        alias eth0 3c509        # or whatever net adapter you have
        # you might need an "options" line for some net adapters:
        options 3c509 io=0x300 irq=10

Cooper,

  I forwarded a message to that effect last week. It should be in the PLUG
list archives.

  From Saturday, 22 Feb 2003:

DAS (Department of Administrative Services) has initiated a new email
address for citizens to send questions, suggestions about new ideas to save
the state money, ways to improve government, etc.

Here is the address:  govconnect at das.state.or.us

  NO! Some applications look for files there.

  But, you can delete all pdf, PDF, ~ and so on with impunity.

Sean,

Here is a command that will (fairly) safely delete all files in your
/tmp directory that are older than 5 days old.

The operative here is "fairly." There is the potential for this command
to remove files in directories other than /tmp. There is every chance
this will happen if you type the command in incorrectly. PLEASE BE
CERTAIN YOU HAVE TYPED THIS COMMAND EXACTLY AS I HAVE TYPED IT:

  find /tmp -atime +5 -exec rm -rf {} \;

If you are squeemish and wish to manually "okay" each file before it is
removed from your system enter the following at the command prompt:

  find /tmp -atime +5 -exec ok {} \;

The above will ask you for verification to make sure you wish to delete
the files this command finds. Some distributions have an alias for 'rm'
to do this by default. In effect the first command may ask you for
verification if your distribution is set up this way.

I did and it is.

I removed 10M from /tmp and all seem good.  Startx works in root and
user and even Evolution boots now.  I am still troubled, however, that
hd2 is full already (11G) and I don't have anything on this computer
except RH8 and zero files aside from those that were loaded with the
program.

Now I am trying to figure out what I can delete.

This legislation will require Open Source Software to be considered
right along with proprietary offerings for procuring IT client and
server software.

This legislation was introduced to help reduce costs associated with IT
spending. With the advent of Microsoft's subscription-based licencing
fees, this cost will reach millions for not only Windows but also of
Microsoft's Office products as well.

I sometimes find an apprehension to converting to Open Source software.
There is generally no argument that Open Source is more stable and
secure, and that support options are generally more than adequate.

I find two primary reasons for not wishing to migrate. The first is
simply the unwillingness to change. IT managers would rather keep their
jobs, thank you very much.

Even if it costs the taxpayers millions.

The second reason is a more insidious. I offer a brief rundown of what
often happens when IT managers who do consider the use of Open Source
Software in this simple, easy-to-follow, five step program:


  Step One: Large organization considers using Open Source for their IT
infrastructure

  Step Two: Large Organization receives mail or a "compliance visit"
from Microsoft.

  Step Three: Microsoft either threatens or actually performs an audit
through the BSA

  Step Four: The audit costs the company several hindered thousand
dollars

  Step Five: Linux/Unix administrators get their pink slips to cover the
cost of the audit and businesses write in the costs for next year's
budget as a loss.

Meanwhile, Senior citizens are taking their blood pressure on the steps
of the State Capitol building.

References are available upon request about the preceding process.

These steps for private enterprise, while underhanded, are fine--it's
business.

When we're talking about taxpayer money, though, it's different. We
Oregonians are facing a budget shortfall in the Billions--yes, that's
with a big 'B.'

I have heard the argument over and over again that Open Source does not
actually lower Total Cost of Ownership. This is simply not true. 

Ask Merrill Lynch, Reuters, Amazon.com, Sherman Williams, Winnebago, the
State of Florida, and on and on. Don't just take my word for it. Look at
their (except for Florida's) SEC filings.

One of the studies pointed out by the opponents of Open source is a
study performed last year by IDG. It was funded by Microsoft. It
basically said that over the past five years, Linux reduced TCO in some
areas but actually increased it in others.

Chief among the flaws in the study is that they did not amortize out the
_next_ five years including Microsoft's licencing 6. When you then take
into account the perpetual licencing costs of both the Operating System
and of the Suite (not to mention the cost of the OS when you buy the PC
or server in the first place), Linux starts to look real cheap. Real
fast.

Note also as one IDG director observed, "you have to remember that those
companies that sponsor these studies stack the deck in such a way that
you'd never see that kind of configuration in the real world."

I estimate that $10,000 p/1000 machines are spent on personnel keeping
track of software licences alone!

The bottom line is that our State government is shipping money by the
truckload to Washington State and Texas, and it is having a direct
effect on our ability to offer badly needed funds to citizens that could
really use it.

Finally, I think Oregon has a law prohibiting it's entities from doing
business with convicted felons...so what are we doing dealing with
Microsoft?

I have been tasked with finding someone for a project.

The project will involve helping introduce and roll out Linux to a company and
to ramp up a Linux development
environment based on Java. Networking and Linux system administration will be
key.

It isn't going to be a massive project, it will be in the Portland area, and
the rate isn't too bad.

Anybody interested?

Message-ID: <20030306233459.22066.qmail@ns1.robinson-west.com>

Most backup references I find talk about dump, restore, 
tar, etc.  However, they seem to assume that your backup 
device is directly connected to the machine you want to 
back up.  For a multiple server/workstation environment 
this makes no sense whatsoever because of cost.  The 
option of moving a dump drive around in a bracket doesn't 
make much sense either as this movement wears out a 
hard drive and lowers the efficiency of backing up multiple 
machines.  As far as I can tell, a linux system cannot be 
completely backed up, everything, live.  There's runlevel 
one, however there is no network access in this mode. 
Without network access, there's no way to dump to a 
remote dump drive or directly to a remote tape :-o

To the end of being able to do a full backup of not only 
windows systems but also of Linux systems, I've managed 
to make a netbootable image of the most recent Tom's boot 
root disk.  Unfortunately, this Linux system doesn't have 
backup tools including rmt and is not capable of mounting a 
samba share to dump to.  The other problem with Tom's Root 
boot is root access without authentication to the machine it 
is booted on.  It doesn't seem to me that Tom's has that 
many network tools, don't know what what the maximum 
extent of Tom's capabilities are as far as network goes 
though.  If I can figure out how to make my own initrd 
system I'll make that netbootable :-)  Fortunately, the 
1.44 meg limitation on Tom's root boot doesn't exist for 
etherboot images which can expand to sixteen megs 
when they are loaded into ram.  Rumor has it that people 
have done 180 meg images, I'd use nfs myself before I'd 
load that much into ram unless I had a clever way to
detect that there's enough memory for an image of that
size.  I could use suggestions on what will help me 
learn how to build initrd linux systems that can be 
tagged for network booting.  I didn't modify Tom's, I 
just tagged it.  It would be nice to test initrd systems 
without having to reboot the developement machine
to try and netboot them.  

With etherboot is there a way for me to password 
Tom's Root boot or should I change the root 
password in the netbootable image itself?



Thoughts for an advanced network based backup system.
------------------------------------------

In an advanced setup you network boot into a boot/restore 
system, but you have to authenticate as yourself and the 
backup software available knows what backup, partitioning, 
and restore procedures are valid for you.   Whether or not 
a blank tape that you can claim or your own tape is loaded 
in the tape drive, whether the machine you are going into 
network backup from is open to your modifying it, and this 
net backup program limits the user's activity to the 
machine they boot it on.  

The Linux system is the obvious choice because it can mount 
just about any PC operating system's partitions, user 
seperation is available through standard accounts, the 
networking capability is there, and 
there are ample scripting options.  Ideally, an experience 
similar to menuconfig where you never get a normal 
console prompt makes the most sense.  I've had good luck
using dump and then tar and bzip2 to get the backups
onto my DI30 tapes.

The trick is figuring out which machine the network backup 
program is loading up on and applying that information to the 
authentication process.  While special methods of writing to 
tape are possible, this makes it more difficult to restore.  I 
think a non tamper resistant text file at the beginning of the 
tape that has the mac address of the machine backed up 
makes the most sense for a home environment.  To keep 
this simple, you would have one or more tapes per 
machine even if all your machines would fit on one tape.  
I guess I could write a text file to a new tape that indicates 
the user name of the person that can claim it and only allow 
the administrator to claim a tape that is truly blank.  The
mac address on the tape connects it to a machine where
authentication connects a machine to a person or standard
user.

For what I want in a backup system it keeps 
multiple peoples' backup jobs from exceeding the dump 
space, it implements first come first serve so that backup 
requests are served in the order they are recieved, and
backups are split over multiple tapes if they are too large
for one tape where backup size is calculated  before starting 
so that backup doesn't become unavailable for everyone 
while you rush to the store, or favorite web site, to order 
more media and find the administrator to check
it out to you.  I'm playing with the simplification of not 
allowing more than one backup job to be served at a time
because my dump space isn't two to three times my tape
space or better.

An advanced network backup environment is ready for
more efficient backup methods that use things such as
kickstart, etc.  I want ot get backed up what I have now
first before exploring the methods recommended
in many of the bare metal recovery howto's more 
closely.  Reinstalling can reduce backup size but
I'm worried about missing important changes, etc.

Netbooting involves dhcp giving host information based
on the mac address.  This is what I want to add to the
authentication information later when a person logs in
with some username and password and the system
has to decide if the person they logged in as is allowed
to modify the system they logged in from.

It _is_ Oregon's problem, because we have to pay for it. We not only
with taxpayer money but also with _every_ good and service that we
consume as the costs to the manufacturer/service provider are passed to
the consumer.

This bill is the first step toward promoting fair procurement processes.
In terms of problem one, history tells us that IT managers will often
choose what is easiest, even if they know a better solution exists. This
will force public sector IT employees to justify why they chose the
solution that they have. While it's true it does not directly address
problem number one, it does indirectly require them to think more about
the technology in terms of what is better and less expensive for their
employers/customers, and less about what is easiest for them.

but I see the relevance to problem 2.  If you force

I cannot speak to the intentions of the bill's author, but I can tell
you that it is definitely a potential benefit.

The state will now have the power to say, "hey, proprietary vendor,
that's the law!" By inference, if the proprietary vendor does not wish
to play ball nicely, then it is certainly justified for an IT manager to
write in his/her report, "we felt a very real threat from proprietary
vendor X that they intend to enforce strict licensing guidelines against
our software. Staying in compliance of these terms may be outside the
limits of our resources to track and pay for these licencing
requirements. We have no reason at this time to suspect that this
situation will change in the future."

I agree to a certain extent. What you may not know is that lobbyists
from Redmond are pouring _millions_ into the pockets of some
legislators' re-election funds across the country to help, "ensure that
software used by the public sector is of the highest technical and
functional standard." 

Do the math.

The boom times are over. Constituents in each district are taking a real
hard look at where the money is going. This is a good thing.

If Linux has such dramatic potential to
> reduce costs as you claim, it should "sell" based on its own merits.

History will tell you, young man, that it is simply not always the case.
The death of the Macintosh is an excellent example. On the business
side, I encourage you to look at the Anti-trust cases of Standard Oil
and Carnege Steel, Microsoft, and others.

This you may not know:

Bill Gates grew up in the upper-crust suburban Seattle in the 1960's.
His father, William Gates Jr., was one of Seattle's most prominent
lawyers and an active player in the political arena in Washington State.
Senators, congressmen, and governors came to dinner at the family's
house when Bill was a boy.

It was actually Bill's mother, Mary, who pointed a friendly IBM
executive to her son's fledgling software company, Microsoft.

Is William Gates III an intelligent and intense individual? Certainly.
Does he have a ferocious competitive appetite? Again, certainly.

Did he have a little help? I'd say that's a fair statement to say the
least.

I wish it really were a "may the best man win" business, but the truth
is that the technology sector is a rough, 'take-no-prisoners' arena
where you take every advantage that you can get. For some, even if said
advantage is illegal.

Michael,

Well, as you are probably aware of, many commercial backup solutions have
special add-ons for backing up live databases. If you don't go with one of
those then the best option is to script dumping the db to a file and then
that dump gets backed up to tape.

Look into AMANDA at www.amanda.org

It may fulfill many of your desires. It will back up linux boxes as well
as SMB shares. It also has the ability to separate the server software
from the tape drive. IOW, you can have the server run on box A, have the
tape drive (or changer) in box B, and back up C,D,..... Amanda has a very
active, helpful mailing list in which some of the developers pipe in now
and then.

Currently i'm having problems regarding our email users. we are running RH
as our mail server and Postfix as the MTA, email users were given (by the
previous admin) an 8 character long randomly generated passwd.  my problem
is some of the users forgot their password, but i have no list of the passwd
given by the previous admin. as a result i give them new one.  I would like
to ask anyone if it is possible to print or get alist form our server of all
the users with their corresponding passwd?

TIA

If they are randomly generated, most likely the answer is "no".  (Not 
without spending a lot of CPU time guessing.)

Better off just resetting the passwords to something else and give them a 
new password.

Salt to taste to pipe over ssh for remote backups.

Note: because files change between backup and compare, the compare is
going to generate some mismatch noise.  I generally glance at the

You might try John the Ripper. 
http://freshmeat.net/projects/john/?topic_id=43%2C44%2C253%2C857%2C861

Although, with randomly generated passwords, it might take a while. If it 
was possible to get the passwords out that easily, what's the point? If you 
can do it, so can a cracker.

The username, yes. The password, no. What's stored is a hash of the 
password. How it's compared is the user input to the password prompt is 
hashed, and the hashes are compared.

John the Ripper 
(http://freshmeat.net/projects/john/?topic_id=43%2C44%2C253%2C857%2C861) 
will crack many passwords, but it's going to take a long time on something 
thats completely random (i.e. a GOOD password).

If it were this easy there would be no security.  /etc/passwd is world readable.
For many years RH (the disto in question) has been using shadow passwords. 
The whole point is that the encoding is non-reversable.  What's wrong with

$ passwd poor_user_with_a_random_password EasyToRememberPassWord

or are you trolling?

Typically, I dump my databases/directory to files and then backup, which
means the state of the actual database files doesn't matter.

Are you running Redhat (I forgot if you mentioned it earlier).

Here's a document that walks you through the process. It's mostly painless. 
I did it the other day on one of my servers.

But you can safely empty it on reboot (as long as you yourself don't put
stuff there you expect to live past reboot).  I put this in my
/etc/fstab:

none                    /tmp                    tmpfs   defaults        0 0

Assuming you've got a reasonable amount of memory, this will make /tmp
work entirely out of memory, which (might) also speed (a few) things
up.  If you find big files getting stuff left there, you can find if
anything is actually using them with 'lsof' or 'fuser'.  (And if
something actually does have them open, the file blocks won't actually
be released until the file is closed.)

Subject: [PLUG] immediate shutdown problem
Message-ID: <20030307061221.GA20305@silver.CS.ORST.EDU>

Twice I've had my workstation poweroff un-commanded (the last two
times it was shutdown infact). Both times this has happened at the
same instant I've placed my visor in it's usb cradel. Has anyone
experienced this? AFAIK, I don't have any resident monitors on my
cradel, and I know I didn't inadvertently hit the hotsync button (nor
does this do anything yet, I haven't set that up, the cradel just acts
as a charging station.)

Cradeling the visor is something I do daily, and has never seemed to
cause a problem other than these two instances, about 2-3 weeks apart.

Both times the system was doing quite a lot, with a load average
arround 3 (I check this rather often), and high disk activity. This
leads me to think it may be powering off automatically due to heat
problems.. although it's a hell of a coincidence. Unfortunately I
don't have any thermal sensing software working.. 

Anyhow, the system specs are as follows (in detail to support the
overheating theory):

dual athlon mp 1600+'s
tyan tiger mpx mobo
512 ram
dvd, cdrw, cd (separate devices, all ide)
promise ata100 ide controller
3 dma 100 drives (and a slower one, that never sees activity)
G400 DH. video 
450 watt antex PS.
& 4 case fans.
 
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

tethereal is part of the ethereal source. You probably could do this with
tcpdump, but tethereal is my tool of choice. http://www.ethereal.com/

On the pop server run this for a few days / weeks ?

Explain to them that good security depends on them changing their
passwords periodically, and that the costliest of security breaches are
internal.

Too bad for your users! No admin on any properly-managed modern system can 
recover a password, the only option is to reset it. Passwords should not be 
readable by human eyes. Though Russell pointed out how easy it is to capture 
and read network traffic. A little encryption goes a long way towards curing 
that. Some users are chronically whiny about passwords, the only things I 
know to do are to streamline the system so they don't need to track a bunch 
of passwords, and to be very stern on anything pertaining to security. No 
Post-its, no dictionary words, birthdays, or pet names; periodic password 
changes, no recycling the same three passwords, the usual basics.

Given that he's got a .ph domain, I'd guess Oregon laws aren't very
important to him.

That's an education issue. Explain to them that you do not keep a record of 
their password due to security and legal concerns. Also tell them that 
there is no way to "recover" a lost password, as that would make the 
security of their account questionable, at best. The only option is to 
issue a new password, if the old one is lost, and tell them that they are 
responsible for remembering their passwords.

You also need

Okay, I'll be the shmoo who asks- why do you top post, when you post a link to 
'Why is Bottom-posting better than Top-posting'?

I'll settle for people following the already-established pattern- what's 
seriously annoying is trying to follow a message composed in an kaleidoscopic 
blend of top- and bottom-posts.

Subject: [PLUG] Write Your Legislator
Message-ID: <1047059543.5120.111.camel@sparticus.coopnkass.com>

Friends,

What follows are instructions and a simple template for writing your
Representatives about the Open Source Consideration bill (HB 2892) that
is currently headed for committee in the House. You may find a link to
the bill here:

  http://www.leg.state.or.us/03reg/measures/hb2800.dir/hb2892.intro.html

It turns out that writing to your House or Senate Representative has
never been easier! Simply go the URL below, fill out your name and
address in the fields provided, and write what you wish to say in the
text box area of the page!

  http://www.leg.state.or.us/writelegsltr/writeset.htm

Your email will be automatically sent to the appropriate
representative(s) based on the address you provided! I have included a
template below. Really, though, write what you feel is important. For
goodness sakes, though, please write!


---------------------------Begin Letter---------------------------------

HB 2892

I am in support of HB 2892. This bill would require State agencies in
Oregon to consider Open Source Software when procuring Information
Technology goods and services. While I am not necessarily opposed to
proprietary software, Open Source software is truly a big win for Oregon
as it's legislators shop for alternatives.

This bill will help save the State of Oregon millions in IT licensing
costs and software expenditures. These funds could be used to improve
Oregon's IT infrastructure or diverted to other services that the
citizens of Oregon desperately need.

Thank you for your consideration in this matter. HB 2892 truly is an
important bill that would benefit the people of the State of Oregon.


Sincerely,



---------------------------End Letter----------------------------------


Guidelines for writing your representative:

  * Have the bill number prominantly displayed at the top of the letter
and in bold 

  * Have the words "I support" in bold in the first sentance of the
letter

  * Include your address with the letter so that your representative can
clearly see that you live in his/her district

  * Be honest. Say what you feel. Provide evidence in your own
experience how Open Source software has saved you or your company money,
increased reliability/security, whatever

Writing your representative shouldn't be a big deal, and it isn't.
Believe it or not they really do listen to what they're constituents are
thinking and feeling. 

Each House Representative has an individual file for each bill going
through the various stages as on it's way to law. Your letters go into
that file. 

Every morning, an assistant will look at the bills that are to be
brought before his or her canidate's committee or to the floor for a
vote. This person looks at your letters in that file and takes a tally
of the "yea's" and "nea's." This is why it is important to have the bill
number in bold at the top of the page and the words, "I support" in
bold. They then pass this information on to the representative so that
he/she can get a feel for how to vote on a particular issue.

So you see, your letters _really_ do count! Let's get this thing passed
into law!

Finally, for future reference I should note that if you wish to contact
nearly any Oregon official for any reason, you may conveniently do so
here:

  http://www.kxl.com/lars_feedback.asp

Lars Larson's site has a complete drop-down list of just about every
representative you can think of. It's easy to fire off an email to any
of these officials and tell them what you think.

If you have any questions or would like further information, please do
not hesitate to contact me directly.


Very Truly Yours,

Because I'm trying to train myself... Unfortunately, it's a bad habit that 
I picked up long ago, and I'm trying to break...

It probably stems from my Fidonet days where all the editors would quote 
the message and put my cursor at the top. My Fidonet days started in 1985 
and continue to this day. :)

I actually try to do as I've done here, and quote your most recent message 
(w/any background that may be needed) and post my reply at the bottom... At 
least, that's my plan, and I'm sticking to it. :)

All,

HB-2892 News Update
-------------------

*  I am scheduled to appear on The Linux Show March 18! I will be
discussing HB-2892 now going to committee in Oregon's House of
Representatives. 

*  I am working with the Oregon Department of Information Technologies
to obtain an estimate of the number of PC's and servers used in the
State of Oregon. I just received a call from the department indicating
that I will receive the quarterly reports by the middle of next week!
These reports will help us gauge exactly how much savings the State can
expect to realize over the next 2-5 years. 

* I am organizing a "lobby day" at the State Capitol building in Salem.
I NEED YOUR HELP! It should be just a couple of hours at the beginning
of April. The more of you the better. Don't worry, I have an experienced
associate who works at the House who will help you through this. She's a
real firecracker and will have you fired up about the bill in no time!

You will get the chance to meet your Representatives face to face! Let's
let them know that we can save them money!

If you would like to volunteer please send me an email and together
we'll get this thing moved through the House!


Best,

I think your best bet might have been a parking structure.

Does anybody know what PSU's rules are for after-hours parking structure
use?

There's also a few non-PSU parking structures withing walking distance. 
One is over by the fire department by the Wells Fargo a few blocks
over... I want to say East three or so blocks.  Another is North several
blocks.  I don't remember what time the PLUG meetings are, though (can't
make them myself as Thursday nights are always busy)... so can't be of
too much help.  :-)

Message-ID: <33553.63.105.27.245.1047062298.squirrel@skua.ahapala.net>

I've got a stock RH8.0 box set up and it seems that the rpm binary(ies) is
whacked. No matter what command I enter the process just sleeps until
killed, this includes the rpm cronjob entry that happens daily.

My first thought was to "rpm --rebuilddb" but that hung. The following
commands have had the same effect:

rpm -q...   (any queries, qa, ql <pkg>)
rpm -Uvh <local rpm file>
up2date

My last resort I guess will be to reboot the machine since it is not in my
office and in use at the moment.

Any suggestions?

TIA,
Keith

Obviously my lack of perl knowledge is showing but I ran this command in
a directory with files of the name 'DS_Store' and as far as I could tell
nothing happened.  I took out the '-ls' and still could see no effect.

Sean,

Here is a command that will (fairly) safely delete all files in your
/tmp directory that are older than 5 days old.

The operative here is "fairly." There is the potential for this command
to remove files in directories other than /tmp. There is every chance
this will happen if you type the command in incorrectly. PLEASE BE
CERTAIN YOU HAVE TYPED THIS COMMAND EXACTLY AS I HAVE TYPED IT:

  find /tmp -atime +5 -exec rm -rf {} \;

If you are squeemish and wish to manually "okay" each file before it is
removed from your system enter the following at the command prompt:

  find /tmp -atime +5 -exec ok {} \;

The above will ask you for verification to make sure you wish to delete
the files this command finds. Some distributions have an alias for 'rm'
to do this by default. In effect the first command may ask you for
verification if your distribution is set up this way.


-Cooper

Check the binary size against what should be there.

Maybe run md5sum on it and compare it to somebody else on the list.  Oh,
wait, I (unfortunately) inhereted a RH 8.0 box... here's my output:

[root at gate2hell root]# rpm --version
RPM version 4.1
[root at gate2hell root]# md5sum `which rpm`
912add6d3d415c5d6c0fc5115f830b71  /bin/rpm
[root at gate2hell root]# ls -l `which rpm`
-rwxr-xr-x    1 rpm      rpm       2083816 Sep  4  2002 /bin/rpm

Yep.  I'm running as root.  Bad Rob. Bad, bad, bad Rob.....

If they don't match up, you might want to take a gander at chkrootkit.

Although, I guess I don't really know if that box has been rooted or
not.  Oh well.  :-)

  I've looked on 'fixyourownprinter.com' and searched google without result.
I hope someone here can help me.

  My LJ5 is printing a sloppy black edge on the right side of each page. I'm
sure the monster just needs a cleaning, but I've no idea what to clean or
what to use to clean it. The smudges are probably toner built up on
something, but I'm no hardware repair person so I don't know where to start.

All suggestions greatly appreciated,

There are laser cleaning sheets at your local office supply. They're not cheap, 
but they will clean up loose cruftage floating around in your laser, then fuse 
them onto the sheet.

I've never had much luck with them cleaning up an error that shows up for more 
than an eight of an inch long, it might be a fuser....

Since this box is on a trusted network that was low on the list but the
md5sums do match. It matches your md5sum too, so at least that file isn't
r00ted :-)

Matt,

Note that the character after `ls' and before ` perl' is a pipe (vertical
bar), not the letter "l". `find2perl' generates a Perl script on stdout. You
can pipe it to perl, or redirect it to a file if you want to create the
script for future invocations. If you had the pipe correct, then the `find'
failed to find anything.

  This is a series of smuges along the right edge. As if it's on a roller
somewhere in the system.

  The sheets are probably cheaper than a service call for a first
approximation to a fix.

stale locks! I should have thought of that. I think in the distant past
I've had to do that before.

For the record, clearing the __db* files in /var/lib/rpm fixed the problem.

Thanks Sandy!

Are they directories or files?  If files, they should have been
removed.  If directories, you need to use rmdir instead of unlink.

Look in /usr/lib/rpm for a bunch of temporary database files.  (They will 
end in .001 .002 and .003.)  Delete and/or rename them.  That should fix 
the problem.

It is a known bug, but never fixed in the mainline version of 8.0.

Subject: [PLUG] OpenOffice config problem
Message-ID: <F54u1lF3I9lQmflpSjz000100c4@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

Hopefully, there is someone on the list that is using
OpenOffice and can answer my question.

I have been using OpenOffice on my Redhat box
for a while and it works great.  RedHat box
does have printer configuration to several
different HP laser jets in office.  Printing
(from non OpenOffice docs) is doing just fine.

So yesterday, I decided to add printers into OpenOffice
so I can print out the docs from within.  I fired up
spadmin, and added 4 printers to it.  Command I gave it
was:

   lp -d <printer name>

So I press print, only the banner page came out.  The document
itself was not printed.  Then when I modified it to:

    lp -d <printer name> -o nobanner

Nothing came out.  Yet, on stdout, the standard print job
being queued message (with the queue id) is printed out
everytime I press print.  But printer received nothing,
the data light did not even blink for a second. I verified by issuing lp -d 
<printer name> on my .bashrc file and
the file did get printed.

Any tips much appreciated...

--Vincent

Thanks, Matt. I hadn't seen the discussion but I had done everything on
the list already. It's very frustrating since Sendmail resolves
localhost.lankow.net as my outside IP but a simple ping resolves it
internally by virtue of my /etc/hosts entry.

As I recall, sendmail doesn't use the /etc/hosts file. It only resolves via 
DNS. I've run into this previously.

What I believe it's doing is looking up the MX record for lankow.net, since 
this would be the host it would be interested in. Since there is no MX 
record for localhost.lankow.net, it goes to lankow.net. If you want it to 
find your internal host, then you'll either need to define an internal 
network for it to find in DNS, or use localhost by itself, without the 
lankow.net after it.

I may be all wet here, but I believe that's the behavior I've encountered 
previously.

Russ, I believe you hit upon it. With previous versions of Sendmail (Red
Hat 6.2, for example) the log entry would not include lankow.net ... it
would just say 'localhost'. If I could figure out why the newer sendmail
is tacking on the lankow.net, I would have my problem solved.

When the email is submitted, the relay is root at localhost - this is

Subject: [PLUG] natural join on text files
Message-ID: <86heaealvu.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I've got a text file which consists of lines of three space-delimited
numbers.  Each of these lines constitutes a key for "interesting"
lines of a second text file.  The first three fields in the second
file in the "interesting" lines will match one of the lines in the
first file.  This is essentially a "natural join" operation from
relational database land, but on text files.

As root, check out the following files:

  /etc/bashrc
  /root/.bashrc

Less likely you are using the Korne shell:

  /etc/kshrc
  /root/.kshrc

You should see something like:

  alias rm -rf='rm -rif'

Remove this alias and (possibly) re-login.

DISCLAIMER: Doing this may someday cause you grief. The Linux 'rm'
command, just like about everything else in Linux, will do _exactly_
what you tell it too. No "are you sure" dialog boxes, no "you are about
to do something silly" messages, just the absolute command.

'rm' will absolutely trash your system without even the common courtesy
of a ..err, you get the picture.

So if you're feeling manly--if you think you got what it takes, you just
remove those 'wimpy' lines from your *rc files, the sky's the limit!

Here's what I've come up with:

  $ awk '{ printf("$1 == %d && $2 == %d && $3 == %d { print $0 }\n",$1,$2,$3) }' file1 | awk -f - file2 

I need this kind of thing *all-the-/sbin/fsck-ing-time*, you'd think I

Randal> "man join"?  

"join" doesn't seem to handle multiple "index" fields, so I'd have to
munge them together and then probably demunge them on output, but that
could work.  I was hoping to avoid that.

Or am I missing something?

Randal> "man paste"?

Yes, definitely useful in the grand scheme.

Interesting, but not robust enough.  What happens if the key in file1
doesn't appear at the beginning of the line in file2?  E.g.:

7 1 2 3

in file2 would match the grep pattern "1 2 3" from file1, as would:

11 2 3 43

I could send file1 through some "armoring" filter, with a "^" and the
front and a delimiter at the end and pipe it like:

  $ <filter> file1 | grep -f - file2

The program YTree probably put it there.

And, here is what seems to be a suitable filter and command-line:

  $ sed 's/^\(.*\)[ ]*$/^\1($| )/' file1 | egrep -f - file2

I'll stipulate that I don't care about whitespace at the end of line
in file1, since it is mostly invisible and caring about it seems more
likely to cause confusion.  

In order to match lines that begin with my key and then either end or
have a delimiter followed by other data, I need (?) an optional, such
as ($| ) in egrep syntax.

Comments?

  Well, they say that memory is the first thing to go when the computer
ages.

You really think that this is easier than doing it in perl?

You probably got RPM'ed, where an RPM has it but there's no way to find
out during install/upgrade what's really there.  I used to have
mkpasswd on my server, but after installing an upgrade RPM it disappeared,
reading back through the logs on RH's website showed that it got taken
out, but not why.  They probably want me to fill out a survey of buy
a professional version to get it :)

Colin,

  Could be, but I think I put it on some time ago to try and completely
forgot about it. I just got rid of all of it.

  But, I've just hit a Red Hat rpm problem that is the final straw -- for
me. I got the official PostgreSQL rpms for the latest 7.3.2 (even rebuilt
the src.rpm here) and I cannot upgrade the current version. Wrong
architecture I'm told. Sigh.

  This weekend I'm -- finally -- putting Slackware-8.0 on my notebook,
assembling my new (fast!) workstation, and putting Slack on that, too.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with Red Hat, but after 5+ years of using
it I've decided that it's not the best for _me_ here. I've had too many bad
experiences with missing dependencies and other time consuming issues. This
is not intended to start another distribution diatribe! I've just made a
decision based on our use on the small network here.

a) I never said that my reasons for avoiding Perl had to do with
   "easier"; and

b) it would be interesting to see whether a Perl solution really was
   "easier".  Got one you'd like to nominate?

Subject: [PLUG] HTTP protocol Question
Message-ID: <2510.134.244.174.61.1047084255.squirrel@sautez.com>

Hello all,

I'm tracking down some info on how the HTTP protocol should work. Ok, it
is more then that but here is the jest of my question.  I'll try to
explain this so that you understand.

I have web server which on a link I have it process a request and then use
the Location: header to have the request sent to another server.  This
server then returns the process request to me.  Which in this case is a
file. A text file actually.

In this case both servers are running on the same host but different ports.

In the second server it tries to get the port number of the request so
that it may include that in the file I created.  I need that to process
the text file returned.  However, what I have found is that the server
running on the second port does not have access to the Port.  The first
server did not send it with the Location: header.  It appears to have not
included it in the protocol.  The Host header (when viewed in a tunnel is
just the host).

I have Apache as the first server and Tomcat as the second.  Tomcat uses
the HTTP request to get the port.  It can't find it on the request and
thus uses its port which is not the correct port I need.

Is this normal?  Is there a problem with Apache or Tomcat?  I think not as
I have a TCPMonitor java program that also appears to strip the port when
redirecting and HTTPClient libraries also do that.

Thanks for any help you can give.  I'm about to dive into the HTTP spec
but thought if there was a simple, Yes or No answer then I could spend my
evenings doing something other then falling asleep over the HTTP spec. ;-)

Speaking of Holy Cows, you should be very careful with that large .pfd file.
Pfd (short for "pferd," the German word for "horse") files contain the
entire essence of a digitized horse (highly compressed, of course). Deleting
this file could cause your computer to lose some of its horse-power.

On the other hand, it could be a dead horse, in which case there's no great
profit to be made in killing or even beating it.

Just thought you might want to know....

Subject: [PLUG] PXE booter...
Message-ID: <20030308022050.25066.qmail@ns1.robinson-west.com>

To use PXE do I have to purchase it or abandon etherboot entirely?  Can PXE 
run memtest.bin after loading it off the tftp-server the way it would 
normally work if it were written out to a normal floppy?  I haven't been able 
to figure out what I've been told about getting memtest86 to work directly
out of etherboot.  Fact is, I've tried setting image to the binary itself, 
tried mknbi-linux on memtest.bin, tried tagging memtest.bin, tried compiling
rocklinux source code and tagging that memtest86 3.0 image, and none
of this works.  I get an error from etherboot that it is an invalid image 
regardless whether I copy memtest.bin to my tftp server or attempt to
tag either memtest.bin or memtest.img.  There are instructions in many
places about booting memtest via liloand something about syslinux and
memtest which I don't quite follow.  I guess memtest.bin is a program that
is normally fed directly to the beginning of memory from a local source.
I guess I need to netboot an environment that will load memtest.bin and
then place it in the same place it would end up if it were loaded off of 
floppy.  Not to mention, some switch probably needs to be set to cause
the binary to execute once it loads.

Thanks for the tip.

I was actually a little off on the size.  It was only 4M rather than
4G.  Whoops!

The /tmp is empty of all unnecessary files (all but fonts). 

I still can't figure out what is taking so much space.  It appears that
RH8 complete install is a 10G program.  That can't be the case....can
it?  It is the only thing on this machine.

I know, I know.  Living on the edge.  I suppose if I had anything on
this computer I didn't want to lose then I would be a lot more careful. 
Right now I am just cramming in as much dinking around as I can to
figure this puppy out.

Primarily what I wanted to do was delete some old user accounts I
created and no longer need.  Since there were so many layers of dir to
go through, I simply wanted to rm -r the whole damn thing.....but then
it had to ask me if I was sure for every single file.  How fast can you
hit y <enter>, y <enter>, y<enter>.... :)

I have an answer for that Rich. Right now there is no mandate that the
State allow Open Source vendors consideration RFP and contract award
process. This bill mandates that Open Source be treated with the same
consideration as Microsoft and all of the other software vendors. This
is actually a very good thing since it seems to be difficult to convince
some State business units that moving to Linux is not as bad as they
think it might be.

Sean,

Use this command to figure out what is taking the most space in reverse
order by size:

  find / -exec du -h {} \; 2>/dev/null | sort -rn | less

This will take awhile. Substitute '/' with the directory that you wish
to search, '/var' for example.

Okay, I have PHP4.3.1 installed, and working well. Now, I need to get IMAP
support.. The PHP configure tag for this is '--with-imap' but it's not
working, because IMAP isn't installed.

Is there a simple way to install IMAP? I followed the guides on PHP.net
(http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.imap.php), but couldn't get the WU IMAP to
install right... If some one can get back to me ASAP, that would be great.

Thanks,
Roman

You can use the --ignorearch option for rpm.  I ran up against this when
I loaded my first P4 system.  The CPU was so new that the kernel did not
know how to read its label.  I got a i?86 as the architecture in uname.

RedHat would install fine, but try to update an application using RPM
and it would fail with the above error.

In most cases cyclic toner deposits on the page are caused by a failing
photoelectric drum (toner cartridge gone south). For the most part, not
always though, a dirty engine caused vertical streaking on the page.

I'm not completely sure what you're saying, but you don't need to
'purchase' PXE at all. There are lots of RPMs out there:

  http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=pxe

And it looks as if the tftpd-hpa package is what you want in 
Debian-land...

I've got this happening on the left side of the page when I print on my 
HP 4P printers. I decided to save quite a bit of money and bought a 
toner cartridge from one of those websites that sells inkjet and toner 
cartridges. In the beginning the no name cartridge worked fine but now 
it's not so good with the slop along the page edge. 

At this point the print is still readable and I'm only printing drafts 
and stuff so I'm going to keep using the existing cartridge until the 
toner is gone. I'll be going back and paying more for a HP branded 
cartridge next time as I've never had this happen with an HP 
cartridges.

No, it's only about 4.6G.

Tony,

  I've been buying toner cartridges from a local refiller for the past 10
years. First for my HP LaserJet 4L and now for the LJ5. This is the first
time I've had a problem.

  But, since they delivered a new toner cartridge last week, I'll put that
in and see if the problem goes away.

Thanks for the idea!

Speaking from experience, I don't *fully* agree with this anymore Carla.
Although this theory works, the use of stronger passwords will, in the
case of most users, promote system unavailability which results in
post-it notes under the keyboard (which usually happens after calling me
3 times for password changes). About the time that more than 4 users in
a group of 20 have this happen the word gets around to the rest of that
department that the system is unreliable (it forgets my password every
few days and it'll forget yours too). Surprisingly enough, this is
likely to be a great excuse for not meeting deadlines in the eyes of a
junior/middle manager that slips a deadline or two as a result of an
obviously incompetent few. Considering that this is absurd and makes
folks like us roar with laughter is no consolation when your bosses
bosses boss wants a detailed report from an outside consultant as to why
the IT systems and administrators are so unreliable that the sales and
marketing groups are missing customer deadlines (remember, Executive
Managers are users too).

Moral of this rant:
Stronger system rules, like the three strikes and your locked out rule,
makes better sense than to force randomly generated and/or excessively
long and cryptic passwords down the throat of the user community. Good
monitoring practices and, as you mention here, abolition of in-the-clear
transmission is also a must. These methods are relatively transparent to
the user masses and will yield excellent results if properly
implemented. Also, it beats the hell out of a statement like:

"Carla the sysadmin's attitude about the user community is *too bad for
the users*"

showing up on that consultants report to the CEO!

Can you tell that I've been abused for something similar to this? It's
been a long time though and I swear that I'm not in the least bit bitter
about it.

I just did this on my server with PHP 4.3.1, FreeBSD.  I followed the
direction on php.net also, putting the files where they said and pointed
to the directory with: --with-imap=/usr/local/imapxxxxx

I also had to make a switch about SSL since my imap compiled with SSL
support.

Here's my full config script if it helps...

'./configure' '--with-apache=../apache_1.3.27' '--with-mysql=/usr/local'
'--enable-memory-limit=yes' '--enable-debug=no'
'--with-imap=/usr/local/imap-2002b'

This seems about what I did. But the problem is that I can't quite get imap 
to install. I don't quite understand where to install it to. Do I run the 
installer from, say, /usr/local/imap-2002b/ or where? Also, how do you get 
the IMAP to compile (make) with SSL? I have the latest Debian Stable 
Package of SSL installed, but it seems when I make IMAP, it doesn't pick 
up on it. Can I specify a file path?

If you have AIM, it would be great :) I'm 'sigma2kx' on it, and will be on for a 
while..

So you have some process in the first server that is sending a full
"Location:" header and 30x status code back to the browser, so the
browser can fetch the URL from a new server?

That's not clear from your description.  What happens if you fetch the
URL directly with your browser?

I really think password policies need to be appropriate to the 
situation.

* When I've worked in small private company, I typically ran John the 
  Ripper or l0phtcrack and *advised* employees that their passwords 
  are easily cracked using freely available tools.

  I worked under the assumption, however, that our network was
  relatively secure and insulated. I told employees that the biggest 
  danger to their account's security was probably other employees 
  running similar tools. I left it up to them to implement any 
  changes, but told them they'd be getting a similar notice every 
  couple months is their passwords were still easily cracked.

* Working in academia, where network users come and go at a dizzying 
  pace -- that's something different. The network is much less 
  insulated, much larger, and much more difficult to monitor.

  In our case, we run John the Ripper once a quarter and notify anyone 
  with an easily cracked password to make it more difficult *now*; 
  we check again in a few days and start disabling accounts (students) 
  or scheduling quick why-this-is-important meetings (faculty and 
  staff).

I just don't think there's a one-size-fits-all rule for password 
managment. Sometimes you can be loose, sometimes not.

Thanks, they were files and I am not sure what I did wrong before but it

In the (very large) company I work for, I have separate passwords for:
UNIX network systems (several different usernames)
UNIX root (several individual machines)
Windows network systems
Corporate intranet
Corporate VPN
SAP systems
Corporate external ftp
External web sites at affiliated companies

Many of these passwords force a change every 3 months, and you can't
repeat the last 5, etc.  Most people I know are forced to write down their
current passwords because they can't remember them all.  It's that or call
systems for a new password every three weeks.

I have had good luck with the Orinoco wireless cards (originally sold by Lucent now 
through some long line of descent from a company called Proxim)
http://www.proxim.com/products/all/orinoco/client/index.html
These cards are well supported under linux and have good range and reliability.

Nope.  I haven't been out there in a few days.

There are some additional "issues" which might be clouding things.
One "strange" behavior is that most of the time I am not seeing the
POST messages (even with the onboard video).  There are two settings
in BIOS (basically, "silent" and "quick"), and no matter how I set
those, during boot I just see a blinking cursor for, oh, 10 seconds or
so, then it jumps right the W2K boot.  I don't see the copyright
stuff, BIOS version, RAM, that sort of thing.  It isn't clear why.  I
upgraded BIOS to the latest version.  I've email'd Intel about the
behavior, but still navigating their moronic email support system
(their replies get trapped by SpamAssassin, which has slowed things
down even further).

Second, the monitor has had a strange behavior.  Mostly, it works
perfectly, but occasionally it "winks out" for a few seconds and then
comes back on.  We've never received a satisfactory answer from the
manufacturer (ViewSonic I think).

Maybe related, maybe not.

The other theory is that somehow the power supply has gone bad.  It is
fairly new, a 300W Enlight that we got to replace the old power supply
when we upgraded to the P4 last spring.

This is a great example of how a "strong" password policy actually

  Woof! That's quite a lot of material to keep memorized.

  With the Palm-OS PDAs I've used individual records in the various
databases can be locked. Would passwords be adequately secured if you put
the list of username/password in a locked memo? Then you'd need to remember
only the one password to gain access to the others.

  We use something similar here on our PDAs to keep sensitive information
private. Oh, ... this is not a troll, but a request for information and
learning. I've no idea how secure a Palm OS password really is.

Bill,

  Thanks, that's good to know. Initially, this will be used just in the
house. But, ... well, we all know how that expands.

  What about hubs I could patch-cord to my little 5-port switch?

tcpdump or ethereal are usually good choices.

As 802.11b is very popular right now, unsurprisingly most pc cards have 
driver suppport with a few exceptions. Do your shopping an find the ones 
that strike your fancy for looks, features and whatever else.  Then do a 
google search for those particular cards.  There have been issues with 
Dlink (to name one) where the manufacturer changed the chipset but not the 
model designator rendering the card useless for linux compatibility.

Yes.  What I have found out is that if I put the URL in a browser it works
fine.  I have also found out that that Host: header that Apache writes
does not include the Port number with the first request.  If I ask for
authenication and not pass the cookie that I was Tomcat returns an
authenication prompt, I enter user/pw then Apache adds the Host: header
with the correct Port and Tomcat can retrieve the correct Port.

Headers look like:

with authenication first request

Host: tomcat.server.com


without auhenication but after manually entering auth.

Hot:  tomcat.server.com:8809

I have read up on the Host: header and it is suppose to add the port when
it is not 80.  This seems to be a consistant problem on many HTTP clients
which then makes we wonder.  It is only on the first request that they
fail to send the port number.  Like they want a response before actually
sending the correct information.

I hope that is clearer. Thanks for the help.

Josh

I wouldn't assume very.  I use Keyring on my Palm, which stores the
passwords encrypted with a password--so you really just need to remember
your Keyring password.

  Aha! So that's what keyring is. I see it referenced on the jpilot mail

3DES: http://gnukeyring.sourceforge.net/
AES: http://www.zetetic.net/products.html

But the problem with passwords on a palm is that they're too easy to 
shoulder-surf.

Uh, Apache isn't supposed to be writing a host header.  The result
from Apache should simply be a "Location: http://some.host:1234/url/path".

Then the browser fetches it by initiating a new HTTP request to the
new server.

Before you start to monitor with something like ethereal, which will
generate a large volume of data, you might want to use netstat -tus to
get a handle on the ratio of incoming to outgoing segments and
datagrams. With the info from netstat you can make a rational decision
as to what to focus on with a monitoring tool.

Great command.  Thanks

I noticed I have 2 of everything.  That would explain why 11G are taken

I think I am going to do a fresh install and begin again.

Look in your /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 and make sure ZAxisMapping enabled.

Option          "ZAxisMapping"          "4 5"

So the browser writes the Host: header?  Hmm.  Ok.  I'll test a few
browsers out.  Thanks.

No, it would mean the command isn't working correctly :)  You cannot
have two of everything (I assume you mean you have two of every file

I also have a Logitech Wheel Mouse USB, but using an
adapter to make it PS/2  so it works through my KVM.
In Red Hat 8.0, it works perfectly if I describe it as
a Generic Wheel Mouse PS/2 in mouseconfig.

It is counting the directories twice. I do not know why. This solves the
problem:

  find / -type f -exec du -h {} \; 2>/dev/null | sort -rn | less

Does anyone know why this is happening?

Because 'du -h /path' summarizes the subdirectories and the and
directories its called on. so for each subdirectory of /foo, you get
/foo counted.  If you want it to work right, use 'du -sh'.

  I have a portable running Libranet/debian and I need to change a user
account so login goes to the console rathern than gdm. I've completely
blanked on where the individual-user-run-level is set. It's not
/etc/inittab.

  In Red Hat run level 3 is multi-user with network support at the console
while run level 5 is multi-user with network support in X. In debian and
slackware, run level 2 is multi-user with network support, but I don't know
how to specify console or X, nor in which file.

Thanks,

  I want to install Slackware-8.1 on my Toshiba Portege 3025CT. The floppy
disk is a direct plug-in and the cdrom drive is connected via a pcmcia card.
The drive's recognized after the system boots (with Red Hat 6.2 and the
2.2.19 kernel). I'm trying to learn what I need to replace RH with Slack.

  According to the Slackware.txt file on the distribution cdrom (#1), there
are supposed to be two directories: bootdisks/ and rootdisks/. However,
they're not there.

  If I read and understood the text file correctly, I need three floppy
disks: a boot disk (bare.i), a root disk, and the pcmcia.img disk. Since the
cdrom doesn't have the two directories it's supposed to, I'm wondering if I
need to search the disk for the specific files then dd them to floppies.

  I checked the Slackware Web site, but there's no general user mail list,
only announce and security-announce. Other than one person in Ohio who I
know runs Slackware, I don't know where to get educated. Some of you do run
this distribution so I hope that you can help me over this first hurdle.

Thanks,

Rich

It's been 4 or 5 years since I used Slackware, so I can't be very helpful.
But the files you seek appear to be on the Slackware FTP site:

ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-8.1/bootdisks/bare.i
ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-8.1/isolinux/pcmcia.dsk
(?)
ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-8.1/rootdisks/pcmcia.dsk

Not sure which ones you need, but all the documentation appears to be
there as well.

  Thanks, David. I didn't find them on the Web site and checking the ftp
server hadn't occurred to me.

Hey, David!

  There's a file, pcmcia.dsk.README, on the ftp site that's not on any of
the cdroms I was sent. This README file lists the specific steps and floppy
images needed to install Slackware on my notebook.

  Now I can proceed with confidence.

If you ordered the official disk set, they may be on one of the other
CDs... they were taken off the first CD to make it small enough to fit
on a CD-R.  One-CD installs is what Pat was going for.

Grab them from your favorite mirror (leave ftp.slackware.com for the
mirrors to sync against).  I really like ftp.kpn.be, it is one fast
mirror and I know the admin.  :-)

Infortunately... the root disk is now something like six disks long in
Slackware 8.1.  The kernel can load one compressed initrd disk or
multiple non-compressed disks... so when Pat's root disk went over a
compressed 1.whatever megabyte disk size, he had to run it uncompressed.

He overcame the problem with 9.0 with the idea (I think) of putting just
the bare minimum on the initrd and then copying files from a second disk
after it loaded.  As boot/root disks are backwards-compatable (but *not*
forwards-compatable) you can use the boot/root/pcmcia from
slackware-current to install off the Slackware-8.1 CD.

A friend and I came up with the idea of a one-CD boot for those with
ATAPI CD-ROM drives but a BIOS unable to boot the new 8.1 CD (which
booted differently than 8.0 and earlier did - it didn't emulate a floppy
like they did)... we created a FreeDOS bootdisk with loadlin that loaded
an image off the CD-ROM drive.  It worked well, but I don't think would
work for your PCMCIA CD-ROM drive without a little hacking (to add
drivers for the PCMCIA controller).

If you search groups.google.com for alt.os.linux.slackware, you should
find answers to most of your questions.  Otherwise, there are at least a
few Slackware users here on the PLUG list, and I think a few more over
on the PDXLUG list.  There are also a few general user lists out there,
I think.  There are also forums at www.userlocal.com (web-based) along
with links to a lot of other stuff.  Then there are a lot of packages
available at www.linuxpackages.net if you decide to go the precompiled
package route for things (which I don't suggest - just get the source).

Have fun, happy Slacking.  :-)

Rob

You may have already figured this out from the sound of it, but as of 8.1 the
rootdisk is too big for a single floppy, so instead of color.gz you have to
make disks with install.1, ..., install.5.  So you'll need bare.i, pcmcia.dsk,
and the five install.* disks.  If you want you can use network.dsk and install
over the network if you have trouble with the pcmcia cdrom.

BTW, if you want to get bleeding edge and use slackware-current, there is a
handy perl script called slackupdate that updates currently installed packages
with packages in the current directory.  I'm keeping a private mirror of
slackware-current and have used that perl script as the basis for an "up2date"
script.  You can probably google for slackupdate, or let me know if you can't
find it and I'll email it to you.

Rob,

  Yes, I ordered the subscription. But, the images are _not_ on any of the 4
cdroms. There is, for example, a bare.i/ directory on the first disk, but
that has the three files on it, not an image file I can dd to the floppy
disk. There are no install.N on the set. Gotta' get those from the ftp
mirror site.

  Kinda' makes me wonder why I bought the disks if I have to get the actual
files from the 'Net to install on a notebook. Oh, well.

You really want to make sure that the card has Prism chipset in the
wireless card.

Check netgate for some really fantastic 200mW cards that will give you
the most range and sensitivity for the buck.
http://netgate.com/

The best linux support will be for the prism 2/2.5/3 chipsets and you
also have the ability to use them in AP mode to create a linux based AP.
Orinoco cards have great client support under Linux and are reliable
cards there is no AP mode support for these cards in Linux only AD-HOC
and Managed.

As far as off the shelf APs go the Linksys aren't that bad at all. 

Watch out for the new DLink and Linksys client cards as many
manufacturers have moved to a chipset from Broadcom and those don't have
support under Linux.

Check here for another list of Prism based cards:
http://www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/Prism2Card

The Netgate cards are great.

/etc/init.d/ contains the startup scripts, /etc/rc?.d/ contain links to
the startup scripts.  Any link that starts with an "S" runs the script
with a "start" parameter, any link that starts with a K, runs the script
with a "stop" parameter.

Essentially, Debian uses only through run-level 2, the additional
run-levels are there, but they start off as just duplicates of rc2.d. 
These additional run levels can be modified, then utilized, but I'm not
sure that will do the job you in the way you want.

Do you want just one user to not get the GUI login?  Or, do you want all
users to not get the GUI login?

If the first is true, then you will probably be better off controlling
the .xsession and .bashrc of your users, have gdm off globally, but
starts up for those that you want.

If the latter is true, then just uninstall gdm, problem solved.

Good Luck

  I've had the occasional floppy disk not want to work with linux, but today
has set a record. I need 7 floppies to boot my notebook so I can install
Slackware. Using "dd if=<filename> of=/dev/fd0", I successfully made 3 of
the 7 floppies. The last 9 attempts _looked_ like they were working, but I
cannot mount the floppy drive to look at the disks:

[rshepard at salmo /usr1/slackware-8.1]$ dd if=install.5 of=/dev/fd0
2880+0 records in
2880+0 records out
[rshepard at salmo /usr1/slackware-8.1]$ mount /mnt/floppy
mount: I could not determine the filesystem type, and none was specified

  Has anyone else run into such a string of bad copies on Imation (nee 3M)
floppy disks? I need to go buy more in the hopes of getting this done today.

Paul,

  Many thanks!

  I've learned that I don't want a WAP because the network switch here is

The PCMCIA Card Services project (that provides the drivers for PC Cards
under Linux) has a list of supported cards at their site:

<http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/ftp/SUPPORTED.CARDS>

Towards the bottom there's a list of supported wireless network

Sounds like there is no formatting on the floppies or they are some 
_really_ strange format.  As you may know floppies typically get a 
low-level format plus a system level.   Could be you have really raw 
bunch of floppies, ie. never used before.  Try 

	fdformat /dev/fd0H1440

first then use the dd command.

  I've gone through 16 floppy disks without successfully copying/converting
a file using 'dd'. I've tried on two different machines and both with and
without specifying ibs/obs of 1024 bytes.

  Could there be that many bad Imation disks in one box (and 1 from a brand
new box I just bought)? I cannot recall ever having this much difficulty
copying boot images from a hard disk/cdrom to a floppy disk. I'd like to
know if there's something I might be doing to cause these failures or if
there's another approach I can try.

  I've used "fdformat /dev/fd0H1440" on some of these, but that makes no
difference. Is there either a tool that will tell me just what's going on
with the disk or a tool that will let me get these last 4 images onto floppy
disks?

It's not been a fun day here,

Rod,

  The disks are pre-formatted (vfat, of course). In any case, dd is a
byte-by-byte copying tool so it doesn't matter whether or not the disk is
formatted. I tried on two different systems (two different floppy drives,
two different copies of dd).

  Regardless, in desparation, I tried formatting the disks first and then
running 'dd'. Makes no difference.

  The md5 sums of install.? match the values in the file, CHECKSUMS.md5,
from the slackware ftp server.

  I've had a few disks per box be bad, but not 17 in a row from two
different boxes.

Yep.  It still doesn't work

I changed to Profile 'PS/2' and that didn't do anything either

I have also found that the mouse pad and button mouse on the keyboard
(HP Omnibook laptop) do not work either.  They did at installation, but
I apparently changed something along the lines to disable them.

How does your entire Input Device section read?

Look in your /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 and make sure ZAxisMapping enabled.

The alias referring to rm is in the root dir

I understand -i is a verify command.  I am going to live on the edge and

As root, check out the following files:

  /etc/bashrc
  /root/.bashrc

Less likely you are using the Korne shell:

  /etc/kshrc
  /root/.kshrc

You should see something like:

  alias rm -rf='rm -rif'

Remove this alias and (possibly) re-login.

DISCLAIMER: Doing this may someday cause you grief. The Linux 'rm'
command, just like about everything else in Linux, will do _exactly_
what you tell it too. No "are you sure" dialog boxes, no "you are about
to do something silly" messages, just the absolute command.

'rm' will absolutely trash your system without even the common courtesy
of a ..err, you get the picture.

So if you're feeling manly--if you think you got what it takes, you just
remove those 'wimpy' lines from your *rc files, the sky's the limit!

  Thanks to Rob and Ed I learned a lesson: the file copied to the disk with
'dd' is not mountable. However, when I calculate the md5sum on /dev/fd0, it
matches the checksum of the install.? file on the hard drive.

  In the six years now that I've been running Red Hat I never encountered
this situation so I had no experience in unmountable floppy disks.

  Public thanks to both of 'em!

My ps/2 microsoft intellimouse is happy with
(/etc/X11/XF86Config-4)

Section "InputDevice"
         Identifier  "Mouse0"
         Driver      "mouse"
         Option      "Device" "/dev/mouse"
         Option      "Protocol" "imps/2"
         Option      "Emulate3Buttons" "off"
         Option      "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
EndSection

Don't know if case makes a difference.  Is yours a ps/2 or usb?  Have never 
configured a usb mouse.

Subject: [PLUG] IMAP for home use?
Message-ID: <3E6C1CC6.3050104@pacifier.com>

I'm currently the only user receiving mail on my home lan and I'd like to be 
able send/receive (and access central addressbook) from two client machines 
while maintaining one mailbox directory.

Always thought imap was the correct way, but this HOWTO,
<http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Cyrus-IMAP.html> recommends against going through 
the trouble for such a small network in favor of POP.

Q1: True?  (POP vs IMAP)
Q2: How does one tell which version of imap is installed?  Neither the RH
     site, nor the man page, nor the docs indicate Cyrus, Washington,
     Courier...
Q3: When is Ed's book to be published?


Details:
	Mail handled by my isp over dsl via pop3 which is queried every 10 minutes 
by Mozilla's email client.

Kyle,

  I guess that I don't understand. Here, we have /home and /var/spool/mail
exported from the server and nfs mounted on the other workstation (or the
portables when desired). Regardless of which machine is in front of us, we
log in to our one /home directory and mail is there in the same place. I
wasn't aware this was a mail problem. It worked this way for several years
before we dropped dial up for ADSL. Ran fetchmail as a daemon (checking for
mail every 2 minutes via pop3) for almost two years until I set up postfix
here and had the primary MX point here.

But but but the Slackware site says to do this:

http://slackware.com/install/bootdisk.php
"Once you have selected a boot disk image file from the list below, you will 
need to create the disk. If you are creating the image from a Linux system, 
the following command should work just fine:

dd if=[image file name] of=/dev/fd0"

You could be less crazy and use /bin/rm when you really don't want
the -i and leave the alias for those fuzzy sleepy periods where you
may try to rm your whole filesystem.

Right. However, it doesn't mean that the resulting floppy
is in a format that can be mounted.

...or preceed the command with a "\" to bypass the alias:

$ \rm <files...>

(does this work in shells other than bash?)

This isn't true.  When I copy images of 1680k formatted disks, I have to
format the disk (with "superformat /dev/fd0 sect=21 cyl=80") to the
larger size before dd will successfully copy.  So the formatting of a
floppy does add information to the disk that dd doesn't (or can't) copy.

Just thought I'd set the record straight.

Thanks, that's another possibility, I meant to ask for any solutions.  I 
guess you've had better luck with nfs than me.  My experience is that if a 
client disconnects ungracefully (dead laptop batt), the server becomes 
unresponsive.  It's been a while, but if I remember, the nfs daemon (mountd 
or rpc?) had the ability to completely destabilize the server.  Hopefully 
this has changed.

I'll give it a shot, it's the easiest to set up.

Or use ssh and, regardless of which machine is in front of you, login

Another route to go is by using "ethernet converters" which are basically

Dlink's DWL-810+ is one example.

I think you're completely sane.  I think people who set up aliases
overloading system commands are nuts.

The problem is, if *you* do that on one box, and then you type on a
different box, that same flag isn't there.  Ooops!

Go ahead and alias:

        aliase del = 'rm -i'

and learn to type "del".  The worst that will happen is that you get
to another box, and the "del" alias isn't there!

  I have failed to communicate clearly. The 'dd' command ran to completion.
However, being the paranoid that I am, I like to confirm that anything
written to a floppy disk was done properly. Therefore, when the 'dd' command
returned, I tried to mount the floppy so I could list the contents. That's
why I was getting the messages about the filesystem type not being specified
or discernable to the system.

  However, using Rob's suggestion of comparing md5sums between the floppy
contents and the checksums provided on the Slackware site I was able to
verify both that the 'dd' command worked properly and just which file was on
the diskette.

  Bill's right on. I never had an alias until my fingers went faster than my
brain one morning and I wiped out all the dot-files in my home directory. Do
you have any idea how many dot-files you have, and what they are?
Fortunately, I had a very recent backup so I restored them all. Since then I
use the alias with the '-i' and I don't worry about the flying fickle
fingers of fate.

  Can't comment. When I turn on the notebook it becomes part of the network
and the filesystems exported by the other boxes are visible. When I shut
down the notebook nothing on the big boxes change. I don't deliberately
mount and umount remote filesystems.

  However, I don't automatically mount an nfs-exported filesystem on the
notebook when it's on the network. I use the connetion only to transfer
files between it and the main workstation. Perhaps the way I use the network
just did not expose me to the problems you encountered.

The rootdisks (five of them, IIRC) all together make up one filesystem. 
I'd test them with md5sum, not trying to mount them (if you don't want
to use the slackware-current rootdisks, instead, anyway)... or cat them
all together into one big file and try and mount that, loopback.

Since the disks together make up a single filesystem, you can't mount
them individually.

My Postfix header_checks is blocking a friend trying to send me an email
because it is failing the helo filter.  It is failing because he is NATing
his home LAN, and his mail server presents itself with a FQDN which
doesn't resolve to a public IP address.
Is there an easy way to make a Postfix whitelist which says "accept mail
from so-and-so regardless of the other filters"?  I can simply turn off
the helo checks, but they seem to be useful in stopping at least some
spam.

Thanks!

Yes, of course. Just create a map file with the IP address(es)
of the remote mail server(s) you always want to receive mail
from and refer to it in your smtpd_recipient_restrictions
sections before the maps that block the mail.
For example:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
      check_client_access = hash:/etc/postfix/goodip,
      ...,
      [your black lists]
      ...,
      permit mynetworks

In the goodip file:

1.2.3.4   OK


Don't forget to use the postmap program

Russell,

This is my work email address, and I don't have easy access (nor the
desire to have access to work-type stuff) over the weekend or outside
of business hours.  So you may conclude the following:

I wasn't here to read your email or write a Perl solution


There may not be an easier Perl solution, I'm guessing that the code
would be longer than a 1-liner due to dealing with 2 files, but that
particular problem (file1 has patterns to match on file2) is a classic
perl one, I believe it's in the FAQ and in the Perl Cookbook, as well
as other places.

I can't say that I've had that problem, and I'm serving nfs to 150 *nix 
machines. However, I'm doing so via autofs, not static mounts. autofs 
allows the system to mount the directory when needed, and then it 
automatically unmounts if it's not used for a period of time.

There IS one problem with nfs in linux as opposed to other Unixes, that I'm 
aware of. And it does involve ungraceful umounting. However, it's when the 
server goes away while the client is connected. The client maintains the 
mount information, and when the server comes back, it doesn't know about 
it. The client will then report a "Stale mount", and the server ignores 
requests for that export, from that client. I know Solaris handles this 
gracefully, and will allow the client to reconnect. Forcing a umount on the 
client of the affected mount will usually resolve this issue.

Not necessarily. 

There is a little program called TealLock too. This program obfuscates
the on-screen passwords while you put them in by making them little
stars (*). You can also use a 'keypad combination'. That is a feature
that allows you to use the application buttons and scroll buttons on
your palm as a sortof combo lock. Also, TealLock has a feature that
allows you to set an arbitrary number of failed logins after which your
entire palm is erased. It also has encryption, and a lot of other things
that make life easier.

There is now a release of PGP 8.0 for PalmOS as well, giving PGPDisk
support (among other things) which is fairly secure.

I think the combination of these two things would make a palm fairly
well secured. Links provided below.

In my experience, that's only partially true. If the server goes away
and then comes back while the client had no open files, then all is
well. The staleness gets reported only when open files are involved.

Mostly true, unless the NFS connection is using tcp instead of udp 
(which is far more common on Solaris systems than Linux hosts). tcp 
connctions, being stateful, require a forced umount/mount.

If you're still in student mode this may be of interest.

In the term starting March 31 PCC is offering CIS279L  Network Admin I:Linux

I'm the instructor, this may indicated that pigs are flying and hell is freezing.

This is a first level course that covers TCP/IP fundamentals, essential services,
setup and troubleshooting.  Linux is the example OS that will be used for class
labs and demonstrations.

The primary text is TCP/IP Network Administration 3rd Edition (O'Reilly crab book), 
the secondary text is the online version of the NAG.

  Well, I knew it was too easy. :-) The installation on my Toshiba was
plodding along just fine until I got to the networking setup. When the
system asked me if I wanted it to probe for the NIC, I put in the pcmcia NIC
and responded, "yes". The result was a kernel panic and an inability to fix
anything 'cause I don't yet have a root password and I selected reiserfs for
the filesystems when I ran fdisk.

  Since I need to go through the exercise again, what suggestions have you
to avoid this problem? I will keep the NIC in the second pcmcia slot (the
cdrom drive occupies the other one). Could it be a gateway problem? I've not
had my kernels panic before, they've always been calm and well adjusted to
life in the system.

TIA,

If you read the text before you type 'setup', you will see instructions to
load the pcmcia drivers before you start setup.  This will help the setup
find the NIC when you do the network setup. :-)  Pop your card in and type
the commands to load PCMCIA, then start setup.

Oh, I know there _is_ a perl solution, I used to write them.  The
technique I used to use was to read file1 into a hash table and then
loop through file2 comparing the appropriate fields in each line
against presence in the hash table.  This solution lacked

Funny, when people quote me in an email and reply to what I wrote, I
assume they're writing to me.  Kind of like now.  In an open forum with
lots of people, you and I are having a conversation with one another.

Onelinedness is very handy.  That's one of the other reasons that
I use perl. :)  I haven't found corresponding ways to do things like

##Equivalent of cut and paste
perl -lane

##Inplace editing
perl -pi -e

##File slurp, reduced I/O
perl -0777 -ne

easily in tcsh/bash yet, but I don't know either of them very well,
either.

I think if this was something that I was going to do lots of, I'd
"precompile" the database file into a perl data structure, then require
it into a second script that just does key lookups.  It should be
faster, especially since the precompilation can be done only when the
database changes.  It would save the iterating through hash keys.

I think all the probing for hardware does is it attempts to load a
module, then if that fails it moves on to the next, and so on.  Toss
PCMCIA into that mix and many times you run in to problems like kernel
oop's.

I'd just load the proper module for your network card manually and go
that route...

Matt,

  Not applicable. This was after all applications were installed (based on
my choices). I am _not_ installing across the network, but I do want the
machine to be part of the network.

  I had already entered a host name, a domain, a static IP address, the
netmask and the gateway. This comes _long_ after running setup.

Rob,

  That's what I was thinking. This next time I'll let it go without probing
and load the 3com module when it's all done.

Thanks,

A few years ago, Slackware lost its publisher (which also published a
BSD, and decided they didn't want Slackware and a BSD, as Slackware is
so BSD-like).... and when that happened, Pat took over and has pretty
much been running slackware by himself ever since.

He doesn't like documentation or website maintenance, as far as I can
tell... a group of regular posters from alt.os.linux.slackware have
started a 'Slackbook Renewal Project' to fix The Good Book so it is up
to date in regards to Slackware 8.0 and up.  The book was written for
7.1.  When that is done, the documentation on slackware.com will be more
up to date... but until then, look elsewhere for slackware specific
stuff (pretty  much just the install and special bootscripts) and look
at generic linux for the rest of it.

This is something that I do lots of on random different files.
Pre-cooking doesn't feel ad hoc enough for me.

I kind of like the awk solution I gave earlier.  It has a
code-that-writes-code Lisp macro feel to it.  But the egrep -f
solution is more compact for the simple case.

I'm trying to figure out if there is outgoing traffic from my machine that

#tcpdump -i ppp0

And I'm getting:

So it looks like something is being sent over my ppp0 connection (from
port 42308?) to 213.92.8.4.  Is this the correct interpretation?
Does it have anything to do with irc? (the '213.92.8.4.ircd' makes me
suspect this, but I'm not running irc on this machine)  And how can I
tell what is bound to port 42308 if my interpretation is correct? (netstat
doesn't show anything there).

Some process on your machine is talking to the irc daemon at 213.92.8.4 aka calvino.freenode.net.  So, yes, you are right about that.  The irc server is on the other machine and whether you know it or not, you had an active irc client going when you did the tcpdump.

netstat should show the connection.  Did you `netstat -nt` ?

Hello Linux folkz,
Just this morning my five year old trustful 
organizer SHARP WIZARD OZ-570 suddently died.
Memory chipset failure. :(
Could somebody please recommend any good pocket 
size organizer with the keyboard and possibility
to natively synchronize it with Linux.
B&W or color screen doesn't matter much, as soon
as I can use its keyboard to select items and enter
the data. I don't like these modern PDA's which use
a stick only to operate with them. 
I prefer a keyboard.

Many thanks in advance.

Alex

If you are looking for a Palm compatible, take a look at palm.com. The 
Tungston has a keyboard, although I've never used one.

Also, some of the more expensive Sony CLIE models have keyboards.

At the same time, they will accept input via the graffiti alphabet.

For what it's worth, it only took me a couple of weeks to learn graffiti to 
a point at which it is usable. Most of the strokes are really intuitive.

If it is truly dead and out of warranty, there's no harm in opening it
up.  I'd try re-seating every connector I could find.  Perhaps the
memory is socketed.  Of course I have no idea how difficult it would
be to take apart, not having seen one.

Just a followup, my sed command is broken (doesn't strip trailing
white space).  This one seems to work better and is a little more
compact:

  $ sed -e 's/^/^/' -e 's/ *$/($| )/' file1 | egrep -f - file2

The first -e clause is a little confusing at first glance, appearing
to replace a caret with a caret.  However, the caret in the pattern
matches the start of line, while the caret in the replacement is a
literal.  

The second -e clause replaces trailing white space with the optional
pattern for egrep.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux Video Project Idea...
Message-ID: <1047336176.9969.181.camel@duron.stpaultel.com>

I'm looking for a way to record some TV shows at specified times
automatically, and then compress them... so I don't need to be within a
thousand miles of a computer or TV and won't miss some of my favorite
shows.  The idea is, I can have somebody local then burn the episodes to
CD, and mail me the CD... then I can watch the episode the next time I
see my laptop.

Has anybody here ever looked much in to V4L recorders and the like?  I
have two weeks to get this up and going, if I can, and have only begun
looking at what it will take.  I'm totally lost.

I was thinking it would be as simple as buying a TV card, install V4L
drivers, getting some easily found and easily the answer program to
record the video and change channels, etc, which is bash scriptable and
doesn't require X to be running... then compress them with some other
easily found and easily the answer program to compress the files the
recorder recorded.  Then I just script together something with cron and
am good to go.

But it is looking more complicated now.  :-(

It seems there are a plethora of things that can record from V4L... but
can they do things like change the channel?  I do not know.  It seems
there are a plethora of encoders, too.  Is one far superior to the
other?

So, if any of you guys have ever looked in to undertaking such a
thing... or even just use V4L to record things manually from time to
time, I'd appreciate your input.  I'm just looking for something simple
I can script together with bash... I don't need a TiVo or VCR+
replacement.  :-)

Thanks!

Well, technically, I said: "Bonus points for avoiding Perl", which
isn't _exactly_ the same thing.

Honestly, I am always interested in learning something new.  One of
the reasons I wanted to "avoid Perl" was because I've done it in Perl
before and (at least the way I did it) it just felt a little too heavy
for my purposes.  One liners are nice because they can be easily
retrieved from shell history and mutated to fit new circumstances.

Lots of rootkits & other bits of nasty software will open (without your
knowlege) a connection to an IRC server in order to receive their
instructions, such as which victim to start DOSing, where to email your
credit card/social security/bank account numbers, and so on.

So unless you knowingly had an IRC client running, assume that your
machine has been compromised.

  If it's inappropriate to carry this thread on the mail lists, please
respond to me privately.

  Now that I have Slackware-8.1 installed I learned that when I add a user
(for example, me), no home directory is set up, no .bash_profile or .bashrc
is created, and so on. In other words, no skeleton for a user as is the case
with Red Hat. So I'm doing it all by hand.

  But, I'm missing something here. I wrote (based on my files on the
desktop), .bash_profile, .bashrc and .keymap. In .bashrc I have defined
colors for the prompt, but they're not visible when I log in until I type,
"source .bashrc". Why? Isn't .bashrc read automatically? It should be, if I
read the beginning of .bash_profile properly.

  I'm now wondering what else I have to add manually to get going. Haven't
tried the network or starting X yet.

Puzzled,

Rich

Have you tried the adduser manpage?  I'm willing to bet if that's how
you add users, that if you populate /etc/skel/ (or the Slackware
equivalent) with the proper files that it will install them for you.

Good luck,

Colin,

  Yup, there's a /etc/skel/ but it's pretty much empty. Only a .screenrc and
I'm not really sure just what that does right now. I also didn't use the -m
and -k switches. Still wouldn't have had the .bash_profile and .bashrc
there. Guess I need to get them on there when I get networking going.

Thanks again,

Message-ID: <6829.12.47.207.4.1047346650.squirrel@webmail.pdxlug.org>

I would like to have Apache redirect URLs for me.  For example, when a
user goes to http://server1.domain.tld, I want them redirected to
http://server2.domain.tld.  Currently I'm accomplishing this with HTTP
redirects in a bunch of HTML files, but I think it'd be cleaner and easier
to manage if I could have one line per domain in my httpd.conf.

Any suggestions?
Thanks,

Are you running adduser or useradd?  adduser will create the home
directories for ya.  I think it's the best way of adding users, myself,
so I copied it over to a RH box when I had to add some twenty odd users
to it the other day.  :-)

I think this might be in the AOLS FAQ -
http://wombat.san-francisco.ca.us/faqomatic/cache/1.html

If not... it has to do with the way bash works.  It's either a login
prompt or something else... the details are going foggy on me.  You need
to call it with a different argument to get it right, or switch around
.bash_profile or .bashrc... I really don't have all the details, but can
get them for you if you get stuck.

X will probably work without any messing with the config file, via the
VESA framebuffer.  But you want to configure it yourself to use your
video card/chip for the acceleration.  You can grab 3.3.6 packages if
you need to downgrade XFree.

If you didn't set up the network yet, run netconfig or just manually
edit /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 (most of the variables are at the top, I think).

I didn't know of these things.  :-)

Did you try putting a .bashrc, .bash_profile, etc, etc, etc in there and
see if it gets added?

.screenrc is a config file for Screen, the 'window manager' that doesn't
require X.  :-)

Are you sure this will work?

http://www.postfix.com/uce.html

        At present, specifying a header pattern with OK serves no useful
        purpose. A rule ending in OK affects only the header being
        matched. The next header may still result in a REJECT match,
        causing the mail still to be rejected.

Matt,

You may find the ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse to be the easiest for
whole domain redirects.

Syntax is:

ProxyPass / http://server2.domain.tld/
ProxyPassReverse / http://server2.domain.tld/

This would redirect anything from the first domain to the other.  The
reverse will allow anything coming back from the 2nd to go back out from
apache.  I use this with much success.  You can even use this for things
like redirecting a particular sub directory to a completely differnet host
or port.

Another example would be:

ProxyPass /mydir http://server2.domain.tld:8888/otherdir
ProxyPassReverse /mydir http://server2.domain.tld:8888/otherdir


These would go in your virtual directives.  That is assuming you have
virtual directives. Or at the root otherwise.

Josh

left something off.  This does use the proxy mod and you may need to
activate it.  But it is easier then writing a mod rewrite script.  Unless
you really have some need for regular expressions I wouldn't bother with
it.

Thank you everyone, I have enough now. There is inconsistency in where the

consistent.

Thanks much!

It's the same on RH 7.2, although I'm running a 2.4.18 kernel.

Ah - this grabs from V4L.  :-)

But it is written against the avifile in CVS on November 11th... 2001. 
Did ya have any problems with that or should I go somewhere else?

Those look very similar, and way super cool if I wanted a TiVo

Yeah, I think it's been established the MPlayer devs are a bit different
than your typical guys.

I think this settles it - I'm going to have to get a TV card and work on
this for real.  :-)

Now... I saw some darned cheap... like less than $50 cheap... TV cards
at Fry's the other day.. I suppose I can talk one of the Fry Guys to
open one up so I can see the chip it uses.  :-)

Oh, another concern of mine is I'm using a Duron 650... will it be
capable of encoding ~8 hours of TV a week, do ya think?  It's on an
nForce board with lotsa memory bandwidth, so does ok for itself... but I
can probably spring for a new CPU, too, if it's needed.  That would push
me way over budget... but 'eh.. oh well.

mencoder can use the v4l driver to select a channel as an argument.

Here's the command I stole from freevo; salt to taste:

/usr/bin/mencoder -tv \
on:driver=v4l:input=0:norm=NTSC:channel=58:chanlist=us-cable:width=320:height=240:outfmt=yv12:adevice=/dev/audio:audiorate=32000:forceaudio:forcechan=1:buffersize=64

I'm pretty new at this, but the one hour long show I recorded stayed
synced thru the whole thing. That public broadcasting's Nova uses
voiceovers heavily made it rather hard to check that. :-)

ALSA 0.9.0_rc6.

Haven't messed with this in a while. Once I got mencoder playing nice,
I haven't look back. My avifile is much newer (0.7.32.20030219), but
again, I haven't tried it for a few months.

Anything w/ a Bt8*8 and you'll be fine. I got a WinTV-Go w/ the Bt848
and it's, uh, Go'ing. Zero extra features, mono sound, but it was
cheap. The external loopback cable for the sound is chintzy, but how
much can you ask for in a $50 tuner card?

The Duron should be fine. My 800MHz Athlon uses 30-40% CPU time
encoding using the above command.

Sorry for the late chime-in, it's /boot/grub on RH8 2.4.19-26 too but
this is an ln -s -> /boot/grub.conf.

Wil,

  I cannot address using IP addresses, but putting the domain name with an
"OK" works just fine here. I had a couple of folks who's mail bounced for no
reason we could discover. I put their domain names in /etc/postfix/badaddr
and /etc/postfix/header_checks, right at the top, and mail from them began
arriving again.

Why does Red Hat do that, I wonder. They're sitting side by side in the same

Ok... since I'm not going to be using a channel, but rather the direct
A/V in... is that going to cause problems?  Nevermind. I'm sure it
won't...

Woowee!  That's a monster!  A man page reading we shall go!

Well, I had one TV show that was a solid 30 seconds out of sync by the
end of the hour.  You'd notice that, even with voiceovers... so I'm sure
it's playable.

Sweet.  If all goes according to plan, 0.9.0 (1.0.0?) is going to be
released tomorrow.  At least, that's according to Jaroslav Kysela.  I
think they've made some significant leaps and bounds in the last few
months.  I'm pretty sure my CVS date is about halfway between rc4 and
rc6.

So you're using mencoder all by itself, then?  On their encoding page,
it mentions only encoding things, and also multiple passes... does the
command above mix all the passes in to one?

A man page reading we shall go!  :-)

That sounds very much like the one at Fry's.  It was right around $50, I
want to say about $45.  It was mono and had zilch in the way of extra
features, but what do we really need, anyway?

Cool, thanks.  It's hard to tell with these things any more.  I'll bet
my Duron 650 is probably about on par with your 800MHz Athlon - a Slot
A, I bet?  So we should have roughly comperable results!

Again, I really appreciate the feedback!  A plan of attack is begining
to form!

Menu.1st is a link to grub.conf to maintain compatibility with older

Kyle...

I don't see that it's that big of a deal. My entire family uses IMAP
instead of POP, because we don't know which computers we are going to be
reading our E-Mail from. Depending on what your options are. You could
set-up a fetchmail to retrieve the POP3 E-mail accounts and put them
into the IMAP system. Or if you're fortunate enough your ISP provider
has IMAP already implemented on their side and they just let you have
access to it. :)

  I strongly dislike automatic numbering because it rarely formats as I want
and I end up spending more time forcing it to do as I want than it would
take to do it all manually. However, I cannot find where I turn off this
"feature". I've gone through Tools -> Options and Format ->
Bullets/Numbering and other such menu choices. Each of them gives me choices
for how I want the results to appear (within their limits, of course), but I
cannot see where to turn it completly off.

Anyone?

If I were in control of the process, I'd go back and double-check that BASH
is indeed the default user shell. I might have clumsily set my new users to
some other shell that doesn't use the .bash_profile or .bashrc

That's just my inexperience showing for the moment.

Message-ID: <F75a9rrasex8ZIvZPcB00016f33@hotmail.com>




Greetings,

     I am using sendmail 8.12.5 on my redhat 8.0. when I send emails from 
that machine,  I see a huge delay in delivering emails addressed to external 
email ids. Internal emails within our LAN are delivered instantaneously.  I 
am observing atleast 5 to 6 hrs of delay in delivering emails addressed to 
any of the external addresses. Could anyone please throw some light on this 
about what is happening and what should I do as a remedy for this. Do you 
think updating the sendmail would work?

Thanks in Advance,
sag.

Can you post a couple relevant log entries from /var/log/maillog, so 
we can see if sendmail is logging the reason why outbound mail is 
being queued?

Numbering is usually tied to the paragraph style.  Select the
paragraphs that numbering automatically and then do:

Format -> Paragraph

Numbering Tab

In the pulldown, select None.

This will turn off numbering in existing paragraphs.

Hmmm....wait a minute, you mean automatic numbering, where
you're manually typing a list in and it decides to help
by automatically detecting and formatting.  Try this instead:

Tools -> AutoCorrect/AutoFormat

Options Tab

Deselect "Apply numbering - symbol: *"

I think this is a per document selection.  Does anyone know how to make
this Rich's (and my) default?

  Thanks, Colin. There are too many places in OO.o where I need to go for
almost every document to get it to work as I want. IMNSHO, _all_ options for
default configuration should be in one place. And, paragraps options should
apply globally (even when changed in a specific document) rather than
one-by-one.

  It's a differen (i.e,, Redmondesque) approach, but one I don't find
productive at all.

  Been there; done that.

  The problem is also when one gets a winWord doc to use as a template/guide
and it has this stuff already in it.

  I've tried making all these choices in a blank doc then saving and making
it my default. Most of 'em aren't there the next time I open a new doc.
Sigh.

OK. My first hunch is that DNS isn't working correctly. On your Linux 
box, run

   dig hotmail.com mx +short

You should *very quickly* see an answer like this:

  5 mx3.hotmail.com.
  5 mx4.hotmail.com.
  5 mx1.hotmail.com.
  5 mx2.hotmail.com.

If you look in "Format" there is an "AutoFormat", in there uncheck
"While typing" to turn off the autoformatting.  You can run the
formatter later if you still need the canned looked.

Good Luck

OK, now we need to see if your Internet-facing IP address resolves 
correctly:

Let's assume that eth0 is your external interface. To find your IP 
address, run

host $(/sbin/ifconfig | \
  grep -A 4 eth0 | \
  awk '/inet/ {print $2}' | \
  sed -e s/addr://)

(Change eth0 to the actual interface you use to connect to the 
Internet.)

You should see something like

  56.232.187.66.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer www.redhat.com.

Or, you may see something like

  Host 200.33.95.129.in-addr.arpa not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)

If you see the second form, that's bad. It means that some mail 
servers won't like receiving mail from you.

  It's been off, Derek. Thanks for the pointer.

  The problem with this one file may be that it was sent to me by an agency
staffer and was created with winWord. It may not be possible to get it
turned off in this case.

That is just too much power in a document, I really hope you're wrong.

The Hauppauge WinTV GO model 190 works pretty well.
The Aver TV Stereo seems to have problems using the correct sound channel. On higher channels you get Spanish, etc. Plus, my unit picks up a lot of interference.
I bought the Hauppauge and haven't had any issues since.

Ok... since I'm not going to be using a channel, but rather the direct

Well, I had one TV show that was a solid 30 seconds out of sync by the
end of the hour. You'd notice that, even with voiceovers... so I'm sure
it's playable.

Sweet. If all goes according to plan, 0.9.0 (1.0.0?) is going to be
released tomorrow. At least, that's according to Jaroslav Kysela. I
think they've made some significant leaps and bounds in the last few
months. I'm pretty sure my CVS date is about halfway between rc4 and
rc6.

So you're using mencoder all by itself, then? On their encoding page,
it mentions only encoding things, and also multiple passes... does the
command above mix all the passes in to one?

A man page reading we shall go! :-)

That sounds very much like the one at Fry's. It was right around $50, I
want to say about $45. It was mono and had zilch in the way of extra
features, but what do we really need, anyway?

Cool, thanks. It's hard to tell with these things any more. I'll bet
my Duron 650 is probably about on par with your 800MHz Athlon - a Slot
A, I bet? So we should have roughly comperable results!

Again, I really appreciate the feedback! A plan of attack is begining
to form!

Can anyone recommend a good, 'it just works,' GUI program which allows a 
microphone plugged into the jack to record sounds into MP3?

Audacity will do that, although I think it is a two step process.  Record 
your signal (it uses a unique format for it's temp files), then export to mp3.

You can find rpms of the older stable version, but enough new stuff has been 
added/fixed that's it worth the trouble of building the latest (1.1.1) from 
source.  IIRC you need to turn on mp3 cabability at build time, and you'll 
need the mp3 libs as well as a few other packages.  It'll do ogg, too.

$ ./configure --help

The docs are good and the app itself is pretty nice.  It is a waveform 
editor with just enough stuff without getting cluttered and overly-complex.

SCO'S LAWSUIT IS FUNNY, BUT NOT 'HA-HA' FUNNY
     (Source: LinuxWorld.com) Showcasing a questionable
understanding of the history of Unix, open-source software and
computing in general, SCO's lawsuit against IBM has sent
shockwaves rippling across the IT community. Parts of SCO's
complaint would be laugh-out-loud funny if only the possible
repercussions for Linux and open source weren't so detrimental.

This is going to be a stupid question I am sure, but I can't find it in
any of the books I reference.
 
I am finding that when I use basic commands that appear in my UNIX/Linux
books, I am returned with 'command not found' - commands like PS1=,
aliases, tree, ed
 
My first thought was that it had something to do with the shell I was
using.  I admit I do not have a strong grasp on the difference in
shells, so a lot of it is guessing.
 
When I switch to tcsh, I get the same error.
 
I thought maybe I needed to add something to my PATH, but can't figure
out what that would be

Could you post some specific examples of what you are trying to do and
what the response is?  'PS1=' isn't a command, as far as I know. Neither
is 'aliases'.  'tree' brings up some sort of Motif demo. ('ed' does bring
up ed.)

My son was... shall we say tinkering and now I can't FTP to my Mandrake 8.2 box.
I've un-installed proftp and re-installed but still can't access the system. I 
can ping the port but as soon as I try to start a ftp session I get:
'Connection closed by remote host' if I do it from windows. If I try to ftp from 
the system to its self on either the private IP (192.x.x.x) or Public 
(216.x.x.x) I get: 421 Service not available.

Best I can get out of my son is #1 He tried to install "some" ftp server and #2 
that he was messing with User IDs.

I've used the Software Manager and don't see any other ftp servers installed.

Anyone have a suggestion as to where to start to fix this thing?

Thanks

Well, and I hate to overstate the obvious here, start with changing the
root password so this doesn't happen again. Sounds like supervised use
is prudent here.

Did you look into proftpd's conf file to make sure that you still have
an account setup? Might look at the owner of the filesystem that your
exposing with proftp too, make sure that the user that runs the ftp
daemon still has permissions. Also, if I remember correctly, proftpd
does write to /var/log/<something>. Take a look there to see if it is
starting and if there are errors that you can track. Take a look in
netstat -tl to see if port 21 is up too. If port 21 is not active you
might try manually starting it from a root prompt, normally done from
running the command `/etc/init.d/proftpd start` from a root user.

Best of luck to ya.

Interestingly enough, a lot of folks view this as a plea from SCO for
IBM to purchase that failing company. SCO's reported net worth is about
25 million, that's less than IBM will spend on a legal defense here.

  That was pointed out in the article. Heck, IBM could get this thrown out
for much less; their attorneys are probably preparing a motion to dismiss
right now. They should win that.

Do we have to worry about it? If the courts rule that
some of the code in our "free" operating system is
proprietary, does this mean that, at least in the case
of commercial servers running Linux, they will have to
pay for an OS license or remove parts of their code?

What's a good way to do a screen copy (preferably of a region of the
screen as opposed to the whole thing)?

Alternatively, I can zoom in on a part of a document in gv, is there any
way to save the zoomed in section to an eps or something similar (I'm
trying to copy a graph from a ps document).

There's that 'capture' program from... I think... ImageMagik... but the
way I'd do it is just crop a screenshot from the gimp.

xv lets you drag a region with the middle mouse button, under the grab option.

I find the gimp is more reliable though, as Rob mentioned.

If you use Acrobat, you can copy and paste both text and images, if you
convert to PDF.  Sorry, I'm not sure about how to do it directly from PS
(although GIMP might help).

You forgot to add to that the usual amounts of money they'll throw at
Darl McBride & associates to go away. (Do you expect IBM to keep this
bunch of wankers as employees?) When I worked at GST, I heard that one
senior VP was given a million dollar severance package when she was
let go -- & a few months later GST declared bankrupcy. I'd figure that
it'll cost IBM about $10 million to properly dispose of the executive
staff who launched SCO on its final adventure.

On the other hand, does SCO have $25 million cash to make a proper effort
to litigate against IBM? SCO probably can afford a few million to pay
Boies & a small staff for a year or two; IBM probably can spare that many
salaried staff lawyers for an unlimited time to simply crank out enough
paperwork to bleed SCO dry. And SCO/Caldera hasn't had a profitable
quarter in quite a while.

It would be a great service to the FOSS community if IBM did call
SCO/Caldera's bluff, go to court, & when SCO/Caldera had to give up their
case because they ran out of money to pay their lawyers, IBM offered
to settle if SCO/Caldera surrendered all of their remaining assets.

Frankly, all of this is entertaining talk, but until we see the first
legal manueverings in this lawsuit, all any of this is just talk. I
wouldn't be surprised if SCO's case is dismissed with prejudice in the
first hearing. Then again, I've been wrong about this kind of stuff
before: they might go to court & actually win, or convince IBM to
buy them out.

The GIMP worked great.  I hadn't used it for a while and didn't realize it

I am searching for a software to remove/uninstall a package which was

I used 'google' making searches and came to GLINT.  However a guy from

Any folk on the list knows what will be the solution?

All I can say is that taint checking in Linux is a good thing.

The way that I read this SCO "last ditch effort" is that they, in a
nutshell, are trying to extend their patents to ideas - and that's not
allowed; you can't patent an idea. If this were possible, we would have
one GUI and Xerox would own it. 

There is also some question about whether the actual Unix patents were
even transfered from Novell to SCO when Novell divested.

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.  Often, you must remove 
all of the installed files manually.

Well, first of all, a tar file is not an rpm package.  Here are a few commands 
for dealing with tar files

tar tvf file.tar  (lists files in the tar archive)
tar xf file.tar   (extracts all files in the tar archive)

See the man page for tar for more information.

I have following points expected to be clarified.


1) Which command shall be more appropriate to find out the newly 
installed files

'whereis' or 'type' or 'find' or others?

2) How to confirm which are the recent installed files and which have 
been already existing before installation.

3) If remove the installed files manually how to avoid removing other 
files having a link to the installed file

Thanks in advance.

1. USER will need write access to subdirectories in /usr/src/redhat.

2. Are you sure that AAA.tar has a .spec file inside it? Not all 
   tarballs ship that way...

3. Assuming that 1. and 2. are true, and it still doesn't work, you'll 
   need to do something like this to capture the error messages:

   rpm -tb -vv tarball.tar.gz | tee /tmp/rpm-errors.txt

   The resulting /tmp/rpm-errors.txt file will likely be very 
   instructive.

I know this is a moot point now, but just to be complete, the AfterStep

I'm wondering what the relationship is between SCO and The
Open Group. Isn't the Open Group the caretaker of the Unix
brand name and didn't that happen when Novell rid itself
of Unix?

The situation also represents an opportunity for IBM to hammer some positive
messages about Linux to the marketplace -- their commitment to Linux, the strong
future of Linux, that Linux is a disruptive technology in a positive sense,
etc. In addition to the money spent defending themselves, IBM ought to commit
to a significant marketing campaign to drive some of these messages home...
kind of a reverse of what Microsoft uses marketing for with regard to Linux.

> SCO SUES IBM OVER LINUX, SEEKS $1 BILLION
A few things:

1. This is SOP for Caldera (now SCO). When Caldera was first
formed, three business units were formed. One marketed Linux,
another marketed embedded operating systems, and another was
established to sue Microsoft. This third business unit
acquired DR-DOS and then sued Microsoft for unfair trade
practices. Caldera prevailed and won an undisclosed
settlement that was never disclosed but many guess was in the
neighborhood of $400 million.

2. Before Caldera was formed, Project Corsair at Novell
resulted in Linux kernel code for Novell's IPX protocol. The
code was sent to Linus Torvalds and (via Alan Cox I imagine)
was included in the kernel source tree. When Caldera was formed,
that code was probably purchased from Novell. That code should
probably be removed from the source tree. Sorry, I'm an informed
but not authoritative source for this information.

3. I've decided to no longer mention UnitedLinux in my books
and articles. SCO needs to know that this action may cost
them their business. SCO's partners in United Linux need to
know this as well.

4. The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) has plans to release
a UnitedLinux certification. Perhaps they need to know that
this could put their normal Linux certification program in
jeopardy.

5. This affair has the Linux community rallying to IBM's
side. This is understandable given IBM's support for Linux
but let's not forget that IBM is an Intellectual Property
(IP) powerhouse as well. They could very well be a similar
threat in the future.

6. If you want to minimize IP risk, you should choose a
Linux distribution that's not directly tied to IP owners.
This makes Debian and Slackware all the more appealing.

I'm running a program as part of a distributed project folding protiens.

The thing is that I want to run the program, but I need to close the terminal. At 
the suggestion of some helpful individuals on the list, I'm using nohup. 

It works like a champ. Unfortunately the program generates a little graphic of the 
protien it's folding and nohup thinks of this as somethig tht needs to be logged to 
nohup.out. When nohup.out fills that partition, it causes me pain. Being a true pain 
avoider, I'm interested in a fix.

Can I delete the nohup.out file in a cron job? A dialy rm should do it, but will I 
cause any problems with this approach?

Nohup.out is only created if you do not redirect output of nohup yourself,
it's like a default redirection. So redirect it to /dev/null instead.

How about running the client in quiet mode. Then you wouldn't have a file to get rid of.

  From the distributedfolding client readme

     To run the client in quiet mode (i.e. no output whatsoever to the terminal),
     simply edit the foldit script (foldit.bat on Windows) and add "-qt" (without
     the quotes) to the end of the line containing "foldtrajlite -f protein -n
     native".

if you don't want to save any of the data,

mknod ./nohup.out c 1 3

(it'll make a nice little /dev/null for your nohup.out)

Message-ID: <3E6F8AB0.40703@pacifier.com>

Okay, it's been awhile and I can't find the answer in the places I've looked 
(duh).

Problem is that a directory mounted via fstab (or manually by root) gets a 
uid/gid that doesn't otherwise exist on the client.  Therefore, no one has 
access.

Added no_root_squash to prove that my method is otherwise working.  And root 
can now `ls`, but this is to be for user home dirs.

I understand, that ideally, the user (let's call him `test`) should have the 
same uid/gid on both machines, but I don't want to do this.  I also don't 
want him squashed to anonymous.  Is this a job for NIS? or is there an 
easier way?  (Maybe NIS is easy...)

(From what I gather, automount wouldn't help this problem)


===========
server's /etc/exports
   /home/test	192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0(rw,no_root_squash)


client's /etc/fstab
   192.168.0.100:/home/test	/home/test	nfs	size=8192,wsize=8192


once mounted, /home/test looks like
   drwx------    2 502      502          4096 Mar 11 20:57 test


/etc/passwd says
   test:x:501:501::/home/test:/bin/bash

It's more than 'ideally'; more like 'mandatory' ...

Well, there's the hack of exporting each home directory with different 
anonuid and anongid settings (see the exports(5) man page), but I find 
very few good reasons to recommend that course of action.

Honestly, there's no substitute for a consistent uid/gid set across 
hosts. Until there's a common client/server mechanism for agreeing on 
authentication and authorization (NFS v4 maybe?), you'll have to 
suffer with sync-ed passwd files, NIS, or LDAP.

NIS isn't trivial by any means, but it's not that hard:

  http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/NIS-HOWTO/index.html

On a small network, I'd just sync the passwd and shadow files, or 
parts thereof.

>(From what I gather, automount wouldn't help this problem)

Yes, the user must have the same UID/GID on both machines, or it won't 
work. That's why many (most?) automounting home directory setups use NIS or 
LDAP. With a central user repository, the user automatically gets the same 
UID/GID on any machine they log into.

Automount won't help, because automount would simply be automating the nfs 
mounts, when needed.

Can I ask why you don't want the user to have the same UID/GID on both 
machines? (I suppose I just did, huh?) That would be the easiest option.

  I'd greatly appreciate someone passing me a pointer -- by reference will

  The context for this question is that, apparently, Red Hat uses only login

Yeah, just read about NIS in Marcel Gagne's "Linux System Administration" 
and it looked messier than I want.  (Haven't looked at LDAP yet, it's always 
been on the list).  Maintaining uid/gid will be simple enough on this network.

Sounds like you need to run the network mounts through SAMBA.  It is
very easy to munge uid/gid for each "shared" resource.

I find that samba mounts between linux boxes is pretty stable, even if
the "server" goes down, the mount will usually just work when the
machine comes back up.

Good Luck

Thanks, I'll think about it.  I'm confused, though, by your phrase "the 
server goes down".  Those words just don't go together.  (Okay, I did ruin 
my 385 day uptime to upgrade from RH7.0->7.3; but it don't go down, I had to 
wrestle it.)

It's just like it sounds, one type of shell will allow you to login and
interact with it, the other has no login capabilities.  Bash is an
example of a login shell, /dev/null is an extreme example of a non-login
shell.  Debian uses /bin/false as a non-login shell.  This allows the
system to have users that are not allowed to login.  The user that sshd
runs under would be a good candidate for a non-login shell.

When I create a user that will only have ftp access, I change the shell
to /dev/null for that user, ftp still allows login, but no shell will
ever be presented if that user tries to login through ssh (or telnet, if
it is running).

Not having a RH box handy, I would have to doubt this.  This concept has
been around for a while, and I know you've at least got /dev/null :)

Look in your passwd file, what shell is the sshd user assigned to (the
last entry)?  Or the mysql user? Or the identd user?

Hey, you started it :) 

I was just thinking about the other day when I re-compiled the kernel on
the server for scsi emulation, then rebooted, forgetting about the
mounted share.  I realized what I had done, got worried, but the mount
was still there when the server came back online, no worries!

I love those long uptimes.  I had to move a couple of servers last
month, one (a lowly Pentium Pro) had never been on a UPS, and had 295
days uptime!

Hi All,

I hope this isn't to far OT, but I'm not sure where else to ask.

I have had the good (?) fortune of being placed in the unemployed SIG,
though not completely.  My former employer is now paying me a small fee
to keep an eye on the servers, but I'm no longer active in development
and testing.

This has placed me in the situation of having to become an independant
consultant.  So far so good, I've even found an open source accounting
package called Nola (by Noguska), that runs quite well in user-mode
linux (I did it this way because Nola seems to depend on specific
versions apache and php).  I've got it generating invoices, keeping
track of inventory, and spitting out summaries of all kinds of stuff. 
The problem is that it is "real" accounting software and I need help
figuring out how to set it up the general ledger part and then what to
do with it once it is set up.

Do any of you know of an open minded about open source accountant?

TIA

No Clinic this month. Sorry. Paul's busy and the rest of us will be
helping with security at the Waterfront Park anti-war protest:

  http://www.unitedforpeace.org/calendar.php?calid=2187

The next Clinic will be on April 19. I promise not to cancel that one.

No. This is not what Rich was asking.

The difference between bash as a login shell and bash as a non-login 
shell has mostly to do with what configuration files it sources at 
start time. The long answer is in the INVOCATION section of the 
bash(1) man page and the 'Startup and shutdown' section of tcsh(1).

Now wait. I don't think that's what's meant by a login shell. When
you login to a system, the shell that gets run by the login program
is your login shell. If you later invoke a shell for some other
reason, it's not a login shell. Once you're logged in and at a shell
prompt, enter "bash" or "sh". You've spawned a shell but it's not a
login shell. Some of the scripts that get executed by a login shell
are not executed by a normal invocation of the shell.

Gee, if I'm wrong about this, many of my students will be ticked off.
But, I've been wrong before - there was that time in 68...

Mark's right. To find out what files were installed and where you may be
able to do the following:

cd into the directory containing your source
make -n install > installation.log

Assuming that goes well, installation.log should contain a listing of
everything make did when it installed your program.

If we are going to propose different solutions, then here is an odd ball, might
be fun to build, might be useless, solution.

For a reason other than it being fun to try something different,  this a graph
of a comparision of the speeds vs NFS

 http://www.it.uc3m.es/ptb/nbd/img2.gif
"These are old figures now - taken under 2.0.36, as I recall, with a much older
version of NBD than the current one, but they're still useful. The testbed was
a pair of 64MB P200s on a 100BT switched circuit using 3c905 NICs. The best
speed I could get out of raw TCP between them was 58.3Mb/s, tested using
netperf. Of course, the current NFS implementations have improved too."


The hard part would be changing the users on the client if they are already in
use. 

1. Users on the clients need to have the uid start at 2000 instead of the usual
user id 500
Change the default in /etc/login.defs if you're setting up new users and then
create the users
To change already working users, log the user out and keep them out. Change the
user id in /etc/passwd and then chown the users directory, and all under it, to
be owned by the user.  

2. Setup a directory structure on the server for the export
Example;
/export/home/username1 
/export/home/username2
/export/home/username3
..

3. Using enbd;	http://www.it.uc3m.es/ptb/nbd/ on the server, set up the
exports using uid of the users as the ports for the export.
Example;

enbd-server 2000 /export/home/username1
enbd-server 2001 /export/home/username2
enbd-server 2002 /export/home/username3


4. On the client,  using enbd module, you would have a script that would mount
the export. 
Something with the minimum;
#!/bin/sh
MODPATH=/lib/modules/2.4.xx/drivers/block
insmod $MODPATH/enbd.o
PORT=`id -u`
enbd-client your.server:$PORT -n 4 /dev/nda 
mount /dev/nda $HOME

Thank you

I'm impressed - you were much less abusive than last time. Use of the
hoary stereotype about peace protestors being hippies doesn't help your
argument, but you *are* improving.

If you come down on Saturday, you can visit with tens of thousands of
Portlanders who disagree with your position. We had 20K people in
February, we're expecting twice that this time. Think about it for a
minute, thousands of old ladies, young kids, Greens, Libertarians(!),
Veterans, Democrats, Republicans, Catholics, Unitarians, Muslims,
Atheists, computer geeks, and - sure, why not? - hippies, all coming
together to oppose the upcoming invasion of Iraq. And those are just the
people who can make it out on a given Saturday. This is a much broader
coalition than anything Bush ever dreamed of. Trust me, it will be a lot
more convincing that a spun poll.

I wrote a shell script that reads a text file of names, addresses, etc.,
and then creates letters that are sent to a printer.  Everything works
perfectly...  except my manager doesn't like the plain text and wants to
use an Arial font and underline certain portions of text.

Is there some way I can pass the output of my script to something that
will make it an Arial font and do other formatting changes, and then
print it?  Is there someway within the plain text to specify what should
be underlined to the receiving program?
Thanks,

If you know just what printer you're using, you can embed escape codes in
the output to direct it to print as you've asked. Unfortunately, this locks
you into using that brand and model of printer for evermore. Likewise,
there's the problem of having to manually calculate line breaks, since Arial
is a proportionally spaced font.

A little more complex would be to learn PostScript. That, however is a whole
lot of work for such a simple change.

The simplest text formatting engine I know of would be something in the
family of runoff, roff or nroff, where you would embed formatting dotcodes
into your output text and then pipe your format tagged file through the
above-mentioned engine. There are other routines to format dotcoded text
into PostScript.

Getting it to print in an Arial-esque typeface isn't a problem; just
use enscript:

  enscript -f Helvetica12 --margins=72:72:72:72 filename.txt

To insert formatting codes, like boldface or underline, you'll likely 
end up using a word processor or spitting it into something like nroff 
or LaTeX.

Two questions:

1) Can we cancel the clinic for some other, right-wing whack-o cause from time 
to time, just so the rest of us don't get bored?

2) Could we find a gung-ho Hawk stand-in to run the clinic in times like 
these? (What if G. Gordon Liddy were a certified Linux network guru?)

The *entire* Riverdale High School is out on a field trip this week, there
is no way for us to make arrangements to have the clinic there.  So if
someone wants to organize a clinic for this month, they will have to find
an alternate venue.

Many years ago we did an "ad-hoc" clinic at a coffee shop.

I can just see Liddy holding his hand to the heat sink on his P4 just to

This makes more sense than my half cocked explanation.  You have to

downloaded the source for rxvt and recompiled and install, but am still seeing

Hi Dan,

Thanks for your advice.

I made following test

cd to the directory containing the untar files

# make -n install > installation.log
make: *** No rule to make target `install'.  Stop.

ALSO tried without space between '>'
# make -n install>installation.log
make: *** No rule to make target `install'.  Stop

CHANGED to the directory (dist) from where starting installation (such 
as ./configuration, make, etc.)

# make -n install > installation.log
No response.

Whether I have to issue this command immediate after installation. 
Because it is alreay 3 days passed.

If I removed all source files from the directory would it be sufficient 
removing the application.  OR I have to use 'locate' command to find all 
directory and sub-directories and remove all files there.  How to check 
before start whether such a erasion would not infect the OS and other 
applications

Thanks in advance.

B.Regards
Stephen

One further question off my head.  Could I do follows;

1) Untar all files from a AAA.tar.gz with

tar zxvf AAA.tar.gz

AND

2)
rpmbuild -tb /(directory containting all source files)/*.*  AAA.rpm

No. You need to have a .spec file to build an rpm. It's an absolute 
necessity. If AAA.tar.gz has a working .spec, then

  rpmbuild -tb AAA.tar.gz

will work. Otherwise, you'll have to write your own AAA.spec, make 
sure AAA.tar.gz is in /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES, and do

  rpmbuild -bb AAA.spec

There are, as someone else suggested, some tools available that 
automate the spec-building process -- but the only one I've used at 
all is cpan2rpm, and it works only with Perl CPAN modules.

Hi Russell,

Thanks for your link,

I have a brief browsing of its website and its short introduction.

However if I install 'CheckInstall' after completion of the installation 
of a software, can it works?

Nortor on Windows can do this job.  Is there a similar application from 
OpenSource

B.Regards

Subject: [PLUG] Old hardware and software
Message-ID: <001d01c2e926$4638ecc0$a5aee00c@motherdivine>

Friends,

Here are my two cents on the recent discussion of HB2800 requiring open source systems be considered; I heartily agree - the schools are another major candidate for migration to Linux as well.  I am super impressed with the good work being done thru Multnomah County ESD.  This is one of my inspirations to learn more about Linux and open source software.

But we need to think globally as well - Microsoft is - as seen in todays UN News;

UNESCO TO HOST MEETING ON RECYCLING OBSOLETE COMPUTER EQUIPMENT 

In the search for innovative ways to boost economies and drive development in poor countries, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is set to host an international conference to consider ways to recycle millions of obsolete computers collecting dust in the stock rooms of global corporations. 

Specialists from all over the world - including top executives from Microsoft and Digital Links International - will gather this Friday and Saturday at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris to discuss the recycling of millions of units of computer equipment that become obsolete every year, outstripped by rapid progress in information technology, but which could be extremely useful in developing countries. 

The goal of this first international meeting - "New Synergies for the Recycling of Information Technology Equipment" - is to learn about existing initiatives in the field and to draw up concrete proposals to include in a global strategy for more efficient use of recycled IT material. While computers, printers, scanners, software and servers come with three-year guarantees, many can become obsolete within a year of purchase, and some even within six months. 

Through a survey of 20 global corporations in Europe and the United States, UNESCO has learned that more than one million personal computers will be decommissioned in the next three years. The acquisition cost of these computers was probably more than $1.5 billion, but their residual value is likely to be less than $60 million. The top 100 global companies have an estimated IT stock in excess of 7 million PCs, and the top 1,000 may have more than 30 million. 

Although the immediate benefits of integrating computer equipment recycling processes in sustainable development programmes seem obvious, the prospect does raise a number of important questions. The participants are expected to consider whether this equipment can be used in a different social, economic and cultural context, how to finance the transportation of tons of recycled material, how to avoid conflict with local distributors, and how to guarantee that used technology will not add to pollution problems caused by electronic residue.

I'm not following your question, so if I'm not answering what you asked, I
apologize.

This is what I usually do.
1. untar the tarball
2. run ./configure --help
3. If there isn't anything you need to specify or options you need to change,
run ./configure
4. do a make
5 run checkinstall

This will make a rpm out of the "make install" process and then install the
rpm. This means you can uninstall the rpm and all the files will be removed. 

Thank you
Russell

Conventional loop

open (FH "file.txt");
while ($line = <FH>) {

I don't know nuttin' 'bout perl...

But could you use wc -l to get the number of lines, then your fancy perl
script to create a series, counting the lines backwards, then read those
lines to output?

I though about this approach, but
the file is being red, filtered and loaded into DB
all in the same time. 
So this is not a good solution for my case.
Thanks.

I'm a System Admin for an ISP here in the Portland Area, small but
locally owned.  In my humble opinion that lends itself to have it's fair
share of pros and cons.  Over that past nine years we've been in
business we for a very brief amount of time offered shell access.  While
I wouldn't mind opening our system back up to our customers to provide
shell access, my question is, is there really a desire for it anymore or
am I just such a geek with the command line that I'm out of touch? :)
As far as security goes, I know how to lock down my servers so there
really shouldn't be an issue but is the ruling opinion that - mostly
people that want to cause havoc are the ones who will use a shell or is
there really still a demand for such a service?  I would love to know
what people think and what specifically they think they'd use it for.

Thanks,

  I need a shell account when I'm traveling. That way I can dial into it
then ssh into my office network for mail, data or other information. Without
a dial-up shell account I don't think that I could access anything.

  My mail is delivered to my network so I need to log in remotely. Sometimes
I need to get files for a project from a remote location. If there's a way
of doing this without a shell account I'd sure like to learn how so I could
save the money I pay each month only to keep that access available.

You can't really "read backwards", because the O/S can't tell
you about line boundaries... your program has to discover that
for itself.

If the data is small enough to fit into memory, just slurp
it in:

    @ARGV = qw(your_filename_here);

    my @data = <>; # slurp it in

    for (reverse @data) { # reverse it
      print $_; # each line
    }

If it's too big to fit into memory, you'll have to read it forward,
note all the start-of-line boundaries, and then read it in chunks
in reverse.  Very easy to get slowly, harder to get fast.

Or, you can use DB_File to map a file to an array, which will sorta do
that for you somewhat automatically.

Doh! I forgot another high-level solution: If you've got a script to read
the variable data, then you can manipulate (if necessary) that script to
change the data file format to a tab-delimited or comma-delimited text file.

Once you've got that, you can use it as the data source for a mail-merge
operation in a word processor. I don't have OpenOffice.org available on this
computer, but I'm pretty confident that a feature this useful would have
been integrated into the project by now.

References: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0303121346000.9970-100000@cohiba.fork.com> <3E700237.8080701@icare.com.hk>
Message-ID: <200303130941.33270.mmartin@u.washington.edu>

Your 3rd attempt seems to have succeeded.  Now you need to look in the file 
installation.log to see what commands the "make install" command executed.  
However, this probably won't help you much until you develop a better 
understanding of how software building and installation works.

By default, the make command uses a file called a make file, which has the 
name Makefile (or makefile), in the current working directory to determine 
what actions to take.  If there is no make file in the current working 
directory, then make will fail stating that there was no rule to make 
whatever target was specified, as it did below for the target "install" in 
your first two attempts.

Target names, such as "install" below, specify which set of commands within 
the file to execute.  Target names are arbitrary and are determined by the 
author of the software.  There are a few commonly used targets, such as 
"install", and automated build tools (such as autoconf and automake) have 
standardized certain targets further.  But make files are not in any way 
required to have specific targets.  This means that there are no universal 
answers to your questions.

Each software package can differ in what it requires for building and 
installation and it is important to read whatever build and installation 
documentation the author or authors have included.  This usually consists of 
files with names like README or INSTALL but can consist of arbitrary files or 
sometimes can be absent altogether.  Software is even ocassionally built 
without using make at all, possibly with scripts or alternatives to make such 
as Cons.  If a piece of software uses make but doesn't include any build 
documentation, you might even have to read the make file directly to 
determine what to do.

Since the build and installation procedures can differ so much for software, 
"uninstall", i.e. removal, procedures also differ widely.  There is no 
universal way to remove a software package and what is required depends on 
what the installation procedure did.

For more information on make, see the make man page or the GNU make manual at

http://www.gnu.org/manual/make/html_chapter/make_toc.html

or read the make man page.

Here are a few words regarding your confusion about tar files and rpm 
packages.  A tar file is an archive that can contain any arbitrary set of 
files (and directories).  Tar files are frequently used to bundle source code 
and documentation together but can be used to bundle together any arbitrary 
set of files.  They are not intended specifically for software distribution 
and were originally developed to facilitate storing files on magnetic tape 
(hence the name tar = tape archive).  Even tar files that contain software do 
not have to contain rpm packages.  In fact, rpm packages are almost never 
found in tar archives.

RPM (Redhat Package Manager) packages provide a different way of bundling 
files (and directories) together that is specifically intended for the 
purpose of building, installing, maintaining, and removing software.  An rpm 
package is a completely different type of archive.  In fact there are 2 types 
of rpm packages, "regular" rpm packages and source rpm packages.  A "regular" 
rpm package contains the binary and supporting files necessary for installing 
a piece of software on specific hardware with specific libraries.  A source 
rpm package contains the source code necessary for building the corresponding 
"regular" rpm package or packages.  Source rpm packages may always be 
**manually** constructed from tar files containing source code.  However, it 
is not always possible to **automatically** construct a source rpm package 
from a tar archive.  Whether or not it is possible to automatically create a 
source rpm file will depend on the specifics of the build process.  If the 
software has a nonstandard build procedure, then automatic creation of a 
source rpm package will not be possible.

On a related topic, rpm packages themselves are not universal either.  
Debian-based systems use deb packages rather than rpm packages.

I suggest that you get a good general Linux programming or systems 
administration (whichever is closer to your interest) book, such as the Linux 
Administration Handbook

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130084662/qid=1047570347/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-8748629-6636168

which has gotten very good reviews.  I'd give you more references but I'm in 
the middle of moving and do not have my books or any more time to spend.

Here is what works for me.

1) Laptop with <linux distribution> installed 
and a supported modem. 

2) dialup access with local dialup numbers in the place 
you will be needing it, otherwise use a cheap calling card 
and a long distance number.

3) wvdial to establish internet connection

4) ssh into home machine from laptop.

5) scp any files needed.

With my new Red Hat 8 installation, I had no problems getting mail in and
out, but local mail would go undelivered. Instead of showing the relay as
"localhost" it would tack on the the domain "localhost.lankow.net" and
resolve that to an external IP. It would time out during the connection,
never deliver the mail.

As soon as I updated Sendmail from 8.12.5 to 8.12.8, the problem vanished.
The relay name returned to localhost, the messages are delivered in the
wink of an eye. I pass that on in case anyone else has the same issue.

Paul

Before I installed linux at home, I could not get by without shell access at
my ISP. It's now extremely rare that I ssh to shell1 at aracnet. But since I
don't yet run my own mail server, there is still one thing that shell
account does for me. It permits me to get the envelope information and tag
the email with an X-header so that, in spite of fetchmail, I can see to whom
the email was actually sent...


## capture the address that caused delivery (possibly empty if to here)
ENVELOPE_TO="${1:-sandy}"
ENVELOPE_TO=$ENVELOPE_TO at herring.org
:0 fh
|formail -I "X-Envelope-To: $ENVELOPE_TO"
$DEFAULT


(modified recipe thanks to Randal, virtusertable hack thanks to Sean[1] :)

Once I start handling my own MX, my need for a shell account will vanish.
However, I know from reading the local newsgroups that there is a core of
userGeeks who would bail if there were no shell. It's one thing that helps
to set an ISP apart from the mindless morass of aol/earthlink/etc morons.

I wouldn't consider any of this critical, but here's what I have found
useful about shell accounts:

- Easy and fast access to my email from anywere on the net. Most ISPs now 
provide a web-based interface to email, but many of these are pretty lame, 
pretty slow, or not on a secure server. The situation is improving, but
for speed and security it's hard to beat ssh->bash->mutt.

- At one time I did my own spam filtering with procmail on my shell 
account, cutting down on what I had to drag through my modem. Now my ISP 
has instituted its own filters, so being able to implement my own filters
is not so critical.

- Lastly and least concrete, it's nice to have a place to call my $HOME
away from $HOME. 24x7 broadband is not available where I live and probably
won't be for many years if ever. So I don't have ssh/scp access to my 
box at home. My ISP shell account is a "place for my stuff" (ack to George 
Carlin) when I'm cut off from my real $HOME.

If I ever did get 24x7 ssh/scp access to my home PC from the Internet,
then I'd be hard pressed to find any remaining uses for my ISP shell
account.

10 of thousands of fools.  Are we to ignore the modified Al-Sahud
missiles that are ready to plaster their poor victims with chemical and 
biological agents.  Saddham said he didn't have any and then the U.N. of
all organizations found some in Iraq of all places.  Shame on the war
protestors, more have died under Saddham than will die in a war to 
depose him and Iraq cannot reform with an iron fisted dictator even if
supposedly the Iraqi people love their leader.  Besides, since when does
anyone get 90%+ approval anytime you check?  Portland like's Saddham
because too many people here have about the same lack of respect
for life and others just think that money is at the heart of every problem,
kinda like Clinton.  I don't like the war idea, but I'm not one to stand by
and watch the culture of terror and bitter oppression of a whole nation
stand either.  If you truly deserve to be American you won't stand by
either unless you can come up with a peaceful solution that will
actually work.

They think people in the MidEast think like we do and have similar basic
values.  They don't realize there are people out there you simply cannot
reason with.

They seem to believe everybody has a right to believe as they please,
and live as they please, but then don't realize oppresive regimes like
our ol' buddy Saddam runs put a dead halt to any personal freedoms.

Many of them actually believe war with Iraq will be over oil.  I'll bet
the more intelligent protestors must cringe at the signs about the US
attacking Iraq to take its oil.  ;-)

Many of them seem to believe, no matter what, there is a diplomatic
solution to everything.  They fail to notice the results of ending the
last war over there with Saddam still in power.  I believe some three
thousand Americans died at home as a result of that.  They also don't
care about Saddam flagrantly thumbing his nose up at the whole world by
continuing with weapons programs banned by a treaty he agreed to (albeit
with the entire US military aimed at Iraq - but that's reasonable).

Many of them also seem to think they have a better understanding of the
situation than those with actual power to act.  They think they know
better than our leaders, most of whom seem to be in favor of military
action.  They  know things that haven't been released to the public for
security reasons... but we know better, for sure.

Finally, and most surprisingly to me, they seem to believe their walking
around, screwing up traffic, and waving signs is going to make a
difference.  The general consensus around the country is that military
action is justified.  Extremists are not going to change the overall
opinion any measurable amount, nor are they going to convince our
leaders to change their minds (except in the case of ol' Vera Katz, or
however you spell it - she'll jump on any bandwagon she thinks will land
her on the news).  Without popular support, the powers that be were
gearing up for war.  Now with popular support, a few sign-wavers aren't
going to be changing any minds.

And I can hear the emails coming... we should take this off-list, it's
totally off-topic, why argue about this here?  Dan brought it up again
with his advertising of a peace protest and implications of fradulent
polls - I sure as hell am not going to drop it this time.

Traceroute?

I suppose PS1=xxxxxx isn't a command per se, but I was under the
impression I could use it to change my prompt.  I am not sure where it
is located as a file, but according to what I have read, typing the new
prompt would return the changes, albeit temporarily for that session.

I added an alias to my .bashrc file where I found other aliases and it
never worked.  It always returned a 'command not found' error.  I
thought that I could also type this at the prompt to create an alias for
the session.

I am in bash.  In the distant past when I actually used UNIX, I remember
using tcsh.  That was 10 years ago, so I am learning it all over again.
So far I am just proving that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing

Could you post some specific examples of what you are trying to do and
what the response is?  'PS1=' isn't a command, as far as I know. Neither
is 'aliases'.  'tree' brings up some sort of Motif demo. ('ed' does
bring up ed.)

The way I read and filter mail and manage my web sites (plus stuff I
can't think of :-) require shell access.  I use procmail to forward
mail, reply automatically, run it through scripts to gather
statistics, etc.  Some of my static web pages are generated, or need
to be edited frequently, and while I could do that on another machine
and upload the results it's much easier to just 'cd public_html; make
site'.

Also, having an ISP I trust (and know isn't running Windoze :-)
professionally maintaining security around their site lets me keep
that account as an entrance to the servers I run at home (since I
travel a lot and am frequently sshing in from new locations).  If I
opened them up to the world at large I'd have to pay a lot more
attention to securing them than I have time for.

That said, without shell access at an ISP I'd simply configure a home
system to do what I now do there.  But I'm not excited about running
my own mail and web servers and all the rest.

No it's not, but yes, you can. :)

The PS1 part is an environment variable, not a command. The command used to 
"install" environment variables is "set" or "export". Use "man set" or "man 
export" for more information on those two.

The "xxxxxx" part is the value you are placing in the PS1 environment 
variable.

I hope that helps.

Dear PLUGers,

We would have mentioned this last month, but didn't want to disrupt the
timing of the last PLUG meeting (PDXLUG had their first meeting the same
night...) and we wanted to test the process internally first.

We are working on a few group projects for the Portland Linux User Group 
(PDXLUG) community and would like to extend our efforts to all of you here
at PLUG. We have setup an online library using an opensource web app to
manage/track books that we are sharing with each other. At our monthly
meetings we are lending books to each other based on the requested books
that people have reserved throughout the month before. We currently have
over 115 book titles in our online library and many more are being added
on a regular basis as people find time to add their book titles to the
database.

If you're interested, stop by http://library.pdxlug.org/ and you can demo
it with user: guest pass: guest

If you want an account, please email me with the following:
desired username:
full name:
email address:

Thanks,

Robby Russell

I guess I haven't been paying attention. There are TWO Linux
user groups in Portland with nearly identical names?

And meetings are on the same night?

Was this confusion and contention deliberate or was someone not
thinking?

Portland Linux/Unix Group and the more traditional Portland Linux Users
Group.  It's easy enough for me to tell them apart, especially their
short names - pdxlug and plug.

> And meetings are on the same night?

It was this month, but I think they're planning on switching it in the
future.  There was/is a poll up on the pdxlug website trying to find out
when an ideal time would be.

> Was this confusion and contention deliberate or was someone not
> thinking?

There doesn't seem to be as much an overlap in members as one might
think between the two LUGs.  When the date was first set, I think I was
one of two who mentioned it was on the same night as the PLUG meeting.

The date was decided on the IRC channel, where apparently everybody is
in PDXLUG but not PLUG.

Well, as they say, "democracy is ugly". Personally, I think it's good that
this issue is getting some air time here. Our President is using the
ongoing state of war as a context to strip us of our civil rights. If we
don't broaden the scope of our conversation beyond Linux/Unix, we may
discover down the road that we no longer have the right to discuss Linux.

We can't hide in the server room until it's all over. :)

Not deliberate at all.. just so happened. We only expected the few of us
who are regulars in #pdxlug on irc.freenode.net and we ended up with many
more people than we expected. We are probably going to change meetings to
the first tuesday (or friday) of the month to avoid this problem in the
future.

You mean facts and rational arguments like saying our President is using
the state of war to turn our nation into one where discussion of a topic
like Linux is illegal and will get you imprisoned?

If that is rational to you, then I am happy to be included in your plonk
list.  I so rarely get to be added to killfiles these days.

Ever wonder what publically stating your plonk list status does?  It
sounds like an insult and disrespect to me.  Pot-kettle-black.  :-)

     Nice sound byte, now what exactly is that referring to?  It's interesting
that you say that yet many polls on the news show his approval ratings are
higher than normal.  Not everything is a civil right either.  Air time?  
Mostly what we've heard on the news is the reasoning of the opposition 
to war.  Bush's leadership waiting to go to war in hopes of getting a
resolution that Blair needs from the U.N. has been soft petaled.  This 
isn't a police state, protestors often overstate themselves here.  The 
federal government has the mandate to protect the public at large, 
always has.  If you want to talk about rights you have to talk about 
responsibility too.

For that matter, when was the last time anyone heard about the pope's
efforts to negotiate peace?  The media is clearly trying to make a point.
The funniest thing I saw was Tom Brokenjaw or maybe another reporter
asking troops preparing in the middle east about the coming war with
Iraq very leading questions and every one of them said he/she is
neither tired not deterred from the mission.  The reporter sounded like 
a jerk trying to reveal a morale problem.

Subject: [PLUG] Port forwarding mail port, raises question.
Message-ID: <20030313200536.9883.qmail@ns1.robinson-west.com>

The gateway I have set up can generate mail for system errors and the like.
It's not my hub so ordinarily I'd set it up as a null client.
But because I'm using ipmasqadm to expose my mailhub I don't know how
to set up an MTA on this machine.

At first I thought I'd set up postfix as a relay and a null client if that's
possible.  Essentially this relay would recieve mail from the hub on it's
way out and would be responsible for sending it on.  As a null client,
the locally generated email would go to the hub as it should.

I guess I could just check gateway mail on the gateway and not worry
about setting up an MTA there.  Maybe fetchmail is my friend here.
Or I could try samba exporting the gateway's mailboxes.  Don't want
to add NFS as it is bad enough that I'm using wuftpd.

That's correct, but there's a difference between dial-up internet
access and shell access. Most ISPs these days will not allow you to
dial-up and gain shell access. Once you log in a PPP link is immediately
established. I presume this is because the demand for a shell account
is so low it's not worth whatever extra effort it might take. At least,
that's my understanding. :-)

Paul,

  I guess that I've been missing something here. Unless I have a shell
account, to what am I connecting via ppp when I call the ISP's phone number?
Don't I want a system prompt so I can then ssh to my network?

Two points:

You have a "shell prompt" on the system you are dialing from.  Once
you have an IP connection to your ISP, slogin (or whatever) to the
system on your office network.

                                      ------
   +--------+        +-------+      (        )    +---------+

                                      ------

You dial-in from the remote system to your ISP over a modem.  ISP
gives you an IP number.  You run slogin on remote system, connecting
it to the IP number at your office.  Everything just works.

Or was there something complicated?

You use the shell prompt on your laptop to do the ssh.

To further expand on my previous post,

It's fairly easy these days to get an ISP who will give you a list of numbers
nationwide where you can get local access. 

Large ISP's have their own numbers in many cities, but smaller ISP's and even
the bigger ones buy numbers from dialup wholesalers like
http://usbackbone.net/
or even qwest
http://www.qwest.com/wholesale/pcat/wholesaledial.html

For instance locally, Pacifier has national numbers
http://www.pacifier.com/dialup/index.php

and Coho says they offer nationwide dialup
http://www.coho.net/PnSChoice.htm

Then there are the large ISP's like Earthlink who
have their own numbers nationwide and they also
resell wholesale numbers.
http://support.earthlink.net/support/ACCESS/

I am sure there are others.

Just make sure that the places you normally go 
are covered and that the
numbers in those cities are not overbooked. i.e
you constantly get a busy signal. It can't hurt 
as a precaution before choosing a provider to 
just pick up the phone, dial one of the numbers
you are interested in and see if it is busy.

If you log in and get a system prompt on the other machine, then you don't 
have a PPP connection. PPP is "Point to Point Protocol" and is used to make 
a (usually) network connection between two computers. When you log in and 
get a system prompt, you aren't making a "network" connection. You are 
(again, usually) using a terminal program to gain access to the remote system.

Subject: [PLUG] Weird "PortScans"
Message-ID: <E18tb8b-0001oh-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

Ok, I can't hold my peace any longer.
The webserver I administer is showing some strange behavior.
I installed SNORT on the firewall to help protect it's poor little IIS/Windows
2000 self, and one of the first things I noticed was that SNORT reported many
portscans -outbound- from "port 80" of our computer, all over the map for other
computers. 
So I firewalled off port 80 outbound (here's the iptables rule, to doublecheck
my work)

INTADDR=the internal (192.168...) IP address of the firewall (the default route
of the webserver)
WEBSERVER=the internal (192.168...) IP address of the webserver

/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $INTADDR -p tcp -s $WEBSERVER --sport 80
-j DROP

Patches appear to be up to date on the Win2K server, but... evidence is to the
contrary.  I installed Symantec's AntiVirus package; it's running, checking- it
finds nothing, even after a reboot when I expect it to find something on the MBR
and in the registry.

The only open ports on our webserver now are 20,21,80,443 and the PcAnywhere
port; they're NAT'd thru the firewall, while the ssh port goes to the firewall.

Today, we logged in to do some other work, and we happened to open up
netwatcher- and there are many many connections between our port 80 and one
dialup computer, on many many sequential ports on the dialup computer.  IE it
looks like either our server is continuing to scan other computers or that
dialup computer is doing something weird from many many ports all to port 80
(not completely unreasonable) -- that snort is reporting as a portscan from our
server.

If that doesn't make sense, it's because it doesn't make sense to me. 
Can anyone shed some light on this?

We've offered shell accounts for a long time, but we don't advertise it,
because no one asks about it.  It's possible to dial-in and get a login
shell, but it's usually easiest to get the PPP connection and then SSH
in.

You have a right to remain silent, but in a democracy you also have a
moral duty to speak up and hold your government and people accountable
when they do wrong.  Duty and responsiblity--aren't those things
conservatives are always going on about?  Propriety might lead one, on
the other hand, to limit one's discussion to appropriate forums.

This is my understanding: When you dial-up to your ISP, your dialer
program is met with a login/password prompt, and shortly after
authentication a PPP daemon is spawned that takes over the connection
and sets up an IP link to the ISP's host. After that, you effectively
have a direct connection to the ISP's network, which means you have
direct access to the Internet. It does not mean that you can login to
any of the ISP's servers and get a shell. You can, though, start up a
shell on your local machine and then use that to ssh into the remote
host of your choice (assuming you have an account on it).

When you dial-up to an ISP account that *does* provide shell access, you
never set up an IP connection between your local machine and the ISP's
host. The only connection you have is through your terminal app. You
could not, AFAIK, start up a local web browser and expect anything to
happen.

Anyhow... That's what I know. Corrections and clarifications welcomed.

  D'uh! That's right. I needed the shell account only when I was not running
my own mail server and would have to check mail they had stored for me.

Well, you could...back in the old days using something called "term" and

As one of the offenders, I DO subscribe to the Plug-Talk list. I probably 
get 20 messages in there all month. So in reality, traffic is NOT a problem.

SLIP emulators, anyone?

When I was at University of Portland, non-engineers (the unwashed 
masses) didn't get PPP access. We _did_ get a shell on dialup w/ a 
terminal app for using Pine. I used twinsock on Win95 <spit> to get a 
SLIP connection via my shell account.

Dial up w/ the twinsock client, start tshost and pray. There were _lots_ 
of apps that didn't play nice w/ the wonky winsock.dll, but I think 
Internet Explorer 2.0 worked. The horror, the horror...

The notion that when you dial up to an ISP that does provide shell
access you will never setup an IP connection is in my view false.  We
run 4 different access servers that handle the modem connections via IP.
When I originally posted my question I was talking about basically
handing the user control over their twenty megs of space so they could
from SSH edit PHP, or setup their mail, or do whatever they wanted
really.  I would be highly interested in what hardware an ISP would
still be using that gave a terminal right when the user dialed in.  That
seems like something that is pre '97 Internet if you know what I mean.
I remember dialing up before PPP got popular on the Internet and getting
right into the shell, but that was a LONG time ago, and it just so turns
out the ISP I was a customer of then I run now :)  Go figure...

Oh yeah.  I've got email in my archive somewhere of a conversation I
had with Deibele at Teleport about using it in September 1993.  This
was an era where PPP was not yet available on Linux, though SLIP was.
He was rather surprised and annoyed because it eroded his business
model of that moment.

  And I was quite upset when Teleport dropped SLIP support. I had been using
'minuet' under DOS for mail, Usenet newsgroups and ftp access to gopher,
archie (and its search engine, veronica) and WAIS. I had to install win3.1
just so I could get Eudora and Agent which supported ppp. Many e-mails went
back and forth on the subject.

  Now, of course, I understand the advantages of ppp over SLIP. But, I
wasn't aware of linux back then so I was stuck in the Microsoft world. And I
think that was the summer or autumn of 1993 because I was running my
business from the house then.

I just have one very important contribution to this discussion and then
it's back to plug-talk.

There are people who do not have your values and they live somewhere else
and you would like to impose your values upon them through military force.
If 11 September, 2001 should teach us ANYTHING, it's that killing people
is ugly and horrible and doesn't solve anything and, more often than not,
is just used to encourage more killing.

I'm going to skip all of Rob's regurgitation of the "justification" for
war that you can read in any mainstream newspaper or see on CNN.  However,
I'll note that they're all about Saddam Hussein and the regime in Iraq
and, therefore, show total ignorance of the situation and why the U.S. is
involved.

> Many of them also seem to think they have a better understanding of the

I have the same understanding as "those with actual power to act" (though
I would also claim to be a person with some power to act).  They told us
all about what they wanted and why they want it.

There's an organization founded largely by those in power today (Cheney,
Rumsfeld, Khalilzad, Jeb Bush, etc.) called the Project For The New
American Century (PNAC) that released a report in September 2000 (!!)
entitled "Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategy, Forces and Resources
For a New Century".  The report is available as a PDF here:
<URL: http://www.newamericancentury.org/publicationsreports.htm >

It's fairly safe to say that this is the opinion and strategy of the
people in power today.

The report is shockingly frank and straightforward and describes a world
domination plan where U.S. military and economic control is unchallenged
and U.S. dependence is mandatory for a nation to survive.

One of the most shocking aspects of this report is that it's ostensibly
about U.S. defenses, but concerns itself primarily with reshaping foreign
nations to align themselves with the ideals of the authors.  The unstated
truth being that the state they evision cannot stand up to fair economic
competition.

Anyway, it's an interesting read and I recommend anyone interested in
seeing the world from the point of view of the hawks in office go ahead
and take the time to page through the report.

For the purposes of this discussion, there is the following section from
the report (Section III:  Repositioning Today's Force):

"Indeed, the United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent
role in Gulf regional security.  While the unresolved conflict with Iraq
provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American
force presence in teh Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam
Hussein."

In other words, this has nothing to do with the Iraqi people and
everything to do with building up U.S. forces in the Gulf region
permanently.

"Although Saudi domestic sensibilities demand that the forces based in the
Kingdom nominally remain rotational forces, it has become apparent that
this is now a semi-permanent mission.  From an American perspective, the
value of such bases would endure even should Saddam Hussein pass from the
scene.  Over the long term, Iran may well prove as large a threat to U.S.
interests in teh Gulf as Iraq has.  And even should U.S.-Iranian relations
improve, retaining forward-based forces in the region would still be an
essential element in U.S. security strategy given the longstanding
American interests in the region."

This is about "American interests in the region" and not at all about
democracy and freedom for the Iraqi people.  It's not about improving
their lives or their standard of living.  It's about setting up permant
bullying stations around the world to beat the living shit out of anyone
who threatens anything on the planet that the United States might possible
want to claim for itself.

> They know things that haven't been released to the public for security
> reasons... but we know better, for sure.

Do you think that Microsoft's claim that source code was not released for
"security reasons" is valid?  It's no more valid here, sir.

There is no secret information withheld for security reasons.  The UK
report that claimed to be suppressed for security reasons turned out to be
plagiarized from a graduate student thesis, misspellings and all.

As a user of Free and merely Open Source software, you should realize that
no security is gained from secrecy.  It's an excuse.

They need the veil of secret organizations so they can do whatever they
want and pretend to have secret information to justify it.

As any sysadmin will tell you, security through obscurity is no security
at all.

Open government for a Free world.

Talking with Jim about *anything* technical was sure to leave you in a 
worse state than you were before. Ask the old krewe about Jim deleting 
the mail spool one night...

Still, I learned tons from my shell account at Teleport. Its login 
servers were the first SunOS systems I'd ever encountered, and they 
had a decent Perl installation, C compilers, the whole works.

Now, with my home Internet connection approaching 24x7, I think I'd
find a remote shell account is less useful. I just ssh to my home
machines from wherever.

If all I had was a dialup account, however, my choice of ISP would
definitely be tilted toward the outfit that provided shell access and
a few megs in $HOME.

(Returning to the original question.)

My opinion about your question is a qualified yes. Yes, in that there is
a small, but determined & usually clueful, group who want shell access.
At times, it is valuable to have an account on another host to troubleshoot
network problems, fiddle with procmail configurations, temporarily
store files, & lots of other occasional chores that make shell access
invaluable.

However, the vast majority of users could care less about this feature,
although a few might insist on having shell access vehemently, while
never using it & probably not know if their home account was set to
/dev/null & their shell to /bin/echo.

My advice is to offer it as an ``unadvertised special." There's a few
of us who will need it, & will ask for it -- & be grateful that you
offer it. The rest of your customers won't care.

Okay, so the user `test` can mount his home dir from a client machine.  The 
goal was to have two concurrent X desktop sessions running that share common 
data--bookmarks, mail, dotfiles, everything really.

I was afraid this would happen--mozilla doesn't want to play that game.  It 
sees that it already has a lock and forces me to create a new profile which 
seems unable to share bookmarks (not sure about mail yet) with the other 
profile.

This is the same thing that happens when using vnc.

Is what I'm trying to do even possible?

No; and I'm not sure where to start: a google search of "portscans emanating
from port 80" didn't show me anything enlightening. I'm pretty sure I got the
iptables rule correct; but the evidence (continuing scans) would prove me wrong
(unless the DROP at the end of the iptables rule confuses Windows 2000's net
monitor, which is possible).
Trusting Symantec to tell me that the IIS server doesn't have a worm on it makes
me uncomfortable, but the only evidence I can find is that it seems to be
"portscanning from port 80." Also, that server's reasonably up to date with
patches.

Are you sure that these are connections originating from your web

they "acks"?

You have to realize by now, that it is impossible for two different
users to use the _same_ X desktop independant of each other, that is a
contridiction in terms.  This would be almost like two operating systems
trying to share the same swap space.

The only way two people can access the same locked files at the same
time is to "share" the X desktop.  The Linux Journal had an article
about this very topic, "Sometimes, You Have to Do It Yourself".  The KDE
Desktop Sharing package is supposed to be in KDE 3.1, or if you are
running KDE 3.0 go to http://www.tjansen.de/krfb  The only tricky part
looks like the path to KDE is not the same for each distribution,
configure with the --prefix=<path to KDE> before doing the make.

It sounds like this is the same type of thing that happens when a
vncserver is run from Windows, where the remote connection is just a
fully controllable mirror of the "real" X desktop, but there is only one
focus, which either person can control.


Good Luck

I don't want two different users.  It would be one user logged into two 
machines simutaneously.

Linux Magazine also had an article last month about using xdmcp & vnc 
together.  It does seem like what I want requires the implicit approval of 
X, whether mozilla can deal with this setup remains to be seen.

I'm not sure I understand, one user, two machines, one home directory;
simultaneously?  You're trying to have two seperate instances (and
possibly versions) of Mozilla trying to access the same user files at
the same time?  Is this nested X desktops, or on two seperate machines
that the user uses at the same time, a one for each hand kind of thing? 
Wouldn't it be easier to cluster the machines (CPU load is the only
reason I can see for this arrangement)?

Mozilla will still only be able to run through one X session, unless you
define another profile for it. Seems like you're going to have problems
with mail, too.

Yes and yes, although I will only be using one of the two running mozillas 
at a time.

Not sure I understand what you're getting at, but the whole idea is to be 
able to surf and email from a laptop in the kitchen during coffee, then use 
the basement machine to do the same thing the rest of the day.

The thought was to export my home directory which lives on the basement 
workstation to my laptop.  Would work fine if X wasn't a requirement.

Subject: [PLUG] Add a hard drive without rebooting?
Message-ID: <1047683158.1673.13.camel@duron.stpaultel.com>

Hey everybody-

I just got a new hard drive for the server.  I'd like to, if at all
possible, install the drive without rebooting.

I understand Linux uses the BIOS only to get booted, then from there on
out, it pretty much ignores it and does its own thing as far as drives
are concerned.

Could I thereby just plug in a drive and somehow get Linux to find the
drive or am I going to need to reboot?

If I reboot the computer, I'm going to need to pull it out of the closet
and plug in a monitor, as the BIOS battery is shot.  That and I'd lose
my 159 day uptime.  :-)

It's an IDE drive, all IDE system, an FIC SD11 board, Via 686A
southbridge, AMD Irongate northbridge.  The second channel is not used,
the only IDE device in there is the current harddrive, and it's primary
master.

Anybody ever tried it before?  :-)

Rob

Rob,

  I'm not a hardware engineer but I've dealt with electronics and
electricity since about 1957. You risk blowing the entire box by taking off
a side and plugging in power cables while it's running. The slightest slip
and you've created a short -- at the very least.

  Uptime is nice -- for a stable system. It demonstrates that the server did
not need to be periodically rebooted just because. A deliberate shutdown for
hardware changes does not emasculate your manhood. Think of it as shutting
off your vehicle engine before refueling.

I haven't run in to any problems yet - and have been doing similar
things with CD-ROM drives.  Risky?  Sure... would I suggest anybody else
do it?  Absolutely not.  But I'd be willing to risk the short.

You sure about the no emasculation thing?  I dunno... but if you say
so...  :-)

Still, it is *such* a pain to reboot that system.  :-\

I have seen a command on my various travels around the web that tells the
linux ide driver to rescan busses, which is what you'd need to do a hotplug in
of a new drive.  There were MAJOR warning though on that web page that it
is extremely dangerous to use.  I don't remember the specific url but you
could probably google for it.

But I'd go along with the other comments that electrically it's very 
dangerous.  There are special connectors used in hardware that allows hot
plugins / changing / etc.  You do not see those connectors in a normal
"pc" motherboard.

  Then, by all means go ahead. I thought you were asking for opinions on the

I think Synergy would be a better solution.  It is a "software" KVM,
from another article in the Linux Journal
(sourceforge.net/progects/synergy2).  With the server running on one
machine (your laptop), and a client running on another machine (your
basement box), you can configure it so that if you slide the mouse off
of the desktop of the server, in a particular direction, it switches to
the desktop of the client.  Of course, to get back to the laptop, you
have to have the server running on the basement box, so that when you
slide the mouse off the desktop, it goes back to the laptop's desktop.

I saw that too.  Technically it's a KM (no V) switch.  There's no mention on 
the site if it can deal with diffrerent screen resolutions.  My server is 
running 1280x1024 24bpp, the laptop 800x600 16bpp.  Guess there's only one 
way to find out, but given how simple the config file looks, I'm doubtful.

Plus I'm really used to mousing through the screen edge to another 
workspace.  Changing that behavior to instead present another machine might 
freak me out.

Cheers,

Well, Rob is far from the only uptime-obsessed geek out there...

Okay, I admit it, I'm uptime obsessed too... to a point. I'll reboot for
kernel upgrades, but do like to advertise it via my `finger' page (see .sig)
and via an X-header, courtesy of Sven Gucke's finagle for `mutt'...

my_hdr X-Uptime: `uptime | sed -e 's/.*up \([^,]*\),.*/\1/'`

Correction - synergy is a software KM.  You need a monitor attached
to  both computers and when you go off the edge of one display the
focus shifts to the other one.

I started using it at work, we've got a good supply of monitors.  
The greatest benefit is being able to cut and paste between 
machines.

That's not a problem.  Synergy just controls where mouse and keyboard input
goes.  It doesn't interact with the displays at all.

I recently took one of mine down after more than a year, consolation
is being able to blow the banks of dust out of the thing with an air 
compressor.  Just wish I had taken it outside first.

As a former electronic tech I can vouch for the hazard of dust on circuitry, 
it can be conductive.  So multiple long uptimes may be better than going for 
a single record.

It helps if you can keep the table saw in another room.  At least the dog 
doesn't like to hang with me in the basement.

Yah, I know. Security patch to kernel :-(  Other than that, only power
fails that overtax my UPS take me down. For a period of two months, that was
an all too common occurence since PGE was "upgrading" capacity to accomodate
new housing in my area *sigh*.

At least, that's the case with my trusty P-Pro SMP web server. My other box
is dual-boot, so I don't even think about uptime. But I will post a question
about mkbootdisk & 2.4.18-24.8.0 not fitting on a floppy -and- trying to get
Win2k and RH8.0 to dual boot without a floppy (HOWTO didn't work for me)
this weekend, when I have more detail at hand.

Thanks, everybody, for the tips, hacks, and warnings...

I booted the system three times and am now on the new hard drive has
totally replaced the old.

Powered down, put in new drive as hdc.  Powered up and moved everything
over.  Powered down.  Unplugged old drive, plugged new drive in as hda. 
Put in tomsrtbt floppy.  Powered up, chroot'd into new drive, and ran
lilo.  Removed floppy and rebooted.  Now I'm here, everything seems to
have made it over ok.  :-)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0303142253100.3404-100000@shell1.aracnet.com>

I've been having this problem where my network gets slow (and ping drops a
lot of packets) after 3-4 days.
I found that if I rebooted the machine that does the IP masquerading that
the problem clears up.  Tonight I tried restarting the network script on
that machine as opposed to rebooting ( #init.d/network restart) and that
did the trick.  Prior to this I was looking for traffic with tcpdump, but
didn't find anything all that interesting (I was thinking that I'd find
that something was sending a lot of data around but I didn't notice
anything unusual).

Any ideas why I would need to restart the network script on this
machine every few days?

Phil

What kind of network card is it?  When you restart the network scripts,
I think you reinitialize the NIC... and some NICs (I hear the earlier
revisions of the 8139, for example) tend to poop out after a few gigs of
transfers.

A hack/workaround might be a cron job that restarts the network every
two days around 0300 or so, if that's a possibility, anyway.

I don't recall right off hand what kind of nic it was.  This problem just
started to happen in the last month or so.  I installed Mandrake 9.0 back
in December sometime and this problem probably started happening in
mid-February sometime.

I tried that once and could unmount drives, but inserting a new one
didn't seem to work.  Seemed to be an issue of the IDE bus not
rescanning or something.

Are you running portmap? If so, try restarting just that and see if it helps.

Message-ID: <000b01c2eb31$a9219370$f800a8c0@launi.com>

*** 
I did a search on the archives (http://plug.skylab.org/cgi-bin/htsearch) and
found nothing for IDE RAID.
***

I'm going to build a replacement Linux server for one of my aging servers
and want to do RAID 5.  I have done hardware SCSI RAID on Window$ so I know
how it works in principle.  I have never done software IDE RAID before.  I
have a few questions before I get started that may save me aggravation later
on. I understand that the Linux 2.4.x kernel supports software RAID and I
also know that in order to get the best performance you need your IDE drives
on one channel.  I want RAID 5 with one hot spare using 5 identical 72 GB
drives.

I'm open to using any Linux distribution that will make this work.  I have
used RedHat, Mandrake and Debian in the past.

 1. Can I just have my 4 IDE drives connected to two separate two channel
PCI IDE controllers and Linux will recognize them during startup?
 2. If I do buy a 4 channel controller (Rocket Raid 404) which does not
support RAID 5 via hardware, will Linux support it using software?
 3. Should I only use the controllers listed here
(http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO/ideraid.html)?
 4. If I'm not concerned about performance can I use one 2 channel PCI IDE
controller and connect the four drives (two on each channel)?


Basic RAID configuration questions
 
 1. If I use Linux software RAID without a hardware driver should I boot off
a single disk and then make RAID for just my data?
 2. If I have hardware RAID with Linux driver support can I install directly
on the RAID?

I'm on a budget and this is a home business system so that I can store my
clients graphic work.  If I can use one PCI card with 4 ATA controllers on
it at a cost of $100 then this would be ideal.  If I have to go with a
higher end SX6000 or Escalade 7500-4 ATA 133 RAID Controller Card then I
would have to spend about $300.  I'll spend the money if that's what it
takes to work, but I wanted to use Linux software RAID and did not want to
have to deal with third party hardware drivers.

I think the problem here is shell confusion - mixing commands between tcsh
and bash.  To change the prompt in bash, try 'export PS1=my_new_prompt'.

Look in the bash man page, under the INVOCATION section.  A login shell
reads /etc/profile, ~/.bash_login, ~/.bash_profile, and ~/.profile, in
that order, if they exist - a non-login, but interactive shell will read
~/.bashrc.

Subject: [PLUG] Introduction and my first question
Message-ID: <20030316014342.20072.qmail@web14204.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello Everyone,
I'm new to this list and this is my first post.  I've had a
Debian GNU/Linux computer, that I put together at FreeGeek,
for about 4 months.  In that time I've just used the
computer for word processing and the Internet.  Now I'm
trying to learn more.  I also have a 486 with W95 that I
got in 1994, however, I'm still not very knowledgeable
about computers, since I've not done much besides word
processing and using the Internet.  I've read most of the
Debian GNU/Linux Bible by Steve Hunger, but I still have a
lot of questions.  I hope that at least some of you will be
patient with me and helpful.

My attempt to learn more was precipitated by a desire to
install a new package by downloading a file from a web site
and saving it. I wasn't successful, which led to learning
that my sources.list file still points to
sources.list.freegeek.  I thought that meant I would need
to take my computer to FreeGeek to use apt-get unless I
learned how to redirect sources.list to my
sources.list.public file, so I posted a question about that
at www.debian.org.  Then I started thinking that I should
backup as much of my filesystem as I could before making
any changes.  I don't have the FreeGeek software on CD, but
Hunger's book included a CD for 2.2, so I suppose I would
be able to install that and then upgrade and restore my
backed up files.

I don't have any media for a backup other than floppies and
a hard drive of about 500MB that was originally in my W95
computer, so I've been thinking of installing the hard
drive as a slave for partial backups.  

So far about all I've done is start to become more familiar
with my online documentation and the software that is
already on my machine.  I thought it would be a good idea
to use dmesg | less to look at the output of the startup
process and try to learn more about what it all means. 
Rather than write it all down I wanted to print it to my
LaserJet 4L, but I don't know how to do that yet.

So my first question to you folks is: how can I print a
hard copy of whatever is on the screen in a text terminal? 
I know that in Windows there is a way to print a snapshot
of whatever is on the screen.  Is there a way to do that
with Debian when I am using a GUI too?

To istall the slave and use it for partial backups what
steps should I take after it has been physically installed?
       Will I need to change my BIOS settings?  Will I need
to partition and format the drive?

When I first brought the computer home I had a Princeton
Graphics Ultra 17" monitor.  That monitor seemed to be
about to burn out so I traded up to a Gateway 2000 17"
monitor.  However, the Monitor section of my
/etc/Xll/XF86Config-4 file still lists the Princeton
monitor and it's refresh rates.  My monitor seems to work
okay, but I would like to have the correct information in
the XF86Config-4 file.  What would be the best way to do
that?  Would running XF86Setup allow me to just enter the
information that I want to change, or would I have to
re-enter the configuration information for the whole
system?

I will stop asking questions for now and look forward to
getting to know you better.  I hope this hasn't been to
lenghty or too many questions for a first post.
Alan

Found a solution: close the unused mozilla & vncviewer.  Don't need nfs at all.

The March Linux Magazine has a cool article on how to make xdmcp listen to a 
local vnc server so that from any machine on the lan I can type `vncviewer 
my_host` and get a gdm (or kdm or xdm) login screen.  Avoids the extra steps 
normally required and you can make multiple resolutions available.  gdm/kdm 
allow you to select a more appropiate wm than sawfish (pokey even over 
100Mb) before logging in.

The article isn't available on their website for a few more months, but I'd 
be happy to summarize the steps if anyone's interested.

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

Hey Launi,

I'm going to preface my response by saying that I've only used software
raid (on ide) under linux, not hardware ide raid (though I've seen
others I work with beat their heads against the wall with hardware raid
driver issues).

To be pedantic, the 2.2 linux kernels also support software RAID, which
is what I'm using. My understanding is that the software RAID format is
the same between 2.2 and 2.4, but don't know about 2.5 (I know there's
been drastic changes in the LVM stuff, not sure how it's affected
software RAID).

AFAIK, they all will make it work. On the other hand, I have no idea
how well the installers handle it -- I set mine up manually long after
install time, as I was adding a mirror drive for a system without backing
up and reinstalling -- I had no backup device that could store the
amount of data reasonably.

I believe so, my raid 1 setup is two drives, one on each channel of the
ide controller.

Likely so (modulo my inexperience with hardware raid). Essentially you'd
be using it as a straight 4 channel ide controller, no raid as far as
the hardware device is concerned.

Dunno. You probably should also look at what the distribution you plan
on using supports for hardware raid, if that's the way you decide to go.

In software raid, I'm almost certain it will. All it looks at are the
block devices you give it, I don't think it has any meta knowledge about
them. You likely could be able to mirror across a mix of scsi, ide, cf
or other random devices, assuming they present themselves as block
devices (not having tried it, I don't this for sure, but it seems like
it).

You can, but you don't have to, you can have the root partition on raid
as well (I do this).  You will have to use an initrd (ram disk) with the
software raid modules (md) in it or have a kernel with software raid
compiled in so that the kernel has access to the software raid driver
before any of the file systems have been mounted.

Yes, I believe so.

I've been very happy with linux's software raid, though I've not had a
disk failure -- I did have to run in a failed configuration for a while
while I was moving my data from non-raid to raid. Personally, I'd lean
towards a raid 0+1 (or is it 1+0 that's the better of the two? I never
remember) if I had four disks and was willing to give up some space,
but that's just me.

Hope this helps.

Same would apply to email, just close it before going downstairs, the

upstairs.

Just put a "killall <program_name>" in a login script, or make aliases
that do this on a per-program basis:

ie: alias mozilla="killall mozilla-bin && mozilla"

This is basically what I do with mutt (I don't kill it, my alias just
displays the mutt processes I own if it's running, incase I just
forgot what desktop it's on).

This seems like a pretty rough hack though. Especially with something
like Mozilla, I routinely keep browser windows open for months at a
time while I wait for time to look at the page I left them on, so
killing moz. would axe all these.

I've heard rumors about gnome2.2 (metacity?) being able to move an app
from one desktop to another. Am I hallucinating or is this more than
rumor?

Your input helps, thanks. I'm going to going to buy one more SIIG IDE 2
channel controller and start putting the hardware together.  I'll then start
the install and try software Raid 5.

from what I can tell this bord will just show up as 4 ide controllers,
this should work, though might require some configuration.

A word of warning about ATA RAID: some controllers do not handle disk 
failure gracefully.  So while your data will be fine, do not expect your 
machine to stay up if a drive fails.  Specifically, I've heard this about 
the Promise cards.  I've heard very good things about 3ware, BTW.  And 
most (all?) RAID controllers will allow you to turn off RAID and do it 
all in software.

This is mostly true, but the newer Redhat distributions allow the creation
of raid devices during installation which might make this job a little easier.
Do other distributions support this?

I wasn't really thinking about inserting a drive when the box was running, just
that the box was in a closet and physical access was a pain. You did however
make me wonder. So if I get some time to play around this weekend,  I will try
hotswap at http://users.ox.ac.uk/~univ1377/c600.html. I don't believe there is
a way to hot swap a root drive, but a second drive might be able to be hot
swapped. The README states the program was written on a dell C600 but that
there are no hardware dependencies in the program. 

Thank you
Russell

Raid, hardware and software, plus LVM, which when using multiple disk can be
striped, are all avaliable on SuSE.

Message-ID: <3E74195D.2000602@pacifier.com>

Reference: Linux Magazine March 2003, "Simplififying Remote VNC Logins"

Required: vnc installed on server and client/s

My instructions for gdm on RH 7.3


Edit /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf

[xdmcp]
enable=true

---------------

Edit /etc/services, add

#resolutions you want
vnc-800x600	5900/tcp
vnc-1024x768	5901/tcp

---------------

Create /etc/xinetd.d/vnc-800x600

service vnc-800x600
{
	disable		= no
	socket_type	= stream
	protocol	= tcp
	wait		= no
	user		= nobody
	server		= /usr/bin/Xvnc
	server_args	= :1 -inetd -query localhost -geometry 790x572 -depth 16 -once 
-fp unix/:7100
}


Do this for each service you've added.  I knocked down the geometry to allow 
room for the window border.  If you use more than one resolution, increment 
the display number in server_args for each.  Use :2, :3 etc

---------------

Log out of X and restart.  Also restart xinetd.  ie. `service xinetd restart`

To check from the server itself, in an Xterm `vncviewer localhost`
If that works, try from a client: `vncviewer <hostname>`

Still working on adding to the wm selection from gdm.  There's more covered 
in the article that I've skipped, mainly firewall rules and kdm/xdm.
The mag should be available at your favorite Fred Meyers.

I am still using inetd:

vnc-640x480x8   stream  tcp     nowait  nobody.tty      /usr/bin/X11/Xvnc Xvnc -inetd -query localhost -once -geometry 640x480 -depth 8
vnc-800x600x8   stream  tcp     nowait  nobody.tty      /usr/bin/X11/Xvnc Xvnc -inetd -query localhost -once -geometry 800x600 -depth 8
vnc-800x600x16  stream  tcp     nowait  nobody.tty      /usr/bin/X11/Xvnc Xvnc -inetd -query localhost -once -geometry 800x600 -depth 16
vnc-1024x768x16 stream  tcp     nowait  nobody.tty      /usr/bin/X11/Xvnc Xvnc -inetd -query localhost -once -geometry 1024x768 -depth 16

Does anyone know how to make the server persistent (not die) when the
client closes the vnc window?  I've tried it without the -once
parameter, but it didn't work.

Thanks again,

"snort" claims they're originating from my computer.
And netmon (in windows 2K) claims a connection from (example only,
from memory, but the screen looks like:)

webserver:80    obvious-dial-up-12.224.221.23.dsl 10003 time-wait
webserver:80    obvious-dial-up-12.224.221.23.dsl 10004 time-wait

webserver:80    obvious-dial-up-12.224.221.23.dsl 10006 time-wait
webserver:80    obvious-dial-up-12.224.221.23.dsl 10007 time-wait

So either one dialup connection is connecting to my port 80 from sequential
ports on their computer or my computer is portscanning them.
Not sure about the SYN-ACK issue and I'll check that.

The author of the article said this was a problem.  Probably a function of 
x/inetd.

Message-ID: <3E752DCD.9BBB428B@attbi.com>

I tried to replace a CD-ROM drive on the secondary IDE controller (the
only device on that controller) with a CD-RW drive. I had some problems
and tried a new cable. With the new cable, the computer will not boot.
It will run the memory test, display Wait..., clear a couple of lines at
the bottom of the screen, and then sit there.

I put the old cable and the old CD-ROM drive back in the machine, and
got the same results. If I remove the cable and in BIOS tell the machine
that there is nothing on the secondary IDE controller, the machine will
boot.

The mother board is a Silicon Integrated Systems ATX style.

Any ideas?

You might double chec the polarity on the IDE cable, some 
controllers refust to boot if it's wrong.

I'm sure you checked it, but I do it sometimes, too

By "Polarity" do you mean Pin1/Red on the data cable???

Haven't tried, and I'm hesitant to mess around with it, since it's this
machine and if I've done something to fouled it up, I don't want to make
it worse. The CD-ROM used to work on the secondary IDE channel, but
won't now. Could I have fried the secondary IDE controller?

It looks like I did it right, but I'll try switching it to see.

That was it. I'm back to having the original CDROM drive working. I'll
try the CD-RW drive as a slave on the secondary IDE. I didn't do that
before because I'm using the power plug that would support that device
for an extra fan. If it works, I'll get a splitter tomorrow and just
keep both drives in the box.

Thanks again, Mike.

OK..

I have never thought of that as "Polarity"

I did something I shouldn't have done, installing a
Linux distribution into a 10-GB partition. This seemed
generous at the time, but now I have less than 3GB of
free space.

Could I move /home onto another partition? (Such an
unused partition is available on my system.) I could
mount the partition as something else, copy the files
from my present /home onto it, then change fstab to
reflect the desired new arrangement. Let's see...and
then wipe the present /home directory.

Or perhaps the new partition could be /opt, leaving
the present structure intact. (I have only one regular
"user," so it is not really necessary to expand /home
several fold.) Does anyone have suggestions on this subject?

Perhaps this is of general interest. Once I know the
reason why the request was made, I shall know.

Yep,
mkdir a mounting point to temporarily mount point for the partition.  Or
if it is mounted already. Make a directory in it to copy your data.  Use
something like tar -cvf - . | ( cd to/the/directory; tar -xvf - ) to
copy what's in home to it.

Then while you are logged in as root, make sure all other users are
logged out.  Move the directory to the top of that partition if it isn't
already.  Then remove the present /home directory.  Then mkdir /home,
then umount the new partition.  Then mount the new partition to home.

That's all there is to it.  Simple, Hey.

Ken

I was wanting to know hard drive usage..

For example

On my system the directory 
with large usage is 

/usr






root at libranet:/# du --max-depth=1 -h
512     ./.qt
3.3M    ./bin
133k    ./dev
14M     ./etc
20M     ./lib
512     ./mnt
512     ./opt
43k     ./tmp
648M    ./var
2.0G    ./usr
1.6M    ./boot
46M     ./home
du: `./proc/1303/fd/4': No such file or directory
19k     ./proc
3.7M    ./sbin
170k    ./root
512     ./cdrom
512     ./.mozilla
512     ./cdrom1
512     ./floppy
512     ./initrd
2.7G    .



I think you didn't do your 

du --max-depth=1 -h from the ROOT /  directory
but, your home  directory

Can you do it again??

This make any sense to you???

This does seem to be of "general" interest. Anyhow,
it's good to know how to find out the usage of various
directories.

The very large allocation to /mnt probably reflects
the fact that the Windows partition is mounted when
the system boots. But what about 28G to "."? That's
about the space on the second hd not allotted to this
Linux distribution. 

I, too, am a /usr user. These are the binaries in the
execution path available system-wide, right? Not
surprising.

I'd be interested in advice on HD partition structure
based on the figures below. I suppose it might
indicate that separate partitions were advisable for
/usr and /home.

root at psyche /]# du --max-depth=1 -h
16K     ./lost+found
428K    ./dev
du: `./proc/1983/fd/4': No such file or directory
129M    ./proc
56M     ./var
1.5M    ./tmp
13M     ./etc

244M    ./opt
12M     ./sbin

12K     ./export
1.4M    ./graphics
28G     .

I've been looking around and haven't found any sets of RPMs with a clear 
upgrade path for Redhat Linux 8.0.  Is Gnome 2.2 still to much of a 
developers release?
   Seems to me from my reading that 2.2 might cure/fix some of the issues 
I have with the stock RHL 8.0 install.

You can basically do anything you want with your Linux partitions and
mount points if you keep the permissions and ownerships intact with a
"tar cvzf <dir>" or something to that effect then mount the new drive at
the point where you want to place it.  Just take into consideration how
many users you have, if that is going to be growing and if their disk
usage will expand, if you're using quota or not and if you're going to
be installing new software.  If you've got your system to the point
where you got all your software installed that you're going to use, and
you just have users at that point to worry about, I'd just upgrade the
amount of space the /home was using.  On my servers I store all web
sites and users under /home/web and /home/users so that it's nice and
clean and when I have to I just pop in more space.  My drive layout is
big enough so that I haven't had to do that yet but it will be pretty
easy to when I have to.

Message-ID: <200303171213.19189.pluglist@bratgrrl.com>

I'm trying to figure out a way to block outgoing email generated by a virus. 
The idea is to stop it before it gets out into the world, and log the 
activity for when the admin arrives to work refreshed and alert after an 
unbroken night's sleep. 

I don't even know if it's possible, anyone have any brilliant ideas? The usual 
virus-scanners check both incoming and outgoing mail, I'm looking for a way 
to do it with iptables rules or procmail something similar. Don't even let it 
past the firewall. Seems like there ought to be something to base a generic 
ruleset on.

Do you specifically NOT want to check incoming mail?  I think you can do
this with amavisd-new, by specifying everyone in the virus_lovers*
lists.  See http://nakedape.cc/products/hardware/servers/maildefender
for some info on the setup.

I think this is a pretty good reason why LVM is so cool. I haven't used EVM but
would imagine the same functionality is there, if that is more appropriate to
your install.

Hi Wil,

Well, I think it would be rather nuts to not virus-scan incoming mail. ;-) 
Heck, I'm still seeing damned Klez a lot. I was trying to figure out a way to 
stop outgoing mail generated by an email virus, should it get past the virus 
scanner. All kinds of nice egress rules can be written to foil IP spoofing, 
spyware phoning home, and other nasties. So I'm hunting for something similar 
for outgoing email sent by viruses. But I'm stuck on what to filter on. 

Thanks for the link, I'll have a look.

You can't well block outgoing viruses with iptables unless you write
some code to capture and reconstruct smtp packets, then scan the
reconstructed mail for viruses... 

I thought procmail was for local mail delivery?

Use AMaViS.  I'm pretty sure you can specify you don't want it scanning
incoming email (but why not?).  If you're working for a nonprofit
organization, you can use it in conjunction with F-Prot for free. 
Otherwise, you might need to buy some AV software.

Whenever a virus-ridden email comes through my server, incoming or
outgoing, everybody involved is notified.  The sender is emailed saying
they sent a virus, the recipient is notified saying somebody tried to
send them a virus (and as a result, the email wasn't delivered), and the
postmaster is notified, saying somebody tried to send a virus through my
system.

Are you talking about the nasties that talk smtp themselves rather than
relying on your lookOut Express installation?

If you're running AMaViS, could you just run a filter directing all
outgoing port 25 connections back to your own mail server?  That's what
AOL does (although without the AMaViS part).  

$IPTABLES -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $INTIF -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT \
--to-port 4080

is what I use for my transparent http proxy... but I don't know if you
can direct --dport 25 back to --to-port 25 or if that would give you a
loop.

Message-ID: <3E765B09.5080403@freegeek.org>

If I power on my SCSI scanner before I power on the computer, when linux 
comes up, the scanner is detected. If I leave the scanner off until 
after the SCSI card is detected, then the scanner isn't detected and not 
available later on.

I'm wondering if there's a way to disconnect one scanner, connect a 
different one, and have the second scanner get detected, without 
powering down the system? Or at least to detect the scanner without 
power cycling?

I'm running debian woody, kernel 2.4.something (in case it matters).

I think the best upgrade path for 8.0 from Gnome 2.0 to 2.2 will be the
8.1 release. There are things like 
Garnome  (http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/garnome/)
that can build you a cutting edge 2.2 based setup but if you are looking
to stick with Redhat stable rpm's and their install base upgrading to
8.1 will probably be the easiest.

I've found the Upgrade process to perform very well especially if you
stay close to the current packages from RH.

Be aware the new celerons aren't old celerons... like P3 to P4.  So if
you buy a new board, planning on using your current celeron chip, you're
out of luck.

More stringent cooling requirements?  Have you *seen* a P4 heatsink?

If you put a large fan on an Athlon heatsink, it gets real quiet, like
you get with anything else.

If you want a real quiet system, check out watercooling.  Cool your
whole system with one 120mm fan.  :-)

I know there is, you have to tell the kernel to rescan the 
SCSI bus. For the life of me I can't remember how to do it 
though. It's not hard, I put it in a shell script, so you 
know it was easy.

P4 compatible Celeron? I thought the Celeron was a PIII with half the L2 
cache disabled/removed.

The P4 is a different formfactor entirely, and has a heatsink that's about 
10 times as big as an Athlon. This probably explains why most of them are 
quiet. Bigger fan = same airflow w/less rpms.

Yes -- but it works best if your system files (/, /tmp, /usr, and 
/var) aren't being served from a SCSI device.

The easy case is when your hard drive is IDE and only your scanner is 
SCSI. In that case, just rmmod the all the SCSI-ish kernel modules and 
then modprobe the module that handles your scanner. The bus will be 
rescanned, the device will be located, and you're in like Flynn.

If your hard drives are being served via the same scsi module, then 
you're in for a rougher go. I suggest power cycling in that case.

I tell my kernel that the scanner is connected using:

echo "scsi add-single-device 0 0 6 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi

My scanner is SCSI ID 6.

I tell my kernel that the scanner is disconnected using:

echo "scsi remove-single-device 0 0 6 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi

I'm not sure that you can connect a different type of scanner.  I'm 
also not sure about hot-plugging SCSI.  YMMV....

I thought the new Celerons were P4 Celerons.

Yeah,  just checked... they are.  They're listed as:

For most SCSI devices hot-plugging is a big no-no, however, there are a
number of bus drivers that use the scsi subsystem for which hot plugging
is perfectly acceptable (IEEE1394 comes immediately to mind). 
Unfortunately, in 2.4.x, (I don't know about 2.5) the SCSI subsystem
doesn't really understand hot-plugging and as such, you need to use the
"add-single-device" and "remove-single-device" hacks to "hot plug" these
devices.

Why not block all host machines from using any destination port 25 except the
configured SMTP host for the network? Logging the denied connection and having
a log analyzer pick up the alert could easily fit your alarm requirement. I
think this might be a better solution than port forwarding and relying on the
SMTP server to identify an infected host. I would think that host / IP
information of the infected box could be lost in forwarding. 

Thank you
Russell

I've been told by folks at two computer shops that within the last 
4-6 months Intel introduced a P4 form factor Celeron.  The idea is 
the same as before, offering a cheaper stripped down version of their 
flagship CPU.

Ah, so they are faster, and still have most of their cache removed, making 
them slow again. :/

I knew there was a reason I used Athlons with big fans. :)

For reference, I have four computers in my computer den. An 2000+ Athlon XP 
with the stock fan, a 1ghz Athlon with a Thermaltake 6 fan, a PII with the 
stock fan, and a Pentium 200 with some generic heatsink/fan on it. The PII 
is by far the loudest, but it's not because of the processor fan. The power 
supply and the front fan(s), being on the outside walls of the case, 
determine much more as to how loud a particular configuration is.

Yup.  I know about prevalent sources of noise inside a computer.

Message-ID: <86vfyh4i87.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

Our office is closing and we are moving operations to respective homes
in the next couple weeks.  The Windows machines are going to my bosses
house, who just got broadband.  He's been doing dialup for his
"upstairs" home box.  Naturally, he'd like to be networked in to the
broadband connection so he can ditch the dialup, but it is an older
house (plaster walls, etc) and wiring is going to be a problem.  I
just happened across the March 2003 IEEE Spectrum, which features some
GigaFast HomePlug ethernet bridges, which aren't dirt cheap
($85/each), but which might allow us to avoid pulling cat5 up the side
of the house or setting up WiFi.

HomePlug seems to be some kind of "standard" these days.  Does anyone
on the list have experience with this stuff, and willing to share?

I've got 8.0 installed but I haven't got all the errata and security 
applied.  Still I've also found the upgrade path is good and mostly easy.

Real soon now.

It looks VERY nice, but there are a couple of nasty gotchas.

It uses the new nptl threading library backported from 2.5.  This causes 
the nVIDIA OpenGL drivers no end of hurt.  The kernel driver does not 
compile.  If you patch it to where it will compile, the GL conflicts with 
register usage hangs your system.

Other than that...

Message-ID: <88FA49DAE6B6D611AD740002A5072D3C03CCBE18@orsmsx111.jf.intel.com>

On the client side, have you messed-around with various settings of the FTP
program? Binary mode is your friend. There may be something with different
parity/word length or escape/EOF codes that's hanging you up.

Have you tried copying the file internally on the AS400 and then
transferring the copied file rather than the original? If the problem is all
on the AS400 side, doing this should either give more errors to tell you
that AS400 is having trouble with the file, or perhaps it will allow the
transfer to complete. (If you've got different volumes, try copying to a
different volume.)

Have you tried compressing the file and transferring the compressed version
instead? This may help if you only have a clean connection for a narrow time
window. The ability to compress the file on the server side will also
indicate a reasonably clean filesystem up there.

Of course, these suggestions are only really practical for one-shot
transfers. If you've got to transfer stuff routinely, you'll need to find a
root-cause of the problem and correct it.

That was my point..

Most installs rely heavily on /usr <my experince> for

Subject: [PLUG] Sound recording w/ SB-Live! and gramofile
Message-ID: <3E776EA4.77BD8E7E@attbi.com>

Many months ago I set up and had working a way to record LP's through a
SB-Live! card using gramofile on my RH 7.0 system (200 Mhz MMX Pentium).
Last year when the RH truck visited our clinic I tried upgrading to RH
8.0. Unfortunately, I was unable to resolve a problem with latency. My
guess is that 200 Mhz is just too slow to be able to handle RH 8.0 and
play sound cleanly. So, I reinstalled RH 7.0. Then, I got busy with
other things. Now I'm trying to start recording again, but can't get
some of the stuff to work.

I can successfully run mpg123 and play an .mp3 file, so I know that the
sound card and the connection to the stereo work.

What isn't working is the connection from the stereo to the sound card.
Or maybe something is set wrong in the mixer. At any rate, when I try to
record, there is no signal. I have the cables connected thusly:

Sound Blaster Connectors

Digital Out                 Stereo
Line In ------------------- Tape A Record
Mic In
Line Out ------------------ Tape B Play
Rear Out

With the stereo knob set to "Play Tape B" I get sound when I run mpg123,
but when I try to "Play a sound file" with gramofile, it appears that
nothing happens when I tab over and hit the "Play" button. When I hit
enter repeatedly, I can see some text flashing at the top of the window,
but it goes by too fast to be able to read it.

I'm guessing that I have something set wrong somewhere, but don't know
where to look.

Ideas? Thanks.

Details below (from http://www.samba.org <http://www.samba.org> ) :

 

*	(14th Mar, 2003) Security Release - Samba 2.2.8 

A flaw has been detected in the Samba main smbd code which could allow an
external attacker to remotely and anonymously gain Super User (root)
privileges on a server running a Samba server. This flaw exists in previous
versions of Samba from 2.0.x to 2.2.7a inclusive. This is a serious problem
and all sites should either upgrade to Samba 2.2.8 immediately or prohibit
access to TCP ports 139 and 445. The Release Notes
<http://us1.samba.org/samba/whatsnew/samba-2.2.8.html>  are available
on-line.

In addition to addressing this security issue, Samba 2.2.8 includes many
unrelated improvements. These improvements result from our process of
continuous quality assurance and code review, and are part of the Samba
team's committment to excellence.

The source tarballs are available in both gzip
<http://us1.samba.org/samba/ftp/samba-2.2.8.tar.gz>  format and bzip2
<http://us1.samba.org/samba/ftp/samba-2.2.8.tar.bz2>  format. The

Try running aumix to see how the levels are set. For recording your
"igain"  should be above 0 and the "line" level should have an R next to it
indicating that it is the place to record from.  Also if you have sox
installed, you can use the utility rec to record.
For listening, the default volume and pcm levels are often 0  on boot and 
must be increased to hear anything.

Progress, thanks. I was unaware of aumix. I've only seen the GUI mixer,
and it looked to be set correctly. Apparently, it was not.

The level for Line was indeed 0, and when I raised it, sound passed from
the stereo, to the sound card, and back to the stereo. It appears that
both the Line and Digital2 controls need to be adjusted. If either of
them moves, the level changes. There is an "R" next to Line, but not
next to Digital 2.

However, there still seem to be problems with gramofile. If I try to
play a .wav file, it acts like it did it and it's done in a flash. If I
try to record, it acts in a similar manner.

I tried reading the man file for sox, but didn't make sense of it. I'm
guessing, but is this partly correct?

  sox /dev/audio out.wav -t .wav -r 44100 -c 2

I couldn't figure out how to tell sox when to stop recording. Also, sox
reported that the effect -t is not known. Is there a helpful howto for
recording with sox, one that gives examples?

  To close this thread I wish to publicly thank those who pointed me at a
defective toner cartridge. That was it. When I looked on the roller there I
coul see a smudge line about 1 cm from the right-hand side. Thus the smudges
on the paper.

  I put in a different cartridge and the problem's gone.

  Thanks for the lesson, all!

Subject: [PLUG] Color matching with OpenOffice.org
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0303181447490.2188-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I have a set of color, digital photos that are part of a project report.
They are laid out, three to a page, in OpenOffice.org-1.0.2 and printed with
the Easy Software PrintPro-4.2 drivers to the HP DeskJet 2500C on glossy,
photo paper.

  On the monitor the photos have the proper brightness to display well.
However, when I print them, the colors fade so each image is much lighter
than on the display. If I print one of these images via The GIMP, it's
slightly lighter than on the monitor but not as thin as when OO.o prints it.

  Have any of you encountered this? It's too late for this project (as I
won't print another 142 pages in color just to make them prettier), but I'd
like to do better the next time.

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] odd ping problem
Message-ID: <20030318161709.A25088@patch.com>

Odd ping problem here involving hosts on the same network. 

If I ping by IP address I get 100% response.
If I ping by hostname response drops to 17%.
Why the difference?  ping doesn't care about hostnames.

In any case name resolution is occuring.  So what's going on?

If you want to record from someting plugged into audio in (not mic)
then the R should be next to line. As far as I know you can't set
more than one device for record.

you have the options after the output file, and they should be before it
as in
sox   -t ossdsp -w -s -r 44100 -c 2 /dev/dsp out.wav

I wouldn't  use sox directly, but instead use rec which calls sox
 
rec -t wav -r 44100 -s w -c 2  out.wav 

for more information, man rec

> I couldn't figure out how to tell sox when to stop recording.

You can hit ctrl-c when you are done recording, or if you 
want to do timed recording you can use a little script 
like this

#!/bin/bash
#first use aumix to set the line levels where you want them
aumix  -v 0 -w 0 -m 0 -l R -l 0  -i 30
#then use at to kill the recorder at some later time
at now +5 minutes << EOT
killall sox
EOT
# then start rec
rec -t wav -r 44100 -s w -c 2  /tmp/out.wav  &

I find it a bit tricky to set the gain when recording from LPs
If you set the gain too high you clip the sound, if you set it
too low you don't get the full dynamic range of the recording.
You can record an example clip from the cd and then use sox
to see if you have the gain correct.

sox out.wav -e stat

will give you some statistics on the recording

Note the minimum and maximum amplitude. If they are almost
equal 1 you have the gain too high. If they are too far from 
1 say 0.5 or less, you have the gain too low.

If you have a password for webmin that is different then your unix
password you can go to the conf directory.  On my system it is /etc/webmin

open up the webmin.users file and remove the second entry between the :
for that user and replace it with an 'x'.  This will make it use Unix
authenication.  If you do this for the root user you could then log in
with the root user then change the password schema back to anything you
like.

I just tried it and it worked for me.

You may need to restart your webmin server but that is also in the
/etc/webmin directory also.  Or it is for me.

Subject: [PLUG] Should XFree86 work with Radeon 7500?
Message-ID: <20030318210002.G271@grond.sourballs.org>

I had a painful experience trying to upgrade my X server this past
weekend, and was wondering if anyone had any insights.

I was running XFree86 v4.2 on a system with an ATI Radeon 7500 without
problems, and decided to upgrade to 4.3 once I noticed the new ports
available. (As a side note here, I should mention that I'm using FreeBSD
(4.6), which has a package management system - the 'ports' system - that
allows the user to download and compile new software from source.  This is
the standard way to upgrade software on FreeBSD.)

The upgrade process ran without a hitch, machine continued to work ok,
then Sunday morning I restarted the X server ('startx', the way I always
do).  Server messages begin, then the machine becomes competely
unresponsive - can't Ctrl-C, can't switch consoles, can't even ping the
bloody thing.  Can't Ctrl-Alt-Delete -- have to push the start button to
reboot the machine.  After rebooting, the end of the X log looks like:

 (WW) RADEON(0): Video BIOS not detected, using default PLL parameters!
 (II) RADEON(0): PLL parameters: rf=2700 rd=67 min=12500 max=35000;
xclk=16615
 (==) RADEON(0): Using gamma correction (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)

 (WW) RADEON(0): Mode 1024x768 is out of range.

 (II) Unloading /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/drivers/radeon_drv.o
 (EE) Screen(s) found, but none have a usable configuration.
 Fatal server error:
 no screens found


In previous server logs (from 4.2), the Video BIOS *is* detected, and
many lines of monitor and screen info follow.

Tried reconfiguring with XFree86 -configure, and that hangs the machine
too. Searching the system logs shows that a kernel panic occurs about
here.

Reinstalling 4.2 fixed the problem.

So I'm wondering - since 4.2 *found* my card's video BIOS, and 4.3
*doesn't find* my card's video BIOS, is the problem likely to be a bug in
4.3?  It's possible FreeBSD's package mechanism is at fault here, but
that seems unlikely to me, as the software builds and installs OK. I've
Googled in vain on this topic.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?

Was this a refurbished cartridge or a factory one?  

For the Laser printers, I have had nothing but problems with the
refurbished cartridges.  I think is has to do with the amount of
physical wear the parts get the first time around. (I usually go through
about a case of paper per toner cartridge.)

In this case, the extra cost is worth it.  Not certain about ink jets.

  Someone else suggested this earlier. My response then, as now, is that
I've been buying from a local rebuild company since 1993 (first for my
LaserJet 4L and since 1995 for the LaserJet 5). I've no idea how many
cartridges I've consumed in the decade, but this is the first one with any
sort of problem. And I do a lot of printing. Just today I did 180 pages for
report copies, plus 142 color pages on the DeskJet 2500C.

  The local company has been extremely reliable and responsive to my needs.
I'll let them know about this one problem.

Generally, yes.  I have a 7500 that works just fine with Red Hat Linux
7.3.  However, it does rely on an AGP kernel module.  Perhaps you need
something like that for FreeBSD?  Didn't I read on Slashdot in the last
couple of days was being to delayed until it could be made to work with
XFree 4.3?

Hm, if it's not supported by the kernel, there's probably nothing you
can do, except turn off modversions and compile your module w/o
modversions.  That /might/ work.  What kind of NIC is it that's not
supported?  Those are pretty rare these days.

I've the same symptoms with nvidia card when 3d is enabled. I can use the

not FreeBSD.

Let me guess, you're using the binary nvidia drivers too?  That's a
common complaint; happened to me all the time until the card finally
gave up and I replaced it with an ATI.   (Well, it stopped when I
stopped using their binary drivers, but then I had no 3D, which I didn't
really need anyway.)

Which AGP are you using? There is the kernel AGP, and the nVidia driver's
NvAGP. The nVidia driver does not like the kernel AGP, if you've built
your own kernel disable AGP support (this will only effect the kernel's
implementation, not the nVidia one), if you're using a prebuilt kernel
either remove the AGP module or tell the nVidia driver to disable AGP
altogether.

Unless a data structure used by the driver changes between kernel versions,
I think the driver should still be useable.  Perhaps the problem is that
depmod doesn't find the module after a kernel upgrade.  Where is
the module installed?  If it is installed under
/lib/modules/`kernelversion`/, try putting it under /lib/modules/
instead.

Subject: [PLUG] Slackware 9.0 and Java
Message-ID: <1048092748.7912.14.camel@duron.stpaultel.com>

Slackware 9.0 was released yesterday, and some unofficial ISOs are
available on ftp.kpn.be (which, for the first time ever, is actually
maxing out bandwidth and FTP connections).

If you want to download Slackware, don't hit ftp.slackware.com - use a
mirror.  Leave that server for mirrors to sync with.

Now, Slackware 9.0 was compiled primarily with GCC 3.2.x.  This
introduces incompatabilities with binaries built with GCC 2.95. 
Including Sun's Java.  Redhat and others have dealt with this by just
compiling Mozilla with GCC <3.2.x.  Slackware didn't do that... the
advantages of compiling Moz with 3.2 are just too great... it really
does run faster.

According to Gentoo, Blackdown's latest Java builds were put together
with GCC 3.2.  So, while I haven't tested it, you should be able to just
drop Blackdown Java in there and it'll work with Mozilla.  The other
options, if you want Java in your browser, are to use Netscape or
Konqueror... or to compile it yourself (which is what I did in Gentoo).

Happy Slackin'  :-)

FYI, this is *not* the case with the recently released Mozilla 1.3
RedHat RPMS (nor the current CVS snapshot RPMS).  These are compiled
with GCC 3.2, meaning the current j2re and j2sdk RPMS from Sun *will not
work* you need to either install the Blackdown binaries, or wait for Sun
to release new RPMS. (Or compile it yourself)

This sounds like a race condition involving timeouts.
The name lookup is probably taking a variable amount of time
and is close to the timeouts on the systems.
Anyway, that's where I'd start looking.

I think I read that somewhere, then it slipped out of my head...  :-)

I don't think Moz 1.3 even compiles properly with GCC 2.9x any more...

one large one that is now reiserfs. This partition is
at the end of the drive. If this is done using parted,
I suppose I need to remove this partition, create two
.ext2 partitions in the resulting free space, and use
tune2fs -j /dev/hdxx to create the journal. Is this
indeed the correct approach?

Message-ID: <1048100492.5052.36.camel@red>

Speaking of Slackware, I'm using 8.1, which includes
Matt Dillon's crond instead of Vixie cron. I want to
use the crontabs in /var/spool/cron/crontabs instead
of the cron directories below /etc. However, when I
make a change to a crontab, crond doesn't recognize
the change. Sending crond a HUP doesn't help. The
man page doesn't mention anything about this. I must
have forgotten something. Help.

On my 8.1 box, it uses the crontabs in /var/spool/cron/crontabs.. the
stuff in /etc is just the run daily, weekly, monthly stuff (and has
corresponding entries in root's crontab).

And cron checks the crontabs at the top of each minute for changes....

Are you sure you have crond running?  I'd do a ps -aux | grep cron to be
sure it is there.

Hmmm... can you show me what your crontabs look like?  For instance:

# cat /var/spool/cron/crontabs/rob
59 19 * * tue /home/rob/shows/tue
59 19 * * wed /home/rob/shows/wed
59 19 * * sun /home/rob/shows/sun

(yes, I realize I could turn that in to a single cron job)

Maybe you should crank up debugging, logging, and have it run in the
forground ... hmmm... a typo.. crond --help calls it the fordeground.

See if it is erroring out with anything.

I just stopped and started crond and it appears to be
working now. Weird.

That is peculiar.  I don't ever remember hearing about cron not noticing
changes like what you described.  Maybe we should chalk it up to a
one-in-a-million bug?

Slightly off topic but it does tie back to Linux.

I'm stuck working on a bunch of IIS/Frontpage/Win2K pages that were 
developed by less than optimal designers. The site consist of a rather 
interesting combination of asp, html, perl and windows programs.  And the 
mess is not documented at all.

I'm sure I've seen programs designed to trace the flow/layout of a web 
site but I can't remember what they were called.  A google search will 
happen tonight but if anyone can offer a pointer of two before then I'd 
appreciate it.

I have a network device that supports sending logs to a syslog server. 
I'm successfully logging from this device, but I'd like these logs to go

I don't see any obvious way using syslog.conf...

Change the facility that the device logs to and write the logs for that
facility to a file.  Your syslog.conf will then have entries something like:

local0.*                                                -/var/log/local0.log
local1.*                                                -/var/log/devlog
local2.*                                                -/var/log/seartrs.log
local3.*                                                -/var/log/vpn.log
local4.*                                                -/var/log/pix.log
local4.=info                                            |/var/log/pix/info
local5.*                                                -/var/log/5399.log
local6.*                                                -/var/log/routers.log

How the "network device" is configured to support a different facility depends
on how the manufacturer designed it.

It's a broadcom ethernet on board my ASUS P4PE board.


It also has an onboard sound card that doesn't work.  Linux finds it but
no sound comes out.  I tried installing ALSA but the instruction were
not complete and it didn't work.

Did you go to the www.ati.com site and get its driver for Linux?  You
might have to recompile it for the 4.3 XFree86.

So I bought this IBM monitor off ebay.  It has coloration in a couple
of the corners.  The guy refunded my money and didn't want me to ship it
back to him.

So I offer it to anyone who wants to pick it up.  First come first
served.

It is an IBM 21" P202.  1600x1200 max res.  Has two inputs on the back,
one HD15 and one 13W3 (old Sun connector?).  Black enclosure.

Email me if you want it.  It would be worth paying someone to fix it.
It could be a really nice monitor.  I have an additional 21" (IBM P260)
and am quite pleased with it.

If you do not get a reply, it has been spoken for.  I don't want to
reply to 50 people stating it has been hauled away.

If you don't want it after rreading this, consider it spoken for.

Judging fromt he photos it's been magnetized. Somebody here recently gave 
instructions for degaussing them with a powerful magnet. It tooks about a minute, 
but worth the time.

SAMBA URGES USERS TO UPGRADE AFTER FLAW REVEALED
     (Source: Network World Fusion) The developers of the
open-source Samba file server product are urging users to upgrade
to the latest 2.2.8 stable version of Samba after discovering a
potentially critical flaw in earlier versions.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742052

ENTERPRISES GETTING STARTED WITH LINUX
     (Source: Computerworld) Not every IT shop is on the leading
edge of Linux; many are just starting to explore the open-source
phenomenon. For them, Linux's practical implications are a major
concern. IT managers face day-to-day challenges such as how to
perform version control, how to back up and restore data, and how
much training their staffs need.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742053

QUIET PROTEST MARKS OPEN SOURCE EVENT
     (Source: PC World.com) Free software advocates protesting
the decision to include Microsoft at an open source and
government conference showed up in American Revolutionary War
uniforms and passed out a few flyers Monday but otherwise didn't
cause much of a ruckus.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742054

HOW YOUR CAREER CAN THRIVE WITH LINUX
     (Source: Computerworld) For systems administrators, it means
they'll have another operating system to learn as their companies
capitalize on Linux savings by retraining staffers. Programmers
and developers may be called on to port Unix-based applications
to Linux systems or to write new ones. They won't need to learn
new languages.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742055

OPEN SOURCE GETS BOOSTER PROGRAM
     (Source: PC World.com) A think tank advocating the use of
open source software in government is launching a source-code
escrow program that would let vendors make money on proprietary
software while eventually releasing their products to the open
source community. At least one software company says it may be
open to the idea.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742056

AN OPEN SOURCE PLAN FOR CIOS
     (Source: CIO) Once a toy for geeks, open source is slowly
but surely filtering into the enterprise and transforming the way
software is designed, sold and supported. And any CIO without an
open-source strategy in 2003 will be paying too much for IT in
2004.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742057

LINUX MEANS MORE OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR RETRAINING
     (Source: Computerworld) For the IT professional, the ease of
learning Linux has drawbacks. Instead of creating jobs in a
still-slow employment climate, it appears that Linux is enabling
companies to fairly quickly retrain existing personnel in the
operating system.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742058

OPEN SOURCE TO BLAME FOR JOBS EXODUS?
     (Source: InfoWorld.com) Programmers need to innovate and
specialize. If your skills are mundane and you simply code to
specification, you might find yourself working in a toll booth.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742059

HP TO IMPROVE RED HAT SERVICE, SUPPORT WORLDWIDE
     (Source: ITworld.com) Hewlett-Packard announced Wednesday it
is strengthening the services it provides to buyers of HP servers
and workstations that run on Red Hat Inc.'s Linux operating
systems.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742060

APPLE ANNOUNCES XSERVE DESIGNED FOR CLUSTERS
     (Source: Network World Fusion) The new XServe is a
stripped-down version of the regular XServe, designed for
applications that don't require as much file-server capability,
such as Web serving.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742061

RED HAT UNVEILS SMALLER SIBLING
     (Source: Network World Fusion) Red Hat last week introduced
updates to its enterprise server and workstation operating system
products with the release of Red Hat Enterprise ES and Red Hat
Enterprise WS.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742062

MORE THAN 500,000 US TECH JOBS LOST IN TWO YEARS
     (Source: InfoWorld.com) The American Electronics Association
(AeA) has put a number on the job losses suffered by high-tech
workers over the last two years, reporting that about 560,000
jobs have been lost from the height of the dot-com era.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742063

LATEST WINDOWS 2000 PATCH CAN LOCK SYSTEM
     (Source: Computerworld) A software patch that fixes a
serious security vulnerability in Windows 2000 can cause systems
running the operating system to fail, Microsoft said yesterday.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742064

US ARMY HACKED WITH IIS VULNERABILITY, WORM EXPECTED SOON
     (Source: ITworld.com) A March 10 computer attack on a server
run by the U.S. Army using the recently disclosed Microsoft
Internet Information Server (IIS) vulnerability resulted in the
complete compromise of that machine and may herald the advent of
a new worm in the very near future.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742065

LINUX AT NASCAR.COM: IT'S THE PITS
     (Source: LinuxWorld.com) In monitoring his son-in-law's
performance in the Busch Series, Joe Barr discovers that
NASCAR.com is packed with great information and features for
racing fans. Unfortunately for Linux and Macintosh users, the
site's most-exciting feature is rigged to work only with RealOne
and a Windows PC. Joe explores the reasons why.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742066

DEBUNKING THE LINUX-WINDOWS MARKET-SHARE MYTH
     (Source: LinuxWorld.com) There are dozens of reasons why
people have underestimated how quickly Linux has been grabbing
Windows' market share. Windows starts out with a false boost and
maintains its illusory market share even as it gets replaced by
Linux. In 2004, don't be surprised when Linux overtakes Windows
to become the main focus for developers.
http://www.linuxworld.com/go.cgi?id=742067

ANALYSIS: SCO'S CASE AGAINST IBM STANDS ON SHAKY GROUND
     (Source: LinuxWorld.com) We put a microscope to SCO's
complaint and find logical leaps, factual gaffes and a heap of
trouble for IBM if SCO's main contention is true.

Check the CD that came with the motherboard, there is a .src.rpm and a
tar ball on there with the kernel module for the broadcom ethernet
card.  Compile and install it, and it should work like a charm.

Hi all,

I'm having a problem with some people not being able to resolve a server
name in a zone that is being hosted by my DNS server.

I'm having a hard time understanding this, and would like the fine
members on this list to try something for me.  What it boils down to, is
that these same people that can't resolve www.infotects.com can resolve
mail.infotects.com.  These two server names are defined in the same zone
file, and both DNS servers have the same information in that zones.

Please try to go to www.infotects.com, if you can make, please let me
know, and the ISP you are using.  If you don't resolve it, will you do
me a HUGE favor and run dig on that name?  Then send the information and
the ISP you are using to me.  This information will be kept
confidential.

TIA,

Derek Loree

Just add in iptables rules to block out the servers... maybe ports 6666
and 6667 for IRC.

Yahoo's server can be found if you fire up gaim and check its settings. 
I think MSN Messenger uses messenger.msn.com, but don't quote me on
that.  Figure out what it currently resolves to then block it... if you
have DNS running, block it there...

I believe either of these will tell you:

man ifconfig
man ifdown

Google may do it as well..

ifdown eth2 
 will stop that interface, but you will have to modify a config file
to do it permanently. check google for you question with your
distribution to find out. It should be pretty easy to do.. Or just
disable it through the same interface you enabled it.

  Isn't it nice to know that the one remaining cable company is so arrogant
and inconsiderate? I have not before encountered an ISP that refused a spam
report that was e-mailed to their abuse address.

procmail is your friend.
This is the kind of thing that procmail excels at.

a rule like:

:0:
* ^From: .*nastyplace_I_do_not_like.ext
/dev/null

will do what you . . . well maybe not.  You want to block mail not just
trash it.

Dirk,

  It is if you're running your own MTA. With postfix I have two separate
files that are checked for each incoming message: one contains IP addresses
the other contains domain names. I duplicate some of the domain names in the
header_checks file when spammers direct their junk to my secondary MX so the
topmost header is from that server rather than the sending ISP.

IRC listens on various ports. Some common ones are 5000, 6000, 6660 - 6669, 
and 7000. There are others, based on what network you are connecting to, 
and the port they've adopted to use.

I have argued that with our security people.  I told them that a web form 
wasn't the way to go.  Unfortunately the rise in spam and RIAA/MPAA abuse 
complaints (all automated) and must be investigated manually is overwhelming 
our company's ability to keep up.

Rich send me the email.  If it originated within our network in the NW I will 
make sure it's addressed.

I did notice a couple of minor problems, but nothing that would set the

Sean,

  I don't think the folks who make those decisions have any idea the bother
it is -- and the time it takes -- to cut and paste from a text editor into
their little boxes on a Web page. It's only a minute to identify the sending
ISP and forward the message with my canned statement.

  Unfortunately, "customer service" has once again retreated to a phrase in
advertising and not a reality of doing business.

That must be a dirty screen.  I've found simply using a clean cotton
cloth with a small amount of windex (or something similar) sprayed on
the cloth itself to work very well.  FWIW, spraying solvents directly on
the LCD is known to be somewhat dangerous, not so much for the screen
itself, but if the cleaner runs off the edge of the screen surface it
can damage Important Parts (tm).

How 'bout lens cleaner?  Dampen the cloth instead of wetting the screen.

I now have a hard disk with vfat in the first primary
(only) partition and the rest of the disk blank.I
would like to put four Linux partitions on the space
that is now blank. 

Is parted or fdisk a better choice for doing this? In
either case it looks as if I have to specify whether
the new partitions are primary or logical. So far as I
can tell, they might as well all be logical. There
will be fewer than 12 partitions altogether on this
disk, and Linux doesn't care about the type.

Do "extended" partitions always need to have a flag?
All the ones I have seen thus far do.

It's also a violation of RFC 2142 (ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2142.txt).

Actually, if you shop around, you can find some that don't. Lot's of people 
don't want "extra" chemicals near their kids.

And since baby wipes are such a large market, it's a really cuts the cost.

  By golly, Chuck, you're right! Providing customer service _is_ a violation
of an Internet standard. Now I understand.

  In any case, it's the face of the unit we want to clean, not the bottom.

Use fdisk, since you're starting from scratch. You won't have to label 
anything, just tell fdisk the type of partitions you want to create.

Subject: [PLUG] Color printing from acroread
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0303211550001.15083-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I downloaded a color relief map of Iraq as a pdf file and I want to print
a hard copy on my HP DeskJet 2500C.

  In acroread, I select "page setup" and make the paper size "ledger"
(13x17") and portrait orientation. Then I specify the printer (via CUPS) as
'lpr -Pcolor'.

  The printer asks me to load letter size paper in the manual feed tray; the
ledger paper is in tray 3. After much squeaking, out comes a grey scale map
in the upper, right quadrant of the 8.5x11" paper.

  I cannot find anything in either acroread or xpdf to specify color output.
Can anyone help me out here?

Thanks,

Rich

Just another update on this.  We are condensing heavily in preparation
for an office move.  One of the things on the chopping block is our

were fine and usually only lost 8 sectors off of those.  So, if you

I have plenty of 12 year old 5.25-inch floppies that are mostly unreadable
and I have several paper documents that are about 150 years old and
quite legible. Go with low acid paper for long term storage.

Does anyone know of an easy way to configure Mozilla to use a certain
theme for all new users?  I'd like the Orbit theme to be the default,
for example.  I've been poking around and managed to get various
preference, bookmarks, window arrangement, etc., configured for new
users, but haven't yet figured out how to apply a particular theme.
Anyone ventured this far into Mozilla?

I bought a packet of some name-brand (can't recall which) screen cloth
and a spray bottle of same-brand LCD cleaning fluid. Compared to
something simpler and more common, I probably spent too much, but
considering the total came to less than $6-7, it amounted to a
negligible percentage of my laptop's purchase price.

I find that a simple dry wipe-down gets rid of most dust and stuff. When
it gets really grimy, I break out the spray and moisten the cloth a bit.
Sometimes it takes a few applications, but it always does a good job.

For new users, it would be as easy as copying a generic .mozilla folder into /etc/skel. They would be able to change their copy, of course, but that would make your settings the default.

Everyone have any experience configuring PPTP?
If so, please help.  I'm having a great deal of trouble with this.

I haven't set up and VPN using PPTP before and don't know what I'm doing.
One of the errors I have been getting is:

On the Windows 2000 client:
   Error 778:  It was not possible to verify the identity of the server

At the same time the daemon log file on the Astaro box contains:

  Thanks, Paul. Eyeglass-cleaning spray and cloth worked like a charm.

Subject: [PLUG] Samba Setup
Message-ID: <002c01c2f0bc$76f76d80$9400a8c0@c970265a>

I have a home network with 4 computers connected to a router that is also a gateway and firewall. 3 of the machines are full time Windoze and one is a dual boot between XP and Linux. I want to configure Samba so that the Linux machine can act as a file and print server for the other 3. 

My problem - Samba wants to take over the DHCP duties from the router. In doing so it raises no end of havoc on the network with the other machines. 

Does anyone know how to make Samba "play nice" and leave the DCHP duties for the router?

Thanks in advance

Samba does not take over DHCP. DHCP is a separate daemon. Try 
ps ax | grep dhcpd | grep -v "grep" 
at the command prompt and if dhcpd is running. 

Thank you

Subject: [PLUG] "secure" mail clients
Message-ID: <8665qbrow8.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I have a number of users set up, happy and pretty much trouble-free,
with good old Eudora, using pop to get mail.  This has almost always
been over a private local network, so I haven't been too worried about
the passwords-in-the-clear problem with pop.  With the "distribution"
of computing resources with our impending office move, I am getting
more concerned.

What are the practical alternatives to pop these days?  What do your
MS-lusers use for email clients (other than, gack, Outlook) that will
support these alternatives?

Any other suggested solutions to the problem?  Maybe a VPN?  There is
a linux router at either end, so if a VPN, which one?

Thanks!

I'm almost positive the POP has an SSL plugin, at least within courier,
and I know that Eudora suports SSL.  The other option of course is SSL
IMAP.

Those would be my two sugestions, the SSL mail stuff works very well.

Yes indeed.  Any POP/IMAP service can be wrapped with SSL using stunnel,
although some have their own built-in facilities for SSL, such as Cyrus
IMAP, and almost all MUAs support it.  (I think if you use a self-signed
cert with Outlook you need to import the cert with IE, though.)  
SSL-wrapping is the most maintainable way, if you don't otherwise have a
Kerberos infrastructure.  Using the SASL facilities which use
challenge-handshake require a separate password from the usual password
databases, which makes maintenance more difficult, and keeps it in a
clear-text equivalent, which makes it a liability.

I've taken to using those Windex-wipes for cleaning monitors and such. 
I always have difficulty finding an appropriate soft, lint-free cloth. 
Usually I just cut off a small corner, or a use a whole one clean
everything in the house.  I've had one container for a year or two
that's nowhere near depleted.  I don't know if there's anything wrong
with using these things on LCDs; I've done it a couple times and haven't
seen any problems.

And if you really want just to archive against electronic loss, you
might use a duplex, high-DPI laser printer and print them 8-up or
higher, which should be okay for scanning and OCR retrieval (although
you'd certainly want to test it).  This would keep your costs, storage
requirements, and paper consumption down.  Anyone know how long and in
what manner laser toner deteriorates?

Subject: [PLUG] phantom printer on CUPS, cannot share printer
Message-ID: <200303221957.44762.pluglist@bratgrrl.com>

Once again, lured by the promise of "Don't worry, it's easy!" I tried to set 
up a CUPS print server on my LAN. Before launching into a long tale of woe, 
and appending endless config files and log dumps, perhaps a brief description 
of the symptoms will serve:

I can use CUPS fine with local printers on /dev/lp0, no problem at all. I have 
the official CUPS books, CUPS: Common Unix Printing System, by Michael Sweet. 
It's better as a guide for someone who wants to write printer drivers, than 
for an ole country sysadmin who just wants to print things. I edited 
cupsd.conf according to the book. CUPS then added a phantom printer, in 
addition to the local printer, naming it HP6L:

"Remote Printer on unknown        
Description: No Information Available
Location: Location Unknown
Printer State: stopped, rejecting jobs."

Cannot delete it, cannot start it, the only thing that can be done is client 
machines connect to it with the greatest of ease, even Windows. That's right, 
without Samba even. But neither linux nor windows can print to this stupid 
thing, because it's really not there.

I have tried manually editing the configs, trying the various network 
protocols, and not a blessed one of em works. I have The Official Book and 
the online docs. No answers there.

Thanks in advance for brilliant advice. ;-)

* Eudora 5.2 has overcome many of the SSL gremlins that plagued 
  previous releases.

* Mozilla works fine.

* If your folks know what they're doing, they can always use the Win32 
  port of stunnel (http://www.stunnel.org/download/binaries.html) to 
  establish the SSL connection(s) to the remote mailhost and point

Maybe even print barcode, then in 50 years you can just take your data
to a grocery store to recover it! ;-)

Anyway, my main point was just to note how well the 5-1/4" media was
holding up, which was something of a surprise.

  Just out of curiosity, have you tried the data integrity of the older, 8"
floppy disks?

I'm not sure what is involved in putting the *system* into standby, as
compared to just the monitor - Linux distros usually provide a utility
called 'hdparm' to set spin-down and sleep times for IDE drives, don't
know if theres a SCSI equivalent.  I haven't found a similar utility in
FreeBSD - possibly one of the tunables mentioned in 'man ata' or 'man
tuning' would do it, I haven't looked very hard.

I've never had an 8-inch drive, though I was in possession of some
8-inch media for a short period in the mid-1980's before I passed it
along to a geeky hacker-type at OSU, who exhibited an excessive
interest in them reminiscent of own more recent interest.  I seem to
recall that despite being physically larger, they had a capacity of
only 180K (or something similar).

Well, since you ask.

Two changes to the default cupsd.conf should enable sharing of a printer, of 
course using appropriate values for your system:

<Location />
Order Deny,Allow
Deny From All
Allow From 127.0.0.1
Allow from 192.168.1.  <--- add this line
</Location>

BrowseAddress 192.168.1.255

The docs all say to do this:  

Allow from 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.255

Adding any netmask blocks client access, and creates the phantom printer. I do 
not know why, I just know what works. The netmask on my LAN is 255.255.255.0 
TCP/IP gurus are most welcome to chime in here.

Have a static IP on the machine connected to the printer. There's a few more 
steps, the cupsd.conf entries are the big showstopper.

My first system (Z80 CP/M) had 2 of them (Shugart 801? + 2 spares) I do have 
some media, mostly term papers and silly teen agnst poetry.  Don't know if 
the drives still exist in my folk's basement, but I've never seen a Linux 
driver.  Don't think the h/w interface is the same as today's floppys either.

So the question is: Is there any practical way to run those wonders of 
yesteryear?

Ok, floppies might be a good way to save data. 
I pulled out some 5 1/4 inch floppies from 1986. There were some
programs that I had written using Turbo Pascal Version 3.01.
Not only were the programs intact, There was a copy of the compiler
on one of the floppies and I was able to compile and run the programs.
Amazing. The diskettes I said were bad, were from 1993, but I still
hold out hope even for them.

By "run" do you mean you're interested in getting the data to more
current media?  If so, I'd guess your best bet is serial communications,
such as transferring them with Xmodem.

I meant plug them into a modern pc and read data.  Brief googling indicates 
the answer is no.  The host machine has gone to Xerox 820 heaven (or the 
thrift store equivalent).  Looks like the drives required, among other 
things, 24vdc.

It was just an idle thought, pretty sure I printed out everything important 
at the time.  At least life has continued these 14 yrs since decomishioning.

I don't have time now for full instructions, but I give you a quick

I was having fun last week recovering data from the 3.5-inch floppies
that were "bad", dd'ing images off.  When I got to a bad spot on the
disk, I'd just skip past it and dd the remainder to another file, dd a
replacement using /dev/zero and then cat the files together and mount
the resulting image using the "-o loop" option and read the files
off.  The result will be that some of the files will have chunks of
zeros that really shouldn't be there, but the upside is I got the rest
of the data off.  

In one case, the missing part was the first 8 sectors, which meant
that I lost the FATs and the root directory.  However, the data were
distictive enough that I could, under the assumption that the clusters
were written in order, figure out the starting and ending sectors and
dd them out of the image and then truncate the crap off the end.

Subject: [PLUG] Games under Linux
In-Reply-To: <3F09E1E6D02D804383502AFDC4DE4EC828D4@cp01.office.wa-net.com>
Message-ID: <20030324163615.83110.qmail@web40812.mail.yahoo.com>

If you're a gamer, you might be interested to know
that the Linux client for Neverwinter Nights is
finally out. It actually won 2nd or 3rd place on the
"vaporware" awards, as it was originally supposed to
arrive when the Windows version shipped early last
Summer. I originally bought it with the expectation of
playing it on my Linux workstation.

Anyway, the client is only a beta, but I have to say
taht I was VERY impressed! I had originally got tired
of waiting and played it a little on my Win2k machine,
but was disappointed. It's an Athlon 2100+ with a
newer (though lower end) ATI video card. It ran
poorly, even at the lowest resolution and the bells
and whistles turned off. To top it off, after spending
20 minutes creating my character, the game
blue-screened about 60 seconds into the game, losing
my new character. I only played it a short time after
that, as it was jerky enough to give me a headache and
crashed a second time.

The Linux client, on the other hand, runs very
smoothly at a higher res with all the bells and
whistles, on a Celeron 1300 with an old GeForce2
running RedHat 8.0. I played it quite a bit this
weekend without a single flaw or crash.

I'm curious as to what other people have experienced
when playing a Linux port of a Windows game. Was it
faster/slower under Linux?

When I first started using Linux, I tried out Quake3,
and was getting at least 20% faster framerates on the
same hardware, and never had a crash. Unfortunately on
my latest install, Quake3 doesn't run. It loads, I
select the first map, the map loads, and locks up
about 1 second later. Any ideas?

Return to Castle Wolfenstein has run flawlessly for me
under Linux. When it first game out, I played it under
Win2k, but it had an aweful bug that would crash the
game every time I tried to load a game after dying,
which was a show-stopper. A lot of other people in
message boards had the same problem, but I have saw a
fix, even recently.

When installed under Linux (again on the same
hardware), it has run perfectly. I never did compare
frame rates, but it felt smoother under Linux.

Anyone else compared games under Linux vs. Windows?

Depending on how you have your system configured this could be the problem.  
The default is to leave 5% of you disk space free for root use when the 
filesystem gets too full.  Try moving some things to another partition


Such as

mkdir /var/opt
 
mv /opt /opthold

ln -s /var/opt /opt

cd /opthold
tar cf - . && ( cd /var/opt && tar xvf - )

Also you have a 4.8 /tmp directory.  This seems excessive.  I only make my 
500MB, and that's probably very excessive.

Also, if you've installed a significant number of debian packages you
may well have a large amount of disk space being used by cached
packages. Try running `apt-get clean` and seeing if that helps.

Disregard me previous comment about cached debian packages clogging your
hard drive. apt-get caches live under /var, and it looks like you got
more than enough space there. :-)

Root partition is getting a bit cramped, though. If I were you and had
time to kill, I'd consider swapping the root and tmp partitions. I can't
imagine you'll ever need 5 gig of tmp space.

I've heard it said that keeping the root partition towards the beginning
of the drive is best for performance (faster access of inner tracks,
supposedly). This always struck me as pointless hare-splitting.
Comments, anyone?

Message-ID: <88FA49DAE6B6D611AD740002A5072D3C03CCBE60@orsmsx111.jf.intel.com>

Want a sloppy, cheating solution that makes things work without addressing
the root cause of the problem?

 

Make sure your Samba box's DHCP scope and your router's DHCP scope are both
larger than the number of machines on your network and that they are both
within the same subnet. That way, it won't matter which DHCP server
responded first to a workstation's query. They'll both serve adequately. 

 

For example, Samba gives addresses ranging from 192.168.1.10 through
192.168.1.64 in a class C (255.255.255.0) subnet while the router gives
addresses ranging from 110 through 164 in the same subnet.

Subject: [PLUG] Samba Setup

 

I have a home network with 4 computers connected to a router that is also a
gateway and firewall. 3 of the machines are full time Windoze and one is a
dual boot between XP and Linux. I want to configure Samba so that the Linux
machine can act as a file and print server for the other 3. 

 

My problem - Samba wants to take over the DHCP duties from the router. In
doing so it raises no end of havoc on the network with the other machines. 

 

Does anyone know how to make Samba "play nice" and leave the DCHP duties for
the router?

 

Thanks in advance

I see you've already found your solution. When I was struggling with CUPS a

(where I had seen it working) and poked-around in the configuration files. 

What can I say? I'm lazy that way.

That won't necessarily work--they might NAK each others offers, even
though they don't overlap.

I don't think so, but I'm willing to admit that I've been wrong more than
once or twice before.

My theory is that a newly booted workstation will transact its DHCP business
only with THE one particular DHCP server that responds first to its DHCP
request broadcast.

If that happens to be the same DHCP server 'A' it saw last time and the
server gives it an ACK to continue using the same address as before, the
workstation agrees to Server A's re-assignment and everything's fine,
despite the other server's jabbering. If the first DHCP server to respond is
the other one 'B' and NAKs the workstation's use of an address outside its
scope, it'll counter-offer an address the workstation agrees to the new
assignment and again, everything's fine. In either case, the server's
response is directed to the workstation's physical (MAC) address and it
contains the server's MAC and IP addresses for the workstation's responses.
Once the workstation hears its first response, it is only going to transact
with the DHCP server from which it heard its FIRST response.

If two DHCP servers always fought (NAK-ing each other's assignments) over
who can assign the workstation its address, there would be no way to set-up
redundancy in DHCP servers on a subnet without some complex communications
going-on between the redundant servers.

I think I mentioned that my solution was sub-optimal in that it doesn't
address the root-cause of the original poster's problem; namely, how to
shut-off the Samba server's DHCP service so that all workstations can get
canonical addresses from the router. I'll have to learn some more Linux
before I can give that answer with any authority.

two tab stops. I want to eliminate those in one, automatic S&R operation.
Similarly, I want to replace the hard returns at the end of each line with
the citation paragraph.

Thanks,

Rich

I paid the $60 for RHN almost a year ago, and am quite pleased.  I
automatically get priority access ahead of all the deadbeats ;) that
aren't paying RHN members.

Supposedly you get faster access to the ISOs as well (and clearly earlier
access per today's post).  But despite that I still download ISOs from ftp
via limestone.uoregon.edu which is really fast.

I was in an email conversation with someone from Redhat and he said that
if you want to support RH is better economically to buy RHN subscriptions
rather than a retail copy of RH (the retailers get most of the buck for
off-the-shelf copies).

Am planning to renew my subscription when it expires.

My OO.o box is at home, so I can't check if it's identical to M$oft Word,
where one can search & replace with ^t for tabs and ^p for hard returns, ^n
for soft returns. There's a pop-up that allows insertion of these "special"

Your request would be to replace ^p^t^t with ^p

I have two demo RHN accounts and one paid subscription. I'm also quite
pleased. For me, the main advantage is notification when an update that
affects one of my systems is available, and up2date's ability to reconcile
RPM dependencies. The downside is that RH does not good a good enough job of
on their older releases (e.g. 7.3) of staying current with new packages
(e.g. mutt 1.4i). I've sometimes resorted to building them from source, and
then up2date urges me to load an older release. Guess I could build my own
rpm so that the database shows the release I'm running :)

  Thanks for the answer, Daniel. Doesn't work in OO.o. Using ctrl-t nothing
appears and nothing happens. Selecting the regex checkbox and entering \t
also does nothing.

I haven't followed Slackware numbering; it used to be a year (e.g.,

Slackware pulled an SuSE, jumping from 4.0 to 7.0 (to keep up with SuSE,
RedHat, and Mandrake).

ftp.kpn.be has a whole lot of old Slackware versions up... it goes
1.1.2, 2.0.1, 2.2.0, 2.3, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, 4.0,
7.0, 7.1, 8.0, 8.1, then 9.0 was released last week.

I think any date names (like Slackware '96) were probably a nickname
type thing.... it was before I found The Way.  :-)

Redhat will backport security patches, but they resist moving to new 
versions of packages.

I understand why.  I don't totally agree with it, but I understand it.

If you were able to have current apps, then you would not move to the new 
bright and shiny thing that they want to sell you.  (That is, after all, 
how they keep in business.)

There is also the issue of creeping dependancies.  Think of a distribution 
as a tangles web of spidery dependancies.  When you grab onto an app and 
pull, you get all the things that it is hooked to.  When you upgrade, you 
get to deal with all of the updates that program may require and any new 
dependancies that may get added or dropped.  You also get to deal with all 
the other apps that may rely on the older versions.

For something like Mutt, this may not be a big deal.  For something like 
Evolution, it might me.  For packages that are moving from Gnome 1.x to 
2.x, it gets even messier.

And, no, apt-get is not the answer here.  I can name a couple of places 
where Debian has gotten it wrong as well.  (The move from /var/spool/mail 
to /var/mail is a primary example.)

It is a hard problem.  Redhat solves it by not upgrading except in large  
distribution-sized chunks.  Debian does similar things, but has a QA 
process designed to (hopefully) catch those problems before they become 
widely used.

As for the Redhat version number change.  I can understand that as well. 
They are making some serious changes to glibc.  When they change glibc, 
they tend to change major revision numbers.

Whether this is a good thing is difficult to say at the moment.  I have 
some concerns.  Depends on what the interaction is like between the nptl 
thread library and the nVIDIA X drivers are like.  (The last time I looked 
at it, it was not good.)

I believe I get all the benefits (and none of the email noise) of the RHN

Autorpm is free.

Red Hat intentionally took MP3 support out of XMMS in 8.0 due to fears
of patent issues.  If you want an XMMS with MP3 support, look at
www.xmms.org.

Try calling the server by IP address instead of by name?

It sounds like something on the client side, anyhow.  Did you go into
the properties of the connection and select sensible settings (like
CHAP2 only, PPTP as the connection type, encryption to 128, that sort of
thing)?

If you still can't get it, let us look at your pptp configuration.

Good Luck and don't forget to reboot.

(which is what I tried). But, ... the regex code in StarOffice is
proprietary and was unbolted and taken out when the OO.o code was gpl'd. The
option is still an active widget in the dialog box but it does nothing when
checked.

  Being the naive user I am, I asked why one of the GNU regex engines (e.g.,
egrep) wasn't dropped in as a replacement. Stay tuned for further
developments at 11:00.

Mike,

Red Hat took mp3 support out of xmms, but you can
download the RPM to fix it here:

Here's a plugin for RH's XMMS that adds MP3 support:
http://psyche.freshrpms.net/rpm.html?id=107

Otherwise mpg123, mpg321, mp3blaster are CLI players. Freeamp (does
anybody still use this?) is another Winamp clone. Rhythmbox is a slick
gnome2 iTunes ripoff if you can get past the "boogs".

I heard this argument also, or that it should be at the outside of the disk.  
The rotational velocity is faster at the edge so more sector's pass the head 
every second.  Personally I think these are the rantings of no-nothing 
"experts" with too much time their hands.  Who measure the .0001% access time 
difference.  When a HD manufacture comes out and tells me after extensive

Message-ID: <20030324215331.R26214@defiant.ncplus.net>

Howdy!

I have some audio cd's I want to listen to, and the system with the CD
drive doesn't have an audio card. Well, I've installed several cards,
but finding PCI audio these days that Linux can talk to is
challenging. Another system has a very nice ISA audio card that linux
talks to just fine, but there is no internal CD there. I can nsf mount
the CD to that box, but have not had good luck getting audio CD's to
play direct from the CD player to the sound card when they aren't in
the same physical box. I guess I could manufacture a really long audio
cable......    I could move the CD, but that would cause performance
problems with the drives; and yet another SCSI cabling nightmare.

So, I think a good solution would be to get the audio on the CD
converted to some handy file format that could be played on the system
that has the sound card. And what I don't know is what program to use
to extract the signal from the CD into a ?wav? file, or whatever is
appropriate (what _is_ appropriate); and then what program will play
that file.

Anybody have any really good (and relatively easy) suggestions?

(Please, no debian/apt-get solutions!)

I'm running rh7.2 with the TWM desktop. I launch all my window apps
from a console window command line; and I _like_ it that way!

I think many years ago, when access time was measured in seconds, not 
msecs, it probably made more difference, and the idea stuck.

Even to this day, if you format a disk during a Solaris 9 install, it 
claims to have faster performance if the swap space is at the beginning of 
the drive. I don't know if QA actually tested that, or if it's a carry over 
from many previous versions. The same claim is there at least as far back 
as Solaris 2.6.

Bruce,
The typical way to play CDs on a computer does not read the CD as data. The
computer just sends a signal to play the CD and the audio goes from the
Drive directly to the Sound Card. The sound card is only used as a
mixer/volume control. The quick way, if you don't have a sound card in the
computer is to plug your headphones or speakers directly into the jack in
the front of the CD. The CD playing software can still be used to start the
CD and change tracks, it just can't change the volume.

BTW the low-end Soundblaster PCI cards should work fine if you want to take
that path.

Perhaps I've been lucky, or perhaps I have a low end card, but I've
had no real problems with pci audio. Currently I'm using a SB Live 128
or something like that, and very happy with it. There is a lot of
online help for sound cards, through google or the ALSA page. one
reccomendation is to drop $30 on a SB. card and use the kernel
drivers. (I use the EMU10k1 driver, if that helps).

On the topic of ripping audio from CD:

* cdparanoia will make wav's from a music cd, (command line tool)
* lame will encode wav's to mp3 (and possibly ogg? not sure--command
       line)
* arson and grip are both excelent gui apps for putting cd's on your
computer. They are frontends for a bunch of other tools (such as lame
& cdparanoia), so be prepared for a little dependancy nightmare if
your package manager dosen't do it for you. It is well worth it
however.

Both arson and grip have hooks to cddb databases, and do the
ripping/encoding all for you, "in one step" (as far as the user is
concerned). With the cddb hooks, they can name the files as you want
them, you define the format and it does the rest.

Once you have mp3s/ogg files, xmms is a decent music player. The
random track selection isn't very random though.

One of the features of the AIX LVM is the ability to specify in which of
five zones you want the PPs (Physical Partitions) for the volume.  For
lots of stuff, it probably doesn't matter, but if you've got a big
(expensive) system and want to get every last ounce of performance out
of it, it certainly can't hurt, especially if it's easy to do.

But you'd really want swap space or a very active filesystem like /var
or a filesystem containing database files to be in the fastest
portions.  / is scarcely touched after booting, except for /tmp, which
should probably be a memory-based filesystem (like tmpfs) instead.

I don't think I'd be terribly concerned about it in this case; I'd be
more concerned with the lack of space on / (although I'd probably only
give a few hundred MB to / and make the rest /usr/local or /opt or
both).

I thought this was what rplay and rplayd were for.  Set some cd player to
output to /dev/dsp and rplayd picks it up. rplay on the client connects to the
rplayd server and outputs to the local sound card.  http://rplay.doit.org/

The other option is to use ogg files and a server, like gnump3d. A NFS export
of the ogg files to the other box is also possible.
http://freshmeat.net/search/?q=mp3&section=projects&filter=118 will get you a
few ogg cd rippers. There seem to be a few streaming servers also but I can't
find a freshmeat category for them to provide a quick link. A search on
freshmeat for ogg or mp3 should catch the servers as well as anything else. 

I can't speak to the best option as this isn't something I do. I did look into
rplayd for remote, ( all nodes on a private local NOC network ), network
monitor alarms at one time, but did not implement it. I'm not sure if the sound
quality holds up for music or the security implication if you want to use it on
a public network.. 


Thank you

My disk is rated at 7200 rpm, that stays the same as the heads move in
and out, reading sectors as they go.

The rotational velocity is constant, it's the linear velocity that
increases, more of the disk passes over the head each second as the head
moves away from the axis of rotation, but the angular velocity stays the
same.  So the theory is, less time is spent reading sectors at the outer
edges of the disks, if the sectors are all the same arc length
(presumably limited by the density of magnetic particles).

The real question is:  what do they mean by beginning and end?  I think
the drive makers start us off on the fastest part of the disk, radius
doesn't matter.

tomshardwareguide.com does a lot of testing, and for the most part they
all have mostly constant transfer rates, tapering off near the end if
they change at all.  Though I've seen some that drop to almost half the
starting rate.
 
The problem is, this is not a measure of me sitting here with 10 virtual
desktops, 3 other users logged in on other X-consoles (with what ever
games they left running), user-mode linux, apache, mysql, and various
other services running.  The disk is reading from and possibly writing
to 3 different partitions every time I open a program.

The fastest access would be to have all 3 partitions be very small, and
as physically close to each other as possible; all at the beginning of
the disk.

Good Luck

DAMN! I've got the same problem REGEXs don't work for me and neither do
MS-Word's replacement formulae (that was with a caret-p for a new
paragraph). It's a good thing I don't have any major projects to handle with
a word processor.

Back to your issue, do you have complex formatting in your document? If it's
still fairly simple in its layout, you can export to a text file and then
use command line tools or perl to S&R. If it's formatted, you might try
exporting to either HTML or rich text format (depending on which format
preserves more of your desired formatting) and then resort again to command
line tools and/or perl.

I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful. Perhaps the OpenOffice.org
bug-tracking forums might give a clue or three?

  The regex engine in StarOffice is proprietary so it was pulled from the
OO.o version. Sigh.

  There were a couple of suggestions for removing the leading tabs from
within OO.o. However, the suggestion I followed -- successfully -- was to
unzip the disk file and use a text editor's regex engine to remove
<text:tab-stop/><text:tab-stop/>. Then I re-assembled the pieces and it all
worked!

  I've not identified a way to remove only those newlines I don't want, but
this is a start.

If you can identify them, odds are that a regex can be built. But then
it has to work on the XML file format.  If you can send me an example,
I'll send you back a script.

  This is the part where the process fails. I don't want to get rid of all
newlines, only replace double spaces with single spaces and replace the
newlines within a paragraph.

  Looking at the tagged file I cannot distinguish the ones I want from

Do you mean that instead of using word wrapping that they manually
terminate each line?  That might be easy to detect, since real
paragraphs would have consecutive newlines, but I'm only guessing
since I haven't seen the document.

The easiest way to answer hardware-compatibility questions is to 
start with the hardware and see if Linux supports it. Google makes 
that part easy.

If you're building a system from scratch and want to spec the 
individual components, I'd start at the LDP Hardware HOWTO:

  http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO/index.html

The Linux Journal and other journalistic sites also have articles 
about building Linux-friendly systems.

  Has anyone figured out how to convert an OpenOffice.org document to a pdf

ps2pdf.

  Never mind -- I answered my own question. Using the postscript printer
definition and a .ps extension, OO.o wrote the file properly. It _is_ a
postscript file!

  I had not had a postscript printer defined before I added the postscript
module to the printer. Now I have CUPS configured so that laser5_ps does
duplex printing and laser5_non_ps does single-sided printing.

  Yea, it works! Kewl.

  This is exactly how I did it for 14 years in WordPerfect, but I used '@@'
as my paragraph separator.

  Unfortunately, OO.o just does not have this capability now. Sigh. I asked
why the developers don't just drop in the code for egrep and duct tape it in
place. Haven't seen a response yet.

  I've also received no response when I ask why the autocomplete/autocorrect
keeps coming back on every time I open the document and I have to turn them
both off again.

This is what Perl's $/ is for:

  #!/usr/bin/perl -w
  use strict;
  $/ = '';
  open( OLDFH, '< /some/file' ) or die $!;
  open( NEWFH, '> /some/file.new' ) or die $!;
  while ( <OLDFH> ) {
    chomp;
    print NEWFH $_, "\n";
  }
  close( OLDFH ) or die $!;
  close( NEWFH ) or die $!;
  exit;

Setting $/ to an empty string -- as opposed to undef-ing it or setting 
it to "\n\n" -- will tell Perl to "treat two or more consecutive blank 
lines as a single blank line" [Camel, 3d ed. p 666].

chaz,

  I had looked at the ENU, Inc. Web site and picked what I _thought_ I
wanted. Then I went down there and spoke with the sales folks. Told them I'd
be running linux and they guided me to the components that would be best for
it. I ended up with an MSI motherboard, Athlon 2100+, and so on.

  Almost certainly most other places could help you the same way.

Amptron has linux friendly (certified?) motherboards.  Depending on what 
you're building: home/fun workstation, business workstation, or server; 
you'll have to decide ifthey do what you want/need.

I'm so excited.  I got a secure tunnel (STunnel.org) working on a couple 
of systems with more to come.  Still not sure of the why on a couple of 
steps but heck it works.

I'm now to the point of need to have each of the server side pieces to 
start automagically when the system comes up.  I've got the file one for a 
PostgreSQL database established in /etc/init.d set up - kind-of.

Anyone using STunnel have some wisdom to impart on setting it up?

I've never had a working motherboard fail to boot linux.  In fact, linux
has better out of the box support for some chipsets (VIA and AMD come to
mind) than the dark OS.  Some of the on-board extras may not be
supported, but that is becoming less and less of a problem.  In short,
find the motherboard you want, then see if any of the on-board devices
are a problem under linux, instead of trying to find a list of all
compatible motherboards.

Good Luck

Dang, I'm so far behind I don't even know what to do. I'm only at v1.4rc3!

Thankfully Gentoo didn't jump straight to v8.0!

Friends,


HR-2892
-------

We did it! Thanks to those of you who wrote or called your congress
person voicing your support for the "Open Source Consideration Bill," HB
2892! As a result your efforts, we're going to have a committee hearing
before the General Government Committee!!

The meeting will be held at the Capitol building May 3 at 8:30 a.m. in
room HR D. I will send out an announcement a few days before the actual
hearing.

Also, I am organizing a "lobby day" at the State Capitol building in
Salem. I NEED YOUR HELP! It should be just a couple of hours at the
beginning of April. The more of you the better. Don't worry, we have a
crack team that'll get you fired up and ready in no time!


The Linux Show
--------------

I'll be appearing this evening on The Linux Show with the bill's author,
Ken Barber, to discuss the bill; I hope you all can make it.

It's easy to listen in. Just point your browser to
http://www.thelinuxshow.com, click on one of the steaming links (Real
Player, mp3, or ogg-whichever is appropriate), save the file to your
desktop or home directory, and play the "file" with your respective
media player.

Finally, I would like to say a very special "thank you" to those of you
who have stepped forward in support of this bill-your action is very
much appreciated. I can only begin to tell you how incredible our
progress has been so far, and it would not have been possible had it not
been for you.

We still have a long way to go. Fortunately, it's still not too late! If
you'd like to really take an active role in getting this bill to the
floor, drop me an email and let me know!


Very Truly Yours,

Too much typing.  Try this instead:

perl -000lpe 'tr/\n/ /;' input > output

or for in-place editing:

perl -i.bak -000lpe 'tr/\n/ /;' input 

or for dangerous in-place editing:

perl -000lpi -e 'tr/\n/ /;' input 

Might not be enough zeroes in the -000 part.

If you have ghostscript installed, you can invoke spadmin and add
a "new printer" that's basically a pipe to ps2pdf.

This is convulsed - to say the least.  I have a system running vservers 
and am creating individual vservers for each application I'm runnning.  
Database (PostgreSQL), rt (Request Tracker), and a custom application for 
handing domains, hosts and IP assignments.  The idea being I can proto 
type (and run) the application(s) in the vserver and if they go south, get 
broken into, outgrow the capacity of the system, etc. I can move just 
the parts and pieces or kill and create a new vserver.
   Since the database is on one vserver and rt another I want secure
connections between them.  The most platform neutral method seems to be
secure tunnels.  Bandwidth will suck as the apps grown but the security
and ease is worth it.

So I have Stunnel running on the database system and using DBI from my 
custom app and rt I keep (or at least should keep) my data secure.

A cover story entitled "Open-source movement gains ground on Microsoft" Darryl 
Taft comments on Oregon Bill 2892.

My favorite line was a quote from a program manager for Microsoft's shared 
source initiative: "There is not going to be a world where one model wins over 
the other."  So they've given up on crushing open source and an are now trying 
to convince us they're still relevant - nice.

Less impressively the article portrays the Mono project as an initiative that 
Microsoft "spawned". The author goes on to say that Microsoft is going to have 
to do better than that - meaning Mono. I don't think Miguel is going to care for 
that.

Aside from what you've already discovered, OOo has a PDF driver
built-in, just run 'spadmin'.

  I beg your pardon? Hasn't this been Microsoft's business model since 1981?
Isn't this why they were sued by the federal government and declared an Evil
Empire monopoly -- before they bought their way out of any punishment for
it?

  Ha! May the Redmondites lose all business customers and retain all the
home users. May the latter all be AOL customers, too. May the fleas of a
thousand customer support calls (per hour) live in their headsets.

Wil,

  Then I have to su to root first, no? I do for printer stuff.

  As long as I can get it to print a proper ps file to disk then ps2pdf
works like a charm.

You only have to use spadmin to set up the pdf "printer". It will then show up
in your printer list in swriter or other OO app. When asked for the target
directory to save the file in when setting up the pdf "printer", I used $HOME
and swriter saved the pdf to the proper home directory. Nice if you have a
multi-user machine. 

Thank you

All,

Microsoft issued a bulletin to their "Freedom to Monopolize" _ahem_
"Freedom to Innovate" web site yesterday. The bulletin is as follows:

"Open Source Software Procurement Preferences

A small number of state legislators have introduced legislation that
would require state governments to consider open source software when
acquiring new software, and provide justification for using proprietary
software products, including Microsoft's. Proposed legislation in Oregon
(House Bill 2892) and Texas (Senate Bill 1579) seeks to establish a
procurement bias for open source software, which would hurt competition
and innovation in the software industry. Similar legislation will likely
be introduced in other states as well. For more information on the
procurement debate, visit the Initiative for Software Choice."

You can view the posting here:

http://www.microsoft.com/freedomtoinnovate/newsletter/finnews_032503.asp
  
Here's Microsoft's chance to really shine. This is their opportunity to
truly justify their "innovation" as Government IT decision makers put
into writing justification for Microsoft's products in terms of value
for the people of Oregon. I would be absolutely astounded if Microsoft
or the so-called "Initiative For Software Choice" fought this bill.

I am somewhat concerned with their statement that this bill, "...seeks
to establish a procurement bias for open source [sic] software..."
perhaps they've simply misunderstood this bill.

The good news is is that this Open Source consideration legislation is
catching on. Like Ken Barber says, "...like a grass fire." I've just
received an email from a member of the Washentaw Linux User's Group
asking how he can get this kind of legislation to the Michigan's House
of Representatives.

I'll keep you posted.

Friends,


HR-2892
-------

We did it! Thanks to those of you who wrote or called your congress
person voicing your support for the "Open Source Consideration Bill,"
HB
2892! As a result your efforts, we're going to have a committee
hearing
before the General Government Committee!!

The meeting will be held at the Capitol building May 3 at 8:30 a.m. in
room HR D. I will send out an announcement a few days before the
actual
hearing.

Also, I am organizing a "lobby day" at the State Capitol building in
Salem. I NEED YOUR HELP! It should be just a couple of hours at the
beginning of April. The more of you the better. Don't worry, we have a
crack team that'll get you fired up and ready in no time!


The Linux Show
--------------

I'll be appearing this evening on The Linux Show with the bill's
author,
Ken Barber, to discuss the bill; I hope you all can make it.

It's easy to listen in. Just point your browser to
http://www.thelinuxshow.com, click on one of the steaming links (Real
Player, mp3, or ogg-whichever is appropriate), save the file to your
desktop or home directory, and play the "file" with your respective
media player.

Finally, I would like to say a very special "thank you" to those of
you
who have stepped forward in support of this bill-your action is very
much appreciated. I can only begin to tell you how incredible our
progress has been so far, and it would not have been possible had it
not
been for you.

We still have a long way to go. Fortunately, it's still not too late!
If
you'd like to really take an active role in getting this bill to the
floor, drop me an email and let me know!


Very Truly Yours,

I had linux running on that chipset, it was very stable.  The sound has
a good chance of being supported too.

I believe they are both audio only.  At least the mp3 version is.  You can 
save it to disk then use xmms or any other mp3 player.  If your browser is 
set up correctly (perhaps using plugger), clicking on the link should 
automatically spawn an appropiate player.

Cool site, btw.

Gentlemen,

I just spoke with Joe Daunt with Rep. Barnhart's office about specific
things we can do to help HB 2892.

He recommends that we meet the representatives with the General
Government Committee before the Committee hearing on April 3rd.

The Representatives for the General Government committee are as follows:


Rep. Jerry Krummel, Chair 
Phone: 503-986-1426
Email: rep.jerrykrummel at state.or.us

Rep. Donna G. Nelson, Vice-Chai
Phone: 503-986-1424
Email: rep.donnanelson at state.or.us

Rep. Floyd Prozanski, Vice-Chair
Phone: 503-986-1408
Email: rep.floydprozanski at state.or.us

Rep. Brad Avakian
Phone: 503-986-1434
Email: rep.bradavakian at state.or.us

Rep. Derrick Kitts
Phone: 503-986-1430
Email: rep.derrickkitts at state.or.us

Rep. John Mabrey
Phone: 503-986-1459
Email: rep.johnmabrey at state.or.us

Rep. Kelley Wirth
Phone: 503 986-1416
Email: rep.kelleywirth at state.or.us


Please let me know if you would like to schedule an appointment with one
or two of these Representatives. Taking this step will greatly increase
our chances of getting this bill to a House vote. 

The meeting does not need to be a formal affair. Just be honest and tell
what you think and how you feel. They may ask questions about the bill
so try be prepared to answer them. I will give you the details of the
bill if you need them. If you don't know, it's alright; they're not out
to "grill" you, they're just trying to find out as much as they can.
It's okay to say, "I don't know."

When you email me in response, please optionally include your address so
that I can match you with a Representative from your district.

Together I am certain we can bring this bill to a vote. Just a couple of
hours of your time could make all the difference.

Finally, I continue to work on the Lobby Day. I am waiting for word on
the best time for having the event, although I suspect it will be
sometime between the committee meeting and the (hopefully) House vote. I
will keep you posted.


Sincerely,

Some program writers make their source code available
but have no interest in porting the program
themselves. This is still not as much of an obstacle
to interoperability as not having source code. (The
progress of WINE, of course, testifies to the fact
that even this obstacle is not necessarily insurmountable.)

We sort of like them. Tripwire Inc. puts most of its resources behind the 
commercial version, which has a lot of features we'll never see in the free 
edition. Like management and administration utilities. There are people in 
the company who see no value in supporting the free version, or in giving 
anything away. (I have a friend who works there) They've suffered like 
everyone from the recession. However they continue to support the free 
version.

Remember that 'free' means liberty, not free of cost, but that's mostly 
forgotten in favor of 'freeloader' er I mean 'free beer'.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0303261623300.18460-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I have a very old copy of mrproject installed here (0.5.1) and the latest
and greatest is 0.9.x. Because I need to prepare a schedule for a proposal I
thought that I should upgrade. Hah! Fat chance, kiddo.

  mrproject-0.9.1-cf1 requires glib-2.1, gtk+-2.1, gnome-devel-2.x, etc.,
etc. Each of those depends on packages newer than what I have installed
here. Some, such as the pkg-config-0.14 (the minimum version required for
glib-2.1) require glibc-2.3 and I have only glibc-2.2.5 installed here.

  Is this a totally lost cause? If I can do it by building all from source,
how far back do I have to start?

TIA,

Rich

This is the way I think it's supposed to work. They should
promote their own product as a superset. They should not
invent problems with free software that don't exist or
or exaggerate problems just because times are tough.

It's not as if they have a unique product. I wrote a
Tripwire-like program for NetWare some years back and
I still have the code. A port to Linux would not be
hard.

There are a lot of people in the world that need "free beer". In the US,
because the business world uses "non-free beer" it makes little sense to
provide a "free beer" computer to someone who needs "free beer". A "free beer"
person without computer skills needs to learn "non-free beer" to increase their
chances of getting a job or better job.  This seems a catch-22. Think if "free
beer" were adopted by government and business; the saying "it takes money to
make money" might be a little less true and a few more people would be given
opportunity. I believe this is the reason we have public schools, I believe
this is why we have scholarships and grants for higher education, I believe the
government supplies small business loans for minorities for the same reason, to
create opportunity. Opportunity is the mother of liberty, because there is no
liberty in a single choice, no matter how many choose it.

I think the idea of freeloader is wrong, "free beer" can mean liberty.

simply replace the motherboard. The current motherboard

Define "ancient".  Some of us have some pretty old hardware hanging 
around.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0303261755000.18460-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I want to upgrade the chkconfig installation here, and cannot do it by rpm
because of missing dependencies. So, I thought it time to try 'checkinstall'
and build an RPM package while freshening the existing installation of
chkconfig. Despite reading the README file I goofed somewhere; I don't know
where. Ergo, I'd like someone here to teach me where I went off the track.

  Here's the results of my attempt:
--------------------------------------------------
[root at salmo /usr1/pkgconfig-0.15.0]# /usr/local/sbin/checkinstall rpm -Fvh
pkgconfig-0.15.0-1.i386.rpm

checkinstall 1.5.3, Copyright 2001 Felipe Eduardo Sanchez Diaz Duran
           This software is released under the GNU GPL.


The package documentation directory ./doc-pak does not exist.
Should I create a default set of package docs?  [y]: y

Preparing package documentation...OK

Installing with "rpm -Fvh pkgconfig-0.15.0-1.i386.rpm"...

========================= Installation results ===========================

Copying documentation directory...
error: open of pkgconfig-0.15.0-1.i386.rpm failed: No such file or directory

Cleaning up...OK

Bye.

I've got a really solid Asus T2P4 board and a vintage 133MHz Pentium
Classic.  I could even throw in 4 16MB SIMMs. :)

Ray,

    The Linux server is a firewall running Astaro Security Linux - which
is a very refined, cut down Debian variant.  (Well, there actually isn't
much Debian left.)  Astaro is a large firewall distribution, a bit
like Smoothwall, but much better and much more expensive.  It includes
packet filters, proxy servers, virus scans, IPSEC VPN, PPTP VPN, decent
reporting functions, etc.  Unneeded services have been removed to the
point that there are only about 100 commands left.  Most services run
in chroot jails.  It is pretty nice.

    My client wants to support a variety of Windows clients on the
VPN including Win 98, Win ME, Win 2000, and Win XP.  However, most of
the clients are Win 2000 or Win XP.  I have recommended getting IPSEC
client software for all the PCs or possibly using the IPSEC that
comes with Win 2000 and Win XP, but my client is reluctant to switch
from PPTP for a number of very good reasons.  At this point, it looks
like we will install PPTP and gradually migrate to IPSEC - which of
course is much better for several reasons - like it is relatively secure
and PPTP is not.

    In any case, what IPSEC client software do you normally recommend on:

                 Win 98
                 Win ME
                 Win 2000
                 Win XP

Do you recommend MicroSoft's IPSEC on Win 2000 and/or Win XP or do you
recommend something like SSH Sentinel or is there something more
OpenSource than this?

                                                     Dave Mandel

You mean you didn't use Microsoft foundation classes?? How odd.

It may be possible to do something like that with straight procmail, 
but honestly I don't know how robust it'd be. You'll probably want to 
employ a tool like mimedefang:

No, they figured that executables compiled on 9.0 will not run on 8.0 so
according to their version numbering convention, it cannot be called 8.1,
has to be 9.0. The rule for RH is very simple: as long as there is
backward compatibility, the major version number remains the same. When
they cannot guarantee backward compatibility, the major number increases
by one.
In this case, they went from the old Linux threads to NPTL. This change
alone is enough to break backward compatibility completely.

Worse. The first code was in mostly assembler.Then
it was converted to Turbo Pascal. Next time around,
who knows.

Hey,

Is anyone using midgard? Have you gotten it to work? I'm interested to know
because I've spent about four hours working with it, finally got it running and
now seem to be hung up on an authorization failure error when logging in. Anyone
else use it and know it?

Thanks,

Not really an answer to Ed, but I learned something very surprising
the other weekend about shopping for used computers.

I thought I'd have a look to see what was available at Goodwill,
figuring I could pick up an old 486 or Pentium I class computer
there for $20.-- or less. And so the wife & I went over to the
store on SE MLK, I found the electronics section, & I was shocked
at what they wanted for antique computers -- roughly twice what
I would price them at. (The least expensive unit was about $50.--,
& the hard drive was marked ``bad".)

I must not be too unreasonable in my price expectations, because
since then I found it trivially easy to locate similar makes of
used computers for less than Goodwill wanted -- shipping included!

I've noticed that too; I don't know why they're so expensive.  Sometimes
you can find a SCSI cable or an IBM keyboard though.

 	Posix 2003 Portland oregon social information exchange, an event to be
held at PSU, June 27th-29th, is currently recruiting volunteer instructors
for the following courses
	Attached is a breif description of the event, For more info see
http://posix2003.org, especially the planning wikki, or email
organize at posix2003.org.

   *How to convert you home or office from windows to open source. (The
hashed out idea on how to make this most helpful was to have a 4hour
block for hands on help. The participants are expected to bring there
computer and we would have vollunteers there to find out their home or
office needs and help them install the OS and whatever office application
are needed to replace the proprietary software. People who did not bring
their computer are welcome to watch and take notes. We could possible
seperate it into two different time blocks, one for home use, and one for
office use. This would not focus on server side configuration, it is
meant for the beginning end user.)

  *Setting up and managing listserves (Explains itself I believe)

If you are intersted in volunteering for either of these workshops please
email organize at posix2003.org with a brief statement of your qualifications
and experience.

Wow Rich, two dependency problems in just over two hours! Time for you to 
switch to Gentoo!

While it doesn't completely eliminate dependency problems, it's done a darn 
good job of keeping them very minimal!

Tim,

  Actually, I'm slowly making my way to Slackware. I have 8.1 on my notebook
and I'm awaiting the arrival of my 9.0 disks to put on another portable and
a new workstation I'm building. Soon, when I work up the courage and have
the time, I'll switch the running workstations, too. But, I want to learn
the differences between RH and Slack first.
 
  Regardless of distribution, I need to learn what went wrong with my
attempt to use checkinstall. It works with Red Hat, Slackware and Debian by
making the appropriate packages so it will be useful with any of them.

  The dependency problems are the same, not two different ones.

  So, what's wrong with my invocation of checkinstall?

Rich

They have some tested, linux installed machines for $30 or $40.  I

Because the people at Goodwill have no clue as to what a computer is 
really worth these days.  They assume that since they had to pay a lot for 
theirs years ago, it must be worth a bit.  Not true any more.

I'm interested in starting a solar power project (Photovoltaic). To start
small I'm going to get a small PV panel, charger, and battery(ies) to set
up. I'd like to be able to interface the system with one of my Linux boxes
so I can track the state of charge as well as what the panel is producing.

Anyone have any experience, recommendations, etc,  with PCI cards that
would allow me to monitor voltages and such?

In case anyone else has similar interests. I came across the following

A lot of people have been using Dallas 1-wire parts for weather
stations and home automation (like HVAC zone-control) with Linux.  If
you work with batteries that charge to less than 6V, I'd visit our
website http://www.maxim-ic.com and check out the 1-wire parts list.
You probably want a DS2761, and I'm willing to bet you can get an eval
kit for cheap/free.

Heheh :-) No I've been here for 15 years. I'm all too aware of the
insolation levels at that time of year. If I wanted to make the
investment, I do have 900 square feet of southfacing roof, and I see that
solar shingles are now available
https://www.altenergystore.com/cart/1493.html?B57My2Lb;

Part of why I want to do this test is to see what amount of electricity
can be generated on those typical cloudy days vs. the rated full sun
output.

                          "Welcome to GandhiCon 4"

   Thursday, March 27, 2003--Perhaps we'll remember March 18, 2003, as
   E-Day. That was the day when Evans Data Corp. delivered hard numbers
   to substantiate what most of us already sensed in our bones: Linux was
   now clearly on its way to becoming the majority target platform for
   enterprise software development.

   First came the company's release:
   http://www.evansdata.com/n2/pr/releases/3_18_2003.shtml to the press.
   "DEVELOPERS MIGRATING FROM WINDOWS TO LINUX", its headline said,
   adding "52% of Developers Now Targeting Linux Used to Develop for
   Windows". Linux, the survey said:
   http://www.evansdata.com/n2/surveys/linux/linux_03_1_xmp1.shtml, is
   pulling developers away from Windows more than it pulls from various
   forms of UNIX:

     Fifty-two percent of respondents who currently have Linux as their
     target for applications say they used to write applications
     primarily for one of the versions of Windows. Only 30% have
     switched from some form of UNIX to Linux as their primary target.

   Computerwire:
   http://www.computerwire.info/brnews/73C4FE58AF70456D80256CEC0054E3D5
   put the news in perspective, dismissing conventional Microsoft FUD:

     A new survey from Evans Data Corp. appears to contradict
     suggestions from Microsoft Corp. that the growth of the Linux
     operating system has been at the expense of UNIX, rather than its
     own Windows operating system.

   In other words, okay, we'll see your FUD and raise you a few FACTS. I
   immediately wrote and asked Evans Data to share a few more of those
   facts with us, which they kindly provided. Here are some of the target
   platform results:

     Unsurprisingly, Windows OSes are the most common, accounting for
     81% of developers' primary host environments...Linux, too, has
     become a contender in the most-used development OS comparison; 8%
     of respondents use Linux as their primary development OS, which is
     more than all the other flavors of UNIX combined (5.4%).

     For secondary target host environments today, 32% of respondents
     named UNIX, and about half of those (15.5% of the total) named
     Linux.

   For next year's plans, Evans Data said, "Linux use will increase, too;
   8% use it now, but 14% expect to use the open-source OS as primary
   host next year. (That 6% increase is suspiciously similar to the 6%
   decrease in Windows use.)"

   Among development platforms, however, Linux already kicks butt. Here's
   Evans Data:

     Linux is the primary choice of host platform at 40%. Windows 2000
     makes a strong showing at 29%, with Windows XP right behind at 12%.
     The landscape is about to change, however, as you will see below...

     Next year respondents plan to increase their use of Linux as the
     primary development platform by 15%, from 40% to 55%. They also
     plan to increase their use of Windows XP as a development platform
     by 8%, going from 12% this year to 20% next year. Both Linux and
     Windows XP are taking at least some of their share from Windows
     2000, since it drops 15% from 30% this year to 15% for the next.
     Other flavors of UNIX comprise an insignificant share of the host
     development platform this and next year, so Linux is obviously
     taking more share from Windows than any other OS.

   It gets better when we look at development platforms:

     The choice of OS for a development platform does not necessarily
     dictate the choice of OS on which to run the finished application.
     In this case, however, Linux tops the chart on both the development
     platform choice and target platform choice. Forty-percent of
     respondents said they most often target Linux for the OS on which
     their applications will run compared to 43% for all versions of
     Windows combined. Windows 2000 is the primary target for 23% of
     respondents. This distribution implies the bulk of applications are
     likely to be server-oriented, especially since the most often used
     client OS, Windows 95/98, is the primary target for only 8% of
     developers. Windows XP is the primary focus for 8%, as well.

   And what about next year? Get ready to rock:

     When it comes to the primary focus for the target platform for
     applications, the trend for next year follows the same trend for
     what respondents are going to use for their development platform.
     Linux gets the largest increase, going from 40% to 53%. The
     combination of all Windows versions drops from 43% to 33%. Windows
     2000 loses the most attention, going from 23% to 13%. Windows XP
     picks up more focus, going from 8% this year to 17% next year. The
     rest of the categories continue to get an insignificant amount of
     attention.

   Yesterday at PC Forum in Arizona, I talked with Avery Lyford,
   President and CEO of Linuxcare, which is one of the companies working
   to satisfy the demand outlined above. Avery is also an IBM veteran who
   knows the enterprise space extremely well, especially where Linux is
   involved. "It's done," he said. "Linux is a lock. The only remaining
   resistance is around open-source development, and that's only because
   a lot of IT people still don't understand it. But that will change
   soon, too. Count on it."

   Right before I talked to Avery, an IT guy at a Fortune 50 company
   pulled me aside to talk about the rapid movement toward widespread
   Linux deployment at his firm. All he needed to finish making it
   happen, he said, was a few hard numbers. "Do you know any?" he said. I
   told him to watch his e-mail. This morning I sent him the numbers I
   just shared with the rest of you.

   A few weeks back I asked Eric Raymond if he thought we had reached the
   final stage outlined by Mohandas Gandhi's famous quote: "First they
   ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you
   win."

   He replied, "Still GandhiCon 3:
   http://opensource.org/halloween/halloween8.php (they fight you), I
   think, though late in that stage."

   I believe these Evans Data results may have brought us to the verge of
   GhandiCon 4.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0303271453560.30918-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I'd like to understand why remotely logging off a user on another
workstation could cause the monitor to become unresponsive without resetting
that machine.

  I'll ssh to the other workstation and, if my fiancee has not logged out
after a couple of days, I'll kill the open application processes, then xfwm
and her login. It used to work just fine.

  Now, however, if I do that then there's no login prompt that comes up when
we twiddle the trackball or press a key on the keyboard. It's dead and
unresponsive. However, after resetting, it comes back up normally (but with
my thanks for the journaling file system!). When logging out from that
terminal, the problem doesn't appear. That is, the monitor goes into
comatose mode after a while, but wakes up upon movement of the trackball or
press of a key. I'm careful to not kill a system process (such as init) so I
don't know why this lack of response occurs.

  Any insight or thoughts?

TIA,

Rich

At work, I have an older 21" Tektronix monitor on my desk. It's 
capable of running at 1600x1200, but just barely. It looks blurry to 
me at that resolution, so I've settled for running it at 1280x1024.

This morning, however, I configured it to run at 1400x1050, a 
resolution I'd never previously tried.

And, you know, it's not bad. If you've got a large but aging monitor,
you might think about giving it a try.

Actually, I do a similar thing on my 17" monitor at home: it runs at 
1152x864...

I have a 'vintage' 233MHz ATX-oid with 128MB RAM and two HDs: a 1.2GB and a 
20GB (this with two partitions.)

I got an oooLD version of Caldera* up & running, (but I have heard that nfs 
daemons for this distro are hard to find.)

*The box says 'Open Linux 2.2,'2.2.5 kernel, glibc 2.1 and libc 5. Elsewhere 
it mentions NFS 2.2, and NIS 2.0.

What do I need next?

OTOH, would anyone recommend a non-Debian distro that will fit on my hardware 
(to use as a somewhat sslloow file server on a small network) so that the OS 
resides on the eentsy HD? I don't need a GUI, either, just flip the power 
swithc, type in a user namw & pw, say 'hello' to the other two computers (a 
mount command or two,) and now I can back up 18GB or so of data from the 
other two guys.

I have a single Linux box (RH7.3) and no home network...yet.  I am still
doing dial-up Internet.

What should I have in /etc/hosts?  I have checked several Linux books and
Google, and am still scratching my head about what would be best here.

Define "ancient".  Some of us have some pretty old hardware hanging 
around.

  To follow on what Tim suggested, here're the first two lines from
/etc/hosts on this machine:

127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost
192.168.55.1    salmo.appl-ecosys.com   salmo, mail

  There's an additional line for each additional host on the network --
including the virtual win98 that runs in VMware on occasion.

Tyler,

  The "advantage" is communicating with the unwashed masses who still use
Microsoft products. They not only provide templates and other documents in a
winWord format, but many want products delivered to them in a winWord
format. Ergo, OO.o or AbiWord.

  FWIW, OO.o suffers terribly in comparison with WordPerfect. However,
Dollar Bill did his historical job of killing it off. First, he bought a big
financial stake in Corel to "save" the company. Then he killed WordPerfect
-- at least for linux if not all together, then he sold his stake and left
Corel to flounder on the wave-beaten coast. Another -- better quality --
competitor gone.

Subject: [PLUG] HB 2892 News Update
Message-ID: <1048867562.10296.2862.camel@sparticus.coopnkass.com>

Friends,

Ken Barber and I spent yesterday at the Capitol building speaking with
legislators about HB 2892. I am encouraged to report to you that our
visit was a success.

First, the bill is scheduled for hearing before the General Government
Committee on Thursday, April 3rd. If there is general consensus, the
committee will hold a "workshop" to discuss the bill and if a majority
"okay's" the bill, they will send it on either to the House floor for a
vote or to another committee.

Secondly, the bill moves to the Ways and Means committee. Because this
bill has the potential for having a major financial impact on the State
(read: saving them a truckload of money), the Ways and Means committee
will look at the bill from a fiscal standpoint.

Finally, if the bill passes the Ways and Means committee, it is carried
to the House floor for a vote. If it makes it to the floor for a vote
you can bet that I will be _in_ the House chambers for that and will
keep you updated just as soon as the voting is closed.

Meanwhile, Joe Daunt with Rep. Barnhart's office has done a fantastic
job of organizing a diverse list of people to testify before the
Committee. I will update you when I know more.

Here are some of the highlights of our visit:

First, we now know that a representative from Microsoft has already been
to Rep. Krummel's office for a visit. Apparently, Microsoft told Krummel
that this is an "anti-Microsoft" bill. I am told that Krummel indicated
to the Microsoft representative to the effect that that was patently
false. I doubt that MS will get much traction with the legislature,
especially given the serious budget cuts they have recently endured.

By the way, Rep. Krummel is very knowledgeable about this issue. I
thought going into the meeting that I would be doing a lot of talking. I
learned very quickly in the meeting that I would be doing a lot of
listening. He already knew!! If you are a small business owner or care
about open source, this is one man you definitely want in your corner;
he is extremely knowledgeable about the challenges that face these two
groups.

Second, we have _huge_ support for this bill, including:

  Steven McGeady, former VP of Intel. 
  Larry Rosen, Council for the Open Source Initiative
  Joseph Scott Miller, Law professor at Lewis & Clark College
  Quentin Harman, Technology Coordinator for Fern Ridge School District
  Shane Warden, O'Reilly
  
There are many, many others. I have a three page list and we're still in
the early stages.

Red Hat contacted Rep. Barnhart's office while we were meeting with the
Committee legislators. I will follow up with them today. 

Over the weekend Rep. Barnhart's office will work to get a better
picture of where the committee members' support lies with this bill. I
am scheduled to call at 1:00 p.m. on Monday to find out where our
efforts are needed in support of HB 2892.

On a personal note, I was truly amazed to see the system in action. The
capitol building is just absolutely humming with activity. I was witness
to a House floor vote. Let me tell you, when it comes time for a vote
they bar the doors and post the guards. These guys are not kidding. 

The Representative's offices themselves each has a cubical area that is
open to the hallway as you pass by. The cubical is very accessible. One
feels invited to walk right up to their Representative's assistant and
schedule an appointment; it's just amazing! Overall I felt a sense that
the Representatives actually cared, that the work they do is important.

Again, thanks to all of you who have written, called, or visited in
support of this bill. I cannot stress enough that without your support
none of this would have happened.

If you haven't yet written or called your legislator in support of this
bill I urge you to do so. The toughest fight is yet to come and we need
all of the support we can get. If you need to find out who your
legislator is, you can find out here:

  http://www.leg.state.or.us/findlegsltr/findset.htm

Please know that your legislators very much welcome your input. I
encourage each of you to take the time to schedule an appointment to
meet with them.

I'll keep you posted.


Very Truly Yours,

Shallow learning curve. I'm not proud; I haven't learned nearly enough basic
operating system skills to start exploring applications that I don't have an
obvious and immediate need for.

If one is only accustomed to brain-dead single-user operating systems and
the tools that accompany them, one should use a word processor with a
familiar user interface. The best tool for a small job is not always the
best tool in existence.

  I just learned something both interesting and bothersome: the PostScript
files produced by mozilla-1.2.0 and opera-6.0 when printing to disk are
different. This would not be an issue except that the flavor produced by
Opera cannot be translated into ASCII text by ghostview-6.52.

  I printed a Web page with opera to a disk file. A table did not properly
display because it's wider than the page. So I decided to translate it to
text and re-format it so I could print it out. No luck: gv error. However,
when I went back with mozilla, it worked like a charm.

  And I thought that postscript was postscript and that the 6.52 version of
ghostscript/-view could handle the different ps versions.

Message-ID: <20030328181920.GA5591@dalsemi.com>

I wanted to play with the newest Mozilla, so I downloaded the
latest .tar.gz file and stuck it where it wouldn't interfere
with our default install:

/design/nwdc/libs/usr/local/mozilla

Then I copied the start-up script to 

/design/nwdc/libs/usr/local/bin

I can start mozilla where I unpacked it, but not if I call it
from /design/nwdc/libs/usr/local/bin (which is in my path).

Any ideas as to what I need to do to make it happy?

Thanks,
Colin

If you attempt to start it from the non-working location, from a command line, what do you get? Any error messages?

PostScript is a programming language, albeit one optimized for

Just like differnet compilers produce different assembly code, so 
different PostScript drivers produce different .ps files.

Did you use md5sum to verify that you got a good copy of the iso?  Check 
and make sure.  Sometimes glitches happen.  (I have seen one case where a 
mirror has had a bad copy of an ISO as well.  They were notified and it 
was fixed, but it could happen again.)

  And here I thought that any Level 1/2/3 postsript was the same as any

The biggest problem is he wants a minimal install with nfs daemon.

Most installs are not that user friendly.

Could probably do it with mandrake, but I would have to see how easy it is 
to hack it back to something useful.

Tyler,

  If you would like to produce TeX typeset documents with a 10-15 minute
learning curve get a copy of LyX (http://www.lyx.org/). Do the tutorial and
start writing. As you need more knowledge you'll pick it up from the docs
and the mail list.

Hello,

I'm new here. Or rather, not there yet--I'm planning on moving to
Portland soon, and thought I'd start reading the local LUG. =)

I have used Knoppix as a GUI installer for Debian in a couple of ways,
and it's fabulously useful. It's been said by various people I've talked
to that you can determine if a machine (and its hardware) will be
supported by Linux by plopping in a Knoppix cd and booting. If it finds
the hardware in question, it's supported. If not, you're going to have a
bitch of a time figuring out how to get the thing working. =)

That said, there's a problem with the using-knoppix-as-a-gui method,
which is that Knoppix's install method installs EVERYTHING. So you end
up with 2 gigs of crap, which if you have the space is great cause you
rarely find you need anything, but if you're a minimalist like me, is
irritating. However, if you want to do that, here's how you do it:

Pop a Knoppix 3.1 cd into the cd drive, and boot to it. If you haven't a
bootable cd, grab their floppy. Once the GUI comes up, you can play with
it and decide if you like it, or you can just go and install it by
switching to the first virtual terminal (ctrl-alt-f1, as I'm sure
everyone knows) and typing knx-hdinstall . It's graphical, but very
barebones. You've got to have 2.2 or so gigs free, and such.

So I moved on to another method: boot knoppix, format the hard drive
that you want to install on, mount it, and run the command debootstrap
(it's usually debootstrap [woody|sid] /mount/point, but I always look it
up anyway in the man pages). This gives you the bare debian installation
with no frills, into which you copy Knoppix's configuration files (X,
network stuff, modules) and Knoppix's kernel, and you have a working
system (With a bit of tweaking). It definitely requires some work
though.

However, I have also installed Just Plain Debian, and I have to say that
it's not really so bad. You don't need to know truly arcane things,
until you get to X configuration. Then Debian requires you to know
Everything And More (EAM, or part of REAM, REALLY Everything And More
=). 

Debian, though, is FABULOUS if you have a) a truly simple graphics card,
like the Matrox MGA/Millennium (I, II), or b) no need for X. 

If you're looking for a user-friendly debian distribution, and knoppix
is too large, you might also consider Xandros. I've been hearing
fabulous things about the install--that it's as good as Knoppix, and
that the install is actually meant for installing).

"Microsoft's statement on Wednesday that it would not offer a version of a
security patch for NT 4.0 has called into question an earlier promise to
continue supporting the operating system through the end of 2004 and raised
concern among its customers."

"Despite efforts to encourage its users to migrate from the NT platform to
Windows 2000, more than a third of the company's installed base still consists
of machines running NT 4.0, according to Al Gillen, research director of
systems software at IDC."

"Due to (the) fundamental differences between Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000
and its successors, it is infeasible to rebuild the software for Windows NT 4.0
to eliminate the vulnerability," Microsoft said."

Not true, I am not a developer, and I can install debian.  All you
really have to know is how you want your hard drive partitioned, and the
name of the module that your network card uses.  The former is hardly
expert knowledge, and the latter can be found by trial and error (and
some educated guessing).  Everything else is laid out for you, all you
have to do is read and answer simple questions.

I'll admit it isn't that easy, you will have to come back every once in
a while to answer some more questions, but the flexibility is pretty
amazing; I've been able to install debian on a larger variety of
equipment than any other OS.

If you select the simple method for software packages, you can customize
the servers and services to run, including the choice of an X-server. 
The debian package management system is really easy to use, too.

Tough it out through an install on an old Pentium system, it will then
be a very user-friendly install :)

Good Luck,

Tyler,

  If you look at the pedigree it all makes sense. In the beginning Donald
Knuth created TeX. About a year later Leslie Lamport made a set of macros to
make writing in TeX easier, and that was named LaTeX. Many generations later
someone wore out the backslash and curly bracket keys by writing LaTeX and
remembering all the macros, so he and his friends but a GUI wrapper on LaTeX
and called it LyX.

  One can still put raw LaTeX in the document. For some reason, it's
referred to in the LyX community as ERT (for Evil Red Text because the
embedded LaTeX code is displayed in red). Shrug.

  There are still a number of masochists (one of whom I know) who still
write in raw TeX. Not LaTeX, TeX. That's like writing the linux kernel in
machine language. Shudder! But, as it is written, different strokes for
different folks.

  Have fun and be productive! Oh, don't forget to check out the styles for
theses, dissertations and various publications.

I may have found a bug-let in Perl, and I'd like to test it on as

I'd appreciate it if as many of you as possible would run the following

use (from perl -v) and your operating system it would help me a lot!

Thanks,

p.s. If you're wondering why I didn't send this to the local Perl

And what do you think is the bug?  You'll need to explain
what you expected, and why.

Also, just posting a "perlbug" would get it right to the people who
can best explain it, or make a patch for it.  No need to have dozens
of people around you looking quizically at your post and the output of
the program.

Dude, you give pdx.pm a disrespectful nod that is just FUD.  You
should have just asked, and taken the heat if it was offtopic.  Lots
more Perl people there than here.

And what do you think is the bug?  You'll need to explain
what you expected, and why.

Also, just posting a "perlbug" would get it right to the people who
can best explain it, or make a patch for it.  No need to have dozens
of people around you looking quizically at your post and the output of
the program.

Dude, you give pdx.pm a disrespectful nod that is just FUD.  You
should have just asked, and taken the heat if it was offtopic.  Lots
more Perl people there than here.

Ooo Ooo, can I take a crack at this one?

Is the answer because $c is scoped with a my, and the statement

print ".D(${c}[$d])\n"; 

creates an anonymous block, which loses the value of $c, much like when 
matching regexes with $1, $2 and so on?

note: after doing a little searching, it looks like this could be a bug of 
sorts...

http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters at perl.org/msg85466.html

and

http://archive.develooper.com/testlist at perl.org/msg00027.html

Or, is this not a "bug" as described in RFC 64?

Subject: [PLUG] Updating glibc on RH
Message-ID: <3E85009B.10305@pacifier.com>

This has always bugged me: when updating the glibc libs there is a batch of 
stuff in the i386 tree, but then there are a few in i686, namely 
glibc-2.2.5-43.i686.rpm

Since all my machines are i686 class, I'd prefer to use this as opposed to 
the i386 version.  But you can't, because it needs the matching version of 
glibc-common from the i386 branch.  If you first update i386/glibc* then try 
to update i686/glibc* nothing happens becasue rpm doesn't see any difference 
between glibc-2.2.5-43.i686.rpm and glibc-2.2.5-43.i386.rpm

So it looks like I need to do this from the i386 tree

# rpm -Fvh glibc-devel-* glibc-common-* glibc-profile-* glibc-debug-static-* 
   glibc-utils-* ../i686/glibc-*

That's just seems ugly.  Not so bad if your repository is on localhost, but 
  you have to script this for ftp on a lan.  At least if they symlinked the 
stuff common to both archs life would be easier.

Having said that, I have used the i386 glibc on celerons & pentiums with no 
adverse effects.  Anyone know how to determine which arch of glibc you have 
installed?

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

My education ins in mechanical engineering some metallurgy, and some foundry

spend months weight training so that the rock doesn't feel heavy. Not 
practical in the short term - so that's why I'm leery of Debian.

Well, I'll chime in with another recommendation for Knoppix.  I don't 
use it for an actual install, but I do use it to help determine my X 
settings and other hardware information.  It's got one of the best HW 
detection schemes around.

  After finding that the system barfed on the duplicate (386/686) packages I
rm'd the 686s and just upgraded with the 386 flavors. The system's are happy
and so am I.

Use 64-bit integers?

Does your kernel have *secure* setuid scripts?

Do you want to do setuid/setgid emulation?

Unless you have VERY STRONG reasons to change anything, just
hit return a bunch.

I generally set only the Prefix value, and I do it from the command-line:

 ./Configure -ders -Dprefix=$HOME

for example.  No questions asked then.

How did you manage to install both?  --nodeps ?
I'd experiment but for the nature of the package in question.  Been there...

The education I'm talking about happened before and after you bought the
card.  That decision must have been based on some sort of information
processing, or did you just buy the cheapest thing there and now expect
it to work out of the box on every OS?

No distribution can do that for all hardware.  I will admit it would be
nice, but since no OS can do it for all hardware, I chose to learn one
that can install consistently on a large variety of hardware.

But it feels great to know that I can move mountains without the fragile
lever or the fuel sucking (and limited) machine.  (It also feels great
to know that I own the mountain and can modify it in any way I want
to.)  I also feel that I'm not in this for the short term, I'm pretty
much banking on the fact that there is going to be a need for OS
installs in the future.

  I didn't. Rather than spend a lot of time trying to learn why there were
two versions of only a couple of packages, or building to multiple targets
from the .src.rpm, I shrugged and freshened only the 386 versions. Figured
that with this older, PII/333 MHz box that would do me just fine.

  I've an amalgam of build targets for applications here, and almost all of
them spend a great deal of time waiting for me. Since I have the machine
spending relatively very little time running on its own at maximum speed, I
decided that the glibc libraries could be of the lowest common denominator
without my seeing any deleterious effects.

My systems are RH 7.3, so this should all be relevant.  The apache rpm 
should have installed /etc/init.d/httpd

Assuming that it did
# service httpd start

should do it.  If you don't have this script, try erasing apache and 
reinstalling.

To make it happen on boot,
#chkconfig httpd on

(by default, this will start the daemon in runlevels 3,4,5)

I did not use the rpm to install it.  HTTPD is absent on the server. 
How do I get the HTTPD deamon on there using the source, which is all I
have been able to find.

All,

I recently obtained a Promise Technologies SimpleSCSI card and was going to put
it into a box I'm building. I saw a couple of archives on the web indicating
most scsi drivers are supported, short of the manufacturer really screwing
things up. The chip is a Symbios 53C810AE. I was wondering if anyone has this
card running, and under what versions of linux.

Thanks,

You said earlier that Apache is working, right?  Are you using Apache or 
another web server?  Other servers may call their daemon something other 
than "httpd".  Is your source an rpm or tarball?

Just compile Apache according to the directions in the INSTALL
file. Since it's not an RPM, you'll have to make decisions
about the directories that should be used. If you have no
idea about what directories you should use, choose /opt/web.
Then you'll be able to manually launch Apache with this command:

/opt/apachectl start

You can create a httpd file in the /etc/init.d directory 
by copying abother of the files in the directory and modifying
it. Use the above command in that file to start Apache and
this command to stop it:

/opt/apachectl/ stop

If you're not up for all this, you're better off finding
an Apache RPM, so all this will be done for you automagically.

If others respond with Red Hat-centric advice, ignore what
I say and follow their advice. I'm not a Red Hat enthusiast.

Yes, it is I again, and yes, it is 6:30 on a Saturday morning as I write
this. I just wanted all of you to know that I have extensively updated
the MWVLUG's site to help keep all of you up to date on the latest,
including a special legislation page, driving directions, and an FAQ. 

  http://www.mwvlug.org

I still need help. We have past meeting updates and handouts to post
online. These are just two examples. So if you would like to contribute,
please let me know!

I will also be gearing up for a lobby day in the next few weeks so it's
time to start thinking about working a four hour "shift" to "person" a
booth ( :-) C.D. ) at the capitol building. The booth features two
computers that you can use to show legislators about open source. The
machines themselves are totally hidden; only the monitors, keyboards,
and mice show. It really looks good.

I need your help so please let me know!

Be careful that you don't do that as a function of MWVLUG if the LUG
is an official 501(c) charitable organization, because only a PAC can
lobby, not a charity.  Even if you're not a charitable organization
yet, if you ever decide to do that in the future, lobbying will kill
your app.

I've been on the board of three 501(c)3's.  The rules are pretty
carefully worded.  Charities cannot be politically active.  PACs don't
get tax-deductible contributions.  That's why they're distinct.

I can't tell you why the method you described causes trouble.  However, I 
thought I'd mention that just sending a SIGHUP to the X process, i.e.

kill -1 pid_of_X_process

or

kill -HUP pid_of_X_process

will log her off without having to kill all of those other processes 
individually.

In the off chance it doesn't work out, FreeGeek has ample supplies of Adaptec
and other SCSI cards for $10 each.   Multiple versions of Adaptec cards.

I was there the other day looking for a small/thin pc.  I was dismayed to 
learn that they don't sell their hardware to the public.  There is a bit of 
stuff in the "store" but there was many cool-looking boxes piled up next 
door in the window that are off-limits to non-non-profits (although I am 
unemployed, don't think that counts.)

Question is, anyone selling interesting hardware?  Wacky Willies NW is 
mostly monitors & keyboards. I remember their Aloha store being better, but 
it's been years and I don't get out there much at all.

There was the place off Belmont & 34th?, but they turned unfriendly and 
always seem closed.  As mentioned earlier, the Thrift stores have gone 
upscale, I actually paid for a CueCat ($2) but I got that much fun out of it 
before throwing it in the drawer of future projects.

Hi Bill,

When I call up gcombust (my favorite front end for cdrecord and
friends), there is a setting for "allow 32 char filenames".  Since this
is on by default, I've never burned with it off.  However, this does
seem like it would be an option for cdrecord and/or mkisofs.  There is
also an option (off by default) for "allow untranslated filenames", but
I've never had a need to try it.

Mark,

  That would bring up the bash prompt. No one here goes directly to the GUI;
sometimes it's just easier to do a few simple tasks from the console.

This is true, but needs some clarification.  The www.freegeek.org website 
says it all, but this is the gist of it breifly.  The Primary Mission of Free 
Geek is to recycle computers in a responsible manner, and prevent their 
dumping into landfills.  

As part of that mission, we also provide a means for people who cannot afford 
to purchase a computer to get one in exchange for hours worked in our 
processing of donated equipment.  We also make equipment available to local 
non-profits as we are able.  

We try to provide other services to the community, including in various 
education classes, mostly Linux related.  (see website for listing).

It was never the intention of Free Geek to be a reseller of used computers 
and components.  However there are many items that are not needed to complete 
our main mission, and these are offered for sale to the public in our Thrift 
Store.  While not everything you might want is for sale, there are many cool 
things available.  For example large monitors, various expansion cards, 
inkjet and lazer printers.   We often have things like PDA's, Zip Drives,  
and speaker sets with sub-woofers, depending on the whim of the donating 
public.

In closing, I will make a plea to save some of our white elephants.  We have 
a lot of old Sun boxes and monitors, as well as a couple of SGI's, and an HP 
NetServer that we need to be rid of, before we have to recycle them by a more 
destructive means.

Thanks for your support of our mission.

Yup, its a problem with mkisofs. It needs an -R option to cause it to
write extra info that allows the files on the CD to appear to have stuff
like uid, gid, ownership and proper file names.

The book I used before, Red Hat Linux 7.3 Bible, forgot to mention this,
perhaps thinking that a Linux user might deep in his heart prefer DOS
file names.

Correct usage: mkisofs -R -o /tmp/whatever.cd  /home/weewillywinkle

I love the mission and you guys are doing Dog's work.  Was mainly interested 
in the things that no one else wanted or knew what to do with.  I don't want 
to take some one's NetPC/future-firewall.  But SGI's?  They weren't in the 
store last week.  Does one need a secret handshake?

Cheers,

That's what I'm talking about, although that's quite a hike for a crapshoot.

If you'd put them out or somehow make us aware where they are or whom to
ask about them, many of us would love to take them away.

I love going to the OSU auctions, they always have some great deals and
bidding for things in a live auction is always fun.  Beware though, the
more "exotic" computers (non-Intel boxes that is) they almost always
come by the pallet and there's typically 10-15 per pallet, however you
can often pick up a pallet full of interesting computers for $20.

You can often get good deals on office furniture too if you don't mind
it being a little old and sometimes slightly beat up (but still
functional).  All the used office furniture places in town have prices
at least an order of magnitude more expensive than what I've picked up
stuff in Corvallis for.

Try to find Rick Konold & ask him for help. The other volunteers they
have manning the store appear to have the attitude of ``we can't sell
anything that's not in the store." I spoken to Rick a number of times,
& I gather FG is ***EAGER*** to sell off as much of the stuff next
door as they can. (I saw a pair of SGI Indys in there for which Rick
quoted me $10.-- apiece. Mention my name & I'm sure he'll be willing to
sell them to you for $15.--.)

That was the gist of my rant about GoodWill, with the implicit question
of whether they still have their ``unsorted" outlet. You know, the junk that
is donated to them & they try to sell off for a few dollars: mutant knitting
projects, Tom Clancy paperback novels, old Debbie Gibson cassette tapes.
I figure that would be where they have the 486s, Mac 68xxx's & other
obsolete computers.

Slashdot had an item about this not too long ago. Wacky Willy's was all
that was mentioned for the Portland area. I snarfed a link to Seattle area
used hardware stores which I can share if anyone is interested. (One
place that got frequent mention was the Boeing resale store: I wonder if
Tektronix or Mentor Graphics ever had a similar junk store.)

You know it's time to put the keyboard down and walk away when....


I have a bash script that which needs to cd to arbitrary users' home
directories. I cannot assume the home directories are in /home and 
the account info is pulled from different sources (pam_ldap, pam_smb, etc)
so I can't just grep /etc/password.

With tilde expansion, this is a piece of cake:

	cd ~bob 

but if "bob" is in an environment variable, it breaks because the tilde
expansion occurs first:

	export FOO=bob
	cd ~$FOO
	bash: cd: ~bob: No such file or directory


Would someone be so kind as to hit me with a clue stick on this one? ;-)

The only one I know of is on SE Maclouglin across from the Acropolis: 
dimly lit, smelly, popular for grabing clothes and shoes, people seem to 
live there and drag cardboard boxes tied to their belts instead of shopping 
carts.  Not much on electronics, OTOH, the Acropolis makes a _really_ good 
burger.

I did try that one...

	$ export FOO=bob
	$ eval `cd ~$FOO`
	bash: cd: ~bob: No such file or directory

"cd ~$FOO"  is executed before eval is executed, which puts me back into
the same problem of "~" expanding before "$FOO" expands.

Terry's approach:

	export FOO=bob
	eval "cd ~$FOO"

works because $FOO is expanded by the shell and then

	eval "cd /home/bob"

is executed.


This would have been so much easier in perl ;-)

Thanks for the help!

Boeing surplus is fairly good, but the pickings can range from weird (bins 
full of 8" tires ), to full size plotters, Macs, the odd RS6000 CAD 
workstation etc.  I didn't think the prices were as low as I thought they 
should be, but they are still pretty cheap for most stuff.  You can also 
pick up some very interestingly shaped bits of aircraft-grade aluminum 
while you are there :-)

Seattle City Surplus is good if you can find it.  I've picked up several 
(10+) Pentium 133 machines for $5 each w/video, RAM, CDROM, HD, floppy 
etc.  I.e. all working.  When I bought 5 machines, they let me carry away 
as many PCI and ISA network cards as I could find.  They've also got a lot 
of laser printers. I picked up a fully functional HP 4MV (prints up to 
11"x17") for $30.  How much and what they have varies a lot.

They rarely have anything exotic, but for a firewall or spare parts, it's 
pretty good.  They often have office equipment too, like copiers.

Best,
Kyle

Nope.  You've mis-interpreted the request: Not "~/bob" but "~bob" (i.e.,
not $HOME/bob, but bob's $HOME).  In your example, the "~" gets expanded
when you set the variable--try 'echo $HOMEDIR' and you'll get your home
directory.  Even if you quote the tilde it does not work.

Belmont Computer is fine, I wasn't talking about them.  Can't remember the 
name, but it is 1 blk S. of Belmont on 34th or so.  Last time I was in 
Belmont Computers they were new stuff only so I hoped there wouldn't be any 
confusion when I was mentioning surplus outlets.

For all I know the place with the forgetable name is cool again too.  Don't 
want to disparage anyone who hasn't pissed me off recently.

I'm running RH8.0 on a workstation I'd like to listen to MP3s on.

I've uninstalled the default xmms player (because RedHat removed MP3 support from it) rpms and installed the 
ones suggested at xmms.org (thanks Wil and others). The thing appears to run correctly, and would have 
convinced me it was running perfectly if I were deaf. CDs play perfectly, I get sound effects from input 
errors, but no sound from MP3s.

The rpms I have installed now are:

Binary packages:
xmms-1.2.7-13.i386.rpm
xmms-mpg123-1.2.7-13.i386.rpm (mpg123 plugin)
xmms-skins-1.2.7-13.i386.rpm (skin package)
xmms-devel-1.2.7-13.i386.rpm (devel package)

as listed at: 
http://staff.xmms.org/priv/redhat8/

Maybe I broke some setting while goofing with it, but these are freshly installed.

Any help appreciated.

Maybe you need to kill a daemon or program that's
using up your sound device. see if "killall esd"
works. I never get problems with xmms, but other
programs seem to like it when I do this.

If that doesn't work, try playing a file from another
format, such as Ogg Vorbis. CD's don't count because
the CD drive often has a direct connection to the
Sound Card.

I find that -r is often times better. It sets the
owner  and group of all the files on the CD to root,
and sets everything to chmod 444 or 555 as
appropriate. I've gotten headaches about mismatching
UID's if I try to access an old '-R' cd's after I've
wiped my drive clean and installed a new distro, thus
having to login as root to just copy the file. (It
seems that I had a few chmod 600 files).

Also if you plan on using these CD's with Windows, It
would be a good idea to use the -J flag too for long
filenames in Windows 95+. I, personally, don't have
any intention of using Windows, but I set this flag
just in case.

Peace,

"Sounds" like your pcm level is turned down. 
Can you play any other types of sound files? If not,
fire up aumix or your favorite mixer and increase pcm.

aumix looks okay. I get sound from Cd's direct and beeps when I do bad things at 
the keyboard, too. The CD player is kscd, or something like that.

I've tried after killing all daemons (reboot) but I'll try the killall esd you 
suggest, too.

I've played with all other formats, still no sound. What's the default format? 
While tweaking with it befre learning of the RH MP3 tweakage, my son and I goofed 
with it quite a bit.

I'm wondering if my issues aren't with a deeper level setting, but I don't know 
where that could be.

believe that went out of business last year. (They were just down the street

Good point. Both your -r and -J points would apply to say a collection
of Java examples, which you'd what to be as portable as possible in
spite of the /r/n problem.

But if I'm backing up a home directory -R would be better, right?

Yes, one of the uses is backing up files from a Samba directory which
has files from that other OS.

Hi all,
I was having trouble last week installing Mandrake 9.1.  Found the problem.
My down load of the 3rd disc was bad.

Got a interesting point.  When you are install 9.1 and when you come to
a screen asking you if you wish to check for updates, the default is no, 
change this
to 'yes'.  If you don't the install will freeze later on and it does not 
install correctly.
I tried installing 5 different ways and it kept locking up at the end. 
 It wasn't until
I checked yes on the check for updates screen that the install worked.

Have a good day
Abraham Zwygart

As Rick pointed out, our main mission is to recycle computers and give
them away for free. (Both those things, plus teaching people about the
technology and issues are part of the mission, which gets complicated to
expalin to folks, but hey -- life is complicated!) The store is a way to
support the main mission, so some things (that would detract from the free
products we create) will never be in the store. Though what those things
are will change over time.

> Try to find Rick Konold & ask him for help.



Rick's job is Sales Coordinator, so he's a logical person to look for. But
also, any volunteer working in the store should be able to help out.

The reason the other staff members and volunteers may seem to have an
"attitude" about what gets sold is pretty simple. All the staff at FREE
GEEK have a zillion responsibilities to manage at any given time. Quite a
number of people walk into FG expecting that it is primarily a store, and
therefor expect us to drop what we're doing to service them. We try to
politely point them to Rick and the store, so that we can get back to:

- teaching people who don't even know how to click a mouse about computers,


- getting the zillions of donations into the database (again showing
volunteers that range from complete newbies on up how to do the job
without making too many mistakes)
- getting tested stuff built into computers,


- bringing people who want to learn how to build computers up to the point
where they can learn that (teaching how to identify all the components,
understand BIOS and resource conflict issues, etc.),

- teaching coding skills and developing software for testing hardware,
running the database, getting linux onto the FreekBoxen,

- dealing with industrial recylcers,


- working with end users to make the distro choices as simple to use as
possible.

Anyway, there's a lot going on. Many people to needed to help. Drop by and
ask about volunteering if you're so inclined (and haven't already
started).

I wouldn't. The thing is, RockRidge stores UID's, not
usernames. So when I went back to get some
files--despite the fact that both when writting and
reading the cd my username was 'vince'--the UID's
didn't match and I still got those problems. I guess
it would work if you add users by editing /etc/passwd
directly and give the same user the same UID each
time.

If I need to keep file permissions intact I just use
tar, other wise -r works for me.

Peace,
Vincent Damewood

Yup, it's there, too.

I'm currently re ripping the MP3s. Looks like something was terribly
wrong with them, they were all 128B.

Maybe the stupid KDE default of showing only the filenames could be
improved on...

Thanks to everyone who responded.  I sent an email to the Perl bug
tracking system, and found out that someone on the perl development
team had found the bug a little while ago, and it will be released
in 5.8.1

As far as I know, userNAMES are never stored in the file system. It's ALWAYS UID and GID. The OS does the lookup to see who owns a fileentry.

Okay, here is the thing- You MUST have MP3s to use them in the smms
player. I did not. I forgot to choose a compression method in ripperX,
so it only had the CDDB info for the song.

Feeling really stupid right now....

 Think its bad now? Try overhauling your sound setup with alsa....works
beautifully, once its set up. But be prepared

Subject: [PLUG] using proxy to transform pages
Message-ID: <20030331190531.GA29117@edge>

I have some webpages I visit regularly that
I have written a perl parser for. Given the url, it 
grabs it, parses it, and spits out another more useable
webpage for my consumption.
Is it possible to set up a proxy that watches for
pages coming back from this particular set of pages,
runs my parsing script and passes the transformed
page on to me? For all other pages it should just 
let them through unchanged.


Thanks,
Bill Barry

I think a valid arguement could be made that you aren't hiding anything, since the packets have valid headers on them, otherwise, they wouldn't work. 

No, they aren't in plain text, but they must be vaild packets with both origin and destination in the headers. 

The same could be said for NAT. Even though your NAT system readdresses the packet, you're not hiding the origin (you still send it through the gateway, didn't you?) and obviously, if the packet reaches it's destination, it must be listed too.

 I used planet CCRMA's apt repository, to dl and install their package
of the 2.4.19 kernel with some sound patches (low latency, etc.)
and their versions of the ALSA Packages. alsaconf is great, but I still
had to edit /rtc/modules.conf, and the halt and init scripts. Its
someting with the wat redhat 8 nloads modules at boot. But It works
great once configured.
 Oh, I know what id was: disabling the oss drivers in rh 8.0 can be a
bit tricky
But then, I'm relatively new, this probably is very simple for someone
who has alot of command-line linux experience

Subject: [PLUG] Network popup message on Linux?
Message-ID: <18930.12.47.207.251.1049143144.squirrel@webmail.pdxlug.org>

In Windows you can send a popup message to everyone in a domain/workgroup.
 For example, a window would popup and say, "Please logout of the file
server."

Does anyone have a suggestion on how this could be done for Linux clients?
 In addition, if this could also be initiated from a Windows client, that
would be useful.  We have a mixed Windows/Linux environment so ideally I'd
like to be able to send messages both ways.
Thanks,

Sorry for not reminding David in time.  It's called:

  "Teaching 'Learning Perl"

It's about 45 minutes or so on what I've learned over the years in
giving hundreds of presentations about Perl.  Not very much Perl
content, but lots of info about doing presentations -- useful for
those of you who are tapped for future PLUG meetings.  And it's funny.
I'll take Q&A at the end about presentations, Perl, my new Alpaca
book, or anything else I can answer.

We do this sometimes to let us know when programs are finished on the
servers (unix). It's not too hard from unix-to-unix or from
windows-to-unix, but unix-to-windows or windows-to-windows might be
problematic.

>From Windows to Linux is easy:

set up the Linux x servers to accept tcp connections (get rid of the
default on most linux installs of -nolisten tcp), and set up your xhost
properties to allow connections from the localhost with a specific user
(you'll probably want to create a special user on the linux boxes so
that it is a bit harder to abuse and so you can add an environment
variable "DISPLAY=:0.0" in the login scripts), and then when you want to
send a message to a box, you can use any command line ssh program (there
are several for windows) to do this:

ssh messageuser at linuxclient xmessage <message>

You can use the xmessage options or run another program if you want
(hey, you could have xeyes pop up when you did something wrong! =) to
customize what it looks like. This works from linux-to-linux and from
windows-to-linux, but for linux-to-windows you'll need to figure out a
way to run a) an ssh server, b) a program from the command line that
pops up a message, etc.

Also, if you generate sshkeys you can script this so that you can have
it autogenerate messages.

My goal was to collect as much information as I could about the bug
before posting it.  When I was on p5p it was sad to see just how much
time was spent saying, upgrade, read the release notes, RTFM, and so
on.  As it turns out, someone on p5p had already encountered and
submitted a patch for it, so my posting to perlbug didn't help much
anyway.

I've been on the pdx.pm mailing list for years (~3), and since the
emails about not wanting to do user support/RTFM/newbie q's there
hasn't been more than a handful of emails asking for help with simple
code or bugs.

Don't you think I didn't consider writing to pdx.pm about this?  Why
not ask the likes of chromatic and schwern, who do presentations about
Perl testing?  Or yourself and Tom Phoenix, or Ovid, or Ingy?  (None of
the other posters are slackers, either)  I've been part of p5p,
comp.lang.perl and comp.lang.perl.*, and just joined perlmonks.  pdx.pm
is the only online user community I've found who, at its inception,
decided not to do general user support.

At the time there were maybe 5 or 6 of us, I don't even think you'd
joined yet, and it was the height of the comp.lang.perl.misc flames
about how to deal with newbies.  (RTFM, flamage, helpfulness, or
whatever)  People were concerned about being buried with newbie
questions and lowering the signal to noise ratio to the point where the
mailing list wasn't useful.

It was a decision that I didn't (and don't) like, but respect.  And I'd
grant you that pdx.pm has changed a lot since it was created.  I went
back through the email archives, and have found a few questions (1 or 2
per month), but most of the traffic is notices about OSCON, the
programming reading group, meetings, social meetings, visits, buying
and writing books, and so on, but not many, if any, asking for help
about core programming issues instead of application level stuff.

If you want to read some real FUD, please go check out the recent
Computer Bits article about PHP and Perl.

Colin

p.s. I'd love to show you the emails, but it was way back when
majordomo was used and I don't have the emails in my own archive.  I
realize that that's too convenient an excuse, so if you can find the
emails and show me that I'm wrong, I'll apologize.

I'm sorry if you took it that way. It wasn't intended that way. I was simply pointing out that UIDs are (to my knowledge, which has been known to be in error before) always stored, and the OS does the translation. 

We all make mistakes, and sometimes, someone knows more than either of us. :)

Message-ID: <APEBIDJLFPLCNAAOMMIAEEDBDOAA.wamorita@hevanet.com>

Guys,

I had to leave Portland to take work in Sacramento, CA.  I've been stuck on
a SCO 3.2 5.0.5 system that has no compiler.  I am looking for binaries
compiled for that version of SCO.

Specifically I am seeking the following binaries:
  a.. samba (a recent version)
  b.. gcc
  c.. glib
  d.. emacs
  e.. gmake
Additional GNU items would be nice.

Thanks in advance.

Additionally, SCO (who are they now?) used to have a skunkworks CD
(mirrored on FTP) of pre-built stuff presumably by SCO engineers.
Is that now gone?

  Long ago I knew where the system stored the version of glib that it thinks
is installed. I just built glib-2.2, and ran ldconfig, but ./configure still
finds a glib-1.2 version, too. I no longer know just this information is

I memory serves me correctly, 5.0.5 predates Caldera buying out SCO, which
then began things like "skunkware".  I will give the binaries a try through.

skunkware predates Caldera if I recall correctly.

WinPopup messages are part of the smb protocol, and are limited to
1600 bytes in length.  From Linux to Windows, you can use the -M
switch to `smbclient'.  See the message command parameter in the
smb.conf(5) for a description of how to handle incoming WinPopup
messages in Samba.
