  Just to close off this thread with a nice ribbon and bow, the misconnected
end was on the drive. Over the past two decades, it seems to me, pin 1 on
floppy and hard drives were always toward the outside; the edge with the
power connector.

  Well, closer inspection of the new drive revealed 1) the connector has a
notch on both top and bottom and 2) the power socket is in the middle, not
the outer edge. Pin 1 is still adjacent to the power socket. But, in my rush
to reassemble the box with a new power supply last weekend, I put the
striped edge of the data cable to the outside. With the socket notch on top
it slid right in.

  Reversing that end (the mobo end has a notch on only one side and that was
properly seated) fixed the problem.

  Double notches, imagine! Sheesh!

I'm not sure, I never paid them directly (it was always somebody else in
the group who paid, then I paid them back) but I *think* it was ten
cents per page.  It may have been fifteen cents, though.  I think you
saved money by going double-sided.

Rob,

  Your response implies that I don't need to feed coins into the machine.
That was the reason I asked even though I wasn't clear. If I don't need a
pocket full of dimes then I can probably pay with paper or plastic.

Many thanks,

Rich

Also, depending on the journal and article, these days people in
libraries spend a lot less time awkwardly mashing heavily-bound
journal backissues against copier glass.  Investigate online full-text
versions of the articles.  Then you can either print it directly there
or email yourself a copy which you can print at home.  Full-text
"databases" aren't free, but academic libraries often pay the
subscriptions and you can get access there.  Because of the state of
copyright today and the insanity of the current scientific publishing
system, there is a whole backstory to this (google "serials crisis").

And BTW, Multnomah County Library has access to a lot of "online
full-text databases" that aren't-free-to-them-but-that-are-free-to-
library-card-holders.  Probably not a lot of scientific journals there
though.  One of the cool ones is the Historical NY Times.  With a
library card number, you can even get access from home.  See:

Russell,

  This occurred to me. I was sent the URL to an article I should read but
it's only available to us non-subscribers for $30 (for a 20-page article).
I'd rather spend the time and $2 copying charge (perhaps $3) than $1.50 per
page.

  I probably read a good part of that collection since I grew up in NYC and
we subscribed to the Times on a daily basis. :-)

  However, my immediate need is for an article in "Environmental Impact
Assessment Review". The only libraries in Oregon that stock it are PSU, OSU,
UofO and the Lewis & Clark Law Library.

Thanks,

Rich

<sigh> so many complicated solutions. Why not just run 'xhost -' to 
disable X authentication temporarily, run your installer as root, then 
run 'xhost +' to re-enable it?

I haven't tried installing firefox myself, so I'm curious... are you 
saying the installer won't work in a text console, and has to have
a working X display?

John,

  Yes. It's a gui app with a gui installer.

  I'd install it as a user but it cannot find xpistub even though
libxpistub.so exists. The library path is not in the user $PATH so it cannot
find it. I may just copy the library to /lib and let it go at that.

If it's just the installer giving you grief, why don't you just compile
it from source?  It'll probably take an hour or two - but how many hours
have you wasted trying to get the installer to work properly and then
the precompiled binary to find its necessary components?

You could try the archies without the installer.  It is available on the 
releases page.  The install involves unpacking the archive wherever you 
want it installed.  You might need to do some hacking to get 
/usr/bin/firefox pointing the right place.

Rob,

  Oh, ... perhaps 0.143 hours. :-) Doesn't take long for it to decide it
cannot find the library or come up with another excuse for not working.

Fedora Core 2 doesn't need it.  It uses a PAM entry in /etc/pam.d/su:

session    optional     /lib/security/$ISA/pam_xauth.so

It looks like pam_xauth.so copies the current cookie and sets XAUTHORITY 
to /root/.xauth7zFzsf (last 6 chars are random).

The old standby is to set XAUTHORITY to the .Xauthority of the user 
running the X server.  Doing 'su -' should leave the XAUTHORITY 
environment variable.

But with a lot of down time in between smaller chunks of time...

Locally-compiled applications are far less likely to not find a library
on your system they need... or if they do, they just won't compile in
the first place.

I just discovered it is possible to allow access to local clients:

xhost local:

Much safer than opening up access to everybody.  Although, many 
distributions run X without network access.

Interesting; I'd not noticed that before.  I rarely run X apps through
su, preferring instead to use 'sudo'.

You may find that it's free if you can find someone to use the
computer lab there for you, as the on-campus IP's are authorized to
several journal databases.

I'm currently using Goldmine[1] to manage clients, track activities such
as calls and appointment, forecasting sales and mass mailing. I would
like to replace Goldmine with an OSS project that does the same thing.
I'm looking at Anteil[2] but other projects are possible.

I'm wondering if anyone is using Anteil or have experience doing something
similar. Incidently, this has opened up a position at my work. Please see
my post to plug-jobs for more details.

Sorry, no.  But I'm looking for similar software, for donor-management
at nonprofits.  I'll be curious to see if CRM s/w can be adapted to the
purpose.

Right.  And (I am not sure about PSU) I think it fairly likely that
the public access terminals there have access too.  They do at the
academic library where my wife works.

As badly as libraries get screwed (or are putting themselves in a
position to be screwed), a stand-alone user contacting a public
fee-based website is likely to get screwed even worse.

If it was published within the last 12 months, they (PSU Library) have
it online and you can probably email yourself the PDF and print it at
home.  Otherwise, you are probably back to mashing cumbersome bound
back-issues against the copier glass.  Ah, the wonders of modern
technology in the hands of capitalist-monopolists.

I wonder why I keep humming the theme to "Brazil"?

I should clarify, you'll still have to be *at* PSU to get access to
the database to mail it to yourself, so this doesn't save you a trip
from Troutdale, but it would save you paying for copies and getting
smeared ones and/or with missing or illegible words near the margins.

FWIW.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0408012301010.13723@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

    My wife still has one Microsoft Word application that prevents
her from converting to Linux, and totally ridding our home of all
that is Microsoft.  Please help me.

    Here is the application.  She creates booklets from 8.5"x11"
paper.  They are printed in landscape mode and folded in the center
to create booklets that are stapled in the center.  This is easy
in Microsoft Word.  You simply tell Word how many pages are in the 
booklet (it must be a multiple of 4), and Word does the rest of the
work.  For example in a 36 page booklet, page 2 will be printed on the 
left and page 35 will be on the right of a single landscape page.  
This should be equally easy in Open Office, but I don't see the feature.
Is it there?  Where is it?  HELP RID OUR HOME OF MICROSOFT.


                                          Sincerely,

Jack,

  For the past umpteen years I've used my Palm PDA with the DateBk addon for
much of the similar things. I have a record of all contacts with prospects
and clients (using the addressbook, databook and memos) and I can see the
to-do list with the daily schedule. It won't forcast sales (but there's
probably an Ouija board application for the Palm that would work as well as
a random number generator <g>), but you can export records for use in a mail
merge.

  I like this system because it both works for my needs and it's highly
portable. For that matter, using the Kyocera QCP-6035 cell phone/Palm OS PDA
is even more useful as I have -- in a single unit -- all phone numbers and
contact records.

  Just another thought for consideration.

Rich

David,

  Send a completely empty e-mail to 'user-subscribe at openoffice.org'. After
confirming your subscription request, ask the experts there. I'm sure it can
be done and you will get the details on where it's hidden on the menus and
help system.

It's there, but is mislabeled as "enable brochure" under "options" in 
the print dialog.

  Or, check 'printing -> presentation brochures' on the help menu.

Subject: [PLUG] Fedora Core 2 Postfix Problems
Message-ID: <410E5F0D.5000009@comcast.net>

I'm having some problems setting up Postfix using Fedora Core 2.  I've 
attached the maillog and main.cf file so that you can see my settings 
and the problems we are having.  Basically I have two problems right now.

The first problem is that the server does not not store messages.  I can 
send a message to the outside world but just fine but when sending mail 
to a user on the server I get the following error:

Aug  2 08:02:58 nclackmail postfix/pipe[5063]: B9C44467BF: 
to=<salyers at nclackmai
l.nclack.k12.or.us>, relay=cyrus, delay=0, status=bounced (data format 
error. Co
mmand output: salyers: Mailbox does not exist )

The second problem is that I can not connect to the mail server to check 
for mail.  I've tried Eudora 5.1 and the latest version of Mozilla 
Thunderbird.  Here is the error I get when I attemp to connect.

Aug  2 07:43:31 nclackmail pop3[1860]: badlogin:

SASL(-13)
: user not found: could not find password

Any ideas what's going wrong here?  I need to get this server 
functioning by the end of this month so any help is greatly appreciated.

Thank You

Could you show us your master.cf also?

Looks like you're delivering to Cyrus-IMAPd. Do you have the lmtp section  
uncommented in /etc/postfix/master.cf?

Is saslauthd running? Is it authenticating against PAM or LDAP or 
something else?

We're running a similar setup so shoot me an e-mail if you get in a jam.

Since that time, I added a Radeon 9200 AGP card, and
now Mandrake 10 supports the motherboard fully. An
unexpected benefit to this Linux release is that you
can put LILO in the boot sector and Windows XP will
still boot. (So, you don't have to use a third-party
boot loader if you also use XP.) For the present,
then, I think I'll continue to use Mandrake.

I still have lots of unused disk space, so I am
willing to try releases suggested by anyone else.

I have got some little twits knocking on the door of one of my servers 
trying to make ssh connections.  It is irritating as all hell seeing the 
attempts in my system/security logs so I figured after I report them to
the company where the IPs look to be from I'd like to just not even give 
them an answer when they knock.  I know I can do this using iptables and 
friends but I'd prefer in these few instances to do it (hopefully) using 
sshd configurations. 

Ideas?

This is a script.  There has been a lot of noise on the security lists 
about it.  They are looking for stupid username/password combinations.  
(For the moment.)  If they get in, they root the server via a couple of 
receint kernel exploits.  It appears they are using compromised servers 
for the attacks.

You will want to inform the holders of the ip addresses that they may have 
a compromised server.

As for local solutions, you should be able to restrict access to sshd via 
/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny.  Unless, of course, your users are 
coming from non-fixed-ip addresses in the first place...

Rod,

  Please let me know what you learn. I've had an increase in cracking
attempts over the past couple of weeks, all trying ssh. Almost all are from
Asia so I don't waste my time reporting the incidents. I've not received any
acknowledgements from IP addresses in the US or Europe so I don't know if
it's worth the time to report 'em. They don't get in, but it _is_ annoying.

Thanks,

Rich

Alan,

  I restrict access to specific usernames. Can't define the IP addresses
because they are dynamically allocated by hotels' ISPs.

First off, run SSH on a non-standard port, like maybe 20022 or
something.  Just change the line that starts with "Port" in your
sshd_config file.  That will stop most of the automated scripts.

Next, you can restrict SSH access to certain user names and IP
addresses with this line:

AllowUsers roderick

or...

AllowUsers roderick at 1.2.3.4

No, it's in sshd_config.  Possibly in /etc/ssh/sshd_config or wherever
SSH was installed.

Note about e-mailing it to yourself. PSU is now blocking all outbound
SMTP connections except those from known IP addresses (mainly the
mailservers). Tremendous anti-spam step, but depending upon your method
of sending it to yourself you'll have problems.

Bringing along a USB fob, CD-R(W), or (gasp!) a floppy might be your best
approach.

amavisd-new 2.0 (aka 20040701) is supposed to be backwards-compatible
with the configuration from (at least) p10, and probably p7.  The only
new requirement that I can think of is BerkeleyDB Perl module.

I have.  For others information the three domains yesterday were gte.net,

These are servers and myself from three or four different locations and 
one other person from the same number of locations are the only ones that 
access via ssh.

There was an article in System Admin Magazine several months ago on an 
obfuscated aceess method called port-knocking.  I'm thinking of trying it.

Anyone here hear of it or tried it?

Within sshd, AllowUsers or AllowGroups are probably the best choices, as
already mentioned.

I use hosts.allow and hosts.deny. Here's my hosts.deny line. I'm not
posting the hosts.allow stuff, but I could get rid of the 'except'
clause here if I wanted to. The '10.' netblock is my back net; there are
a pile of public IPs in the hosts.allow file starting with the netblocks
in use on my network, static addresses that my users connect from, and a
couple of client sites in case I get locked out (like if my home
'static' IP changes because of a network screwup). 

sshd: all except 10.9.8.0/24

Heard of it. Very silly idea, but I suppose it does work.

Typically the way this works is that you ask the database to email it,
so outbound SMTP blocking at the library won't be an issue.

Yes it should.  Since I'm forced into using PuTTY on a Windows system at 
work I'll see if it works with high range ports.

Works well.  The down side is it still answers the door and asks for a
password. (ssh roderick at myhost.mydomain.com).  Of course this means a 
Rumpelstiltskin attack is more difficult.

Subject: [PLUG] Hate to bother everyone, but I'm in a laptop bind...
Message-ID: <1091485293.16408.19.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I looked at the iBook at CompUSA out at Jantzen beach and I
have to say despite it not being a PC that it would probably
fit me better than my Inspiron 5100 Dell.  It's only six months
old.  I got it to run maple, Redhat version.  Why use Linux?  
The XP version of maple locks up frequently.  That and the 
fact that I'd rather program in a Unix environment than a 
Windows one.  I haven't actually tried the XP version of
maple on this Dell.

How can I sell this machine for anything if I can't transfer
the license?  One outfit suggested that I put it to factory
default so that I can get any hardware problems fixed.  I
doubt it has any hardware problems.  How am I supposed to 
put it to factory settings though?  I'd imagine that a 
Dell certified shop can do that.  

I emailed Dell customer support with the problem, but I get
the sense that I'm probably going to be on my own here.

It's an Inspiron 5100 

    The          service tag is: 3WWPL41
    The Express Service Code is: 8520206113

I tried to use the service tag, make, and model to get 
hardware information.  The modem wasn't included in the 
information I found, though I don't need to support it.    
The information wasn't very good though.  It looks like
ATI made a custom video card for it.

If anyone wants to look at the information in hopes of
coming up with good compatibility advice I think you
can go to Dell.com.  You probably have to have my 
login though.

Is there a Linux on Dell business in the Portland area
that can do professional installation work?

What about using iptables or at your router?

I use IPCOP, which seems to be pretty good
at filtering.

When I first read your problem description I thought of how implementing
the concept of port knocking in reverse would be a partial solution.

The daemon would watch your logs, see the ssh login attempt with user test
and then insert a iptables rule blocking port 22 from the source of that 
connection attempt.  

As to the technique of port knocking itself there have been articles
all over the place on it, the top three Google hits today are:

Yeah I hadn't done any recent research and now realize I was confused as I 
remember an article in SysAdminMag but all the hoopla that the LJ article 
has had got me wondering.

My only concern right now, without doing more research, is how to do it
from a Windows client.  A real scripting language or two makes it easy in
the UNIX/Linux world.  Windows is nother matter.  The may already be tools 
for this.

Type in "about:config" in the address bar (where you'd normally type
an url) and press enter.

  Aha! I think that I must have used a period rather than a colon when I
tried that. This time it worked.

I am not clear on what you want to do. Are you wanting to see your old 
Dell?  

If you are trying to return it to "factory default" you probably have to 
reinstall the OS through some sort of system reinstall utility.

I am just not clear as to your goal...

Is localhost in /etc/hosts?  If not, the browser is being perfectly
reasonable.  What happens when you try e.g.
http://127.0.0.1/sql-ledger/admin.pl ?

Sure, there are consultants.  There are also folks who do it for free,
like at the Linux Clinics.  No Dell-specific ones that I'm aware of, but
Dells are pretty common and *mostly* easy to support.

You seemed to be implying a lot more questions with all that verbiage
and info.  If so, please check all that apply:

[] How do I get Red Hat Linux running reliably on my Inspiron 5100?

   return it to its original condition as shipped from Dell?

[] Is there a way to transfer the (Maple?) license to someone else?
   (Note: this can best be answered by the vendor, not the PLUG list.)

[] How can I get better assistance from Dell Support?

[] Is there another distro that'll run Maple and work better on my Dell?

I either want to stabilize the Redhat with maple, or try to get the
money out of it.  It looks like the stock 2.4.20-8 kernel from Redhat
may be stable without the power management enabled.  It would be nice to
get the sound keys working too.  You're supposed to be able to use
lineakd under debian, but I don't know that I can get that to work in
Redhat.  I researched the laptop, to my horror though I have 
discovered that what's in it is not necessarily the same as  
the hardware in 5100 Inspirons manufactured prior.  For Windows 
if Dell tweaks software drivers, fine.  For Linux though, 
not all hardware is created equal.  Especially true where Dell isn't 
offering a Linux laptop anymore, let alone full hardware 
information.  I tried to call Dell about putting the laptop in a
factory state and perhaps taking it to a Dell certified shop for
that, but I didn't get any real information.  After six months,
I wonder if there's even any chance of taking it back.

I wish I even knew what the source of the lock ups is.  If it's the
power management, turning it off, although inconvenient, would patch 
the problem for now.  My advice to anyone wanting to put Linux on a
laptop is to seriously consider an: iBook, Toshiba, or Thinkpad 
before ever looking at a Dell.  Is there a clinic I can bring it 
to?  I need to get prolog on it if I can.  

If money weren't an issue, I'd try a $10k Sun system laptop like my
brother-in-law's.  Paying $500 extra for a Linux Certified, Toshiba, 
or Thinkpad laptop is worth it.  The iBook is in the same price range 
as an Inspiron 5100, but the screen is only 1024x768.  I don't think 
the iBook has even one pc card slot.  However, they're light, cool,
whisper quiet, and small.  My older brother got one and is trying to
familiarize with it now.  An Apple is probably the best buy right 
now for a portable.

To clarify, I would need to transfer the licenses on the software
bundled with the Dell.  I bought the Maple from school under a student
purchase plan unafilliated with Dell.

> [] How can I get better assistance from Dell Support?

Now that is a good question ;-)

> [] Is there another distro that'll run Maple and work better on my Dell?

I put gentoo on there, but I'm at a loss getting the graphical part of
the Maple software working.  I've run into some gotchas with sound too.
Sound working would be nice, but if it doesn't crash the machine 
I can at least deal with that.

Probably, but that's the expensive route and a pipe dream in the
immediate future.

Indeed.  I have heard, "run it in VESA mode and use the CPU power."

Couldn't have said it better.

Okay, I'm soft blocking this way too many times.  The one to=abuse at bedboxsale.com line is me trying to inform the domain owners of bedboxsale.com that someone
else may be using their domain posing as them. I sent the domain owners, hopefully, 
much of the information above.

I think this is an example of postfix's reject_unknown_hostname under smtpd_recipient_restrictions.

What I'd like to implement is, 
"any helo address soft blocked three times because the ip doesn't match should be hard blocked for the next n days." 

Does that sound reasonable?

Ok - dumb question - do I just do a regular build like I would a first

amavisd-new 2.0 (aka 20040701) is supposed to be backwards-compatible
with the configuration from (at least) p10, and probably p7.  The only
new requirement that I can think of is BerkeleyDB Perl module.

Dell has never really specialized in having certified technicians in a
"shop".  They are, primarily, a mail order company.  Their shop is
somewhere in Texas.  Their service system has worked fairly well for
them that when there's a hardware problem, they dispatch their chosen
service vendor, and they replace broken parts.

For software restore - you should have received with the laptop a
system restore CD, and it should be trivial to put that in, boot off
it, and restore the laptop to 'factory state'.

If you do not have the system restore CD - then hopefully Dell still
stocks them, and you can perhaps buy a replacement.

amavisd is just a Perl script; it doesn't need to be compiled.

two quick guesses would be that the webserver (apache?) is not running or 
there are firewall rules in place.

Does "netstat -an | grep -i listen" show anything like 127.0.0.1:80 or 
similar?

What does Debian set the permissions for the file /var/log/secure to? From

There is no such log by default. The entire logging structure differs
from RedHat systems in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.

Huh.  Sounds like Apache isn't running, or is blocked.  Does your
/etc/hosts.allow have a line like, "www: ALL" or "www: 127.0.0.1/32"?
What happens when you do a "telnet localhost 80"?

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0408031221370.11193@well.com>

Hi:

I am trying to simulate a disk drive failure in order to
ensure that a raid array will still continue to operate.

Do any of you know of a way to force an IDE disk drive
offline? This is under debian sarge.

Of course, I can simply remove the IDE connector, but
I don't want to risk damaging the hardware.

I thought of using dd to write garbage onto a particular
disk drive, but I fear that doing this may not be good
for the drives either and it does not realy simulate losing
a drive.

Thank you all

Mark Allyn

... and services linked against libwrap, which I'm sure Apache could
be. (And sshd often is, fwiw.)

Keith,

  I'm using thttpd, not apache's httpd. Is it running? I don't know. There's
no pid for it, but running -- again -- /etc/rc.d/init.d/thttpd start returns
"OK".

  Would the firewall rules -- no a different box -- affect me connecting
internally to a Web server?

Aaron,

  Not running apache, but thttpd.

  Just added www: ALL to /etc/hosts.allow. No difference.

  When I tried to access http://localhost/sql-ledger/admin.pl I discovered
that keyword.enabled had been reset to "true" from false. This keeps
happening; how do I set it to false permanently? Apparently changing it and
clicking the OK button does nothing.

  Cannot telnet to localhost:80.

  On the floppyfw, port 80 is closed. Am I wrong that the firewall is not
involved in an internal-internal connection?

Thanks,

Rich

In any case Rich, check your netstat:


>> Does "netstat -an | grep -i listen" show anything like 127.0.0.1:80 or
>> similar?

> tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8000          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN


8000 does not equal 80  

Aaron was prompting to you check for and hopefully find something like:

  tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN

But you're listening on port 8000 instead of 80.

Try:

  Telnetting to port 8000
  Configuring your app to connect to port 8000

  Nope. Nothing on 80.

  Works.

>   Configuring your app to connect to port 8000

  I changed /etc/thttpd.conf to use port 8000 instead of the default 80.
Lemme' restart thttpd and see if that fixes the problem ...

  Sigh. Something strange is going on with the http daemon. Here's what I
see:

[root at salmo ~/]# rc.d/init.d/thttpd restart
Gently shutting down thttpd: thttpd is not running         [FAILED]
Starting thttpd:                                           [  OK  ]

  The daemon _had_ been running before I shut down the box to fix the floppy
connector this past Sunday. I don't know why the start command -- which
reports "OK" -- results in the daemon not running. Guess I need to fix this
problem first.

Thanks,

Rich

I have a Dell 5150 that is running SuSE 9.0 professional and I have no 
problems with any lockups and everything expect the Dell TrueMobile 1300 
WiFI card. For WIFI I had to use the LinuxAnt driver loader and use 
Broadcom's Windows drivers. I have an NVidia 5200 GeForce and the NVidia 
drivers are great for 3D. The box is more stable with Linux than with 
WinXP. With that said the company I work for has had a near 100% failure 
rate with these 5150s. There appears to be a problem with the charger 
circuit and eventually the system will not power on anymore and the fix 
has been to have a new motherboard installed in the laptops.

Do you have to run RedHat?  I know I've been able install a few RPM 
packages that were for Red Hat but they ran without any issues under 
SuSE since I had all of the necessary libraries installed. I suppose it 
helps that SuSE uses RPMs for packaging their software as well.

Last but  not least did you try looking at Google and see how other 
users have faired with the Dell 5100:

Verify that the daemon is indeed not running with an appropriate ps 
command.

If it really is running, it may not be starting upon boot.

Also, you do realize that if you configure the daemon to use port 8000, 
you have to tell the browser to use that port for http explicitly...

i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8000/sql-ledger/admin.pl

Oops. I meant unplug the power connector. Do not unplug the interface
cable.

Depends on the kernel - if you are running 2.4.22 or higher,
( uname -r ) then you can do an  " hdparm -b0 /dev/hd[X]" ,
which will unmount the drive from the bus, and tristate it
(which permits removing the connector, too!).   Return the
drive with " hdparm -zb1 /dev/hd[X] ".

This feature has not made it into the 2.6.X series of kernels,
AFAICS.   I looked in the changelogs for 2.6 on Kernel.org and
haven't seen anything yet.  (I would *love* to be proved wrong. 
Alan Cox promised May, but I have not seen it).

Russ,

  What's strange is that 'ps ax' shows no thttpd. But, 'less
/var/run/thttpd.pid' shows 15545.

  After reading the thttpd Web site again everything here looks correct. So,
I just did the following:

/etc/rc.d/init.d/thttpd stop	# failed as the daemon is not running
/etc/rc.d/init.d/thttpd start   # returned "OK"
ps ax				# no thttpd found; pid = 15784
cat /var/run/thttpd.pid		# shows 15780

  What may be happening here? It looks to me that the start command invokes
the daemon long enough to write the assigned process number to
/var/run/thttpd.pid, then the process dies so I cannot find it in the
process list immediately after starting it.

  Guess I need to subscribe to the thttpd mail list and ask there.

> If it really is running, it may not be starting upon boot.

  It ain't starting -- and remainin up manually.

  What's interesting is that when I use this URL (but with localhost instead
of the IP address), I load a blank page.

Yup, that's the problem with using .pid files. The startup script 
"succeeds", starts the process, and writes the .pid file, then the 
process dies.

That sounds like your process is running, or something else is answering 
on port 8000.

Can you telnet to port 8000? Do you get any response when you do? Press 
enter a few times...

When you think the process has died, does the netstat command still show 
something listening on port 8000?

If so, do you have any proxies running?

I would suggest looking at the thttpd error log to see if there are any 
clues. Apache often gives me similar behavior with a config error and 
the log usually gives a hint. From the thttpd man file,  the daemon 
uses the normal syslog function, so check the normal /var/log/messages 
file unless you specified differently.

Subject: [PLUG] move preview pane to left in openoffice Impress
Message-ID: <1091622296.7100.6.camel@localhost.localdomain>

In 1.1.0-16 (redhat) the preview pane while in outline mode, in Impress
is on the right

In 1.1.2 (downloaded) it is on the left.

Seems minor, but its annoying.  

I cannot seem to get the preview to move.  It can float it, but it is
still anchored to the left.  I can change its size, hide it, or get rid
of it, but not "move" it.

I am running FC2.

Interestingly, it is also stuck to the top and bottom, so that in
floating mode, it does not shrink its canvas to fit.

  A reply to my message on the thttpd mail list suggested that I invokd the
daemon directly (/usr/sbin/thttpd) rather than through the init scripts.
Well, ... that works! Process 7099 is now happily sitting there, suspended,
with the fully-qualified path shown in the list. Of course,
/var/run/thttpd.pid has the wrong value, but I've no idea what that file
does in the grand scheme of things anyway.

  Yes, I can. Here:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ telnet localhost 8000
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1).
Escape character is '^]'.

The last two lines occurred after I pressed [Enter].

  Squid.

  Just now, with the process running I tried (from within firefox)
'http://localhost:8000/sql-ledger/admin.pl' and I get a blank page with
'done' in the status bar.

Is thttpd capable of running perl scripts and accessing a postgresql
database?  Are these features turned on?

Just wondering.

about this.  I'm pretty sure one can do it.  I just don't know how.

Dave,

  There is the option on the print menu, but I don't know if that
reorganizes the pages. The experts on the OO.o users list have the answer.

Good luck!

OK, that sounds like the same results you got when we're pretty sure 
thttpd wasn't running. If you get the same results both with thttpd 
running and without it running, AND something else is listening on port 
8000 when thttpd isn't running. You can't have two processes listening 
on the same port.

I'd check the logs (as suggested by Derek) and try a different port 
(8001?) You can do a netstat to find an unused port to use.

  I've forgotten the wrapper for files inadvertently created with a leading

searches are not properly formed for they do not produce a result.

  How do I 'rm -filename' or 'mv -filename filename'?

Use "--" it tells GNU getopt() to stop parsing switches.

rm -- -filename

rm /full/path/to/-filename

Or, if you're in the directory with the offending file:

rm ./-filename

Hmmm... this is going to be another infamous perl centric answer since
I don't know how to do it in shell:

perl -e 'unlink "-filename";'

perl -e 'rename "-filename", "filename";'

Or, use the attached ren script to rename the file using a perl expression

ren 's/-//;' *

Subject: [PLUG] Setting up dual boot with linux/NTFS.
Message-ID: <20040804194902.25881.qmail@web52704.mail.yahoo.com>

I have a desktop system with XP home installed.  I want to install the
20 gig hard drive from my old system in it and install Fedora and/or
SuSE on it. 

I'm trying to decide which drive should be the master and which should
be the slave.

If I leave the current NTFS drive as master, is there ANY chance that
grub will mess up the drive?  I'd rather not have to reinstall/restore
all my stuff (and more importantly, my wife's stuff).

If I make the Linux drive the master, I'll have to take the NTFS drive
out and change the jumpers and I assume it will boot up slower.

Also, does anybody have advice for setting up partitions?  Are there
any guidelines for how big to make /, /bin, /var, /opt, etal.?

What I usually do is install on the second drive, with the XP drive as 
master.

Install grub/lilo as normal, in the MBR of the master drive.

Now, if you want to remove linux and restore you MBR to a "Windows only" 
state, restore the MBR as outlined here: 
http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/Windows/XP/all/reskit/en-us/Default.asp?url=/resources/documentation/Windows/XP/all/reskit/en-us/prkd_tro_ldau.asp

Beside the fixmbr command, another good command to know is fixboot.

Hope that helps.

Russ

Russ,

  Reading /var/log/messages I learned that thttpd fired up listening to port
80. So I changed the config file, killed and restarted the process and tried
accessing the admin.pl page. Now the server responds with a 500 error:

"500 Internal Error
There was an unusual problem serving the requested URL '/sql-ledger/admin.pl'.

thttpd/2.25b 29dec2003"

  Progress!

  The sql-ledger FAQ says;

"The requested URL /sql-ledger/admin.pl was not found

"Your webserver doesn't know where to find the script. Most commonly this is
from distributions hiding webserver configuration files in different
locations or files and setup.pl wasn't able to configure the location for
you. Find out which file (httpd.conf, httpdcommon.conf, ...) controls your
webserver configuration and add

   # SQL-Ledger
   Include /etc/httpd/sql-ledger-httpd.conf"

  When I did this and started thttpd, it complained about not understanding
'Include'. That's when I put the line in /etc/thttpd.conf, but there's also
/usr/local/www/thttpd_config. (Note to Wil: I don't think apache is easier
than this little guy; I became equally befuddled when I tried installing
that.)

  Now I don't know if it's a thttpd error or a sql-ledger error. But, I
would like to believe that I'm getting closer.

Thanks,

The sql-ledger install assumes you're running apache. Does thttpd use
the same config files and document directory location/structure? If
not, you're not going to get very far without hand editing the server
files.

I've heard of problems with Fedora 2 messing up the
partition table. It's always a good idea to have a
backup, of course, even if you only do things that are
reasonably safe.

Windows doesn't like it if it doesn't control the MBR.  Especially XP.

I have had extremely good luck with my set up at home. 

It is as follows: 

1 160 GB HDD: Primary master; Mandrake Linux
2 40 GB HDD: Primary Slave; Windows XP Pro

Here is how I went about doing it:
I started out with a completed install of Windows XP. 
I installed the 160 GB HDD as Primary Master, I changed the Windows XP HDD
to Primary Slave
I installed Mandrake to the Primary Master.

When I got to where I had to configure my partitions I DID NOT EVEN TOUCH my
Windows Xp HDD
(Understand that Mandrake has GUI for this part, not sure about anything
else.)

Then when it came time to set up the boot menu, it detected the fact that I
had XP on the other HDD. A healthy exploration of the menus may be in order.
Just don't change anything you aren't sure of.

On boot, it find the Primary master HDD boot sector, and runs LILO. If
windows is the choice, then it passes control over to the other HDD and
Windows is none the wiser.

I've had this configuration for the last few years and it has worked like a
dream.. 

Naturally, in any major upgrade / change like this it'd be a good idea to
backup at least the files you want to keep.

Much to my surprise other flavors of getopt() as well. I tend to prefer
./-filename as it will work with programs that don't use getopt().

Good thing others answered first. The above will inhibit _shell_ parsing,
not parsing by the program itself.


There is always the option:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
	remove("-filename");
	return 0;
}

The only issue I regard as important for partitioning is make sure
your "/var" and "/tmp" are on a partition with enough space.

And, "enough space" means "enough for your intended uses", of course?
In general, I do a small /boot, a ~4 Gig /, and a very large /usr.

Mandrake 10's LILO will not interfere with the
operation of XP, though I do not know about the
performance of other distros. If Linux overwrites the
MBR and XP doesn't boot, fixmbr will probably restore
its operation, though some other method will have to
be used to boot Linux. I've heard, however, that some
OS' modify the partition table in such a way that
fixmbr will not restore XP's functioning.

"Mandrakeworks" on Ebay is offering Mandrake 10
Powerpack DVD's with a coffee cup for about $40,
including shipping to the Western US. It comes with a
month of support, and I didn't get the last one
offered.

John,

  I've no idea. I do know that the sql-ledger Web site states that the
program will run with any of several http servers, relational database
backends and browsers. I followed the instructions in the sql-ledger FAQ and
am now trying to learn if the problem is with thttpd or sql-ledger.

Thanks,

Rich

  Progress to report!

  On the suggestion of someone on the thttpd mail list I changed
/usr/local/www/thttpd_conf so cgipat=**.pl instead of .cgi. Killed and
restarted the daemon. Now I get a 404 Not Found error. Gotta' find where
admin.pl is and see if I can get thttpd to look there.

Excelsior!

As I said before.... look in the thttpd error logs ( look in your 
syslogd config for  where this is). This will tell you the information 
you seek. Error logs are your friends. Or you could just keep up with 
the trial and error thing if you don't value your time. :-)

Doug,

  All it tells _me_ is that it cannot find the script -- or cannot run it.

  The log in /usr/local/www/logs/ is empty.

  I also made a new directory, /usr/local/sql-ledger/firefox and copied all
the files from /usr/local/sql-ledger/mozilla to it. Then tried and received
the above.

Thanks,

So this tells me that your web server thinks that admin.pl should be in 
  /usr/local/sql-ledger/admin.pl but it can't find it there. 404 means

with that solution if you were using Apache.

Doug,

  Here's the current status: I'm getting closer now -- a 403 Forbidden
error. :-)

  SQL-ledger is installed in /usr/local/sql-ledger/. Even though I told
thttpd that its home dir=/usr/local/sql-ledger/, it still insists that it is
really /usr/local/www/data/.

  Following Kurt's suggestion, I aimed firefox at http://localhost/ and
fired. It came up at /, which is actually /usr/local/www/data because I can
see my symlink, sql-ledger, there. The link points to /usr/local/sql-ledger.

  When I clicked on the link up popped the page,

403 Forbidden
The requested URL '/sql-ledger/' resolves to a file outside the permitted
web server directory tree.

  So, thttpd _is_ running in its chroot jail (despite /var/log/messages
showing that it's not). Now I need to learn from the thttpd guys how to get
it to accept the application and run it.

Thanks,

Rich

Why don't you just move sql-ledger to /usr/local/www/data/sql-ledger? 
You may also need to change some of the files for setup to allow the web
server to write to them (I don't remember which ones), but the
directions for sql-ledger should cover that.

Good Luck,

I finally got around to trying this on a real application-- and it works
great.  The only tricky part is getting the syntax right and remembering
to link in their ptrace.c code with whatever binary is being built.

Nutshell summary:
  + edit Makefile to include "ptrace.o" as an object file
  + copy ptrace.c to source directory
  + build it with proper CFLAGS to allow function tracing
  + run "etrace.pl <main object file>" from the source dir
  + run the binary standalone in another window, also from the
    source dir.
  + The execution tree should appear in the window running etrace.pl

Really handy!

Derek,

  I tried this. Now the error is that httpd won't run the perl scripts
because they're not CGI. Sigh. In both thttpd config files is the line,
'cgipat=**.pl', which (IIUC) tells the server to run the darn perl scripts
rather than insisting on cgi scripts.

  Perhaps the most parsimonious thing to do is buy a year's support from the
Canadian group that created sql-ledger (it's $179) and get the pdf manual,
support and upgrades for a year. I'm sure that I'll have some operating
questions. After more than a decade running my business I do know what to do
with bookkeeping and financial data and can usually figure out the
ideosyncracies of each software package I've used (all in linux). I'm just a
bit frustrated that it's being as difficult as it is. Sql-ledger is supposed
to work with thttpd (and several other httpd in addition to apache) but the
directions on the FAQ are either apache-specific or missing.

Thanks,

Rich

Is there a reason that you are opposed to Apache? Unlike thttpd, there 
are a plethora of people that could resolve this for you if you would 
choose Apache. The reason that all the docs are Apache specific is that 
that is the web server most everyone chooses. They assume if you want 
to run against the herd, its b/c you are more familiar with the other 
product and can make the necessary config changes.

  Considering the time we've all spent on this, the price is quite
reasonable. A decade ago I forked over $1,000 for "Proven" which was a
horrible mistake and I've spent more than that for the Linux General Ledger
I've been running the past several years. Since this is a critical business
application I'll sign up with them and get the silly thing up and running.
Then I can spend the weekend migrating data for the first 7 months of the
year. Oh, goodie. :-)

  Thanks, all!

Doug,

  A year or so ago I installed apache and tried configuring it. Since I do
not host my own Web site here it seemed like overkill. thttpd is a very
small application and, since my only need for it is to be able to run
sql-ledger, it seems the better way to go.

  In a similar vein, having to install all of OpenOffice.org for my use of
Writer for letters and invoices is also less than elegant. I don't use any
of the other OO.o apps (I prefer XessSE for a spreadsheet, mpg for
presentations and so on) but it takes a lot of room on the hard drives --
which is not a limiting factor.

  I prefer to use the minimal tools I need. thttpd seems more appropriate to
me than does apache. Of course, I may be wrong. I'll learn more in the next
day or two.

Many thanks,

Rich

I guess it depends on how you define minimal:

* System resources-  Apache running in with very few connections takes 
up such little CPU and memory that it doesn't even register on modern 
systems. My 2 gig Athlon XP says its 100% idle even.
* File size-  pretty inconsequential given todays disk size
* Admin time- this one is debatable but you have already spent several 
days trying to figure out your "minimal" web server and I and many 
others could have gotten you working on Apache already. Plus, all your 
docs give Apache-centric examples.

Just food for thought. I think your OO.org example is more valid than 
the Apache example. OO.org consumes a great deal of system resources 
just to run and probably is overkill for word processing. I don't think 
thats the case with Apache.

problem.  Fortunately, I don't have the built in wireless installed.  
I have an Alvarion PC-DS.11b card.  I know it needs the Orinoco 
driver under Slackware or Debian.  The bios on these, is there any
way to secure the network and cdrom booting options?  Intel 
password protects hard drives.  Bios with a reflash feature 
isn't secure at all, but most laptops appear to deny the owner
a means of locking down network and cdrom booting.  What's would
work really well is requiring a device that to be plugged into 
the USB port in order for the laptop to run at all.  Otherwise,
I'll just have to watch it real closely.

Heck, if you're really desperate for every last ounce of processor and
memory resources, you can configure Apache to start out of inetd.

Doug,

  I accept your challenge. :-)

  I'll put apache on my new box (to which I'll be moving as soon as I get
the guest OS running in VMware) and install sql-ledger there, too. I
couldn't care less what httpd is running. Which apache version would you
suggest, 1.x or 2.x?

Thanks,

  Anyone here have experience and comments on using the HP JetDirect (or

I don't think running Apache out of inetd has been supported for a

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/invoking.html

Right there in the main documentation in the first paragraph of
running it on UNIX. Oh, it's not *recommended*, but I'd say it looks
pretty supported.

Sorry. That was a bit smarmy. I stand by the gist of it, though: It
may not be recommended, it may even be strongly discouraged, but to
call it unsupported is quite strong, in my opinion.

Okay, I guess it still is in 1.3, but it's removed from 2.0:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/upgrading.html

I wouldn't expect it to actually work, nor would I expect any sympathy
from Apache developers.

i have used pretty much all of the various ethernet printer devices.  The 
Jetdirect devices are expensive, but they work.  They work well and you 
don't have to muck with them.

Highly reccomended.

David,

  I see models from 300 to 610N and prices from $49 to $349. I don't know
what models work with my printers. But, if I can get a refurbished card
reasonably enough I'll go this route.

  A query has gone to a vendor asking about suitable models.

Thanks,

Rich

I am soft blocking a lot of attempts from 66.10.9x,yyy to forge someone
else's email address and send me spam.  Why does Postfix soft block 
unknown ip addresses indefinitely?

The joker is rotating ips, whoever it is must think that
they merely need to find a number I haven't blocked.  That's not the
case though, I'm blocking every unknown address.  If an IP is
predominantly abused and the only indication from it is that it's
an abusers address, I'd like to set an iptables rule to close the
smtp port to that ip.  Essentially, I'm trying to 
use the idea of port knocking in reverse.  If you knock as someone
you're not three times, every ip you knocked with will be 550 
blocked in Postfix.  If those ip's are seen three more times 
from a domain trying to forge itself, they will be iptables 
blocked for a month with a listing of all the domains they
claimed to be sending from posted to an internal web site.

If someone legit is sending from a non RFC compliant mail site:
the options are: use ISP mailboxes, call the person, 
and email the person.  Lowering the security for unknown
addresses though just invites spam.

This isn't greylisting, it's auto blacklisting by ip address.  Only
temporarily though.

I'm trying to use spam lists, but I either haven't got them configured
right or they are not catching anything.  This 66.10.9x.yyy domain is
literally trying with a different name each day to hook to me.

My service has been out a few days.  It will be out again briefly when
an upgrade to 768k service occurs.  It would have been nice if the
phone company had announced the upgrade, but it's undermanned and I
guess it really doesn't have to.

  I bought a HP Laser Jet 2100tn specifically because it came standard with
JetDirect and advanced Postscript support.  I was living in a household with
multiple flavors of M$, Macintosh, Unix being used.  It's great stuff.  It
has worked flawlessly with every computer and OS so far.

Can someone give me a quick refresher/summary of how these things work
from a networking point of view?

  The JetDirect card is an ethernet device.  My particular card also
supports a parallel interface, USB, Novell, and Apple EtherTalk.
Configuration is done through the front panel or telnet to the JetDirect
card IP address.

  The client side print driver or application writes to port 9100 of the
JetDirect card.  HP provides downloadable print drivers for most OS's from
their support site.  The interface for port 9100 is published and generally
supported.  CUPS and lpd work just fine.  The Windows printer wizard even
has a "Use JetDirect" option.

Er, uh, what is a parallel cable??  :-)

All my printers are on ethernet.  I have two HP LJ4M printers connected
by 10BT ethernet through JetDirect cards, and though they are still slow,
they are much faster than parallel would be ( when my wife wants to print
out a zillion web pages with photos on them, she uses *her* LJ4M ).

It is annoying to set up the internet addresses (poke-poke-poke 1,2,3,...
98,99,100 ), but once done it is done.  Then you put the printer in the
host tables, and ping it.  I use CUPS, and it the Redhat GUI for setup
is straightforward.  In general, adding another printer takes less than
5 minutes.

Note, with some printers you have to set the queue type to PS or LPD or
something else.  The HP4 doesn't care.

Stopping a printout is a pain in the ass.  Cancel the job with lprm,
then reset the printer, then wait while it spews the half-dozen or so
pages it has queued in memory.  Perhaps it does that in parallel as well.

I'm fairly happy with the Jetdirect connection, it is one of the rare
not-headaches in SOHO computer wrangling.

Pricewise, I see these for $10-$20 on ebay.  Make sure you get the right
version, of course.

Steve,

  That's good to know. My LJ 5 is 7 years old and in the hardware hospital
now to clear an errant error message and get a tune up and oil change. I've
added a duplexer, additional RAM and a PostScript module to it over the
years and it -- like most HP printers and the Okidata dot-matrix printers --
just works and works and works.

Rich,

I got a Print Server from CyberGuys (http://cyberguys.com/) that does 
three parallel ports.  The down side is it is _very_ Windows setup 
oriented.  I kind of made my life tougher when I bought it then didn't get 
around to installing for several months.  I did cave and installed/set it 
up from my wife's Win2K system instead of messing around with the 
manufacturer's support.  But once I got it set up it was pretty easy to 
get my Linux desktop to talk to it using CUPS.

The upside to the print server verses a manufacturer specific card is I 
can hook up any make/model printer that has parallel port.


Cost is(/was) $130(/120) +SH.

  In other words, we'd tell CUPS that the location is at localhost:9100
rather than lp0 or lp1, correct?

  Looks very easy.

  Yup, it does. And with 12M of RAM there's a lot in memory, too.

Rod,

  OK, now I think I understand. The print server is a separate little box
that takes the place of the workstation/server as the point of connection
for the printers.

  I'm looking to replace the parallel cables from the hardware with a couple
of cat5 cables from the switch. If that's not do-able at a reasonable cost
then I'll just move the second parallel port card from the existing box to
the new one when I make the Big Migration.

Thanks,

Rich

I recall some kind of no-touchie-just-workie Apple device that worked

I have a network card in my Epson Color Stylus.  It isn't JetDirect.

It has a REALLY weird and insecure feature, though.

See, you set the IP address by adding it to your arp table and pinging it.

How strange is that?

Not correct.  localhost is your computer.  You'll tell CUPS the location is
<PRINTER_IP_ADDRESS>:9100  Where PRINTER_IP_ADDRESS is set through the front
panel of the printer (pretty easy to do also) or let it grab one from DHCP.

Jet directs come on / reset to the ip address of 192.0.0.192, there is
usually a telnet interface for the older ones and a web based interface for
the newer ones. Fairly idiot proof. Just read the menus.

  I realized my error after I sent the message. I suppose that I get the IP
address _after_ the card is inserted. That'll work on the LJ 5 with its LED
display but I wonder what I do about the 2500C. Well, when the vendor
responds I'll ask them.

Thanks, Michael!

You know, that sounds very familiar.  It was servicing a batch of
Apple boxes, but it might have been a non-Apple printer.  And it was
some funky ARP thing, as I recall.

Rich,
I'm using a jet card in my HP1600cn and it works fine.
However,
The cost of the cards is high. For the cost of one card, you can buy a
multi parallel port print server and run several printers off one
print server.
I paid just under $100 for my last jet card and under $75 for my
Linksys Print server. it's a 2 port/switched print server. It has 2
parallel ports and 4 ethernet ports.
IIRC I paid something like $55 for the print server and was given a
DSL router to go with it.

Rich,
I'm using a jet card in my HP1600cn and it works fine.
However,
The cost of the cards is high. For the cost of one card, you can buy a
multi parallel port print server and run several printers off one
print server.
I paid just under $100 for my last jet card and under $75 for my
Linksys Print server. it's a 2 port/switched print server. It has 2
parallel ports and 4 ethernet ports.
IIRC I paid something like $55 for the print server and was given a
DSL router to go with it.

I think epoll was added in 2.6.x.

Here's a paper from OLS comparing epoll, select, and poll.  I haven't
read it, so I don't know how useful it will be.

Harry,

  I appreciate this. That's why I wrote to a vendor and asked for
appropriate models. They sell refurbished units, too, for a lot less than a
new one.

  One advantage of the cards to a separate print server -- from my
perspective -- is that they don't need a power supply with wall-wart and
cord.

I have had problems with the LinkSys.  I have not gotten it to talk to the 
second printer consistantly.  The documentation is not to clear what to 
call the second queue via lpd.  Maybe I need to use some other protocol.  
(Or remember to save my settings when I rebuild the system after six 
months...)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0408051731020.5797-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I've run into a strange one and have run out of ideas (until 3 minutes 
after I send this).  I installed the Tabbrowser extension and was loving 
it until I had problems with a couple of sites I use regularly.  So I went 
a looking for some way to un-install a Mozilla extension.  Found one but I 
think I got overly zealous and killed something I needed ... changing my 
preferences.  :-(
   My last excursion to bugzilla took far too long to ask a simple
question so hopefully someone here will know.  How do I get Mozilla back
to normal?  I did try an upgrade to 1.7.1 but no joy.  My shame is this is
on a Window system (therefore the WOS -- Wrong Operating System) so I
can't use my "*nix tricks" to scream through the files and look inside
them.

Any ideas or pointers?


TIA,

Nonsense.  I have a home network consisting of several Linux boxes
(Mandrake), an OpenBSD firewall, a Win95 machine and a WinXP laptop.
I have the Linux boxes and the Windows machines connected via Samba
and it works well.

There are, I understand, some problems with using WinXP Pro with
Windows domains and Linux, but I have never tried that, so cannot
comment.

I have a Win/XP Pro laptop networked with my Suse 9.0 Personal system. 
No problem seeing the laptop and sharing files via Samba. I have at 
times, exported my linux home directory, then mapped it from the Windoze 
side. What I haven't been able to do, is print to the shared windoze 
printer from linux. LinNeighborhood sees the printer, just haven't been 
able to get CUPS to talk to it properly.

Message-ID: <1091762697.1091.14.camel@fastlinux.homenet>

Hi All,

Do any of you know of a Live-Linux-CD image that has a kernel capable of
doing MPPE over a PPTP VPN?  I found one called KANOTIX, but I've
downloaded it three times, from three different servers and each time it
has been corrupted, very frustrating because the best download rate I've
been able to get is just barely above dial-up.  The Knoppix kernel
appears to be compiled with PPTP support, but not with MPPE encryption.

My ultimate goal is to run rdesktop from the Live-CD through a PPTP
tunnel.

Thanks,

Derek Loree

I'm too lazy to read what everyone posted, but for

supporting both the jetdirect cards and the hp
corporate laser printers and plotters.  I think that
they are fantastic, and if you need any help with

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0408060646370.30636@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Well, well, well. The upgrade from Slackware-9.1 to -10.0 is proving to be
much different than the upgrade from -8.1 to -9.0 was. I _thought_ I
followed each and every step in UPGRADE.TXT, but now neither networking nor
X works.

  Networking: I notice that interface information that used to be in
/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 is now in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf. So, I put in the host
IP address, netmask and default gateway. Run '/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 eth0 start'
and check ifconfig. Only loopback is up. What have I missed here?

  X: I missed the noise about changing from XFree86 to XOrg. Apparently
_very_ big changes. I no longer have an xinit file so Xfce-4.0.5 won't fire
up. I've asked for pointers from the xfce mail list but if anyone here has
good advice, please let me know.

  There may be more later, but I need to fix these two before I can move on.

Thanks,

Rich

  Progress. I read the X.org main Web page and understand what and why. Then
I discovered -- thanks to a fellow in Germany -- that the x11-6.7.0 package
was only partially installed. Re-installing the package put xinit and a few
dozen other missing files in /usr/X11R6/bin/.

  Now I have incorrect font directories in xorg.conf, but that's fixable.

Well, first off, the next time you want to uninstall an extension, you
might want to bring up Tools -> Extensions, select the extension you no
longer want, and hit the uninstall button.  That's always worked well
for me (on a linux box at least).

As for getting back your old configuration - if you regularly backup your
system you can try digging out the old configuration file.  It might be
something like c:/Program Files/Mozilla/prefs/user.js.

As a last resort, you can type about:config in the URL widget and try to
restore the configuration by hand.  Most of the time it's pretty clear 
what each entry does.  And I think that I once found a document on
mozilla.org that explains exactly what each one means.

It's possible that the extension added some entries to the configuration
(as extensions.tabbrowser.etc).  You might want to delete those if you find
them.

I've been trying to do this for weeks without success.  XP sees but

Sounds like a permissions problem.  The easiest way I have found is to
login to the winblows box with a username and password of a Linux user,
that should give you read-write access to the Linux users home directory
without any extra prompting for username and password.  Winblows can get
confused if you have logged in as a linux user with a password that is
different on the server (or, more commonly, no password at all on the
winblows box).  Also, double check your Samba settings and file system
permissions, make sure that the shares are browsable by the winblows
user.

Good Luck,

I'm doing something similar to that...

Any IP that "abuses" my mail system gets blacklisted for the following
two hours, then released.  The blacklist denies a connection
to my port 25.  ("You had me at HELO" :)

Abuse includes any of:

        not having a valid reverse DNS for the IP
        not having a valid sending domain
        sending email to a known spamtrap
        sending something that SpamAssassin says is above 8 points
        sending a known virus response mail

It's been working quite well.  I have a single Perl process monitoring
half a dozen log files, looking for the IP addresses, and invoking
pfctl commands to add them to a blocklist.  I also use dynamic dns
updates to publish an RBL, but this was mostly for my education, and
would not be a useful overall list.

At the moment, there are 1593 addresses on the list, and that
changes minute by minute.  Keep in mind that these are all
just the abusers in the past two *hours*, because after that,
they come off the list.

This doesn't eliminate legitmate email from these addresses, because
real mailers will retry again after two hours.

For grins from time to time, I look at my pflog0 interface with
tcpdump to watch the blocked attempts to reconnect, in particular
looking at the operating system (since I have passive fingerprinting).
95% of them are infected windows boxes on cable modems and other home
broadband.  Darn all this Redmond Virus Loader Malware!  Just now when
I checked, I got 193 attempted connects from blocked addresses in one
minute, so that's 193 pieces of email per minute that I'm successfully
blocking (and maybe one or two false positives in there that will
retry later).

  Fixed this, too. Left off a digit in the IP address in rc.inet1.conf.
Missing digits cause all sorts of problems.

It's been awhile since I set it up, but IIRC, these directories were 
helpful:

/usr/share/doc/howto/en/html/
/usr/share/doc/packages/samba
/usr/share/samba/swat/help/

If your running a different distro than SuSE 9.0, there may be similar 
information. Try as root in /:
# find ./ -name samba* -print

That will find every file that starts with the string "samba" on your 
system. Then, there are Samba specific newsgroups, and such. That's 
where Google becomes a good friend.

I recommened upgrading to the "unstable" release, which is at 0.9.xx
last I checked. It's not the least bit unstable, and the feature set is
greatly improved. I'm not even sure if there's any development happening
on the old 0.1 branch.

Getting to know Fluxbox is an idiosyncratic process. Documentation
doesn't seem to be a high priority. There are many window-dressing
features that are either improperly documented, or not documented at
all. At least that was the case the last time I bothered to tweak my
config.

Did you like it or not?  What was your impression of it?

It is handy if the program you want to watch is actually available on the 
on-demand portion.  It adds some programming to when "there is nothing 
on". I have seen some programs with glitches in the content from when it 
is encoded.  Seems to depend on who generated it.  There seems to be less 
on ondemand now than when it started.  (Probably because they are adding 
the pay-per-view to it and that is eating server space.)  Currently there 
are a couple of shows that i watch that are carried by it. ("Dead Like Me" 
and "Bullshit".)  It would be nice if there was more content from stations 
i cared about.

Thanks to everyone online and off who helped with the fluxbox issue.  Transparent menus and
borderless terminal windows are all the toys I really, really needed to be productive at work. 
Until the next time I get bored :)

For the curious, you can probably do the same by upgrading to the devel version of fluxbox.  The
transparent, borderless terminal can be had by using aterm and adding the following line to your
.fluxbox/menu:

  [exec] (aterm) {bblaunch -d 0 aterm -g 90x40 -vb -tr -sh 20 -rv -sl 1024 +sb}

Hi,

Would that be IPv4 and IPv6 at the OSI network layer and hardware at the 
OSI physical layer?

  Just to close off this thread: I give up trying to install it. I made soft

/usr/local/lib. Doesn't matter, the installer barfs that it cannot locate
the library.

  Can't find any address on the mozilla Web site to which a report can be
sent, so I'll stay with mozilla on that box and see what happens to firefox
in the future.

  So far my firefox experience is that 0.8.0 installed flawlessly on the RH
7.3 box but 0.9.1 and 0.9.2 won't install on two different machines, one
running Slackware-9.1, the other running Slackware-10.0,

  Oh, well.

Heh, people pay attention to the OSI Seven Layer Burrito still?  No,
IPv4 devices aren't aware of IPv6 unless they have an implementation of
IPv6 as well.

Subject: [PLUG] Burned images on CD/DVD end up zero-padded
Message-ID: <26043-07058@sneakemail.com>

On my Linux system when burning CDs or DVDs with the Disk-at-Once option
(aka SAO) the burned image ends up zero-padded to the nearest 2048-byte
block.  This isn't a problem for most applications, but when burning a
tar/gz or dump image in raw form to the DVD this corrupts the last file on
the disk.  In multi-part backups this could be a file in the middle of the
backup as well.

I've come up with several workarounds, but none are ideal.
  + dd the files with a blocksize of 1 and only grab the number of
    bytes as were present in the original file (slow, requires
    noting the number of bytes to grab)
  + build UDF filesystem images and copy the files there before
    burning.  (additional copy of each 4GB of data required, UDF
    has problems with files >2GB, restore slower since each volume
    must be mounted before it can be used)
  + build EXT2 filesystem images and copy the files there (still
    requires the space and time to make the second copy of each
    4GB)

The main problem seems to be that there's no way to write an arbitrary
stream of bytes (file) as a "track" to a DVD since the writer only
supports DAO mode.

Hardware/Software info, not that it should matter:
  + Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3
  + cdrecord + dvd patch
    (http://people.mandrakesoft.com/~warly/files/cdrtools/index.html)
  + problem also present using growisofs 5.20
  + Plextor PX-708UF, USB-connected

Anyone have a way to write variable length data to a DVD with the EOF in
the right place?

Is the only difference between pay per view and on demand who picks the

Yes of course.  Thing that's curious though is 
that doing IPv6 over IPv4 apparently requires 
using more bandwidth to send out the longer 
addresses.  Isn't 32 million possibilities 
enough?  Why does the whole world need to 
be fit into one IP space anyways?

Should DNS servers be upgraded to report ipv4
addresses in ipv6 format, or do most of them
convert on the fly already?

I wonder if the physical nic hardware has to
have a big enough buffer to send out ipv6
packets.  I guess if the MAC addresses haven't
changed, maybe not.  I'd imagine that those
have been lengthened too though.  I imagine 
a 128 bit address space requires a very large
routing table.

How much in TCP/IP networking does the 
arp traffic cost?  How about IPV6's router
discovery protocol?  Is the speed of a nic
the gross speed or the net speed?

  I mentioned this once before but didn't see any responses. I have several
large documents (that is, greater than 150 pages) in pdf format. When I try
to print the entire doc in a single run from within acroread or xpdf I get
only 12-20 pages before the feed to the printer ends. CUPS' job control
shows the job is active and the parallel port is wedged open. But, the
printer reads "Ready" and nothing more comes out.

  For giggles, I converted one to .ps and tried printing from the command
line with 'lpr'. It stopped at page 22 just like the copy from within
acroread.

  Has anyone else encountered this? It's a bit of a bother to print a large
document in small chunks.

TIA,

Rich

I have not checked into pricing yet but I was told that it is something like

renting from Blockbuster.

Hello all,

So I have this new project I'd like to do and looking for some
experience with Linux audio recording tools.

I would like to setup a PC with Linux and software to record a live
concert for my friends.

I'm looking for some software like "Cakewalk" or "Stienberg Cubase". 
I'll have 4 inputs coming into the computer.

Also, any hardware recommendations for the input device that works
with Linux would be great as well.

I dont' know if any of you have done such a thing but if you could
point me towards some software I'd appreciate it.  If not I may just
do a bunch of DAT tapes and post mix later.  That just seems too old
and time consuming.

Thanks,

Josh

  Well, upgrading from acroread-5.0.8 to -5.0.9 _seems_ to have cured the
problem. I'm at 30 pages now and trudging right along.

  Wonder if it's support for some new feature in Acrobat.

  I tried printing pages 117-231 inclusive. Actually got from 117-226 in one
shot and did the final 4 as a separate job. Must be something in the latest
Acrobat that's used to create the files.

  Anywho, I recommend that you upgrade to acroread-5.0.9 if you use this
application at all.

  BTW, xpdf also kept stopping. I don't know if I have the latest version of
that, either.

IPv4 is 32 bit, so 4 billion potential addresses.  Except that all of 
those addresses won't be used at once; the usage is fairly sparse.  One 
advantage of a huge address space is that anyone can talk to anybody 
without having to worry about NAT.  Also, it makes the trouble of 
getting addresses from an ISP disappear.

There isn't much point in reporting IPv4 addresses as IPv6 format.  IPv6 
only hosts are pretty rare.

IPv6 headers are 4 bytes smaller than IPv4 headers.  There is overhead 
with encapsulating IPv6 packets across an IPv4 network.

The Ethernet MAC addresses are 48-bit and there are no plans to change 
them.  48-bit is big enough for a while.

One of the big advantage of IPv6 is that could potentially reduce the 
size of the Internet routing table.  Prefixes could be assigned based on 
routing instead of whatever blocks are available or were assigned 
historically.

access off site web pages.

The way to stop a host 
from connecting to non local 
web sites is, reject packets  
destined for ports 80 or 443 
at those sites.  

How to do that without preventing 
squid from going out though is a 
conundrum for me.  I could
uninstall web browsers and
the like, but these are useful 
tools to have handy.

Can squid set the wrong destination 
port for a web page request?  I'm 
not using the telnet protocol.  If 
squid uses port 21 instead of 80, I 
might be able to mangle it's packets 
at my gateway before masquerading 
them.  I need something so that I 
can differentiate between the 
proxy server fetching remote web 
pages verses a local browser on 
my filter box.

Another approach I can see is 
moving the proxy so that there 
aren't anymore remote 
destination port 80 or 443 
requests ( except periodically
for ClamAV.)

Pay-per-view (although I never used it) is a "you buy this, you watch
it all the way through right now" service.  On Demand lets you pause,
rewind, fast forward (although only at 2x - ick) your video, and
rewatch it for up to 24 hours after purchase.

Think "poor man's TiVo".

I think it will completely replace PPV, since it's really PPV but
with more interactivity.

Hi folks,

I'm in the process of acquiring a new home desktop which will have all the latest bells and whistles hardware-wise.  I've decided to completely convert over to a linux-based system with this new box.  I'd like to hear opinions on which release I should use (Mandrake, Debian, RH, etc.).

I'll be using the box mainly for word processing, web surfing, possibly web hosting (if I can get my act together), and maybe a little gaming (though I rarely have time for that anymore). I'll need to be able to be compatible with Micro$oft word and excel for work purposes (will I need to run an emulator like wine?).

I've run both debian and RH 7.0 on an old (1997) dell notebook before.  Debian was nice, but it wasn't ready for solid notebook use at that time. RH 7.0 was solid and worked well for that old, slow notebook.  

Thans in advance. I'll now go back to my usual PLUG lurking.

Jim,

  They are all good; each has strengths and weaknesses. Make a list of
what's important to you then compare the various distributions based on
specific attributes. That's what I did when I decided to switch from Red Hat
to Slackware. Others have different criteria and make different decisions.

  Should we also help you pick a car, house, wife or job offer? :-) Only you
know what's important to you. You'll need to make your own decision and
accept the results without the ability to blame others. Regardless, you
won't go wrong.

  Download and install OpenOffice.org-1.1.2. No emulator needed; whines are
accepted if not too frequent. I use it on a regular basis to read and
respond to documents sent to me by folks stuck with Microsoft. When I
produce copies MsOffice can read no one has complained it won't open. Same
with Excel and PowerPoint files.

  Pick the browser of your choice. I actually use 5 different ones -- at
different times and for different purposes. My main browser is mozilla, but
I've replaced it with firefox on the two hosts on which I could install the
latter. The other boxes run mozilla. Those copies are well locked down. No
cookies, java or other extraneous stuff permitted. When I must allow cookies
or java I use opera. I also use lynx and links when I don't want a gui
browser. Whichever one(s) you pick need to be well waxed to preserve them
from the surfing spray.

  Apache is the defacto universal standard for http servers. It is included
with every distribution.

  On my 1999-vintage Toshiba Portege I've run both Red Hat and Slackware.
For your declared uses, any distribution -- in a current release -- will
fully meet your expectations.

  Give as well as take. It's more fun that way.

I've been using a little Hawking Technology  print server box to share 
my HP1300 on a network. It's a tiny little box with a ethernet 
connection and comes in either a USB or Parallel version. I got a USB 
version by accident but my laserjet supports both USB and parallel so 
this wasn't really a problem.  I've had no issues with it under WinXP or 
Linux.  I just set it up as a remote LPD printer queue on the Linux 
workstations I have on my network.

There are experimental iptables modules for building firewall rules
based on uid/pid. Then you can allow the squid proxy cache user access
to remote sites, while denying all other requests.

I think this is the most level-headed and clear-thinking response I've
seen to a (probably unintentional) prelude to a distro-war. I echo
these sentiments heartily, and only offer the following as my own
perspective -- and my own perspective is largely radically different
from your[1] stated needs. But, perhaps, this will help you develop a
broad perspective of the "pantheon" of distributions.

My own personal progression of distro's has been Slackware 2.0 ->
RedHat 4.2 -> Mandrake ... something -> RedHat 6.2 -> Debian. (Note
from the versions that this wasn't willy-nilly hopping back and forth:
at each stage, I spent good and serious amounts of time trying to
really use the strengths of each distribution.) And I've been on
Debian for a very long time now.

It's not terribly relevant to your needs, but the reason I ended up
with Debian was that it just "did things right"[2]. As a systems
administrator, I found that all along and up to the last version of
RedHat I was using, that I was constantly digging up src.rpm's and
building my own copies of software with the changes I wanted and
needed -- turning on options, adding patches, removing patches, making
changes in configurations. I find that more often than not, Debian
makes the same decisions I would make -- which, along with apt, means
that I end up doing less myself.

I do use Debian on my laptop in a desktop environment. I'm far too
removed from being a "normal user" to be able to offer judgement on
whether it would be suitable.

[1] Not Rich, hilsy.

[2] Upon proofreading, this statement, if taken out of context, sounds
patently absurd. Blend it together with the next sentence somehow.  I

Guess I just need to be more cautious, but thanks.  

Why do ISP's allow unfiltered web access anyways?  I 
know there are freedom of speech concerns, but don't 
social and legal concerns trump tho free speech 
argument?  The hardest job is administrator from 
the standpoint of knowing which filtering methods 
are in use and a number of inappropriate site names. 
Considering how many gambling and sex ads I pulled 
out of my PSU student email account, I'm finding 
that browsing uncensored on the net is higher risk 
than I ever bargained for.  There's Dan's guardian, 
but fine tuning it is an art form.  It isn't in 
place everywhere either.  Yes there are those who 
say that freedom is everything, but that depends 
on what freedoms you care about and if someone
else is exploited or not by your actions.  It's
easy to become an audience for some very abusive
sites online even innocently.

This is not the job of the ISP. They provide access, that is all.
If an ISP treated you like you're in China, they wouldn't have very many 
subscribers :)

Well, who's to say that what the Chinese do is always bad?  
There's a lot of garbage coming out of the Orient, unless 
it's from Oriental looking people elsewhere.  Actually, 
there's junk produced by people of all ethnic backgrounds
all over the world it seems.  There are laws against it in 
some regions that should be enforced better.  An ISP that 
filters out illegal and indecent materials is not doing me 
a disservice at all.  Internet materials are hardly speech 
in the sense of a conversation, they are in a special 
subcategory of media.   

Why do people get in legal trouble for their web activities while 
their ISP isn't responsible for allowing them to go wherever they
please?  What kind of society says that the person with an Internet
account who abuses it goes to jail without his/her ISP sharing any 
of the legal responsibility?  Why do so many prisoners have Internet
access?  Is lack of ISP liability turning the Internet into a criminal
safe haven?  Why watch your subscribers if you're not liable?

For the same reason the US Postal Service, UPS, FedEx, Qwest and every
other common carrier isn't responsible for what people send through
their services.  Their role is to provide transport/access.

The kind that says that if a person uses a Ford automobile to commit a crime
no one at Ford Motor Company is liable for that action.  The that says
individuals are reponsible for their actions.

It may not be. However, this debate is better suited for plug-talk. This 
has nothing to do with Linux or any other Unix type OS.

That's just it... If they filter ANYTHING, then they are responsible to 
filter everything. If they then miss something, they can be sued for not 
properly filtering.

I was a principle in an ISP in Eugene before moving to Portland. Our 
lawyer specifically counseled us against filtering in any way for that 
specific reason.

Most businesses will take the path with the fewest legal landmines.

I believe you will find that the internet is considered speech (freedom

Pioneer Square passing petitions.

Just how much regulation do you want in your life? Do you really want to 
have others decide for you what you can and can't view? This is why the 
Vchip was a bad idea. You can decide not to look for yourself.

Not to mention the horrendous overhead in cost. If the ISP is going to 
be deciding what you can and can't view, they need to hire staff to surf 
and find those pages they will block. Then they need programmers to 
program the filters. All this costs. Those costs will be passed on to 
you, the consumer. I suppose there is a market for this type of service, 
but it's probably cost prohibitive. You'd probably have to pay close to 
$50 a month for dialup service, but that's just a guess.

A society that hold people responsible for their own actions, as it 
should be.

You are ultimately responsible for every mouse click. You hire the ISP 
to provide a connection, not to babysit your actions on the net. If you 
want a babysitter, then you will pay more for it. Most of us feel we can 
take of ourselves.

Just like I think bartenders shouldn't be held responsible for how much 
their customers drink. Again this is because I feel we are each 
responsible for our own actions. The guy at the bar took that first 
drink and knows he shouldn't drive after 1 or 2 or 3 or however many. 
The bartender doesn't know for sure how YOU react to what your drinking.

The key here is personal responsibility. Don't give it away so easily. 
You'll end up losing a freedom you don't want to lose.

I will not reply to this in this forum again. If you wish to continue 
this conversation, reply in plug-talk.

Not an option on DSL where my provider doesn't provide filtering because
it is only considering it.  AOL is not available.  Besides, AOL isn't
Linux friendly from what I understand, let alone PCC and PSU friendly.

Even if you try to ship Uranium-235 fuel rods?  How about the anthrax
scare, mail had to be decontaminated to protect the health of
postal workers.  If transport and delivery companies don't want to
be responsible for what they move, any problem is just being 
passed on and potentially enlarged.  

The kind that says that if a person uses a Ford automobile to commit a
crime
no one at Ford Motor Company is liable for that action.  The that says
individuals are reponsible for their actions.  

So Internet criminals according to your argument should be regulating
themselves.  Internet service providers shouldn't be watching what their
subscribers are doing?  Internet access is not a car, it's a service.
The rules for commodities do not apply to potentially the largest
scale service ever devised in human history.  The, "it's what they do
and I don't care," argument is dubious because the Internet is the
largest public meeting place ever invented.  People should regulate
themselves, but the Internet offers it's own unique challenges. 
The current societal trends appear geared toward laxer moral attitudes
and less individual restraint where the Internet is likely a driving
influence here.  

A close to home example of questionable meddling is this new Amish
series.  Hey Amish freak, we're going to pull you out of your culture 
with it's filters and follow you to California, camera in hand,
to watch you violate your upbringing.  That's the way the ads 
for this new reality series sounds anyways.  It's a shame.  
I really can't comment any further since I refuse to watch
the show.  It's a social sin for any network to air that to any
audience, a sin committed by the producers and viewers of the 
program jointly.  One would hope that different cultures meet
with a shared interested in upholding basic human rights.
These Amish are treated like lifeless performers conveniently 
willing to accept exploitation.  Where can the show go, already
it's hyped on the idea that these women are going to go wrong.

As if the exercise and getting out isn't good for you.  If there were an
option to say this is what I want at a reasonable price, that might be
worth it.  Seems the entertainment industry is sickly off base though
lately when it comes to the choices available.  Seems that script
writers aren't needed for reality shows.  Are we really to believe
that there's no money for media censors?

Digital equipment for personal use has improved so much that I see no
reason a competing entertainment industry can't be grown from the
grassroots  Linux can be used to keep equipment costs down.  If 
there really is free speech in this country, maybe it's time it 
got used to produce a respectable alternative to the sickening
reality shows that are so common and clearly getting worse.

Just turn off the TV, Michael.

It's OK.  There's almost nothing worthwhile there anyway and everything
that is worthwhile can be downloaded and viewed on your own terms.

There's plenty of morally uplifting entertainment out there.  Most of it,
admittedly, is in books because the production costs are lower.  I
recommend works by the Crimeth, Inc. collective.

I fail to see the point.  TiVo lets you accomplish the same thing with
any show you want, and you just buy the unit.  You don't even need
digital cable.  If you have analog cable or use a rooftop antenna, then
you don't need any other hardware, the TiVo will work wonderfully as
your TV tuner as well.  If not, well, you lose the ability to channel
surf, which isn't a big deal since you get on-screen TV listings.  You
can even give up on live TV altogether, tell TiVo all the shows you want
to watch, and just fast forward past all the ads (watch Enterprise
inside 45 minutes!).

We have an ONDEMAND remote someplace.  Not that it matters, since
ONDEMAND doesn't ever have anything good on, and our digital cable
converter is wrapped in tin foil to help the IR blasters change the
channel on the cable box on behalf of the tivo...

I want to use the voice capabilities.  I've evidently run into an
unresolved symbols problem.  I'm using source code from Intel and
am wondering if it should be installed in the kernel tree.

Mgetty-voice isn't detecting that there's a voice modem, I can
however dial out with it in minicom.  I've attached the test
results from linmodem.org's scanModem program.

It's an Advantek product with product identifier, AM-56KI-INTEL-S.

I am absolutely of the same opinion, especially for servers, and
anything you want to muck around with in depth. Another cool thing about
Debian is the beginning of debian-based distros which do not diverge
from Debian. Skolelinux is a good example of it: it's proof of the
utility of Debian as a meta-distribution, while making it easy to
install and generally making good default choices for you that Debian as
an entity is unwilling to make. There are rumors of a new Progeny too,
Progeny being a once-upon-a-time user-friendly version of Debian started
by the Murdocks.

That said, I've heard nothing but good things about the 9.1/9.2
Mandrake, primarily from an end-user, desktop-usage, less-command-line
perspective.

Good luck,

Jeff

I've heard of Zabbix and the screenshots on their webpage

BigBrother started out with a free version and they maintain a
not-for-commercial-use version, which I've found no different than the
prior version(s).

Nagios (http://www.nagios.org) also looks good.  Has anyone that's

At the risk of disrupting your great love for the Amish and their 
alleged success with social filtering, this is actually an **Amish** 
tradition.  At ~16, teens are sent out to experience the world *before* 
being asked to commit themselves to living with the community.

It's called rumspringa and this show (while dreadful sounding) is hardly 
the first effort to package the experience for TV:

http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2002/may/amish/
http://www.oprah.com/tows/pastshows/tows_2002/tows_past_20021121_c.jhtml

There's a world of difference between *rejecting* modernism and 
attempting to *insulate* yourself from it.  If you're looking to the 
Amish as a good example of moral isolation, think again.

FWIW,

Dylan

Its.. um, free (regular TV shows, not new movies).
Maybe that's beacuse I have the $5/month HDTV box? Not sure.. but I know 
I don't pay anything for ONDEMAND.

I do agree that it sucks, however :)

Others have answered why most ISPs don't filter on content (to prevent
losing Common Carrier status legally), but there exists at least one
ISP that claims to offer filtered access, perhaps in ways you deem fit:
<http://www.integrityonline.com/>. Never used them (and have no desire
to have someone else decide what content I can or cannot see) so I
have no idea of their service quality or linux-friendliness. You might
perhaps query them to see if they'll ever be rolling out DSL service.

[Note that Integrity Online should not be confused with Integra Telecom,
 a spinoff/morphing of the old OGI Telecomm, which used to provide phone
 services for OGI and the surrounding business park, IIRC.]

What I do wish is that more consumer ISPs (especially ones that already
forbid running servers in their Terms of Service) would take the
Easystreet approach, and filter inbound access to low-numbered ports
for their consumer class service.

I haven't used Zabbix, so I cannot really compare the two, but I'm
pretty happy with Nagios.  I also use Cricket to monitor SNMP data and
Smokeping to track latency.  I kinda wish I had a tool that was
integrated and did all of it, but such is life.

rather than the recommended 4K/inode .  After about 150 days of use, 
dirvish filled up all the inodes, leaving 80GB of space on the drive
unused.  This is because dirvish/rsync overlays unchanged files with
hard links, making a much richer set of small directories.

It is impossible to add inodes to an existing partition.  If I want 
to keep all those files, I must do a file-level copy to another drive
with enough inodes, using either rsync or "cp -a" or tar or pax.

The problem is that there are an *enormous* number of little files
on these disks (150 hard links to the same data in some cases), and
none of these copy methods works efficiently with that many files.
Rsync bombs after using up all the RAM and swap (it needs about 80
bytes per file link).  "cp -a" is running now; after two days, it has
moved about 40% of the data, because it is traversing every file tree
in a rather unintelligent manner.  

Is there a better way, or some non-standard disk copy utility out
there?  For future use, I am thinking about building a perl wrapper
around rsync that moves data in smaller chunks rather than a whole
partition-full at a time.  However, if someone has already done
something like this, why re-invent the wheel?

I found out recently that an internal pci card hardware 
modem with the Intel 536 chipset can't do voice under 
Linux.

Why, I'm not sure.  It is awfully frustrating considering 
it doesn't do voice that I bought it for this purpose.  
Such is life.  It'll do 56k data and type III faxes.

I'm thinking about giving it away since it doesn't do what 
I'm after.  Go figure that there is voice software for 
Windows.  The irony is that the ebay seller said it 
works great in Linux.  Being a hardware modem, I didn't 
figure on running into a problem.

Have you tried tar-to-tar?  This is what you have to do on systems
without GNU cp.  It goes something like this:

tar cf - | (cd /wherever; tar xf -)

That's cool, another option though is getting a scsi card
and stacking multiple 50 gig disks striping them together
in a raid 5 or raid 0.  Best to do this with multiple
scsi cards for maximum speed.  Five disks on five scsi
cards striped together should work pretty well.  Scsi
cards, if you don't go top of the line, aren't terribly 
expensive on E-Bay.

Hmm.  You can also use a filesystem like reiserfs which has indefinite
number of inodes.  If you df -i on a reiserfs you get, er, interesting
results.  I've been using reiserfs on my snapshots.  I have had some
lockups on big rsyncs to USB mounted storage lately (on 2.6.7, 8-pre1
and 8-pre2).  Posted to the oops to LKML, but not sure if its been
solved yet.

I think the crux of the problem is the hardlink preservation.  In
order to do that, it needs to create a hash table of all of the
dev_no/inode pairs it sees as they go by so that if it sees a dup it
can create a hardlink in the destination instead of a copy.

Keith> Is there a better way, [...]

I don't know if it is better or even faster, but you might try
repeating the snapshots in the order they were initially done:

  cd /new-guy
  rsync -v -a -H --delete --numeric-ids --link-dest=../<snapshot-root-i-1>/ /full-guy/<snapshot-root-i>/ /new-guy/<snapshot-root-i/

where your new disk is mounted on /new-guy and your full disk is
mounted on /full-guy.  Rinse and repeat for each of your original
(/full-guy) snapshots.  

If you didn't run out of memory the first time, you should be okay the
second time too.  You can make it a shell script with the appropriate
snapshot directory names, start it and go to sleep. (notice the i-1
and i indices in my example).

/var/run/thttpd.pid contains the process ID for thttpd.  So we cat
that file in a subshell and get the PID.  Then we kill it.

Notice the backticks. The shell runs the command and feeds the output
into the command line. thttpd keeps it's last running pid in that file
and the command is getting that value and using it to send a signal to
the process (USR1) using the kill command. The signal probably
triggers the process do something, such as reload config file or
restart logging.

Matt,

  Thanks. Where do I find the meaning of the USR1 option to kill? The man

  But, the apache Web site does. Apparently this is one of three signals
that can be sent to the parent httpd process. USR1 means graceful restart:

"The USR1 signal causes the parent process to advise the children to exit
after their current request (or to exit immediately if they're not serving
anything). The parent re-reads its configuration files and re-opens its log
files. As each child dies off the parent replaces it with a child from the
new generation of the configuration, which begins serving new requests
immediately."

  Sorta' like stem cell growth.

  The other two signals are TERM and HUP. The first halts the parent process
and the second restarts the parent process _now_.

  Just need to ask google the proper way to find the answer.

Thanks, all,

Rich

BTW-This behavior of USR1 should not be assumed to be standard. USR1
is officially designated as a "User-defined signal" ('user' in this
case being the author of a userspace program). Just because Apache
interprets it this way, does not guarantee that thttpd will do the
same. (Though it probably does, given the context in which it is
issued.)

Oh, and HUP officially means the terminal hung up (as in over a
landline). It is *often* interpreted to mean "restart", but not all
processes will honor it (nor will they always interpret it as
"_now_").

Chris,

  It does.

  I've now fixed /etc/rc.d/init.d/thttpd so that it works and assigns the
actual pid to /var/run/thttpd.pid. Whew! That's one thing out of the way.

  Now I need to learn how to translate apache-executable commands in a
config file to thttpd-executable commands.

Thanks,

Do you have an data to support this??

I think I'll try it. As I mentioned before, now that I
use a pocket print server my need for network services
is minimal, since access to the printer was mainly
what interested me.

I think the Win XP box may need some attention,
though. One is never prompted for a password, and
Win-to-Win networking does not require it.

Check out http://www.linux-usb.org/ and search for the
particular usb device you want to use there.  USB 
sandisks flash sticks work great, don't know about 
tv tuners though.  I hardly see a point, there isn't
that much on worth watching anymore.

If some of the batteries might work - and the potential value of
these few is greater than the disposal cost of the rest - you might
wish to contact Tom Higgins ( tom at personaltelco.net ) of the Personal
Telco Project.  Tom might be able to use the NiCd and lead acid
batteries to power portable wireless projects.  He should probably
stay away from the bombs////LiIon batteries, but he might take the
whole batch off your hands if there is a good chance the goodies are
worth the dross.

Message-ID: <20040809074829.GB28007@gate.kl-ic.com>


I wrote, asking about copying a big disk with enormous numbers of
hard links to another drive.  Some suggested tar, others suggested
rsync.  I have not run Russell's example yet, but I did pick a medium
sized directory with 119 hard links and copied them three different
ways.  The results are:

               real       system
rsync -a:      37m 30s     2m 40s    // Not Russell's approach
piped tar:     18m 10s        26s
cp -a:         17m 22s        25s

I will investigate Russell's approach and see if that gives a speed
boost.  However, I suspect that this will be pig slow unless the
process knows what kind of structure it is processing, hence the need
for a magic program of some sort.  For now, I guess I will just leave
the damned thing running for a few more days.

I've also used Nagios and have been very happy with it.  Its "stock"
monitors give more reliable information than those included with Openview,
and I've had a much easier time finding additional plugins for Nagios than
Openview.  (To the point that I wrote a simple script to run a Nagios
plugin and convert its output to Openview-style so that I can use Nagios
plugins within Openview. ;-)

Like most monitoring frameworks, there is some effort to integrate it with
more specialized monitors (e.g. SNMP) but additional plugins are pretty
straightforward to write.

There is a place in Tigard that takes hazardous materials for recycling,

I used Nagios back when it was known as NetSaint. It was relatively easy to install and setup. I was quite impressed with the features and intuitive user interface. It has probably gotten better in the two years since I have used it.

I asked them (and complained particularly about the oracle centricity)
about that a few years ago.  I got nowhere at the time.  I've got
their CD-ROM around here somewhere.  And looking at their database
schema I found it somewhat horrifying.  You might be able to seek the
source code under some kind of FOI request.  You might be
unsuccessful, but that is never a good excuse for not trying.

Wil's invocation is nicely portable; it'll work with a variety of tar 
implementations. If you're only working with GNU tar, you can take 
advantage of the nifty -C (--directory) option which allows you to 
skip the subshell if you're so inclined. Also, STDOUT is the default 
output file, so "-f -" is unnecessary (albeit self-documenting).

Subject: [PLUG] GRUB question
Message-ID: <20040809205526.13599.qmail@web50609.mail.yahoo.com>

Mandrake and Win XP are now installed on my system and
booted by System Commander, but my attempt to add SuSE
has been frustrating. SuSE installed GRUB in the MBR,
but this hosed System Commander. Before doing anything
about this, I verified that SuSE was working.

I then inserted the XP boot disk and restored the MBR.
System Commander rejuvenates itself automatically when
this was done. However, it would not add SuSE,
complaining that it was defective.

Two possibilities occurred to me, both using
grub-install:

1. Put GRUB in SuSE's root partition and hope that
System Commander likes that better.

grub-install /dev/hda9

2. Put it back into the boot sector

grub-install /dev/hda

In that case menu.lst needs to be modified to find the
other OS; and perhaps Windows won't boot. (System
Commander would no longer be the boot selector in that
case.)

I think #1 is probably the best alternative...right?

You may be runn ing into a grub problem here.  Unfortunatly I am not at a 
place with my references on the issue.

If you search on google for "XP Grub Fedora" you will probably find the 
fixes for the problem.

Sorry I cannot be of more help at the moment.

  Thanks, Colin. I forgot that httpd would be writing to log files.

Here's /var/log/httpd/error_log:

Where are the sql-ledger scripts kept?

Could you please paste the section of httpd.conf that you're using?

Kind of interesting that it said ExecCGI if off rather than File Not Found,
but that just may be in the sequence of handlers.

But you are telling it to use the admin.pl script in apache's root doc 
directory by going to http://localhost/admin.pl.

A better URL would be http://localhost/script-alias/path/to/admin.pl

Also, I believe newer versions of apache won't run cgi from a symlink. I 
could be wrong on that. You'll need to enable cgi and "script-alias" the 
directory that the actual file resides in.

Right, because it's not a script-alias directory. It won't execute 
executable files unless they are in cgi-bin/script-alias directories.

Russ,

  Hoo-ha! I was just about to ask how I download and install DBI and DBD-Pg,
and when I tried your suggestion (which is, come to think of it, how it
should be entered) I see:

Error!

DBI not installed!

  So, when I learn how to download the two modules from CPAN and install
them in my perl installation, all should work.

Thanks,

Rich

perl -MCPAN -e 'install DBD::Pg'

That should take care of the DBI dependency as well.

Get a bottle of wine before you start.  I've done this many times and each 
forget to write down my own instructions.

The short story is: read the README, then read the README, and finally
read the README.  I just did (so I wouldn't look too much the fool here)  
and though parts have been fixed/cleared-up it is still a bugger.  The
PostgreSQL team knows there are issues that need fixing up.  (Check if
there is a package for your distribution already)  The case I run into all
the time is getting DBD-Pg installed on a system where there is no
PostgreSQL installed.  They also assume you'll be installing PostgreSQL
from source so have the include and library files installed.
   It shouldn't be this damn difficult!

I have a new install coming up this week so I have to learn the new 
or relearn the old.  Maybe between the two of us we'll get it figured 
out.

I used SQL-Ledger several years ago and loved it.  The install was a
bugger but once in it was in it was sweet.  The tech support was great.  
At that time it was $100/year.  Several times I sent messages to the users
list and Dieter had a reply back to me before I saw my own posting.


Good luck,
Rod

This is pretty timely for me as I have spent MANY hours recently setting
up Nagios to monitor my environment (mostly MS/Compaq-HP/Cisco).  

The problem I am running into is that to really utilize Nagios, it seems
you have to know a LOT about SNMP and MIB's so that you can perform
checks using check_snmp.  

Am I missing the boat somehere?  I just haven't found a lot of examples
on the web for "stock" configs to monitor Cisco devices.  Nor have I
found out how to implement the Cisco MIBs into the Nagios environment.
I have installed nrpe_nt and that seems like it will do what I want it
to for my Win environment.

Is there anyone out here that has some good Cisco configs that is
willing to share?

Thanks in advance,

Cam

I've also used Nagios and have been very happy with it.  Its "stock"
monitors give more reliable information than those included with
Openview,
and I've had a much easier time finding additional plugins for Nagios
than
Openview.  (To the point that I wrote a simple script to run a Nagios
plugin and convert its output to Openview-style so that I can use Nagios
plugins within Openview. ;-)

Like most monitoring frameworks, there is some effort to integrate it
with
more specialized monitors (e.g. SNMP) but additional plugins are pretty
straightforward to write.

No, that's right.  Nagios really excells as UNIX host and service
monitor and basic network monitor.  Add-ons, as you've found, make it
useful in NT/Wk2 (and maybe Netware too).  Really detailed monitoring of
network devices like routers and switches is really not it's forte.

If you want to monitor network devices, you can either use SNMP as
you've done or write scripts that telnet to their management interfaces
and get data that way.  If you want to handle SNMP traps, I recommend
'snmptt' to handle the traps; there's even an example of hooking it into
Nagios's notification system.

Put your Cisco MIBs in /usr/share/snmp/mibs (or something like that) and
Do an snmpwalk over the 'enterprises' branch and use '-m ALL' to tell
snmpwalk to load all of the MIBs.

I don't really have any Ciscos any more (other than a couple lab boxes),
but I have used Cricket to track system temperature, memory and CPU
utilization, etc.--it would be pretty straightforward to use check_snmp
to monitor thresholds for these parameters.

  I use Cricket from SNMP, but I'm planning on playing with Nagios later
this year.

  The "Defaults" file from the Cricket tool genRtrConfig would be a good
starting place to find Cisco OID's.  The genRtrConfig tool seems to have
most of the basic OID's defined in it's source code or the "Defaults" file.

The Cisco site also has an interesting tool for mining OID's.

  I don't use the Cisco tool much.  I generally just find the OID's I want
from doing "snmpwalk" commands and reading the MIBs.  YMMV

Jeme,

Yeah, weird... I thought it would do that automagically. I guess I'm
thinking of the BUNDLE process.

First and foremost, make sure you have the postgresql development
libraries.  If your distribution has a postgresql-dev package, make sure
it's installed.

But yeah, you should be able to just put "DBI" isntead of "DBD::Pg" in
the previous command.

Of course, if you were running Debian, it would have just been
apt-get install libdbd-pg-perl

and it would have just worked.

Thanks to Will and Steve.  I guess the biggest question here after your
feedback, is am I really using the right tool?  I am basically trying to
build and leverage open source solutions around my core IT expenditures
(Windows/Cisco).  One of my major initiatives is system and network
monitoring that is easily maintained/configured/monitored from a single
location.  I thought that Nagios was the answer for this but may be am
wrong.  

Thanks in advance for the help!

Subject: [PLUG] booting troubles for a knoppix/HD install
Message-ID: <86u0vby3sb.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

It seems like it booted okay the first few times, but now I am having
trouble.  This is an off-site box that is usually a windows machine,
but I set it up to dual-boot recently so that we could use some linux
tools on it and now I want to use it as a node on my parallel
processing cluster.

It is a Knoppix 3.4 hdinstall (or whatever the command was, about a
month ago I installed Knoppix on the harddisk) that I subsequently
updated using apt with the default /etc/apt/sources.list.

It seems that /proc isn't getting mounted early in the boot and the
root partition ends up mounted read-only.  Strangely, "mount" shows
them rw, but I can't write until I explicitly "mount -o remount,rw /".
The missing /proc (and read-only / ?) causes all hell to break lose.
I can recover when I am on-site by mounting proc and the remount as
above, modprobing e100 and ifup'ing eth0.  Sad thing is, I am not
on-site very much, and I am going to have to rely on a windows monkey
to reboot for me as needed.  I'd really like it to come up cleanly.
Since / isn't writable, I am not seeing any helpful messages in the
log files.

I suspected an initrd problem (particularly since I haven't tended to
use them before and I might be doing something innocently
disasterous), but my grub menu.lst looks appropriate-ish:

  title   Linux (2.4.26)
  root    (hd0,2)
  kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.26 root=/dev/hda3 ramdisk_size=100000 init=/etc/init lang=us apm=power-off nomce quiet
  initrd  /boot/initrd.img-2.4.26
  savedefault

I am currently building a new custom kernel with appropriate drivers
compiled in (thus causing the initrd need to go away), but can anyone
tell me what the problem might be?  This is a new one on me.

Subject: [PLUG] surprising performance on my HNOW nodes
Message-ID: <861xifjsfb.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I've been doing some test runs on my heterogeneous network of
workstations and found some surprising things.  I've got 11 slave cpus
running as follows.  The percentage on the right is the fraction of
the job (10 million random walks) the associate CPU completed:
  
   (1x P4 2.53GHz)             14.89%
   (2x P3 1.0 GHz)             11.00% and 11.52%
   (1x P3 1.2 GHz)             16.18%
   (1x P3[Celeron] 1.0 GHz)    13.32%
   (1x P3 750 MHz)              9.98%
   (2x P3 500 MHz)              5.49% and 5.53%
   (1x P2 450 MHz)              5.01%
   (2x P2 300 MHz)              3.51% and 3.57%

The most surprising thing is how sucky the P4 performed.  The 1.2 GHz
P3 did better, and it was even farther away on the network (about 40
ms latency over a 256kbps link, as opposed to 0.1 ms latency on a 100
Mbit ethernet).  Neither box had any significant load on them.

This is an almost exclusively CPU bound workload.  Hardly any memory
consumption (RES ~ 1370K), no disk I/O and very little network I/O.
Mostly floating point operations.  The same binary is running on all
nodes, all working on the identical problem.

The other slightly surprising thing is that the 1GHz Celeron did
better (per CPU) that the P3 1GHz, but the latter is my workstation
where all this crap is scrolling away, so it is possible to
rationalize that one.

Any clues about the P4 stinkiness?

It doesn't look like this is possible, so I settled on splitting the
backups into files that fit 3 per DVD, avoiding the 2GB ISO file size
limit.  I avoid the Linux-UDF problems by using a straight ISO9660
filesystem.

Unfortunately this does mean that I'll be doing the mount shuffle during a
restore rather than just simple media swaps.

Another option is to skip compression, since that seems to result in an
image that breaks consistently on 2048-byte boundaries if I choose an even
number in the -B option for dump.  However, I can see this failing
silently should something odd happen, and it also uses significantly more
media.  It does offer the benefit that damaged media will be simpler to
recover since the whole compressed data stream won't be hosed by one bad
sector.

Avast!  I declare, with fair impunity, that Linux SUCKS at audio
processing, despite that Linux Journal article and all the others trying
to present the illusion that Linux's audio tools are comparable to
Windows.  They're not.  None of them has the feature set of Logic Audio
or Cubase.  Most are seriously buggy.  And getting good hardware
support, minimizing latency issues?  Jacks?  Good luck!

I realize this is flamewar material here, but I strongly advise you, if
you've any desire to get your work done and not just monkey with the
software, to use Windows for audio processing.

By the way, I use Linux at work and for most things at home too.  Let me
enumerate the reasons I still require Windows, personally:

1. Audio recording/processing.
2. Games.
3. Setting up my Comcast modem (but that's just Comcast).

  I just received a message that purports to come from US Bank and directs
me to a Web site to verify information. Turns out that the originating IP
address belongs to:

Time Warner Telecom TWTC-NETBLK-4 (NET-66-192-0-0-1)
                                  66.192.0.0 - 66.195.255.255
Ace Computer Company Rochester TWTC-ACC-01 (NET-66-193-26-32-1)
                                  66.193.26.32 - 66.193.26.63

  This is obviously an attempt to steal identities. Is there a law
enforcement agency to whom this should be forwarded (in addition to Time
Warner Telcom's abuse team)?

TIA,

don't suppose you've ever had the need to snmp Orinoco equipment?  I've 
been trying to find OID's for signal strenth, noise, and SNR for OR-1000 
or AP-1000 devices.

You can forward it to CIA, so they can send marines over to TW to get

Ok, I give up. It's obvious that comcast's sucky webmail isn't good enough
for me. So I'm using Pine (for other reasons that don't really matter).
I've set up my (debian-testing) system with Pine, spamassassin, procmail,
and spamassassin is processing my mail.

However, someone a long long time ago posted how they used macros within
pine to tell spamassassin that one post was junk and the other not junk
(training the bayesian filter in sa).

If that person is still out there, or if there's someone else who has a
clue what I'm talking about, could they give me a few tips, please?

Thanks in advance.

  Nope... I don't use any Orinoco gear.  Lucent's color glossy says that the
AP-1000 is a SNMPV2 device.  The information you're looking for may *not* be
available via SNMP.  The SNMP MIBs always seem to be a couple of years
behind the operational software.  

>From the Proxima Support Site:

Question 
Which MIB's are supported by ORiNOCO Access Point and Outdoor Router? 
 
Answer 
The AP-Manager is delivered with MIB files. 
Below the three supported RFC MIB are listed with their SNMP root branch
values: 
RFC1213.MIB: MIB-IIn = 1.3.6.1.2.1 = mib 
RFC1398.MIB: Ethernet MIB = 1.3.6.1.2.1.10.7 = transmission.7 
RFC1493.MIB: Bridge MIB = 1.3.6.1.2.1.17 = mib.17  

  These are only the standard SNMPV2 MIBs.  They don't contain any wireless
information.  


Do the following command on the devices:
snmpwalk -v2c -c <community> <IP address> system 

You should be able to dump the System Table from the device if SNMP is setup
correctly.  

Then:
snmpwalk -v2c -c <community> <IP address> . | tee ./Orinoco_walk.txt

  This will dump every SNMP table from the device.  You should be able to
pick out the radio stats from the raw data, if they exist.  

  The snmpwalk command will normally output SNMP OID's in decimal format.
You can also follow Wil's instructions to install any proprietary AP-1000
MIB onto your system.  Then snmpwalk command will output the text name for
the OID's.

Russ,

  Not within pine; at the command prompt and as root:

With little network activity, it should be obvious why the P3 1.2GHz
didn't suffer from that latency. So left with what killed the P4? First
thing I'll note is despite the resident size being 1370KB notice that is
bigger than the cache of most processors. Notably if this is a late model
P3 then it might have 512KB cache, if the P4 was an early model it might
have a mere 256KB.

Is the heatsink properly in place on the P4? If it isn't the P4 might be
throttling its clock to keep cool.

Even if that isn't an issue, you've got your finger on the button right
there. The P4 architecture stinks. I /thought/ the P4's FPU was supposed
to be reasonable, but it could be a sucky FPU. More significantly the P4
architecture has high-latency all over the place. If your code has a lot
of irregular branches, this will *kill* the P4 (no modern processor likes
branches, but none compare to the P4's dislike of them). The P4 also has
very high memory latency, if the code size is large cache effects could
be huge.

Also, it's important to note that bayesian filters need just as much 
--ham as --spam.

I try to run --ham on my inbox once a week as well. Running sa-learn on 
mailing list folders seems pointless, though, since SA is really good at 
recgonizing mailman and majordomo droppings.

  True, true. I used a couple of old mail files -- more than 2,000 messages

Subject: [PLUG] LDAP help
Message-ID: <41194AE2.7010807@comcast.net>

I'm having some problems with getting my LDAP server going.  I'm running 
Fedora Core 2 and I've done all of the udpates.  The server seems to 
start and run just fine, but the problem comes when I attempt to convert 
users.  I've run ldappasswd to get an encrypted password which I then 
pasted into my slapd.conf file.  The problem comes when I attempt to 
convert users.  I'm issuing the following command:

ldapadd -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=k12,dc=or,dc=us" -W -f nclack.ldif

When it asks me for the password I get the following error message:

ldap_bind: Invalid credentials (49)

Can anybody tell me what is going on and how to resolve this issue?

Also I need an easy to use tool for admin users to be able to edit LDAP 
users.  What do you recommend for this?  It can be command line or web 
based.

Thank You

The P4 has 512 KB.  The P3 has only 256 KB!

This might be it.  The main loop traverses a list of heterogeneous
objects.  Certainly there is branching to handle different subtypes,
and branching to decide whether computations are even needed in some
cases.  I'll have to go back and look that code and see if I might be
able to smooth it out.

Do you know which modern processors might be better?  

Does anyone want to volunteer their CPUs to be part of my HNOW?

Thanks!

Assuming you typed the ldapadd invocation correctly above, you're 
using the wrong binddn (-D), because in your config file the root 
account has a different dn:

   rootdn          "uid=Manager,cn=users,dc=k12,dc=or,dc=us"

Try instead

   ldapadd -D "uid=Manager,cn=users,dc=k12,dc=or,dc=us" [...]

The rootpw directive is in plaintext. This is for: a) convenience
during a recovery scenario, b) to encourage you to not keep your
password in slapd.conf.

Actually, now that you point this out, this is a horrible tree. cn=
shouldn't appear along the middle of the path, and you should have
some additional dc= or ou= components, unless you really ARE building
an LDAP tree for ALL of K12 in Oregon... :-)

Well I am doing that right now.  I assume you mean:
/home/zot/.vnc/xstartup

Mine reads

        # Red Hat Linux VNC session startup script
        unset SESSION_MANAGER
        vncconfig -iconic &
        exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

I had a bunch of issue with gnome not starting.  It appears that 1 old
gnome process was running.  Took a while to hunt it down.

It might have been esd.

You can test by replacing gnome-session with twm.

Be sure not to confuse the basedn and the rootdn. A "cn=" is perfectly
fine in the rootdn.

Yes indeed, the "industry practice" these days is to use the full
domain name:

	domain name: nclack.k12.or.us
	basedn:      dc=nclack,dc=k12,dc=or,dc=us

You've double-checked? Okay, so we're not seeing a cache effect here.

Removing branches will help any modern processor (just most won't die on
branches like the P4). Are you running an SMP kernel? Try running your
program as two processes. They'll fight for the core, but may result in
fewer pipeline stalls, helping the P4.

> Do you know which modern processors might be better?  

Anything that isn't a P4.  :-)   Seriously, Intel Marketing told Intel
Engineering "clock speed at all costs"; what they got was a processor
that could handle high clock speeds, but had a 20 stage pipeline. They've
now revised it to a 31 stage pipeline seeking yet higher clock speeds.
The result is what you'd expect, in nice consistant loops you get good
performance, in code with hard to predict branches you get killed.

The Intel Centrino wasn't about clock speed and doesn't have this
problem. The AMD chips go for clock speed, but not at the cost of
performance, they'll be fine. PowerPC chips are known for a short
pipeline, if the branches really are the problem they can't be beaten.

You have to set a password on the dataset.

Also, don't forget to run the setup/install script.  It should walk you

I spelled it out at the beginning of the thread:

  HNOW = heterogeneous network of workstations

... and all I want is a few trillion cycles. ;-)

Basically, you'd run a slave process on your box (niced to taste)
which connects to my master program.  The latter hands out a job and
the former computes random walks.  I haven't worked out how to manage
it yet.  I either need a ssh login on the box, or I could provide you
the slave program and we could set up some kind of watchdog to restart
it if the master dies.  I am still debugging a few bits and the master
might have to restart occasionally, necessitating reconnection.

It might be good for an acknowledgement in a journal article. ;-)

Hmm.  It is an SMP kernel (on a uniprocessor box).  Running two
processes didn't do any better in aggregate.

Sorry, I was being just a little dense.  Does it have to be a

It shouldn't matter to me.  I've currently got everything from P2

Cool!  Thanks.

I've got more testing and debugging to do.  I'll probably be ready to

  I want to upgrade my notebook from 9.1 to 10.0, but I don't want to
upgrade the kernel. I believe that everything is left in /boot so when the
automated 'upgradepkg */*' is finished I just need to ensure that the links
(e.g., vmlinuz) point to the old kernel rather than to the new one. Correct?

My copy of Spamassassin suddenly went nuts. It's suddenly started
thrashing on the disk for a long time, causing timeouts in sendmail.
I killed it manually after a minute or so myself a few times. I
finally got it to stop by removing the bayes* files in ~/.spamassassin.

It's a fairly recent install, but I don't know how to tell the version.
I don't see anything obvious in the files.

I have it set to autolearn, and the message count was only at 1535.

Is this "normal"? I hate to think I'm going to have to babysit
Spamassassin to make sure mail delivery keeps working.

I've seen it thrash when there was a significant backlog of mail to
process.

SpamAssassin versions prior to 2.64 are vulnerable to a denial of 
service attack. See, e.g.,

   http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200408-06.xml

This, of course, may not be the problem you encountered, but it's 
worth mentioning just in case.

I've had this problem in the past when my Bayes caches get too large (20
MB, though I'm not sure it's strictly a cache size issue). SA would
churn for many minutes on one message, and even longer if I was asking
it to rebuild its database. Deleting the existing cache files and
rebuilding from a directory full of saved spam does the trick. I realize
that's not a very satisfying solution, but I didn't have the time to dig
deeper.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0408111631250.13509-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I'm still new to postfix so don't know for sure if I can block (or sink) a
couple of C-Class IP ranges using Postfix and besides iptables seems the 
better way.

There is, if you've never ran into them, a bunch of domains that trick 
users into giving their friends and families e-mail addresses to them in 
exchange for movie tickets.  Since they keep changing their domainname 
with slight variations we find out their IP range(s) and block.
   So I've set up a SMTP inbound gateway to take the load off the main 
mail server(s) and want to block them there instead of having the 
mailserver software handle it.

Iptables confuses me to no end and all my reading has just made it worst.
(Suppose I have a mental block from an early bad experience? :-)  Anyway;
anyone have a quick and dirty iptables filter to block a C-Class they'd be
willing to share?


TIA,
Rod

On the host in question, something like

iptables -I INPUT 1 -s x.x.x.x/24 -j DROP

should do the trick reasonably well.

I'm sure slightly more elaborate (or less harsh) versions could be
written and will be suggested as well.

Josh,

  It's smart enough to converse with the addressbook in the PDA and to pick
its owner and friends carefully. Mine doesn't lecture me; we have beneficial
dialogs on meaningful topics.

Message-ID: <20040812034048.19687.qmail@web50605.mail.yahoo.com>

Things are unilateral, pretty much. My computer has
SuSE installed, and I can get Samba access to files on
my wife's computer, running XP. But she couldn't log
in, even if motivated to do so.

I'm pretty sure it's an authentication problem. Say I
have a single user named "George" with a password of
"login." I enter this information into smbpasswd -a
George. But she is "Chris," so for now the
user/password combinations cannot be made to
correspond. XP prompts for a user and password, but
nothing will work.

What csn I do to solve this? It would be desirable for
both parties to retain access to their files after the
solution is implemented.

Is there someplace else that would be better?  Time is much more

I'll recommend SciLab having used it a little.
It's aimed at Matlab users, which is popular in university engineering
and physics courses. There are also Matlab to SciLab conversion utilities.
SciLab is maintained actively, has good documentation and has few bugs.

Octave tries to be compatible with Matlab as much as possible - an advantage
to some.

You could get an Academic version of Matlab and try it out.
The real Matlab is expensive, but highly capable and multi-platform.
It is sold on eBay too.

  Thank you very much, Douglas. I'll researh them all. This past weekend I
learned from the folks on the octave-help mail list (most of whom do very
sophisticated math) how to calculate the principal engenvalue and associated
eigenvector in a 4-line octave program. It does require intimate familiarity
with the language to understand how to structure the code to arrive at the
desired results.

Rich,

Mine doesn't lecture me, I'm tipically lecturing IT on battery life,

Mine just makes me nervous. I'm still trying to figure out why anyone
would trust an essentially black-box computing device with an always-on
network connection to some of their most personal information.  Methinks
it could (will?) backfire on folks some day in the not too distant
future.

Perhaps I'm just paranoid, though. Does anyone here have a better idea
of the internals of the average "smart" phone (by smart phone I mean any
of the Symbian-, MS-, etc- powered devices)?

Thanks Sandy. I was looking at the options for spamd. I forgot you
could run stand-alone. So I guess I'm running V2.55.

I don't get enough mail for there to be a backlog :-). Maybe 100-150
per day, including the spam I reject.

Good to know. Mandrake doesn't seem to have an update yet. But I doubt
that's the problem, since it was happening on every message.

That sounds like what's happened. My caches were nowhere near that size,
though, more like ~6MB. I was afraid rebuilding from the saved spam would
just re-introduce the problem, but maybe I'll try that. Could the problem
be auto-learn?

One thing I've always wondered,... when Spamassassin tags spam, it's adding
a new MIME part with summary data. Is it smart enough to ignore that when
learning spam? I've got about 10MB (~1800 messages) of spam like that,
and another 4MB (~600) messages that I've saved myself that Spamassassin
missed.

Subject: [PLUG] Failing Notebook Hard Drives and extreme paranoia
Message-ID: <20040812194646.GA26357@gate.kl-ic.com>

ENU is indeed a good place to find laptop drives.  I have also seen
them in some of the Computer Renaissance stores, which are in many
cities in the western US.

It is probably too late to help Sean today, but I am ultraparanoid
about losing laptop availability when going on the road, especially
if I am giving a paper with it.  So, some tricks:


Besides the nightly Dirvish equivalent-to-full-image backups that I
do, I also carry an Ultrabay hard drive holder for my IBM thinkpad,
with an identical spare 40GB hard drive in it.   Then, at night in
the motel room, I go into single user, kill noncritical processes,
and do a:

   sync ; dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdc bs=1049576

Which takes about 2 hours and makes an exact copy of the drive,
including all the ext3 partitions and swap partitions.   If I lose
the hard drive the next day, or do an "rm -rf /", I only lose the
day's work.

Partition your laptop drives with a few hundred empty MB at the end -
it is a pain in the tush to try to copy a 40.9G hard drive into a
different-brand 40.0G hard drive, if you've used all the space. 
Fortunately, data blocks are data blocks, so you can migrate a
whole file system to a different drive, if it fits.  Put a second
swap partition at the end of the drive - those are easy to resize.

Of course, I also carry a CD and a USB stick with the critical data
and presentation on it.

Sean learned (as have I) that laptop hardware will ALWAYS fail the
day before an important trip.  Of course, that is when you are behind
schedule and making all those copies of things, so you are pounding
the keys less gently than usual.

So, the next (expensive) paranoid option is that my wife has the
same model of Thinkpad.  "Sweetums, can I borrow your laptop for a
few days?  Here's the instructions for putting your hard drive back
into 'your' laptop when it returns from IBM service, and here's the
jeweler's screwdrivers."  Thank goodness that IBM always manages to
repair and return laptops within 48 hours.  And the Airborne Express
folks have Thinkpad shipping boxes on hand, just call for an RMA and
a box.   Airborne will deliver a box in the AM and return for a pickup
in the PM, usually.  Sweetums is not deprived of JPilot for long.

That is way more paranoia than most people can stand, but it works
for me.   The nightly backups to the spare hard drive are probably
the easiest (and spare 40G laptop hard drives are $100 these days).
Thank goodness this isn't windows - no "pretty please, may I, Bill?"
required to copy a drive.


As I said in my Dirvish/Rsync presentation, "shit happens".  And as
long as Satan walks the earth in a thong bikini, shit happens at the
most inconvenient time.  Plan ahead and have the tools ready for
recovery, because Satan visits after the computer stores close, and
she will distract you with more shit while you are trying to recover
from the previous disaster.  The bitch.  :-\

If you're willing to pay a little extra and don't want to do it
yourself, Commercial Electronics Service Center on SE Stark will do it
and doesn't flinch at Linux.

Actually I am fairly paranoid myself.  I usually back everything up to

night.... ARGGGG.....

  I installed wine-20040716 and a winduhs app I want to run. It worked -- at
first. However, when I ran 'winecfg' something broke and now wine won't
start. It complains that it cannot find c:\\windows, but that path is
defined in ~/.wine/config.

  Has anyone seen this before? I've read the wine and wine.conf man pages
plus the faq on the winehq Web site. I've posted on the wine-users help mail
list, but if anyone here has a clue I'd greatly appreciate your sharing it
with me.

I don't have an answer for you, Rich... mine's working and I'm a
noob....  which means I don't even know enough to be dangerous.

But, I do have a related question.  Sorry for hijacking your post like
this.

Has anyone seen or gotten windows scripting (WSF) to work under Wine?
Or is there an open-source interpreter for WSF out there?  The one
solution I found in an old defunkt-but-Google-cached web page
recommends that I install dcom95.exe; but, that fails miserably.

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix clarification...
Message-ID: <1092363718.18541.112.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

What's the difference between the terms client and sender in 
postfix 2.1.1's config file?  I created an ip list of sources
being 450ed that I wanted 550ed and discovered I had to do
check_client_access my_list.

I've noticed two unusual things.  
The helo address can be anything, even junk.  I've also run 
into clients that connect to me with a helo address that I 
can't look up, but the domain part will be valid.  Instead 
of blocking unknown and non fully qualified hostnames during 
helo checking, is there a way to truncate the test string on
failure and retest?  Strip the host off.

Another approach I've thought of is holding the first unknown 
message and black listing any more that try to come in using 
the same bogus helo until that hold is resolved.  
I'm looking for a better approach than simply delivering 
a questionable message.  I have ClamAV and Spamassassin, 
but these are never guranteed.  Antiviral software 
for Linux is far behind what you can get in a MS Windows 
environment.  I probably want a timeout on holds, 
destroy the messages if no directive otherwise is 
received in a week's time.

For a hold scheme the whole entire email message is on hold,
so I should be able to extract the header without getting
the body or any of the attachments.  Naturally it makes
sense to do antiviral scanning on any untrusted message
on hold, avoids having to get user input if the answer is
obvious.

Someone commented that they do temporary black listing
to throw off zombies, I could use some pointers on this.

Glen,

  A complete re-installation solved that problem. What I discovered, though,
is that the Slackware package installs into $PREFIX=/usr and doesn't do the
~/.wine directory while the source tarball installs into $PREFIX=/usr/local/
and does create the directory and subdirectories, including the config file.

  It's strange, however. My $PATH does, of course, include /usr/local/bin
but when I tried to start wine it whined about not finding any such file. As
soon as I made a soft link from /usr/local/bin/wine to /usr/bin/wine it
fired right up. Also had to make a soft link for winecfg.

  Now I want to learn why a program running in wine cannot call another
executable. That's the current sticking point.

  Go start your own thread, Glen. :-)

You probably just needed to run "hash -r".

Chris,

  Well, I just read the help for it. I'll need to read it again to digest in

The client is the host that connected to you.
The sender is the envelope sender, i.e. what's sent in the Mail From: 
command.

reject_unknown_hostname, I think is what you want.

Something like:
smtpd_helo_restrictions =
      permit_mynetworks,
      reject_unknown_hostname,
      reject_non_fqdn_hostname,
      permit

I'm already doing reject_unknown_hostname.  The
problem is, say you get mail from exch01.providence.org
and the only name you can look up is providence.org.
Assume exch01.providence.org is valid, but it will be 
blocked if there's a reject_unknown_hostname check
because there's no host record for exch01 in 
the providence.org Internet name servers.

Yes I can do check_sender_access override_for_providence,
but that's an awfully inflexible and error prone approach.

This problem appears to be very common with
Microsoft based mail servers on the Internet.
Seems the admins of those sites often fail to 
set up sub domains for their exchangers 
properly.  If you send to 
plug_0 at goose.robinson-west.com, 
you'll still get to me because 
I have fixed this problem with 
a subdomain set up in my dns.

Here's an example of my solution using fictitious names...

$ORIGIN robinson-west.com
boo			A	209.210.202.172
foo			A	209.210.202.170
boo			MX	10 mail.boo
$ORIGIN boo.robinson-west.com
mail			A	209.210.202.170

Providence obviously isn't doing this or else
exch01 would resolve and I wouldn't have to
bypass the smtp restrictions.

I got it for $13 thinking it's an intenal hardware modem that can
do voice.  Intel's Linux driver for this modem doesn't support 
voice, but there's Windows software that supposedly will.

I went to linmodems.org and asked about voice support.  Supposedly
there's code for this that is in the driver, but it has never
been tested.  I know next to nothing about low level serial
programming let alone Intel's controllerless hardware modem.
It's a winmodem with a DSP chip, yeah confusing.  I looked
on Ebay for a true hardware voice modem.  I was looking at 
a weird brand external with serial port connection for $50
or so by the time you ship it E-Bay auction.  
No idea if it works under Linux.  A name brand U.S. 
Robotics 56k external voice modem was selling for 
nearly $100 on E-Bay.  Over priced comes
to mind.  I just sold a 33.6 external U.S. Robotics
for $10, no shipping.

The guys at linmodems.org want to know if I'm going to try
to get my pci modem with the Intel 536ep chipset doing voice
under Linux.  I have no idea how to accomplish that.

If you have an HCF type winmodem with voice support, a linuxant
driver will have you answering your phone in no time.  I have
an HSF winmodem with voice, no good.

Mostly samba-client stuff.  I'm stuck dealing with several Win2K servers 
that have data I process using several Perl scripts.  Trying to do it on 
the Windows servers made their already pathetic performance worst.
   I now mount the SMB/CIF share on a Linux box and run the scripts from
there and all I eat is network performance.  Since the servers are on a
Gig internal/private network and scheduled for non-peak usage times they
motor right along.

At home for awhile I couldn't burn CDs on my Linux desktop so I shared a 
folder on my wife's Win2K system, downloaded the images and friends to the 
share and used some Windows software to burn CDs.

The drivers don't work with 2.6, last time I used mine (2 months ago).

Sometimes you just have to use windows.

I turned that on about a month ago, and dropped my inbound
spam load about 80%.

However, I'm finding that there are some VeryLargeCorporations with
apparently pinheaded people running the border gateways that do not
even set up correct rDNS for their gateway!

Stoopid People.

So, now I have a whitelist:

smtpd_client_restrictions =
	permit_mynetworks,
	check_client_access pcre:/etc/postfix/client_access_pcre,
	reject_unknown_client

where client_access_pcre looks like:

    # this table permits/rejects inbound mail connections based on IP addresses
    # or domain names.  I'm using it to whitelist some misconfigured hosts
    # oreilly.com:
    /^209\.58\.173\.10$/ OK
    # globix.com:
    /^209\.10\.69\.160$/ OK

Oh, oops.  Did I just put some real names in there?  Oops. :)

In the process of installing Fedora on one hard drive of my computer,
something went wrong with the Windows XP installation on a second
drive.

XP now hangs while it's booting.  When I boot XP in safe mode, it lists
about 30 files and stops after \Windows\System32\Drivers\Mup.sys (no, I
don't expect this to be meaingful to anybody, but I'm desperate).

If I boot from my Norton Anti-Virus CD, it scans the hard disk (and all
it's files) without finding any problems.

The drive also looks OK if I boot Knoppix.

My Windows recovery disk wants to wipe everything out (which I'll
consider as a last resort).

Does anybody have suggestions for fixing the problem?  (no jokes
pleeze)

Barring that, does anybody have any suggestions for getting the latest
files off the XP partition?  If I boot from a Knoppix CD, is there any
way to eject the CD and use the CD drive for backing up?  How?  

I don't have other PCs at home to network to, and I don't have a floppy
drive, but I do have a 128mb SanDisk USB thingy.

Can I run Windows on top of vmware to get the Windows 
voice package working?

Is anyone likely to figure out voice in the near
future for these?  What modems will work under Linux
for voice?  My options are pci, usb, and serial.
If I get a USB one, I cat get a USB2 card with an 
internal USB port and hide it inside the server 
case.

Has anyone done a dial-in server with an Intel 536ep 
chipset modem?

So, you say that it's a second (?) drive with an XP Partition - when
you boot to Knoppix, can you access another drive (or partition) you
could copy your important data to?

I have the same.. but not using pcre's. I probably should, it would 
decrease processing time, in theory.
Of course, I only have about 5 things in my whitelist.

I have read-only access.  Is it possible to change that under Knoppix?

Look at the man page for the mount command. You should be able to remount 
it as read/write.

I tried that last night, but it said I had to be root to do it.  Any
idea how to find the root password on a Knoppix CD?

Thanks Chris.  I finally found this information -- probably about 5
minutes after you sent this -- as I kept searching.

You'd think this would be an example at the top of the list for Netfilter
and iptables but every site, except one, doesn't even show how to do this.  
Lots of NAT/SNAT MASQ etc. but no simple block by IP (and protocol and/or
port).

So I've got it now and it's going into my cheap tricks collection.

As of some recent version of wine, the paths for windows drives are no
longer defined in ~/.wine/config. They are symlinks in
~/.wine/dosdevices/. I don't know where this is documented.

Evan,

  I now believe that I caused my problems by eliminating the 'Z:\' drive in
wine. That points to / and I knew nothing was going to happen there. But,
apparently wine demands that it exist. Shrug. I've left it in upon complete
re-installation.

  The immediate problem is that I have an old, custom program demo. The demo
starts just fine in wine. When I try to run one of the examples, however,
the demo executable calls a different executable and wine tells me that it
cannot [find/run] (I forget which) the second executable. This all works
well in VMware so I suspect that either it is user error or some aspect of
wine that's not fully implemented.

  Any ideas?

Thanks,

Rich

I second this.  Fedora Core 2 is untested, alpha-level research
technology, and has no business running on a production machine.
Fedora Core 2 is being directed by arrogant assholes who can't be
bothered to warn folks like you that their "distro" eats babies.

Use the information in the above weblink (Read it!  Don't ask us!)
to recover your data, then strip FC2 and use a distro designed for
average users.  SUSE, Xandros, or Mandrake if you want some paid
handholding, Fedora Core 1 or WhiteBox if you want free and Redhat
capability, Debian if you want free and help from most of us.  Others
will suggest other distros, but they should do so understanding that
you want help and their suggestion comes with some obligation to do so.

And lastly, to get at root in Knoppix, just type "su root" and then
carriage return when it asks for a password.  The Knoppix root 
password is blank.  Just make sure you know what you are doing; if
your XP data is a little scrambled by FC2 now, it can get far worse.
If your data is valuable to you, then hire somebody with real FC2
experience (like Alan) to recover it for you.

<Flame>
I'm sorry you had to learn about FC2 the hard way.  It is a pity
that some portion of the Linux development process, Fedora in
particular, has been taken over by user-haters.  How else to
explain that they won't update their release, or even put warnings
on the Fedora splash page.  Back when responsible people developed
Unix, you were expected to put a BUGs section in your documentation.

Fedora Core 2 - making Microsoft look good!

Not that I'm doubting the job... BUT... I find it hard to swallow that a
Technical Recruiter or even a new startup would utilize anything, but a good
e-mail address. 

Personally anything that says:

Send your Resume to this e-mail_address@<name_your_generic_account_here.com>

Is generally not serious. (This usually includes hotmail, yahoo, aol, etc..)

What do ya'll think?

  Hey, I'm not overly fond of yahoo mail accounts, either. However, I do
know of a trade association that uses one for mailings to the membership.
Not everyone is technologically astute.

  Perhaps this is a stand-alone recruiter who does not have her own domain
name.

Sorry, I didn't even read the thing. The xsequent group was intended 
primarily for "keeping the family together". Most job postings are 
legitimate. As Sequent was a unix (Dynix/ptx) company, I cross post when 
it appears to be relevant. This particular post brought considerable 
criticism there as well.

FWIW, I am doing this right now in order to consolidate snapshots onto
larger media.  I am doing so from two separate archive disks mounted
at /mnt2 and /mnt3 and writing the results to a new disk mounted at
/mnt.  Each of my snapshots are date-stamped in ISO format
YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.

First I create a list of the snapshots from the two source media and
then sort them chronologically:

  # find /mnt2/myhost -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 > /tmp/myhost-snapshots
  # find /mnt3/myhost -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 >> /tmp/myhost-snapshots
  # sort -t'/' -k 3 /tmp/myhost-snapshots > /tmp/myhost-snapshots-chron

Then use awk to generate an "almost correct" script, lagging the
snapshot link-dest directory variable:

  # awk -F/ '{ printf("time rsync -v -a -H --delete --numeric-ids --link-dest=../%s/ %s/ %s/\n",last,$0,$4); last = $4 }' /tmp/myhost-snapshots-chron > /tmp/recreate-snapshot-history-myhost.sh

Then I modified the first line to remove the link-dest parameter, and
starting from an appropriate current working directory (the new
destination of the snapshots), I run:

  # sh /tmp/recreate-snapshot-history-myhost.sh

and away it goes, recreating the snapshots in order, creating
hardlinks to the locally most recent previous snapshot. 

I don't know what else Dirvish does, but that recreates the basic
snapshot data, and in a timely fashion.

I had to do this recently and with the 3.4 version of Knoppix I would
open a terminal window in the GUI and type the following:


#su -    (to go to root user)

#<return> (if prompted for a password)

#umount /mnt/hda1 (unmount the partition if you double clicked on the
desktop and mounted it read only - knoppix default)

#mount /mnt/hda1 (mount as read/write by root.  default mount if you
do it as root in a shell)


Knoppix would unmount that partition if it was mounted.  It would then
mount that partition as /mnt/hda1 and with Write access.

I did notice that Knoppix will show you all the partitions and the
names it finds on the desktop.  You are logged in as Knoppix a basic
user so you need to do all the writes as root to the partitions.  I
did all my copying from a shell and it worked well.

Hope that helps. Also, as mentioned the root user has no password.

Knoppix doesn't set a root password, you should be able to just type
'su' on the command line (without the quotes) and become root.

Oops!  Wrong numeral!  Make that:

sync ; dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdc bs=1048576

The su command really isn't needed since if you go to the Knoppix menu 
off the main menu, you should see a Root window available.

Yeah, well... the kernel devs seem to be trying a similar approach.  :-\

Linux isn't going to be known as the stable platform it actually is.
It's like they're intentionally sabotaging things.  :-(

Sorry, I haven't been online much lately and assumed if I had run into
the article, everybody had.  My apologies:

http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/3513

So, essentially, the stable kernel is also the development kernel.

I agree.  Of course, I'm coming to the party a week and a half late.

FWIW, I run Apache 1.3.x with mod_php on my 16MB mini-server alongside
sshd, openvpn, postfix and bind.

When Pat V. moves to 2.x in Slackware, I'll probably upgrade.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0408151632200.19396@neon.netpro.to>

I just picked up a Shuttle case with a 2.4GHz P-4.  This little box
puts out quite a bit of heat.  The aluminum case is quite warm to
the touch.

So I was thinking of ways to cool this and I was wondering what other
people's experiences have been.  I'm particularly interested in
water-cooling systems.

The Shuttle case doesn't give much room for adding additional devices,
but if I could put a small device on the CPU with tubes running out
the back to a water pump, that might work.

Any suggestions?
Thanks,

Do it.

Check out www.hardforum.com's watercooling section.  Once you get past
the l33t0 bUrR1t0s you'll find a lot of good information.  These people
have actually *done* this kind of thing before.  :-)

Just be aware, it'll be very much a DIY type thing.  And, report back
what you end up doing.

Subject: [PLUG] Laptop recomendations
Message-ID: <1092628980.24057.69.camel@zontar.fnordora.org>

I am looking at (finally) getting another laptop to replace my dead
Vaio.

I have an idea of what I want, but I am interested in the general
opinions out there.

Here are my general thoughts:

IBM - These are long lasting, but I have concerns about the video
chipsets used.  (Intel Extreme Graphics or shared memory ATI in most
cases.)  They also lack the speed of some other vendors, as well as
hyperthread on the P4 chipsets.

Dell - Looks good. They use nVIDIA chipsets for the model I am looking
at, have hyperthread, and have a good warranty.  Not certain if I want
to deal with Dell support.

HP - They have Athlon 64 laptops.  They have very fast Intel laptops. 
The prices are cheap.  Not certain if I trust HP though since the
merger.  The video chipsets are nVIDIA and go up to 128 megs.  (Dell
only goes to 64megs.)  Concerned about quality and support of the
hardware.

Compaq - Same as HP.

Toshiba - Videochips on these such bad. Not even in the running.

Sony - They soak you for everything they can.  I don't really want to do
that again.

Any other comments? Ideas? Rants?

Fedora is not the only one with the problem.  It is a problem with later
versions of Grub.  All bleeding edge distros get bitten by this sort of
crap.

Hm, I haven't had any problems with my video chipset; it's an ATI
Mobility M.  You won't get hyperthreading on a Mobile P4, I don't think.
I guess the Centrino is an option now that there are open-source
wireless drivers,

Have you trusted the state of Oregon or a doctor to determine

Why not?  Excuse me if political correctness 
isn't something I care about much or have an 
endless aptitude for, unlike candidate Kerry.  
I believe some of these "fools" may very
well post to a list like this one.  We 
register sex offenders in computer 
databases, why not track seemy web 
sites or have a registry of URLs 
that sex offenders have used 
before?  I wouldn't stop there, there 
are many forms of illegal activity that 
the Internet can extend the reach of.  
Not to bemoan the Internet too much, 
it is an incredible tool for progress 
also.  Looking at Internet activity can 
be an extension of tracking criminals 
electronically  and informing communities 
when a person with a problem is moving in.

Porno web sites, especially if you watch
the news lately, are undeniably outlets 
for sexual predators.  We are an open 
society where it may be hard to shut
some of these sites down, but I disagree
with the view that nothing can or should 
be done about them at the state or national
level.

I don't see the difference between arguing 
for a sex offender database and tracking 
system verses negative Internet ratings 
against web sites promoting: 
prostitution, other sexual crimes, 
or pornography.  A sexual predator needs 
to sell pornography and he/she will often
return to whatever achieves that sale 
short of being denied the means.
  
This recent teenager runs off with known 
sex offender story should be a wake up call 
that hiding behind the first amendment
won't protect kids from Internet
extended sexual predators.

    I'm about had it with my Philips PCVC680K web cam.  It requires two 
drivers, one of which is closed source and needs to be 'forced' using 
insmod just to get it loaded into the kernel.  Now that I've upgraded to 
the 2.6 kernel it won't load at all (something about 'bad format').
   So I'm looking for a usb web cam that 'just works' in linux (or at

working).  I'm not looking for anything expensive; I just use it as a 
low end 'security camera'.  Any recommendations?

For the developers in the company I work for we got Dell Inspiron 5150's 
with 3.06GhZ Mobile Pentium 4 w/hyperthreading, 1GB memory, 7200 RPM 
hardrive, and 64MB nVIDIA GeForce 5200. They are very fast and all 
devices expect the Dell TrueMobile 1300 WIFI card was supported under 
Linux. I'm using the LinuxAnt Driver loader with the Broadcom Windows 
drivers for the WIFI card. The systems are great when they work but 
we've had nearly a 100% failure rate with this particular model of Dell 
laptops. I guess I don't care so much myself since it wasn't my money 
that paid for these systems. I'm considering getting my own laptop for 
my own uses and I have no plans to even consider Dell for a laptop when 
my own money is being used.

Our IT director at the office is not allowing anymore Dells into our 
company outside of the ones we already have and everyone outside of the 
developers are getting IBM laptops.  This is just my opinion of course.

I did see that HP was going to be offing an nx5000 laptop with Linux. 
There were some notes about the Intel Centrino chipset (2200BG) and the 
DVD/CD-RW drive not being supported in the multi-bay if Linux was used. 
I guess that's why HP recommends WinXP for that laptop.  The LinuxAnt 
driver loader supports the 2200BG chipset but I'm not sure about the 
lack of  multi-bay support. I have no experience with HP laptops and so 
I don't know if that makes the laptop useless or not. Certainly  I do 
consider WIFI essential in a laptop for myself. I also see on 
SourceForge.net that Intel has a communitiy project going for the 2200BG 
chipset and so there may be native drivers for the WIFI. I have no 
experience with HP and so I'm unsure about their laptop quality. 

YMMV,

Tony

You should upgrade the driver for your existing camera. Get PWC 9 here:

http://www.smcc.demon.nl/webcam/release.html

The compression (module pwcx) is still closed-source, but it comes as a
library that the module is linked against. So you build the module for
your kernel, eliminating any insmod -f troubles.

I use a the PWC/PWCX driver-supported camera at work for what will
eventually become a viewfinder on a telescope. Works great.

You can pick up an older Kodak DCxxx digital camera for pretty cheap
(<$50) on eBay. They have good old fasioned RS232 serial ports in them,
and there's even a set of Perl scripts floating around that allow you to
control pretty much all of the camera's functions from a remote host.

  My wireless company bought a couple of top-o-the-line Dell laptops last
year for our field staff.  We also purchased the top-o-the-line on-site
support contracts.  These would be "field" machines used in a rural
location.

  Both laptops arrived with a failure and needed to be fixed out of the box.
They also failed multiple times during use.  Tim's laptop has had every
component replaced, except the lower plastic case.  The motherboard has been
replaced three times.  The other machine has been more stable.  It has only
needed major repair a couple of times.  Dell *has* respected the high-end
maintenance contract.  They've sent a body on-site and fixed the problems
without complaint.  We only had to scream at a Customer Support supervisor a
couple of times.  

  Dell's telephone support system is an insane joke.  Your first calls get
forwarded to a call center in India.  If you're lucky, the person on the
other end both speaks *and* understands english.  If you're unlucky, the
person on the other end is speaking english phonetically and only
understands the words YES/NO.  They read phonetically from a script and wait
for your YES/NO answer.  This *can* work, but only if your problem is on
their script.  If not, weird things may happen.  They may ship a desktop
keyboard to replace your bad laptop keyboard, or some such silliness. (Don't
laugh... it happened to us!)  They also included a couple of sticks of
memory. Go figure?  

  If your problems (and you?) persist, you will finally get escalated to
call center with real english speaking staff.  Once you get your problem
correctly reported, hopefully they have parts and staff available.  We had
to wait for both.  

  In retrospective...  We'll continue to use the existing laptops.  We
thought about scrapping them for a while.  Dell's tech support *did* finally
come through and resolve all the problems.  I believe the high failure rate
of the hardware and the insane telephone support is enough justification to
look elsewhere.

We were discussing a few months ago USB<->RS-232 serial adapters.  I

I am using it with a 2.6 kernel; however, it's a USB v1.1 device, so

Or 'bs=1024k' or 'bs=1m'.  Looks like dd knows about GiB, too.

The Ultrabay backup HDD is one of the niftier things about owning a
Thinkpad.  I wonder if e2image could be used to speed up the backup
process by restricting it to the disc space actually being used.

I don't have experience with ATi laptop chips, but the reports I've seen
suggest they work reasonably well. They are forthcoming with enough
information to have a working driver for X (actually of the big graphics
chip companies they're the best in this aspect). I've seen mentions that
their driver binary for Linux isn't that good though.

Avoid any system with an Intel graphics chip. They're neither providing
enough information to support Linux, nor helping with any sort of driver.
There is a driver for X that sort of works, but there isn't enough
information available to make it work well. Notably the driver cannot
directly change resolutions and often the BIOSes don't have data on the
resolution of the screen, resulting in really nasty hacks to get laptop
screens to work well.

Get the per-page no execute bits!  :-)

Though nVIDIA hasn't been very forthcoming with information on how to
program their chips, their drivers work very well (both their "nv" driver
with source, and their binary driver).

The propietary issues might be too much for you, but thought about Apple

Their spec documents are usually fairly bad.  (According to Keith Packard 
they write the document first, design the chip, then never go back and 
correct anything that changed during development.)

I am also kind of pissed at them because their binary drivers (needed for 
some features) do not support thier entire currently shipping product 
line.  (Like the 7000 i bought my daughter.)

They have drivers, they are just not easy to get at.  (You have to search 
on their web site or just luck out.)  They are supposed to be supported as 
an extension to the i810 driver.  My concern is that every Intel graphics 
chipset i have dealt with has been dirt slow.

My concern is if they are reliable hardware.  I have not gotten a good

I have been very happy with their drivers.

  And now that folks have dissected the video chips and drivers I'll chirp
up and suggest contacting one of the companies that specialize in selling
portables with linux pre-installed and working. As I've written before, the
folks at Emperor Linux make sure everything works, provide outstanding
support and will install the distribution of your choice. Let them do the
research, worrying and tweaks to make everything work.

  They sell an IBM ThinkPad model that won Linux Journal's Product of the
Year for the category of portable machines; it's the one Doc Searls hauls
all over the country and he sang the praises of both the hardware and
Emperor Linux.

  There are other such companies advertising in LJ but I have experience
only with Emperor Linux. Very highly recommended.

The type of work I am going to be doing on the laptop requires me to wipe 
the drive on occasion.  

I am used to getting weird hardware to work.  Remember i had a Sony Vaio.

I have been tempted.  It is just hard when i can get an Athlon 64 laptop 
at more than twice the speed and half the money fdrom HP.

  That's true, Alan. You know what you're doing and you enjoy futzing with
the hardware and software.

  I have a Sony Vaio, the PCG-V505BC, and so far I've been satisfied with
it. My lack of overwhelming enthusiasm is due to the ergonomics, not the
form factor or software.

  True. I would have preferred an Athlon (or Duron or Moron) but EL doesn't
have any available. Lack of demand from customers.

Fellows,

I need an 802.11g WiFi router for my personal Comcast cable connection,
and I would indeed appreciate a few recommendations:

  - Four+ RJ-45 jacks.
  - Flexible firewall with a decent interface.
  - Good range (I've heard the two-antennae models are best).
  - I'm not even sure what other features there are to consider.

Basically, I'm getting too much information on this, and I'm hoping one
or two models have gained general favor.  Price isn't critical, but I'm
just looking for a home model, less than, say, $80.

Thanks,

With the involvement in the community I see on the list this seemed like
the perfect place to ask about Housing & Urban Development and Rural
Development software.  I'm looking for NOT Windows/DOS (obviously) and
open source if possible.

I have a friend/client that admins some HUD properties and the software is
ancient and DOS based.  She's been lucky so far but the next desktop
system upgrade will probably put the skids to her using Win95 and Win98.

I'd prefer Client/Server based so she can use whatever for the desktop 
(and I will, someday, get her to Linux).

Any ideas where else to look.  Google, Freshmeat and SourceForge were
pretty much busts but since this is pretty esoteric software I didn't
expect much.


TIA,

Subject: [PLUG] Security of Knoppix?
Message-ID: <20040817023611.GA25385@gate.kl-ic.com>

I just told someone that boot-from-CD Knoppix is pretty secure from
network attack (if not silly-user-enabled attack).  Then it occured to
me that I wasn't really sure.  When I boot a knoppix 3.4 CD on a box,
dhcp'ing onto my internal net, then nmap it, I see these two ports open:

68/tcp    open  dhcpclient
6000/tcp  open  X11

The first is for renewing dhcp leases, the second is for X11, which
starts up with /etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc set to  -nolisten .

This seems to leave the machine close to bulletproof.  Of course, if
a blackhat somehow manages to get in, they can run rampant on the
(non-executable) hard drive, and in general do difficult tweaks to
the runtime environment and the programs that are running in RAM. 
They might even snag the user's passwords with a keyboard monitor
program (though a man-in-the-middle attack seems more likely).  But in
general, a Knoppix on a CD seems like a pretty difficult target to
attack, compared to a writeable system offering services to the world. 
Especially if that is some breed of windoze ...

Am I missing something?  Have there been any recent Knoppix security
compromises?

What does this software *do*, exactly?  It may be fairly easy to

Any one you please, honestly.  In my experience, they all work nicely
and have a clean web interface that works with any modern web browser.

You might like a Linksys WRT54G, because there's nice community-
developed Linux-based mesh-networking firmware for it, but otherwise,
get whatever's on sale.  (see http://fatwallet.com)

Good luck,

That thread is a pretty strong recommendation against using Intel
graphics hardware.

Dunno about their speed though. They're not aiming to take the hardcore
market, but they are fast enough for the generic people. I'd expect
reasonable though not great 2D speed, otherwise they'd have even less of
the market then they do. Forget about 3D and the higher-level graphics
processing (MPEG/Xv) on Intel.

Isn't that an argument for Apple? Host-byte order being network-byte

  There's a CRM called "hermes", I think this is the one, focusing on the
hotel market. I'm willing to bet that folks on the sql-ledger mail list have
some ideas about this.

  I can probably be more useful, Rod, if you explain _what_ the software is

And if nonprofits use it, there may be grant money to get it written.
That said, most DOS-based software runs really nicely in emulation.

  I thought of recommending this but I didn't recall whether or not it has a

I've had a DLink and 2 Linksys routers.  They both have options that I 
like so it's hard to pick one over the other.  The only issue I've run 
into with the Linksys, one was my own fault for upgrading the firmware 
via a wireless connection instead of a cable connection.  Oops, oh well 
it's only money.  :-)

Well, if it's got a modifiable firmware image, you can always just write

This is probably coming too late, but, IIRC, dump/restore scales very nicely
with disk size and has little problem with many, many inodes.  Of 
course, the
downside to dump is that it is safe only when the filesystem is 
unmounted (or
mounted read-only).

I thought I saw something a while about linksys having a security
problem.  I don't recall the details but I do know one of them came up
as having a security hole.

Subject: [PLUG] Resolver going to DNS for private IP reverse lookups, flagrantly
 ignoring /etc/hosts?
Message-ID: <41225088.6070404@tercent.com>

Hi folks,

I've got some Red Hat ES2.1 (RH7.3 but not free) boxes that FTP things 
to each other over a private IP network (eg 192.168.0.x) via an 
automated process using Net::FTP with a 30 second timeout.

95% of time time, it connects super fast with no problems. 
Non-deterministically, the other 5% or so, it times out.

A few years ago I had a problem with a similar process -- the ftpd was 
doing a reverse lookup and going out to DNS to do so.  I'm afraid it may 
be doing this again.

I have the private IPs listed in /etc/hosts, but when I use "host 
192.168.0.1", it goes out to DNS and either times out or gives me:

Host 1.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)

The resolver shouldn't be going to DNS at all for that IP -- it's in my 
/etc/hosts and I've got order hosts,bind in my /etc/host.conf.  (For the 
record, the hosts can and do get out to the internet for DNS lookups).

Is there something I'm doing wrong with this?  I plan to change the 
process to use scp but it's unsettling that venerable and standard tools 
aren't working.

Best,

Randall

Are you sure host.conf is used by the resolver?  I think that glibc may
be using nsswitch.conf for name resolution.

First, host only does DNS lookups.  It is the simple version of dig.
The DNS resolver only looks at /etc/resolv.conf.

/etc/host.conf controls where gethostbyname looks.  Unluckily, there
is no standard utility for doing queries with gethostbyname.
/etc/nsswitch.conf is the newer file for controlling where to look.  I
am not sure how they interact but my impression is that latter takes
precedence.  What does the hosts: line /etc/nsswitch.conf look like?

Also, make sure the syntax in /etc/hosts is correct.  I have seem
problems when this is not right.  It should look like:

192.168.1.10 hostname hostname.domain

First though, I'll get back to all about the HUD/RD softwarein the next
few days.  The workie monster grabbed me for a bit.

Now to the iptables question.

Do deny/drop/reject rules come before or after the accept rules.

Short story.  I'm still getting the script kiddies pounding at my sshd 
port and the sshd_config setting still lets them try to log in but never 
validates them.  My preference would be to block all port 22 connections 
except for two or three addresses or address ranges.

So should I deny all, then accept the few I want; or accept the few, then 
deny the rest, or just accept the few?


Thanks,
Rod

If I understand this right <and I have been wrong (ask the MRS)>

A single ALLowUsers Keyword in the configuration file cuts off SSH access for 
all other accounts not mentioned.

  AllowUsers
             This keyword can be followed by a list of user name patterns,
             separated by spaces.  If specified, login is allowed only for
             user names that match one of the patterns.  '*' and ''?  can be
             used as wildcards in the patterns.  Only user names are valid; a
             numerical user ID is not recognized.  By default, login is
             allowed for all users.  If the pattern takes the form USER at HOST
             then USER and HOST are separately checked, restricting logins to
             particular users from particular hosts.

Good Luck

Rules are explicitly ordered in the chains.  So:
  1. Accept the IP addresses you want to allow
  2. Deny the rest

Rod,

  My understanding -- and the way I'm set up here -- is that deny is the
default and is listed first. Then I accept me as a legitimate ssh user:

#
# Policy for chains DROP everything
#

iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP

# SSH:

iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp -d ${OUTSIDE_IP} --dport 22 -j DNAT --to ${SERVER_IP}:22
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -d ${SERVER_IP} --dport 22 -o ${INSIDE_DEVICE} -j ACCEPT

  I let /etc/sshd.conf handle who's allowed in.

  Glad you mentioned this. I've noticed that the past few weeks has brought
a flood of attempts for "user", "test", "guest" and selected other usernames
via ssh2. Almost all from Japan and Korea. I wondered if others were seeing
the same flood.

  It used to be that attempts to crack the system were sporatic and
infrequent. Now they occur almost every day and the same IP address may try
a dozen times or more before giving up and going off to play elsewhere.
Harmless, but still not my preference to see in my daily log summaries.

Too bad you weren't at the advanced topics meeting last month.  The locally

I recommend this box, with the EWRT you've got a console session on it.

I see them every day also Rich.  I have banned some IP's but is too
much work to continue to do that.  Maybe a rule to ban automatically
from ssh if they try some list of users?  No idea how that would work
but would be nice.  I could just add 'test' 'admin' 'root' 'guest' and
others as I saw them.

So if I understand this correctly, on one of my RHL systems, if I have
these lines in the /etc/sysconfig/iptables

-A RH-Lokkit-0-50-INPUT -s 1.2.3.0/255.255.255.0   -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
-A RH-Lokkit-0-50-INPUT -s 4.5.6.7/255.255.255.255 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

-A RH-Lokkit-0-50-INPUT -s 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0  -p tcp --dport 22 -j REJECT

Will allow the C-Class 1.2.3.0 in as well as the single IP 4.5.6.7 and all 
the rest of network gets rejected.  While off doing something else for a 
bit Rich mentioned doing a deny first then the allows.

That's correct.  A -j jump interrupts rule-processing and unless the
jumped-to chain has a 'RETURN' jump, it ends there.

That doesn't work.  Perhaps he meant "deny all except ...".

No, the default policy might be listed first, but the default policy is
what happens *last*, if no other rules apply.  I generally don't use the
default policy, because it give me the opportunity to log.

'jumped-to' chain as in REJECT, DROP, DENY, ALLOW but is the next rule
still processed?  Say one that allows or denys SMB/CIF connections.

Heck I'm just going to do it and see what happens.  Worst case I have to 
walk to the NOC and access the machine from the console.

Thanks Wil.  (I'm still working at the PTB to use the SnapGear filewall

That is correct. It would also work to say:
-A RH-Lokkit-0-50-INPUT --dport 22 -j REJECT
If all you want to do is deny all port 22 connects that have not already
been accepted.

A better technique is to put a "Log-and-Drop" routine in and call it to
document the offending packets.

That sounds way cool.

Although, I only want an end-user relationship with this device,

For ~$65, the WRT54G will do, but I'll look into DLink as well.

No, the default for a called (jumped to) routine is to return to the rule

Once a packet matches a rule that jumps to REJECT, DROP, DENY, or ALLOW,
netfilter takes that action and stops going through the rules.

>From 'man iptables':

TARGETS
       A firewall rule specifies criteria for a packet, and  a
       target.  If the packet does not match, the next rule in
       the chain is the examined; if it does match,  then  the
       next  rule  is  specified  by  the value of the target,
       which can be the name of a user-defined chain or one of
       the special values ACCEPT, DROP, QUEUE, or RETURN.

       ACCEPT  means to let the packet through.  DROP means to
       drop the packet on the floor.  QUEUE means to pass  the
       packet  to  userspace  (if  supported  by  the kernel).
       RETURN means stop traversing this chain and  resume  at
       the  next rule in the previous (calling) chain.  If the
       end of a built-in chain is  reached  or  a  rule  in  a
       built-in  chain with target RETURN is matched, the tar-
       get specified by the chain policy determines  the  fate
       of the packet.

Wil, Charles;

You guys rock.  I did the "more explicit" method and it worked great.  
Now to try the "better" way from above.

  One small correction.  It needs to be 
	-A RH-Lokkit-0-50-INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j REJECT
  (with the -p tcp)

Think of it as a test.  Took about seven tries to figure it out.

Here is her message to me.

===
The software requirements are specific for the program that the apartment
complex is goverened under. As you know dealing with the government
nothing is the same and each housing program has just a little different
requirement. It must be able to certify households for income standards,
expense items (when allowed) and household members qualifications.

Some of the government housing program names are HUD Section 8 and Section
202, Tax Credit, Home Program, Rural Development 515 - Family and Elderly.

I am aware of a software company called Yardi Systems in the Dallas area
that produces and supports the software for these programs.  However, our
initial research shows that they are very expensive and I prefer a package
that will support multiple properties and multiple housing programs.

My understanding is that Rural Development will be coming out with a new
handbook after the election which will possible have an impact on the
software requirements---When HUD had a handbook change in June of 2003,
there was a impact on the software providers at that time.

Well this company is for profit.  They manage the properties.

Well this suffers from too much DOS or possibly poor programming tools.  
I've dealt with a lot of these DOS programs before and they may work great 
but any thing goes wrong or needs to be changed you're in deep stuff.

So for now I'll wait and do some more research and look at the program 
more indepth.

Subject: [PLUG] Mouse Question
Message-ID: <4122A93E.4090008@comcast.net>

I have RH 8 on my laptop and Debian Woody on this machine. On this 
machine, when I attempt to move the mouse slowly, the pointer doesn't 
move at all. As I increase the speed with which I move it, the pointer 
moves. This becomes a problem when I get close to, but not on top of 
something like the edge of a window that I want to resize. I don't have 
this problem with my laptop.

Is there some difference in the mouse support for Debian vs RH? I've 
tried adjusting the acceleration, sensitivity, and threshold settings of 
the Debian mouse properties, but they don't appear to relate to this 
problem.

Any ideas on why this works this way would be appreciated.

Yeah... not exactly as 'descriptive' as I might have hoped.

So, does the software go out and certify the houses in person?  Does it
just list requirements for certification?  Does it cryptographically
sign a picture of the house?

Which means nothing to most everybody.

I would have to say the odds are pretty low you'll find anything out
there to do what you want if you never list exactly what it is you
want.  :-)

I think the odds are pretty darned low of finding an OSS developer who
would write such specialized software for a for-profit company for free.

Yeah, pretty much.  OO is a huge monstrosity that eats much RAM and CPU.
It's a slow SOB, but it works.

BTW, when you just hit 'reply' and change the subject, you aren't

Well, considering that the purpose of modern government seems to be to
maintain the profitability of large corporations in order to ensure
existing economic relationships remain intact, we, unfortunately, pay
exactly what it costs.

Optical mouse: yes. Black surface: no. The desktop is a light gray small 
pebble laminate.

This mouse is connected to the computer through a KVM switch. The other 
machine is a Win98 box. On the Win98 machine, the mouse performs 
normally, i.e., when I move the mouse really slowly, the mouse pointer 
moves really slowly.

I used to use a mouse on the laptop, but it's long enough ago that I 
don't remember for sure whether there was a problem with it. Now, I just 
use the trackpoint stick. In any event, I've never used this optical 
mouse on that laptop.

It was actually pretty good.  Ya wanna full requirements analysis, ya
pays for one.  That said, it sounds like a piece of small-market
specialty software with regulatory requirements.  Kinda like a tax and
accounting package, but with a minuscule market.  Typically something
that'd be written by a tiny company in some RAD or DB language.

I'll be nice when there's a good, capable, cross-platform RAD system for
such projects.  There's a lot of Clipper, Fox and Access apps out there
that'll need replacement sooner or later.

To everyone taking sides in this thread, why don't all of us take a step back,
count to ten, & continue this discussion over in PLUG-Talk? It has obviously
drifted away from Linux & the topics concerning UNIX-like Operating systems.

Convert RAID0 to RAID5: Theoretically? Maybe. Practically? No.

However, what you are describing is RAID4, actually. In RAID5, parity
is distributed across all of the drives, so a conversion process would
have to very carefully restripe all the data row by row. RAID4 support
does exist in the kernel. What you might try, if you really want to
pursue this, is to try modifying the configuration to describe your
existing array as a degraded RAID4 array missing its other drive. Then
hot add the new drive and watch it rebuild. In theory. Possibly.

  While the description was not as complete as what _we'd_ expect in a
project specification, I think the needs came through very clearly: an
application that validates both properties AND potential renters against the
various regulatory criteria under different HUD and RD programs.

  I pictured the solution as a postgres backend with a GUI front end. The
database schema would not be difficult to define after clarifying
requirement details. The reports to be generated (probably on a quarterly
basis) are most likely those that verify the managment company is keeping
their properties in compliance with all applicable regulations and that all
tenants are properly qualified. The Azzurri "Clay" plugin to Eclipse would
make developing the schema very quick and simple.

  Seems to me that java would fit the need. Use it for the UI and middleware
and use the power of postgres for the backend.

  And, therefore, their need to document compliance with currnet and
changing regulations. When you're part of the regulated community you gotta'
know the regs better than do the regulators and you need to protect yourself
by proactively demonstrating compliance.

> Was Roderick really asking for that?  Heck, ya gotta pay OSS devs to

  I doubt it. This is a matter of value: demonstrate the value that the
solution brings to the management company and they'll happily pay for it.
They know the potential costs of not being on top of the regulations. That's
why Rod's friend asked for help.

You're right, it didn't make any difference.

I have another problem with this machine, about which I'll start another 
thread. I haven't moved onto it, yet, for everyday use. That's the goal, 
and whether I stick with Debian, or move to another distro is still an 
open question. I might just try replacing the Debian install with the 
same RH 8 install I have on my laptop, just to see if it makes any 
difference on the mouse. Then move on to my other issues.

  Reading this again makes me realize that your assmption is probably
incorrect, Aaron. Take a look at the federal budget and I'll bet there are
billions of dollars for public housing and housing assistance. I suspect
that such software would have a rather large market.

  Last week at the OEF Pub Talk we heard a presentation by a principal in a
company that developed and is selling practice managment/insurance billing
systems (all under winduhs, unfortunately) _only_ to phyical and
occupational therapy clinics. This small segment of the medical industry is
estimated by them to be worth about $10 billion. Because the patients aren't
covered by the normal medical billing systems this has been rather chaotic
for both practitioner and patient. I forget the exact numbers but they have
a continuous base of about $1.5 million per month -- in their first half-year
of being in business.

  I suspect that the market for quality linux-hosted HUD/RD managment
software is at least as large. As a matter of fact, it is exactly these
smaller (i.e., less than $1 billion) markets that the major players ignore
but the smart smaller company could exploit for great profit.

  Want another niche market looking for a low-cost solution with a huge
potential client base? Take a look at precision farming. In my discussions
with wheat farmers I've learned that they would love to have such a system
if they could equip each tractor and combine with a high-precision GPS
receiver, hardened notebook computer and GIS software at a very low cost.
GRASS would do for the latter. Someone could probably build an integrated,
single-board GPS receiver/single-purpose computer that is shock- and
dust-proof and sell the hardware to someone(s) developing the precision-
farming application using linux, GRASS and PostgreSQL. Huge market.
International.

  Think small to think big.

Subject: [PLUG] Resolver going to DNS for private IP reverse lookups,
 flagrantly ignoring /etc/hosts?
Message-ID: <41239775.2020306@tercent.com>

Thanks for the previous replies on this issue.

wu-ftpd seemed to be intractably using DNS for reverse lookups, ignoring 
hosts.  I think this problem was covered up before because my upstream 
DNS provider was quickly failing on the private IP reverse lookup, but 
must have changed their config so that ~ 10% or so of the time it slowly 
fails.

My workaround was to install vsftpd in standalone (listen=YES) mode, 
which seemed to solve the problem.  I don't know if vsftpd just doesn't 
bother with reverse lookup, or if it uses /etc/hosts, but either way, 
FTP once again answers speedily.

Regards,

Randall

Rob,

  It not only lists the certification requirements but it lists the renters
and the documentation that they presented (and the company verified) that
qualifies them for the program. So the management company can quickly
produce a report of who lives where, under which program(s) they qualified
and how they proved they are OK. Also, how many people/families produce a
certain proof document would be of interest to the government.

  This is a database application. Could probably be associated with
SQL-Ledger, too, to show who's paid rent on time, who's late and so on.

  But, if you were interested in helping them you'd have references to learn
more via the Web.

  She did list it, Rob.

> Ah, so the whole point is pretty much moot right now, anyway?

  No. If the application is properly written then any rule changes are
incorporated as a new relation. Current renters can be re-qualified under
the new requirements and new ones will be qualified only under the current
ones. A query can reveal a renter's history as well as the management
company's compliance with all regulations so they get paid on time by HUD.

  Sure. How about for pay? It looks to me like the manangement company has a
great need and is in a lot of pain. A competent provider not only has this
one job but continuing work keeping the software current as regulations and
reporting requirements change. The advantages to the management company are
that they don't pay for the software, just the skill and effort of the
developer and they don't have a trap if the developer decides to go off and
windsurf or something else for a living. Other qualified developers can step
right in and take it over.

I'm at work, away from my REAL machine, and I'd like to get this
information to Mike before this evening when I'd be able to look for it.

Mozilla Mail.  Where are the messages stored (POPd back not IMAP) and any
other files/directories that should be backed-up?  Or is there an export 
process that makes more sense.

We're going to upgrade his system this weekend and go to SuSE from Fedora 
Core 1.  The FC1 was an upgrade from RHL 7.x and it wasn't as smooth as 
it should have been so we're going for a clean install of SuSE.


TIA,

I'm going to have to dissent against Chris. Quite possible, even easy
though not entirely safe to do exactly what you're proposing. His point
is valid though, you can fairly easily convert the system to RAID4.

Do a hot removal of sda3 from the RAID0 set, this will leave sdb2 as an
unmirrored copy of your data. Now, remark sda3 and sdc1 as part of
RAID5 amoungst 3 drives, and tell Linux to initialize that RAID set.
Once it is reported as online, though degraded (one disk is missing).
Now move the data from md0/sdb2 to md1. Once this step is down delete
md0, now remark sdb2 as being part of md1 and then do a hot add. The
three should get synched up and you'll be on your way.

There are two major dangers. First, during this procedure you don't have
any copies so if the system dies, you're toast. Second, be VERY careful
with the Linux-RAID commands, miss a step or type the wrong thing and
your data WILL be toast.

Um. RAID0. This will leave his data as dead and gone.

Woah, woah, woah.

RAID0 is striping, not mirroring.  You're thinking RAID1.

Don't do this, Scott!

Excellent.  I'm running in too many directions at work right now so I 
was hoping some one had already run into this.

I have another message on my phone from Mike saying he has other "strange" 
things happening with his system.  Hopefully it isn't a pebkac error he's 
reporting.


Thanks,

  I just discovered something interesting that may be useful to others who
run winduhs applications in VMware. I need screen captures of plots
generated by the fuzzy system modeling software (it's not yet ported to
java; that's next) for inclusion in my book. So, I fire up a copy of The
GIMP and disocover that it will not do a screen capture of the VMware window
with the application in it. "Cannot open WMD" is the message. Well, I don't
want weapons of mass destruction, but a screen shot. The GIMP just won't
give it to me. At least, not the version running on my RH 7.3 box here.

  So I cranked up xv and it did just fine. It will produce only a .gif, but
The GIMP opens that nicely and saves the cropped image as .eps very well.

  Strange that The GIMP-1.1 wouldn't touch the window but xv took it all in
stride.

NO.. It saves it to the clipboard.

You need to open paint and save it to a file in "Winders"

gimp-2.0.4-0.fc2.1 took a screen capture OK.

Clipboard. I believe Ctrl-PrtScrn can capture just one window, too.

Wil,

  The application I'm running neither has that on its "File" menu nor
responds to a shift-PrtScr key press. Sux.

Marvi,

  I don't think I have 'paint' in my virtual win98. Anyway, as I responded
to Wil's suggestion, there's no response to shift-PrtSc and nothing on the
application menu do do a screen print. Heck, when it has the plot display
window open I can't access the "File" menu at all.

  But, using xv and massaging the resulting image with GIMP does just fine.

Thanks,

Rich

  Ctrl- does no better than shift- . Nada. Comatose. Waits for me to close
the window with the plot before it's again responsive. Then, of course, I
cannot capture the plot.

  Well, it was written for a different category of problems than I need to
solve so I'm not surprised. Besides, it was written by a couple of
academicians starting about 1984 and is a amalgam of C, C++, documented
files and others without a single comment. When I asked the original author
(who's 85 years old now) what a couple of undocumented functions were
supposed to do he replied, "I've no idea. It's been too long and I've
forgotten." So, gotta' figure out the code in other ways.

But Wil was talking about asking VMWare to capture the screen, not the
application you're running.  VMWare has a menu bar, doesn't it?

You lucky dog.  I've been trying to find a FC1 RPM of Gimp 2.  I loaded it 
(G2) on the Windows system I use at work and are the new features slick.  
If you hear of a FC1 RPM keep me in mind.  I'm not ready to jump on the 
FC2 wagon just yet.

Hmm, reasons why backing up one's data beforehand is a good thing.  %-)

OTOH it would make implementing an online conversion program that much
easier.

Great idea.  I'm going to try that tonight.  I don't have Rick's problem
but I do enjoy Gimp 2 and generally putzing around in VMware.  Best part
is I don't get any BSODs.

Just grab the FC2 source RPM and rebuild it on FC1. I don't have any FC1
boxes left on which to try that, but IIRC that worked w/ a 2.0.x version
out of rawhide, nee development.

Or maybe I used this:

There will definitely be a session in September. Luckily for us the
Chunkathalon - http://dclxvi.org/chunk/ - doesn't fall on the same date or

I was looking at the possiblity ehen broke my FC1 with nVidia video a few
days ago.  The plan completely went away when I couldn't use X-Windows.  
Now fixed. (A interesting story I'll probably relate after I get over the 
trama and out of therapy.)

I may be confusing Gimp2 version 1 with Gimp2 version 2.  But that URL si
for Gimp2 version 1.3.23.  I'm looking for "theGIMP 2.0.2" or close.

To the FC2 src I go.

1.3 was the development version that became 2.0.

No, I mean the File menu of VMware itself, not your application.

Debian woody uses X 4.1, RH probably uses X 4.3. (This is assuming that
you've got an X4 video card, and not an old video card which would be
using X3 on either distribution) There are some fairly significant
differences between 4.1 and 4.3. You could try installing X from sarge
by doing this:

in /etc/apt/sources.list
edit where it says woody into sarge (or stable -> sarge)
apt-get update
apt-get install xserver-xfree86

and then try the mouse issue. If you want to go full on sarge, now is a
good time, as it's stabilizing and intends to be stable this year. If
so, leave your sources.list the way you changed it to, and

apt-get dist-upgrade

How fast of a network is it sitting on?  Since it's only a maximum of 
18gb of data why not back it up to another machine, add the new drive to 
create a raid5 set, restore back.

One problem I have run into with wu-ftpd is that it tries to do an ident 
lookup on the incoming connection so it can log the username that is 
connecting.  Except ident is rarely used any more and doesn't give 
reliable information.  It just slows things down especially when the 
connection is firewalled.  There is an option to wu-ftpd, -I, that turns 
this off.  With xinetd, it can be added to server_args line in the 
/etc/xinetd.d/wu-ftpd file.

vsftpd is a better FTP server in any case.

Or install the GIMP in "Winders", and paste it in there.

think VMware would pass that key sequence through.

In the case where I'm doing this DROP'd is what I need to do since I can't 
CANE, WHIP, or TORTURE.  Everyone learns to deal with REJECTion.  Stupid 
behavior should hurt. (You've all heard the one about the difference 
between; dumb, ignorant and stupid ... right?)

Thanks Jeff.  As I see it's working -- I son't see them in my logreports 
-- I planned on refining stuff a bit.  THis will make a good change.

This is my preferred means of getting Windows screenshots when running
VMware.  It saves as BMP format in whichever directory you tell it.  GIMP
works fine on these files.

Where can I find a list of video cards that work with X4? I tried:

http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO.html#VIDEO

and found my card,

Real3D Starfighter AGP, Intel 740, XF86_SVGA, i740

but that is from, "a list of cards known to work with XFree86 versions 
3.3.6 and/or 4.1.0." I got this machine from a friend. The date on the 
video firmware is 08/21/97, and I'm pretty sure the whole machine dates 
from around that time. It's a Micron Millenia, 400 MHz Pentium II. I 
think my friend had Win95 on it -- at least, that's the CD he gave me 
with it. My laptop is a bit newer, a circa 1999 IBM Thinkpad 390, with a 
400 MHz Celeron.

Funny you should mention that. I've been trying to make that work for a 
few weeks, and have gotten to the stage where lilo has two options at 
boot time. There's a problem with the virtual file system, or something 
like that, and the boot fails.

As I said in a previous post, I'm going to start a new thread, since 
this is more than just a mouse question.

Subject: [PLUG] Upgrading from Woody to Sarge
Message-ID: <4124CB68.6000107@comcast.net>

I successfully installed Debian Woody on this machine. I asked some 
other folks for advice on getting my HP SureStore CD burner working and 
learned that the 2.6 kernel would deal with it without having to make it 
seem like a SCSI device. So, I've been trying to upgrade the kernel for 
a few weeks now, and have run into a problem they were unable to solve.

I have a 2.6.7 kernel compiled and I have lilo configured to the point 
where I get a menu when I boot. If I select the 2.2.20 kernel the system 
boots just fine. If I select the 2.6.7 kernel, I get the following message:

      VFS: Cannot open root device "301" or unknown-block(3,1)
      Please append a correct "root=" boot option.

In lilo.conf I have:

      boot=/dev/hda
      root=/dev/hda1

Any ideas on where to start looking?

Dick,

  Is the above root line associated with both stanzas? On my hosts the boot
line is in the global section but the root line is associated with each
kernel available to be loaded.

The entry for the kernel, did you create an initrd image?  If not, lilo
may still be looking for one.

This looks a lot like the error I've gotten when I build a kernel with
initrd support, and then provide no initrd for the kernel to mount at
boot-time. I think if you compile a new kernel "the Debian way" (i.e.,
with make-kpkg), then the new initrd is created automatically.
Or you could just re-compile without initrd support. Hopefully someone
else can provide more insight...

Just wanted to let you wankers who didn't come to the Advanced Topics

Tridgell, the man responsible for the creation of Samba.  Just think
of the *lives* this man has saved, rescued from dealing with Windows
file servers.  He probably single-handedly enhanced the deployment of
Linux by an order of magnitude or more.  On top of that, he is the
inventor of rsync.  Just standing next to him, the radiation of "gifts
to humanity" coming off the guy was the equivalent of 10 chest x-rays.

While discussing some strange rsync behavior with Eric Harrison, he
launched off on an explanation of a little debugging device he uses, a
LD_PRELOAD hack called segv_handler.  You have your application
preload the segfault hander function and if/when the program
segfaults, the handler causes a gdb to attach to the still running
process and print a backtrace to a tmp file.  He has a whole archive
of what he calls "junkcode", which is mostly available at:

  <http://junkcode.samba.org/>

Of all the stuff he chatted about, he was *really* jazzed about his
junkcode stuff.  His enthusiasm was amazing!

Hi.

I'd like to ask this question without causing a major flamefest. (fat
bloody chance, right?)

At work we're fairly mandated to use redhat 9.0. That's ok, it's one
more
distribution that I get experience with. I have kde and gnome
installed, and I'd like to try one of the more "lightweight" "window
managers" because, frankly, even on my newish computer, sometimes KDE
slows to a crawl.

I've heard good things about Enlightenment and FVWM.

I presume it's possible to try them out- do I just do a "up2date -i
enlightenment" to get E, and if so, which of these two "window
managers" will confuse a "desktop user (kde and a little gnome)" less?
Which one will have menus for my common programs (galeon, firefox,
gvim/vi, evolution, etc) or easily are easily configured to have such.
I think I see where to change my "Window Manager" but I can't do it
yet (It has options for KDE, Gnome and Sawfish).

Hmm, I don't have that problem on my system, and I use it as a server.
I run KDE plus a *lot* of other stuff, and KDE is really snappy and
responsive on my 1.2GHz machine overclocked to 1.6GHz.  What brings KDE
to it's knees for you?

You should talk with them about this choice since Red Hat 9.0 is no longer
patched/supported by Red Hat.  You may be able to get some patches from
the Fedora Legacy project, but this volunteer-driven effort often misses
patches.

Another option is to get White Box Linux 3, which is a Red Hat Enterprise
3 clone.  ES3 is much like Red Hat 9.

I suspect this is due to KDE more than your window manager.  Changing out
the window manager w/o removing KDE probably won't help a bunch.  Removing
KDE and using something else is possible, but will be a fairly extensive
project.

Russ,

  Take a look at Xfce-4 <http://www.xfce.org/>.

  As far as I'm concerned it has the same capabilities of KDE and Gnome to
run applets; as a matter of fact it will happily run KDE and Gnome applets,
too.

  It will not search your disk and automatically set up the panel and menus
for you. But, it's very easy to set up. There's a panel, taskbar and icons;
the last two are optional. I keep 10 virtual desktops available so I'm
running only 1 or 2 of my regular apps on each one.

  I've never used KDE or Gnome (except at the clinics) so I cannot do more
of a comparison. I like it. YMMV.

Rich

I had that problem, too (though I was using Ximian).  I switched to Fluxbox
http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net/ and have been very pleased with it.

Here's a screenshot of my desktop:  http://users.easystreet.com/ovid/images/ovid_desktop.jpeg

For some reason, some of my boxes have let me just do "switchdesk fluxbox", but usually I have to
edit .Xclients-default to get it to work.

After you install it, be sure to run fluxbox-generate_menu to get your menus.  Also, the
screenshot I show is using the devel version of fluxbox, though I've found it to be very stable.

Cheers,
Ovid

I've experienced this problem with KDE at times. Everytime it
happened, I had a few kdeinit processes running and they ran
forever until I killed them.

Just to clarify, the "desktops", KDE and Gnome, are built upon a window
manager interface, so they require an underlying system such as Sawfish.
 Those options you mention are probably for swapping in a different
underlying window manager, and they should only show those installed WMs
that are compatible with KDE.

But you can indeed run a window manager directly, omitting the "desktop
manager" altogether, which has always been my minimalist preference.  It
isn't hard to do, if you can live without all those distracting menubars
and icons and things.  I run Enlightenment, myself, with only an
on-screen-display (OSD) clock and a terminal window showing by default
(and I launch most GUI app's via xbindkeys).  Enlightenment is
lightweight yet full-featured and pretty.

Fluxbox is my second choice.  It's even lighter than E', but it's also a
bit rougher around the edges, figuratively speaking.

Honorable mention goes to WindowMaker, which is very fast and stable.

it didn't take me forever to hook it up.

Thank you folks for your opinions :) I'll try some of them on my

Though a surprising number are.  Anything that understands DCOP should
be able to work with KDE.  Off the top of my head, AfterStep does this.

FWIW, I switched from OpenBox to Enlightenment for a more useful pager
and more eye candy.  I found it was so slow with more than a few windows
open it became nearly unusable.  When you find yourself getting pissed
off at your computer because it won't switch desktops fast enough,
something is wrong.

I switched from E to KDE at that point.  I killed kicker, disabled
artsd, and cleaned it up to act more like a respectable window manager.
It's damned near as fast as Openbox (but uses a lot more RAM, I'm sure)
with a much nicer pager available.  So, it's a stripped-down KDE for me,
E was just too damned slow.

Just my two cents....

No. It's in the global part. I had a look at the man page for lilo.conf, 
and it shows the root line as part of the global section.

Just to see what would happen, though, I removed it from that part of 
the file and inserted it in each of the sections related to the separate 
kernals, ran lilo, and rebooted. It didn't make any difference: the boot 
stopped at the same place in the 2.6 kernel, and finished just fine in 
the 2.2 kernel.

I compiled the 2.6 kernel as follows:

make mrproper
make menuconfig
   (The only things I changed from stock was to add ext3 support, as
    recommended by my earlier mentor, and to remove MCA support, since
    I kept getting an error message when I left it in, and I'm reasonably
    certain that there is no Micro Channel Architecture on this machine!)
make install
make modules_install
lilo
reboot

So, I don't know if that is "the Debian way" or not, but I'm guessing 
that somehow it isn't. What do I add, and where do I add it, to provide 
initrd support? Or, what are the steps to follow to compile the kernel 
"the Debian way?"

Good point.  And for smaller operations, a hosted web-based system could
work nicely, if privacy rules were maintained.

Yow!  And there are lots of other "niche" markets like that.  Heck, at
Collab-Tech, we're getting ready to push out an install of a web-based
care management system for mental health clinics.  That's a market in
itself, but the system seems like it'd be adaptable to other types of
medical care.  Hmm...

That's been my hope for a while--that OSS would allow the little guys to
work these kinds of niches by allaying the risk of abandonware.  If ya
want it maintained, ya just pays someone.

Heck, even the system the app is written needs to be OSS.  Witness the
troubles caused by MS "upgrading" Access and breaking old code.

Indeed.  Sounds like a good thing for some PSAS veterans to work on.
As Linux-based rocketeers, they know GPS and rugged, you betcha.

I've been focussing on Linux applications in the non-profit sphere
lately, but now I'm trying to move beyond that, and more into getting
OSS out into all kinds of endeavors.  I really appreciate the
inspiration, Rich.

Aaron,

  Think Chinese Medicine: accupuncture, herbal treatments, etc. I believe
that it is this bottom-up approach that will help linux become more widely
established in business.pp

  There is an equally powerful argument at the front-end, too. Suppose a
prospective client could arrange to spend $5,000 for a 'starter' system.
Software licenses for a Microsoft-based solution could consume a significant
proportion of that. That leaves you to try to give them quality and support
for less than it's really worth. But, with FOSS, all the budget goes to you.
They get better value for their money and you have more with which to work.
Win-win.

> Heck, even the system the app is written needs to be OSS. Witness the

  Well, they have done the same with Excel macros based on what I've read.
I also heard that Access is either a flat-file dbms or the front end to
other systems. It does work as a front end to the winduhs port of
PostgreSQL.

  You're very welcome.

  Here's another potential avenue: home-based businesses. It's been a number
of years since I saw the statistics, but the last numbers were more than
20,000 home-based businesses _registered_ in Oregon. These are not the meth
labs, either. A former neighbor of mine designed, programmed and installed
conrollers that converted saw mills from large-diameter trees to
small-diameter trees. His wife worked in the garage, wiring and soldering
control panels while he wrote and burned the code onto eproms. Great people.
Another former neighbor built sand-rails (what we used to call dune buggies)
in his garage. Then there are all the day care providers. They need to keep
records of all sorts of stuff to demonstrate they're qualified and haven't
lost any kids lately.

  If you get used to thinking where others fear to tread, I belive there's
almost unlimited potential available.

If you have any questions about Enlightenment, I'd be happy to help answer
them.

I've been using Enlightenment excusively for many years.

Weird.

Were you also running KDE apps under Enlightenment?

I run Enlightenment for years and even used to run the same version I'm
running today on my old P-150 desktop system.

It's snappy and lightweight.

However, I've never run a KDE application and won't install anything that
requires Qt.  The overhead just seems to be way too much.

I figure you can choose one major widget set (and a few minor ones, of
course, like Xaw, which are tiny) and stick with it.  Since I'm not going
to have a system without the Gimp, it's GTK.

I'm sure KDE seems snappier than Enlightenment because KDE is practically
running anyway when you're running just about any KDE application.

KDE itself uses Qt... it's like a library ontop of Qt, almost.

KDE is Qt.  Qt isn't KDE... it isn't actually too slow by itself, IME.

I agree... although I'm not a huge fan of the gimp - I *hate* image
editing.

Nope, I don't run KDE applications except for my occasional love, Kate.
I run Evolution, Gaim, Firefox, gnome-terminal, gkrellm, bmp and the
like, not too much KDE stuff.  I'm not a huge fan of that crap.

Thanks! From there, I found my way to "Reported Working Video Cards":

http://www.xfree86.org/current/i7404.html#4

and I find that the first card on the list, Real3D Starfighter AGP, is 
the one I have! Once I have the other issues resolved, I should be able 
to use the latest version of xfree86.

The easy debian way is make-kpkg, which is part of the debian package
kernel-package . Then, you do

make menuconfig
make-kpkg buildpackage <or>
make-kpkg binary modules

This builds a package in the directory above the source dir, which you
can install with dpkg -i <kernel-image...deb>. This puts an initrd into
place, and makes it more likely to work.

The hard way is to build an initrd using mkinitrd. If you choose to go
that route, you're going to need to be comfortable with manpages, so I
refer you to the mkinitrd manpage.

Did you check to see if initrd support was enabled in the config?  If it
is, then the image that you are trying to load is for the 2.4 kernel,
this will bomb out.  To get this to work, you would need to make an
initrd image for the 2.6 kernel.  If it isn't enabled, then lilo would
be trying to feed an initrd image (for a 2.4 kernel) to a kernel that
doesn't want it, I think this would bomb out too.  To fix this, just
comment out the the initrd line in /etc/lilo.conf (you will need to add
it to the old kernel entry) and then run lilo.  

> make install

I usually do "make bzlilo", which will rotate your current kernel to the
old kernel, install your new kernel and change lilo.conf, then run lilo
for you.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0408200708250.4804-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I have been dealing with a multitude of project the last two weeks and 
they all seem to be coming at once.

This little issue is a lost project -- from two months ago.  I have a
friend's Toshiba laptop.  I turned it on and all worked well and booted
RHL 7.0.  I tried a couple of times looking for oddities and because I got
interrupted.  Then I started an upgrade to Fedora Core 1 and walked away
for a bit as the upgrade appeared to be happening.  I came back and the
system was off.  When I went to turn it on all I got is a blinking battery
light.  I did had brick and friends plugged in so I unplugged it but teh 
results are teh same: The battery light flashes.

I suspect this might be a dead battery issue -- go figure -- but was 
wondering if FC1 might have broke something on the laptop.  It just seems 
odd for it [the battery] to fail during the upgrade.

It is an older Toshiba Satellite.  I'm trying to remember and I'd say 
circa. 1998 probably.

I'm looking for initial suggestions that don't include replacing the
battery since the battery is expensive.  I'll get to that later.  Also is
anyone aware of Toshiba's shop record or know of a national support
company if all else fails?


TIA,
Rod

Rod,

  It's a long commute for you, but Northwest Computer Support in Beaverton
may do mail order service, too. I've had excellent work by them (except the
one time they didn't reseat the Sony's keyboard properly and I had to make
another 50-mile round trip).

  On the 1999-vintage ThinkPad 600E we have, the A/C adapter failed about a
year ago. I would not charge the battery. NCS checked it out, discovered the
reason and sold me a new brick and cord. Just a couple of months ago the
battery wheezed and died. I found a replacement for $65 by searching the
Web.

  Based on my experiences and what you report I'd look at the A/C adapter
first. If the battery was dead it would still run off the mains, unless the
Toshiba is different from my Portege (1999) on which I replaced the battery
last year and the IBM.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0408200801390.20913@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  In my GNU/Emacs book I see that I can specify different formatting styles
for .c files and I can indent code by use of ESC-C-\ (but I'm not sure for
what the 'C' stands; neither Ctrl nor 'c' seem to do anything). But, what I
want to do is change code written by someone else to the spacing I prefer:
2 spaces rather than 8 spaces.

  Is there a way to do this in one fell swoop? I really don't want to spend
the time to bring each line to the left margin then press tab. The file on
which I'm now working is 638 lines long.

Thanks,

The C there is Control.  I believe ESC-C-\ is equivalent to M-C-\, so
hold down the Alt key and the Control key simultaneously and while
doing so, press the \ key.  Or just (I think) do the equivalent, M-x
indent-region.

You can learn how to use the "indent" program ("man indent"), or
perhaps in emacs select the region you are interested in and then M-x
indent-region.

Or 'indent-sexp' (C-M-q) will indent function by function.

What is "that"?  Do you mean "indent" or "M-x indent-region"?

  Both "M-x indent-region" and M-C-\ work just fine. The [Esc] key didn't
work (danged book!) but the [Alt] key does.

  Didn't read the man page.

Sorry for the ambiguity, Russell,

I run Red Hat 9 on a system that has been pretty fast in the past, but

software than I did before but the whole system just drags along these 
days.  It takes minutes just to load Open Office and it didn't used to.  
My screen saver runs in slow motion.  I have an ext3 file system.  Does 
this file system ever need to be defragmented or anything like that?  Is 
there anything else that anyone can think of?  I really haven't added or 
changed anything since the days when it ran fast.

That's right I was going to check this out but I've been having too many 
brain cramps(farts) lately and ideas slip away.  I'll throw it on the

I think the competition with all the Froogle, eBay, pricewatch and like
sites is mading it easier to find stuff at better prices.  When Mike
priced batteries, probably shortly after he bought the laptop, they were
very expensive.

Thanks for helping me get a better perspective.

Some possible avenues of investigation include:

* Is the disk or one of its partitions getting too full?

   df -h

* Is something hogging CPU?

   top -b -n1 | head -n15

* Is something hogging memory or swapping compulsively?

   free -m

   Look for small numbers in the "free" column. If something is indeed
   hogging memory, you can probably identify it by running /usr/bin/top
   and pressing M to sort by memory usage.

* Is some I/O operation stuck?

   iostat -c 2 5

   Look for high numbers in any column but %idle. (iostat is included
   as part of the sysstat rpm, which is often not installed by
   default.)

It doesn't sound disk related (don't think that would effect the screen
saver).

I'd run the top command (or one of the similar gui system monitors) to
see if there's anything using a lot of CPU or memory.

The escape key should always work, as the meta key does not exist on
many keyboards (VT100, etc.).  Did you press and release the escape
key, followed by Ctrl-\ ?  The following sequence should give you
a description of the indent region command.
  C-h k ESC C-\

Subject: [PLUG] shell script question
Message-ID: <1093026304.41264200ecd3f@neon.netpro.to>

I'm writing a short shell script to parse a log file.  I have several strings
that appear in the logs that I don't care about.  I'd like to make this script
more dynamic so that I can add new strings as needed and have them
automatically grep'd out.  I'd like to add these strings to an array and have
the grep line loop through each string.  So, for example, I could do it this
way:

grep -v "some string" mylog | grep -v "some other string" | grep -v "yet another
string"

But I'd rather add each string to an array and dynamically create each "grep -v
$ignore" command.

Any suggestions?
Thanks,
~M

If you just want to use grep, tell it to use extended regular expressions:

  grep -vE 'some string|some other string|yet another string'

That's not nearly as complicated as my suggestion, but I suppose I'll still use

Try fc-cache -f as root.  If that doesn't work, start checking to see if
perhaps your system was compromised.

But does that solve the problem of dynamism?  I was thinking you could
write a loop to build the grep command (or commands, if you opt for
complexity!) as a variable, and then plop that variable onto a new line
of its own, a la:

$LOOP_GENERATED_COMMAND || exit 1

Another option is to write them to a file and use -f (i.e., fgrep).

This is easily the most manageable solution, e.g.

$ cat badstrings.txt
^this stuff
unwanted.*string
[[:space:]][[:space:]]*$

$ grep -v -f badstrings.txt working-file.txt

I assume this means that I should apt-get install kernel-source-2.6.7 
first. I looked back in my notes and found that the kernel source I'm 
using is not Debian's package, but from ftp.kernel.org. So, I ran 
apt-get install kernel-source-2.6.7, and I got the following error message:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Setting up pdl (2.4.0-1) ...

Errors were encountered while processing:
  pdl
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I understand that pdl is an extension of perl, the perl data language. 
Is it used in the kernel compile process? Is this something I need to 
fix before I can proceed?

I looked in lilo.conf, but found no reference to initrd.

As you've probably seen in my response to Jeff, I've discovered that I'm 
not using a Debian kernel package and build process. From the reading 
I've done so far, it looks like if I did use a Debian kernel, initrd 
would be taken care of.

One thing to check: if you're not using an initrd, you need to compile the
filesystem driver for the root filesystem into the kernel image (rather
than as a module).

BTW, is anyone here running Conectiva 10? I installed it without using the
usual installer (I don't have a CD burner or broadband), and although I
was able to create an initrd with mkinitrd, I haven't been able to get the
Conectiva kernel to use it. I'd like to see the /boot/grub/menu.lst from
one that's set up correctly.

I second that! Also check "PC BIOS (MSDOS partition tables) support".
It's in:

File systems  --->
Partition Types  --->

Advanced partition selection
  PC BIOS (MSDOS partition tables) support

This has bitten me a couple times.

So, an alternative to getting initrd working is to re run make 
menuconfig and find the place where the root filesystem is set to be a 
module, and change that? I'll give that a try.

And while I'm checking on the root filesystem, I'll look for this, too.

You also need to make sure the kernel option for initrd is off.  You may
also need to install the mod-utilities for the 2.6 kernel.

Good Luck,

This is a leftover from some other install. You will need to either
remove it or reinstall it.

apt-get remove pdl

see if it tries to take anything important with it.

you'll then need to do 

apt-get install kernel-source-<whatever> kernel-package

Likely completely unrelated. At some point either you told the system to
install pdl or something depending on pdl and so it got installed. As
kernel-package doesn't use pdl, though the above isn't good it won't
cause problems.

Not using the Debian kernel source packages isn't a problem. Simply
running `make-kpkg kernel_image` in an unpacked kernel directory will go
through all the needed steps and produce a kernel package in the parent
directory. It doesn't matter whether the kernel source was from a Debian
kernel source package or vanilla source. You might want to look at the
man page for `make-kpkg` and possibly create a ~/.kernel-pkg.conf file.

I have installed SuSE 9.1 on a friend's system with basically no problems
but I'm running into some issues with dialup (out).  I need to see what is
happening message-wise.  Is there a debug setting I've missed or are the
messages going somewhere I can't seem to discover?
                                                                                
Modem dials, negociates a connection and then after a few moments (30+
seconds to 2 minutes) dials again.  In the mean time I can't seem to get a
route to the net.  I need to see the messages to and from the modem.  An
alternative is to do a connection manually to see want is going on --
modem is really working correctly etc. but I don't find minicom or a
similar type of telecom program.  Is there one?

The machine this installed on is slow!  AMD K6/2 500 with 128M RAM and an
IDE HD.  So searching or starting programs takes a _really_ long time.
I'm hoping to short circuit my work a bit with your knowledge.  Searches 
using Google turn up pretty old stuff and so far nothing useful.


TIA,

Colin,

  In addition to the two excellent options above, consider pulling the drive
and temporarily attaching it to a linux box. Then you can work from there
with hdparm or other tools and see what's gone on.

I'm about to be without a network connection for about 2 weeks.

I ordered DSL through DSL-Only and it was supposed to be installed 
tomorrow. I got an email from DSL-Only today telling me that Verizon has 
canceled the order because my voice line is on a digital loop. Digital 
loop == no DSL...

SOOOO... I called Speakeasy, knowing they will run another pair to get 
the DSL up. Installation time is 14 days. That makes this installation 
supposed to be live on 9/6. At the very longest, my present connection 
will be up until 8/31. At that time, I'm looking at 6 or 7 days of 
downtime.

Does someone know where I could park my domain for this short timespan?

I'd like to redirect my domain there and have email available for the 5 
people that get their primary email from my domain.

Any other suggestions are welcome as well.

Message-ID: <BAY9-F4BfqP1XgEBRjJ0006c213@hotmail.com>


Hi:

I got a bunch of CDs with large datafiles on them.  Each CD contains about
4 or 5 files (each file is about 140MB to 160MB or so).  When I am trying to 
copy (cp) them onto my hard drive
(I am running Redhat 9), I would often receive
an error saying that "I/O Error reading xyz file".
The same CD, would have
no problem under MS Windows.
I can drag the same set of files onto my harddrive under windows.
So I think the CD itself is not corrupted.

Any tricks in reading large files from
a CD under Linux?

Thanks

You could try rsync.

rsync -Pav source destination

I'm sure someone here can supply some tar incantations also.

Huh?  Ripping CDs generally doesn't involve the sound card, full-duplex
or not.  Not that I've seen a half-duplex sound card...

Ovid, have you tried fooling around with the volume control (xalsamixer,
whatever) after a rip?  That's a dang weird problem.

Try Redwood Virtual.  I rent a virtual Linux box from 'em for $5/mo
(starts at $10/mo now) and have few compaints.  It's really nice to have
my stuff hosted where I don't have to worry about IP addresses, moves or
ISP changes.  Heck, these days, I don't even pay for an ISP and use
Personal Telco instead.

Huh.  Same box, same drive?  Some CD drives are more sensitive,
malajusted or dirty than others.

If it is the same box, try doing an 'hdparm -d0 /dev/cdrom' and see if
it works better.  If so, DMA's broken with that drive, and the Linux IDE
maintainer might be interested in what drive and controller you have.

Good luck,

I second the RWV recommendation.  I've been with 'em since before they
were RWV and haven't had any problems aside from a few unscheduled
downtimes (most recently for something like 12 hours - that was a major
bummer, but oh well...) and sometimes the box feels a little bit laggy.

I started out with the (now defunct) $5/month deal but recently upgraded
when I began playing with MySQL and PHP and found I was eating up many
gigabytes of bandwidth every month.

They've done good by this customer - I've sent about five folks over
there, four are still with 'em.

Aaron- you should mention you get a referral bonus, a free month, for
everybody you get who stays with the service for six months.  If they
don't list you, you don't get anything.

Since switching to DHCP, on Red Hat 8.0, all of my Windows 98 clients have the same problem when trying to log onto the network. They get an error message stating that no domain server was available. After clicking cancel and then doing an ipconfig /all, they are not receiving an ip address from the server. I then have to do a ipconfig /renew_all and then have them log off and then back in again.
The error message I am recieiving in the samba log file is:
[2004/08/16 18:15:56, 0] lib/util_sock.c:read_data(436)  
  read_data: read failure for 4. Error = No route to host


I don't understand why it is only happening on the Windows 98 clients and I am not sure how to fix the problem.

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,
Mary

Verify the netmask; I've seen some versions of 95/98 that disregarded
the netmask given by DHCP, which broke the SMB broadcasting.

Try using "readcd" to read the entire CD to an ISO file, then mount the
ISO via loopback and see if the files are now readable.  Sometimes it's
easier to read the whole CD at once than to read a file at a time,
particularly if the CD drive is marginal or if the CD were initially
mastered oddly.

OK. I've installed mountloop, but there is *no* documentation. The only
thing I get is:

usage: mountloop <enc> <file> <dir> [<fs type>]

So I have some ISOs that I want to mount as read only. So, perhaps the
syntax is something like:

mountloop ??? /var/iso/cd1.iso /mnt/cd1

I assume that <enc> is encoding, but what *kind* of encoding? And can I
put some variant of this into /etc/fstab so these files are always
available?

You don't need mountloop to mount loopback filesystems.

mount -o loop /var/iso/cd1.iso /mnt/cd1

should work fine unless you are missing modules. You'll want to load
the loop driver with

modprobe loop

If it's an encrypted loop iso you may need other drivers.

I'm not sure what 'mountloop' does; I don't have it.

Randall,

We (my employer) has used them for a number of years, through their 
re-incarnation (or so I'm told - I've only been with the company six 
months).  We're in the same building and I have found their service to 
be professional and their staff responsive.  Before sending this, I 
checked with a co-worker who has been here longer and has much more 
experience with them.  He is also satisfied with them.

Model name/number helps.  http://www.andale.com is a nice way to price

You can also search completed listings on eBay...

Looks like anywhere from $810 to $1600, depending on config.

  After they decided to get into Microsoft's bed, I'd say about $3.95.

  eBay has one for $1,600. They also have two with 8 cpus; one for $152.50
the other for $405. Guess they're cheaper with more processors. Actually,
eBay has 18 for sale with various numbers of processors and amounts of RAM.

I've had E4500s (Solaris, not Linux) at my last two jobs; they're 
lovely machines, although those older UltraSPARC IIs aren't anywhere 
near the fastest CPUs on the planet. My hunch is that a dual-Xeon or 
perhaps even a dual-1GHz-PIII machine will outperform it for most 
tasks -- and you'll spend a lot less in electricity. :-)

I'm running Gentoo on an uniprocessor UltraSPARC II at home, and have 
nothing but good things to say. (I'd love to have /etc/make.conf 
include the line CFLAGS="-j8 -mcpu=ultrasparc -O3 -pipe". :-)

Have any of y'all tried the Axim X30?  If so, how'd you like it?

I'm looking at potentially purchasing the one with integrated 802.11b.
I would probably keep Windows Mobile Edition on it (haven't decided for
sure just yet), but would certainly be needing to sync it (contacts,
calendar, tasks) with Evolution.  I want to figure out something to put
email on it, off my IMAP server, as well... but haven't quite looked
into that just yet.

Any opinions on the thing?  Recommendations for similarly priced PDAs
offering as much punch for the buck?

Thanks.  :-)

Can't speak from personal experience, but my boss is happy with his. He

Subject: [PLUG] typical power draw for a headless, diskless PC?
Message-ID: <86oekzg2ct.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

There is a lot of 52 last generation PC's (Pentium II and IIIs, mostly
400 MHz Pentium IIs), many of which are dual proc boxes, for sale on
EBay.  I am considering buying them to run as a 30.7 GHz compute farm
in my basement for a few months.  As part of the consideration, I need
to think about powering them.  They are headless, and I'd probably
pull the hard disks and netboot them.  How much power should I expect
one of these boxes to draw?  Keith Lofstrom?  Anybody?

If I can pull this off, I think we'd probably decommission after a few
months and give the boxes to Free Geek.

Secondly, does anyone have an empty van making a round trip to the Bay
Area in the next few weeks?

Paint me prejudiced, but I would buy nothing from Dell unless I
wanted something unwarrantied and disposable.  Their service and
support sucks.

On the other hand, PDAs are evolving so fast, perhaps they ARE
disposable.

Subject: [PLUG] skipping spamd for unknown users
Message-ID: <20040825190311.GA14892@patch.com>

Rather than reject mail for unknown users I redirect it to local user dumpme.
dumpme has a simple .procmailrc:

  :0:
  /dev/null

My system procmailrc, however, invokes spamc to check the mail for spamminess.

I'd like to skip this for mail destined to dumpme.

Seemingly obvious solutions:

  Have postfix dump the mail to /de/null

Doesn't seem to work becuase the options are a) reject the mail, b) forward to luser_relay (an address)

  Have system wide procmailrc look for mail destined to dumpme and dump.

Since the dumpme destination isn't written to the header AFAICT procmail can't test for this.  (true??)

  Something I haven't thought of.

Probable solution, that's why I'm writing to all of you.

OK, I have the network part down. I have a patch panel installed and

I'd also like to patch the telephone through my rack. It's POTS, so just 
a single pair. What I'm having difficulty finding is something that I

I thought of a 66 block, but that's for 25 pair.

The typical expensive wasteful way to do this is to run 2 or more Cat5 jacks
everywhere, and use one of the jacks as a phone jack.  I'm sure you
could rig some sort of mutant cable to run the same one line to each
"phone" jack.  Then you can repurpose the phone jacks for 'net or
whatever when you score a bunch of IP phones on eBay.

Also, ethernet only uses two pairs of a four-pair line.  You could make
a clever splitter at the rack and the jack that breaks out one of the
unused pairs as an RJ11 jack.  (Just make sure it's not a pair used
for Power Over Ethernet.)

  The ol'POTS lines are pretty forgiving.  The low tech option is to just
wire the Tip/Ring conductors together in parallel.  Using a "66 Connecting
Block with RJ45 Jacks" would allow you to patch over from a panel.  A number
of single RJ-45 jacks, daisy-chain wired together, may be a cheaper option.


Something like this:
66 Connecting Block
http://www.smarthome.com/8610.html

  A higher tech solution would be to get a telephone line sharing to allow
multiple lines to contend for one or more trunk lines.  I haven't installed
one for years.  Google for "telephone line sharing" to find a manufacturer.


  Of course, since you asked on the PLUG list.  It might just be easier to
install an Asterisk Linux PBX.

Have you looked at the selection of Leviton stuff at Home Depot? They 
have 66 blocks, and things that are similar. I helped a friend wire his 
house for phone and ether net. He ran CAT-3 for telephone, and we 
terminated the data closet end on one of these Leviton boards. It's 
designed to be installed as a module in a larger box, but I was able to 
mount it on a piece of hardboard and fit that into a standard four-gang 
(I think) electrical box. It comes with its own punch down tool, the 
same one that they use for their CAT-5 jacks. Worked quite well. We put 
the phone company feed on the top row, and used the remaining 9 or 11 
(can't remember if it had 10 or 12 rows) for the rooms in the house. If 
necessary, one could jumper one board to another to increase the capacity.

Given that I've yet to see a 100Mb link happen on a cable with anything
less than eight wires, I'd say they're all being used.

Here's what the Cisco CCNP BCMSN book says about it:

Because UTP Ethernet connections use only pairs 1,2 and 3,6, some cable
plant installers connect only these pairs and leave the remaining two
positions empty. Although this move provides Ethernet connectivity, it
is not good practise for future needs.<snip> Also, to be compatible with
the new IEEE 802.3ab standard for Gigabit Ethernet over copper
(1000BASE-T), all four pairs must be used end-to-end.

So, yes and no.

"just have to assume?"  You can assume many other scenarios:
  I've fallen, Lassie got lost, need help
  Won the lottery and blew out of town
  Bicycling is life, all else is a distraction
  My email system is so buried in spam that I didn't get your message
  The last batch of beer was really, really good and I'm still having fun

or you *can* assume that I hate you or you're one of the two people on 
my blackhole list.

   in other words
Yep.  If that's the way your assumtions run.  I'm a bastard. :)

Even for the small collection of domains that I manage the dumpme
address was averaging over 30,000 emails a day.  I suppose it would be
reasonable to upgrade my dns/web/mail/database/time/whatever server
from the 300mhz box it's running on.  FWIW I'm processing ~40,000 messages
daily including the dumpme stuff.  Which is to say 10,000 of actual mail
in one form or another.  The counts are for the last three months and come
from pflogsumm.

No, so "no and no" 100mbs does not use all four pair.

Good wiring practices and Gigabit ether do use all pairs but not 100MB.

Well, my experience with Dell hasn't been quite so horrible.  The one
time something did go wrong with my (now two-year-old) laptop they fixed
it rather quickly and painlessly.  Oh, there was also a voluntary recall
of my laptop's motherboard - they sent a dude out who swapped boards on
my dining-room table.

And, also, IME PDAs don't die very frequently.  There aren't a lot of
moving parts in 'em to break.

I was hoping for stories like "Yeah, it worked great for me, the battery
life was a bit short, but it works with Synce when I'm in a WinCE mood
and Opie when I was in a Linux mood" - the technical rather than
support-related.  :-)

(btw, thanks Aaron for the anecdotal evidence they're decent PDAs)

I would have to disagree here.  My five-year-old PDA still works fine...
it is just getting a bit bulky and is rather feature-lacking.  I did
actually see the same thing for sale the other day.  They're Palm
IIIxe's.

Of course, I'm not sure how backwards-compatible most WinCE software is.
Then again... with 64MB of ROM and 64MB of RAM, it should be able to run
Linux basically forever.

I think the old 100VG-AnyLAN required 4 pairs of Cat 3 or better, but
standard 100Mb ethernet only uses 2 pair of Cat 5.

So... Now that you've torn apart my rhetorical question phrased in a
colloquialism, I'll ask directly: Why not just do the Right Thing and
reject invalid recipients at SMTP-time?  Why even accept messages that
won't be delivered at all?

You'd save yourself 30,000 procmail forks per day if you just didn't
accept the message at all, which means could probably handle another
10,000 or more real messages.

Message-ID: <20040826032805.18820.qmail@web50602.mail.yahoo.com>

I use a FireWire drive for backup. I was thinking
about turning out an occasional DVD for this purpose,
however, since I've never heard of a DVD crashing.
Such a DVD would be like those produced for Mandrake
and Fedora, which I think is .udf. (By now you realize
that I haven't done it yet.)

Anyhow, will k3b do this? I have used it to make CD's
and I like it. There are of course commercial Windows
applications for making data DVD's, but they are just that--commercial.

K3b is an easy way to do this.  However, be certain to try to read the DVD
after you've written it-- this means to run md5sum over all the files and
check that they match the originals.

I just finished a project to run backups to DVD and was horrified at the
silent failures during writes that only cropped up when I made sure
everything was present.

Subject: [PLUG] SIGURG
Message-ID: <86oekycxbl.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I am trying to implement a heartbeat handler in my slave program.  The
idea is that the master can "ping" the slave with an out-of-band
packet, which the slave echos from the signal handler.  This lets the
master program know that the slave is still alive and reachable.
However, it isn't working.  I have a handler that looks like:

void
heartbeat_handler(int signum)
{
  if(verbose)
    psignal(signum,"thump");

  int n;
  char c;

  if((n = recv(skt,&c,1,MSG_OOB)) < 0)
    if(errno != EWOULDBLOCK)
      printf("where's the thump?\n");
  send(skt,&c,1,MSG_OOB);
  return;
}

and then the signal handler is installed in main() as:
  
signal(SIGURG, heartbeat_handler);

The master sends a single-byte ping with MSG_OOB.  Ethereal shows the
packet with the URG flag, but the heartbeat_handler never gets
called.  Stracing the slave doesn't show anything that looks like a
SIGURG signal.  Near as I can tell, this is supposed to work.  Any
clues to what I'm doing wrong?  This is on a 2.4.25 kernel.

Nevermind.  I found it.  I needed the call:

   fcntl(sock,F_SETOWN,getpid());

in order to set ownership of the signals to the current pid.  That
worked on the slave, the URG packet is now echo'd.  I just need to get
the master side to hear it now! ;-)

I have made a couple dozen DVDs on a windows machine with a verify pass

This is spam related.  My MX secondary, for as yet unknown reasons, has
a lot of my domains' mail sent through it.  The seconday has no way to 
verify user validity. When a spammer would dump mail on the secondary
the secondary would attempt delivery.  I'd bounce it back and then the 
seocndary would attempt to return the reject to the sender.  The sender
in this case often being invalid, spoofed, hijacked or whatever.  The 
reject mails would build up clogging the secondary's system.

The reason is given in the question. Spammers know that many people 
don't filter on secondaries, and try them first.

IMHO; secondaries should have the same (exact same) filtering as a 
primary MX.

How do you propose that a secondary know what the contents of the
valid user list?  That's a thorny problem.

Yes, but here's the catch.

Primary:

MTA accepts mail and hands off to procmail which hands off to spamassassin.

Secondary:

MTA accepts mail and attempts delivery to primary.

The secondary never hands it off to procmail, so it never gets checked 
for spammyness by the delivery agent.

Since usernames can't usually be checked by secondaries, they are good 
targets for spammers to get messages in the queue.

You don't have to know Perl, but you do have to have solid skills in another programming language
(preferablly OO.)  If you do, send your resume!

Most spammers now deliver *only* to the secondaries, for exactly
the reasons you state.

Back when the internet was sketchy, MXes made sense.  These days, MXs
should be included only if you expect your machine to be offline for 4
or more hours on a regular basis, or are behind a firewall.

Get rid of your MX, and life will be much better.  If your machine is
down for an hour or two, the sender will redeliver later.  And a
spammer will just move along.

  It doesn't look like FC2 installs "wish" as a standard package.  There are
a bunch of TCL libs, but I don't see "wish" on my machine.  

Try calling it from the TCL shell: "tclsh cyraddusers.tcl"

You may have to install the real TCL/TK to use that script.

  Oh. As I recall, wish is the tcl shell.

You have a reference that documents the spammer behavior?  We've speculated
that this is the case, but don't have "proof."

For better or worse I am hosted on consumer grade DSL and like to leave
town for vacations.  If the DSL modem gets hung (as it is wont to do) 
while I was out of town the mail lists I host would be hosed.

Well, if you want hands-on Perl training, Stonehenge partners with the
Center for Professional Development at OGI/OHSU to present frequent
open-enrollment trainings in beginning and intermediate Perl.  See
http://cpd.ogi.edu for details.

FC2 does not install 'wish' as a standard package and they moved it
from one package to another.  I forget the new package but it is on
the 4th CD I think.  You can find the list on the website and then do
a search on the page for the TCL pacakges and it will say which one
contains the wish binary.  Then you can use the CD to install that RPM
package.  I had to do that for my FC2 install.  I selected a 'server'
install then I explicitly went through all the options and added them.
 I think if you choose 'Everything' as an install option you would
have had it installed.  I even told it to install Tk/TCL I think.

Ah, the secondary makes sense, although (I think) you can accept
everything from the MX and reject unknown users from everywhere else.  I
shut down my secondary a few weeks ago to make greylisting more
effective and haven't really missed it.  I guess when I shut my box down
this weekend to upgrade I'll probably turn it back on.  I'll probably
re-enable it after I've upgraded it too.

As far as the secondary knowing the valid users, it's a solvable
problem, I think.  I'd probably have to put more thought into it than I
have available right now.

Well, I think statistically it appears to be the case.  There have
probably been studies done; no doubt someone on the SA list would
know...

Maybe you need a new DSL provider?  I haven't had a single outage in +3
years due to DSL.  (Usually it's due to a power flicker and the stupid
Compaq Deskpro I have for power not having a keyboard plugged-in...)

  I'm glad to read that I'm not the only one who suffers thought
insuffiencies now and then. I always seem to run out of them when I am up
against a deadline and need more thoughts than I have on hand.

Let me skip on-ahead of you and tell you the TCL scripts from the
"Managing IMAP" book don't work with modern versions of Cyrus (2.0 and
later, I think).  If you're trying to migrate from mbox to Cyrus, either
try imaputil from UW ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/ or try out the
quick and dirty scripts I wrote to fill in the gaps:

Actually, it's the Tk (WIndowing SHell) and is in the tk package.

It largely depends on the type and configuration of the MTA running on 
the secondary MX.

Sendmail and Postfix both have the capability to know which users at a 
relay domain are valid, but local configuration determines how it gets 
implemented.

Yes.  migrate-pw-to-cyrus2.pl creates INBOXES for users. createfolders.
pl creates sub-folders.  batchsubscribe.pl subscribes users to their
mailboxes.  These scripts were written for a 2.0 migration I did.  If
you're using something other than flat files for subscription, you'll
need to use the database conversion utility to convert them.  Also, a
lot of paths are assumed, so if you're using directory hashing (or full
dir hashing) you might have to make adjustments.  I hope you know a
little Perl :) I've only used these scripts once and wrote them in less
than an hour when I discovered I wasn't going to be able to use the Tcl
scripts, so YMMV.

You might find the mailutil a little easier, although I've never used
it, so I can't say.

Unfortunately, the book is way out of date, although the steps for
migration are correct.

UDF can be nice 'cos it's designed to allow you to treat a CD or DVD as
a regular read-write medium.  But UDF support in Linux is kinda new.
For backups, it's OK (and IIRC common) to use ISO9660 on a DVD.

Or you could just use raw tar format.

This is what I've done for my DVD+R backups-- straight ISO9660.  Be warned
that mkisofs will ignore any files over 2GB when building the filesystem,
though.

> Or you could just use raw tar format.

Just don't use multi-part archives that don't fall on the 2048-byte DVD
block size boundaries.  The session will be zero-padded up to the next
block which will confuse the restore since it relies on the EOF from the
read to determine where the end of the multi-part archive is.

An alternative is to build multi-part archives that are 1/3 the size of a
DVD (so they're under 2GB and also won't waste DVD space) and then create
an ISO filesystem containing these files.  This is what I ended up doing
for my dump-based DVD backups.

As I mentioned before, be sure to ALWAYS do read checks on your media
after it's written.  That should catch these sorts of annoyances.  :-)

Steve, you willing to share your scripts?  I'd like to see how someone 
else would do it.  I know I have my set of hammers.  Be interesting to see 
what other tools are available from the shed.

I cannot publicly talk about the secret spam-fighting cabal of which I
am a member. :)

But yes, this is a well-known behavior of the most recent heavy spam
delivering software, so much so that some people have set up "fake"
secondary MXs to act as spam diverters.

The only scary part is ensuring that you will NEVER EVER deliver real
mail there.  One guy's solution is that the route to his fake MX is
*through* his real box, so there's no way legit guys couldn't have
tried the good one first and not gotten it.  Another easy one is to
have multi-addresses on one interface, and then have the real MTA
listen on one, and the fake listen on another.

Gladly!  It's attached and is a direct descendant of the script I posted
here before:

http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2003-November/025838.html

Some of its features:
  + GPL licensing
  + uses LVM snapshots to ensure consistent backup
  + backs up to a convenient 3-files-per-DVD size
  + supports incremental backups
  + heavily commented

Some of its problems:
  + dump 0.4b37 recommended if using dump files > 2GB
  + smallest unit backed up is a whole filesystem
  + does not auto-detect what to back up
  + requires configuration changes inside the script before use

# The simplest way to restore a file is to use 
# "restore -t -A <archive file>" to list the contents of the dump and

FWIW-You don't need mountloop unless you're doing crypto
loopbacks. All the tools you need you have already (well, assuming
your kernel is built right):

mount -o loop /home/foo/bar.iso /mnt/tmp
cd /mnt/tmp

Likewise. I used my PalmPilot Pro until just a few years ago when I
replaced it with a Palm Vx, which is sexy and small. And I really do
use it every single day.

Oh, and my experience with Dell was that the one time I had a problem
with an onboard VGA card, they cross-shipped a replacement that
arrived the next day. Also, my ancient-ancient 486 is actually still
in their service database.

Are spammers really going to suffer because you're reducing your 
reliability?  Somehow, I doubt it.

I consider this behavior a gift.  If you're using decent bayesian 
filtering, it won't take long before you develop a strong (but flexible) 
distaste for messages relayed through your secondary. Problem solved.

I'm *delighted* spammers are willing to do the difficult work of helping 
me identify bogus messages.  You really want to change that?

Instead of getting rid of your secondary MX, it might make more sense to 
think about getting rid of spam assassin.  I've had vastly better (more 
accurate, less costly) results with CRM114.

YMMV, of course.

Long ago and far away but I do seem to remember this. It has now become
important.  I have client/friend that would like a quick backup/restore
method for, actually, a very small amount of data.  They have a tape drive
and we'll be moving it to the server soon (don't ask and I won't tell --
it is a twisted story).
    I'll probably vary this a bit to meet their needs of slipping a CD/DVD
into a workstation drive and copying over the bogus files.


Thanks,
Rod

Unfortunately, you're the exception, not the rule.  :-(

I would say I have at least an hour's worth of downtime every month.
I've had twelve-hour+ downtimes at least a dozen times in the last two
years.

Yeah, I need a new ISP... unfortunately, my options are St. Paul DSL,
dialup or satellite.

I was with Qwest to begin with - one of the first two dozen installs in
Portland.  Now I'm with SpeakEasy.net  The only complaints I have about
SpeakEasy are:

  * if the phone service drops the DSL modem doesn't reconnect 
  * the DSL modem is a black box with no access for management

Other than that they're great, especially their "we encourage Wifi 
sharing" attitude toward customers.  They provide connectivity and
bandwidth, I make use of it.

Message-ID: <20040827032031.6093.qmail@web50602.mail.yahoo.com>

Until recently, a Dutch Web site provided hacks to get
Philips Webcams, notably the Quickcam 3000 and 4000,
to work with Linux. This included software and
documentation. The author just shut it down--not in
the sense of no longer supporting it, but by totally
removing this material.

(The real problem is a so-called "decompressor"
module. Some distros offer one of the needed modules,
with low resolution and frame rates. But the one that
puts it on steroids is closed-source, and many
applications won't work without it.)

I suppose those wishing to use a Web cam with Linux
will now need to use a different Web cam, or try to
find what they need some other way, which may not be
possible. What are some Web cams that work well with Linux?

I'm another exception then.  I've had DSL since it was first offered
in Portland, and although I remember some outages in the early days, I
haven't had a single outage (that I am aware of[1]) for the last couple
years or so.  At least long enough ago that I can't remember it with
any specificity.

[1] it is possible there have been outages overnight[2], but if so
    they've recovered on their own, no need for power cycling.

[2] for loose definitions of "overnight" having to do with my
    sleepage, rather than relative lightness or darkness.

I've had Nagios monitoring my connection from outside for a while, and I
rarely get notifications.  I can recall a few notifications I couldn't
explain, but I was using the connection at the time and knew it was
okay.

Speaking of DSL, I'm going to be buying my first house and availability
of DSL is a requirement for me.  Does anyone know of a map of local COs?
I'm really only looking in town, so Qwest is all I need.  Qwest used to
have a database, but I don't know if I could find it anymore.  Hm, maybe
I need to spend some time at dslreports...

Those kernel maintainers need a clue bat. But maybe I should read their

I have his next-to-latest release of PWC and PWCX lying around

When I was looking for DSL I had my line checked.  They said I was close enough
to the CO.  So I had a second line put in because I was starting a
business.  It was too far away to get DSL.  Had to put it on my original
line.  So even if you are close enough, you may still be too far away. 
Buy the house you like.  DSL may become unnecessary when 802x comes into
play.

The trouble is, during installation this computer was
assigned the hostname "dhcppc3," and it should
probably be there somewhere. Would someone like to
conjecture where? A number of distros screw things up
like this when you have a dhcp connection, so it may
have happened to you.

I recall a map, but haven't looked recently for obvious reasons.  I
personally know of two COs.  There is the old "Atlantic" switch which
is located about 1000-feet from my house, at NE 24th & Stanton.  The
other is Belmont, at ~SE 17th & Belmont.

(I think) It should be:

127.0.0.1       dhcppc3 localhost 

But why do you want such a horrible name?

Right.  Perhaps you should not live so far from civilization.  I promise
you'd use a heck of a lot less energy if you moved closer to the rest of
society.  Your great-grandchildren will thank you.

IIRC, /etc/hosts file is for fixed IP addresses. Look at /etc/HOSTNAME. 
A hostname like that looks like a Dell machine.

Is apt-get update something that needs to be run frequently? Back a few 
weeks ago, when I started this project, I ran apt-get update, so I 
thought that was recent enough. Is getting the error message I got how 
you know when it's time to update?

dslreports.com (broadbandreports.com) was one of my main resources when 
finding the house I just bought.

After finding out the address, you can find out if there's a listed 
phone number at http://www.reversephonedirectory.com/

With that information, you can test the existing line and find the CO on 
dslreports.com. After doing a few of these tests, you can make an 
educated guess on the ones that are empty or have no listed phone 
number. I also had pretty good luck asking for the existing owners phone 
number to test for DSL.

Nothing is a guarantee. In my case, I'm ~5000 feet from the CO. I was 
thinking this was fantastic. I called DSL-Only and told them to move my 
service. They took the order and started working on it.

When they ordered the circuit from Verizon, they were told that my voice 
line was on a digital circuit, and so, I couldn't get DSL on it.

My choices were to go cable, futz with having another line installed and 
hope it's not multiplexed, or try speakeasy. I don't believe I can hook 
up via wireless where I am (SW 139th and SW Farmington in Beaverton).

I had DishNetwork installed instead of cable, so I'm trying not to jump 
back on the Comcast bandwagon...

I didn't want to go through the expense of having a phone line installed 
for the possibility of running into the same brick wall.

So, I'm waiting for speakeasy/covad to get me a line. They've ordered 
the dry line from Verizon and we'll see how they work out.

You need to `apt-get update` to let your Debian box know which packages
are currently available to it (and what version of those packages are
available). If you don't do this often enough, you may end up installing
a package that's not the most recent, or even trying to install a
package that's no longer available (which appears to be the problem
you're having).

You could probably run `apt-get update` every day and always find that
changes have been made to your favorite repository, but there's really
no reason unless you're planning on freshening up your system, or
intalling some new packages. It's a relatively painless procedure,
anyhow, at least over a decent (e.g., not dial-up) connection.

So, if I haven't gotten anything with apt-get for even a few days, it 
sounds like it's a good idea to update first.

Thanks.

I run 'testing' on my Debian host, so package updates are a way of 
life for me :-). I've got a script /etc/cron.daily/aptmaint that runs 
every morning. It updates the package index files and then reports on 
what packages need upgrading.

#!/bin/sh
#
# nightly cronjob to update package lists and provide a report on 
# which packages need updating
#
AG='/usr/bin/apt-get'

if test ! -x "$AG"; then
   echo "Can't find executable $AG" > /dev/stderr
   exit 1
fi

$AG update >/dev/null 2>&1 && sync && $AG -s upgrade && exit 0

# if we get this far, something's amiss
echo "apt-get operation failed ... somewhere" > /dev/stderr
exit 1

Yeah, but their coverage of Multnomah County is lousy.

It depends on which branch you're using ("unstable" changes a lot more
often than "stable," IIRC), but for the most part, you may as well just
run `'apt-get update` as the first step of any Debian package
maintenance procedure.

Ok, make menuconfig it is, then. That seems to have worked fine.

Next, however, is the part that is probably the cause of my problem. The
instructions say:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase TWO: Create a portable kernel image .deb file
   make-kpkg clean
   make-kpkg --revision=custom.1.0 kernel_image Note: if you have
instructed your boot loader to expect initrd kernels (which is the norm
for recent official kernel image packages) you need to add --initrd to
the line above, and make sure that you have applied the cramfs initrd
patch to the kernel sources (or modified mkinitrd config not create a
cramfs initrd). The cramfs initrd patch is shipped with Debian kernel
sources.
   make-kpkg --initrd --revision=custom.1.0 kernel_image
Personally, I prefer non initrd images for my personal machines, since
then adding third party moduoles to the machine has fewer gotchas
----------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I either have to learn how to apply a patch to the kernel, or how to
instruct my bootloader not to use initrd. Perhaps if I did the latter,
the already compiled 2.6.7 kernel would work. Is that something that
goes in the lilo.conf file? The man page for initrd mentions an option,
noinitrd. For other options it says where to put the option in 
lilo.conf, so I guessed that I could put "noinitrd" in there, too. If 
that's where it goes, it must be along with something else, because when 
I tried it, and ran lilo, the error message complained about an invalid 
token.

Where do I instruct the bootloader not to use initrd?

Cron-apt automates the process, doing it in the daily cron jobs.  You
can also set up cron-apt to fetch the packages as well.  When you do
get around to freshening your install a bit, most, if not all, the
heavy lifting is already done.

Your bootloader assumes no initrd unless you tell it to use an initrd.

However, init assumes that it has everything available to boot the
system, so if critical infrastructure is built as modules, you cannot
boot the system without an initrd.

So you'll have to check that the following things (off the top of my
head -- there may be more) are compiled into the kernel and not
modules.

ide support, if you're using an ide hard drive
your filesystem support (ext2, ext3, reiser, whatever)
your partition style support (dos partitions usually)

frequently filesystems and partitions are compiled as modules and put
into the initrd.

If you have a choice, use CD-R media instead of DVD.  I've had much lower
read error rates with them.

Also, the script I gave is not specific to DVD other than the -B parameter
it feeds to the dump command.  It backs up locally to /backups/levelX,
leaving the choice of copying out to DVD up to you.

Here's how to do that:

growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/dvd -R -J -udf file1 file2 file3

The "-dvd-compat" writes a long lead-out to ensure maximum compatibility
with DVD-ROM drives.  Some of them might choke if the disk is only
half-burned since they sometimes do a power calibration at around the 2GB
mark.

-r: Generate "rationalized" rock ridge extensions.  If you have specific
owner/permission needs then use -R instead.

-J: Generate Windows Joliet extensions

-udf: Don't make an ISO9660 filesystem, make a UDF filesystem

Unlike the DVD-patched cdrecord, there are no speed or burnfree options on
growisofs, however it works with both DVD-R/-RW and DVD+R/+RW media.
(cdrecord only works with DVD-R/-RW)

You can also use K3b, but all it does is call growisofs.  ;-)

To back up to CD instead, change the -B parameter to 665600.

I'm playing with Hercules, and S/390 emulator that allows one to run the 
S/390 mainframe version of linux on a PC.

Has anyone else played with this?

Has anyone found good documentation or a how-to on this?

I'm getting stuck when it comes to setting up devices. I actually have 
had this boot an install image, but it's asking questions that I don't 
know where to find the answers.

I've don't some searches for how-tos, but haven't found much that's 
helpful. I found a redbook that IBM put out. They removed the chapter 
that discussed hercules. I found a copy with the missing chapter, but it 
is talking about hercules version 1, and they're up to version 3. 
Version 1 of hercules didn't support networking... Version 3 is supposed 
to.

The one I have in my haot litttle hand uses a rtl8150 module which I 
found even with an older version of the kernel.

Do I need to do any special magic to make it work?  Plug-n-pray or should
I plug and then boot the system, since it is a basically onetime use?

Did those, and a few other things. I still get a kernel panic message 
when I try to boot the new OS. Fortunately, the old one is still there, 
althoug this time, it is known as Old Linux (or words to that effect). I 
now have three options: Linux, Old Linux, and Linux (with 2.6.7 
somewhere in the name -- sorry, I didn't think to write these down from 
the lilo menu.)

It is said that the only failed experiment is one in which nothing is 
learned. I've learned a few things during this project, so I can't call 
it a total failure, but I'm not getting any closer to having my CD 
burner running, which is what started all this (ATAPI support being part 
of the 2.6 kernel, my HP SureStore 7200i wouldn't need the SCSI 
emulation it needs in earlier kernels).

I see a few options:

1. Wait for a PLUG clinic and have someone take a look and say, "Oh, you 
just need to..." I won't be able to get to a Plug Clinic until October, 
though.

2. Go back to trying to figure out how to set up the CD burner to run 
with Woody.

3. Get a CD set of a 2.6 kernel (I'd do this myself, but as can be 
deduced from the above, I don't have a working CD burner!) and do a 
clean install (there's nothing significant on this machine, yet, so I 
don't mind just wiping the drive and starting over).

4. Figure out why a network install of Sarge didn't work. (I tried this 
a few weeks ago, but I don't remember just what failed, only that it got 
into a circular loop in one of the steps. I think I took notes, so I 
could probably provide those details, should anyone think that's a good 
idea.

5. Yet some other alternative.

Ideas on a good way past this block are welcome.

Thanks for all the previous ideas, too.

Subject: [PLUG] IP aliases and setting up mail relays...
Message-ID: <1093654632.29312.61.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Say I want to masquerade as a different ip to match a hidden mail server
named foo by naming this different ip, foo.  Currently, I masquerade to
the ip of gate1 or the ip of gate2.



/-----------\     /------------\
|Masq gate1 |     | Masq gate2 |
\-----------/     \------------/
     |                    |
     |                    |
     ----------------------
                |
                |
         ----------------
         | Mail Hub foo |
         ----------------



I've called 209.210.202.172 foo outside
and I've called 192.168.1.2 foo inside.
I not only want the helo to say foo,
I want the connected from ip to match
foo's ip.

If I try to masquerade in iptables 
through an eth0:0 and dynamically set 
that up on gate1 or gate2, I know I'll 
get an error from the strange interface
name.

Let's say the dns is like this outside:

gate1   A   209.210.202.170
gate2   A   209.210.202.171
foo     A   209.210.202.172 

( Note: My original thought was to add a second interface 
        to the hidden hub or move it out. )

Can I change my external dns to this?

gate1 A 209.210.202.170
gate2 A 209.210.202.171
foo   A 209.210.202.170
foo   A 209.210.202.171

My other though is using postfix's relayhost 
directive, but that would only allow me to 
specify one of my two gateways resulting in 
no redundancy.  I have an incoming
relay set up on gate1 and gate2 already.  

ftp://ftp.robinson-west.com/mail_relay/postfix

My goal is to is to be passable by someone
else who uses Postfix-2.1.1's helo checks.

Is the solution a single partially open relay
on the public subnet that all of my hidden
mail servers relay to?  I only have one mail
hub now, but maybe I'll want more of these in
the future.

Sure it's stable and reliable... but not to the point where you won't
have any outages in three years.  At the two locations we have DSL[0],
they both have had multiple outages over the last two years lasting
several hours at times.

Your definition of 'society' is too strict for me.  I think the St. Paul
community would disagree with your assertion the community is
uncivilized.  FWIW, the people of this town keep moving back, not moving
away.  There are *many* families who have been here since the town was
founded, after moving over from Little Muddy Creek with the church in
tow.... back around 1860 or so.

After seeing how both Portland and St. Paul work, I dare say St. Paul is
a far better example of civilization (or, at least, what it should be)
than Portland... hell, we don't even have to lock our doors at night.

"Civilization" is perhaps the wrong word.  A better word might be
"infrastructure".  You make a choice when you eschew internet
infrastructure for the sake of something else.  You ought to take
responsibility for your choices.

I'm coming up on four years with no unexpected outages and no outages
over 1 hour caused by anyone but me.

The story appears to be the same for those living anywhere nearby.

The concern isn't whether or not the town is comfortable or happy, but
whether the resources used in the town require incremental energy costs to
get from major distribution centers to the town and the energy costs in
getting people to and from resources not routinely brought to town.

Unless St. Paul is the great unreported self-contained community, it's a
much more wasteful and destructive form of civilization than a more
metropolitan area.

And I haven't locked the doors to my home in three years... and that was
only because we were heading out of town and my girlfriend did it when I
wasn't looking.

Should be abe to plug it in while running even and it just comes up.

What's your address?  Nah, just kidding.  The headaches 
saved from not worrying about Metro City government is 
one good reason to live abroad. 

As far as efficiency is concerned, you can produce your 
own electrical power.  Even if you don't use solar
energy but burn something instead, that's still better 
for the environment than living on the end of a long 
utility line anywhere.  Factor in less congestion 
resulting in more efficient driving, being out of town 
has great potential for reducing ones impact on the 
planet.  Portland's asphalt alone has caused climate 
change.  If people were spread out further who knows, 
maybe there'd be less habitat destruction.

The biggest environmental problem today is excessive
SUV use.  They are a bigger problem in these so 
called wonderful cities than they are in the wide 
open middle of nowhere.  If more people would even
drive smaller convential cars, we'd be so much 
better off.  5 miles to the gallon better over a
million vehicles becomes significant.  

We should use the already adequate fuel cell 
technology we have now, but nobody is planning 
on selling vehicles taking advantage of it for 
years to come.  The greatest environmental act 
possible is funding early deployment of fuel 
cell cars with government grants so that the
cost of a fuel cell car drops far enough for
the average car buyer to switch to one now.

Subject: [PLUG] Alpha power supply blew...
Message-ID: <1093673519.31694.29.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I think the motherboard and alpha cpu are okay though.  It looks 
like an ATX 400W power supply, but it's a little strange.  My 
PC164 motherboard doesn't take a power switch like a PC does.  
The power switch was wired into the power supply directly.  
Strangely, the output connector is an ATX style one.  It says 
Senstron on the power supply cover, but I doubt that that 
means much.  With most ATX power supplies, they expect the 
power switch to be wired through the motherboard.  I doubt 
that I can get the power supply fixed.  I hardly see how 
I'm going to replace it either because I don't think it's
a standard part.

The cdrom opened using an old AT power supply I had.  Chances 
are, it didn't spike the motherboard when it went.

It's an old Enorex Microsystem that I got back in 1998, right 
before they went belly up.  Why did they go out of business
anyways?

I'd like to note you don't need the "--initrd" option during compilation
if you're not using an initrd.

What is the panic message? (some kernel messages might not be obvious to
you at first glance, but generally they do give pretty good pointers to
the problem)

Make sure the kernel is attempting to mount the right filesystem as the
root filesystem. Most likely you either left out, or built as a module
some driver needed to mount your root filesystem. Did you build ELF
support into the kernel? I'd tend to second J Freyley's pointer, you left
out part of the IDE support. Try running `lspci`, this should give you a
pointer to what your IDE chip is.

Try "modprobe psmouse". (The device node to use is usually

DarkHorse,
~    First off, an unused result warning is most likely non-critical.

~    As for your PS/2 mouse, make sure you have

Thanks.  I found out that make oldconfig after tweaking
with menuconfig is a really good way to verify the .config
will compile.  I need a newer quota on my redhat 9 system 
to use that feature and I can't get a version on oprofile.
Some other tools might be too old too, though I'm not using
pcmcia.

My ASUS CRW-5232AS will hopefully work now.  Without it, I
can't burn fedora to cd.  Under Redhat 9, can I use something
to upgrade to fedora similar to the way gentoo emerges?

The obscure part of getting 2.6 working is messing around in
rc.sysinit and halt.  There's a mount that has to be added
for /sys and some name changes that have to happen too for

Do I still have to use scsi-emulation support to get X-Cdroast to
work with the 2.6 kernel?  I thought the standard atapi support
is what people are supposed to use now.  Maybe my X-Cdroast isn't
2.6 aware?  I wish this burner was 2.4 compatible.

How do I get the e100 module to auto load at boot?  I'm not familiar
with this modprobe.conf file.

Has everyone heard about the Phillips webcam controversy?  Apparently,
there was a hook in the kernel that was only intended for the use of
proprietary code to access high resolution pictures beyond 160x120
resolution.  Well, after being in there three years it got yanked
and the author of the driver has asked that even the GPL'ed portion
be pulled out.  There's quite a long thread on this mess of
people going back and forth over proprietary code and the kernel
Fears came out that something else will get jerked too.  There
were some claims that Nemosoft abused the open source community
though far more claims that the decision to drop the hook is
overarching.

Install the appropriate fedora-release RPM, make sure your /etc/yum.conf
is sane, and "yum upgrade".

In modules.conf add:
alias eth0 e100

You may also want to steer it to speed and duplex by adding another
line.

options e100 e100_speed_duplex=N

Where N = 1 for 10 half duplex
2 10 full duplex
3 100 half duplex
4 100 full duplex

Subject: [PLUG] Partition mounting (fstab)
Message-ID: <20040830045156.25868.qmail@web50605.mail.yahoo.com>

I am currently using SuSE 9.1. It is the only Linux
distro I have ever used that does not add the Windows
partition to fstab if it finds it. Anyhow, I did:

/dev/hda1   ntfs    /mnt/hda1   user,ro    0 0

It was my intention to allow unprivileged users to
access this partition in read-only mode, and once
again, in any other Linux distro, it has worked. But
the error message I get is "Permission not granted."

Probably the permissions on the mount point are the
problem. How should they be assigned? I am willing to
use a different mount point, if that makes things
easier, but preferably not in a specific home directory.

I've often been annoyed by web sites that disable right click.  This
morning I was pushed over the edge, and I tracked down the way to
keep right click working.  This feature was added earlier this year.

>From http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86193

Here's the layman's explanation:

1. In the address bar, type about:config and press Enter
2. Search for a Preference named dom.event.contextmenu.enabled
3. Double click its entry and change it to "false" (without the quotes)

Mozilla will now show the context menu even in pages that try to hide or replace it.

I am running Suse 9.0, which did add this entry into /etc/fstab:

/dev/hda2            /windows/C           ntfs 
ro,users,gid=users,umask=0002,nls=iso8859-1 0 0

(all one line)

The umask field is where the permissions are set, and are the inverse of 
  the numerical chmod settings. In my case, root, and my group have all 
permissions (0's), others have read only (the 2). The umask settings can 
not be over-ridden by chmod. In any case, ntfs will disallow writes.

Subject: [PLUG] Strange Shutdown & Reboot Problems
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0408300856570.7429@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Several weeks ago the power supply failed on my main system (RH 7.3). I
replaced that, and updated the ancient floppy drive, and booted the system
into the same 2.4.19 kernel I've been running the past couple of years.

  Then I discovered the floppy drive cable was upside down (a keyed cable
does no good when the socket is keyed on both sides) so I halted the system
to fix this problem. The shutdown process hung when trying to umount /usr.
Messages about it not being available and umount2 having other problems.
Very strange. Never saw this before on any system. I turned off the box with
the power switch and proceeded to fix the floppy drive cable. Sewed it up
and booted into the 2.4.19 kernel.

  A week or so ago I discovered that the cdrom drive was not recognized by
the system. I assumed the problem was a poorly seated cable from my previous
surgery on the box and I postponed fixing it because there are more
important things to do.

  Yesterday morning seemed like a good time to fix the cdrom drive cable.
When shutting down the system it hung at the same point as before. Held in
the power switch until it expired. Fixed the loose cable (one side was out a
bit) and put the case together. Plugged everyone in and powered on. Kernel
panic when trying to initialize VFS. How strange! Also, saw messages about
problems with USB which should not be there as I have no USB sockets on this
box and did not build the 2.4.19 kernel with USB support.

  To make a long story shorter, it will not boot the 2.4.19 kernel any
longer. The only reason it's now up and running is that I could boot into
single user mode with the 2.4.18-10 kernel, then telinit 3 to switch to
multiuser mode. No NFS. No VMware. Printing didn't work (but cupsd is
running). Figuring it was time to upgrade kernels after a couple of years I
downloaded 2.4.27 and ran make menuconfig (no USB support at all), followed
by make dep; clean; bzImage; modules; modules_install. Moved the kernal and
System.map to /boot, rebuilt the soft links and fixed /boot/grub/grub.conf
to place the new kernel first. Tried rebooting into the 2.4.27 kernel.
Exactly the same response as with the 2.4.19 kernel! USB issues and hanging
on VFS init. As far as I can tell, the process is identical on both the
2.4.19 and 2.4.27 boot sequences.

  So, here I am running 2.4.18-10 with a partially-crippled system and
absollutely no clue what happened or why the new kernel won't boot. And --
of course -- it's the end of the month with all the administrative and
last-minute project work to be completed by tomorrow afternoon. A brand new
experience for me. I need help.

Thanks,

Rich

What sort of motherboard are you attempting to boot? I had an IDE
problem recently with both a Debian 2.4.27 and 2.6.8 kernel on a later
Intel P3 motherboard. It turned out I had to have the PIIX IDE support
compiled in for the IDE bus to even be recognized. Modules (as the stock
Debian kernel packages typically provide) didn't cut it.

   We're using a low-end box as a mail spool and want to determine if the

Or if I'm all confused with the terminology point me in the correct

'iostat' and for long-term data, sar.  Usually part of the 'sysstat'
package.  The first question, of course, is whether it's actually
causing problems or if you're just worried.

Thanks Wil,

I'm not too worried but the Tech Manager is.  I just need to ammunition to 
point fingers at the 'actual' mailserver (Win2K) behind the the spool and 
the amount of virus it is having to scan.  Plus about half the incoming 
mail is not using the primary MX record for whatever reason (spammer 
trick, primary busy, etc.)

I know -- of -- iostat but never had a reason to use it.  My servers are
SCSI and the workstations etal. might be IDE.

Thansk for the reminder.

Within a day of implementing a new secondary MX it was being inundated with
traffic.  In the last day email for over 2000 unique addresses was submitted.
Which is mighty peculiar for a system with perhaps 20 unique actual addresses.

Huh?

   mount: Not a directory

The target is demonstrated to be a directory.  So mount is giving up the
wrong error message.  

Cluestick anyone?

Rich's post was my first guess, but if that doesn't work, you can always
try:
[root at newbox mnt]# mount -t iso9660 -o loop /root/cd.iso /mnt/cdrom

Ooops.  Wrong history grab:

  
   [root at newbox mnt]# ls -l /root/cd.iso
   -rw-r--r--    1 root     root     673635508 Aug 30 11:17 /root/cd.iso
   [root at newbox mnt]# ls -ld /mnt/iso

   [root at newbox mnt]# mount  -o loop /root/cd.iso /mnt/iso
   mount: Not a directory
   [root at newbox mnt]# mount -t iso9660  -o loop /root/cd.iso /mnt/iso
   mount: Not a directory
   [root at newbox mnt]#

Now the names match up as originally intended and Dan's question is answered also.

I ran into this problem on Red Hat systems in high school (and nowhere
else).  Try removing the mount point and recreating it yourself.

Is it possible to encrypt the user/pass to Squid?

For example, let's say your company has a Squid proxy and each user is allowed
or denied Internet access using a login/pass.  Sending your login/pass to Squid
uses Basic Authentication, however, which can be easily decoded.

Also, if others have a better solution for authenticating users for web access,
I'd love to here.
Thanks,

Try running `fsck` on the mount point filesystem (root I imagine?).

I was going to suggest running "strace -t mount -t iso9660  -o loop
/root/cd.iso /mnt/iso" to see which system call failed, but on my system
that just causes "mount" to hang.

A simple tunnel would require you to point your browser at 
localhost:XXX, but what happens when you want to access google.com?

On a controlled network, you can setup iptables rules to silently 
redirect outbound packets to the proxy host.

Unfortunately, the sort of situation I envision is for off-site users 
gaining access to sites that restrict access based on IP address. For 
example, our library subscribes to some online services, but only 
machines in our netblock can access them. If you're off-site (think 
adjunct profs, people on sabbatical, etc.), you're locked out.

A secure, authenticate proxy (sans VPN) would be a simple, elegant 
solution.

  OK, budding entrepreneurs. Here's an opportunity to learn something
valuable for your business (for those of you who _are_ in business with a
plan to succeed, not fail). You'll also find the OEF events a great
networking opportunity.

  Last month a couple of adventurous folks showed up from the PLUG. See you
there this month, too?

OEF Speakeasy: "Five Things that Will Kill Your Business and How to Avoid
Them"

Wednesday, Sept 8, 2004

Presented by OEF & StarveUps

Say you face a decision about your business -- perhaps whether to launch a
new product (or kill it), perhaps adding or removing a key team member, even
accepting the term sheet from the investors you just have an awkward feeling
about. Maybe it's shifting the company's resources to attack a different
market segment. Any one of these decisions would be difficult.

Now imagine that you made the wrong choice, or something happened that put
your company in harm's way. Suddenly, this decision could hasten the demise
of your company. What the hell do you do now?

If this hasn't happened to you yet, chances are good that it will.

OEF and StarveUps have put together September's OEF Speakeasy with this very
disaster in mind. We'll be addressing issues that have (or have almost)
killed real businesses, with panelists who experienced this situation and
either pulled it together and won or who didn't and failed. What did they
learn? What would they do differently next time? Come and find out so you
won't fail.

What does the following show?

    ls /dev/loop*

 Do the loop devices exist? If not you might not have loop support in 
your kernel. Try the following:

    lsmod | grep loop

if you get nothing there, try

    modprobe loop

Unless I'm missing a huge piece of the puzzle (always a possibility, I 
hastily admit), there's no protocol specific to browser-to-proxy 
communications.

If there were, then browsers could encapsulate normal http connections 
in some sort of protected/encrypted communication with the proxy. The 
proxy would accept the inbound https connection as a sort of 
pre-connection. From there, the proxy would initiate whatever http or 
https connection the browser intended to have with the remote site.

At that point, the browser-proxy connection becomes very VPN-like, a 
pretty heavy overlay on HTTP, which is supposed to be a simple 
protocol. :-/

Why?

Squid on a central server, an ssh tunnel on each separate machine from
port 8080 to the squid machine,

point their proxy at localhost:8080

should work. Can't test it. Might be wrong.

Browsers use HTTP to talk to the proxy.  The proxy opens up a separate 
HTTP connection to the server, make its request, and send the response 
to the client.  There is no reason that client-to-proxy could not be 
over SSL while the proxy-to-server is unencrypted.

SSL to the server is different since the client and server need to talk 
directly for end-to-end security.  Proxies support the dangerous CONNECT 
command which turns HTTP into a direct connection.  This would create 
double-SSL on the client-proxy leg but that should work.

Ah, that's where putty comes in handy.  Set the defaults to the

Yes.  I would suggest you do this.
Set up Apache with SSL on a subdomain.  ssl.example.com
Then inside that sub domain set these
ProxyPass  http://yoursquid.com
ProxyPassReverse http://yoursquid.com

Then from your main page just redirect them to ssl.example.com or
where ever you want the authenication to happen.  The browser to
Apache will be encrypted and apache will forward all request to the
squid server which could then do all the routing.  I'd put the Apache
and Squid server on the same machine.  Then you just redirect to
localhost:squidport

Is that closer to what you want?  Does that help or do you also need
encyption to the squid server?  Just a note, encryption will be
slightly slower but the most easiest method I can think of right now.

You could also setup another form of authenication in apache and turn
on cookie authenication in Apache and have it create and manage
session identifiacation for you.  Not sure you want to do that but it
does exisit.  I haven't done that in about 6 months so I'll look that
up and see where I put that bit of knowledge.  Then you could use
DIGEST instead of BASIC and not have to use SSL.

But then again with DIGEST Authenication you can still crack it if you
want.  How secure do you want the connection?

I also just read a bit about Squid.
http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/FAQ-1.html#ss1.12
says that Squid can do all the SSL traffic tunneling for you.  You
just need to have Squid configured to allow SSL.  I'm still not
convienced though that you want Squid to do the SSL.  It may not
matter but I would seperate them.

Apologies for getting all pedantic, but I think the outcome of that umask 
will be:

  777 (default)
  002 (umask)
  ---
  775 (final permissions)

so, read & execute, not just read-only.

Yes, the sanity check that the basic homework was done pans out:
   
  [root at cmclink root]# ls /dev/loop*
  /dev/loop0  /dev/loop10  /dev/loop12  /dev/loop14  /dev/loop2  /dev/loop4  /dev/loop6  /dev/loop8

  [root at cmclink root]# lsmod | grep loop
  loop                   12696   0  (autoclean)

This problem resists googling also.   For the instances of google searches I've tried.

Sorry,  I can in late..

If umask is 002 it will generate files of 664

You cannot create files execuatable.  You must always make them
executable.

At least that is my experience

It's a software install CD for a backup client.  We dd'ed it from 
CD to iso.  It mounts fine on other systems in house - this RHEL
system is the only one so far that won't mount it.

Well then I don't know. I have found that if you create an iso file from 
a multisession CD some versions of mount have problems mounting the 
file. So I guess that this is not he problem you are running into as I 
find it hard to believe that your backup client CD was created as a 
multisession CD. What OS are the other systems running that will mount 
the image?

Glad I'm not the only one puzzled by this question. 

RedHat 9, mount-2.11 in all cases too.

Subject: [PLUG] Reading/Writing Binary Files with PHP
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0408311203320.9884-100000@gisnet.com>

Is it possible to write binary data to a file with PHP? When I try this:

$data = 128;
$fp = fopen ("test.bin", "w+b");
fwrite ($fp, (int) $data);
fclose ($fp);

I get a file called test.bin that has the string "128" in it, and not the 
binary 0x0080 value. 

I didn't find any useful answer on Google; just people asking a similar 
question and others answering not with an answer but with another 
question, "Why do you want to do that?"

So before anyone asks, I want to do this because I want to create a
look-up index into another file that contains lines of text. If I want to
access, say, the 25th line, I want to go into the index file, jump to the
25th long int in the index, and retrieve the offset to the 25th line in
the text file.

Never mind... The answer is yes. I solved it by use of the pack() and
unpack() functions.  Like so:

  $data = 128;
  $fp = fopen ("test.bin", "w+b");
  fwrite ($fp, pack ("L", $data));

  // read it back...
  fseek ($fp, 0, SEEK_SET);
  $bindata = fread ($fp, 4);
  fclose ($fp);

  $arr = unpack ("Lval", $bindata);
  $data = $arr["val"];

Perhaps the file got currupted somehow. If you run an md5sum on it, does it checkout with the original file, or one that mounts elsewhere?

Here is a wild guess.  There are two spaces between the "mount" and the
-o.  So mount thinks you are trying to mount " ".  Which of course is
not a directory.

Is this command by chance in a script?

Good Luck,

Personally I keep all my debian boxes up to date with this in
root's crontab

00 00 * * * /usr/bin/apt-get -qq update; /usr/bin/apt-get -d -qq
dist-upgrade
00 01 1,15 * * /usr/bin/apt-get autoclean >/dev/null
10 01 * * * /usr/bin/dpkg --get-selections > /etc/apt/apt.files

The last one dumps a daily list of all packages installed in debian. 
It's useful if you need to rebuild a box, or build a new box with the
same package listing...
