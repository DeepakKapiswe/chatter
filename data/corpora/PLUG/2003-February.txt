Message-ID: <3E3B9608.4060604@onlinemac.com>

Greetings...

I'm currently evaluating two different schools... and I thought I would 
get your feedback.

I'm interested in a BS in CS or BA in BA(Management) with a minor in the 
other.
(Possibly a multi-discipline degree, and feedback on that?)

As for other schools... Well, I live in Sheridan (By Spirit Mountain 
Casino)... so I would prefer not driving 45+ minutes to school.
So Newberg, McMinnville, Salem, Monmoth, Lincoln City are all within 
reason.
Outside of that it would have to be a REALLY good reason.

Anyways any thoughts... concerns... gotchas... etc... that I need to 
know of?

We've had pretty good luck with our wireless access points (WAPs) out

I've been using an ATT cable modem for a couple of years now.  Works
great.  Then again, I don't need high upload speeds or a server.  (I
rent server space at a professional co-lo.)  My total downtime is less
than 8 hours in two years.

Yes, get a wireless hub.  If it's all wood frame, you should have no
problems going through the wood up two stories.  Linksys makes a nice
firewall/NAT-router/wireless unit for somewhere under $150, if I
recall.  And then you'd need wireless adaptors for each unit to be
attached... USB/802.11b can be as cheap as $60 (I'm using one on my
TiVo).

You're being pedantic.  The only difference between the two
is that the second one will stop one line early if the last
line is "0" without a newline.

That's such a rare case that Perl programmers didn't worry about it
for 11 years of Perl's existence.

Please to not be pulling up red herrings.  Thank you.

OK, now I call your bluff.  I've said repeatedly here that
except for the case where you have a file ending in a character
zero not followed by a newline, THESE TWO LOOPS DO THE SAME THING.

And if you wrote them in the manner recommended by manpages
before the DWIMming logic was added, they'd do the *exact* same thing:

while (defined (my $line = <IN>)) { ... }

sub in { return <IN> } while (defined (my $line = in())) { ... }

There.  Those do *exactly* the same thing.  And in fact, between Perl
4 and Perl 5.004, so did the two loops you posted.  5.004 was made
smarter to insert the "defined" that everyone kept forgetting to put
in, so that's the ONLY REASON they do something different now.  To
help YOU in the common case.

Gah.

Please stop lying.  I find you with a much stronger hidden agenda now.

Learn Smalltalk, from the guys who invented it, so that you can
learn a *proper* OO language.  And there's lots of pretty moving
thingies in the first five minutes of exposure.  Keeps the kids
interested.

Smalltalk - if you say you know OO but haven't seen Smalltalk, you
don't know OO yet. :) Hint: Java, C++, Python, Perl are *not* true OO
languages... see how the granddaddy did it.

For all platforms, there's the integrated Emacs support in the

Yes, this is one big problem if your only access to something like PHP
is as a web browser response.  It's tough enough getting a CGI "hello world"
app running under a server... trying to debug your PHP web app would be
10 times worse.

Especially for a beginner.

And just so it doesn't look like I'm a wild fanatic zealot, I'm well
aware of Perl's shortcomings, and would be happy to discuss them.
(Heck, the entire "perl6" effort is about correcting a good number of
those...)

But you haven't even come close to hitting on *any* of them yet.  Just
spreading the usual FUD about "hard to read" and "undisciplined"
and "not suitable for large projects/beginners" etc etc.

Hence, I'm required to defend Perl's honor. :)

Not exactly.  Recent Perls turn the first one into:

  while (defined (my $line = <IN>) ) { ... }

which protects against the "last line is digit 0 without a newline"
problem.  I said this already in a previous post.

Alice,

I've had AT&T cable since it was @home, and I think I
was the first guy in Oregon City to have it, as I kept
calling them weekly.

I have been very happy with the service. For the two
or three years that it was @home, downtime was very
rare: I think it was down once for a half day, then
down a couple times for a couple hours, which I think
is pretty good for two or three years.

When it switched to AT&T, I was down for about a day.
Others were down for a week or more though. I was up
because I was set statically, but others I knew were
down because they were set dynamically and AT&T seemed
to be having problems with DHCP.

Since then (a year ago) I think I've had one downtime
of a couple hours.

Connection is really fast. When it was @home, it was
2.3 mbit/sec down, but sending was capped at 128k,
which was a bit slow for me.

When it switched to AT&T, now it's 1.9 mbit down, but
they bumped uploads to 256k, which was a nice
improvement.

Anyway, our service is $45/month, plus 3 or 4 dollars
tax.

Most people I know that have DSL have 256k/256k, or
possibly 384k/384k. Most of them are pretty happy with
their service too, though their download speeds are
only a fraction of cable.

One argument against cable is that it's "share" with
your neighbors. I don't know how many people my
connection is shared with, but I pretty much always
download at full speed from decent servers (190
k/sec), even during peak times, so for me this has
been a non-issue. My connection it work is a 384k/384k
DSL, and it always seems really slow, downloading
around 35k/sec max.

Also worth noting: the Oregon Dept. of Revenue has fill-in-PDF

And before you go thinking that the DOR web admins have a sense of

up with an idea...

The project is accepting small image files from folks, most easily via

no bigger than 10 or 15KB in size....

Does such a system exist which would easily allow me to do this?  That
is, procmail would deliver the message, then this *thing* would take
just the attachment from the message and move it into another
directory?  That other folder could then be rsync'd with somebody who
has more bandwidth via a cron job or something....

But does anybody know of such a thing that will screen emails to make
sure they are under 20KB in size, then decode them, just putting the
attachment into a seperate directory?

This is all very preliminary, I'd just like to not re-invent the wheel
if at all possible... I would think such a thing should be possible with
procmail, some mime utilities, and some fancy bash scripting....

Uh... aren't you making this kind difficult for no reason?

You could just pipe the mails to a script that runs uudecode or munpack
and puts the file in /tmp and then only moves it if the size is alright
and sends a reply mail if it's too big (or whatever you need to do).

  Bureaucrats have no sense of humor.

  Dry cleaners need separate forms so the information doesn't evaporate too
quickly. Also, the forms cannot contain any VOCs[1] or they get in trouble
with DEQ and EPA.

After I fired off that email, I realized this could be made a lot
easier...

And I think your way even is easier than what I was thinking.

That's what I get for starting off thinking about how difficult this

I understand Jean Auel will be there, giving a talk about her days working
at Tektronix as a technical writer.

(I was amazed when I heard this, & insisted that it had to be another
``local famous writer", but my source insisted that Ursula LeGuin is not
savvy enough, technology-wise, to interest Tim O'Reilly in anything she
might write.)

I'm not sure what the next one will be called.  The whole UnitedLinux thing 
is confusing the issue.  I don't know if 8.2 will be based on UnitedLinux 
(since that is just SuSE, there won't be much difference).

It is.  I suspect that Red Hat purchased companies like Cygnus to jump 
start the revenue flow from services.  Smart move if that's what they were 
doing.

I think that building a specialty distro is getting harder than it was.  As 
packages mature and integrate, it is going to become more difficult to 
trim off what you don't want.  If you stay with binary packages at least.  
I think that the next real wave of specialty distros will probably emerge 
from the various source-based distros.

I believe that several trends support this opinion.  First, computers are 
getting faster and faster so that compile time is dropping into the realm 
of the supportable (it's still too long, but it is getting much better).  
Second, the upstream packages are getting more sophisticated about 
integrating with other software on the system.  Have GNOME? Then the Gtk 
version will be built.  Have KDE? Then the Qt version will be built.  
Third, the upstream packages are starting to standarize on use of 
autoconf, standard build arguments and behavior, and use of LSB-compatible 
defaults.

The first time I built the Linux kernel, it was on some sort of 486 machine 
and the build took many hours (8? I can't remember).  Now, I've got an 
elderly P-II system and the kernel only takes a few minutes to build.  
Another speed up of the same magnitude and the worst packages (OpenOffice 
comes to mind) will be buildable in a few minutes.  Obviously things are 
not this simple, but I think the trends hold.

Best,
Kyle

Hi.

I haven't had a ppp connection in ages and I've never had to set up PPP
for anybody who wasn't pretty savvy from the start.

So, here's my situation.

There's this box at a friends' that is used by everyone in the house.
They've got a dial-up account that they want to use through this machine.

So what (non-KDE) graphical tools are run as regular users for connecting
when they need internet?  Disconnect?

I need a tool that's simple and dockable and times out after a period of
disuse and doesn't require setup for each user (i.e., a new user can be
created in a month and it'll just work for them).

Any pointers accepted.

You should be able to set it up so it dials on demans, i.e. when you try
to use the internet, it will dial out and if the link is idle for a
specific amount of time it will drop it.  How you do thi will depend on
what distro you use

This is a marketing myth.  Cable you share with your neighbor before
the router, DSL you share with your neighbor after the DSLAM, what's
the difference?

There are a couple things DSL has over cable (and vice versa).  Security
is a bit less on a cable network.

The primary reason I prefer DSL is freedom of ISP.  This is very
important for competition and keeping service reliable and cheap
(regardless of the failure of the LEC's to cooperate in some
situations).

Comparing the options, in the last couple years Qwest has seemed to pull
ahead of Verizon with bandwidth choices and ease of moving ISP's.  They
did screw their customers by moving everyone to MSN a while back.

When cable will allow me to say "your IP service sucks, please move my
traffic to <x> local ISP", then I will consider them a competitor for my
business, even if they are faster than DSL in some cases (downstream).

Additionally, though they all suck, DSL user agreements seem to play a
bit nicer than those with AT&T.  I do not want to be thrown in jail for
putting up a PTP node.

Exactly, at least with the Internet connection you can choose your
provider. Competition is the very core of effective markets.

I would never in a million years get cable access. Hell, I don't even have
cable television and will not get it unless a competitive system develops.
As it stands I will not be overcharged by monopolies.

http://www.click-network.com/news/PR_M.HTM
December 1, 1999

Click! Network and local Internet service provider make history

Tacoma Power?s Click! Network will make history December 1 as the first
telecommunications company in the United States that will give multiple
Internet service providers (ISPs) the ability to provide high- speed Internet
cable modem access to customers over a cable network.


January 1, 1999

Click! Network connects customers in the east area of Tacoma to cable TV!
Customers in the east area of Tacoma are the next lucky citizens to have a
choice in their cable TV provider. 


July 17, 1998

Tacoma residents may soon have another choice when it comes to choosing who
will provide cable television services to their homes and businesses. The
Tacoma City Council on July 21 will consider a 10- year agreement that allows
Tacoma Power?s Click! Network to offer cable television services to city
residents.

If it is an LS-120 then the /dev/fd0 isn't correct. Depending where on the IDE
bus the drive is, it will be /dev/hdX. My guess, if you have an IDE hard drive
based box; the hard drive will be hda, the CDR will be hdc, and the ide-loppy
will be hdd. 

If you can, you should move the ide-floppy to its own channel because it is a
slow device. Any faster drive, 66, 100, 133 MHz device on the same channel,
will have to run at 33MHz.

I understand your sentiment, I too believe competition
is very important to good service and price. In the
case of AT&T's cable modems, it is true that they are
the only choice for cable, but they do have
competition: DSL. Right now I am staying with AT&T
because they are several times faster for downloads
than DSL, and it's cheaper. Also, I have been very
happy with the product: very little downtime, always
fast and stable, etc.

They are not a broadband monopoly, because if they
decide to raise their prices too high, or if their
quality diminishes, I can switch to DSL.

One other reason that I would switch to DSL: at the
moment, my IP address is technically dynamic, but they
could change my IP address if they wanted to. They
have only done this once in a year, but if it began
happening often, I would switch to DSL because I like
to run a web server, and to log in remotely through
ssh, etc, and would want a static IP.

I have been away from PLUG for some months now and was wondering if
someone could bring me up to date on some things:

What has been happening in PLUG these days? Anything new and interesting?

What is the deal with this O'reilly conference in July here in Portland?
Any local people (PLUG members in particular) going to be speaking? Having
it here in Portland seems like a good thing for Portland, right?

Also, anyone know how this conference works, in terms of admission fees,
events, etc.?

Personally, I am excited by such an event happening here. Do you plug list
members feel excited about this?

Thanks.

I work for a cable company (but have DSL, because of the AUP and upstream 
speed) and I have seen some interesting developments recently.  We're moving 
to a new IP provisioning system and inplementing subinterfaces on the Cable 
Routers.  This will allow us to have other ISP as providers.  I don't know 
what are company management decision is on this, however our engineering 
group is plannig for this possibility.

As to cable being less secure than DSL, who ever claimed that one was more 
secure than another.  Depend on ISP protecting themselves, not their 
customers.  If they start getting in the protection business, they've just 
add a whole slew of management issues they really don't want or need to deal 
with.
The only security that we provide is to protect our equipment and services, 
the customers are on their own.  We recommend virus scanners/firewall for all 
our customers.

Sean,

Did you say that your cable company is setting up a system whereby other
ISPs will be able to act as the ISP? Would this work the way the
relationship between telcos and ISPs works now or what?

Generally, I think this is good news as it provides for more competition
at least in the Internet part of things.

It is my understanding that the data going to/from a cable modem within 
the cable network is encrypted. Once the data leaves the cable network 
and enters other public networks it's as vulnerable as any other 
network traffic. What does DSL have that makes it more secure? My guess 
is that once the data enters other public networks is no more secure 
than any other data unless the data is already encrypted just like data 
from a cable network.

Also in someways a cable network may be a bit more secure since 
vulnerable SMB ports are automatically blocked so people using Windows 
systems can't have any shared filesystems and/or printers accessed by 
others. This is a good thing since most users don't have a clue on how 
to properly secure their systems. I've not heard of DSL blocking access 
to SMB ports.

Still without any port filtering or firewalling a system running 
vulnerable services will be just as vulnerable on a cable network as it 
is on a DSL network. Certainly I know people with DSL connections that 
can do some filtering and other functionality with their DSL router 
that can help make things more secure but you have to understand how to 
access and configure the router properly. I've read that my cable modem 
may have some port filtering capabilities and other stuff but I don't 
have any documentation on how to access my cable modem or anything 
since the modem was supplied by AT&T and the user documentation is very 
minimal. 

We have our house networked and with multiple email addresses included 
we've found cable modem access to be a very good and cheap way of 
achieving high speed internet connectivity for multiple users at home. 
I know DSL is available to me as well but in looking at what is 
available the downlink speeds don't seem to come close to what I get 
with my cable modem connection. Also the price difference isn't worth 
it to take such a big hit in the down link speed.

I never implied that this was something we are actively pursuing, only that 
engineering is building it into our new model.

The way it would work would be that the cable company would provide layer's 
1-3 and all other services (except DHCP) would be provided by the ISP.  The 
ISP would have to buy a circuit into our core and traffic on their 
sub-interfaces on the ubr's would be routed to them.  They would provide tier 
1&2 troubleshooting, mail, news etc.  We would provide 
installer/troubleshooters in each market as well, that could be billed back 
to the ISP.

Not so the data is only "encrypted" within the DOCSIS spec.  It's not "real" 
ethernet that can be intercepted with traditional ethernet tools, however the 
same broadcast and transmissions are still seen on the ethernet side of all 
cable modems.

This also isn't true in all senses.  ATT might do this (I don't know) we have 
discussed block SMB/NFS/XPWin/Appletalk ports at the cable modem to provide 
basic security to our customer, to protect them from our customers, however 
we having implemented this yet.

  I'm trying to make the fonts displayed by sylpheed larger for my fiancee.
In the tools menu there's a preferences item that contains a display tab. I
can make the font size 24 pts there (and find a font that's on the system
that will display at that size), but the only change is in the text of a
received message. The header of the message, the list of messages in her
inbox, the menu tree to the left all remain very small. All text in the
compose window is also small

  Does anyone have a suggestion what I can do?

  I ran /usr/sbin/chkfontpath and discovered that the 100dpi font directory
is down quite a way in the list, but I don't recall how to modify the paths
now that they're not all listed in /etc/X11/XF86Config-4.

Rich,

You may want to change the resolution of your screen.  That is probably
easier.  You could program you monitor on various resolutions and your
fiance can change the resolution on the screen when she wants to read
email.

The difference is that usually, if it's configured properly, your neighbors 
can't see your SMB shares over DSL, ever. On Cable, your neighbors can see 
your SMB shares.

Of course, this assumes that you DON'T run a firewall, and that you DO have 
things shared.

Oh contrar.  Neighbors can see anything you put on the net with DSL.  If
you have a fixed IP, even better.  This is why all the chatter about
firewalls.  Cable, DSL, phone lines via PPP.  All connect to the
internet.  All are vulnerable.  All need some kind of firewall.

I think what people were trying to do is compare the level of security
between the two - if cable encrypts information going from the modem to
the ISP, then they are a level ahead of where they used to be, where it
was like each cable user was plugged in to a hub, everybody getting
every packet, essentially... at least, that is how I understood it.

My DSL allows broadcast packets through on the local subnet - as such, I
get hit by 10.0.0.1 a lot on DHCP and bootp ports and from actual IPs
for Windoze share stuff.

Most DSL isn't like this, though....

Good morning Randall. Aren't you even going to tell us Plug people the
name of your new book ahead of time so we can have inside information?

Ken,

  Thanks for mentioning this as it brings up a problem I had forgotten: I
cannot change the display resolution on that workstation. In
/etc/X11/XF86Config-4's display section it shows the resolutions as:

Subsection "Display"
                Depth       24
                Modes       "1024x768" "800x600" 
        EndSubsection

but, pressing ctrl-alt-- and ctrl-alt-+ have no effect other than to make
the displays briefly flash. I'm not sure that I know how to figure out what
broke there.

Thanks,

Rich

        It was compiled by Mandrake and included in their 9.0
        distribution.

        Just after I posted my request for help here
        on PLUG, I submitted a bug report to Mandrake
        (https://qa.mandrakesoft.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi).  About
        18 hours later I got an email back asking me to download
        and try a bugfix.  The bugfix worked great and I'm back
        in business with tripwire-2.3.1.  What outstanding
        support that was!

        Happy, happy, joy, much joy....

They can't see smb, as it won't travel through a router. It's a limitation

I tend to agree.  Building speciality distributions may become much more
difficult, and in the future one may want to build more and more from
source code.  This is unfortunate, because I think it is faster and
easier to build as much as possible from binaries.  Why, you ask?
Well, the build times are a minor consideration.  However, I prefer using
binaries whenever practical, because the parent distribution has
already done a good deal of quality assurance that is relevant to the
new distribution.   I always feel the need to do more testing when I
compile from source code; and testing is very very time consumming.
Indeed, testing is time consumming even when working from "well tested"
binaries from an established distribution.

Fortunately for distribution builders, I think Debian will remain a
good distribution for distribution builders to start from.  I'm less
confident of RedHat, SuSE, and the others.

I also tend to think speciality distributions will become
more and more important in the future, but I'm absolutely sure
of this.  If the general distributions become more better and more
flexible than I expect, or if consummers demand major brand names
in their distributions then this may not happen.  Moreover,
speciality distributions won't become more important until we
geeks learn more about market research and the value of applications.

                                                     Dave

P.S.  I haven't compiled anything on a 486 in a while, but I thought it
only took me 2-4 hours to compile a kernel on my 486/33, and it wasn't
very painful because it usually compiled right.  Other Linux components
like X took a lot longer, and the ones you were actively working on
could be a real pain since you were always fixing something and
recompiling the mess.

Piet,

    I don't know much about individual programs at any of the schools in
this area, but I grew up in Sherwood so I have some general impressions
of the schools.

    I like all the schools in the area (Western Oregon, Linfield, George
Fox, and Willamette).  In general, I like Willamette the best.  I have
employed Willamette graduates.  The two that come to mind were both
Computer Science majors and they were both very good before turning to
the dark side (At least one of them works for MicroSoft.).  I was also
a finalist for a job at Willmette University many years ago.  What
impressed me most about them, was how much the faculty seemed to like
working there.

    Many of my teachers at Sherwood came from George Fox, Linfield, or
Western Oregon.  All of these schools seem reasonable to me.  I suppose,
in general I like Linfield a bit better than Western Oregon and Western
Oregon a bit better than George Fox; but I don't have any good reason
for this.  Also, I think George Fox has grown and improved a lot in
the last 30 years and they were are quite acceptable 30 years ago.

    Of course, what really counts is the quality of the individual
programs and I can't help you in this area.

                                               Good luck,
                                               Dave

I think it's more correct to say that it won't broadcast correctly 
through a router; otherwise, a router is no obstacle. The broadcast 
limitation will decrease a share's visibility via SMB browsing; it 
won't prevent someone from mounting the C$ share...

I can't.  Not because I'm not allowed (although there is *that* too),
but because it hasn't been settled yet.  Within a week or so, says my

that's the conflict.

Scott,

I'm an AT&T customer, and I run my own mail server (using the rationale that 
the bandwidth is the same to AT&T whether I host my mail in my basement, or 
go out to another mail-server somewhere to get it).

However, I haven't had the nerve to put up a webserver, as I can't rationalize 
that violation of the TOS (that's not a moral determination, it's just a lame 
defense if I should ever be asked about it).

That said, I desperately want to run my own website on my own server in my own 
basement. Have you ever been questioned or had any flags raised over this 
technical violation of the AT&T TOS?

Subject: [PLUG] Dealing with security
Message-ID: <1044303546.4262.331.camel@red>

I was asked by two people recently about Linux virus
scanning. One asked why there doesn't seem to be many
or any virus scanning software for Linux that a business
can use. The other wondered why Linux was less susceptible
than Windows.

The first was referring to Linux viruses - not a Linux box
scanning email for Windows clients. I explained that
most Linux deployments in business are as servers
presently and a Linux server managed by an administrator
reasonably well-versed in security is not going to fall
victim to viruses or other form of attack easily.

I explained to both the concepts of daemons running as
root versus a lesser privileged user, not having daemons
running as the same user, restricting a daemon to a
portion of a file system by chrooting it, choosing to
use daemons that don't have a history of security issues,
etc. I said that by using common sense security
precautions, virus attacks are unlikely to succeed and,
if they do, cleanup would be relatively simple.

This was the wrong answer. The first fellow insists that
Linux is equally as vulnerable to virus attack as
Windows. He dismissed my explanation as the rantings
of a "rabid Linux user" - his words. I suspect he thinks
that Linux is not as secure as Windows because there are
no virus scanners available - no other facts matter. I
wonder what he'll think when he finds out that there is no
disk defragger for Linux.

The other didn't accept my explanation because "there are
more security alerts for Linux that there are for Windows.'
and "if Linux was as popular as Windows it would have just
as many security problems" and "wasn't there a Linux
slammer attack?".

Clearly, there's a lot of people out there who don't get it
and technical explanations are lost on them. As Linux is
deployed by more and more people who don't have the
necessary skills and security awareness, Linux is going to
be perceived as a platform just as problematic as Windows.
These people need simpler concepts they can grasp.

I'm thinking that the solution is to shift the emphasis
away from Linux as a secure operating system to the
administrator. It's the administrator who makes a system
secure - not an operating system. When security problems
occur, we should not complain about Windows, we should
complain about administration. If company management puts
the pressure on their administrators to solve security
problems, more secure solutions, like Linux, should
eventually bubble to the top.

I've been running my own web, mail and ftp servers for about a year now
and have had no problems. Of course, my web server doesn't get very many
hits (unless you count the ones coming from nimda-infected machines).

Gang: 

I am investigating an emerging connector spec called HDMI (www.hdmi.org)
which is supposedly the "High Definition Multimedia Interface" slated to take 
over where S-Video and DVI connectors leave off.

Obviously, there may be something of interst to Linux programmers regarding 
writing new drivers, etc.

http://www.hdmi.org/faq/faq.asp

But by the verbiage in the FAQ portion of the page (and besides, just 'who' 
is an "educated digital video consumer" **) it seems that the unstated point 
behind NOT having to switch to "clumsy analog signals" (their words) is more 
like trying to retain 'content control' all the way through to the picture 
tube.

"...enabling new functionality..." Right.

Hello Linux folkz,
It's the first time I hit the wall with Linux.
My wife desperately needs to watch educational videos 
from a medical web site as a part of her preparation 
to medical board exam.
Unfortunately these med. videos made in QuickTime 
format and can't be downloaded as files.
Mozilla on Linux doesn't have any QuickTime plugins.
They're available only for Winblows and Macs.
Should I just give up and pay big bucks to to install
Windoze on one of my computers or there is another
way to deal with this obstacle?
Could somebody please advise any other method to resolve
this problem?
Many thanks in advance.
Alex

Try http://www.codeweavers.com/products/crossover/ . Works great with
their version of wine. The Plugin product is what you want. It has a
free demo and if you like it , its only $24.95.

the Office product is really nice too if you need to run Office, IE,
Quicken, Quickbooks, etc.

For one thing, there are almost as many virus-scanners for Linux as
there are for Windows.  All of the "store brands" have Linux versions of
their scanners:  McAfee, Symantec, etc., as do most of the more focused
brands like Sophos, F-PROT, etc.

He's also right that in many ways, a Linux workstation is as susceptible
as a Windows workstation.  Sure, we do have privileges, chroot jails and
whatnot--but a user-level virus (say, from downloading a binary or
trojaned source) which did nasty things would be equally as devastating
from a user's standpoint--it could delete all your (user-owned) data
files and/or send porn web sites to your entire addressbook, including
your grandmother and customers.  It would no doubt be less effective
because of the heterogeneity of our systems and lack of standardization
and sharing among applications.  (E.g., every mail application has its
own addressbook.)

And let's face it, there's a lot of crappy code out there, particularly
in user-level applications.  And with StarOffice being so compatible
with MS Office, it wouldn't surprise if some of the same Word macro
viruses would work.

We like to think we're safer, but the fact is once we've become
comfortable with that and cease vigilance--we too will fall prey.

The arguments about popularity hold some water, but like most
unqualified generalisations, are not necessarily true.  Using a
rarely-used distro, OS, application means most of the time the
proof-of-concept or skript-kiddie exploits won't work.  It doesn't mean
you're not vulnerable to the flaw in general, but there may not be
active exploits on the net for it.

"educated digital video consumer"

Two Points! But here we have 'education' = PHB-speak for 'persuasion.' When
video 'pirates' of the Far East defeat copy protections it's because they
haven't been 'educated' to understand and accept that a DVD of a 110-min.
movie should 'logically' cost $34.99.  Locally, some would say that Measure
28 failed because the rural populations weren't 'educated' correctly.

Unfortunately, I'm not a programmer, but I'd think that the first step would
be to find a D/A->A/D converter which interposes itself somewhere along the
path, to preserve the anonymity of WHERE the signal goes thereafter - like to
my TV (when? how many times this month? That's "important marketing
information") or to another recording device which, although it remains
within Fair Use, is also 'off their radar screen.'

Crossover may be the easiest option, but mplayer can play QT videos now
and you can use plugger with NS/Moz (I've never really liked plugger,
but it might just be what you need in this situation.)

mplayer is a bear to install.  I tried on several occasions and got
thoroughly confused by the poor installation documentation and had to
give up.  I've been lucky enough not to need any QT or WMV file
support.  I've heard good things about CodeWeavers crossover software.

FWIW,

I know a few people that have done this and as far as I know they 
haven't been nailed by AT&T for violating their EULA which forbids the 
running of a server. These people aren't getting very many hits at all 
but having their own website has proved useful for posting a few 
pictures and other stuff online. If you were running a high traffic 
site on your system you might be detected but given that the up link 
speeds on AT&T aren't that great IMHO, I can't imagine anyone running a 
high traffic web or FTP site through their cable modem service.

I don't run any public servers but I do have sendmail set up on my 
gateway system which accessible to systems on my internal network. I 
have sendmail setup to relay any of my network's own outgoing email 
through AT&T's mail servers. This works fine since my system resides on 
AT&T's network so their email server readily accept email from my 
system.

I did have to do a little configuration work with sendmail so it uses my 
"attbi.com" email address rather than my local userid and bogus domain 
name which I use on my internal network.

I haven't built it in a while (I've got 0.90-pre4) but I managed it
build it even with the "unsupported" Red Hat 2.96 gcc.  IIRC, I had to
read the Makefile to figure out the correct answer to make it build with
that gcc.

Disclaimer: this is a debian-centric solution. but it may work if you
have alien and another distro (sorry, I dont know of a
distribution-generic solution like this.)

If you are using debian, then this apt-source line will allow you to
apt-get install mplayer with much less pain.

deb http://marillat.free.fr unstable main

(apt-get update after adding it to your sources.list of course.)

In order to get quicktime videos to work with mplayer, you also have to 
pull the code from CVS and compile with the correct flags.  It does not 
happen by default.

mplayer is a bitch to get working right.  I have done it, but it took some 
serious voodoo.  (Since broken now that I am running Rawhide on my home 
machine and an even more experimental OS on my laptop.)

I download the tarball, edit the RPM spec to change the version, then
do rpm --ba with the options I want, and install new mplayer RPMs.
Doesn't seem all that hard to me. And it can play more formats than any
other player for Linux, especially after you install the win32 codecs.

And you need them for scanning Windows files and documents.  (FTP servers 
and SMB shares used by marketing people are a prime target for this sort 
of scanning need.)

I have found that the Linux versions are usually more expensive because 
they assume that if you are using Linux, you will be doing "corporate 
work", therefore they can suck more money out of you.

But Linux does not have anything as wide-open as Outlook.  (Where the

Actually we are starting to see some of the same things working, but not 
from OpenOffice as much as Wine.  (Wine is set to run .exe files by 
default with some configurations.)

Actually we are much less vulnerable now.  The question is if we can stay 
that way.

Not with Sophos, but then, Sophos is marketed only towards enterprise
environments, so I guess it doesn't have cheap home-user editions to
begin with.  (Although their license permits employees to use it at home
for no extra charge.)

True, but there have been vulnerabilities in the MIME handling of e-mail
applications under Linux.  There's nothing inherent in the system that
makes user-level applications more secure (unless, of course employing
special tools, like Stack/FormatGuard).

I agree that there is a good deal more attention being given to security

Yes.  I tend to forget that since the current mail servers do not feed 
mail to Windows clients.  (Saving copies for later is important, 
however...)

I am trying to remember if Sophos was the one that wanted to charge me 
$2,000 a year per server.  

When i was testing virus scanners about three years back, the Linux 
versions had some serious problems.  The McAfee versions would either core 
or not detect some viruses. (Mostly macro viruses, which is what I 
needed the most.)  There was not much else available.

I need to test against my collection and see how well the new versions 
work.

Just keeping users from being able to alter system binaries stops 
many of the attacks that Windows exploits like to use.  (Many of the 
windows viruses replace the winsock dll(s) with their own trojaned 
version.) That protection helps a great deal.  (Especially in a multi-user 
environment.)  To get MS Office to work with Multi-user NT, you have to 
give it write access to the system directory.  One infection infects the 
entire userbase all at once.

Special tools help as well, but having proper permissions set helps keep 
the infection limited to a single user, if it happens at all.  (And with 
things like SubDomain, you can nail the process down to the point where, 
even if they can gain a foothold on the machine, it does not help a whole 
lot.)

Unfortunatly, in many places it is just lipservice or DRM masquerading as 
security.  (Security for Microsoft is whether your check clears.)

Subject: [PLUG] up2date not updating
Message-ID: <20030204011339.GA2260@dalsemi.com>

I'm pretty frustrated, so this may not be my most clear email.

I thought I'd sign up for Red Hat's free up2date service to try it out.
So first I ran the configurator, then I ran up2date, which produced a
bunch of output saying it was checking header files and then it
reported that it would not update the kernel because I had asked it not
to.

However, it didn't do or say anything about the other RPMs that need
updating.

Next I tried the RHN website, with similar results.  I selected
the system that I wanted to update.  The website reports back
that the system was scheduled to be updated in two hours.  So,
two hours later I check back and there's no activity on the server,
no RPMs have been updated, and the RHN website reports that it
had no problems updating my machine.

I've tried running up2date on the command line with -v for more
verbose output, which it doesn't produce.  I've also tried
just downloading RPMs, which it won't download.

Has anyone out there tried this and succeeded?  

Colin

One annoying aspect is that when running up2date from CLI, you must pass
it a switch, -u in order for it to actually follow through with the
updating of your system.
I assume you've already learned the --nox switch, which doesn't fire up
the gui front end?  Try up2date --help for more examples.  The --configure
switch should let you specify which packages to skip (kernel is by default
skipped).

> Has anyone out there tried this and succeeded?

Yes, up2date works great for me.

Hope this helps!

so you're saying the answer is:

up2date --nox --update

I've tried so many combinations that I'm sure I tried that, but I'll
give it a shot when I get home.

But Ed, the administrator can not force Microsoft to produce any
security fixes. In fact, even discussing vulnerabilities in that OS
could force one to fall prey to DMCA heart-ache, head-ache and possible
prosecution. Just as a vague example of the attitude that those
unfortunate individuals have to deal with, read the EULA (quite the
fancy acronym for End-User License Agreement) for the Microsoft .NET
Framework - it clearly states that by accepting this License Agreement
you will NOT discuss any benchmark findings with .NET to anyone without
the express written consent of Microsoft (I ran into that one over the
weekend while setting up my dual boot workstation). With an arrogant,
publish only the good, attitude like this, would it be possible that the
opinion of an administrator is going to make a difference when the CFOs
of the world just keep signing checks for more Windows? I'm sorry, I
think not.

In theory I really do agree with you, a lame Linux admin can create a
security nightmare much larger than one likely to come from a well cared
for Windows box. However, until Balmer and his marketing machine start
hearing it from the money source there will be no change in the product.

Just my opinion, and like Mr. Miller, I could be wrong.

While learning C, I ran this exercise designed to demonstrate floating point
rounding errors. You run a program that adds two float numbers. The book said
the output would be one of the following, depending on your system;

1. gcc / Linux  =    0.00000
2. Turbo C 1.5  =    -13584010575872.000000
3. CodeWarrior 5.0, MSVC++ 6.0  =  4008175468544.000000

On my system, (Compaq PII, Redhat 8.0, gcc version 3.2), the out put was exactly
that for the "CodeWarrior" listed above.  Questions is, why that output instead
of the gcc / Linux output?

And for a really cool way to update your RPMs, without using redhats stuff, 
try autorpm. Since Kirk issued the 3.0 series, it's a whole lot better. I 
run it in unattended mode for a few servers, and it just works.

I also use his logwatch script, and that works great too.

It's hard to say without seeing the code.

Perhaps they were using a much older version of gcc and the newer one is
doing something better (or maybe worse, again, hard to say without seeing
what you're trying to do...)

This might prove to be a fascinating conversation. There is not really
enough information to make even an educated guess on the subject so lets
start with the revisions of the compilers (gcc / linux 2.xx??) and the
processor architecture (is this 64 bit precision math on an ix86 vs. 64
bit precision on a SPARC or Alpha etc...)?  Some detail please.

I read comments like this (mostly on this list) all the time and I have to
wonder if there is some OTHER software called MPlayer that is "a bear to
install".

I remember some early version that had a build error in some video output
function or other, but that was like two years ago.

I built a new MPlayer just after New Year's Day and it was just a matter
of ./configure --help, picking out the options I needed, running
configure, then make, then make install.  I also downloaded some big fancy
new set of (unfortunately binary) codecs and added them to the group in
/usr/lib/win32/ and now I can play just about anything.

Oh, I also put in the mga_vid kernel module they distribute because it
makes things so fast and pretty with my G400 (though it's a pain that the
backend scaler isn't available on the second head).

But anyway, MPlayer builds cleanly and just works.  You kinda gotta watch
the configure output to make sure all the options you want are going to be
compiled in based on the libraries you have available and everything, but
it's not like it asks for anything unreasonable.

Oppose this with, say, ogg vorbis which I've NEVER had build cleanly on
any system without serious tweaking and hacking.

"There are more security alerts for Linux than there are for Windows."

"If Linux were as popular as Windows, it would have just as many security

Doesn't the first statement make the second statement mean that
Linux-based systems will have FEWER security problems when they are on as
many machines as Windows?

It depends, are "alerts" (first sentence) different than "problems"
(second sentence)?

Do "problems" mean it was too late -- whereas "alerts" indicate things are
recognized and dealt with relatively quickly?

Here is more info on the situation.

Compiler; gcc version 3.2 20020903
Kernel;   2.4.18-14 (Redhat 8.0)
Hardware; P4 (Thinkpad, NOT the Compaq box)
Preprocessor architecture; I don't know for sure if what I am attempting to
do is 64-bit precision math or not - remember, I'm the perpetual newbie here.


Code;
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
   float a, b;
   
   b = 2.0e20 + 1.0;
   a = b - 2.0e20;
   printf("%f \n", a);
   return 0;
}

The output is supposed to reflect the fact that the computer doesn't keep track
of enough decimal places to do the operation correctly. That's all well and
good, but then the book goes on to say that the output will be one of the following,
and my output matches exactly that of the "CodeWarrior;

gcc, Linux;   0.000000
Turbo C 1.5;  -13584010575872.000000
CodeWarrior;  4008175468544.000000

Incidentally, when I try to open vi to view the source file I get the following
message;

E325: ATTENTION
Found a swap file by the name ".floaterr.c.swap" while opening file "floaterr.c"


1. Another program may be editing the same file.....
2. An edit session for this file crashed. If this is the case, use ":recover"
or............"

I searched on rpmfind and pulled the src RPM backwith.  (Advise on the 
mplayer site and friends suggested there could be problems with library 
version unless compiled on the machine it was going to run on.)  Between 
14-16 hour days and a lack of attention I missed the real problem with the 
rebuild - the /usr/local/man/man1 directory didn't exist - but a few days 
later I took the time to look at the output.  5-10 minutes later I had 
mplayer installed.

Made the mistake of placing them in the mplayer library directory.  A
quick link and I was watching everything I could find and wanted to
download for free.

In addition, neither statement says anything about fixing what causes the 
"alert" or "problem".

Folks who depend on MS for fixes may think it's normal for an issue to go 
six months before a fix comes out.

Me too - now.

I started out in the Linux world with RedHat 6.0... then 6.2... then
Mandrake 7.0... then 7.2... and I could hardly ever get anything to
compile.  I was *sure* compiling things in Linux required you go in and
mess with the source code - way far over my head... I thought only true
Gurus and Developers compiled their own programs in Linux.

Then kernel 2.4.x wouldn't work for me on my hardware - it crashed and
burned the way it was compiled with everybody.  So I ended up trying
Slackware... I can't think of anything I was unable to get to compile
under Slackware 8.0 or 8.1 or my now 9.0-early-beta.  I also tried
Debian to build an LFS box - it also worked well at compiling
everything.  Now I'm playing around with Gentoo - it also compiles
everything.

Read into that what you will - it seems to me RH and Mandrake's setups
lead to problems building things from scratch.

I have a few GCC versions here I can throw at it....

GCC 3.2.0 - 4008175468544.000000 
GCC 3.2.1 - 4008175468544.000000 
GCC 2.96  - 4008175468544.000000
GCC 2.95  - 4008175468544.000000

Those are all against glibc 2.2.5, the top one being from my 9.0-beta
box, the bottom three are from my Slack 8.1 system.  They are all Athlon
boxes, but that shouldn't make any difference compiler-wise as there are
no CFLAGS involved - I might as well be compiling on an i386.

Just tossing more info at ya,
Rob

In many cases I've been notified about a patch for some package I have 
on Linux even though there isn't some virus or other things going 
around the internet exploiting the problem. With Windows it seems like 
in many cases we don't find out about an exploit until all hell breaks 
loose.

I would have to interject that *nix has been running for 30 years in a 
networked enviornment.  As such it has been looked at from a security 
point of veiw from the get go.  Microsoft on the other hand is a johnny 
come lately to networking and had no clue when designing the OS.  As 
such, they just now are finding out what security is.

Rob,

  FWIW, I've run only Red Hat since 4.0 or 4.1 (I forget which one) and have
compiled every kernel version but one (when I used the rpm to install it)
without a single problem. A couple of times I didn't have necessary
libraries when I tried building an end-user application from the source
tarball, but that was easily fixed. Once I remembered to run ldconfig again,
of course. :-) If it matters, I'm running on "antique" hardware: PII/333MHz
cpu with 328M RAM and an 8M vRAM nVidia 128 video card on one box and a
PII/500MHz with 128M RAM on the other, plus a new video card because the old
one died.

  My Slackware-8.1 disk set arrived yesterday and I'll be installing that on
my notebook Real Soon Now. This Toshiba Portege CT-3025 has a
Pentium-MMX/300 MHz cpu and 96M RAM. It's been running RH 6.2 and xfce just
fine.

  I'm not suggesting that your problems were not real, just that my
experience with Red Hat and building from source has been much more
favorable than trying to install some packages. As a matter of fact, when I
enter Dependency Hell with the rpms I'll often grab the tarball and run
'configure; make; make install' while I go work on something else.

When this message first posted, I almost fired back a VERY capitalized 
'Amen!' 

: I read comments like this (mostly on this list) all the time and I have to
: wonder if there is some OTHER software called MPlayer that is "a bear to
: install"

No, your setting for 'EZ install - just plop-n-go' is out of calibration.

A) But anyway, MPlayer builds cleanly and just works.
B) You kinda gotta watch the configure output to make sure all the options 
you want are going to be compiled in based on the libraries you have 
available and everything, but it's not like it asks for anything unreasonable.

Umm, statements (A) and (B) contradict each other.

Software that 'just works' installs with a single and simple action (a 
'familiar' word in a command shell, or a single action like a mouse-click) 
runs with a similarly simple one-hit. That's what the 'just' part means.

Let's say a user wants an 'AM Radio' program. First get a grip on the 
complexity of the task of operating a radio you can buy at Freddy's. Pretty 
much, not more than two controls: tuning and volume. Anything else starts 
getting geeky-tweeky, and isn't really necessary (timed auto-shutoffs, 
radio-on alarm mode, etc.)

So, you buy the radio, insert batteries, click 'On,' slide the volume to the 
middle, (because you didn't read the directions or look at the knob to know 
which way is LOUD - you select a mid-point expressly to avoid all these 
steps) and slide the tuner around. At this point, based on what you hear, you 
will make a decision about whether the device 'just works' or not.

Very few people buy a radio in order to learn about how amplitude modulation 
works They buy it to hear what the radio stations are playing. Same thing 
goes for the initial user in this thread. She need to learn about medicine, 
and doesn't have the bandwith to learn about that AND scalable 
back-whatchamacallits simultaneously.

So if you have a radio program, if it installs with a double-click on an RPM, 
and no other configurations are necessary, and it runs on my system and 
yours, THEN it's a 'normal, easy, simple install.' If you have to go to 
another website and figure out what else to install and where to put it, AND 
if you don't get it right then NOTHING happens, well, that's called 'a bear 
to install.' Or worse.

Remember, "builds cleanly and just works" contradicts "You kinda gotta watch."

And Jeme will now tell you that anyone that doesn't grok the output of make 
after compiling shouldn't be using a computer. They should be using a 
single purpose appliance.... :/

Or, at least, that's what he told me when I told him about users and how 
they don't want to know how to compile.

Oh please Rich...Your hardware is light years ahead of one of my old 
"antique" systems. I have a 5+ year old AMD K6/300 system with a measly 
64MB of memory. The mobo has on board video that uses a portion of the 
main memory for video memory. The system has a PC/AT keyboard connector 
and uses an AT power supply. 

I bet your PII has an ATX power supply and a PS/2 keyboard connector at 
least. :) I don't run X-windows on the system but it's great with only 
command line stuff which is all I need since I use it as a server. I've 
also built many versions of Linux on the thing over the years.

Does anyone besides me think that building software and using software 
are two **completely different** things?

It's one thing to buy a radio from a retail outlet, and something else 
entirely to buy one from HeathKit.

The minute we start complaining that developers need to make sure 
their Makefiles are completely user friendly is the day that 
developers will flip us all the finger and go underground.

The minute you decide to build software from scratch, you toss "just 
works" out the window.

I'm not that ancient yet and even some 20 years ago I didn't see Unix 
systems in a networked environment that much. We mostly had 1200 bps 
serial connections to dumb terminals. Most of the Unix systems I used 
didn't even have ethernet and so we copied files and executed programs 
remotely between systems using UUCP with a modem. In some cases if the 
system's were in the same room we'd make our own NULL modem cables to 
connect the systems together. 

Anyone have a good history of Unix reference? I thought TCP/IP 
networking didn't show up in Unix until BSD 4.x in the early 80s. 
Certainly the work that went on through DARPA that led to TCP/IP goes 
way back though. I have an old "BSD 4.3 Unix" textbook and that's about 
the only reference I see to networking in the "History of Unix" 
chapter.

  Are they still around? I built my first ham radio receiver and transmitter

That's really a different issue. A source rpm has been packaged by 
someone who thinks s/he has been able to script the build process 
cleanly enough for it to "just work" elsewhere.

Even then, however, I'm not going to hold the package maintainer
completely responsible for dealing with someone who wants to build his
source rpm on a system that has none of the -devel packages installed.

TCP or serial doesn't matter.  the fact that multiple users had access 
makes it multi user/networked.  If one had a terminal one was trying to 
hack something.  Ask Richard Stallman.  Remember when they passworded 
his logins and he hacked his way around that?


Microsoft was made for a single user.  And even the users often  hack 
their own machines to death.

Yes, work that went on before TCP/IP helped contribute to it.
I recall a class that I taught in the late 1970s, where some
students and I were discussing the IP protocol. An associate
of mine worked on Internet protocols as far back as the fall
of 1969. It wasn't IP back then but lessons learned from
these ancient protocols, especially routing protocols,
influenced the design of IP and modern day routing protocols.

That's EXACTLY what I was trying to tell Jeme.

Exactly, but you still don't need to know how AM works to build a HeathKit. 
All you really need to be able to do is follow instructions and be able to 
use a soldering iron.

Thank you for validating my feeling on this.

Um, what did the dumb terminals connect to, and what OS was THAT computer 
running?

I'd bet it was some form of Unix.

In my case you would lose the bet.

The PICK os ran on dumb terminals at 9600 baud (or slower) using 
unshielded lines in most cases.  They did not move to Unix until the early 
90s.

The first dumb terminals I used were on a Honeywell mainframe at the 
University of Alaska.  That system was running a Honeywell proprietary OS. 
(Back in the mid 70s.)  They started on cards and moved to DecWriters and 
VT-102s.

Yes it was Unix but the terminals were hardwired to the system. Later on 
I saw things like terminal servers that we dialed into and that let us 
go to whatever system we specified. That was done with a network in 
place since many of the systems were in different buildings etc.

But that's the point. Windows administrators can't solve many
of the security problems. It's beyond their control.If company
management insists that they do, they'll be forced to search
for better solutions and tell management that changes must occur
if their demands are to be met. As it is now, most Windows
administrators are silent co-conspirators.

It should not make a difference, but try:

up2date -u --nox

Does the machine give you any grief about being registered with RHN?  I
know that can be a pain.  Try deleting the machine profile from RHN's
web-based interface and perhaps it will re-register and kick things into
gear.

Message-ID: <200302042155.h14LtEf21214@gate.daniloff.com>

Hello Linux folks,
As most of you have suggested I've purchased
CrossOver Office Plugin for Linux and installed it.
However, every time I open web page in Mozilla 
browser, it plays QuickTime video stream but 
the sound is rippled.
It sounds like: Squick Squick Squick Squick ... 
with a very high pitch and frequency.
I'm using SuSE 8.1 with plain 2.4.19 kernel and ALSA modules
compiled separately. My desktop env. is KDE 3.1
If I'm using Mozilla and Noatun to watch mpg movies it works OK.
So, I conclude that the sound server works. 
Could somebody please give me a hint what should be checked/changed
to make sound work properly with Mozilla and QuickTime plugins.

Many thanks in advance.
Alex

I'll try that, too.  Right now everyone in the world is downloading the
new kernel that Red Hat just released, so being a non-subscriber it's
telling me that it's too busy.

I'll try later tonight.  I wanted to change the email address that it's

Was that Honeywell system, "Multics"? Many consider that a precursor to 
Unix, or at least as having a major influence on Unix design.

So what's the difference between a hard wired system, and one that you dial 
into? You connect through a serial port in both instances. The only 
difference I see is that you have a telephone company in the middle of the 
wire.

I am, of course, speaking logically, not physically.

I don't.  Let me (briefly) explain why.

The configure portion of the install process is not the same as the build
portion.  Once the Makefiles have been generated, the software builds
cleanly and just works.  However, making sure you're building the software
with the right options to do what you want to do requires ATTENTION.
It's not hard work.  You just watch the configure output go by and when it
says "DVD Navigation Disabled" you go "whoops!" and run ./configure --help
again and see that you should have appended --enable-dvdnav.  It's really
not rocket science or anything.  And when you actually run make, it just
works.  That's not the case with everything.

Now, I also think it's a GOOD THING that MPlayer doesn't enable everything
by default.  It's a big piece of software with lots of components and some
people may not want all that crud on their system (I wouldn't compile in
the DVD features if I didn't have a DVD ROM, for example).  So it makes
sense that you have to find the right options and enable them.  And I
don't see a functional difference between clicking a checkbox and typing
"--enable-foo".

I think `make all install` is pretty simple and familiar.  The
configuration takes a bit of attention, but if you're not going to pay
attention to what your software is doing, you're openning yourself up to
every kind of trojan and bug on Earth.

You had to LEARN all of this at some point.  It's deeply ingrained now and
something of a cultural feature.  One might also make some argument about
the "collective unconscious".  You know how it was a running joke for most
of the eighties and nineties that you had to get your kid to program your
VCR?  The difference is the cultural queues and development rates.  Now,
most people have it figured out and the people that don't have given up or
gotten too old to care.

You don't need to know anything about backend scalers to watch videos or
even to make MPlayer do whatever you want it to do.  Just like you don't
need to know everything about the endocrine system to know what happens
when you snort cocaine.

I mean, I don't know how HOW MPlayer works.  I don't have that level of
knowledge.  I mean, I know more than many and less than many.  I WISH I
knew more because it interests me, but that's one of the things that makes
me a geek; I have interest in details.

"Normal" is relative.  Hopefully you understand that.  (Or you end up like
George W. Bush preaching about Isaiah and going "home" with "the creator"
in a eulogy for a group that included at least one hindu and one
buddhist.)

For me, a "normal, easy, simple install" is `make all install`.  The
"./configure" part is part of figuring what software I'd like installed,
what I would like it to do, and how I would like to use it.  When you use
binary installations with preconfigured options (both compile-time and
run-time options like config files), you are submitting yourself to the
decisions of other people and taking a very passive role in the way you go
about doing the things you want to do.

You are trying to impose your ignorance on me and I won't have it.  We
have a different concept of what "a bear to install" means and you just
want to tell me that you're right and I'm wrong.  I reject that method of
thinking outright.

I do have an idea of what "a bear to install" means and it's related to
things that generate improper Makefiles, do not provide enough information
in their configure scripts or documentation to enable all of the options,
or require legal entanglements that prevent me from doing everything I can
to improve the lives of others.  So that doesn't jive with your
definition.  So what?

If you want to avoid "bears", I'm showing you another way to approach the
problem where the bears rarely come up.

> Remember, "builds cleanly and just works" contradicts "You kinda gotta

Not if you're watching something other than the build, silly.

How many layers of misconception can you find in the above sentences?

I was writing about the output of a configure script, not make.  Those are
two totally different things that require two different (but not mutually
exclusive) knowledge sets.

> Or, at least, that's what he told me when I told him about users and how
> they don't want to know how to compile.

Again, you're mistaken and simply carried your misconception through the
discussion while ignoring the actual argument.

I tried to express to you the idea that people who didn't have a fair
understanding of how software works (which is all you need to build
software) shouldn't be MANAGING computers.  You don't need more than very
basic knowledge to USE a computer.  And if your computer doesn't have an
administrator to manage the system, then you should probably ditch it and
get an appliance.

Your radio doesn't require an administrator because it IS an appliance.  A
PC is not an appliance.  It's a multi-functioning general purpose
computing device.  You can turn it into an appliance by installing some
kind of kiosk software, but the whole thing would be faster if you just
got a device with the kiosk software in ROM and only had the hardware
supported by the kiosk functionality.

Ignorant people shouldn't administer PCs just as ignorant people shouldn't
go mucking around inside their televisions, radios or even toasters.

And every system should be devised to protect itself from ignorant USERS.
Unix does this with file permissions.  Some devices do this with
tamper-proof seals and others do it with warning labels.  When we become
educated, we figure out how to alter our file permissions, open
tamper-proof seals and recognize the true dangers expressed in warning
labels.

A user doesn't configure and install system software just as a user
doesn't convert a VCR from NTSC to PAL.

I agree completely.  That's why we need to encourage people either become
or find competent administrators for their general purpose computer
systems.

No, you just change your definition of "just works".

Social norms (which "easy" and "just works" really are) are defined by the
group with which you identify.  When you decide to build software from
scratch, you move from "user" to "administrator" and the definitions
change.

I think someone else brought this up, but if you didn't have to get up and
go over to the computer to use it, it was networked.

More (correctly and) to the point, it isn't really the network that adds
the security risks, but the multi-user expectations and capabilities of
the system.  Unix was designed for many people to use and processes run by
different users or by the "services" provided therein.  Windows was
designed <*cough*> to be used by one person sitting at the console running
every single process for local output.

This is a crucial difference when considering security.

yes, that's not the point.  the point is the difference
between undef and '' and '0' and 0 is important.  if someone
doesn't know why the two loops are not identical, then I'd
be wary of their understanding of Perl booleans in general.
there are way too many cargo-cult programmers out there.

yes, I'm being pedantic.  there's a normal tension between

Not to fan the flames but...

It's been said that if you can play solitaire you're a Windows Network Admin.

It seems that Unix/Linux admins are more capable and do a better job of 
managing security.

How much is due to the admin's skills and how much is due to the operating 
system?

It's a synergy. Linux (and Unix) provides the security
mechanisms but it's up to an administrator to intelligently
use them. It was/is the same way with NetWare. There's little
benefit unless administrator intelligence is applied.

pre-Internet, there were still email and online chat
programs on Unix systems, with their own security problems.
one I remember: many terminals are "smart", and with the
right escape sequences you can a) change the terminal's
"answerback" string, b) tell the terminal to send the
answerback string.  so someone using a naive email program
could read an email message that would cause their terminal
to execute, say, "rm -rf *".  this bug was killed a couple
decades ago, though it might have modern versions.

I have seen management actually tell the MS reps that they intended to
spend IT dollars elsewhere, citing the fact that the product was not
worth the price anymore. That strategy sent a very clear signal to MS,
once that they realized we were serious, and the negotiation started
followed by a genuine effort to fix any existing problems that we had.

Microsoft's development teams actually have the ability to deliver
quality, I don't think that anyone would dispute that, unfortunately
their management and marketing machine lacks the motivation to allow the
basic fundamental changes necessary to implement quality and security.
This situation corrects itself a little more with every customer that
tells MS that they intend to move to a competitor.

All in all, it's really not complaints that Microsoft lacks (threads
like this one happen daily and globally). I feel that the solution rests
firmly on the shoulders of IT decision makers - when they make a
conscious decision to use non-MS products, thus stopping the constant
flow of cash, Microsoft will solve the problem very quickly.

Actually, s370 and prior - grandfather to S390, and now z/OS.  IBM's
been building mainframe systems for a very long time without the aid of
*nix (but they are supporting it now on that hardware - a very good
thing for folks like us).

I don't think the question was "What is the solution to Microsoft's
security problems?", but rather, "What is the solution to showing people
that Linux-based and other Unix-like systems are less susceptible to virii
and usually more secure?"

Maybe I misread, but I don't think the problem of Microsoft's security
methods are all that relevant to most of us (except insofar as protocols
get broken and become unusable due to something Microsoft botched either
on purpose or by blunder).

I don't think that you misread the question at all. I interpreted the
thread to be a discussion on what is the solution to putting pressure on
MS to correct some of the problems that their plague their OSes. Was
that the wrong impression?

I really don't believe that the Engineers at MS intentionally produce
code that breaks. Not sure if you remember or not but every MS OS from
Win95 and to current had a hard-coded release date that was set by MS
Marketing (we all know that this normally happens with a dart board and
not through feasibility study). Perhaps this little snip from RFC1925
would help them in the future.

  (2)  No matter how hard you push and no matter what the priority,
       you can't increase the speed of light.

       (2a) (corollary). No matter how hard you try, you can't make a
            baby in much less than 9 months. Trying to speed this up
            *might* make it slower, but it won't make it happen any
            quicker.

Since I asked the original question I'll interpret it.
I'd prefer that the issue of Microsoft's security problems
is solved by replacing Microsoft's products with those that
were designed to be secure from the start. Why reward
a monopolist that's responsible for the horrid state of
computing and for breaking the law. Jeme can argue the latter
point.

My son is selling his game boay advance on ebay. I'm hosting the picures on my server, because I'm cheap and 
nothing sells like photographs. (except touch, bu apache doesn't do that yet)

I'm wanting to do a little specialized analysis of my log files. I want to know how many looks at the files 
with "/gba/" AND "_small.jpg" and how many looked at the files that were only "/gba/" this will tell me how 
many clicked on the link for a much larger image to really check out his item. Part of the problem is that 
there are other entries in the log that have "_small.jpg" in them.

I'm using egrep like this:
egrep -c "/gba/" /var/log/httpd/access_log
THis gives me half of what I want.

I've tried:
egrep -c "/gba/|_small" /var/log/httpd/access_log
but it gives me an EITHER search, not what I wanted. I cannot find an AND in the man page, maybe because it's 
too simple to specify.

Is there a character for this, or will egrep even do this?

I share a dialup connection with another non-linux user. The modem is
on one of my linux boxen, but the other user is connected on the local
ethernet. I'd like a way to limit his use of the available bandwidth
when I'm trying to do work. He tends to do wget sequences while he's
sleeping, which is when I'm up. His equipment is not handy to me, so I
can't simply pause the process on his desktop. I'd like some toggle
that I can set on my system that limits his thruput so that I can get
useful thruput of my own. The honor system doesn't seem to be working
these days.

Any ideas on where to start?

Thanx!

egrep -c "/gba/.*_small.jpg" /var/log/httpd/access_log 

should work, but I'm no grep master. The idea is that you are grepping
for /gba/ followed by some set of characters (.* the "." usually means
any one char. the "*" means any number of times) followed by the
string _small.jpg.

This did what I expected on a test example I had laying arround, if
you wanted to do a true AND, you would need something more
complex.. but I'm guessing the /gba/ always comes before the
_small.jpg

I think hte post above is a cleaner solution, but the code below can
be condensed:

grep gba /var/log/httpd/access_log | grep _small.jpg | wc

The first # output by wc is the line count (the number of lines that
matched both greps)

pipeing grep to grep is an invaluable tool for searching code, btw. 

find . -name "*.lisp" | xargs grep -in <function_name> 

if that floods your screen,

!! | grep -i "def"

and you have the file, line # and function prototype..

So, would this find gba and eliminate the small and 132 lines?

grep gba /var/log/httpd/access_log | grep  -v _small.jpg | -v grep 132 | wc

Yep. or you could probably combine the lat two greps into 

egrep -v "_small.jpg|132"

(use deMorgan's Law)

So these outputs match mine exactly -- thanks for the experiment. At this point
it looks like the book I'm reading on C has mistakenly flipflopped the outputs
from CodeWarrior and Linux / gcc.

I apologize to you and the group, I had you confused with Randall
Schwartz.

The subject and the nature of the question is what I thought it was and
the solution of just not buying the MS products, but instead purchasing
something else should work. That is starting to happen in Governments
all over the world now, take a look at Germany - they have mandated that
all levels of Government will use Linux citing the problems that MS has
dealing with security issues.

If you haven't seen this it's worth a look,

You can use a couple of simple greps piped together.
For both:

grep "/gba/" /var/log/httpd/access_log | grep "_small.jpg" | wc

And for the other case:

grep "/gba/" /var/log/httpd/access_log | grep -v "_small.jpg" | wc

Hi all,
It has been requested by powers on high to find out the following email
counts and size:
    received from out side
    received internal
    sent to out side
    sent internal
The only command that I have found is 'mailstats'
This program seems to reset the counters every time you run it?
The following is a copy of the output
Statistics from Wed Feb  5 00:00:01 2003
 M   msgsfr  bytes_from   msgsto    bytes_to  msgsrej msgsdis  Mailer

Am I correct that the mail box generated 686 messages?  Why?  I get
about 6 cron email's a week and that should be all.

We have a RH 8.0 pop3 system.  Any idea's on how to gather the above
information?

As someone else whose name also concludes with l's, and who shares an
inordinate sensitivity to using the correct number, I'll just point
out here that Randal's name concludes with one.  My own, for the
record, concludes with two.  All the other Russell's on this mailing
list do too, though I cannot speak for the inordinance of their
sensitivity.

Thanks.

Subject: [PLUG] configuring mutt for html mail
Message-ID: <20030205123324.A31512@tpol.peak.org>

I'm trying to switch from pine to mutt, but can't get mutt to handle
incomming html mail the way pine does -- which is basically to display
it as if it were plain text.  I've set up my .mailcap file with this line:

text/html;lynx %s; copiousoutput

and in .muttrc have 

auto_view text/html

but when I try to open mail that's text/html I see a permanent message
at the bottom of mutt's display like this:

Invoking autoview command: lynx '/tmp/mutt4534'

I have to ^C to get out of that state, and then get a screen full of
raw html.

Does anybody have this working?  Any tips?  I've found plenty of sites
via google that claim it does work but none with info beyond what I've
set up in my .muttrc and .mailcap.

Versions: mutt: 1.2.5i; lynx 2.8.4dev16

Thanks,

--Eric House

I've put this in my .mailcap:

text/html; lynx -force_html %s; needsterminal;

and didn't change my .muttrc.
It works, in that I can read the html, but I have to view the 
attachments in order to see it.

Mutt 1.2.5.1i

I have the same auto_view line and I'm using this in my mailcap:

text/html; links -dump %s; nametemplate=%s.html; copiousoutput

as suggested by the mutt manual at mutt.org, and it works fine in mutt
1.4. I don't have mutt 1.2.5.1 anywhere to test with.

I don't knowhow to tweak configurations or set up users under the new redhat-ized 
version of squirrelmail.

There was a script in the old version you could run to do lots of cool stuff, but 
it's gone and I can't find out how to do it without the old way (the story of my 
life)

Any pointers to a new Xconfigurator or netcfg type tool (they're gone, too)?? 
There's no man squirrelmail, no redhat-config-squirrelmail, nothing, nada that I can 
find. The required google searches leave me wanting.

It didn't seem particularly redhat-ized when I was working with it on a
friend's computer yesterday.... although there is always a chance he
dropped the RPM version in favor of just downloading it from the SM
webpage (as I would suggest you do, if you have problems).

There was a configure script in the main squirrelmail directory that
handled most of the setup.

It authenticates with your main system as far as I know, so if you want
to add users, just add them to your system and you should be good to go.

I'd be looking at:

/etc/httpd/conf.d/squirrelmail.conf
/etc/squirrelmail/config.php
/usr/share/squirrelmail/config/conf.pl

I think the last one is the missing configure script you are looking for.

Since we're setting records straight, my first legally concludes with 2,
but unofficially and in common use 1, and on some occasions, has been
known to grow to 3 or 4.

rpm lets you query for documentation (assuming the packager designated 
it with a %doc macro):

  rpm -qd squirrelmail

rpm -qd , very nice. This is my attempt to make this easy for me to use. Any
ideas on  how to make the menu more managable when the script finds a lot of
documents? 


#!/bin/sh

if [ $1 ] ; then
	WTHIT=$1
else
	echo "usage: $0 pattern"
	exit 1
fi
let x=0
for i in `rpm -qa | grep $WTHIT` ; do
	DOC=`rpm -qd $i`
	if [ x = 0 ] ; then
		DOCS="$DOC"
		let x=1
	else
		DOCS="$DOCS $DOC"
	fi  
done
PS3="Please select the menu number for the resource you wish to view #"
select RESOURCE in $DOCS ; do
	if [ $RESOURCE ] ; then 
		if [ `echo $RESOURCE | grep man` ] ; then
			man $RESOURCE
			exit 0
		elif [ `echo $RESOURCE | tr [:upper:] [:lower:] | grep html` ]
; then
			links -g $RESOURCE
			exit 0	
		elif [ $RESOURCE ] ; then
			less $RESOURCE
			exit 0
		fi
	else	
		echo "Invalid Selection"
	fi
done
exit 0


I like links 2.1 instead of lynx but either should work. 


Thank you

Not sure about Squirrelmail, but the replacement for
Xconfigurator is twofold:

  redhat-config-xfree86

This will set up X, but the catch is, it needs a
rudimentary X to run.

To set up a basix X configuration so you can run
redhat-config-xfree86:

  xf86config

I hope in 8.1 they smooth out this process.

Yep, put this in your .mailcap instead:

text/html; lynx -dump -force-html %s; copiousoutput nametemplate=%s.html

I like to use the links browser instead of lynx. It
does a better job with tables and layout. So in
.mailcap I have

text/html;      links %s; nametemplate=%s.html

icc, the Intel compiler (at least ver. 6.0; I haven't used 7.0) will
indeed compile C code.

You can get a free noncommercial-use license just by asking Intel.  
There are some restrictions that come with the free license, e.g.,

  If you are using the Materials under the control of a
  Noncommercial-Use license, you as an individual may use the 
  Materials for only personal, noncommercial and research purposes.  
  The Materials may not be used fo r any other purpose, whether "for
  profit" or "not for profit."  Any work perform ed or produced as a
  result of use of the Materials cannot be performed or produc ed for
  the benefit of other parties for a fee, compensation or any other
  reimbur sement or remuneration.

I've never done any performance testing of the binaries it produces,
though they seem to behave well. Assuming your output is dynamically
linked, it will have a dependency on one or more of the Intel runtime
libaries.

Does this means that if I wrote a dynamically-linked GPL program
with Intel's compiler I'd be able to distribute the libraries?

Yep. You may redistribute the libraries, unless you're using the
'Evaluation License,' in which case you can't do much of anything
besides evaluate the product. Here's the legalese:

    Redistributables: include header, library, and dynamically 
    linkable library files. You may copy and distribute (except under
    an Evaluation License) the Redistributables, or any portions
    thereof, as part of the product you developed using the Developer
    Tools.

    ...

    The Materials defined as Redistributables are the following files: 

    libcprts.so.1
    libcprts.so
    libcxa.so.1
    libcxa.so
    libguide.so
    libunwind.so.1
    libunwind.so.2
    libunwind.so

Thanks, Paul. I find their 30% speed improvement interesting.
I'm also wondering whether statically-linking with their
compiler produces executables that are as large as with
gcc and GNU libraries.

Basically, I just installed icc 6.0 for a class out here at OGI, did
some basic testing to ensure that it produced usable binaries, wrote a
short help page detailing its use, and then ignored it. I really
haven't played with it beyond that.

Where could I get a 9 track tape drive in install on my Linux workstation?
Should be SCSI rather than Pertec interface.  Prefer cheap.  I'm poor at

6250 bpi.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0302061721570.7788-100000@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

What are the best tools (preferrably Linux) for reading and reformatting
data from strange internal formatted tapes?  I wrote some tools for
this at one time, but they were very specific and limited in their
abilities.  I also used a great (and very complex) tool called Forms in
the 1970s that ran on CDC Cybers; but haven't seen anything like it since.

I need to read a tape or part of a tape that was created on a Prime
computer using Magsav/Magrst.  I think they created the tape in about
1990.  I would hate to use dd and write C programs to convert the data,
but if need be ...

Does anyone know of anyone still running a Prime computer?
This is or was a supermini computer using a lovely (but dead)
operating system called Primos.  I'm especially interested in
finding a Prime with a nine track reel to reel tape drive.

BLM used to use Primes, but they removed their last one four
years ago.

There's a dead-tree type magazine called "The Processor" with a website
http://www.processor.com that somewhat resembles Computer Shopper from
a decade ago: it's got no articles -- just classified and
non-classified advertising. Fortunately, a subscription is free. The
ads they publish are mostly for midrange (ie. rackmount,
enterprise-class stuff) equipment, with some of it new and some used
stuff available. I think their website might also have a search engine.
I'll bet they have someone who will sell you a 9-track drive.

Words could not express my joy a few years ago when my manager decided
to migrate our tape library from 9-track to DAT! Those were the
days....


David asked:

Should be SCSI rather than Pertec interface.  Prefer cheap.  I'm poor
at
the moment.  Needs to read 2400' reel to reel 9 track tapes recorded at
6250 bpi.

Be warned that the compiler's quality is suboptimal at best. We have
several bug reports open with Intel against this compiler. With
optimization enabled, it can generate bad code very easilly, and it's damn
hard to find.

Message-ID: <20030207135248.40763.qmail@web20109.mail.yahoo.com>

I've installed a custom RedHat 8 server via the GUI on a machine with
very little HDD space, so I had to consider carefully each tool I might
want. I'm happy with the setup RedHat delivered for me.

I then proceded to screw around with settings and install programs that
I don't really want to have around in the long run. I have copied my
install.log and anaconda-ks.cfg files to a floppy disk. Is there some
way to use these as a script to reinstall the OS and my selected tools
without walking through twenty minutes worth of check-boxes?

I see from your follow-up message that you've got this straightened 
out, but since PLUG can never let a simple "it's working" statement go 
without comment...

Take a peek at the base/comps.xml file in your installation tree (on 
the CD or wherever). It's a big file, but you'll get the hang of it 
pretty quickly.

It'll tell you exactly what individual RPMs are associated with each
package group and whether those RPMs must be installed, are usually 
installed, or are optional (not usually installed). Here, for 
instance, is the package list for the 'Web Server' group:

  <packagelist>
    <packagereq type="mandatory">httpd</packagereq>
    <packagereq type="mandatory">httpd-manual</packagereq>
    <packagereq type="default">hwcrypto</packagereq>
    <packagereq type="default">mod_python</packagereq>
    <packagereq type="default">mod_perl</packagereq>
    <packagereq type="default">mod_ssl</packagereq>
    <packagereq type="default">php</packagereq>
    <packagereq type="default">php-imap</packagereq>
    <packagereq type="default">php-ldap</packagereq>
    <packagereq type="optional">php-pgsql</packagereq>
    <packagereq type="optional">mod_auth_pgsql</packagereq>
    <packagereq type="default">squid</packagereq>
    <packagereq type="default">tux</packagereq>
    <packagereq type="default">webalizer</packagereq>
  </packagelist>

The only packages you need to install are httpd (Apache) and its 
documentation. The ones marked 'default' are typically installed 
unless you say otherwise. The ones marked 'optional' are typically 
*not* installed unless you specify them.

If you're doing network installation of Red Hat, you can easily 
customize any existing group. If you don't think the Apache manual is 
all that necessary, then edit its entry:

  <packagereq type="optional">httpd-manual</packagereq>

Or you can create your own groups that contain non-default packages 
you want installed on all your systems. Here's a group I created for 
use at work:

  <group>
    <id>cfst-required</id>
    <uservisible>true</uservisible>
    <name>CFST Required</name>
    <description>
      A grouping of CFST-built packages and some Red Hat packages we 
      install by default on all Linux hosts.
    </description>
    <packagelist>
      <!-- required locally built rpms -->
      <packagereq type="default">cfengine</packagereq>
      <packagereq type="default">qr</packagereq>
      <!-- required red hat packages -->
      <packagereq type="default">chkconfig</packagereq>
      <packagereq type="default">mysql</packagereq>
      <packagereq type="default">ntp</packagereq>
      <packagereq type="default">perl-CGI</packagereq>
      <packagereq type="default">perl-DBD-MySQL</packagereq>
      <packagereq type="default">perl-DBI</packagereq>
      <packagereq type="default">perl-RPM2</packagereq>
      <packagereq type="default">perl-TermReadKey</packagereq>
      <packagereq type="default">rcs</packagereq>
    </packagelist>
  </group>

The 'CFST Required' package group shows up during the install process 
(if you're doing a manual installation) and can also be invoked during 
a kickstart installation. It installs some Red Hat packages that might 
not get installed otherwise, plus some locally built packages on 
which we rely[1].

I'm sure this is more than you wanted to know... :-)

--Paul Heinlein <heinlein at attbi.com>

[1] Actually, some more trickery is involved before a locally built 
    package can be grafted into the Red Hat installer, but it's not 
    that difficult.

I set up a Samba PDC on my little server-in-the-closet system a month or
two back Just Because I Could.  It seems to work as designed, although
I've never had the pleasure of playing with domains before.

It was all very very easy to set up.  I had Windows 98 and Windows 2000
boxes as members of the domain, and was able to authenticate with it on
a more temporary basis from XP Home... and also from XP Pro, although XP
Pro can be joined to the domain like all other versions of Windows
except XP Home.

Anyway, it works well.

But, I haven't tried to join a Windows 2000 *server* to the domain
before.  Did you want it to act as a backup PDC or something?  Samba is
limited in regards to how well it works with other domain controllers,
if I remember correctly.

Anyway... if you like, I can post my smb.conf file... I know how
daunting it can seem to try and write one from scratch.  Mine is
modified from one a friend gave me, so it's only fair I pass it along. 
:-)

We purchased our 9-track drive about 15 years ago because the mail
list houses would only accept 9-track media. We could fit our data
on a floppy but that was too cutting edge for them at the time.
Tapes were expensive compared to floppies so I purchased about 100
used tapes from a company in Boston. The tapes came complete with
company accounting data.

:  You just watch the configure output go by and when it
: says "DVD Navigation Disabled" you go "whoops!" and run ./configure --help
: again and see that you should have appended --enable-dvdnav. 

How easy is it to know that, (in your case) you should have 'appended' 
"--enable dvdnav"? This is where good feedback (telling the operator what's 
happenig in a language he can understand) is critical to usability. 

: Now, I also think it's a GOOD THING that MPlayer doesn't enable everything
: by default.  It's a big piece of software with lots of components and some
: people may not want all that crud on their system (I wouldn't compile in
: the DVD features if I didn't have a DVD ROM, for example).  So it makes
: sense that you have to find the right options and enable them. 

After reading this part, (and to offer something constructive to the whole 
list) 

: I think `make all install` is pretty simple and familiar. 

I never heard of 'make all install.' (I'm not setting myself up a s'the' 
reference standard, but it's also NOT in the indices of my:

Mandrake 8.0 "Installation and User Guide"
Mandrake 8.0 "Reference Manual"
Siever, "Linux in a Nutshell" (O'Reilly)
Cornes, "Linux A-Z" (Prentice Hall)
Welsh, Kaufmann "Runnin Linux" (O'Reilly)

This indicates that 'make all install' is far less well-known and certainly 
not explained in a quickly accessable fashion. (Remember we're -still- trying 
to wacth the movie, not read 5 books.)

OK - on to the constructive suggestions:

It occurs to me that, since (a) I'm not alone, and (b) WAL-MART has been 
selling Lindows machines for $199, that there will be a GROWING (read: 
"profitable?") market for simple CD's that implement simple 'appliance' 
programs FOR you.

How big is MPlayer when uncompressed and installed? A couple of megs?)
Next question: How much is the space for -all- the required dependent 
libraries for -all- the available functions? 100M tops? (I don't know - if my 
guesses are wrong please feel free to tweak the numbers.)

What I'm driving at is this: If the process of interrogating a machine and 
finding out what's there and what's not, PLUS writing a GUI to ask the user 
what he* wants and don't want (DVD? etc.) is -sooo- easy:

Then could a company be formed to prodice and market an 'MPLayer installer 
CD?' I'd pay $12 - $22 bux for it. 

The CD has - what - 650MB or more available? So, we should be able to write 
(in 400MB?) a program to help the user find and fix what's wrong.

What do you think? Can we do this? Does anybody want to? Gather seed money 
and do a website or product launch? I already have a company and a rented 
mailbox. Anyone interested?

Usually it's given as 
$ make
$ make install

in the 'INSTALL' doc from autoconf, often proceeded by './configure'. 
'all' is usually the default target by convention, but you probably
wouldn't get that from a beginner's book (or possibly by anything other
than looking at Makefiles...)

Message-ID: <1517.134.244.174.42.1044668013.squirrel@sautez.dhs.org>

Hello all,

I'm sure some of you have had this problem and can give me a nice trick to
find the computer.

I have a computer on the network doing NTP broadcast yet I can not find it.

I know the IP and I know that windows nbtstat doesn't respond.  This makes
me think that maybe it is some sort of linux box.  But I could be wrong.

Does anyone know how I would go about testing to see what type of machine
it is and how to find it?  I have no idea where it is in the building
either.

Thanks,

Josh

If you've got the IP address, you've also got the MAC address.  From
that, you can find a) The NIC manufacturer and b) The switch port
(assuming you're using switched Ethernet).

Will,

I do have a switch network but how do I get the switch port for MAC Address?

Thanks for the help.

It varies by vendor and I assume you have a managed switch.  I've done
it with 3Com and Cisco switches, but it's been so long I don't remember
exactly.

Reminds me of a story a year or so ago about a university bsd server that 
took IT a long time to locate.  They finally found it in a closet that had 
been walled up 10? years before.

google's coming up short here.

I remember that story and trying to not have that. :-)

It seems that there are place holders in the DNS and folks have used IP's
that they were not suppose to use.  HMM.  Anywho, I'll just go to the
switch and start pulling cables until my laptop stops responding to the
ping.  Then I'll waiting until the user of the computer complains.  That
way I'll know. :-)

I assume that your in a corporate environment so shotgunning the
problems like this could be disruptive and is unwise, especially if
there are older NT4 servers out there running things like Exchange.

What kind of switches are they and do you have administrative authority
over them?

I'm not too sure that you'll get favorable market study results on this.
The reason that I say this is because most source tarballs, and I have
not seen any that don't, come with at least a README or INSTALL document
in the source root. If you look in the source root of the latest MPlayer
tarball you'll find a README text file that includes step by step
installation procedures.

Yes, configure/make/make install  is more difficult than insert CD/click
Setup but I would encourage you to ask around and see if you can get a
feel for how many folks really hate to read an INSTALL document
(something that will have to be done regardless of the installation
method).

Yes it is a coorporate place.  I don't have control over the switches but
I have access to them.  I can get the login into them I believe on Monday.
 That guy is in another office.  But if I do this over the weekend I can
even goes so far as to figure out who it is.  But Since our sub-office is
pretty small I doubt it will effect anyone that much.  I have since left
the office so I can't tell you what type of switches.

If I did have access to them I still would only be able to find out which
port the computer is pulled into.  Then I would still have to go all
around the office checking every cube/room for a computer connected to
that port number provided that the labeling is correct. One of the reasons
I thought just unplugging it would be faster.  OH, and I'm lazy.  I'm sure
it is not an old exchange server or any "real" server.  We don't have
anything that important in our office anymore.  They moved those all very
far away.

If I had a way to tell what type of machine it was I could really narrow
down the problem really fast.  I can't seem to find a tool that would scan
all ports and give me a report on what type of machine.  I know it doesn't
have a web server running.  So that option is out.

If it's running buggy enough software, you can probably find a few O/S
exploits from the known sources, and then take it over and start
making it beep loudly. :)

On a more practical note, "sudo nmap -O i.p.ad.dr" will at least give
you an idea of O/S it's running.

nmap.

Did you try to connect to it via smb?

What is the problem with the computer doing the NTP (Network Time
Protocol?) broadcast in the first place, though?

And I think most configure scripts are pretty straightforward and usable
in that respect.  You get something like:
checking for dvd navigation.... No.

And when you run ./configure --help, you get some output line like
--enable-dvdnav        Enable dvd menu navigation

It's pretty straightforward.

As with most unix commands, there's lots of ways to phrase the same thing.
You might see it as `make; make install`, `make && make install` or merely
`make install`.

Also note that those references are for USERS rather than administrators
(and I don't think Mandrake probably goes through a lot of trouble to
distinguish between the two).

I think you'll find lots of information if you just look at make(1).
You'll see that "all" is the default paramter and parameters passed in
sequence are processed in the sequence they were passed.

Right.  As I wrote before, it is possible to turn a general purpose PC
into an appliance by installing some kind of kiosk software... preferably
on read-only media.

However, if you want a general purpose computer to remain a general
purpose computer, you're going to need an administrator to keep it running
smoothly and securely.

So we're looking at 20MB for the binary and all the dynamic libraries,
many of which are shared with dozens or hundreds of other executables.

It only interrogates for things that are either on by default or
specifically requested.  The default setting for each optional capability
is really up to the maintainer.  I prefer that optional things be turned
off until I enable them.  Some prefer the opposite.  There are good
arguments for both sides and you end up with, in practice, a mix.

I suppose people COULD do that, if they wanted to keep secrets for a
living.  After all, the entire business model here is to keep information
from people who do not pay and restrict those who do pay from sharing
information with others.  I find that entire concept unsavory.

I think you're trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist.

I think the real business opportunity is home system administration.
Show people that making a computer system work smoothly and securely
requires a trained individual that isn't present in most households.  I
think such a service could probably be provided to most households for
$20/month for the first pc and $10 for each thereafter with the
requirement that the household have a broadband connection and run some
remote administration software (sshd should be fine).

> *he/she - My copy of Strunk & White, 5th ed, says 'he' is usable here.

I personally believe that english has no male pronouns or, indeed,
specifically male words.  There are general words and feminine words.
Unfortunately, usage has made a mess of the whole thing and there are fine
literary examples of "they" in the singular for these occassions as well
as the argument (again, from example, but language is only "correct"
insofar as we understand each other) that either neutral or feminine
pronoun is usable in a hypothetical because the gender is also
hypothetical and the relevance of the gender is up to the reader to
deduce.

Subject: [PLUG] SuSE 64bit Power PC help needed.
Message-ID: <3E44834F.6070007@aracnet.com>

First of all no throwing things at me. I admit I don't eat, sleep and drink 
Linux. But, I've played with and have a Mandrake 8.1 system running here at 
home. I generally navigate/config via MidnightCommander, X or Webmin.

I have been asked to do some work on SuSE 64bit PowerPC setup remotely. Best I 
can tell the system is not much more than a default install with some small 
changes. I want to be able to use X remotely via both my linux box and a windows 
system. I've seen this done in the past but never needed to do it. Ialso will 
need some help getting sendmail to relay to and rcv mail from another server via 
smtp.

I did a quick browse of the SuSE install man but it's mainly just that. It 
assumes that you want to run X on a phyically attached monitor, mouse etc which 
I am not.

Thoughts? Comments? Hints on were to go ? (careful what you say, little ones may 
be reading this)

thanks

now you all got me excited about solving the issue.  I'm powering up the
laptop.

The problem started with it being misconfigured.  It is requesting an ntp
server that doesn't exist and others are asking me to stop it.  :-)  But
no one knows where it is actually sitting. So I'm looking.

okay. nmap returns:

23 and 80 open.  both not responding though.

says it is a VxWorks 5.3.x based System.  usually an ethernet hub or
switch or BayNetworks MicroAnnex XL Term Server.

Now I doubt the guy asking wouldn't know.

Oh, wait.  I think I know now.  I bet it is an old switch.  hmm.  I'll
send an email.  That would make sense.  I'll make the guy complaining fix
it.  Thanks for the help.

Still odd. because I would have thought that 23 or 80 would respond. 
Maybe open but not running a service.

Try to telnet from a box on the same local network segment as the suspect box
if you aren't on it, i.e. from another switch. To have a switch listening to
port 80 means the switch isn't that old. I'm not sure when web based management
became common, maybe after 1997, but it wasn't too long ago when a CLI and SNMP
were the only tools available. 

Thank you
Russell

According to people on the amavis-users list, 2.50 in CVS is supposed to
include Bayesian learning and notwithstanding the non-released status,
is supposed to be fairly stable.

Haven't used it, but it's mentioned in an article in the March 2003 Linux
Journal about the basis of Bayesian filtering techniques.  crm114 is
phrase-based instead of word based - this would seem to be a plus.

BTW: there's also an article in there about SpamBayes another Bayesian
spam filter.

On re-reading this, I realize I wasn't clear: SpamAssassin 2.50.

Hmmm, that makes a question occur to me; has everyone (who runs their own
mail server) tried Postfix's built-in anti-spam measures?
Since I switched to Postfix and turned on most (all?) of the features in
main.cf, I receive fewer than 1 spam per week.  I take that back, last
week I received two (down from 10-15 per day before Postfix).

Reviewing my nightly Postfix log summary, so far this week it's received
497 emails, and rejected 161 or 32% blocked for spam.  Of the options,
Spamcop's blacklist seems to block about 70% of the total rejects.

Because of these what I consider excellent results, I have not endeavored
at all to look at SpamAssassin.  My satisfaction is particularly keen in
knowing that the spam is not even received by my Postfix, even if later to
be zapped by SA or some other tool.

So my questions are- why aren't the blacklists used by Postfix & it's
other tools used more commonly?  Or is it simply the fact that my measly
497 messages per week volume is much smaller than most folk's (including
less spam)?  Is it simply that most people don't run their own mail
server?

That reminds me of another SpamCop question.  I paid their $25 for a
"reporting" account, which gives me 25MB of spams for them to process (I
report the few spams I still get dutifully).  It isn't clear to me if/how
this contributes to the blacklist.  Do they take the combined complaints
against a mail server, and after a threshold add it to the blacklist?  Or
did that just get me only the "reporting" service?  Quite frankly, I don't
much care if the network admins get notified about their spammers, I'm
quite sure they don't care.  I just want to help feed the blacklist.  It
seems that querying their blacklist server via Postfix is free.  That's
where I would like my money to go- perhaps it did when I sent the $25.

Interested to hear other's results in blocking spam.

  Me! That's why I set up the MTA here.

  The highest daily report was a couple of days ago: 485 messages received,
87 rejected. Still, about 4 slipped past the guards at the gate.

Whenever you report spam to Spamcop the IP addresses from the spam are used to 
make up the Spamcop DNSBL. After a certain number complaints about a 
particular IP it's added to the list and then drops off in something like 
seven days unless there are more complaints.

I'm getting about the same results as you--the Spamcop list is responsible for 
70-80 percent of my spam rejects.

The fact it pulls up the docs is pretty tame but pulling the documents out of

Nope. A lot of spammers forge their mail as being from hotmail, yahoo or AOL 
but Spamcop only looks at the actual IP address that connected to your mail 
server. Whatever spammers use as a return address or forged HELO or whatever 
isn't taken into account--only the connecting IP address.

I might add- most of my extended family uses AOL, and I've never had
Postfix incorrectly reject an email from them.  The only thing it
sometimes rejects is fqdn and other DNS-related problems, and it is easy
to configure PF to not reject that.  Sometimes public mail adminstrators
assign a RFC1918 address to the "public" hostname of their mx record or
some such nonsense.  When there is an inconsistency Postfix will reject-
but it's relatively easy to see in the logs when it happens.

But that may be because Spamcop is the first RBL that's being
checked. Whichever RBL I put first in my list tends to
suppress the most spam.

My results are a little interesting, although similar. I too was getting
20+ spams daily before I turned on the blacklists on my mail server. My
server is processing roughly 700 messages a day, about 2 get through a
month and the last 2 day report was 1428 processed and 38 blocked - and
I received no spam in my inboxes. What makes these numbers interesting
is that the number of messages processed has increased 2 fold within
that year and the number of spam messages are slowly decreasing. It's
near impossible to tell if the ineffectiveness of spam on this domain is
making an impact on the amount of attempts - it quite possible may be
coincidental or a picture of that industry as a whole.

I'm using rblsmtpd with Spamcop, dsbl.org and ordb.org. I have used
rblsmtpd in sendmail and qmail with good results.

Yes, I do that currently for my mail and for customers.

My mail servers turn away about 10,000 spam messages a week. That's
for me and all my customers combined. The number is deceptive because
much of the software that spammers use doesn't understand error codes
and continues trying to deliver their message even when given the
SMTP error code to go away. So, the number may be high. However, when
that happens, I either block these ill-behaved servers at the
firewall, or lie to them when they do their DNS query, so the number
may be low.

The nice thing about Postfix for my customers is the white list
capability. I can be aggressive when suppressing spam but allow
white mail to get through.

Because you'd have to take the time to understand them and
configure them. In particular, you need to understand when
one of these features has a high probability of turning away
white mail.

That's true but sometimes just to see how effective the other lists are I run 
the rejected IP openrbl.org and Spamcop still lists more IPs than any of the 
other well-known lists. For the spam I'm getting I've found that the Spamcop 
list and relays.osirusoft.com catch about 95% of all my spam and then I use a 
couple of the lists from blackholes.us to block all mail from China and 
Korea. Just about everything else gets filtered by SpamAssassin.

I'll admit I don't know good style from bad, good code from bad, and ugly
unless I look in the mirror, so what could I do to make this better? 

I know there is an issue with 
elif [ $b = $COUNT ] ; then
it should be
elif [ $b = $COUNT ] && [ $y != 0 ] ; then 
but that only is for making the function work correctly when the number of
returns is less than HOW_MANY. 

I would love to understand how to write the script so that not only did it
work, but it was written in the right / best way. 

Thank you
Russell

I use Postfix' RBL checks with some of the more conservative lists and
that's about it; I run amavisd-new with SpamAssassin and Razor through
postfix' 'content_filter' mechanism, and that catches almost all of my
spam.  I prefer the weighted heuristic method over boolean reject/deny
checks--it's mostly maintenance-free and I don't have to muck with
complex regexps.

I've done this setup with a number of customers, also plugging in Sophos
Anti-Virus and it is effective and preforms very well.

I've been using Eric Raymond's bogofilter, which was inspired by
Paul Graham's paper. I've found it to be *very* effective, once the
data bases had been sufficiently populated with samples of spam
and non-spam.

I've been frustrated by too many incomplete and/or out-of-date sources of

me how to implement extra features (such as printer support or roaming 
profiles) that I don't want or need.

My particular question would be: how can I discover which parts of the 
sample smb.conf file are irrelevant to my application and therefore safe to 
omit?

All I really want is a computer to centralize passwords on a current 
peer-based network so that I don't have to fix all six machines when I 
change one user account's password.

I'm not trying to make the W2k server a BDC; I've read already that Samba 
doesn't do that. Besides, I only have six clients in one LAN with no WAN 
links anywhere. There isn't enough authentication traffic to require a BDC. 
I just want to make it a member server in the domain so that it will 
consult with the PDC when a network resource request of some sort arrives.

I'd certainly like to see the file, but there are dozens of other PLUG 
subscribers who probably don't care. Would you consider Emailing it 
directly to me? I'll certainly "pay it forward" if anyone ever asks me how 
I succeeded in this endeavor.

Hi gang,

Another chance at fame and glory. I want to collect True Tales of Sysadmins on 
New Jobs, or, Inheriting A Big Mess and Surviving.

How do you deal with taking over a new job, or new customer, and their 
computing infrastructure is a complete mess? Every version of windows, 
various *nixes and BSDs, weirdo no-name routers, switches, and other 
components, and nothing is documented. Printers are shared through user's 
PCs. Domains and groups are higgledy-piggledy. Cables are snarled, circuits 
are overloaded, passwords are lost. What's your plan of attack? How do you 
explain it to your boss or client? 

The best true tales will be published in an article in crossnodes.com, with 
your name and everything. Successes only, please. Keep it around 2-3 
paragraphs. I wish I had room for long gory tales with happy endings, but I 
only get 1000 words.

Reply off-list, of course. Thanks!

Ah. One issue that I had was that I couldn't figure out how to have
automatically expiring passwords or how to have users change their passwords
from their machines. Additionally, there are *two* passwords that need to be
changed (as far as *I* can figure out) - the Samba password and the *nix
password. I'm not a guru by any stretch of the imagination...

If you'd like, I can take a look at your smb.conf file and make comments on
it.

I've been frustrated by too many incomplete and/or out-of-date sources of
information. I've also been frustrated by the HowTo documentation telling
me how to implement extra features (such as printer support or roaming
profiles) that I don't want or need.

My particular question would be: how can I discover which parts of the
sample smb.conf file are irrelevant to my application and therefore safe to
omit?

All I really want is a computer to centralize passwords on a current
peer-based network so that I don't have to fix all six machines when I
change one user account's password.

Backup PDC.. heh... yes... BDC... I don't have much reason for running a

I don't know how to get the passwords expire, but sync'ing them up isn't
difficult.  You must manually sync them the first time, if I understand
things properly... but from then out you just use proper 'passwd
program' and 'unix passowrd sync' lines and as long as all password
changes are made via SMB, it all stays sync'd up.  What it does,
essentially, is takes that password you entered for samba and runs
passwd, inputting that password for your account.

See the example I just posted for how it works for me...

My unique Plug list email address is getting spammed, so I'm changing it. I'm 
guessing some <expletive deleted> spammer signed up for the list long enough 
to collect some addresses, as the Web archives do not contain user's 
addresses.

I mention it in case anyone else is getting spammed through the Plug lists. 
No, you're not imagining it. 

Maybe it's time to launch a counter-offense. Like selling fake spam software 
and lists. Program it to do evil things to the sender, mwah ha ha.

I was thinking along the lines of:
-turn off CPU fans
-electric shocks
-low-level hard drive format
-flash ROM halfway
-brain burning

and other randomized acts of violence and retribution.

Subject: [PLUG] MBR Question
Message-ID: <1044888178.1421.4.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I just got a new motherboard.   I transplanted my two hard drives over
to the new computer.  Harddrive 1 has a windows XP installation and
Harddrive 2 has a redhat installation.  I use grub to select which drive
to install to.  When I transplanted the two over, the linux installation
comes up great.  But the windows installation does not like it.  I'm
unable to boot into Windows and I'm most likely going to need to
reinstall it.

The question I have is after I reinstall Windows how do I restore the
MBR that the reinstall is going to overwrite?

Actually, they could just download the full archive of plug and there 
are plenty of email addresses in that.  (yours, mine, etc...) Maybe we 
could have a bot do a bit of editing in there?

One method would be to have grub make a boot floppy.


Install XP..

Boot off the floppy..

Run Grub to install itself in MBR.

Dear All:

I am looking for a TV card for my linux box?
I have cable TV and want to be able to watch them
on my linux box.  I found a lot of TV cards (that have
coaxial input) for Windows but have not been
able to find one that supports linux.

Any recommendation much appreciated.

thanks

I have an AverMedia Stereo from Fryes (about $50) that works fine.  I run
'xawtv' to see the picture, and I'm using the coax input.  

You should be fine with a capture card that uses one of the chips from
Brooktree.  Here is my '/sbin/lspci' output in case you find it useful:

    00:09.0 Multimedia video controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt878 Video Capture (rev 11)
    00:09.1 Multimedia controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt878 Audio Capture (rev 11)

Good luck,

Marc

Wait, you get this to work without having to recompile the kernel or did
you have to do that? I bought this exact same card this weekend and it
wasn't recognized  as the right card, so the audio is messed up. I get the
SAP audio on many channels or no audio at all using kwintv.

Have you tried using it as a PVR? What are the hardware requirements for
that?

No kernel recompile was necessary, but you may need to mess with your
/etc/modules.conf file a bit to get rid of the SAP problem:

    options bttv gpiomask=0x0f audiomux=14,0,0,0,0

The values in "audiomux" were derived experimentally; I just kept trying
numbers from 1 on up until I got the right sound for the video.  I learned what
(little) I know of this from a Google hit and some browsing of the "bttv"
module's source code in the kernel tree.

I have tried using MythTV (http://www.mythtv.org/) with some success.  I am
waiting for this application to develop a little further before I jump back in.
I don't have a good sense for the hardware requirements yet.

You can download drivers from the ATI website, they are the same drivers
as for the "FireGL" card.  Or, if you don't want 3D, you can use the
XFree86 RPMS from the latest RedHat beta (assuming you run RedHat, of
course)

In your preferences, have you perchance clicked the button that says"

On the page in question, the images are served from a different

I'm having trouble getting my TV Card working properly. Only another list,
someone told me the following.

--------------------------------------
things like upgrading V4L/V4L2. If you want to upgrade bttv, you also
need the kernel sources. IIRC, a kernel recompile is not necessary. Just
"make menuconfig" and "make dep" should be enough.
--------------------------------------

Now I may be ignorant to Linux, but aren't those commands part of the
process of recompiling the kernel? Can they be run on their own?

I haven't yet attempted to play DVD's on this
computer, but I am about to make the attempt. I
downloaded and installed xine.

However, although my DVD-ROM drive will play CD's,
will it be recognized as a DVD drive? I downloaded a
package to patch the kernel for UDF. Will I need to
take this step? How do I know?

I'm somewhat embarrassed to comment on this subject,
due to my degree of expert knowledge. You won't get
any modules by doing this, so they must not be

Ummm... if I remember correctly, UDF is a way to write data to CDRs and
DVD-Rs.  The former only in Windows, the latter also in Linux.

If what you want to do is play DVDs... Xine will only play un-encrypted
DVDs without some hacking.  I would suggest using Ogle for playing
DVDs.  It does a good job as far as I'm concerned.  It is also pretty
darned simple to use.  :-)

As for patching the kernel for UDF... I really don't see why you would
need to do that to play DVDs.

Message-ID: <000b01c2d135$c612fc00$f500a8c0@susanka8qvbt4p>

I was dazzled and amazed at David Mandel's demonstration of
Knoppix/Linux on CD in January, and have tried to similarly dazzle and
amaze colleagues of mine - without similar success.  

 

I have a copy of KNOPPIX_V3.1-2003-01-20-EN.iso that I copied onto a CD,
but it's not booting.  When I've pulled the hard drive from my laptop,
to make sure that it's not booting Windows from the hard drive, my
laptop seems to see the CD, but reports "Operating System not found".
I've read all the FAQ's I can from the Knoppix site, but can't see what
I'm doing wrong.  

 

Any suggestions?

 

Thanks,

 

Susan

By "copied onto a CD" what do you mean? The iso should be a bootable
image (all the Knoppix isos I've installed have been) and all that's
required to put them on cd is 
"cdrecord dev=<bus,id,lun> KNOPPIX_V3.1-2003-01-20-EN.iso"

I'm sorry, what do you mean by that? Essential? 

I'm just asking (since I understood make dep to be part of a larger process) what doing make dep on its own would do.

"copied onto CD" means that we used HP RecordNow in Windows and hit the
"Make a Data Disc" button to copy the .iso file onto a CD.  It seemed to
compare well with the "how to burn a CD in Windows" I saw in one of the
Knoppix FAQs.  I think it's the Windows equivalent of the "cdrecord"
command you gave me.  I also checked the file size of the .iso file
against the original mirror on the source site, and it matched.  

Thanks for the question - it was a good one.

I've never used HP RecordNow, but I'm guessing that "Make a Data Disc" is not the option that you wanted.  Usually the option that you want is something like, "Create CD from disk image".  The difference being that "Make a Data Disk" probably just copies the ISO onto the CD as one file.  Where as the "Create CD from disk image" creates the file system on the CD as described in the ISO image.  HTH.

Does the CD have files on it or does it have one giant knoppix.iso file
on it?

If the former, we can look in to other stuff ... if the latter, you
burned it wrong.  Can the HP software burn a file as a track, maybe?  I
think B's Recorder Gold (cheap software we have here) has to burn ISO
images as tracks...

Just putting an ISO image into an iso9660 filesystem isn't going to do
it - the .iso file *is* the iso9660 filesystem.  :-)

Unfortunately that isn't going to work. ISO makes it easier to move around
the contents of a CD by rolling it all into one file. For the image to work,
it needs to be reverted back into it's component files when it is burned.

The HP software does not have the ability to do this. What it does is simply
burn the ISO file itself to CD, which is not the same thing. Rather than
just a CD with whatever.ISO on it, you should have multiple files. You're
going to need another burning program. I know that Nuro and CDRWin will do
the job. AFAIK there is no free app. for windows that will do it.

There are some things that need a current kernel source tree to
compile correctly, I'm no expert either, but I'm betting that make
menuconfig & make dep make symlinks or something similar that
determines which specific (possibly processor dependant?) headers are
used, and this could certianly affect compilation of other things.

Oops, looks like the newest version of the HP software will in fact burn ISO
images. It's about time ;)

In HP RecordNow, goto help, about, and check the version number. If it's 3.5
you should be able to do it. If it's not, you can download the 3.5 update
from HP's site. I'd post the exact link, but it's pretty long. Just goto the
support page for your particular burner.

There's also BIOS issues on the computer to explore. Most newer 
computers with standard settings probably boot from a CD if it's there, 
but an older computer, or one with not so standard settings might not 
boot from a CD. Easy enough to check, even though it's probably not your 
problem.

You don't need UDF to play DVD video.  You need UDF support to mount a UDF
filesystem.  Playing DVD video is like playing CD audio in that you don't
mount the device when you access the media.

MPlayer will play DVD video with direct access to all the titles and
chapters and various audio channels and angles.  I've never had it fail
and it's very fast and clean.  (I've gotten it to display menus, but
haven't bothered to see if I can navigate them or not... I usually just
play the titles directly.)

Ogle will allow you to navigate the menus, but my experience is that it's
rather unstable.

I've used Xine for playing DVDs, but I found the chapter access weak.

One thing I've done on my laptop is to install btmgr on the harddrive,
btmgr will boot from a CD.  This could probably be done with a floppy as
well.

                        Aspire to Crudeness -- Issue 33

  February 6, 2003

  by Don Marti, Editor in Chief of Linux Journal
     _________________________________________________________________

                         This Week's Sponsor: Emac

                 Embedded Linux Starter Kit from Emac Inc.

   Imagine running embedded Linux on a single-board computer! Get all you
   need in this 2.4 kernel compatible single-board computer starter kit
   from Emac. Emac has been offering an impressive line-up of products
   for the embedded systems market since 1985. Kits start from as low
   $399.00 US. Call now at 618-529-4525 or visit us on-line:
   http://www.emacinc.com.
     _________________________________________________________________

   Infoworld sent out a survey asking, "Do you think tech spending will
   improve in 2003 from last year?"

   Improve? As far as I'm concerned, "improve" is having to spend less.
   Last I heard, half of the capital investments US businesses were
   making was in information technology, and even if you call it
   Information Technology it's still just a bunch of sand and poetry. I'd
   like to see more of you people get jobs, but realistically those are
   going to come on the customer side--actually making information
   technology work in a business--rather than at some hot new vendor. If
   I were a betting man I would bet on Doc Searls' prediction that
   information technology is going to look more and more like the
   construction industry.

   Speaking of Doc, he's Mr. Controversy over at the Linux Journal web
   site, with one article offering some advance speculation about the
   Lindows conference:
   http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6611 and another article calling
   for comments on how Linux is changing the way company IT departments
   work:
   http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6601.

   Now that vendors are sending you the source and allowing you to have a
   clue without violating the EULA, are you getting that clue and using
   it to help business? Tell Doc:
   mailto:doc at ssc.com. He's looking for people who are using Linux and
   related technologies to get smarter and to make their companies
   smarter.

   Way over on the other side of the "smart/not smart" line, those wacky
   venture capitalists are at it again:
   http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/business/5100882.htm: "San
   Jose's Rackable Systems, a provider of rack-mounted high-density
   computer server and storage systems, said it has raised $21 million
   from Parthenon Capital."

   Remember that scene in Time Bandits where the kid yells, "Mum! Dad!
   Don't touch it! It's evil!", and they touch it anyway? Is $21 million
   worth putting venture capitalists on your company's board?

   From the devoted FCC-watchers and ham radio spectrum defenders at the
   American Radio Relay League comes some FCC news:

     The FCC has launched ECFS Express, an updated electronic system
     that the Commission says will make it easier for some members of
     the public to file comments on FCC proceedings. ECFS Express is a
     simplified version of the popular Electronic Comment Filing System
     (ECFS), but it is not available for all FCC proceedings.

     ECFS Express focuses on topics rather than docket numbers, and [it]
     requires minimal input by consumers seeking to participate in the
     Commission's public rule-making process. ECFS Express is accessible
     from the FCC home page at www.fcc.gov:
     http://www.fcc.gov. Users click on the "File Comments" logo. Anyone
     who wants to comment just has to click on a topic, fill in their
     personal information, write their comments and hit "SEND."

   I checked this out, and it really is easy. So now there's no excuse
   for not saying exactly how you feel about the Broadcast Flag Mandate
   and other anti-freedom, pro-monopoly proposals before the FCC.

   Also in the "easy ways to complain about the government" department,
   my Representative in Congress, Anna Eshoo, now has a stock paragraph
   about one of the DMCA reform bills. So I'm still getting form letters
   back about DMCA reform, but the good news is she now has a stock reply
   paragraph about the DMCA.

   Unfortunately the stock paragraph doesn't yet address the point I made
   in my first letter, so it's time to send another one. Feel free to
   make fair use of any of the text here. If you need a quick way to send
   letters, I recommend either Abiword (a point-and-click word processor)
   or for real power, your favorite editor, LaTeX. There's a LaTeX letter
   tutorial:
   http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3387 on the LJ site.

     Dear Representative Eshoo:

     Thank you for your reply to my letter regarding H.R. 5522, the
     Digital Choice and Freedom Act of 2002. While it is true that if
     reintroduced and passed, this bill would, as you say, help in
     "protecting consumers' ability to enjoy digital copyrighted
     material", there is another important issue at stake.

     The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) needs reform not only
     to protect fair use rights, but also to ensure that information
     technology research can continue. Under the DMCA, copyright holders
     and established consumer electronics vendors can lock out
     competition by preventing the development of new technologies.

     The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), which is the leading
     scientific society for computer science, filed an amicus brief in
     Eric Corley v. Universal City Studios et al., a civil case in which
     a group of movie studios used the DMCA to suppress the first
     DVD-playing software for the Linux operating system. The
     association wrote,

     "The concern of the ACM is that the DMCA prohibits scientific
     analysis and discourse on the cutting edge of research and
     development in encryption technologies, including research and
     development of copyright protection tools and expertise."

     Because new technologies are essential to the economy of the 14th
     district, DMCA reform to allow research and fair use is especially
     critical for our area. It is for this reason that it is important
     for you to co-sponsor either the Digital Choice and Freedom Act of
     2002 or H.R. 107, the Digital Media Consumer's Rights Act. Thank
     you for your consideration.

   Answers to Questions

   One of the most common questions on user group mailing lists is "Which
   is the best distribution?" Here's a slightly revised version of what
   is becoming my standard answer.

   "The most important part of picking a distribution is thinking about
   where you will go for help, and what distribution that source of help
   understands. That's true if your source of help is a vendor, a
   consultant or a users group.

   "As a home user, you'll probably be asking your local Linux users
   group for help when you need it. So get on the mailing list and just
   "lurk" for a while. See what the most helpful people on the list use
   and install that. That way if you have a question, you'll be more
   likely to reach someone who has already dealt with it."

   Security

   If anybody is turning the recent Microsoft worm outbreak into an
   excuse for Microsoft-bashing, stop it. There's a real security lesson
   here, and if you can stop with the "neener, neener, hey Bill Gates,
   where's your security initiative now", you can learn something. And,
   hey! No mooning! That's just unprofessional.

   1. The best way to connect a computer to the Internet is not to
   connect it to the Internet. Use application-level proxies. If your
   database server needs to get a software upgrade, make it use a proxy.
   Same for desktop machines--it's a matter of minutes to set up a web
   proxy. And you should, of course, be using an internal name server.

   2. If you use a packet-filtering firewall, which you should almost
   certainly be doing, set it up totally closed, and open up as little as
   possible to get your job done. None of this "look out, there's a worm,
   block port whatever".

   3. Run as little software as you can, and run the simplest software
   you can. Most of the worm-infected systems weren't even servers--they
   merely had a vulnerable software component that the users didn't know
   was there.

   End of security lessons. They were kind of obvious, and you probably
   already knew them, but if one person doesn't have to reinstall and
   thereby gains an hour to BUG YOUR REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FOR DMCA
   REFORM it will all be worthwhile.

Subject: [PLUG] Beyond .COM - The Alternate Roots
Message-ID: <1044915147.1157.205.camel@red>

This month, the PANUG user group is having a presentation
at its monthly meeting that has wide appeal to all
Internet users:

 BEYOND .COM - THE ALTERNATE ROOTS

 Most users of the Internet are locked in to Web and
 email addresses that end in names like COM, NET, and
 ORG. These are called Top Level Domain names or TLDs.
 TLDs are tightly controlled by a non-government
 organization that operates as a government-sanctioned
 monopoly. It takes years for this organization to allow
 new TLDs, such as BIZ. Why so long?

 The excuse is that technical issues have to be worked
 out but the real reason is money and politics. The same
 organization controls our DNS so there's little we can
 do. Or is there?

 Numerous people and companies have created an
 alternative to this monopoly. They offer lots of TLDs
 - many are free and some are not. These alternate TLDs
 are supported by an alternate DNS. We call these the
 "alternate roots". Some articles and white papers on
 the subject claim that, if we use the alternate roots,
 we put the health of the Internet in jeopardy. But
 remember - it's not technical - it's about money and
 politics. Truth seldom flourishes in that environment.

 This presentation will bring you up to speed on the
 issues, and DEMONSTRATES LIVE that we can easily use
 the "standard roots" and the "alternate roots'
 together to access any of the TLDs - without affecting
 the health of the Internet.  

Normally, PANUG meetings are members-only but non-members
can attend this meeting for $5.00, which includes pizza
and refreshments. The meeting is held at Novell's office
near Washington Square. Directions are on the PANUG web
site at http://www.panug.org. You must RSVP to attend.
Send your RSVP to info at panug.org. Space is limited and
PANUG members have preference.

For those people using an RPM based system, check out 
http://www.freshrpms.net/.  It includes the libraries needed to get Xine 
to work "correctly", with the exception of the win32 codecs.  (Which may 
not be enabled with that build.  I need to check.)

Thank you all for the help.  It was a switch and although a telnet or any
other means didn't seem to be able to get me to the box as a response the
telco IT guy found a way into the switch and fixed it.  I'm guessing you
can only telnet into from a particular IP range. I was on the same subnet.
 Oh well. All is fixed and I learned something new to add to my internal
mental tool box of tricks.

thanks again.

Just reverse the directions. Change "id:5:initdefault:" to 
"id:3:initdefault:" in /etc/inittab.

Log out and log back in.

If you set it up with a text-based login, then you can press
Ctrl-Alt-Backspace to kill X and kick yourself back to the 
command line.

Or you can press Ctrl-Alt-F2 (or F3, etc) to leave X running and
switch to a text login console.  If you have a graphical login
set up, then this is your best bet.  (Ctrl-Alt-F9 will take you
back to X.)

It's usually Ctrl-Alt-Backspace.

This statement is simply not true. You'll have to attend
the presentation to find out why.

> Ain't gonna happen.

There's already over 1.7 million second level domains registered
in the inclusive (alternate) name space and roughly 20 percent of
the people on the Internet, worldwide, have access to them. This
is not my statistic, so it could be inaccurate.

IANA? You're out of date by a few years.

They are being created only when ICANN can find people who
are willing to buy them for a few million dollars. Corrupt
is an understatement.

OK, I'm one of the fortunate ones who has never had a problem getting Mplayer 
to build or work. I also don't find configure/make/make install to be any 
more difficult than any number of GUI installers I have run on Windows 
(though some Windows software installers are easier, many have been equally 
or more difficult).

That said, this post is not about installing MPlayer--well maybe it is sorta.

I can't get it to play the new Animatrix movie. I get sound, but no video. I 
get a codec error....mjpeg: unsupported coding type (cf)


Has anyone been able to play the animatrix video with MPLayer or Xine?

Thanks.

Subject: [PLUG] VPN Suggestions?
Message-ID: <1044932801.19370.77.camel@duron.stpaultel.com>

Hey everybody-

I'm going to be gone for several months... unfortunately, I'm going to
be using AOL for my ISP.  I can't say why, but it is by far a better
deal than anything else.

I would really like to be able to connect to my local network here at
home from away, though.  I was looking at OpenVPN at first as it didn't
require any additional firewall rules on my firewall (and I'd like to
run the VPN server behind the firewall, ideally).

But... there doesn't seem to be a way to connect to an OpenVPN server
with Windoze.  Bummer.

So what kind of VPN solutions would you guys suggest I look in to?  I'd
just like a quick (ie; compressed) and secure connection to the systems
behind my firewall.  While I could always tunnel SSH connections through
the server, I'd rather have something a bit more robust and
native-looking to the remote side.

The firewall server is running Slackware 8.1.  The to-be VPN server is
running a hodgepodge type old pre-release slackware 9.0 install with
virtually everything recompiled from scratch.  The system that will be
connecting remotely (ideally, anyway) is running a dual-boot betweem
Gentoo (which likely will be unable to connect to the Internet) and
Windows XP Home Edition.

I'd appreciate any ideas.  :-)

Hey Ed,
This looked like it might be an interesting discussion so I went out to
new.net to take a look around. They're featured site is www.level9.mp3
and in following that link, my browser failed to resolve that name. I
run a cache name server that uses root-servers.net and I suspect that
the mp3 TLD is not included here. To verify that the problem was on my
end I reset my resolv.conf to my ISP's primary name server and got the
same result. Looking at the error, it's really unable to resolve the
name and not attempting to load a page and timing out. So here's my
question: If all DNS sites are going to need to add "alternet
root-servers" to their configs to see the "alternet TLDs" than would
that not validate Randal's (only one L this time) argument?

Steve

You can't resolve the names because your DNS cache and your ISP's
cache/name server/whatever only look to the ICANN roots to
resolve names. For the inclusive name space to work for you,
you'll need access to a cache/name server/whatever that looks
to the alternate roots OR non-ICANN TLD servers instead of or
in addition to the ICANN roots. The possibilities for doing this
will be presented at the PANUG meeting.

What's wrong with ssh when you just need a shell and vnc when you want a
desktop?  The Windows VNC viewer works well enough.  You'd just need to open
22 and 580n, 590n, on your firewall (assuming you start vnc with vncserver :n.)

Well, that isn't encrypted at all, for one thing.  To encrypt VNC you
have to forward ports over SSH and, IMHO, that is a kludge.

Besides, getting this to work would be very interesting... I've never
played with VPNs before.  :-)

    options bttv gpiomask=0x0f audiomux=14,0,0,0,0

It is likely you would need to reload the module with

    # rmmod bttv
    # insmod bttv gpiomask=0x0f audiomux=14,0,0,0,0
        Using /lib/modules/2.4.18-3/kernel/drivers/media/video/bttv.o

Verify that the CD is good by booting it on another system.
I downloaded the ISO a while back and it didn't work.
So I ran the checksum on it and it was bad.
Had to download it all over again.

If the bios won't support booting from the CD, you can make 
a boot floppy.  But some CD drives may not be supported.

If you get part way into the boot process and it freezes, press F2
for other boot options.
On one Dell laptop I need to use "knoppix noscsi"

The kernel sources include the source for many modules. You "make
(menu|x|)config" to choose which modules to compile, and then "make dep" and
"make modules". To compile the kernel itself, "make all".

I guess that by "upgrade bttv", the other respondant meant getting a newer
version of the bttv module? If so, I would think that you need to "make modules"
as well as what they said to do.

Right, this is as I expected from reading the post originally and as my
test showed. In fact, that was what I suspected going into the test. So,
given that for most of the Internet user community the ISP is the
primary source for name resolution, will you be presenting a listing of
ISPs that do support the new TLDs?

Message-ID: <20030211153305.84547.qmail@web20210.mail.yahoo.com>

Thanks to everyone that responded.
I need to be more clear on what is needed and
expected.
I am helping a non-profit web/education hosting
company out here in astorias,  raintree.org.
1. They provide internet access to the community and
also are teaching computer skills to help people
improve their job skills.

2. They have at least two NT email servers that are
constantly dying, and need to be replaced by something
stable (at this point, we are going with debian).

3. Talking to the head guy, they can not offer any
pay. Everyone working their right now is voluntering.
This may change if a grant is approved.

4.  I/We dont expect a full-time admin.  We would want
someone to help setup the email servers and then hand
over the maintenance to me or someone here. We can
learn and have done a pretty good job of it, but feel
very uncomfortable about setting up email servers with
no prior experience, and these are production servers,
ie people rely on them.

5. The issue of which email server to install has not
been decided and if you decide to help, you would be
involved in this discussion. right now postfix or
qmail seems to be the alternatives.

6. I will be contacting everyone who has contacted me,
but I have to go to work. :)

Thanks for your time,
G

If you use TightVNC, you don't need to open anything but 22. See the

This will kill the X server, but if you boot to a graphical login, it'll
take you right back to it.

If you want a pure terminal screen (not an xterm window) then change to
runlevel 3 and reboot.

Hey, that's pretty neat, I hadn't seen that before.

Unfortunately, though, the option doesn't seem to be availble in the
Windoze version.

Yes, but more importantly, you'll see how easy it is for an ISP
to do this.

Hmm. I hadn't thought to check that. You'd probably have to set up

Rob, be sure to test your solution  completely via AOL. I travel from 
time to time and have used AOL to access the web and then VPN'd into my 
corp offices etc. I had a few problems at AOL 7.0 but never could get my 
VPN to work using AOL 8.0.

AOL since day #1 has not been interested in the business user, just home 
users. My reason for AOL is the fact they have more local phone# than 
anyone else.

That's just it - wherever I am, I *know* I will have Internet access. 
Heck, I can dial up in Kuwait if I wanted to (albeit at $3 an hour or
so).

I'm well aware of the VPN problems dealing with AOL and am relatively
certain I will be able to work around them.

Just to find something that will do the trick for me......  :-)

I may almost have a scanner set up, but something
isn't quite right. It's a USB scanner, as are most
scanners sold today. 

The module was loaded manually with modprobe scanner

According to cat /proc/bus/usb/devices, the kernel
recognizes it (below).

I was told that the plustek.conf file was the one that
should be configured for this scanner; I adapted it
for automatic recognition of /dev/usb/scanner0

This was not recognized as a block device when
attempting to mount it, although it is listed in
/dev/usb.Finally, sane-find-scanner does not list the
scanner.

Does anyone know what the problem is?

For me, it was about the namespace and browser compatibility.  

There is a certain web application that is served up by apache on a
virtual host that is available only to the private LAN.  Unfortunately,
this application only runs in IE (ActiveX).  So, I needed the internal
DNS server to correctly resolve the host name, so that apache would
serve up the right application.  NETBIOS works too, which gives me easy
file transfers between the windows box and the linux server.

To solve it, I used PopTop and the native windows PPTP protocol.  It
uses "mppe" as the encryption protocol, and an IP protocol called "GRE",
though this is not to be confused with the Cisco version of "GRE", this
is the PPTP version of "GRE".  This protocol is also know as 47.  

Over the weekend I was able to modify my lrp firewall to forward a GRE
tunnel (of the PPTP variety) to the specified windows box.  This means
that my home network is not attached to my work network, only one
windows box inside my home network is attached to my work network.

It's not entirely stable, but was up for about 3 days before
mysteriously closing.  The windows network browser is having a hard time
(I transplanted the windows box into my home network, then hooked it
back up to the work network -- I think it is very confused), however,
searching for computers by ip address will almost always work, searching
by name will start to work as time goes by.  Another problem was that
windows pays no attention to the search order of the DNS; I had to
specify only the work DNS for IE to resolve the virtual host correctly. 
If any other DNS server was listed, IE would fail to resolve it.

I realize that there are more secure options out there, IPSEC comes to
mind, but this one has a major advantage -- I actually got it to work! 
I can't say the same about IPSEC, though it wasn't for lack of trying.

As much as I like ssh and vnc, VPN's do have a purpose.

Rob,

  My suggestion is probably not a good solution for you, but I can get data
access via my satellite phone from anywhere to anywhere. It's limited to
9600 bps, and the air time charge is $1.50 per minute, but it works.

  Haven't used it for data yet (no need to), but even in the Gorge and parts
of the Cascades I've found cellular telephone dead zones. The satellite
phone works like a charm in those locations.

Unfortunately, I belive the only way to cap an ethernet controler is by
using packet flow control found in the kernel.  Either the Trafic
Shaper, or the CBQ/fair queueing.  This is the only way I know how to do
it.

Check /var/log/messages for more info
mine spits out this

kernel: hub.c: USB new device connect on bus1/2, assigned device number 3
kernel: usb.c: USB device 3 (vend/prod 0x4b8/0x110) is not claimed by any 
active driver.

kernel: usb.c: registered new driver usbscanner
kernel: scanner.c: probe_scanner: User specified USB scanner -- 
Vendor:Product - 4b8:110
kernel: scanner.c: 0.4.6:USB Scanner Driver

When I launch xsane, I get a lot of warnings

kernel: scanner.c: open_scanner(1): Unable to access minor data

dunno why, but it seems to work anyway.

So make sure the kernel is happy.  Also, according to your /proc, there is 
no driver associated

whereas mine says

I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=ff Prot=ff Driver=usbscanner

I have a line in /etc/modules.conf
options scanner product=0x0110 vendor=0x04b8

so you might check that your says something like
options scanner product=0x220d vendor=0x04a9

Also, see if `lsmod` shows that usbcore is loaded

Here's where I am now: by giving a parameter with
modprobe scanner, I was able to get sane-find-scanner
to recognize the device as /dev/usb/scanner0.It still
could not be mounted as a block device, however.

Using cat /proc/bus/usb/devices, I found that the
driver was SUPPOSED to be usbscanner, wheich is
probably the source of the trouble. My /lib/modules
does not contain such a module; modprobe will not load
it. 

Any ideas about how to fix that? My version of
sane-backends (1.0.8-5) is not the most recent.It is
an rpm, so if I upgrade it will have to be removed
with the nodeps option.Anyhow, I hate to give up when
things are starting to look promising.

I was going to say something, but people have covered things pretty well.
The two major issues are:

     -  Burn Knoppix ISO image to CD as a raw burn using something like
        cdrecord.  The image has already been mastered as a bootable
        CD, so the complex part already done.  One simply has to burn
        it to the CD as a raw burn.  I'm afraid I don't know how this
        works with most non Unix CD burning software.

     -  Make sure the BIOS is set to try booting from CDROM before
        booting from disk.
        I'm assuming that both the CDROM and the hard disk are IDE.
        I have booted Knoppix on SCSI based systems, but as I recall
        there are a number of quirks.  However, I was successful with
        Knoppix.  I have not always been so successful booting
        DEMO Linux on systems with SCSI components.

                                          Sincerely,

   Bridge the Gap Between Physical and Virtual Networking with netstat:
   http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6613 -- Sean Conway looks
   at the open systems interconnect (OSI) model and how netstat can help
   those used to the physical side of the system understand what's going
   on in the network.

   Tale of Two Stories:
   http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6616 -- Scandal and bad
   news aren't the terrain of only the checkout-line newspapers. The tech
   industry also loves a good "star on the skids" story--even if it's not
   true.

  Tech Tip

   If you want to train a Bayesian spam filter on your mail, don't delete
   non-spam mail that you're done with. Put it in a "non-spam trash"
   folder and let the filter train on it. Then, delete only the mail
   that's been used for training. Do the same thing with spam.

   It's especially important to train your filter on mail that it
   misclassified the first time. Be sure to move spam from your index to
   your spam folder instead of merely deleting it.

   To do the training, edit your crontab with crontab -e and add lines
   like this:

6 1 * * * /bin/mv -fv $HOME/Maildir/nonspam-trash/new/* $HOME/Maildir/nonspam-t
rash/cur/ && /usr/local/bin/mboxtrain.py -d $HOME/.hammiedb -g $HOME/Maildir/no
nspam-trash

6 1 * * * /bin/mv -fv $HOME/Maildir/spam/new/* $HOME/Maildir/spam/cur/ && /usr/
local/bin/mboxtrain.py -d $HOME/.hammiedb -s $HOME/Maildir/spam

   Finally, you can remove mail in a trash mailbox that the Bayesian
   filter has already seen:

2 2 * * * grep -rl X-Spambayes-Trained $HOME/Maildir/nonspam-trash | xargs rm -
v

2 2 * * * grep -rl X-Spambayes-Trained $HOME/Maildir/spam | xargs rm -v

   Look for more information on Spambayes and the math behind spam
   filtering in the March issue of Linux Journal.

Well, it was interesting to look at, in that X is really intricate and I
couldn't even begin to understand most of the start up messages. It said
I have two "mouses" defined, one of which I have: PS2 and one I don't
IMPS.

I used both sndconfig and the new version included with RH 8.0 and when
it played a test sound nothing happened.

Context:
	motherboard: Ampton ddr 266
	sound stuff from boot up:

Intel 810 + AC97 Audio, version 0.22, 12:24:02 Sep  4 2002
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:02.7
i810: SiS 7012 found at IO 0xd400 and 0xdc00, IRQ 11
i810_audio: Audio Controller supports 2 channels.
i810_audio: Defaulting to base 2 channel mode.
ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x414c:0x4326 (Unknown)
i810_audio: only 48Khz playback available.
i810_audio: AC'97 codec 0 supports AMAP, total channels = 2

	speakers: plugged in to blue connector which I believe is line out.


Willing to entertain all possibilities.

This scanner is apparently only supported by the
latest version of sane-backends. I compiled it from
source code.

Once this is done, it is not necessary for the user to
load a driver manually. The color is better than I
expected it to be.

This is a popular scanner, available at very low
prices. If someone on this list is interested in
getting one, I can provide a scanned image to assist
in the decision about purchasing one.In fact, I may
put such an image on my Website.

Just to cover all the obvious stuff, check the permissions on /dev/audio. 
Sometimes they install as 600 and you need to change it to 666 so that
non-root users can listen to sounds.

That's probably not a problem. The IMPS mouse definition works with MS 
IntelliMouse devices on the PS/2 port; it also works with USB devices.

If you're using a wheel mouse or a USB mouse, then you'll want to use 
the IMPS protocol.

Can you provide

* a description of the mouse you're using (no. of buttons, type of 
  connector, wheel/no-wheel, ...)

* from your /etc/X11/XF86Config file
  - any ServerLayout sections
  - any InputDevice sections that define the mouse Driver

Checked it. Mine was owned by me and in the root group and 600. I
changed it to 666 for good measure.

I did note in /var/log/messages: modprobe: "Couldn't locate
sound-service-0-3"

One more obvious thing: are the speakers powered or not?  If not, the 
internal amp may be disabled and you won't hear anything--try headphones.

Also, at least on my soundblaster, blue is an input.  (I think.  It was hard 
to see without moving the box.)

Do you have an entry in /etc/modules.conf?  I'm not an expert on the new 
sound mechanisms (ALSA), and sound-service is different from sound-slot, but 
if it helps, I have

alias sound-slot-0 emu10k1

you'd change emu10k1 to i810 (or whatever it's called).

For those of you maintaining your own email black lists
or RBLs, my customers and I have been getting a lot of
spam from IP addresses allocated to rackspace.com in Texas.
I recall discussion here of using rackspace as a
co-location facility. rackspace has no database available
to the outside world to identify the IP blocks of their
individual customers (the spammers) and they don't return
phone calls about the matter.

As a result, we just blocked their 65.61.128.0/18
allocation entirely. They have other allocations and we'll
block them as well as we receive spam from them. If you use
IP addresses from their allocation, let me know what they
are and I'll white list them.

Message-ID: <GGEILBHDNBMGHFFFEIGOMEJINBAA.mikel@quantecllc.com>

Hello, all.

I'm hoping some of you web server/network gurus out there can point me in
the right direction.

Issue:

Our test website (hosted internally) is behind a firewall/router (Hawking
D945F).
We are running Windows 2000 Server. Active Directory, DNS - all set up.
The website is hosted on a Dell PowerEdge 1600 running Mandrake Linux 8.2,
using the Apache server.
>From inside the company: I can always get to the test site by typing the
internal IP address.

On the router, I set a DMZ entry to our existing website, also running on a
Linux system, Apache webserver. Works fine.
On the router, I set a DMZ entry to our test website. Nothing.

I look in the auth_log, error_log. Nothing. Looks like the request isn't
even getting to the web server.

Change the DMZ entry back to the old site - works fine.

So, it looks like the request is not being passed to the test server.

Any suggestions on where to look?

BTW, the router is not set up for DHCP. That's handled by our W2K server, as
is our DNS.

Thanks in advance!

Ah, that's interesting. So Linux and X think you've got a PS/2 mouse, 
not a USB mouse. I think you'll need to do some editing of your 
XF86Config file.

First, make a safe copy of your current /etc/X11/XF86Config file.

Then,

> EndSection

Comment out the Mouse0 and Mouse1 lines in the ServerLayout section. 
Add a new line just below Mouse1:

  InputDevice  "MouseLocal" "CorePointer"

Create a new InputDevice Section:

  Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier "MouseLocal"
    Driver     "mouse"
    Option     "Device"          "/dev/psaux"
    Option     "Protocol"        "IMPS/2"
    Option     "Emulate3Buttons" "off"
    Option     "ZAxisMapping"    "4 5"
  EndSection

You can leave the Mouse0 and Mouse1 InputDevice sections alone.

Restart X and see if it flies. :-)

It looks like the sound card was found by the kernel, that is good.

Try plugging into the green, sometimes the line out is muted, but the
speaker out is probably set to half volume.

To see if the sound card is functioning at some level, try playing an
audio cd.  This won't test your sound server, but will at least make
noise for you.  If this works, you need to open up a mixer program, and
see what has been muted and what hasn't.

Now, with the mixer open try a couple of different programs that are
supposed to make noise.

Report back with your findings.

After a few false starts, due to typos on my part, it is working. Is
there some reason for turning Emulate3Buttons off? What's the difference
between /dev/psaux and /dev/input/mice? 

I had thought that since the physical connector was PS/2 that the port
would also be. Doh!

All of the scroll mice that I have seen are actually 3 button mice.  The 3rd button being when you press down on the scroll wheel.  Because the scroll wheel is considered the 3rd button, you don't want to emulate it.  Also, my understanding of the "ZAxisMapping" line is that you are mapping buttons 4 and 5 to the Z axis.  Buttons 4 and 5 corresponding to a scroll up and scroll down of the scroll wheel.  so, in essence, X sees your mouse as being a 5 button mouse.

John H. answered the question about Emulate3Buttons.

As for the /dev entries, /dev/psaux is the PS/2 port while
/dev/input/mice is part of the USB "human interface device" (HID)
support. If you've got a kernel tree lying around, take a peek at 
the CONFIG_USB_HID section of Documentation/Configure.help.

Thanks for the help. I didn't realize how nice it would be to use the
wheel.
So if I were plugged in to a USB port, I'd use /dev/input/mice?

I don't usually use Evolution for file management, but when I do I often
have this problem. I navigate deep into the directory tree and find what
I want. Say I want to make a link from
/usr/java/j2sdk{version}/jre/plugin/i386/ns610/libjavaplugin_oji.so to
/usr/lib/mozilla{version}/plugins/

In KDE I  would be able to open a terminal, su and proceed. I don't see
how to do that in Evolution.

Evolution is a mail client - why would you use it for file management at
all?  I don't understand.

Can't you just open up a terminal using whatever menu whatever
windowmanager has set up for you and go from there?

aumix is one you probably have. It's a nice console mixer
that allows you to adjust all of the various volume and
balances. You will want to increase at least the main volume
and the pcm volume.

Message-ID: <E18j5qw-0000dg-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

Bear with me, it's been probably about 12 months or more since I've used the
tool "mtr." It's "Matt's TraceRoute" and what it does is do a traceroute and
then sit back and ping each host returned, and shows you over time what the ping
counts are. It can be used as a tool to test network reliability.

Work has a website at (www.craftpizazz.com) Not a plug, just a point of
reference. We (web guys) have been having an issue with FTPing to and from the
site, and I've installed Snort and seen some interesting results, but need more
quantification before I make a determination. Anyway, on to my question.

I've got a (relatively new) firewall located at the server location, and I
installed MTR and ran the MTR back to our firewall here at the company: 
I get back about 12 rows of hosts, each with between 1 and 5 percent packet loss.

If I go to another server I have access to, and do MTR from it to the webserver,
I have similar numbers with different servers in the list.

If I stay on that other server and go from there to a friend's server at
RackSpace, I get 0s and 1s.

Twelve to Eighteen months ago, 0s and 1s were acceptable; but up to 5% was not,
really, and I'd be calling the ISP. 

Naive question of the day?
Has the Internet been mangled enough that the 5% is an acceptable number, or
should I keep looking for a problem with the network layer?

You may in fact have a network problem, but do keep in mind that sending
back the ICMP "Time to live exceeded in transit" messages that tools
like mtr and traceroute rely on is about last in the order of priorities
that a busy router in the middle has to keep up on.

You can see higher latency and/or dropped packets from an intermediate
router when there is no problem with your end to end performance, simply
because the intermediate hops are too busy passing traffic to interrupt
their processors to create the ICMP reply to send back.

If your performance from wherever you're testing to your ftp server is
good, then you don't have a problem. If you are seeing problems end to
end, then tools like mtr, pchar, and others can help you isolate where
the problem is exactly happening.

Speaking of which, the "nanog" version of traceroute has some nice
options like showing the ASN & contact info for the networks through which
you're transitting.

If I saw 5% packet loss between any two hosts in any two well-wired
countries (US, Europe, East Asia, Australia), I'd be looking for a
problem.

My first hunch is that some router along the way is being asked to 
manage too much traffic. It might be a flood worm like the recent 
Sapphire, a DoS attack, or perhaps just poor capital spending :-)

It depends on the modeling code.  Common Lisp is good for lots of
different kind of programming, not just AI stuff.  There is some stuff
it isn't particularly good for.

Yes.

Yes.  E.g.:

Yes, but I don't have any direct experience with them.

Message-ID: <20030213003355.1741.qmail@web9606.mail.yahoo.com>

By now I have only one device I haven't used with
Linux, an IDE hard drive in an external FireWire case.
The system knows about it, for when it is hot-plugged
in, a stanza instantly appears in cat /proc/scsi/scsi:

Host: scsi2 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: WDC WD20 Model: 0BB-00CFC0       Rev:
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI
revision: 06

It might be convenient to use it. What would really be
helpful is if someone could tell me what the name of
this device was likely to be, so I could mount it. 

mount /dev/1394 /mnt/1394. Well, sort of...

Otherwise, is there a good source of information on
the subject?

At the moment, I have the contents of my Windows
partition on it, although I haven't accessed that
partition in a long time. I had been thinking about
backing that data up to CD's, and using the FireWire
drive to back up Linux data.

This should do it:

  dmesg | grep 'SCSI device'

Chances are, however, it'll just show up in order: if you've got no 
SCSI devices, it'll be /dev/sda; if you've got sda, it'll be sdb; ...

It turns out that the FireWire drive wants to call
itself /dev/sdb1. And is it fast!

That happens to be the "handle" of the digital camera,
however. After unplugging the hard drive, even
properly, I can't mount the camera with the same
device name without rebooting.

Or can I? It might be nice to know how to use both in
the same session, but it's difficult to conceive of a
scenario in which this would be necessary.

I'm sure glad that on my Pavilion 7950, the
receptacles for hot-plug devices are mounted on the front!

Me bad. I meant the file manager program that comes with Gnome as
opposed to the file manager program that comes with KDE. Of course, I
can always open a terminal, but it will open in HOME. In KDE, I could
open in in the directory where the file manager was currently open,
which in the case I gave, where you're deep in the tree, is convenient.

Weren't you just doing something like CLIPS, ie a rule based system
based on a simple application of fuzzy logic?  FWIW, I'd use Python:
very easy to learn and a reasonably big community.

Nautilus vs Konqueror, then....

Sorry, I don't use Nautilus, but I'm sure somebody might know how to
quickly open a terminal from a Nautilus directory.

Bill,

  Yes, and no. The models are rule-based, but they are fuzzy rules, not
explicit-case rules. One example frequently used by my mentor is a pricing
model for a British manufacturer done in the early 1980s. The four rules for
pricing a new product are:

	1. Our price must be high.
	2. Our price must be low.
	3. Our price must be near twice the manufacturing cost.
	4. If the competition price is not very high
		Then our price should be near the competition price.

  I understand that no one's been able to do this with a quantitative,
rule-based expert system.

Rule based stuff screams for Prolog.. but I don't know of much "real"
software written in a logic-based language.

Windows partition with it, and the Python code with it.

Interestingly, you can implement a Prolog in Common Lisp in under 400
lines (including comments).  

   $ wc -l *.lisp
       180 patmatch.lisp
       139 prolog.lisp
        59 unify.lisp
       378 total

The group that maintains Firewire for Linux has their own website. It's
where I found all the documentation I needed to get my FW drive up and
running.

Two _great_ resources:


"man sudo"

and

Just a plug for that book.. Paradigms of AI Programming is an excelent lisp/AI resource :)

Well worth the $ and wait (it's a reasonably difficult book to find).

From: Ed Sawicki <ed at alcpress.com>
To: plug at lists.pdxlinux.org

For those of you maintaining your own email black lists
or RBLs, my customers and I have been getting a lot of
spam from IP addresses allocated to rackspace.com in Texas.
I recall discussion here of using rackspace as a
co-location facility. rackspace has no database available
to the outside world to identify the IP blocks of their
individual customers (the spammers) and they don't return
phone calls about the matter.

As a result, we just blocked their 65.61.128.0/18
allocation entirely. They have other allocations and we'll
block them as well as we receive spam from them. If you use
IP addresses from their allocation, let me know what they
are and I'll white list them.

Ed

Never seen those before... however if you don't want your logs to be
bloated with codered/ nimida stuff...
add something like this this to your httpd.conf file

# Ignore IIS problems and script kiddies
SetEnvIf Request_URI "/cmd.exe" attacks dontlog
SetEnvIf Request_URI "/root.exe" attacks dontlog
SetEnvIf Request_URI "/cgi-local/formail.pl" attacks dontlog
SetEnvIf Request_URI "/default.ida" attacks dontlog
SetEnvIf Request_URI "/default.ida?" attacks dontlog
SetEnvIf Request_URI "default.ida" attacks dontlog
SetEnvIf Request_URI "default.ida?" attacks dontlog


having mentioned this, does anyone else have methods of keeping their logs
clean? Care to share?

Bill,

  Most of the work dune with fuzzy logic and models has been with
controllers. Your autofocus camera and image-stabilized videocam are other
examples.

  There are _very_ few folks who have been applying fuzzy logic to business
problems. One's been making his living at it -- as an independent consultant
-- since 1972. There's one other of whom I'm aware who's been trained by
this one fellow, and this other one is in Minnesota.

  There are quite a few companies applying neural nets and genetic
algorithms to many of the same problems (e.g. insurance ratings, fraud
detection) but there are problem classes that can be addressed by one and
not the others.

  I'm learning the nuts and bolts of fuzzy system modeling which includes GA
and neural net components in some models. I _can_ do it all in C (or C++ or
python or prolog or lisp or scheme or java or ...). The language really
doesn't matter. For the use I want to make of these models I'm considering
if learning and using CNU/Lisp (an implementation of Common Lisp) might make
model development much quicker than using C. Each project and situation
where this would be the most rational and pragmatic approach is different.
Therefore, each project/situation needs to have a new model built from
scratch. The fuzzy manipulation functions remain the same, and the UI will
probably be constant, but the derivation of fuzzy rules and the way the
model is structured will vary each time. That's where prototyping and
development speed can make a difference in time to a working model and cost
to my client.

Thanks,

Rich

I just implemented the following:  Enable name based virtual hosts in apache
for all ip addresses.  Then setup as the first listed virtual host something
that doesn't match anything.  When someone reaches my site using an ip address
only, they go to the first VirtualHost because their ServerName doesn't match
anything.  That way all the logs go to their own file.  I have all my other
VirtualHosts logging to standard error_log and access_log.  I suppose you
could direct the junk_logs to /dev/null as well.


NameVirtualHost *

<VirtualHost *>
ServerName "codered.stopper"
ServerAdmin "webmaster at mydomain"
ErrorLog /var/log/apache/junk_error_log
CustomLog /var/log/apache/junk_access_log combined
</VirtualHost>

Subject: [PLUG] RHN subscription warning!
Message-ID: <3E4BD075.5020403@easystreet.com>

FWIW, anyone who is subscribing to the RedHat network should
be aware of the following clause in the current RHN "Use and
Subscription Agreement":

  ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTIONS. For annual subscriptions to the Service,
  the initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective
  Date and shall continue for one (1) year. Thereafter, the term
  shall renew for successive terms of one (1) year each unless either
  party gives written notice to the other of its intention not to
  renew at least sixty (60) days prior to the commencement of the
  next term. Customer may provide notice of non-renewal in writing
  to Red Hat by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested,
  to the following address: Red Hat, Inc., Customer Service, 1801
  Varsity Drive, Raleigh, North Carolina 27606. You may not terminate
  the Service or this Agreement by email.

Best current practice for dealing with this kind of clause (if you
need the service) is to enclose a notice of non-renewal with the
original purchase.

I do find this type of agreement (especially the requirement for
registered/certified USPS mail) to be extremely objectional.  
RedHat's use of this *scam* has certainly lowered my respect for
them at least a couple of notches.

Subject: [PLUG] Strange CD-RW problem
Message-ID: <20030213175253.13382.qmail@web9602.mail.yahoo.com>

My HP desktop computer has two CD drives: a CD-RW and
a DVD-ROM. This is a rather common arrangement.

Yesterday evening, upon bringing up my disk-mounting
GUI tool, I noted that the CD-RW was no longer there.
Since /dev/cdrom1 is no doubt a nickname, perhaps the
symbolic link had disappeared. So I attempted to mount
the drive by its likely actual name: /dev/scd0,
/dev/sr0, etc. None of these attempts was successful.

I inserted a blank CD into the drive, brought up
xcdroast, and this DID work.This application does not
use the same device names as the other ones do.

It also boots from a CD, not then under the control of
the installed operating system. 

Provided that I use the DVD drive for all CD reading
functions, I am apparently not inconvenienced by this
strange occurrence. But I am still wondering what
causes a device to "disappear."

Subject: [PLUG] Partial SOLUTION to Auto Install and "other.img" ANY WORKAROUNDS?
Message-ID: <20030213182313.9B3FE56DE@joseph.doink.com>

Quite a while ago I posted this on alt.os.linux.mandrake:

    At the end of my MDK9 installations I create an auto install
    floppies.  Then I can boot from them and reinstall the whole
    system with less (of my choosing) interaction than the first
    installation.  So far, so good.  If I do this on my machine
    with an IDE CDROM drive, then everything works just fine.  If
    I do this on my machine with only a SCSI CDROM drive, for
    which I'm required to originally boot using the "other.img",
    then my CDROM drive is not detected and I can't install.

    How can I get around this problem?

    Can I somehow create an auto install floppy with the kernel
    from the "other.img"?

    At the end of an Expert install I'm offered a chance to
    create a package list floppy.  I didn't do this at the
    time, and I can't figure out how to create one, short of
    reinstalling.  Anyone know how to do this?

    I've tried setting my BIOS to boot from SCSI, rather than "C"
    drive (which is my only IDE drive in the box) or floppy, but
    that didn't seem to work.  I've got two SCSI hard disks, a
    SCSI tape drive, and two SCSI CDROM drives (one's a writer)
    in this system.  What might be required to boot from the
    CDROM?


SOLUTION:

    The Mandrake installation instructions say to boot in
    whatever normal manner you do, then at the Help Screen
    press <F1> and boot up with the boot options 'linux
    defcfg="floppy"' without the single quotes, but with the
    double quotes.


This will let me boot from other.img, so that I can get the right
SCSI drivers for my Buslogic card, and it advertises to let me
use the package list from the floppy disk I created during the
initial install.  I haven't tried this yet.

I still don't know how to make a "package list floppy" short of
reinstalling.  Any ideas there folks?

Thanks....

Do you mean CMUCL?  That's not a bad choice, but you might want to
keep in mind that since Common Lisp is an ANSI standard, it has
multiple implementations (both free-as-in-freedom and commercial), so
it doesn't matter that much which implementation you choose, and you
needn't limit yourself to one.  Learn the language, and then leave
yourself a choice of implementations.

I use CLISP quite a bit, because it is a little more light-weight for
exploration.  And even though CLISP compiles to byte-codes and uses a
matching byte-code interpretter, it is surprisingly quick.  CLISP also
has a nice 'readline' (command history, completion, editing, like
Bash) CLI for quick experimentation.

This probably isn't it, but worth checking. If you can mount it as
root that would be a good indication this is the problem:

Check that your user has permissions to the generic scsi device
(/dev/sg*) If you use the devfs, you can change the perms in your
/etc/devfs/devfsd or perms file (depending on teh distro). I have the
following line:

REGISTER ^sg[^/]*$ PERMISSIONS root.scsi 0660

and my normal user is a member of the scsi group.

Message-ID: <20030213191445.GB26108@rauhaus.org>

What would be the nicest way in Perl to grab the name of the most recent (by
modfication time) file in a directory with a bunch of files?

I could do something gross like:
@files = `/bin/ls -tr /var/local/flows/ft*`;

But no, I shouldn't have to shell out for pretty much anything these
days.

Would it be more like:

for (</var/local/flows/ft*>) {
	$file_hash{$_} = (stat $_)[9];
}

and then sort by the hash by value? I'm betting there's a better way,
and am happy to hear suggestions.

That is probably your problem.  RH should have some fancy tool for
setting it properly... if not, you just make a symlink from
/etc/timezone to the correct timezone file, if I remember correctly.

ntpd checks the time constantly... constantly fixing it.  My ntpd server
checks against six other servers, and then I use it for my LAN.  You
should read the documents at ntp.org... they're quite informative.  :-)

If you wanted something that just periodically fixes your clock (once an
hour?  once a day?) use cron and ntpdate (Which is actually being
depreciated, but I don't remember the ntpd switch to work like ntpdate
off the top of my head).

With NTP 4.x I think an NTP server will initially start polling about 
every 64 seconds and as things stabilize it starts increasing the 
number of seconds between polls until it gets to a maximum of polling a 
server ever 1024 seconds. 

Before you startup an NTP server make sure you system time is set 
reasonable well. This is normally done using "ntpdate -b <ntp-server>" 
to force the system time to be set rather than slewing it. You might 
also want to be sure that you write the contents of the system clock to 
the hardware clock as part of the shutdown process so the system time 
will be set fairly reasonably when the system is booted. 

If you don't update the hardware clock on shutdown you can also do this 
via a cron job at some reasonable interval. I noticed the hardware 
clock on my workstation was way off after I went many months without a 
reboot as NTP was only keeping the kernel's system time updated and did 
nothing with the hardware clock.

Well, I don't know what to say, but it's been _interesting_.  My problem
had something to do with rebooting. Everytime I did I would get a 16
hour (note we're in GMT-8) difference between hwclock -r and date. I
could then use date --set "-16 hours" to correct date, but the moment I
rebooted, the same 16 hour difference occurred. Finally chkconfig'ed
ntpd out and rebooted and it solved the problem, at least this time.

In that case, historically, GNU Lisp has been not such a hot choice.
I haven't looked recently, but in the past it hasn't lived up to the
usual reputation for quality that we associate with the GNU label.
Here's what the gcl man page says about its history:

   The GCL system contains C and Lisp source files to build a Common
   Lisp sytem.  CGL is derived from Kyoto Common LISP (kcl), which was
   written in 1984 by T. Yuasa and M. Hagiya (working under Professor
   R. Nakajima at the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences,
   Kyoto Uni- versity).  The AKCL system work was begun in 1987 by
   William Schelter at the University of Texas, Austin, and continued
   through 1994.  In 1994 AKCL was released as GCL (GNU Common Lisp)
   under the GNU public library license.

More recently, GCL has principally been used as a vehicle for the
free-as-in-freedom version of Maxima, the symbolic math package
developed at MIT.  For a long time, it wasn't very conformant to the
ANSI standard.  CLISP (aka GNU CLISP) is probably a better choice.  It
is also GPL'd and distributed by the FSF.

For a more complete listing of implementations, see:

I had a problem with time on my system when rebooting.  It turned out
that a time config file in /etc was symbolically linked to a file in
another partition.  The problem was that at bootup, the partition was
not yet mounted when hwclock was run.  So it didn't know the correct
time zone and assumed GMT.  I dual boot with windows, so my hwclock is
set to local time, not GMT.  I solved the problem by copying the
appropriate timezone file to /etc.

I don't remember the file names exactly.  But something like

 /etc/localtime   -> /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles


It's interesting that your off by 16 hours and you are in a -8 timezone.
16 = 2*8.  Confusing GMT and localtime twice could cause the 16 hour
difference.

According to the docs, I'm not the first to have this
problem after adding a digital camera as /dev/sda1. In
that case, the solution was to take the kudzu entries
out of fstab. I know next to nothing about kudzu, so
as long as I can still burn CD's, I might leave it
alone until I am more knowledgeable on the subject.
Any kudzu fans, or detractors, on this list?

The problem is not one of Kudzu, per se, but of how cd burners work.

To use a cd burner currently, you need to use ide->scsi emulation.  Adding 
the digital camera as a scsi device (probably usb storage) has moved the 
pointer for /dev/cdrom to something that does not exist. Kudzu is just 
trying to figure out what happened.

Try "ls -l /dev/cdrom" and see where it was pointed. Look through "dmesg" 
and figure out where it really is.  Modify simlinks as needed.

Other way. In my case /usr/share/zoneinfo/Etc/GMT-8 -> /etc/localtime

Yeah, thats what I thought, too.

One other thing: date --utc ==> Thu Feb 13 06:00:59 UTC 2003
date ==> Thu Feb 13 14:01:37 GMT-8 2003.  This is not the way I
understand UTC; I think UTC should be (GMT-8)+8, not (GMT-8)-8.

  That's interesting, Russell. Following the link to no-cost UNIX
implementations and clisp from Germany brings me to a ftp server directory.
In the binary subdirectory I find the same rpm for clisp-2.30 as I found on
the GNU web page. Yet, they're supposed to be different.

  Perhaps later I'll dig further.

  T'wasn't the GNU Web page I found yesterday, it was the CLISP home page.

GNU CLISP <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/clisp/> and the german CLISP
ought to be the same thing, just different distribution points.  There
is a CLISP sourceforge site too.  GNU Common Lisp, or "gcl" can be
found at <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gcl/>.

Just to clarify, CLISP is a proper name, and not used here as a
contraction of Common Lisp, i.e.: GNU CLISP is not equal to GNU Common
Lisp (GCL).  I don't know if that is the source of your confusion, but
it certainly a possible one.

  Ah! That explains it very well. Yes, I assumed that clisp was common lisp
and equivalent to GNU lisp.

  Thanks for clarifying.

  I think that I'll start learning CLISP as it will help me with elisp in
emacs, too. There's a good intro book available on the Web and the author --
Mark Watson -- writes that he finds lisp even quicker than java for
prototyping and developing apps.

Message-ID: <20030213231755.44904.qmail@web40802.mail.yahoo.com>

I recently patched Apache on my Red Hat 7.1 machine to
Red Hat's latest release:
  apache-1.3.27-1.7.1
  php-4.1.2-7.1.6

Since the upgrade, I've had problems with it. I have a
couple of PHP-based upload pages, so people can upload
files to my page. It worked flawlessly before, with
files up to 100 MB, but now when I upload a time or
two, Apache goes weird. For example, this morning, the
page seemed to work fine for my Mozilla/Linux box, but
I would get errors like "the page contains no data" on
a WinNT or Win98 machine. Also, pages would sometimes
fail to refresh correctly about 25% of the time on
some Windows machines, while again them seemed to work
on my Linux box. At other times, the server would stop
working for all browsers. Restarting Apache would fix
it, but it would usually take two tries to stop Apache
(service httpd stop).

Any ideas or suggestions?

-Scott

this is the wrong philosophy.  the point of shell
programming is to let you solve common problems quickly by
giving you simple and powerful ways of combining existing
tools.

'ls -t' is the tool that answers the question you want.  why
spend the time and effort re-inventing the wheel?  don't you
have more important things to do?

one possible answer is performance.  in general, until
something gets executed a million times or so, performance
is not very interesting, it's not worth your time to
optimize.

another possible answer is reliability.  'ls -t' runs into
problems if you have filenames with newlines in them.

yes, that's ok.  what do you mean by "better"?  faster
execution, less memory use, more reliable, easier to read,
easier to write, more impressive, or something else?

The interactions between SquirrelMail and PHP are many and subtle. In 
the [PHP] section, set

file_uploads = On
upload_max_filesize = 2M

(Season the '2M' to taste.)

I think that should do it.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0302131745490.19574-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  A couple of days ago I received notice from Red Hat that python and
tkinter have been patched to fix potential vulnerabilities. So I just
downloaded all the applicable packages and tried to upgrade what I have
installed. Unfortunately, I'm once again caught in the infinite loop of
self-referential, circular dependency quagmire and I don't know how to get
out of it. Here's the problem:

[root at salmo /home/rshepard]# rpm -Uvh python*
error: failed dependencies:
        tkinter < 1.5.2-43.73 conflicts with python-1.5.2-43.73
        python = 1.5.2-38 is needed by tkinter-1.5.2-38
        python2 = 2.2 is needed by tkinter2-2.2-16
[root at salmo /home/rshepard]# rpm -Uvh tkinter*
error: failed dependencies:
        python = 1.5.2-43.73 is needed by tkinter-1.5.2-43.73
        python2 = 2.2.2 is needed by tkinter2-2.2.2-11.7.3

  So, I cannot upgrade python because it requires tkinter to be upgraded
first. However, I cannot upgrade tkinter first because python's dependent on
it. Sigh.

  It seems to me that the only way to "upgrade" is to remove both python and
tkinter, then install the new versions.

  Without any intention of generating another long, virulent thread on
distributions, I'd like to ask if the idea of packages is to avoid just the
circular dependencies that keep me from easily maintaining my systems.

Oh, well,

Rich

I've just done this and putting them bothon the same line doesn't help 
either.  What I usually do is use --nodeps on one then install the other 
normally.

$ rpm -Fvh --nodeps tkinter*
$ rpm -Fvh python*

  Yup. I completely forgot about putting multiple files on the command line.

  Guess that's why I couldn't make a living as a SysAdmin, eh?

Many thanks, Christian, it's upgrading now,

Have you considered that perhaps finding the file with the most recent
mtime is perhaps just part of a larger program whose greater task is very
much suited to perl?

He's right that you shouldn't have to shell out for simple filesystem
operations from a robust scripting language.

Apparently, the ftp method is a little wonky.

When I do
# rpm -Fvh ftp://philo:/pub/RedHat/Updates/i386/python* tkinter*

it just grabs the python packages and ignores the rest of the line.  Since 
this is the way I usually do it, explains why I never had luck.

Another solution is to copy all the inter-dependant packages into one dir 
and do rpm -Fvh *.rpm

that does O(N log N) I/O operations.
calling 'ls -t' does O(N).
the difference is probably unimportant, unless you have
a million files or a slow filesystem.

Rich,

To get out of this loop, just put all the RPMs in a
single directory, then do this:

  rpm -Uvh *rpm

That should do it.

yes, I did.  the way he asked the question implied there was
no particular technical reason he disliked using 'ls -t', he
just wanted Purity of Essence or something like that.

sure, but why bother spending time writing out code that has
to be debugged if 'ls -t' works fine?

Kyle,

  I do the upgrade two-step rather than trying it all at once. I'll use
ncftpget for each package, then su to root and Freshen them all at once.

  Thanks, Scott. That's another way that would work. I resolved the problem
by putting both globbed file names on the one command line.

About Tripwire

Joseph Wheeler spent four years with Symantec Corporation providing
technical support for products such as pcANYWHERE and developing
innovative ways to get customers to use online technical resources. In
the past four years with Tripwire he moved from the initial support team
to a systems engineering role. His current duties take him on flights
around the globe supporting Tripwire's numerous parners and customer
base, all the while searching for the most elusive of exotic beverages.

Tripwire(tm) Integrity Assurance solutions ensure the security and
availability of servers and network devices, while enabling increased
efficiencies and control over IT infrastructure across enterprises and
government agencies worldwide. The software establishes a baseline of
data in its desired state, detects and reports any changes to the
baseline, enabling rapid discovery and recovery when an undesired change
occurs. Tripwire identifies change, whether accidental or malicious,
from outside or within, and is the only way to know for certain that
your data is safe and remains uncompromised. Tripwire establishes the
foundation for data security and ensures a safe, productive, stable IT
environment.

Tripwire software is one of the most widely deployed and trusted
integrity assurance solutions in the world. Dr. Eugene Spafford and Gene
Kim created the initial release of Tripwire software in 1992 at Purdue
University. That academic source release received widespread support and
quickly became an essential part of best practices for corporate,
education, and government security professionals. Since 1992, more than
1 million copies of Tripwire have been downloaded and over a 1/4 million
are in active use.

Based in Portland, Oregon, Tripwire was founded by Gene Kim and W. Wyatt
Starnes. A fast-growing, global technology company, Tripwire has been
named to The Oregon Technology Fast 50 list and currently has operations
in 15 countries around the world.

About PASA

PASA is an informal support group for Portland Area Systems
Administrators. We currently have members from the East and West Side,
Vancouver, and Portland proper. Members are UNIX, NT, and Network
administrators -- sometimes a combination of the three. Someday we may
get around to building some structure into the group, but that hasn't
happened yet. (Of course, there are no membership dues either.)

We are also an official USENIX SAGE local group.

Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.0.20030213202154.020b7910@www.dylanreinhardt.com>

Hi all,

This is a bit off-topic, being a hardware / physics question... but it's 
something I thought y'all might enjoy chewing on anyway.

About 18 months ago, some friends of mine got a new PC from a local vendor 
I recommended.  The display was a good quality 17" CRT (AOC Spectrum 7GLR).

After 8-9 months of unblemished operation, the display started showing huge 
amounts of distortion in large, wavy, occasionally-changing horizontal 
bands.  It looked for all the world like some kind of electromagnetic 
interference.

I poked my head out the window and sure enough, their satellite dish was 
mounted on the outside of the house, maybe 2-3' from the back of the 
display.  I had taken a different display over for testing purposes and 
when I plugged that one in, everything worked fine.  I decided I was wrong 
to suspect the satellite dish.  The problem -- whatever it was -- must have 
been the display.  That opinion was supported by the fact that the problem 
persisted when I plugged the first display into a PC back at my office.  I 
sent it back to the manufacturer and received a replacement, but no 
explanation.

Fast forward another 8-9 months and now the replacement display (also a 
CRT, but different model) is showing very similar problems and I'm thinking 
I might have been right about the satellite dish in the first place.  I 
have installed dozens of these displays around Portland and have never seen 
anything like this anywhere else.

At this point I have to admit I'm way out of my league.  Some questions 
come to mind:

1. Can there possibly be any such thing as cumulative damage from EM 
interference?
2. Could the satellite dish be a red herring?
3. Will a gaussmeter help me diagnose the problem or find a better spot for 
the computer?
4. Might an LCD display survive any better than a CRT?
5. Is there any kind of low-cost shielding I could be using here?

Since I never got that EE degree, I'm at a bit of a loss... any thoughts or 
help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for anything offered,

Dylan

I'm interested in finding a simple, text-based utility
to search for text recursively (like grep) then
replace that text with new text. I've had my eye out
for something like this for a long time, and I'm sure
it exists, but I just haven't come across it.

Any suggestions?

That sounds unlikely.  I just bet the sort that ls does with the -t flag is
not completely free of charge.  If it is, maybe we could use that to build a
perpetual motion machine or something.

You may be right that ls -t is the best solution, but the best way to find out
is to look for other solutions.  You may be prefectly happy driving in screws
with that hammer, but you might find a better way if you're curious enough to
look around.  If not, keep hammering away, after all, TMTOWTDI.

their name can do it for you. in vi:

:1,$s/oldexpr/newexpr/g 

will do it. emacs has the ability also, but the keystrokes to do so
escape me at the moment.

If you need to do so on many files there are any multitude of ways to
do this in perl alone (not to mention awk, etc..).

this should work:

perl -pi -e "s/oldexpr/newexpr/g" file1 file2 file3

or use find to locate the files..

find . -name "*.lisp" -print | xargs perl -pi -e "s/oldexpr/newexpr/g"

to apply the reg.exp to all lisp files in this directory and it's sub
dirs (the -print is optional with many versions of find).

You could always run emacs in batch mode.  Come to that, you could
run emacs in normal node.  (Oh wait, he said 'simple'.  Well, emacs
might be overkill.)

sed!

  for f in $(find . -name \*.txt); do
    cp $f $f.bak
    sed -e 's!oldtext!newtext!g' < $f.bak > $f
  done

  # then, when satisified you didn't mess things up :-)
  find . -name \*.txt.bak -exec /bin/rm -f {} \;

'course, Perl or a gazillion other scripting languages will get you 
there too. I just like sed. Seems, I dunno, Unixy or something :-)

it's not free of charge, but it's done in memory, which is
much much much much faster than I/O.  step 1 in speeding up
a typical system program is to minimize the I/O calls.

'ls -t' will call stat() on each file just once, so for a
million files that's a million I/O operations.  in contrast,
'sort {-T $a <=> -T $b} <*>' for a million files will call
stat(), umm, I think it's somewhere over 4 million times.
I'd have to go looking for the exact formula.  so if your
directory is NFS-mounted from geosynchronous orbit, then
that perl sort will take about 2 months longer to run.

step 2 is to look at memory usage, since filling up RAM
means the OS will page out to disk, which is I/O again.  if
the 'ls -t' sort doesn't fit in memory, then the perl sort
won't fit in memory either.  in that case it's going to be
better to run the system 'sort' program, since 'sort' will
use an efficient algorithm for large datasets, and it's
nontrivial to duplicate this in perl.  Or you can use
File::Sort from CPAN, but that's not as good.

> You may be right that ls -t is the best solution, but the

sure, go looking if you're curious, but this is not an
interesting problem.  'ls -t' in this case might take about
.1 seconds to run.  if you spend half an hour to optimize
it, you might reduce it to .08 seconds.  big deal.  there
are many more useful problems to solve.

hey
I've been doing a lot of totaly pointless coding lately in C. I'm basicly writing
music. I'm using a lot of math heavy fuctions that I wrote, repeatedly called in
tight loops. I've been using gcc and had been having lots of weird problems. It's
all pretty much C but I've been using g++ in my makefiles because I like bool,
type checking, etc. Often, after a fuction has been called a few(hundred?) times,
it's data/variables get trashed. Some of those being ones that are being passed to
the function as paramaters. Also lots of strange math (rounding?) errors that were
causing weird random tones. I wasn't really understanding why. I'd heard that
Intel's compiler was great at math so I tried it. Suddenly all my problems are
gone. It's fast as hell, the error messeges are great. My code sounds so much
better now. I still don't understand what was going on. My usual way of debugging
led me to belive that the variables were as they should be but the output was all
wrong, you can hear it, not good. So I was wondering if there are any magic
switches that you can pass to gcc to make it suck less? I kind of liked some of
the data mangling that was happening. I'd like to compile some objects with the
screwed up gcc effects I was getting and some without. The intel linker wont have
anything to do with the gcc objects. This has been fun but confusing. I'd
apreciate anyone's thoughts on this sort of thing.

It's been a few years, but I recall that all you needed to do was set up
the client service and run the BACKUPexec program on the server. Can you
see the machine on the servers client listing?

But still has to sort, so some part of it is O(N log N) (or worse :).

So, you either use a Schwartzian Transform, effectively turning
Perl into a "fetch the mtime once" mode just like "ls -t", or
you use a high-water-mark algorithm:

    my @files = <some*glob*here>;
    my $oldest = shift @files;
    my $age_of_oldest = -M $oldest;
    for (@files) {
      my $age = -M $_;
      if ($age > $age_of_oldest) {
        $oldest = $_;
        $age_of_oldest = $age;
      }
    }

There.  Single O/S request per file.  Just like ls -t.  Faster
than ls -t for a large list, because it's O(n), not a sort.

It's not Perl's fault that there are bad Perl programmers.

Felix, I'm no longer sure whether you're malicious, or just a bad
programmer.  The jury remains out.

Which version of Backup Exec?

I have tried to setup the backup agent on a Linux box with the newest
Windows version...unfortunately Backup Exec did not see it as a Unix Agent
in the backup selection.  I  ad it working before...it would see it as a
Unix Agent (in a previous version of Backup Exec).

I ended up making a Samba share of what I wanted to backup, and the
Windows box with Backup Exec saw it and backed it up.  :-P

Get the unix backup agent off of the Backup Exec CD, and install it on the
Linux box.  It's very simple to setup.  Just untar it and run the INSTALL
script.  It will walk you through the rest.  Then start the agent (the
INSTALL script places an agent.init in /etc/init.d I believe).  Try
finding the agent.init script.  Then try to browse to it from your Novell
box.

If you can't find the Unix Agent, look at veritas.com.  Last resort: 
contact me off the list and I'll get you a copy.

There is a degauss feature on each monitor and neither one helped.

Sounds like magnetic fields, although the fact that they change may indicate 
RF interferance.  It's also strange that it takes so long to show up.

You say the crt retained the distortion even when you moved it to another 
location.  This is typical of a magnetized crt.  Most (all?) monitors 
degauss themselves when powered on, but it probably won't help yours.  A 
good repair shop may be able to bring it back.

Don't know much about dishes--don't think they have magnets, and if it is 
just a receiving, there wouldn't be much power flowing around there.

If it's transmitting, you may well pick up EM interfearance.  Perhaps 
there's some fat electrical runs behind the wall.

But it sounds like this is a residence.  Is there a cell phone tower nearby? 
   Ham/CB radio operator?  I wonder if constant RF bombardment could cause 
the kind of magnetic distortion you see.

Never used one, but a gaussmeter should be a big help here if you have one.

An lcd display should be immune from magnetic fields.  A crt uses magnets 
internally to steer the electrons while a lcd doesn't.

Doubt you'd find any kind of shielding that was cheaper then moving the crt 
to another wall.

I'd rather have Peace on Earth. Let's not even talk about
fluoridation...

Strangelove: "Ze radiation vould never penetrate our deeeepest
mineshafts. Ve could grow plahnts, und raise animals...

Really, this was just a quick question about file operations, and I
wanted to keep it within perl.

Easy troubleshooting techniques:

Run a compass across the wall and around the area to see if the needle moves.

Use a portable (running on battery) AM radio with a telescoping antenna. 
Tune it to an unused frequency so you hear static.  Then use the antenna as 
a probe and run it around the wall and the room to see if you can find 
places where the noise increases or buzzes.

Love to know what you find.

The AM radio trick is very cool, FM won't do, but a non-
station will definitely do the trick finding RF.

I had a similar problem at work a year or so ago, every spring some of
the monitors would start to flicker, after a few months it would go away.

Half the people in the office had mini-fans mounted on their back cube
walls, which were only in use during the hotter months, everyone else
had flickering monitors. 

It may be worth asking your friends explicitly if there have ever been
any electric motors in that part of the house / lot.

Actually I've fixed this sort of problem before.

If the degaussing buttons are not powerful enough, you can emulate what they
are doing with a more powerful magnet. Get a speaker(woofer) or powerful
magnet (hardrives are good sources else Radio Shack).  Then slowly bring the
magnet towards the center on the monitor until you see the magnet distorting
the screen. Then quickly make enlarging circles that gradually get bigger
until you are making circles about twice the size of the display. It should
be quick motion but it should take you a good minute to get the circles that
big.

You may have to do this several times, but I've never had a monitor that I
could not get into working shape with this.

Cool, makes sense.  I've demagnetized many a tape head in a similiar fashion.

Make sure your computer is *far* away when you bring out the big magnet 
though!  I'm kind of suprised that your friend isn't experiencing data loss 
with a field large enough to twist a crt.

Ah! something I have experience with!

Another source of EM is the ballasts of flourescent lamps.  Some people use them for desk lamps.  I had one years ago and it slowly twisted my old amber monitor about 10? CW.  I figured it out before I replaced the monitor.  Mine was 6 or 8" away from the top of the monitor.

I don't know about your specific problem, but PHP 4.1.2 has some serious
problems.  We had problems with the session handling in it after we
upgraded (via Red Hat's RPM) and had to roll back to the php-4.0.6-14 RPM.

The good news is that most of the problems were fixed in 4.2 and 4.3.  We
have another machine where we built the 4.3 PHP by hand.  All of our code
is happy there or on the 4.0.6 box, but not under 4.1.2.

Good luck.

Derek Lee suggested I try the green output. It worked I can play a CD.
I used mixer, aumix, and found that only the volume and left/right had
an effect(still on green, which we believe to be the speaker out).
Today I tried cat something.au > /dev/audio which worked on green but
not blue.
I then tried Flash and got this:

Hi!

I'd like to use 2 wireless cards in Linux.
I can use 1 card in:
Debian Woody
Avaya Wireless ISA  Adapter
Avaya PC CARD
with /etc/pcmcia/config.opts, and /etc/pcmcia/network.opts config files.

How can I modify the config files?
I can't find the answer.

cat /proc/interrupts

   1:         10          XT-PIC  keyboard

# High port numbers do not always work...

There is a jumper on the ISA Card. I can set the DMA 3E0 or 3E2  with 
it.
The Card  works in both.


Was I clean?

Thank You

For those of you maintaining your own email black lists
or RBLs, my customers and I have been getting a lot of
spam from IP addresses allocated to rackspace.com in Texas.
I recall discussion here of using rackspace as a
co-location facility. rackspace has no database available
to the outside world to identify the IP blocks of their
individual customers (the spammers) and they don't return
phone calls about the matter.

As a result, we just blocked their 65.61.128.0/18
allocation entirely. They have other allocations and we'll
block them as well as we receive spam from them. If you use
IP addresses from their allocation, let me know what they
are and I'll white list them.

I was just reading the driver, i810_audio.c and it says:

The board has one output channel for PCM audio (supported) and  a stereo
line in and mono microphone input. Again these are normally locked to
48Khz only. Right now recording is not finished.

I don't know what PCM audio is, but it sounds (:-) like the green  one
is the only output I have. Amazingly, for something totally free it
seems like a POS.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0302141611220.23077-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Does anyone here know of any industrial applications for linux? I am
interested in learning if there is a truck scale application available.

  On the same topic, do you know of any vendors writing such industrial
applications for linux? In addition to truck scales (integrated with trip
tickets, invoicing and a full accounting package), I'd be interested in pump
and conveyor control/rate software.

  I read quite a bit about office automation applications, but what about
the back end of heavy (or light, for that matter) industry? As the economy
remains down there's tremendous potential for customers looking to cut
costs by going to an all-open-source solution.

Thanks,

Rich

can I vote for 'heretic'?

my unattainable goal is zero bugs.  size of programs and
complexity of programs are the enemy.  replacing one line of
adequate code with ten for a marginal performance gain is
not a win.

Yeah, my friend did this a few years ago--high level syslog messages
went out to a voice synth, which played over the PC speaker, IIRC.  Neat
hack; never got it packaged up enough to be generally useful and the
systems are all gone now anyway...

Hi!  I am an hp 9000D server, in rack, with a 1900kva
ups backup, and a 5 scsi drive array. I post, but my
owner doesnt have a power cord for my ups.  My owner
also doesnt know exactly what to do with me as I am
sitting in his living room doing nothing.  

I was wondering if any of you out there would like to
give me a loving home, where i can crunch data
happily. If you would like to have me, please reply
here, and have a truck/van as I weigh 800+lbs.  If you
have a hand truck, that would also be helpful, altho i
am on wheels.  

first come, first serve.  please be capable of moving
me, and willing to do the work to come get me at my
current location, as my owner doesnt have a means of
transporting me at all.

Sincerely,

a lonely hp9000D

Hello. I suspect you take 3-phase power, is this true? Do you which
d-class 9000 you are?

Also, for people interested in adopting you, d class machines are at
least partially supported under linux, primarily through debian. See
<http://www.parisc-linux.org/>.

I actually dont know a whole lot about myself.  only
charge with me living with a loving home is the cost
of plugging me in.  My ups will run on either 220 or
110 ac power.  I am a single processor, altho I dont
know exactly what speed i am.  I do know that I come
with ALL the software, on original disks, including
all applications you would ever need for most uses.  I
also come with a LARGE box of every kind of manual you
can think of about me and my software. I know that I
am partially supported under linux altho currently my
disks are either blank or in the wrong order.  I know
that i have at least one 2.1g scsi drive, I have not
opened the drive sleeves on my hot swap drives to see
the others and their sizes.  

the product number on me is a3336a. my ups is an a
2997A and my driver rate is A3312A.  My rack is model
C2786A.  My owner does happen to have a 220V cable
available for me if you have an outlet for it.  I also
come with all of the appropriate covers for my rack
and some spares.  I also appear to have two additional
scsi cards in me as well as a 10/100 base ethernet
card and I am otherwise healthy. 

Please let me know if I am wanted and loved, I am
feeling so neglected with my current owner!  (dont
tell him I said that).

post here please.

1.9MVA?!? Really? Wow, that's 9000 Amps (assuming 208 3phase).
Are you sure?

Have any pics of yourself? Or, do you mind if I come look at you?

When I execute realplay, the real audio window pops up and then I get
this error message:
Cannot open the audio device. Another application may be using it.

Anybody know what this is all about?

I am not 1.9MVA, I am 1.9Kva.  I am sure of that, i
looked myself up on the internet.  =)

You may certainly come and look at me.

When this happens to me, 9 out of 10 times I need to force Java to shut down after my browser brought it to life. I'd be curious to see if ps -ef|grep java reveals anything.

Subject: [PLUG] RocketRAID HPT372A --> HD devices names in Linux?
Message-ID: <03021600302800.03522@gate>

Hello Linux folkz,
I've gotten two RocketRAID HPT 372A IDE controllers and four hard drives.
Two hard drives per controller on separate channels.
When my system is booting it scans these two HPT controllers and sees all 
four drives.
However, Linux sees these controllers as RAID bus controllers Triones HPT372A 
rev 1, but it doesn't detect any drives connected to them.
I enabled the proper driver for this chipset in the kernel and still I can't 
figure out why I can't see these drives nether as separate drives hde, hdg, 
hdi, hdk, nether as raid devices. 

Could somebody please help me with this issue.
Many thanks in advance.
Alex

Check if you have them as scsi drives (cat /proc/scsi/scsi)
That's how my hpt372 shows up (and I had to install VIA's drivers, the
ones in the standard kernel don't support the recent revisions of this
controller yet).

Fedor,
Thank you for your reply.
In my case these drives are not visible in /proc/scsi/scsi.
It means that I need that VIA drivers you've suggested.
Could you please send me a link where you loaded them.
Thank you in advance.
Alex

Nope. In fact, it's just realplay that has the problem. I can still
play  sound using RH 8.0:Sound and Video:Audio.

Are you in KDE or GNOME, by any chance?  If so, odds are you have a
sound server (Arts or ESD) taking control over your soundcard... so
things like RealPlayer that don't utilize the sound server are out of
luck when they try and access it.

Look through RP's settings to see if it can use ESD or ARTS by default -
I don't think it can, though..

If you're in GNOME with ESD, you can try running esddsp realplay, or if
you're in KDE with ARTS, you can run artsdsp realplay... the *dsp
programs load a library that forces everything the program tries to send
to /dev/dsp into the sound server, so things without sound server
support work with the sound server.

The reason the sound server is there is you cannot, most of the time,
play more than one audio stream out a soundcard at once.  The sound
servers mix different audio streams together, turning them into one
stream, so you can effectively play more than one stream at once. 
Problems with them, however, include trying to get them working with
apps that don't support them and the lag they introduce, which can be
seen if you watch the visualization in XMMS, or if you are one of those
audio master peoples.  :-)

I use EasyTAG. It works not only on ogg vorbis but also flac, mp3, whatever.

I have RealPlayer 8.x on my Linux system and if you look at the 
preference settings under the "Performance" tab there are 3 different 
options for sound. With "native sound driver" support enabled my player 
works even from within KDE.

Looks like now you get theom directly from Highpoint,
http://www.highpoint-tech.com/
Go to support, select HPT372 and there are linux drivers there. Follow
installation instructions to compile and install it (it's open-source
driver), then when you load the module you get some SCSI devices.
I load the module through dependency order in modules.conf:
pre-install hpt37x2 modprobe sd_mod  # Load sd-mod before hpt37x2
post-install ide-scsi modprobe hpt37x2 # Load Highpoint driver after ide-scsi

so it gets loaded automatically after ide-scsi driver (you don't need ide-scsi for Highpoint to work, I just use it for my CD)

Fedor,

I've loaded this module and it's working, but HD transfer rate 
is only 16 MB/sec. There is no DMA access.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any documentation on how to compile this 
module into kernel permanently to make it available immediately on back up.

Thanks.
Alex

The source file says that it does support DMA. hdparm does not work on
scsi disks (real scsi or emulated). I have a small program which writes
out a file and measures the write speed, it shows that I get about
30MB/sec from my disks connected to HPT372.

I swear this stuff is going to drive me crazy.
Ok, esd is the right idea. I'm using gnome and I went into
RealPlayer:View:Preferences:Performance:audio drive options and selected
esd sound.  Whereupon my computer went progressively nuts, first
realplay locked up, and according to ps ax had 3 copies of itself
running. So, after much killing, I rpm -e'd RealPlayer and then rpm
-ivh'd it again, went thru the install which then locked the computer
again. Cycled this process again, made some progress, noticing that
realplay visually indicated that it was playing, but of course no sound.
Decided maybe my sound was fsck'ed, tried XMMS which was dead too. So I
killed X. Ominous quiet and black screen of mystery. But eventually X
came back and I tried: esddsp realplay which didn't work. Then tried
esddsp realplay & which produced sound. Thinking perhaps I was now
hallucinating from the pain and aggravation, I selected another
selection from the file menus and it worked. Not quite believing that &
had anything do with it I tried esddsp realplay, then realplay &, then
realplay and every **&^% one of them worked.

Not sure about the plugins yet. RealPlayer installs into netscape and I
use Mozilla, so I'll have to move some stuff around.

Fedor,
looks like it's working properly now.
However, could you please advise me how to compile
this driver directly into kernel.
This driver manual says nothing about this.

Thank you.

I don't think you can, at least not easilly. The driver is not designed to
be compiled into the kernel, you'd have to figure out how to patch the ide
driver with the code from this one.

Subject: [PLUG] [New to list] Please help - no fonts in Gnome apps on RedHat 8
Message-ID: <3E5028B7.3010600@attbi.com>

Hello,

I recently upgraded from RedHat 7.3 to 8.0 (Psyche). Now there's no text 
being displayed in Gnome apps and utilities, just GUI widgets - icons, 
buttons, (blank) tooltips, and windows, but no text. KDE works fine. I 
tried running Gnome instead of KDE once to see if that would fix it, but 
it didn't help.

Needless to say, this is a bit disconcerting, since RedHat is 
Gnome-centric and several basic configuration apps are Gnome ones.

One thing I was trying before upgrading - actually, my reason for 
upgrading - was trying to get the latest version of the Pan newsreader 
to run. It was an utter train wreck under RedHat 7.3 using RPMs, and 
compiling from source was also unsuccessful for both GTK+ and Pan. So my 
intuition tells me I'm having some sort of GTK+ problem.

Can anyone help?

Thanks -
- Andrew Heil

Maybe that should have read, "no text displayed in most Gnome2 apps."

Message-ID: <200302171219.09059.pluglist@bratgrrl.com>

Howdy gang,

What's the skinny on using RBLs? Anyone here use them? I'm concerned about 
blocking legitimate traffic. Some of my clients expect some legitimate mail 
from China, for example. It's not a relaying issue, so there's no potential 
of messing up a downstream server, just a question of possibly losing 
something important.

thanks!

I finally had to disable use of RBLs as a means of rejecting mail during the
SMTP transaction. False postives were very rare but when they happened they
were a real pain to deal with. The sender would phone somebody in the office.
They'd call me. We'd run some tests at agreed times so I could watch the logs
and try to figure out which of the blacklisted servers was the problem. Was it
the sender's own server or some upstream server at some ISP? Then I'd have to
go through the whole mess of tracking down and explaining to some admin that
their mail server was an open relay, that it had been blacklisted, and that 
they needed to fix this. (And this of course is how you meet clueless and
defensive system admins.) In the mean time I'd have to whitelist the server at
my end so the mail would get through.

So I decided to ditch all that. I still use RBLs during delivery (via 
SpamAssassin).  Along with the other filters, if spam is detected then the
message goes to a quarantine folder instead of being rejected entirely. Once a
day each user gets an automated email reporting on new arrivials to their
quarantine folder. From there they can retrieve anything that looks legit.

  I've not had any problems with the ones that I use. In a few cases -- a
very few cases -- _something_ that could not be identified was causing
rejections of legitimate incoming e-mails. I put those domains (and IP
addresses) in the postfix white list and the problem went away.

About Tripwire

Joseph Wheeler spent four years with Symantec Corporation providing
technical support for products such as pcANYWHERE and developing
innovative ways to get customers to use online technical resources. In
the past four years with Tripwire he moved from the initial support team
to a systems engineering role. His current duties take him on flights
around the globe supporting Tripwire's numerous parners and customer
base, all the while searching for the most elusive of exotic beverages.

Tripwire(tm) Integrity Assurance solutions ensure the security and
availability of servers and network devices, while enabling increased
efficiencies and control over IT infrastructure across enterprises and
government agencies worldwide. The software establishes a baseline of
data in its desired state, detects and reports any changes to the
baseline, enabling rapid discovery and recovery when an undesired change
occurs. Tripwire identifies change, whether accidental or malicious,
from outside or within, and is the only way to know for certain that
your data is safe and remains uncompromised. Tripwire establishes the
foundation for data security and ensures a safe, productive, stable IT
environment.

Tripwire software is one of the most widely deployed and trusted
integrity assurance solutions in the world. Dr. Eugene Spafford and Gene
Kim created the initial release of Tripwire software in 1992 at Purdue
University. That academic source release received widespread support and
quickly became an essential part of best practices for corporate,
education, and government security professionals. Since 1992, more than
1 million copies of Tripwire have been downloaded and over a 1/4 million
are in active use.

Based in Portland, Oregon, Tripwire was founded by Gene Kim and W. Wyatt
Starnes. A fast-growing, global technology company, Tripwire has been
named to The Oregon Technology Fast 50 list and currently has operations
in 15 countries around the world.

This was an interesting spam.  It had tons of these in the middle of the

Probably to defeat searches for particular words. Though I would think 
that the bogus html comments would flag it.

Actually, the point is to defect check-sum anti-spam tools.  These spam
mailers generate random characters so every or most messages are
different, so when Razor and DCC makes check-sums of the messages,
they're different.

Maybe simple checksums.  It wouldn't take much to strip these out and do 
a checksum of them.  The comment markers should send up a red flag.

Do "man iptables" and look for the LOG target.  In a nutshell, for each rule
you want to log you create an identical rule except the target is LOG.  Put
that rule right before the one you want to watch.  When a packet matches it
first gets logged and then goes back to where it was and checks the next rule.

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix Question
Message-ID: <104559012201@leo.hosting4u.net>

I've been setting up a Postfix mail server for my dad's home business and educational purposes and have been stumped with an error message I get when I send email to any valid email address.

554 <robbert at vafamsound.com>: Recipient address rejected: Relay access denied

The research I've done into the error message leads me to believe it's something to do with domains.  The server name is lserver.  I have it lserver aliased to localhost.localdomain.  The domain we have set up is vafamsound.com, but I have not set the server up with this (like I said localhost.localdomain is what I kept with the alias to lserver).

The Postfix documentation says that Postfix does not support Sendmail like virtual domains.  In the main.cf file, I've set myhostname to both lsever.vafamsound.com and lserver.localdomain in the hopes that this will be resolved.  I've also tried setting the mydomain variable equal to vafamsound.com.

What I'm confused about is what the FQDN is.  According to the book I have, "the myhostname parameter specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the mail server.  This address will be used as the default address for all local users, unless specified otherwise by the mail administrator."

"The mydomain parameter uses the assigned DNS domain name of the mail server.  You can use this parameter instead of the myhostname parameter when a mail server is configured to receive messages for an entire domain."

Our ISP (dsl-only) has their dns servers set to point vafamsound.com to our IP.  Is my FQDN localhost.localdomain or vafamsound.com?  Is there anything else that I'm overlooking to stop getting this error.  Google has not been helpful, manily because I don't understand the relationship of the FQDN to my particular server.

I hope I've supplied enough information to get some useful help.  If not, let me know.

  This generally comes from one of the UCE filters.

  The fqdn is the host.domain.tld rather than just the host name. For
example, here the mail server's FQDN is salmo.appl-ecosys.com and not just
salmo. When I installed postfix as a replacement to sendmail this tripped me
up for a few minutes.

  Postfix wants the fqdn of the mail server when it's installed. Most of us
have the 'hostname' parameter set to only the host name. Check 'man
hostname' and you'll see how to set it to the fqdn for postfix installation
and set up. Once postfix is up and running, re-run hostname and set the
machine back to the host-only name.

  See above.

  Type 'uname -n' on your mail server box and it will return the host name
of that machine. The FQDN that postfix seeks is <hostname>.vafamsound.com.

A van de Graaf and a thumbtack work pretty well too.

What is it that you want to check for?  In other words, define
"working" for your purposes.

  Is it generating ions?

  The fan and heater work, but the ionoscope I have does not detect any
negative ions when the unit is on.

  According to the Desco folks (who distribute the CharlesWater line) this
unit is supposed to sense the ionic balance of the air around it and produce
both negative and positive ions in order to create a zone of no ionization
and, therefore, remove static charges from the electronic assembly/repair
workstation. My intent is to use this unit in the darkroom to eliminate dust
on negatives when I'm enlarging them. Desco says it's perfect for that
purpose.

  Ions, such as alpha and beta radiation, cannot be detected without a
suitable instrument. They have no color, taste, odor or flavor. I want to
know if I bought a non-functional unit.

Thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <ENEFIFGGPEDGDJMEMKECIEPAGKAA.cb@onsitetech.com>

I found the only good solution for RBL's was to use one that only blocked
Open Relays. When there is a problem (which there has not been for 6 months)
I can easily explain that their server is an open relay, and I can usually
point them in the right direction to closing it.

The downside is: it doesn't block a lot of spam. Most spammers are either
moving to their own servers, grabbing dialup accounts till they're shut off,
or finding a spam friendly off shore account.

Other RBL's just give too many false positives and if the blockee is not an
open relay it can make it difficult to find the real cause, and then explain
that to the parties envolved.

BTW I use relays.ordb.org

I've used LVM on Slackware and RH 7.3 for the past year with no serious
problems.  On Redhat 7.3 there was a bit of a problem with trying to mount a
filesystem before the lvm module was loaded at boot time.  I got around it by
modifying rc.sysinit to modprobe lvm-mod (or is it mod-lvm?)  Later I had a
need to switch to a custom kernel for other reasons so I built lvm into the
kernel so that I could go back to an unmodified rc.sysinit.

The commands for configuring volumes are very easy to use.  Just follow the
LVM-HOWTO and you'll be up and running in no time.

On my 4 RH 7.3 servers I have mirrored SCSI disks and I'm using LVM for a
/data filesystem so that future expansion will be easy.  These are running in
a production system.

On my Slackware box at home I have 5 SCSI drives (in an old AT case with no
motherboard) combined to create one big logical volume.  Five drives for a
total of 17 GB and one of them is held in place by velcro. :-)

LVM on Red Hat 8.0 works great for me. I'd be happy to answer any 
specific questions, but the in general it works out of the box.

Subject: [PLUG] First bash script
Message-ID: <20030218212218.GA3562@dalsemi.com>

I'm not sure if any of you use Jabber, but the server is a little
flaky.  On startup, it looks for the presence of a file in it's
root directory that contains the PID of a Jabber daemon process,
and if that file exists it refuses to startup, even if the PID in
the file doesn't exist anymore.

So I thought I'd try my hand at bash scripting and modify the startup
script to do the checking.  This is what I have:


#!/bin/bash

PIDFILE="./pidfile.pid"

##Check to see if file exists
if [ ! -e $PIDFILE ]; then
  echo "$PIDFILE does not exist"
  exit 0
fi

PID=`/bin/cat $PIDFILE`

##Is the file empty?
if [ ! $PID ]; then
  echo "$PIDFILE is empty"
  exit 0
else
  echo "$PIDFILE is not empty"
fi

##Is the process still active?
PTEST=`/bin/ps $PID | tail -1`

echo $PTEST

if [ $PTEST ]; then
  echo "$PID exists"
else
  echo "$PID does not exist"
fi

--------------------------------------------------------------

To test this, just create some process that you can easily kill
or start (like an editor) and put the process in pidfile.pid.

The last test fails saying:

[ckuskie at nwdc_lab ~]$ ./test.sh
./pidfile.pid is not empty
29439 pts/3 S 0:00 vim somefile
./test.sh: [: too many arguments
29439 does not exist

Can someone please give me a pointer as to what's wrong? I'm sure
that it has to do with what bash expects in the conditional, but
I'm not sure how to massage it to make bash happy.

Thanks,
Colin

I think you want "'s arround the $PTEST.

if [ "$PTEST" ]; then
	....

you are currently doing something like this:

if [ 7936 pts/1    S      0:00 -bash ]; then
	... 

This may be true of your other conditionals, I'm not certian.

Put double quotes around the "$PID" in your test.

The construct

   if [ ! $PID ]  
 
is expanding to:

   if [ ! 29439 pts/3 S 0:00 vim somefile ]


With the double quotes it will read:

   if [ ! "29439 pts/3 S 0:00 vim somefile" ]

and the string with whitespace will be considered a single string.


If you want just the PID as the $PID variable contents,
then you might want to do

    PID=`awk 'NR==1 {print $1;}' $PIDFILE`

to get just the first token on the first line.

thank you.  I didn't get that from the man pages.  That is, that I should
put an additional entry for each thing I want to log.  I got that it was
an argument to iptables.  Not the case.

Even this can get you into trouble.  At QCSN I'm using the ORDB, and I
discovered that the State of Oregon's AS/400 that's used for contract
bidding is an open relay after one of our customers complained that bids
weren't getting to her.  (I also had to allow telnet through the
firewall for this customer with the state's contract system. :(

  This reminds me that the Multnomah County Library System's online catalog,
Dyna, is also accessed only via telnet. Even if you access it via the Web
you end up with a telnet session.

So I rebooted... Now I get /etc/rc.sysinit: mount command not found

Two things:

   a) no passwords to protect (at least not to log on), so telnet is
      not such a problem with Dyna; and

   b) The library has a nice(r) new web interface, iPAC.  At least it
      doesn't require local Java like the old one, WebPac.

Check for drops in ifconfig, errors in ifconfig and netstat -s and
duplex mismatch in mii-tool or ethtool. That should give you an
indication of something failing at the physical or data-link layers.
Also, the OS should, in theory, throw a SIGURG in the event of an urgent
condition on a socket so if you have the ability to trap that signal you
should be able to verify the condition of the NIC (or even the state of
the OS) during the outtage period.

Keith is is an Orinoco/Prism card? if so, you may want to convert to the 
linux-wlan-ng with their prism drivers. I have had nothing but bad luck with 
the default Orinoco drivers, and the wlan-ng drivers have worked pretty well.

Speaking of books and web kiosk systems--I was at Powell's on Hawthorne
yesterday using one of their kiosks and noticed a Netscape status bar at
the bottom, then noticed the distict Motif-style scroll bar on the
side.  I looked around behind the pedestal and found a crummy-looking
old PC.  Hmm, Linux or *BSD, methinks.  Anyone have inside information?

I've stayed away from it because I understand the LVM1 subsystem has
gone away from the 2.5 kernel altogether, to be replaced by parts from
LVM2 and EVMS.  I don't know if the disk formats are going to change or
not.  If not, I'd like to know because I'd like to use it myself.

If you've never used an LVM before, IBM has several Redbooks for AIX,
one in particular that covers concepts and terminology, which IIRC is
pretty much the same.  The other book(s), which cover the actual
commands, is very different.  www.redbooks.ibm.com

Google with 'site:lists.pdxlinux.org' should work.  Hmm... Maybe not. 
The SSL redirection probably keeps Google from crawling it.  *sigh* I
told you-know-who that it was a bad idea.

Do to the nature of my work I fairly often talk to small businesses that
need Web design and development work done. I'd like to be able to help out
these businesses out by referring them to competent Web designers and
developers, so I'd like to have a list of consultants who currently run a
small business doing this sort of work.

I'd like to maintain a list of people in this business to whom I can refer
business. If you would like to be on this list please email me your name,
contact info, the URL to your company Web site, and the URLs of a few
examples of your work. Also, please include a couple sentences that
summarize your company's strongest skills.

Some clients might just want an attractive brochure site with a few forms
and other simple applications like that. Others may, of course, want to do
e-commerce.

Thanks.

Powell's used to be a Solaris shop, so it could be Solaris x86, but it 
wouldn't surprise me to hear that your hunch is correct.

Another cool thing I saw at Powell's: a salesperson at the front desk 
in the main store was using pine to check e-mail on the PC/cash 
register.

XO Communications is a Telecom company that specializes in Business Voice
and Data.  We almost went with them for our voice and data needs until they
declared bankruptcy last year, reorganized and then were bought out by a
Mexican telecom company.  They've got a ton of infrastructure especially
here on the west coast.

Hope this was helpful.

  For a while, not too long ago, they were on the verge of bankruptcy and
allowed spammers to use their servers as long as they paid on time. I had
their entire IP address blocks rejected by postfix. They're now part of a
larger company (I forget the name off-hand) and seem responsive when I send
spam reports to them.

Here is the ifconfig output for the link in question:

eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:40:F4:29:1D:88
          inet addr:192.168.0.10  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

          collisions:0 txqueuelen:100
          Interrupt:10 Base address:0xfc00

eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:07:95:34:B5:E0
          inet addr:192.168.0.11  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1

          Interrupt:3 Base address:0xd400


So the eth1 card on my firewall is showing the errors and drops. I just
checked 5 or 6 other machines and none of the interfaces show any errors
at all. Does this point decisively at a failing NIC or should I install
mii-tool or ethtool on my firewall and interpret that output?

Thanks!

Some of my customers get about 40,000 spam messages each
month and about 5,000 real messages - an 8:1 ratio. Without
RBLs and black lists, they'd be spending their time sifting
through their in-boxes. We solve the problem of white mail
being blocked by encouraging them to feed their white lists
in advance and not waiting for white mail to be blocked. We
make it easy for them to do so. Each customer has their own
white list.

One customer decided to block all of aol.com, yahoo.com,
etc. but spent time white listing all the company's customers.
It seems to work well and the occasional complaint is that
somebody isn't able to receive mail from a friend or family
member - not customers.

Any white mail that is blocked is referred to a web page
that apologizes for the inconvenience and allows the
customer to enter a message for the admin, who then
adds the customer to the white list.

Of course, this doesn't work well where the bulk of your
communications is with a constantly changing set of
customers. You'd use other technique for this scenario.

Is vafamsound.com in your 'mydestination' line in the main.cf file?

If you want the mail server to accept email sent to a domain that has MX
records that resolve to your system, that domain must be set in
'mydestination' in your main.cf file - if it is not, you get a Relay
access denied error.

GNU Zebra is probably your best bet (http://www.zebra.org/), though I
seem to recall that gated (http://www.gated.org/) does BGP now as well
as its OSPF support.

However, BGP can be wonky enough that I wouldn't want to use either of
those in a production environment. Used Cisco 7206VXRs are pretty dang
cheap now anyhow...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0302191039020.2142-100000@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

Something strange happened and I can not explain it.
Any ideas?

My system has a file /bin/ls
At 1:00 AM last night it ran the ls command as one would expect.
At 9:00 AM after a system reboot which probably isn't relevant it
gave me a "bash: /bin/ls: cannot execute binary file" error.

I got out of copy of ls, which I will call goodls and ran:

         goodls -l /bin/ls
which gave:
      -rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root        46784 Mar 23  2002 /bin/ls
just as I would expect.  However, /bin/ls would not run.
So, I ran diff goodls /bin/ls which indicated that the files differ.
(They shouldn't differ.  goodls was a backup I made of /bin/ls a week ago.)
So I ran
        file /bin/ls
which gave:
       /bin/ls: Sendmail frozen configuration  - version &&      &      &      &     &
This is certainly NOT correct.  It should be an ELF 32-bit LSB executable.

Next, I used od -bc to look for differences in ls and goodls.
The first 20k of the two files differ.  After that they are identical.

All of this made me wonder if a cracker had gotten me, so I started
looking at other files and my log files and and other systems on the
same network, and so on.  I haven't found abnormalities so far, other
than the /bin/ls file on that one machine.

Anyone have any guesses as to how that file got corupted?
It is really bugging me.

Run strings on it and see if it is a trojaned version.  (And the botched 
it.)

Are you using tripwire?  If so, what other binaries are effected.

Sounds like you've been hacked.... Similar thing happened on one of my
machines  running an old version of Mandrake back in December.  Check
your logs.  Also check to see if any new mystery users have been added in
the last few days.

I forgot to mention, that this system was not configured for security.
It has lots of services on it, but most of them are turned off.
I believe the only routinely open ports are:

         Port       State       Service
         22/tcp     open        ssh
         25/tcp     open        smtp
         515/tcp    open        printer

Others are opened when needed.

The system is also protected by an external firewall most of the
time and this firewall is moderately tight, altho I'm pretty free in
letting ssh traffic in.  Last night was an exception.  The firewall
was configured to stop all incoming traffic including ssh.

Is there a possibility you've got a hardware problem? 

Although it sounds fishy that LS is the dead file, it might 
be worthwhile to check the HDD.

Not on Debian, but on a RedHat box.  Which version of CF are you running?

Hi,

What's the appropriate syntax for mknod to create a new entry in /dev for 
"/dev/hdc10" ?
On Tom's root boot diskette /dev/hdc8 is the highest partition.
The major and minor numbers for
hdc8 are 22,  8

Any tips appreciated
Mike

mknod /dev/hdc10 b 22 10

Generally minor numbers increment with each partition. For
hda and hdc they start at 1. For hdb and hdd they start at 65
(to avoid minor number conficts with hda and hdc, with with
they share major numbers 3 and 22 respectively).

I'm a bit afraid I have been hacked, but I haven't found much else wrong.
No strange users.  Nothing strange in the log files.  No other programs
changed.  Altho, I can say any of this for sure until I get a bit more
time to examine things.  However, nothing obvious sticks out.
If it is a hacked system, it is either:

     -  Significantly better than the other hack jobs I've dealt
        with lately.
     -  Significantly worst than the other hack jobs I've dealt
        with lately.  The hackers didn't manage to accomplish much.

I wish I was running tripwire or something like that.
Tripwire would make it easier to find a hack.

Thanks for the suggestion.  I tryed this.
It does not show a hack.

I didn't think of doing this.
The "trojaned" version of ls seems to have "2.05.0(1)-release" in the
beginning of the file.  Then it is missing a lot compared with the real
ls, and then it has lots of strings towards the end of the file, mostly

        lots of "GCC: (GNU) 2.95.3 20010315 (SuSE)"
        (Guess whose compiler this is.)
        lots of "01.01"
        followed by a few lines of symbols.

Does this ring any bells?
I don't follow security issues very closely.

I need to look around more, but I haven't found any other bad binaries
yet.

If I boot from say CD (Mandrake 8.2) and goto to "rescue" mode, I have a /proc 
directory that has all sorts of cmds etc in it. I have the option to mount my 
existing partitions under /mnt which I do. Now I look at /mnt/proc and it is 
empty. Should it be?? The reason I ask is that when I boot from disk I get

/etc/rc.sysinit: mount command not found

which then causes all sorts of problems.

I need help getting this box working, how can I fix this problem short of 
reloading everything from CD and starting all over?

Thanks

If your system uses RPM's you can use the "-V" option in rpm(8) to
verify package integrity.  (Use "rpm -qf /bin/ls" to find the package
name.)

---

I was having intermittent (and then growing more frequent) problems
with commands failing to run, and reporting that they couldn't find
glibc symbols.  

 -- Grabbed a copy of "memtest86" from http://www.memtest86.com.
 -- Used the ISO image for a bootable CD.
 -- Let it run overnight.

In my case, there was an intermittent RAM error for a couple of bit change
patterns.  Very subtle .... very aggravating.  But over 4 hours it was able
to trigger about half-dozen errors in a consistent location.  Replaced 
the RAM.
Tested overnight, and everything was OK.

---

If the actual data on your disk is hosed, then it probably isn't a memory
problem.  Another recent headache involved a Dell laptop that would
*mostly* work .... until I tried to re-install the OS.  After running their
full system diags over a couple of days, I managed to log enough
consistent drive errors that Dell shipped a replacement drive.

Mike,

    I don't know.  I have considered this possibility.
I have also wondered if I or someone else could have accidently
screwed this file up.  I mean it was late and I was very sleepy.
However, I don't normally run as root except for admin tasks,
so mistakes like this are hard to make.  Moreover, an accident
would surely have changed the date/time modified and/or the
file size or something.  Since these were changes it is more
like a hack or possibly a disk error.  I don't know at this
point.

The accidental screw up was what I was thinking.  What's the story with
Sendmail showing up when you did "file /bin/ls" ?  I know I often do things
like "ls | sendmail me at home" just to test changes in sendmail or whatever. 
Any chance you clobbered ls with sendmail?

These drops are probably caused by media errors. What's eth1 connected
to? What type of NIC is eth1?

I'm running Fluxbox and don't seem to have many of my colors. I don't
think it's fluxbox's fault but I have been known to be wrong. 

I know very little about the X Window System but read one line that said
to check this:
rpm -qa | grep XFree
It states that I should see a typical set of installs. 
But when I run it I seem to be missing XFree86-SVGA could this be my
problem, or should I be looking elsewhere?

Just looking for some direction.

Thanks everyone, that's great feedback. Now for something that has me puzzled: 
why don't spammers bomb postmaster accounts? Every domain has one. I've had 
my domains dictionary-bombed. But never postmaster.

  Now you've done it, Carla! They weren't aware of the name before.
Tsch-tsch!

  On the same thread, turns out that Linux Journal hosts their Web site on
Rackspace without problems. So, like everything else, experiences vary with
different hosts and clients.

All I know is that I don't like the Lindows distro, because you have to pay to download free software. Plus I think Michael Robertson is a smarmy, no-talent leach that latches on to a trend and tries to suck it dry. He's total 100% hyperbolic marketing. I mean, look at that page. He actually has the gall to compare a laptop to a PDA. He's a moron. Plus he compares the laptop to an iBook, but the price he lists is actually for the 12" Powerbook. The 12" iBook starts at $1000. Much cheaper.

I hate it when Microsoft lies and uses deceptive marketing to try to lure customers. I loathe it when a company does this using Linux.

My postmaster address gets bombed, along with several other system
addresses (news, uucp, operator, games). I ended up disabling most of
these so that they bounce with an unknown-user error.

Every month or two I'll get a flood of mail to unknown users on my 
system. We're talking thousands of these messages over a day or two,
where the sender is just guessing at addresses. Anything that doesn't 
bounce goes in to their data base for their own future spamming and/or
for resale to other spammers. Somewhere along the way my system was
probed for the typical *nix system addresses, and these addresses have 
been getting spam  ever since. Sounds like they've just not got round to 
you yet.

I've been wanting to write a perl script or something that monitors the
mail log and watches for this sort of activity and then blocks it
through a firewall rule or /etc/mail/access entry, though it may be
too late for my system.

I've been trying different revisions of Lindows for about a year now...  Its
decent for a newbie who doesn't know a thing about Linux, or someone who
really doesn't want to tinker with anything but still wants a computer.  The
"Lindows Warehouse" does have a lot of useful and "free" software that is
easily and quickly installable.  No RPMs or Library dependencies to figure
out.  I still prefer RedHat and a KDE interface because I feel it allows you
to do a little more with your machine, and it tends to be a little more
stable.

But, as a bundle, Lindows and their warehouse are kinda neat.  I would
particularly recommend it for people who don't want to buy into M$ but want
some of the ease of use in a GUI based OS.

As for mobilepc I haven't seen that before, I'll have to check it out.

Hope this helps.

He's comparing it to a PDA, because a PDA isn't that much cheaper than
this machine.

He might be a moron, but he's always getting a lot of attention from the
general public and advocating linux. If Lindows develops an easy way to
bridge linux and windows together for the general public that isn't ready
to use open office yet, all the more power to them.

To be fair, I haven't tried LindowsOS yet, but I'd like to take a look at
it someday just to see how easy it is to install Windows s/w on it. If I
could install all the windows apps that my mom needs for her business on
lindows, I'd seriously consider moving her from her windows environment.

LindowsOS might not be for me, but it might be good for someone else who
is ready to leave windows.

I haven't opened the box up yet, but I just ran lsmod on the box and one
driver is the rtl8139 and the other is 3c509. The 3c509 card is 10mbit. I
changed my network around when I got my wireless to put my wireless
outside the firewall. Previous to that the 3c509 was plugged into the DSL
modem directly with a crossover.

I'll swap out that card tonight.

Thanks for the help.

I understand. It's still a stupid comparison, given that he itemizes all the things a PDA lacks. My wife's Dell laptop (on which I promptly loaded SuSE) only cost $700. I also own a Zaurus. When I bought my Zaurus I wasn't detered by the fact that it didn't have a full-size keyboard, didn't have hard disk, didn't have a USB or didn't have firewire. Not to mention a 12" monitor. It's a PDA. When I bought it I wanted a PDA. When I wanted a laptop I bought a laptop. I wouldn't pack a laptop with a 12" screen with me everywhere, nor would I spend much time typing on my Zaurus. It's a silly comparison.

Actually, I don't think it does the Windows software thing anymore. That was the original premise, but I believe it either turned out to be too expensive or too difficult. Lycoris or Xandros would probably be better for a newbie looking for this kind of functionality.

I agree. It might work for some newbies. I just think the good name of Linux is being sullied by Lindows. Just my opinion.

It is possible that Microsoft will lose its Windows trademark because of 
Michael Robertson. http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/30/technology/30LOGO.html
login: secretchimp password: matahairy

Microsoft sued Lindows, but already Lindows has scored some legal victories.
 "In his order last March, Judge Coughenour denied Microsoft's request for a 
preliminary injunction in a 29-page order indicating that the little-known 
defendant had scored some points.

"Although Lindows.com certainly made a conscious decision to play with fire by 
choosing a product and company name that differs by only one letter from the 
world's leading computer software program," the judge wrote, "one could just 
as easily conclude that in 1983 Microsoft made an equally risky decision to 
name its product after a term commonly used in the trade to indicate the 
windowing capability of a G.U.I.... Lindows.com was emboldened. It sued to 
invalidate Microsoft's trademark on Windows in October and asked for a 
summary judgment."

Lindows funded the XBox hacking contest, 
http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-978957.html. $200,000 prize! whee!

But then they pissed off everyone by taking over the Desktop Linux Summit:
http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS4417146902.html

Walmart PCs running Lindows are top-sellers. Whatever anyone may think of 
Michael Robertson, he's having an impact.

I think Lindows is evil, personally.

As for that mobilepc....

$799, huh?

It has a VIA chip in it.  Read:  Cut the MHz in half and that's your
actual amount of performance.  The chips have the suckiest FPUs on the
market... I'd be happier wtih a 933MHz 386 with the optional math
coprocessor than a 933MHz VIA C3.

As for the pricetag - it ain't that great.  Here I sit, typing on a
1.8GHz Pentium4 laptop with 256MB of RAM, a 14.1" display, a 20GB hard
drive, 24X CD-ROM drive, integrated LAN and modem, 16MB GeForce2Go
graphics chip, and a floppy drive (it plays BattleField 1942) I got on
sale for $706.  I dare say, this system could run twice as fast in any
benchmark as that Lindows machine.

Then the price comparisons.... they list an NEC with a 900MHz P3 for
$2200.  Ummmm... I don't think NEC, or anybody else for that matter,
sells laptop with 900Mhz Pentium 3 chips in them.  Those prices are
*way* outdated... so much so it ain't even funny.

As somebody else pretty much said... I loathe manipulative marketing
tactics from Microsoft.  To see it from a Linux company is sickening.

Ditto. About 98% of the spam I get is from one company - optelectric.com.
It's damn near impossible to find any information on them (I wonder why?)
but I *think* they're hosted by stargateinc.com - at least that's where the

My guess is it's counterfeit, or a complete fraud. No product at all, just 
take your money and run.

Plus I think Michael Robertson is a smarmy, no-talent leach that latches on to a trend and tries to suck it dry. He's total 100% hyperbolic marketing. I mean, look at that page. He actually has the gall to compare a laptop to a PDA. He's a moron. Plus he compares the laptop to an iBook, but the price he lists is actually for the 12" Powerbook. The 12" iBook starts at $1000. Much cheaper.

If you're really interested in playing with a mini-itx small form factor
system, Fry's has a "barebones" system that looks exactly the same as
the "Mobile PC" system.  If I remember right, $199 including processor;
add your own memory, disk, etc.

If I remember right, it uses an older VIA Epia board; not the newer
M9000 with on board mpeg2 decoder chip.

I have httpd (2.0) installed in RH 8.0, Mandrake 9.0,
and Openoffice 3.1 on the same computer. I haven't put
it anywhere else yet.

I can bring it up on the computer on which it is
installed in any of these installations by pointing it
to "localhost." On OL3.1 and Mandrake, I can also see
it on a Windows computer connected to the network by
pointing it to 192.168.0.3.

But not Red Hat: "Connection refused." I find RH to be
a somewhat unsociable distribution, perhaps because of
firewall rules (which I don't fully understand). Does
anyone else get this impression?

If you accepted the default firewall set, that refuses connection to any 
server on the box, unless you specifically enable it.

This is a good thing. Deny all, allow some is usually the most secure way 
to go about it.

Assuming you have the firewall running, you should boot up the fw config 
tool, and enable connections to port 80 (httpd).

There's no way I can personally measure that since I haven't been looking
for another job. If you believe this report, there's value...

Having "first RHCE in Oregon" on my resume didn't hurt any last time I went 
job hunting.

Yes, but did it help :) and that is not an apelation that many can hold,
would having the 401st RHCE on my resume help, enough to be worth the
time energy and expense, or is this mainly a way to support Red Hat.

spamassassin v2.50 was released today. It incorporates Bayesian filtering!
I've installed it on RH7.3 and RH8.0. So far, so good :)

I think the best thing to have on your resume right now is either
"Willing to relocate" or an address outside of the Great Northwest.
Of course, that's just based on my own limited sample taken over the
last 18 months.  YMMV.

My own limited sampling indicates that being willing to relocate might
help, and perhaps certain address outside the PNW might help, it is
tight all over :)

Only if your prospective employer requires it. One IS Manager read the
certification section of my resume and all she had to say was "Welcome
to the club". However, if your looking at a certificate that carries the
letters BS, MS or PhD then your looking at something that will likely
land a job with no top-out. An RHCE alone will max out eventually, and
possibly go down, as the market gets flooded with them (a good example
of this is MCSE and CNE). I think a good rule of thumb is that if a cert
gets you in the door then it is of value, it's just not a replacement
for a degree.

Media errors (normally in the form of CRC) are generally caused by flaky
switch/hub ports, crappy cables or interference. You might look at that
before going through the fun of swapping the NIC.

I've found this to be a great tool for desktop firewall settings. Make
changes easily and immediately. Very good for quickly opening a port for
testing and then locking it back down after you're finished. And good
for the person who wants to run a desktop firewall with a lot of help
from this app..

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0302210602540.25710-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I've no idea how to solve this problem with mozilla-1.2.1. I'll add a
bookmark by pressing ctrl-d or shift-ctrl-d and it's gone the next time I
invoke the application.

  On rare occasions it will still be there -- if I place it below the top
level of the bookmark tree. The vast majority of the time it's gone.

  Has anyone an idea of what is happening and what fix is appropriate? I'm
not looking for suggestions to use another of the dozen or so browsers
available, I want to learn how to fix mozilla.

Thanks,

Rich

  FWIW, I just filed this bug on mozilla's bugzilla page. Also, despite
having added some bookmarks last evening, the file is dated Feb 11. It does
have 664 permissions.

I'm puzzled,

Perhaps try removing/moving the bookmark file and see if it adds a new one
when you relaunch Mozilla... or make a backup of your mozilla prefs folder
and move it and relaunch mozilla to reinit your mozilla folder. Then see
if your bookmarks have a problem anymore. (you can always copy your prefs
back over...)

the point of wanting to mount /proc and it can't find the mount cmd. I can boot 
from CD, go to rescue, mount the partitions under /mnt and see the data. Can I 
install a new drive, install Linux on it, plug in the old drive as physical 
drive #2 and be able to recover files and such from it?

  I don't know what a 'folder' is. My preferences files haven't been changed
for a while.

On my machine it is located in my home directory in .mozilla/
rename the directory
and relaunch mozilla.

However, are the bookmarks working now? (when you add, close mozilla, and
relaunch it)

  The bookmark I added this morning is still there when I close and reopen
the app. I've done this bookmark business before without lasting results.
We'll see what happens now.

Depends on how your system is partitioned, and what options your installer 
has. usually installs are partition-based, so if /home and /etc, for example, 
are in their own partitions, you can leave them alone and re-do everything 
else.

Yes indeedy! That's my fave method, over trying to repair a drive with boot 
problems, for me it goes faster. Doubtless our ancient wizened Linux wizards 
can surgically repair anything, this lowly grasshopper fumble and bumbles 
until things work right. ;-)

Seems like I had a similar problem with Netscape. The bookmarks, cookies,
and history data are held in memory until you exit - which is why several
of the files have the comment that says "do not edit". If I exited
abnormally the changes were lost. If I ran more than one copy of the
browser, one's bookmark cache over wrote the other's. That shouldn't
happen with Mozilla though, it's smart enough to offer to create a new set
of files for each instance.

Okay Debian deities, here's your big chance to show off. what the heck is 
going on here? A Googling on "subprocess paste killed by signal (Broken 
pipe)" returns zillions of hits, on all different kinds of failed 
installations, but not much that is useful to me. I'm just an old country 
sysadmin, dammit, not a ace kernel hacker.

This all started with upgrading KDE 3.05 to 3.1 on Libranet Debian 2.7. 
Everything else went smoothly, these two packages are stubbornly resisting, 
libarts1 libartsc0. I tried moving /usr/bin/artscat and /usr/bin/artsdsp out 
of the way, what the heck it was worth a try. Made no difference. I started 
with

apt-get upgrade kdelibs4

which went fine. Then:

apt-get upgrade kdelibs-bin

That's when this dpkg error first appeared. I resorted to apt-get -f install, 
trusting in Debian's magical abilities to fix things. Well that didn't work. 
Then I tried deleting /usr/bin/artsdsp and /usr/bin/artscat from 
/var/lib/dpkg/info/libarts1-bin.list, which did not fix it. (Hint: leaving 
spaces between the filenames makes more errors.)

I won't bore you with ranting about how installing a single KDE app leads to 
this huge ugly winderz-type interdepency mess, especially on a fricken 
half-point release. I didn't want to upgrade every darn thing, I just wanted 
Quanta. 

So- any bright ideas?

Thanks!
Carla

You can buy a professional tester like this
http://www.desco.com/catalog/19447.htm
(but who wants to spend that much) or 
make your own simple one as follows.

Build a simple Electroscope to detect the presence of a charge:
http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/electroscope.html
http://www.mos.org/sln/toe/simpleelectroscope.html

Charge it up and  put it in the path of the ionized air.
The "leaves" will start apart and slowly drop indicating less 
and less charge.

To store large charges use a simple Leyden Jar.
http://www.arcsandsparks.com/oneleydenjar.html
http://www.mos.org/learn_more/ed_res/cheapbook/leyden/ 
You could put the jar in the path of the ionized air and every 
few minutes, use the electroscope to see if any charge is left.

Have fun with physics!

Disclaimer: I don't have any experience with libranet, just
plain-old-debian-debian.  That said, here are a few suggestions.

What does your /etc/apt/sources.list look like?

You might try dpkg'ing the deb it is tripping over:

  dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/libarts1_1.1.0-0woody4_i386.deb

and see what that says.  Maybe even try some of the --debug options.

I notice that these are kde.org packages.  You might check with
whoever is responsible for them to see if they have reported bugs.

The other suggestion is to do a full update/upgrade.  I notice you
have ~170 not upgraded packages.  Probably not related, but when
debugging it is often good to reduce variables.

That's a good idea. Libarts packages are related to sound drivers, I don't 
thing they are KDE packages. But anything can happen when many chefs try to 
fix the soup.

Well, this one is a showstopper- nothing wants to install until this 
particular issue is resolved. This particular error, the "subprocess paste 
killed by signal" is quite common, and not particular to any application. So 
far all I'm finding is mysterious kernel hacker communications, and 
bewildered users with no answers.

You could try uninstalling anything to do with the "arts" package (I
believe it is the KDE sound server), using dselect would be easiest, let
it drag out anything it wants (you can get them back later), then don't
install anything else until you can run the install routine with no
errors; sometimes you have to run this several times to clear up any
cascaded dependancies.

Now go after Quanta, run the install routine until it doesn't do
anything.

Finally install any other packages (that you want) that were taken out
with the "arts" stuff.

I think the (broken pipe) is a better clue, this is the reason for the
paste failure.  I saw this error a lot when working with a SOAP
developer, it usually meant the connection to the server was screwed up
somehow.  In this case, I think it is a command pipe created by the
install script.

Good Luck

I agree with Derek here Carla. The "Broken Pipe" is due to the signal
SIGPIPE being thrown by a process that is attempting to open a FIFO (or
unixsocket) when it is not open for read on the other side. Try doing 
/usr/sbin/lsof | egrep 'artscat|astsdsp' and see if there's a process
that has these files open.

"Real" Debian, to me, means Debian distributed debs.  Once you start
mixing in other peoples debs, the likelihood of dependency correctness
begins to erode.

Tweak local name resolution. :)  Only if they require access to these 3 sites _only_ (no
other local services).

Remove nameserver entries from /etc/resolv.conf and add the 3 hostnames
to /etc/hosts (with IP's).

They will be able to hit a website if they know the IP address, but they
won't be able to lookup the IP with no nameserver entries.  They could
do it with dig only if they knew an IP of a DNS server.

Quick-n-dirty if you don't want to mess with firewalling and your users
aren't technical.

Debian GNU/Hurd, where it isn't working yet.

I've had both aptitude and gnome-apt screw things up a couple of times,
good old dselect was usually capable of straightening things out.  I
like gnome-apt's search tool, but I don't use it to install packages, I
use dselect for that.  I haven't tried aptitude much, though, I guess I
should give it more than a couple of screw ups.

Right here it's telling you that /usr/bin/artscat is included in two 
packages.  Both libarts1_1.1.1.0 and libarts1-bin.  If you believe that the 
libarts1_1.1.0-0woody4_i386.deb contains a valid version or artscat you can

dpkg -i --force-overwrite 
/var/cache/apt/archives/libarts1_1.1.0-0woody4_i386.deb.  I've run into this 
many times and it hasn't seemed to be a problem yet.  Same with the other 
error.

Subject: [PLUG] busted AGP slot?
Message-ID: <86lm08uc9a.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

My father has an Intel P4 box, with an Intel 845 motherboard (Intel
845GBVL) with integrated video, LAN, sound, that I built for him.  For
reference, he runs w2k on it, but that isn't relevant.  More recently,
he became dissatisfied with the speed of the integrated video for 3D
graphics and wanted to upgrade, so we got him a Radeon 9500 Pro.

It worked great right of the bat.  Didn't even need to disable the
onboard video.  The motherboard seemed to detect that the AGP slot was
occupied and switched to using it.

It continued working fine for a few weeks, and then he started to
observe a weird shimmer on the monitor that seemed related to getting
warmed up.  I never saw it, so I can't describe it any better.  I told
him to call ATI, which he did.  Technical support said: "sounds like a
bad card, send it back".  My father (not a certified technician by any
stretch, certifiable, maybe, but let's not go there) removed the old
card.  He mentioned to me that he had some trouble getting it out.  A
week passes, and the new card shows up.  He plugs it in and gets no
video.  Hmm.  I come over last night and have a look.  I notice that
the little retention pin on the AGP slot is busted off (didn't find
the piece, but the remaining plastic tab is fractured).  We take the
card out and the onboard video works fine, plug the card back in and
get no video: zero, none.  Two possibilities: a) a DOA card; or b) a
busted motherboard.

So, I take the card home and plug it into my test box, and it works.
So, that seems to point to option b).  My hypothesis is that in
removing the card he managed to fracture something in the AGP slot
that prevents it from working.  

And so that brings me to my question: is there anything practical that
we can do about this short of buying a new motherboard?  Whatever the
problem, it seems limited to the AGP slot.  A replacement motherboard
is about $125-$135 or so. Any suggestions/recommendations?  I've
already thought of me keeping the card, but I don't think that'll fly
with Dad.

Thanks!

You can try to fix the board, but these days it really is cheaper to
just buy a new motherboard.  Not worth the trouble to fix it.  Both of
you will be much happier with the finished product.  These motherboards
are multilayer boards and the force used in busting the old card out
probably delaminated at least a few layers.

Ask you Dad to wait for you next time to work on the systems.

Be sure that the onboard video gets disabled before you try to boot to the new 
card in the slot.

It does sound like he busted the mobo, though. Hope not.

Hello ,

I have a lot of virtue domain on my server and each of those web
sites have a number of users. I am trying to figure out the best way
to handle groups for these users. each domain needs to have all its
users plus all the web pages and emails listed under the same group so
that I can control quotas. What I need to know is what is the best way
to name the groups. I was thinking of giving every virtue domain and
it users a group name like group1,group2 ...etc or site1,site2 ..etc and then in the group
list I could just add all the user names after every group name.
What do you think all ideas are welcome

Sounds like a good scheme. Be sure to add the apache server user to the
groups.  That way the web server can serve the sites.

Two possibilities: 1) He pulled on the card hard enough to bust it off,
bending the motherboard in the process, or 2) he pried it out of the
socket, making it much easier to bust it off.

If the motherboard was bent severely, then runs and solder joints will
break.  Tough to repair, and the quality of the motherboard will always
be in question.

If he pried it out, then the motherboard should be ok, unless he gouged
it or knocked something off.  By applying that much force in a less than
perpendicular direction, he may have dragged some of the connectors out
of socket.  These runs are delicate, but it may be possible to bend them
back.  To replace the entire socket, you would need access to a solder
pot (a device that continuously pumps molten solder into a pool that is
the shape of the connector).

I'd like to see one in action, I've read pretty good things about them.

You might try using cygwin on your windoze machine.  
Then you can port forward using ssh just great.  You should be able to make 
VNC secure this way if you wanted to also.

Hey, that's pretty neat, I hadn't seen that before.

Unfortunately, though, the option doesn't seem to be availble in the
Windoze version.

*sigh*

I hate Windows.

No can do.  BIOS configuration doesn't have that option.  Only choice
is AGP vs PCI.  The onboard is AGP too.  It worked fine with no
changes when we installed the card.

Very likely.

Yeah.  Oddly, back on the onboard video, things are fine.  I would
have expected a "damaged" motherboard to be a little more squirrelly.
Evidently, there is enough continuity for the motherboard to detect
the card, but not enough for the card to generate comprehendable video
at the monitor.

Just for reference, this is the 9500, not the top-of-the-line 9700.
It was about $190.  The 9700's were about another hundred.

What impressed me, really, was how well Intel's onboard video did on
3D graphics.  Not in the same class as the newer cards, but an order
of magnitude better than top-of-the-line from just a couple years ago,
and "for free".

Thanks Sean! I'll note that for next time. KDE was so messed up I manually 
hunted down every last app and deleted it. I also deleted /etc/kde2 and 
/etc/kde3, and /user/lib/kde3. Then used only deb 
http://download.kde.org/stable/3.1/Debian woody main for my KDE sources. 
Installed the pieces I wanted, and now everything works.

A nice crash course in Debian package management, and the joy of the --dry-run 
option.

Not everybody wants to run BattleField 1942 on their laptop, in fact I
never have.  I think this laptop fits a nice niche for some people:
folks that don't want to lug around a 7 pound monstrosity, or even a 4
pound laptop.

I've got an old Sony z505 that I would NEVER trade for one of those
giant computers that happen to fold up and that people call laptops.  I
regularly carry mine around and I'm not bothered by its weight - I never
have to decide whether to take it with me or not, I just take it.  I had
to carry around a friend's 12" iBook for a day and that extra 1.5lbs
made a difference.

In the ultralight laptop realm it's _not_ uncommon to find sub GHz
CPUs.  I imagine it's because they don't have 2 pounds to waste on a
battery just to power Intel's latest and greatest.  Lindows is using the
VIA chip because of its low power characteristics too I'd imagine.  And

That I agree with, but I don't see anything particularly manipulative

Yes.  In order for the server to serve the site, it needs access.  If
you don't add it to the groups you will need to add world read access. 
This sounds like you don't want none group members to see the site.

I do believe it did. One of the nice things about RH testing and Cisco testing 
is that they are practical tests. Whereas I believe that MS testing and 
Novell testing are purely "knowledge" tests. 

Practical testing actually shows that you can do more than commit knowledge in 
a book to memory.

Message-ID: <20030222191218.M28389@laynesoftware.com>

I've been using Netscape 7.0 instead of Mozilla because of plugin support. 
The one thing I really liked better about Mozilla is that you could block
popups.  To my delight I just discovered that if Netscape and Mozilla are
using the same config directory (~/.mozilla) then you can turn off popups in
Mozilla (Edit->Preferences->Advanced->Scripts & Plugins->Open Unrequested
Windows) and the feature carries over to Netscape.  In the prefs.js file the
line is:

user_pref("dom.disable_open_during_load", true);

I wonder who forced Netscape to leave that feature off of the setup menu?

I assume you're talking GCC 2.95 vs GCC 3.2 plugin problems...

If you're using an up-to-date Moz version (1.2 or up) all the plugins
except for Java work great.  For Java, you should be able to find a
script to rebuild java with GCC 3.2 that'll fix the java plugin
problems.

I have Moz 1.2.1 working with Java, RealPlayer, and Flash... Moz and
Java compiled under GCC 3.2.  Java actually seems a bit faster, but that
could be my imagination.

That's in Gentoo, though.

True with MS tests, not true of Novell tests. Most of the Novell tests
are packed with multi-part, hands on simulated exercises that your
graded on. Although I didn't find them particularly difficult if I had
no hands on working knowledge of the operating system and it's tools I
would probably have failed.

Actually, I was referring to the fact that I've got a bunch of plugins
working with Netscape and none of them working with Mozilla.  I haven't
taken the time to fiddle with Mozilla to figure out what the problem is.
Basically, I do about:plugins in Mozilla and see nothing.

That's good to know.  When I get bored with everything else I'm working
on I'll see if I can get Mozilla tuned up.  I'm running Slackware-current
on my laptop, so I've got all kinds of bleeding-edge versions of things
that might cause problems.

I believe that when discussing tests, terms like "practical" and "applied
skills" should be interpreted to mean "things I know" whereas terms
like "book knowledge" and "rote memorization" mean "things I don't know."
At least that's how I've always used them. :-)

I'm curious if Lindows considered the Crusoe.  Before I decided to go
OSX, I would have purchased a Fujitsu Lifebook P2000.  Crusoe powered
and a nice small package.

A little confusing to you Terry? Sorry.  I think the short was that you
could read a book and pass an MS or Novell test but you had to have some
practical working skill and knowledge to pass a RedHat test. My comment
agrees with this post with respect to MS tests but not with respect to
Novell tests. 

Hope that clears things up for you.

Steve

Sorry, Steve, I guess I should have put three smileys there so you'd know

There must be some symlinks missing. As root, do

  # season these to taste
  nsplugindir="/usr/lib/netscape/plugins"

This is a very bad idea.  The problem with putting Apache in their group
is that any vulnerability in a process running as Apache (Apache itself,
mod_php, mod_perl, mod_python, Java, mod_ssl, any other CGIs or
modules...) immediately gets write access to every one of your
customers' web sites.

There are better ways around this.  Assuming they'll be getting in with
FTP, you can use PureFTPd, which will make a "virtual chroot" into their
home directories, but will follow symlinks out, and IIRC only if they're
owned by an appropriate user, such as root.  So, you chroot them into
their home directories and make symlinks out to their web directories.

Given the choice between letting people see each other's documents and
giving Apache write access, I'd definitely choose the former.  Besides,
Apache only needs world-execute on directories to get access to the
files, unless they're providing open directories.  This should work to
set most directories properly:

  find /path/to/virtual/host -type -d -exec chmod 771 {} \;

And I tend to prefer to name groups after the group, rather than
something generic, like 'group1'.  Unless you're mixing in much older
Linux systems or proprietary UNIX systems, the limit is 16 characters
(although that's only with names added with the 'useradd' utilities;
LDAP can serve much longer names, and I suspect vigr would allow you to
put in longer names too).  So if nothing else, use 'myverylongexam00'.

If you're really going to be hosting many sites, ISPMan
(http://www.ispman.org) is a pretty nice tool.  If you want to hire help
setting it up, call me :)

Message-ID: <12FFA05C.5070709@vancleve.com>

This may not interest anyone with bills to pay, but I was recently in 
Barcelona, where there is a funky little laundromat/cybercafe in dire 
need of a little networking expertise.  To be blunt, this is a poor 
business in a relatively poor area, but they provide good services, and 
they run Linux (Mandrake, I believe), so I told one of the management I 
would try to help him out.

I'm not really an admin, and I don't know the extent of their woes, but 
their network, if you can call it that, is pretty unstable.  And there 
is a problem with their printer, which I think is because there is no 
print server and their one Wintel box is hogging the machine.  In fact, 
they have no dedicated servers at all, thought my Spanish fellow there 
informs me they "used to".  He speaks decent English, by the way.

I'm just thinking this would be a great opportunity for you 
underemployed admins to practice your skills, since I doubt there is any 
money in it.  These guys are hurting for expertise, and they are open to 
somebody working remotely with them.  Probably a proper firewall would 
be a good start, which may have to be the print server as well.

Just an idea, assuming it's even possible to get things going remotely. 
  (Barcelona is a wonderful city, by the way, if you actually have the 
means to go there.)  Email me if you're curious, and I'll put you in 
contact with this fellow.

average around 690 and is complaining about having too many files

Download their distro (RH based) and follow their instructions. It's actually 
quite easy. I put up a 14 node cluster just for fun on a bunch of machines I 
had lieing around last year.

First sentence:

We are a group of enthusiasts dedicated to teaching and learning about
Linux and Unix.

The poster was getting on the OP's case about his "I procrastinated and
will flunk out if you guys don't help me" kind of statement.

Since I've been there myself a few times, I would have helped had I
known anything about Beowulf clusters (do they use OpenMOSIX or
what?)...

I think he was referring to this:

     "We are a group of enthusiasts dedicated to teaching and learning
      about Linux and Unix."

Of course, there's always the old saying: "Give a man a fish...." I
personally think they *both* had the right idea.

I am running top, which is why I know what the load average is. I
can't easily post it, as it's running on a different machine (and I
wouldn't be able to send this email at it's current response rate);
and I'm not transcribing it manually.

The things at the TOP are not the files that are causing the problem;
and the ones that are probably show up just below the bottom of the
screen.

So, back to the real question (I think): What causes the system to
think that there are too many files open? What things should I be
looking for to avoid this in the future? etc.

So, you're saying that top doesn't indicate anything that's taking 90 some 
precent of the system resources?

If that's the case, have you considered that it might be doing a project for 
somebody you don't know about? are there any users on the system you didn't 
authorize? I'd be looking to see if it had been hacked.

Si, Barcelona, Espa?a, se?or.  I was actually hoping the work could be 
performed from Portland.  I really didn't expect anyone to fly over 
there for a few days of charity work.  Some onsite time may be required, 
but I was thinking some instructions could be sent by email for any 
hardware changes, if needed, and the rest could be done just by logging 
in.  Am I up a tree, then?  I know I can rent a server in Texas or 
somewhere, configure it, and set up a Web site without ever actually 
seeing the machine or its facility; but maybe this problem is too 
difficult for that game.  Like I said, I'm not an admin.

I didn't intend this to sound like I was getting on anyone's case. It
just seems like 3 weeks is enough time to do a Beowulf cluster correctly
at least 3 times. Posting something constructive here takes less energy
than it does to bash on someone seeking guidance.

Right...  but this is a Terminal Server with many users, so I don't want

Subject: [PLUG] W2K or XP for dual-boot system?
Message-ID: <20030224090058.A31293@tpol.peak.org>

I'm in the market for a new desktop machine.  It'll run Debian 90% of
the time, but I do handheld software for fun and will need to run
windows occasionally to use the compilers for WinCE.  So it'll be a
dual-boot system.

I seem to have a choice between machines with W2K and XP installed,
and so am wondering if I should care.  My work-issued laptop
dual-boots with W2K and seems fine (and runs all the apps I need).  XP
is newer, and presumably will be current longer; but I worry about its
reputation as spyware and whether it'll be a good citizen on a
dual-boot disk.

Any suggestions or experience to share?  Any good articles on the
subject?

Thanks,

--Eric House

Win2K is Windows NT 5.0, WinXP is Windows NT 5.1 - they are *very*
similar.

Neither should give you any problems whatsoever in a dual-boot system.

XP is a bit evil with it's WPA, but if you don't mind that, might as
well go for XP.

I get a daily report from a machine that was originally a

find which program generates it. The first lines of the 
report are:

Active System Attack Alerts

from host: 75-194.kiev.dialup.ukr.net/212.42.75.194 to TCP 
port: 1080

Then after it flags all of the portsentry and ssh version 
mapper scans, it gives:

I feel kind of stupid for having to ask, but I've looked for 
this package over and over, it never seems to default install 
anymore, and I don't know what else to do but ask...

I'm pretty sure these reports are generated by a program called
"LogWatch"

rpm -q logwatch to see if it's installed and at what version.

Here's what I get:

#rpm -q logwatch 
package logwatch is not installed

I have logwatch on other servers, it has: "LogWatch for 
(servername)" in the subject line. 

These subject lines are:

servername.com 02/24/03:04.02 ACTIVE SYSTEM ATTACK!

It's puzzling.

Logcheck was it. I forgot I'd D/L it when I got portsentry. I used 
www.rpmfind.net this time.

BTW- The old psionic site is completely gone, nothing exists but Cisco error

http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003-057.html

..."When creating a user account, the version of useradd included in Red Hat
Linux 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0 creates a mailbox file with incorrectly-set
group ownership. Instead of setting the file's group ownership to the
'mail' group, it is set to the user's primary group.

On systems where other users share the same primary group, this would allow
those users to be able to read and write other user mailboxes."

Oops.

This page has lots of links for a HP Omnibook XE3

If you have a open pcmcia slot, you might try installing a good working nic, 
until you get the mini-pci one working.

XP, from my experience, is a bit picky about hardware. Take a look at
the Microsoft compatibility library and make sure your covered before
you install. The install itself will/should print a report about the
hardware that might not be supported but if you know ahead of time you
can have the current specific drivers ready for the OS at install time.

I intended mine to sound like I was getting on his case, but politely

In retrospect, a simple reply such as

Do you mount anything using NFS?  The load average tallies blocked tasks
also.  vmstat 2
The 
r b s should add up to your load.

The r is running tasks
The b is blocked tasks
The s is stopped tasks

We find at work that when an NFS server goes down, we get a lot of
blocked tasks.  Sometimes if we are very lucky we can unmount the NFS
mount and remount it.  Most of the time, though, we have to reboot.

Well, if you run a mail server based on RedHat, "oops" doesn't contain

It looks as if the problems I've heard about have more to do with the
partition type than the Windoze version.  If XP will let me install it
onto a Fat23 partition, and will use the same swap partition as Linux,
I'll give it a shot.  The WPA stuff could make for some cheap
entertainment: firewall it so it can't talk to the mother ship and
watch it squirm. :-)

The machine I wound up getting, an IBM M41 P4 1800/256/40, comes with
XP.  It's the first machine I've bought in close to five years, and
will be a fun change from the castoff PII/200 systems I'm used to.

Thanks for the help.  I'll post results when I have 'em.

Yes you can install onto a FAT32 partition... but Windoze can't take
advantage of swap partitions.  Swapping is always done to a file in
Windoze... you can set up a dedicated FAT partiton to contain nothing
but a static swap file if you want... but it can't use a Linux swap
partition.

  I suspect that the folks at Red Hat, S.u.S.E., Mandrake, Slackware, etc.,
plus many of us here, would take umbrage at the appelation "ragtag". I don't
always wear a suit and tie when I'm sitting in front of the workstation and
not visiting clients or bureaucrats, but I don't think of my self as
"ragtag".

  Otherwise, I'm in full support of swatting that 4-color butterfly. I think
the imagery is appropriate, too: the ephemeral nature of Microsoft, even if
it does take 25 years.

At last week's PANUG meeting, I did a presentation on
the alternate DNS Top Level Domains. For those who
want to experience it firsthand, you can use one of
my name servers for a week or two that has been
configured to resolve many of the new TLDs. It, of
course, also resolves the ICANN TLDs like COM, BIZ,
NET, etc.

I don't want to open it up to the entire world so
you'll need to send me your IP address. If your IP
address is doled out by a DHCP server, give me the
first few numbers of your current IP address and
I'll open up that entire sub/supernet. I'll send you
instructions for accessing the name server by return
email.

Once you can resolve the new names, you'll have access
to the slides I used for the presentation.

There are few situations in which I would benefit from

I was able to get my USB scanner working with SANE,

makes sense.

I'm wondering whether it would be feasible to convert
the scanned images containing text from 24-bit to
1-bit, and if so, what software would do it. The only
point in OCR is to save time, so unless the process is
reasonably convenient, it wouldn't be worth the

I may use a Windows OCR program, so if the

It would be nice if there was a link somewhere on the "non-alternate" 'net 
on how to configure your DNS server to resolve the "alternate" TLDs. Then 
those of us that run our own DNS servers could also set up to resolve the 
alternate TLDs, and not have to re-configure our client machines.

I.e. make it as easy as possible to get the information.

If this information has already been disseminated, please post it again, I 
must have missed it previously.

Thank you.

I scanned the original document at 150 dpi and 24-bit
color depth, since my scanner will not work in black
or gray modes with SANE. The quality of the type used
by the writer was high but not superb.

I used Irfanview under WINE to reduce the color depth
to 1 bit. I then used a Windows OCR program under WINE
to obtain the results below (!!!). If you type like I
do, OCR is still worth doing this way.

Ed's original post got me thinking so I went a-lookin' and found the
infomation but since we're getting him to come and do a DNS Boot Camp in
Spokane I haven't worried about it since then.  My point ... it is out

  I know some of you are successfully running dosemu. Yesterday I spent a
little time trying to get it running again here and made some progress.
However, when invoking the emulator I now get continuous error messages
writing to the screen.

  Below is the response I sent to the linux-msdos mail list and an
individual who offered some thoughts last month. If anyone here has insight
into solving the current error, please let me know.

Thanks,

  Progress, I think.

  I made soft links from /var/lib/dosemu/bootdir.first/ to all the
directories in /dos7/. Then I modifed /etc/dosemu.conf so $_hdimage points
to bootdir.first.

  In the QuickStart doc file, it suggests inoking dosemu with 'dos -O
2>/tmp/error.out'. I tried that and nothing happened. I was back at the bash
prompt once again. So I tried what worked before, 'dos -C' (for color). Once
again, I saw this:

  Nothing after this, so I pressed [Enter] and a non-stop race of:

kept scrolling by until I killed the process.

  Can someone please explain this error to me, and suggest how to fix the
problem?

A KT133A board shouldn't have any problems at all.  If it uses
integrated audio, video, or LAN, you *could* run in to problems, but at
least audio and LAN are generally well supported.  If it's an SiS video
chip, I think you could have problems.

Rob,

  If any of these functions are on the board, can't they be made
non-functional by jumpers? I've always been leery of putting all my eggs in

Generally they can be jumpered off, turned off in the BIOS, or (in the
case of integrated video, anyway) automatically turn off when whatever
the component is is plugged in to the board.  ie; integrated video goes
off when you plug in an AGP card.

Rob,

  That's what I thought. My systems are several years old and I don't keep

Subject: [PLUG] Most effective way to count tar files on tape
Message-ID: <ENEFIFGGPEDGDJMEMKECAEHDGNAA.cb@onsitetech.com>

Is there an easy way to count the number of tar files existing on a tape
with 'mt' or another utility. I have some thing in mind, but I don't like it
(it's fairly time consuming and inefficient).

Also is there an effective way to clear all the files on a tape.


My Situation:
I am writing a set of files to a SCSI multichanger tape drive on a daily
basis. I switch tapes on a weekly basis. Once I cycle through all the tapes
I would like to blank the previously written to tape since most likely the
new archive will over write the BOF marker for the second set which will
confuse who ever is restoring from that if they do so before the entire tape
is rewritten.

Also I would like to track the file number of a particular archive, but I
can not do that without a count (without ensuring that backup program always
runs everyday at the same time and the beginning of the cycle always happens
on a Sunday - which as you can understand is impossible :( ).

Thanks,

Christian

I think in this context "ragtag" means an odd collection - not an
indication of poverty or poor dress. Unfortunately, I can't find a
dictionary to support me on that. It's also a StarWars reference.

Where is the Star Wars reference?  I know that in the opening monologue

Lorn Green also used "ragtag" in reference to the fleet of ship fleeing the 
Cylones in the intro to "Battlestar Galactica".

Once again, I'm having trouble searching the archives- I've been using google and 
making it search only pdxlinux.org, but that doesn't work for me anymore with all 
of the new documentation on the site. Can anybody tell me if the mail archives 
are in a certain place on the server?

I'm looking for the command to list open ports on a server, I know that most of 
you know it, it's been written in many posts.

First you'd want to read the book of Genesis, from the Jewish
Torah/Christian Old Testament, so you would know the origins of
Grendel.  There are probably earlier works from which these are derived,
but I don't know them.

Rich,

I'm pretty partial to the Athlon XP 1800+.  It runs at
1538MHz, but performs like an Intel 1800MHz processor,
if you believe the marketing.  

But the processor is fast, reliable, and I've had no
problems with compatibility.  And ENU Inc on the west
side sells it with a fan for $79.  Pretty cheap for
what you get, I think.

I have nothing but good things to say about the Athlon XP processors. I'm 
running a 2000+ in my desktop system, and an Athlon 1ghz in two of my servers.

Fry's continually has sales on ~2000+ Athlon XP w/ECS motherboard for $90 
and up. The ECS motherboard seems to be a decent board for a general 
purpose board. I've put a few of those in systems, although I do have a 
Soyo KT333 in my workstation.

I've been using their Athlon XP cpu's.  Better performance than Intel P3

Message-ID: <20030227012453.GA18871@lnx2.labnet>

Buried in the daily barrage of PR and FUD being spewed forth daily by
the Information Technology (IT) industry are what I considers a few
kernels of truth and gems.  

An easy way of keeping up to date is to regularly visit the ITnews
Weblog (http://itnews.johntelford.com).  This local ad-free site
provides daily coverage of Linux and many other technologies.

I've been busy building ITnews and publishing articles since creating it
2 months ago.  There are 600 published articles and commentary.  Each
article contains links to the original story and Web site.  Material for
articles is coming from hard copy industry publications and from 50 IT
news sources syndicating 6,000 stories.

Finding something of interest in the 600 published articles is a simple
matter when using the Article Search facility.  You can read articles
posted on any day or month.  The ITnews home page contains articles
posted during the last week.

I hope you enjoy reading ITnews.

You guys are right. There are plenty of references to ragtag groups on the
StarWars web pages, but BG was the prime reference. I bow before your

I think it's looking for the X11 devel libraries which are always (?) needed 
to build X apps.  In my distro, it's part of the XFree86-devel package.

Is there any medium besides paper that you trust for long-term data storage? 
Seems like looking beyond five years gets iffy. What about 10-30 years? Which 
still isn't that long, compared to books and magazines. 

Seems to me any magnetic media, such as tape and hard drives, are inherently 
risky. Optical disks might last longer, assuming the means to read them

spontaneously delaminate, mark my words, and then you'll be sorry!" I have 
five-year old CDROMs that still work, my precious Quake and DOOM cds.

I recently went back to 10-14 year-old floppies (720k 3.5-inchers) and
could read all but 3 out of about 200 (I am not sure the failure rate
was any better at the time!).  I could read all of my 5.25-inch 360k
floppies from the mid-1980's, nearly 20 years old.

Probably a good strategy is to periodically flip the data onto new
media, and not rely on dusty backups whatever their media.  I am
inclined to make archive copies, but keep hot ones on a hard disk
too.  Write down md5sums (or whatever) in a log book for comparison.

Carla,

  I am not an expert on the subject of archival permanence of data and
records. But, everything I've read from those who are experts suggest that
the answer to your question is, "no". We all know what happened to the 8"
floppy disk (and the 5.25" one, too) and the early WORM drives. Not to
mention the Cauzen strip reader and the 1/2" mag tapes on large, open reels.

  More recently (within the past month) I have read that while
commercially-burned cdroms may last quite a few years (if the readers are
still available then), home-made ones don't. I don't think it's a
delamination problem but the shallowness of the pits from the low power
lasers used to burn them. And the re-writable disks are even worse.

  There was a detailed examination of this issue in the last Technology
Quarterly published by "The Eonomist". Among those who know there is great
concern that the Smithsonian, Library of Congress and other archival
institutions are making digital copies of irreplaceable documents then
destroying the originals.

  Paper, on the other hand, will last forever if kept dry and unburned. Go
to your local landfill and you can find newspapers from 50 or more years ago
that are still readable. And we have photographs from 150 years ago that
show no signs of deterioration.

  If it's _really_ important, print it on quality paper and file it away.

Random seg faults are probably a memory problem.  They tend to show up during
compiles because you have lots of pointers and a bad bit in a pointer tends to
point to somewhere it shouldn't.  Have a look at this page:

http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/

Memtest86 is a decent tool for testing memory.  I had a system with bad memory
that I fixed with the BadRAM kernel module, but with the price of memory these
days, it's probably not worth the hassle.

Tom's Hardware benchmarked 65 processors and posted the results last week in 
this article

http://www.tomshardware.com/cpu/20030217/index.html

Each successive Athlon represents a reasonable gain over the previous model 
until the 3000+, which really isn't much better than the 2800+ and can't be 
overclocked much.  Tom's results and a price list from your favorite vendor 
should give you a quick assessment of bang-for-the-buck.

You might also want to look at their review of the 3000+, which is available 
at

http://www.tomshardware.com/cpu/20030210/index.html

Tom's is generally a fan of AMD but points out that the Athlon has had a 
longer lifespan than any other modern processor and it is past time to move 
to the 64-bit Opteron or Athlon 64, which are expected to hit the shelves 
before mid-year and in the fall, respectively.  See the AMD processor roadmap

http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_608,00.html

for more information.  So, no current Athlon is bleeding edge, unless you mean 
bleeding in a financial sense.

Enjoy!

Mark

I studied this issue a while back for a customer. I did
some informal testing as well. I had an extensive library
of diskettes that was indexed with a database so I knew
when the diskette was placed in the library. I noticed
that errors started occurring in diskettes that were over
6 years old and by 10 years the failure rate was nearly
50 percent. At 15 years, the majority of the diskettes
were unreadable.

My old 9 track tapes were still readable after more than
10 years - just in time for them to become obsolete.
I have spools of punched paper tape whose holes haven't
yet grown in, so they're still readable but I sold my last
paper tape reader a few years ago.

I now archive to optical media and I've put two new CD-ROM
drives in storage for the future. My archives tend to be
cumulative - I'm backing up the same old data along with the
new data simultaneously, so the age of the media is not as
critical. If I were not able to do that, I'd make copies of
my archives every decade or so.

  The primary use of the system determines what processor is most
appropriate. For writing, accounting, spreadsheets, e-mail and other
user-bound work the cpu speed and bit size is not terribly important. For a
machine on which I would be running spatial and
hydrologic/hydraulic/sediment transport models or fuzzy decision support
models I could justify a fast, 64-bit, multiple-cpu configuration. Actually,
for the low-end stuff, the current (~5 year old) PII/333MHz system is plenty
fast.

Thanks to everyone who responded to the survey. I've
analyzed about 20 ISPs. The results show that about
75% of them have their customers resolve names using
their authoritative name servers. The problem with
this is the risk of cache poisoning, which has been
a problem with BIND and some claim with Windows 2000
DNS as well.

It seems that it would be wise to run your own DNS
as long as you don't do the same thing the ISPs are
doing.

change for the sake of change?

This sounds like a customer of mine who wants to update his systems
because they're "old". They still work great and there's no
indication there's a capacity or speed problem.

Unless the application is threaded or otherwise takes advantage of SMP,
the multi-cpu route won't help much.  However, the good news is that
you can buy used rack mount hardware like the Compaq Proliant 1850L
(512 Mb memory, Raid, Dual PIII-700 MHz Xeon server processors) for
about $1K on ebay, and there are quad boxes every once in a while for
more.  If your PII/333 is okay for the slow stuff, then one of those
might be a good buy.

But do not even the BIND docs say to do this? Why yes, they do:
http://www.isc.org/tn/isc-tn-2002-2.txt

"1.3. Security Considerations -- Although BIND can provide both functions
   (authoritative and non-authoritative) in single instance, ISC recommends
   always separating these two functions.  In other words, you should run
   one server for your authoritative zones, and another that caches non-
   authoritative data.  Reasons include:

   -  Authoritative and non-authoritative data are served to different sets
      of clients.  In order to serve authoritative data to the Internet,
      the nameserver must be outside any firewalls.  However, caching
      nameservers should generally be placed inside firewalls to protect
      them from outside abuse."

So if DNS admins are following instructions, what's the problem?

Carla,

    This is a topic that I could go on about for quite some time, but ...
I recommend clay or stone tablets.  We have and can read clay and stone
tablets that are thousands of years old.  Of course, you may prefer paper.
Paper is easier to use and works pretty well depending on how the paper
was created and how careful you are storing it.  The dead sea scrolls
from around the time of Christ are in pretty bad shape, but we can read
many of them.  In more practical terms, my family has books, letters,
and photographs dating back to 1870 or so.  In most cases, the paper has
lasted quite well but the book bindings have fallen apart and the images
on the letters and photographs have faded.  Moreover, the letters are a
bit difficult to read, because of the languages and hand writing styles
used.  The photographs have lost value due to lack of meta data.
In other words, no one is still alive who knows who was photographed.

    Modern digital media is very bad in terms of long term storage.
As libraries, historical societies, and other institutions become
more and more digital, we are storing more and more of our culture
on transient media that requires constant maintenance by highly skilled
people.  If something happens in our society (war, economic depression,
total social chaos, etc) and we have to mothball everything for a
generation or two, we risk losing a lot of information of cultural
importance.

    In practical terms, we have to use digital media for many many things
and I wouldn't trust any digital storage system for more than about five
years.  Media breaks down.  Formats change.  Software to read
the data change.  Interfaces change so old tape drives or card readers
or whatever become unusable.  I have seen a lot of data lost due to
factors of this sort.  One really has to maintain data constantly
(at least once every five years) or it goes away.

I'm currently looking at some old nine track tapes.  One of them is dated
June 19, 1979.  The tapes have not been stored in good facilities; but
surprisingly I have been able to read most of them without error.  On
the other hand, this doesn't do much good since many of them are in a
variety of proprietary CDC or Prime or DG formats.  However, it has
been fun.

This advice from ISC is recent. No such advice existed two years
ago even though cache poisoning was known to be a problem before
then. I don't think O'Reily's DNS and BIND book mentioned this in
it's first edition (Cricket added it to the second edition released
last year). Many DNS admins learned their craft from this book
(first edition). I haven't researched whether Microsoft mentions
this in their documents.

A rhetorical question? :-)

A few things to think about:

If ISC recommends that you ALWAYS separate these two functions,
why does BIND combine both functions in one program?
If your answer is that it's legacy - that early design didn't
consider cache poisoning, why then does BIND 9 - a recent total
rewrite of the code - continue to combine the functions?

Why is there only one UDP port for the DNS protocol, thus
preventing both functions to be running in their own daemons
on the same computer?

Message-ID: <200302271252.40500.mmartin@u.washington.edu>

I guess I wasn't clear when I said "it is past time to move to the 64-bit 
Opteron or Athlon 64".  What Tom's Hardware meant (and what I garbled in my 
message) was that they think that it is time for AMD to release their 64-bit 
processors.  Whether or not you purchase them is up to you.

I personally would like to "move to the 64-bit Opteron of Athlon 64", which 
for me wouldn't just be change for the sake of change.  I have calculations 
that I would very much like to do that would currently take more than a month 
using my current (6-year-old) hardware.  This is too long to be practical.  
But, in any case, I wasn't making a suggestion regarding what Rich should 
purchase, only supplying information to help him and others make their own 
decisions.

I could take full advantage of a system with as many 64-bit, high-clock-speed 
processors as I could muster and there are other people in this category as 
well.  But, even for someone with my processing requirements/ambitions, the 
typically nonlinear relationship between price and processing power means 
that investing in a larger number of older, lower cost, lower power 
processors generally makes more sense (assuming that you can parallelize your 
application in a reasonable way).  Of course, the requirements on the typical 
server or workstation are much, much lower and buying the latest and greatest 
for the typical server or workstation is completely superfluous.  Purchasing 
should always be done in light of current and future requirements, capacity 
planning, and budgeting.

Tom's point was that, as far as the cutting/bleeding edge goes, the Athlon has 
reached the end of it's lifespan.  The architecture is over 5 years old and 
has reached the point of diminishing returns with respect to performance 
gains.  The Athlon is a great architecture, which is why it has been so 
durable and extensible, but AMD has been delaying their next generation 
products so they can milk every last dime possible from the 32-bit Athlon.  
This has made business sense but is making less and less sense as Intel 
pushes the envelope further and further.  According to what I've read, it 
seems that the primary thing keeping the Athlons competitive (on the high 
end) right now are the shortcomings in the chipsets supporting the P4's, 
which prevent systems from taking advantage of the full capacities of the 
P4's.  Another attractive feature for some of us is AMD's continued support 
of multiprocessor architectures.  If AMD released their next generation 
processors, it would benefit people who purchase processors at all points 
along the cost spectrum since decreases in the prices of lower-end processors 
almost inevitably accompany the release of more powerful processors.

Sorry for the confusion,

Mark

Cool.  I just happened to run across a box of old eight track tapes from the
late seventies.  Let's see, I've got Rush, 2112.  Dark Side of the Moon.  King
Crimson, Red, that's a good one.  Creedence Clearwater Revivals's Greatest
Hits.  Unfortunately, the engine in my 1974 Duster siezed up and I had to junk
it.  Haven't had an eight track player since then.  Bummer.  Party on, dudes.

Yummy! Though I'd hate to think of all the end-track/begin-track 
overlaps there'd be on 2112. Wouldn't be a problem with Creedence, 
though: unlike Peart & crew, Fogerty liked to keep his songs short.

You might want to be careful about your definitions, as disaster
recovery can mean very different things to different people.
I've not be directly involved in the process, but for a medium to large
sized organization, auditors have specific requirements for the whole
disaster recovery thing that are along the lines of being able to continue
business operations within X number of hours of Portland being off the map.

So even a DR facility on the West Coast is too close for them.

Subject: [PLUG] Mail Network Options
Message-ID: <33205.63.105.27.245.1046384461.squirrel@skua.ahapala.net>

A client of mine is putting in another office location and I am to put in
a server there. Right now they only have one office (we'll call it
office1) with a fixed IP and their mail and website are on the
server(server1) there. I will be installing server2 in office2 on it's own
fixed-IP DSL line. I'm exploring the different options for delivering mail
from server1 to server2.

1) First thought was to just put .forward for each user to send the mail
to user at new.ip and setup postfix to accept mail to the IP. For office2 to
add a new user, they would have to add the user into server1, add a
..forward, and add the user to server2. Of course, if server1 is
inaccessible office2 doesn't get their mail.

2) Don't do the .forward routine and just have all mail that doesn't have
a user on server1 forwarded to the server2 and then bounced if there is no
user. This is easier maintenance-wise but has the same fault of server1
going down.

3) Set up the upstream DNS MX records to point server1.domain.com to one
IP and server2.domain.com to the other IP. This avoids the server1 link
problem. My question is whether or not the users could still have
user at domain.com addresses at the office2 location or would they have to
have user at server2.domain.com as their addresses. I'm guessing that they
would have to be user at server2.domain.com.

This is my first dealing with multiple physical locations under the same
domain so I'd like to get more input on how this is normally done and
whether there are other (probably obvious) options out there that I need
to look at.

Thanks,
Keith

Our goal is to have procedures in place so that we can quickly recover from
some event that negatively impacts our ability to do business. It might be
downed phone lines. It might be that our Internet access has been
temporarily cut off. Or it might be that our building was kidnapped by
aliens over the weekend as a prank.

We need to be able to get business up and running in the shortest, most
cost-effective timeframe.

As far as DR facilities in Portland being "too close", if anything happened
to our building that also affected some hotsite in another part of the metro
area, then we'd probably be dead, and it wouldn't matter.

So, I'm looking for something in the Portland area :P

And that's probably perfectly fine for your needs. I just wanted to point
that for anyone who is doing DR and may need to satisfy formal audit
requirements, it's a whole different story.

Actually, I may have a couple seven track data tapes around someplace.

These were a lot like nine track data tapes, but predate them.  They
go back to the 1960s and 1970s when many computers used 6 bit bytes.

I do recall, someone approaching me in the mid 1980s with a set of
seven track tapes they wanted to read.  At that time, I had a lot of
trouble finding a seven track tape drive to read the tapes.  I finally
found one in Michigan and gave the potential client a quote.
This was more money than the client was able to spend on the project.
However, they said they did want to recover the data and would look
at the project again in a couple years when funding was better.
I never heard from again.  I suspect the data is still being stored
on those seven track tapes somewhere.

                                          Sincerely,

because of their immense size (heh, on the order of 100 megabytes

something they called "square tapes", and did all their analysis on
big-iron timesharing systems with SAS.  We shopped around for a

about $1500 or so to make three copies of 5 9-track reels, and that

us.

The other little anecdote about the data conversion, when the other

center account money _just doing a frequency count_ of the data, one
pass through.  They were amazed I was doing this on a PC, probably a
crappy old 20MHz 80386 at the time.

It may be a bit more than you're prepared to do, but the best solution
is to set up an LDAP directory which contains the mailbox routing
information at one site and replicate it to the other site.  You put in
MXs for both servers and let the servers figure out where to deliver it
locally.

You could do a poor-man's version of this with a virtual or canonical
maps and rsync or scp the configuration between the servers.

Well, I got Microsoft Office installed in Linux this
afternoon, and went on to the plugins. Windows Media
Player seems to work fine in Netscape, but when I use
it in Internet Explorer, which should be its normal
environment, it complains that it can't find some kind
of "codec," and I have to kill it. I doubt that I'll
use MSIE very much, but this behavior is puzzling to
me.

  Other than the error about all FOSS being in the public domain (hack

Right on both counts, that would be a much better solution and it is more

Dave Poirier and I talked to to the article's author for 20 minutes a 
couple weeks back about the K12LTSP lab we put in over the winter holiday.

Our middle school students are rapidly getting proficient w/ OpenOffice, 
Mozilla, et al.

Being able to reuse stacks of donated Pentiums as terminals has been 
great. Our other schools are interested in deploying K12LTSP labs also. 
A big thanks to Eric and Paul for all of their hard work.

Russell,

    Your posting brings back many fond memories of floppies and
tapes of all sorts - even paper tape.  And of projects where one
hoped to process a tape per day and the total number of data tapes
was in the hundreds.

    For the record, I still have a usable DC600 style tape drive.
As I recall, mine will handle tapes up to 250 mb, but I may be wrong.
It may be limited to 150 mb.  I don't recall for sure.

    By the way, did anyone ever use Everex software with these drives.
The software was pretty and very fast compared with Unix drivers for the
same tape drives. The Everex system looked good and a lot of people used
it.  Unfortunately, Everex obtained their speed by accepting errors.
These tapes were very reliable under most any Unix OS, but rather iffy
using Everex on DOS systems.

                                                   Dave Mandel

Nice work. 

It took me a few minutes to debug my copy/paste line wrap problem, and
realize I didn't have xplanet installed. Even my feable brain made it
work, and my kids love it. Maybe you should put it on freshmeat, or send
it to SEUL to include with their educational work.

Thanks,

Jeff

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0302281823090.10571-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  We tried to use the second host today (hostname = caddis), but could not
get a login prompt on the monitor. The monitor status light showed red
(sleeping) and moving the trackball or pressing a key did not turn the light
green and wake it up. I turned off the monitor, then turned it back on. The
status light flashed green, I heard a relay click, the light turned red
again.

  Before concluding that the monitor died I dug out the little monitor I use
on the firewall box when rebooting it and connected that to the system.
Turning on the monitor resulted in the status light coming on -- yellow, or
receiving no signal. Tried a couple of times.

  Seems to me that the video card died. Is this a reasonable conclusion?
It's an ATI Xpert2000 that I purchased Nov. 30th last year. Could the card
have died in only three months? I suppose that's not unusual, but it's never
happened to me. The failure of the card that replaced was the first video
card failure I've experienced in 19 years of owning microcomputers.

  What say you all?

ANY hardware can fail. I usually find that it fails under stress. (Not
stress to the equipment; stress to the operators.) :-)

Daniel,

  This I know; at least with vacuum tubes it was easy to tell a dead one
(and I had a tube tester, too). From the time the transitor was first introduced
the mantra was that solid-state devices would fail quickly or last for
years. I guess I have been lucky to not experience the quick failure before
now.

  What I asked, poorly and in a round-about way, was if there was something
other than the video card that might be responsible for the lack of signal
to the monitor.

  That's why the equipment gives up on a Friday or a weekend. I had a power
supply quit on a Saturday afternoon. For better or worse, Fry's was the only
place open, they had one, and I made the trip there that evening.

  Just before a cross-country trip years ago (to go overseas for a job) I
had my vehicle completely serviced. The shop didn't tighten the drain plug
on the transmission. The plug fell out and cooked the gears in western
Nebraska -- just before 5 pm on a Friday evening. That was quite a painful
experience for me, my son and the dogs (with a car packed full for our
journey). Also, a very expensive experience. Yup. Always at the worst
possible time.

Rich,

What did you think about western Nebraska?  It's a hard land in the dead
of winter and in the dog days of summer. :-)  I grew up in KS.

Thanks,

Jim

Does this mean that you were able to get a login prompt over the 
network?

If the machine is functional other than the video console, I'd say 
your assumption that the issue is the frame buffer is one of the 
things I'd troubleshoot. Here's the whole list:

* if the frame buffer isn't built in to the mainboard, remove and 
  reseat it, making an effort to blow dust out of its agp or pci
  socket and to clean the contacts on the card,

* try the card in another slot, if possible,

* try a known good card in the slot in question,

* try the "bad" card in another host.
