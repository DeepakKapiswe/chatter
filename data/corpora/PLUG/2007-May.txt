I'm here, Rod. I don't read this list every day.
Check to see if the daemons (supervise, dnscache, etc.)
are running. Then check to see if dnscache is bound
to the usual ports. You should see something similar to
this if you use netstat:

tcp        0      0 1.2.3.4:53              0.0.0.0:* 
LISTEN      29000/dnscache
udp        0      0 1.2.3.4:53              0.0.0.0:* 
             29000/dnscache

You can also use: lsof -n|grep dnscache

If dnscache is not bound to a port, the usual cause
is a conflict. The netstat or lsof output will show
you this. Perhaps someone loaded a DNS authority
server, like BIND, on the box.

I'd wager a _good_ 380 Watt power supply would be adequate. If it is in fact
"the cheapest box in Fry's" I'd wager it's only _actually_ able to deliver
250 Watts or less of sustained power. Some PSU manufacturers (especially the
cheapies) will rate their units based on peak output, never mind how clean
or sustained that output will be.

If you want to say goodbye to power issues forever, get a PC Power and
Cooling unit. I've used them in several machines over the years, and they've
all been flawless. I see that they have a Silencer 470 available for $99.
That would likely treat you well.
http://www.pcpower.com/products/viewproduct.php?show=S47ATX

Other brands I've good luck with include Zalman, Thermaltake, Antec,
Enermax, and Enlight.

I've always considered PSU's to be the "redheaded step child" of computer
building. Nobody pays them any attention, until they start causing trouble.
A good PSU is worth investing in, and will usually be a relatively small
portion of the total cost of the machine.

The script hangs forever, I think because it's waiting for input.  But
if I run just 'set -x; parted pfSense-1.0.1-Embedded.img unit B print':

+ parted pfSense-1.0.1-Embedded.img unit B print

I believe the image has a number of FreeBSD partions within a single
"slice" (= linux partition) -- plus the MBR of course.  When dd'd to
/dev/hda it results in something that to Linux fdisk has a single partition,
hda4.  (IIRC)

Thanks for the reply Ed.  I knew you were around. :-)  I'll give these a 
try this evening.  Nobody but myself and one other have access to these 
servers so bind being installed isn't possible -- I wouldn't and the 
other person would ask me how to do it.  These are Linux-Vserver guests 
so there it could have been something that bound the port(s) from 
another guest host.


Again thanks,
Rod

I second that.  It's even cheaper when you consider the cost of the
motherboard, drives, processors, memory... etc. that can be taken out
by a borked powersupply.

You may be right about the output of the "380 watt" power supply in the
"cheapest box in Fry's." It is a Raidmax box and the PS is also
Raidmax. It says it has one 15 amp 12V rail, which isn't a lot. 

I declined the advice re PC Power and Cooling. I had a bad experience
with them several years ago on a "super-quiet" PS that was warranted
for two years. It failed at 1 year, 11 1/2 months. When I called they
said the warranty began when they took it into inventory and, checking
my unit, that was a month earlier than when I bought it. "Read the fine
print" is all they would say. Of course, I no longer could find the
agreement. But the experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I will
never do business with them again.

Instead I went to Fry's and got an Antec "Earth 80" 500 watt PS that
has two 18 amp 12 volt rails. It is installed and seemed to be working
fine, but I couldn't do any formatting to put it through its paces
because of another problem. The last power failure evidently mucked
up /dev/md1, which has the OS on it. It gets to the point where Grub is
supposed to say things like "stage 1.5," and then it just hangs with
the word "Grub" at the bottom of the screen. 

I tried the GRML rescue CD that I downloaded the other day on the
recommendation of Michael M. It has mdadm and finds the md devices on
booting. I started with e2fsck on /dev/md1 and it announced that it had
been 47,719 days since it was last checked and that its last write time
was in the future (fix, y/n?). I told it to go ahead and it proceeded
to check the whole thing. It finished without any other errors. I did
the same thing for /dev/md2 and got the same results.

Then I tried /dev/md3. This is the one where I know the array is broken
-- one of its two drives doesn't show up in cat /proc/mdstat. E2fsck gave
me more serious error messages and I told it to go ahead and fix
things. Eventually it got to the point where it needed to restore the
file system on /dev/sdb4. I told it to go ahead and it proceeded to
start formatting sdb4. About one minute into the process and I was
staring at a black screen again. No power.

So I got up, made sure that each of the 320 GB Sata II drives was on a
different rail, and restarted. I got to the formatting part and, once
again, after about a minute the machine shut down.

The only items in this computer are two 320 GB Sata II drives, on AMD-2
4600 64-bit CPU and two DVD drives. No video card. No network card. I
use the video and network on the motherboard. There is nothing else in
the computer. 

Surely two 18 amp 12 volt rails should be adequate. Obviously something
else is going on. It always and only happens when I try to format the
250 GB partitions. Software issue? Something shutting down the computer
if it thinks someone is formatting a drive? Bug in fsck? Bad hard drive
(brand new, Western Digital Caviar)? Feed caviar to the drives?

This sounds a *little* like an overheating thing, but that's really a
long-shot.  I don't know of many things that will intentionally make a
computer go black like that.  Generally this would be almost certainly
be accompanied by some form of beeping, hopefully from a small
on-board speaker (not the pc speaker, or not *just* the pc speaker),
but if for some reason the speakers are borked, this could be the
reason...

Anyway, just throwing that out as something to check.  Pop into your
bios and see what the thermal alarms are set to, and maybe tweak them
down a *lot* and see if the same thing happens under a controlled
test.

Temperature is a good idea. However, checking the BIOS, I'm pretty sure
it is not the problem here. The BIOS page for PC Health says:

Shutdown Temperature	80C
Warning Temperature	75C

And then it displays the current stats, changing them while I watched
(I put the range next to the item)

CPU T Control			39-43C
System Temperature	40C
CPU fan Speed		1003 - 1054 RPM
System Fan Speed		0 RPM 
CPU Vcore			1.28V
VDIMM				1.87V

The system fan speed is 0 because it is mounted on the side of the case
and the side of the case has been off for days. In other words, small
animals could move in and nest.

However, the one thing of interest that is not listed is the temp of
the hard drives. I don't think there are any sensors on them. They are
warm to the touch, but not unpleasantly so. 

More to the point, the problem happens always and only about a minute
after starting to format the 250 GB partitions, and it occurs exactly
the same way whether the system has been running all day or has been
shut off and is dead cold.

I think we have to rule out heat.

I'm also leaning against a bug issue. It is certainly possible that
something in that messed up /dev/md3 could be so broken that it sends
e2fsck into a tizzy. But if there was a bug in e2fsk it should cause a
kernel panic and hang the computer, or puke up a screenful of error
messages and abort. I've never heard of a software bug that could
summarily power down the computer.

If it were the CPU I'd be having problems all over the place.

I think the only hardware left to consider are the hard disks. Is there
any software that will scan them to see if there are any physical
defects?

Subject: [PLUG] printing to CUPS server under Debian Etch
Message-ID: <20070502021834.GZ2770@amethyst.spiritone.com>

I have an old Dell attached to a laser printer running CUPS as a print
server.  It's worked well for several years.  This weekend I got a new
hard drive for my main desktop and installed Debian Etch (replacing
Debian testing).  In the process cupsys-client stopped including
/etc/cups/client.conf.  And printing stopped working.  I gather I'm
supposed to use lpoptions or lpadmin to set a default printer, but
couldn't get anything to work.  Eventually I just stuck my old
client.conf file back and all's well, but I'd like to do it the right
way.  Anybody been through this?

I'm not using Gnome or KDE, BTW, so I don't get any cute printer
config GUIs.  All the online how-tos seem to assume that you're using
KDE/Gnome *or* that your printer has an ethernet port itself.

Thanks,

--Eric

Try doing some other I/O intensive thing, like "cat /dev/zero > zeroes.dat"
or something similar to workout the HDD. Perhaps it is a heat issue, but
it's not in the CPU, but rather the drive controller on the Southbridge...

Download the Ultimate Boot CD and run MHDD on the drives (hard disk tools,
4th or 5th page, item F5. Once in MHDD, select your drive and hit F4 to
bring up the scan option window and then hit F4 again to start it) as that
will certainly work them out in a way completely isolated from your
potentially questionsable system image.

Odd.  I don't have a BSD disk image handy, but I do have one of an OS X
drive.  Running an older version of parted on it returns this output:

With newer versions of parted, you can specify the unit size in bytes.
By knowing the start and end byte-count you can use dd to extract the
partition out of the disk image file, or mount it via the loop-back
device with an offset value.

Since parted didn't work, the next thing I'd try is to dd the image to a
real drive and then to dd just the partition you need to a file.

I need help with a SuperBlock problem.
My White Box Linux system won't boot because it indicates a problem with the
SuperBlock on my root partition.
It suggests running e2fsck b=xxx on the partition containing my root (/).
I have successfully run e2fsck using b=32768, but it still refuses to mount
/ during boot.
I have run mke2fs -S on the partition, followed by a e2fsck.
Still no joy. Same error message
I have booted Knoppix and can mount the partition without a problem.

Suggestions on where to go from here?

Thanks in advance.

As crazy as it might sound, you may want to make sure your White Box
is loading the appropriate kernel module(s) to enable disk access
(namely, the ext3 module, plus any lower-level disk access drivers
like libata).  I'll bet that knoppix is loading the necessary drivers,
and an lsmod will reveal all.

Once booted under knoppix, you could chroot to your root filesystem
and build a new, custom kernel that has all the necessary drivers
compiled into the kernel image, avoiding the module issue altogether.
It's nice to avoid having to troubleshoot initrd images.

If what you say is true, then instead of rebuilding the kernel, I should be
able to boot an earlier working version of the kernel.
I have tried booting with the two preceding kernel versions.
I get the same result.

I am getting puzzling results from e2fsck:
    root at Knoppix:~# e2fsck -p -b 32768 /dev/hda2
    /: Truncating orphaned inode 18230 (uid=99, gid=99, mode=0100544,
size=52)
    / was not cleanly unmounted, check forced.
    /: 349842/2692800 files (2.6% non-contiguous), 3621197/5382720 blocks
    root at Knoppix:~# e2fsck -p -b 32768 /dev/hda2
    /: Truncating orphaned inode 18230 (uid=99, gid=99, mode=0100544,

    / was not cleanly unmounted, check forced.
    /: 349842/2692800 files (2.6% non-contiguous), 3621197/5382720 blocks
    root at Knoppix:~# e2fsck  /dev/hda2
    e2fsck 1.40-WIP (14-Nov-2006)
    /: clean, 349842/2692800 files, 3621197/5382720 blocks (check in 5
mounts)
    root at Knoppix:~# e2fsck -f /dev/hda2
    e2fsck 1.40-WIP (14-Nov-2006)
    Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
    Pass 2: Checking directory structure
    Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
    Pass 4: Checking reference counts
    Pass 5: Checking group summary information
    /: 349842/2692800 files (2.6% non-contiguous), 3621197/5382720 blocks
    root at Knoppix:~#

Notice that the first run of e2fsck does not seem to clear the truncated
inode and
Unclean mount conditions.
Yet, running without the -b option seems to find the partition "clean".
I get the same results under both Knoppix and in the single user mode the
boot error forces me into.

Any thoughts?

Thanks in advance.

First I downloaded the UCBD and used it to run the Western Digital
Lifesaver Diagnostic tool on each of the hard disks. It ran for 75
minutes each time with the hard drive light on solid the whole time. No
errors on either disk. Then I ran memtest86 for an hour, and no
problems. 

I discovered something while booting the UCBD -- at the start it
presents a simple little word "boot" on the screen and if you don't hit
Enter fast enough it will continue and boot from the hard disk instead
of the CD. One time I was not fast enough and it booted from the hard
disk. The interesting thing is that if I just boot without the CD I get
to the point where it says "GRUB" and then hangs. But if the UCBD
starts first and then it goes to the hard disk, Feisty actually starts
to boot. It crashes to a command line, but the kernel loads.

I figured that meant that maybe there was something in menu.lst that I
could fix. However, I have a dozen or more live CDs of various flavors
and only two will show the md devices when I run cat /proc/dev. One is
GRML Rescue CD and the other is Aaron's rescue CD. Aaron's won't
mount /dev/md1, but the GRML Rescue CD will. However, it does something
weird that I have not figured out. I mounted /dev/md1 at /mnt/md1. When
I do "nano /mnt/md1/boot/grub/menu.lst" I get a menu.lst file, but it
is GRML's menu.lst -- it's definitely not mine. Yet navigating around
in /mnt/md1/ all the rest is mine, that is, it finds /home/jjj and all
the files in it are mine. Weird.

So I started downloading a bunch of other rescue CDs. So far none of
them can see /dev/md*. While doing the downloading I tried
"cat /dev/zero > zeroes.dat" and it powered off the computer after a
couple of minutes. I read what little there is in man cat, but couldn't
figure out what exactly this command does. What does it mean that it
caused a shutdown?

Being puzzled with my results from e2fsck I began poking around in the
"recovery" shell that I was repeatedly forced into at boot.
First discovery, /etc/fstab had been blasted -- I recovered from a fstab~
file.
This still did not solve the boot problem.
On a lark I attempted to run emacs ... It RAN!.
I then did a "mount -a" and everything mounted except /boot.
I then tried "init 3" and finally "init 5".
The system came up all the way!
I am still not clear on what is broken, but I will begin backing up things
immediately.  
I wish Centos 5 or Scientific Linux 5 was already out ... I would convert
now.
I think I can limp along until then.

cat just reads the contents of a file and outputs it to the terminal. tac
does the same thing but starts from the bottom of a file whereas cat starts
from the top of the file. It shouldn't have caused a shutdown, sounds like a
dodgy power supply to me.

Here is what I get (using a rescue CD):

root at sysresccd /root % cat /dev/zero > zeroes.dat
cat: write error: No space left on device
root at sysresccd /root %

It stays there on the screen with the hard drive light on solid. After
a couple of minutes, power off. I can replicate it over and over. 

My first thought a couple days ago was the power supply. But now I
can't believe it is a dodgy power supply because I just replaced the
original Raidmax 380w power supply that came with the case (brand new
case) with a brand new Antec 500w power supply. Maybe a connector,
though.

It looks like you're attempting to write to the boot media (ie CD), you need
to change directories to a mount point on the hard drive you want to test
then run the command or insert the mount point of your hard drive into the
output file name like so:

cat /dev/zero > /mnt/feisty/home/jjj/zeroes.dat or similar

This sounds like /mnt/md1/boot/grub/menu.lst is a soft link to another file.
Find out which file it is pointing to  ( ls -altr /mnt/md1/boot/grub
will tell you)
Then add /mnt/md1 to the beginning of  the file it is pointing to to
find the real menu.lst.

                     Developer and Customer Focused Tests
                                     for
                              a LAMP Environment

                                      by

                               Ward Cunningham
                                <ward at c2.com>
                 Director of Committer Community Development
                            The Eclipse Foundation

      Agile methods such as Extreme Programming (XP) rely on a
      readily repeated suite of tests to give developers the courage
      they need to continuously improve their code.

      In this talk XP pioneer Ward Cunningham will dissect the agile
      testing strategy and framework that the Portland Eclipse
      Foundation team created while developing the recently deployed
      MyFoundation Portal, a LAMP application.

      The testing framework is notable for two reasons. One, it has
      been deployed into production with the application and serves
      as "open and transparent" documentation. Two, it integrates
      with the application in such a way to make it both simple and
      powerful at the small expense of some test coverage.

      Part 3 of Ward's blog series on the portal includes more
      explanation, screen shots, and a link to the live test site.
      Find the blog series here:
      http://dash.eclipse.org/~ward/portal-blog/

          Agenda:

              7:00 - 7:30  Business
                   We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects

                   PLUG's monthly hands on clinics, PLUG for Education,
                   etc.

                   Also, there are changes coming for LinuxFund.
                   I will spend a few minutes discussing these.

Subject: [PLUG] Eye candy Web pages
Message-ID: <463A3611.1090002@alcpress.com>

I'm updating some web sites so they don't look like
they were designed by an oaf with no eye for style (me).
For the BizNix site, for example, I'd like something that
scrolls words and phrases in some sexy way. If you look
at the main page (http://biznix.org/) now, I have a
Javascript text scroller that minimally does the job.
It doesn't look great.

I see that the Javascript scroller places quite a demand
on the CPU at the browser side (of course). I'm wondering
whether Flash would be a better choice. I have no
experience creating Flash content. What does it take to
create Flash content on Linux or the iMac?

Or should I consider some other way of producing this
content?

Assuming the tar file uses relative paths, the following should do 
what you want.

cd /
tar -xvf path_to_tar_file/some.tar

Just to be safe, I typically untar into a scratch directory under tmp, 
then move the files/directories into the proper place.

Checking the man page, it looks like gnu tar normally strips any 
leading slash from filenames in the tar file, so that should not be an 
issue.  I don't believe this is necessarily the case with all tar 
implementations.

There are about a million different ways to skin this cat. I'd bet if you
spent some time browsing one of the many javascript repository sites out
there, you'd find a script that does what you want elegantly.
Dynamicdrive.com has a number of example scripts that might get you started.
Depending on what exactly you're looking for, it might just need some CSS
love to look good.

As the amount of "flash" you want to have increases, so does the
appropriateness of Flash. Personally, I consider Flash a last resort. As far
as authoring, there is not a whole lot on Linux, though there is some.
Unfortunately, the specific names of the projects escape me at the moment. I
seem to recall them being less than fully baked, however. On the iMac, you
have lots of options, Adobe's entire line of tools should be available.

Or should I consider some other way of producing this

I think you should stick with JS until you are sure what you want can't be
accomplished with it. It's generally more portable and accessible than
Flash. I find it useful to do non-functional mockups of sites to get the
design done before I try to implement it for real. Use whatever tool you're
most comfortable with, be it photoshop, inkscape, openoffice, or NVU. Get
the design where you want it, then try to tackle the implementation
obstacles. If you find something you can't get past, revisit the design
mockup and change it accordingly.

The javascript doesn't place much demand on my system, it's hard to tell 
how much as it gets lost in the noise of everything else that runs.  I'm 
using ff2 on what's probably a middle of the road box.

If you want to go the flash route, as far as I know there's no fancy 
flash authoring tools for linux, the Mac is well supported by Adobe but 
the tools aren't free (~$700 list for flash cs3).  You can use something 
like Ming (http://ming.sourceforge.net/) or you can probably find a 
canned free/free as in beer/shareware flash movie that'll do what you 
need too.

Just because I can't resist...

Does the site really have a problem that's solved by animation?
Movement is generally a bad thing, unless you really want your users
to be focused on the moving stuff.  (is a scrolling marquee really
that much different from a blink tag?)

Apologies for not providing references, I'm a bit short on time at the moment.

Two 1-GB Corsair RAM
Raidmax case, replaced PS with Antec 500 w

Any time I have extensive disk activity I get a sudden power off, like
pulling the power plug out of the back. I have run the Western Digital
Lifesaver Diagnostic Utility on the Ultimate Boot CD and it ran all the
way through (70+ minutes) with the hard drive light on constantly the
whole time. No errors. But formatting a partition will power off the
computer after a few minutes. So will adding a device with mdadm.

I have replaced the the power supply and I have swapped the motherboard
for a new one, but the problem persists.

In the BIOS there is an option to shutdown on certain errors. I set it
to "no errors." I think that applies to booting only, but I'm grasping
at straws here. 

Does anyone know if there is a list somewhere of hardware faults that
can cause a sudden power off? If this was your box, what would you
suspect next?

The -t option (test) to tar can be very useful - it will show you how 
the archive will be expanded without actually expanding it.

Over current on any output line of the power supply.  Possibly the CPU now doing
too much and sucking the power supply off line?

To prove it would be the CPU and not the HDs find something that is
CPU intensive
and run it.  If you can get close  to 100% on both CPUs then I would think that
you have a HD error causing the problem.  HD formatting doesn't work a
HD very hard.

I'm a technical geek happy to look at static and understated
content. I prefer function over form. But lately I've been
paying more attention to what other people, such as my
customers, think. Animation and sexy graphics make a big
difference to them. A company with inferior products can
easily gain the edge with a good looking Web site.

Being that I'm a Computer Based Training developer part time, I'm a
bit biased towards Flash because you can use it to do just about
anything you can imagine.

In terms of some of the creativity you can offer, sites such as
www.cavemanscrib.com and www.27bobs.com comes to mine.  But there are
a bunch of examples that would just blow your mind.

Unfortunately, the Flash IDE is built for Windoze and MAC.  However,
you might want to check out www.osflash.org (Open Source Flash).  It
is a site deditacted to providing free examples and 3rd party open
source (free) products.  You can get around the IDE using things such
as HAXE and SwfMill.

Certain modern versions of less can be used on a tarball and will show
the contents in a similar fashion to ls -al.

I can't speak for your customers, but I have never seen an 
animation/flash component that didn't hit me somewhere on the scale 
between annoyed and almost literally sick.  I occasionally wonder how 
many seizures are caused by blinking web sites.

Maybe blinking red on green is the answer, but I would imagine a 
tasteful design with professional photographs (you know, the whole 
"smart-looking, happy customer" thing) and nice logos would be most 
effective.  The hypothesis being that 98% of the animations on the web 
are basically cheap hacks at the "dynamicity" which a talented 
artist/designer can deliver in a still.

Of course, movement doesn't have to be tacky and distracting.  It's all 
about subtlety.

Looks like you already got plenty of help.

So, just out of curiosity, why would you want to extract a tarball in  
the root directory?

Just asking.

First, to Alan, yes I have run memtest86+, although only for an hour.
However, there are two memory slots and each has a 1 GB Corsair stick
in it. I removed the stick that was in slot 1 and moved the stick from
slot 2 into it. There was no change in the problem. Assuming that slot
1 is the first one to be used, and none of the things I have been doing
have used very much RAM, I am guessing that this eliminates RAM as an
issue.

For my most recent attempt I reset the BIOS using the jumper on the
motherboard, then entered the BIOS and set it to "Optimized defaults."
This is what Abit recommends for new installations or any time there
are problems. When I rebooted I was surprised to see Feisty start to
load even though there was a GRML Rescue CD in the drive. Then I
realized that "Optimized defaults" must have set the initial boot drive
to the hard disk. Lame, but oh well. 

The interesting thing is that Feisty actually booted all the way up. I
haven't seen Feisty running on this box for about four days now. I just
stared at it for a while and then left it running while I worked at the
laptop. I never touched the mouse or keyboard. After about 15 minutes
the screen went black and computer shut down. All by itself. 

So then I restarted it, went into the BIOS, and changed the boot order
so it would boot from the CD. I had the GRML Rescue CD in the drive, so
when I exited the BIOS that is what came up. But it won't even finish
booting without getting shut down. I tried it several times, but I
can't get the GRML Rescue CD to finish booting.  I think things are
getting worse.

I guess next I need to check the CPU. The Ultimate Boot CD has CPU
tests, but only for Intel CPUs. This is AM-2 64-bit. I'll google and
see if I can turn something up.

Might be CPU overheating. causing the machine to shutdown in order to
prevent it from blowing up (not literally of course)

I second Drew's suggestion.  Check the CPU, heatsink, and fan. 
Overheating is the only explanation that seems to fit the data, 
although now that I think about it, why didn't memtest86 crash?

If you are at the meeting, perhaps we can discuss some other tests to 
try.  One idea that comes to mind is running without any hard disks. 
I haven't been following along too closely, but will your machine run 
indefinitely off of a CD-ROM?  If so, I wonder if it could 
successfully compile a kernel using source located on a ramdisk.

Memtest86 does not push the cpu.

You could always run "make test" from OpenSSL.

The 'yes' command can push your CPU pretty hard, like this:

$ yes I am john and this is my test

It will run until you stop it with ctrl + C.

I don't use tar much to compress files; rather, I prfer gzip. Some MS  
Windows PCs don't recognize the .tar extension. I hope this helps.

But it's hard to believe that formatting(mke2fs, I assume) a disk 
works the cpu any harder than memtest86.  There's always cpuburn if he 
really wants to stress the cpu.

tar doesn't compress files at all. never has.
the -z and -Z options filter the tar contents through compress or gzip

And gnu tar with the -j option will use bzip2.  This is used on the 
kernels at kernel.org(.tar.bz2) and other places.

It can't be the heat. I can see the heat from the PC Health page in the
BIOS and it is very low. More to the point, the settings for "Warning
Temperature" and "Shutdown Temperature" are grayed out because they
were disabled by default and I haven't changed them. This thing could
set fire to the sun and it wouldn't shut down.

How long should I let it run?

Having said that, everyone hold your breath. I booted to Feisty, which
last time went to power off after about 15 minutes of just sitting
doing nothing. It has been sitting there running now for 30 minutes.
Cross your fingers! Throw salt over your shoulder! Sacrifice a virgin!

Perhaps you've already removed this possibility by setting your BIOS to no 
errors, but I had a computer a while back that would shut down.  There was a 
temperature setting in the BIOS that would shut down the machine when the 
CPU reached a certain temp...

Not to pick on Christine, but I must make something clear. It cannot be
heat. It happens when the machine is stone cold. Plus the BIOS settings
for temperature warning and shutdown are dsabled. 

It happened *once* when formatting a large partition. However it
happens repeatedly and reliably when creating a large RAID 1 partition.
I got it to the point where Feisty will load and run normally. No
sudden shutdowns -- over an hour of using it for all kinds of things.
In order to accomplish this I deleted the /dev/md3 RAID 1 array that I
had attempted to create previously. 

Once I was sure Feisty was finally stable I used Gparted to create two
new unformatted partitions, a matching one on each of the two hard
drives, sda and sdb. Each partition is 238 MB, sda4 and sdb4. Then,
still using Gparted, I set the flags on each partition to RAID. Then I
shut down Gparted because that is as far as Gparted can go in creating
a RAID. For the rest you need mdadm. So here is the code for what I did
next with mdadm:

jjj at Devil6:~$ sudo mdadm --create /dev/md3 --level=1
	--raid-devices=2 /dev/sd[ab]4 jjj at Devil6:~$ password
jjj at Devil6:~$ <messages about finding sda4 and sdb4>
jjj at Devil6:~$ Create array? (Y/N) y
jjj at Devil6:~$ Created array
jjj at Devil6:~$ 

Now, there is a little documentation problem with the above code. Mdadm
doesn't say so, but after it says "Created array" it is not finished.
It will now proceed to do mkfs on /dev/md3, and that will take about
1.75 hours. The hard drive light will stay on constantly until it is
finished. 

Four or five minutes later I get a shutdown.

If I reboot any version of any distro, the mnute it finishes booting,
the mkfs command automatically starts up again. Of course, because of
the shutdown the previous efforts are wiped out and it must start
formatting /dev/md3 over again from the start. The hard disk light is
on constantly.

Four or five minutes later I get a shutdown.

If i reboot i can get Feisty to run perfectly normally by opening a
terminal and typing "sudo mdadm -S /dev/md3." That stops it from
continuing to format and sync /dev/md3. The hard disk light goes out.
Feisty then continues to run perfectly normally for as long as I want
to keep it running.

So something is now becoming clear to me. I think I don't have a real
problem with any of the hardware. Where I have a problem is using Linux
software RAID on these drives. A wild guess is that it has to do with
the fact that it is essentially formatting both disks at the same time
and making sure the blocks are synced. The drives are not liking this. 

Consider also that at one time before I discovered that you cannot set
a RAID flag on a partition once it has been formatted, I created the
238 GB partition and had Gparted format it (a single drive at a time).
The formatting proceeded and ended normally.

I would suggest that it's a bug in mdadm, but "incompatibility" might
be more accurate. Perhaps there's something about these drives that
mdadm cannot handle. Yet, I did create a 2 GB RAID 1 swap, a 20 and a
40 GB regular RAID 1 partition, and they proceeded normally. But when I
created those I used the GUI in Etch and Feisty Alternate,
respectively. I'm assuming the GUI is a front end for mdadm, so perhaps
the reason those proceeded was because they were smaller. I don't know.
I just know that I have finally isolated exactly when it is happening.
I think for my next exercise I need to google on bugs for mdadm and
perhaps communicate with its developers.

I hope the meeting went well tonight. I have an early morning class and
needed to spend some time on a paper so I could not go. Thanks to all
who offered suggestions. And if anyone has any further thoughts about
mdadm, please let me know.

And gnu tar with the -j option will use bzip2.  This is used on the
kernels at kernel.org(.tar.bz2) and other places.

Generally, it's preferred to reply in-line, so we can tell what you're
replying to.  If you become active in the group you may consider
switching from digest mode to getting each message separately.  Any
email client worth it's salt (and many, many clients that *aren't*)
will be able to filter email from the list in a way that makes the
bulk of email manageable.  It helps the rest of us with threading, at
the very least. (since digest messages usually break email threading)

> What is the difference between tar and

gzip compresses single files -- as far as I know, gzip will not create
a compressed archive of a number of files on it's own.  "zip" is
another tool entirely (although it accomplishes a *similar* function.
More on zip later.)

tar does the other half of what most people need -- it combines files
into one, but does not compress them.  (There is a *lot* more to tar
than that, but I'm not the person to go into it.)

tar and gzip follow the unix philosophy pretty closely:  Do one task,
and do that task very well.  In order to compress a whole host of
files, you need to tar them, and then gzip the result.  Now days, tar
is capable of calling gzip (or bzip2) directly, so you don't need
multiple commands, but in the past, you needed to pipe tar to gzip, or
run tar, and then manually gzip the result.  This is at least part of
the reason you see so many files ending in .tar.gz -- they are tar's
(files created by tar) that have been gziped (hence the .gz).
Slackware packages use the more terse .tgz, which may have other
connotations, like being compatible with the slackware "install"
utilities, but under the hood these files are also tar.gz's.

You could think of tar as a bag to hold things, and gzip as
compression straps that make it smaller.  Without the bag, the
contents would just go squirting all over the place.

zip does the task of both tar and gzip, but it's not as unix-y.  IIRC,
it was originally a dos tool, but I'm not 100% sure of that.

At this point, most windows machines will open a .tar.gz (recent
versions of winzip are perfectly happy opening them).

Rod,

   Reminds me of Yellow Pine, ID. They first got land-line phone service
about 6-8 years ago. Before that it was radiotelephones.

   I hooked up my linux notebook to my satellite phone (on the Iridium
network) several years ago, but the data transmission rate was very slow,
the price high, and the need not pressing. It wasn't difficult.

Roderick,

I had a friend in North Portland running this for his
business.  He had alot of problems with it, especially
during storms, etc.  Line of sight is important
too(overhanging branches, etc).  

As far as how it was set up, it seems to me that it
was a normal ethernet connection to the machine.  My
friend ran his to a router, and served his entire
office with it.  Only problem he had was that it
needed a machine to "sync" the service to the
satelite.  some sort of data communcation between the
cpe and the home computer...  not sure if thats needed
or not, but might be something to look out for.  Of
course, that was probably 5 years ago.

I can't offer any personal experience, but I'm interested in how it
works out for your friend.

I did a Google search on 'RV "high speed Internet"' awhile back.
Eventually I found this page:

http://www.copperhead.cc/fap.htm

It explains the hughes.net Fair Access Policy. It's hughes.net's way of
preventing anyone from doing lots of downloads a lot of the time. Once
you get to your quota your effective download speed drops to that of a
56k baud modem and stays there for the "recovery period", which may be
8-12 hours (see the above web site for details). It would become a
problem if one is trying to download an install DVD, for example.

I think Hughes uses a satellite delay compensation
technique that tries to convert the highly
interactive HTTP/TCP into a more efficient
protocol for long-delay satellite channels. I don't
know if it's handled in their "modem" or if there's
a client-side (browser-side) component.

If you're still interested in messing with this you might try to assemble
md3 degraded (start the mirror with half missing).

? maybe something like ?:
# mdadm --assemble /dev/md3 --raid-devices=2 --add /dev/sda4 --run

[Monkey with contents / format of md3 as needed...]
If it's stable (relatively) then try adding sdb4 and letting the raid sync.

Subject: [PLUG] Mounting an odd filesystem type
Message-ID: <463CC595.8080905@comcast.net>

I tried adding another drive to my vintage 1995 200MHz NEC machine
(really Packard-Bell) to replace the no-longer-working 40 GB drive. When
I installed it, the BIOS recognized it and reported the correct Seagate
model number, but fdisk couldn't access it. Since I have a newer, 330
MHz machine I can "upgrade" to, I decided to copy what was left on the
still-working 8.4 GB drive over to my main machine. The NEC has RH 7.0
loaded on it, but I never did get nfs working. I do have Samba working,
so I added a few lines to make / visible to my network. For whatever
reason, that didn't work. The other two shares in smb.conf do work, but
don't capture all I want to get. So, on to step 2.

I pulled the drive from the NEC and installed it in my USB IDE
enclosure. fdisk -l shows:

Disk /dev/sda: 8622 MB, 8622931456 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 1048 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

But, mount won't mount it. I'm pretty sure it has an ext2 file system on
it, but that's not what fdisk shows:

Command (m for help): p

Disk /dev/sda: 8622 MB, 8622931456 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 1048 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1   *           1        1047     8410023   54  OnTrackDM6

I remember having to use the OnTrack software to get the machine to be
able to use the large (for 1995) drive. I can still boot from it, and I
suspect I'll be able to find some place in the home network that will
see it. But, I'd rather learn how to deal with this with mount, or some
other tool.

Any ideas?

For whatever other reason, it works now: I can see the entire drive.

Subject: [PLUG] Samba Problem
Message-ID: <463D2D47.4020604@comcast.net>

I have a problem between Samba on my Slackware 11 system and my XP
laptop. Using Konqueror I can browse to any number of directories and
individual files on my XP machine. When I try to copy them, I get the
error message:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Access denied to /mnt/hd/1712 Overture and Other Musical Assaults.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

("1712 Overture and Other Musical Assaults" is the name of the directory
on the XP machine that I'm trying to copy.)

Using Winders Explorer, I can see Slack-2 in my network. When I click on
the icon for a directory, home, on Slack-2, I get the error message:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
\\Slack-2\home is not accessible. You might not have permission to use
this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find
out if you have access permissions.

The network path was not found.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the administrator of this server doesn't have a clue
about what's wrong here. I have no trouble connecting to my XP laptop
and copying files from there on my SuSE 10.1 machine.

Any hints on where to start looking for a solution?

TIA.

Dick,
The answers are in /etc/samba.conf :-) I haven't used Samba in a few years
but I used to have to change a few things from a default slackware install
to make it happy and work, my changes made it more insecure since I had no
password protection but I wasn't concerned as the network was private.

If you want username and password protection, you simply need to add
users to the smbpasswd file with:

     smbpasswd -a <username>

and add "encrypt_passwords = yes" to the global section of smb.conf.

Sometimes it's handy to fire up swat, but make a backup of your
smb.conf file first.  It's a handy way to browse all the possible
samba config settings.  Once you get a good smb.conf, though, guard it
like you would your kernel .config file.

I thought I had sent this out before, but since Dave Mandel thought it was a

Subject: Save the date! BarCamp Portland Tech Unconference, May 11-12

I am pleased to announce that BarCamp is coming to Portland on May 11-12! We will also be
kicking off the regular DemoCamp event series during BarCamp to highlight tech startup activity
in the Portland area.

Tech + Geek + Culture. The event for the Portland tech community, produced BY the Portland tech
community.

What is BarCamp? It is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in
an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from
participants.

BarCamp is a FREE event and the content is determined by the attendees. The event will be hosted
at CubeSpace, which has a number of conference rooms for breakout sessions, a large main meeting
area, wireless access, easy access to public transportation, bike storage, and ample parking.
Thanks to Eva and David at CubeSpace for signing up as space sponsors for the event (and to Ray
at AboutUs for sponsoring the additional space costs).

We need your help to make BarCamp Portland a fantastic event for the tech community in Portland.
Here's what you can do...

1) Forward this email on to people in the Portland area that may have an interest in attending.
As we have done little marketing of the event (so far), assume that your local tech social
network doesn't know about it yet.

2) If you have not already added yourself to the BarCamp Portland wiki page as an attendee,
please do so. This will help us get a more accurate attendance count and plan accordingly (you
want food, right?):

http://barcamp.org/BarCampPortland

3) Add a session idea for the event. This could be a talk, a demo, a roundtable discussions -
whatever! Please add it to the Proposed Sessions section on the wiki page:

http://barcamp.org/BarCampPortland

4) Attend the BarCamp Portland Meetup this Thursday (03/22) evening 5:30-8pm at Jive Software
downtown. Free beer on tap (thanks, Jive!), the opportunity to network with the tech community
in Portland, and help plan for BarCamp Portland. More details:

http://barcamp.org/BarCampPortlandMeetups

5) Help identify sponsors. CubeSpace and AboutUs are already onboard as sponsors for the space
and related costs (and Jive Software has been our ongoing meetup and planning sponsor). We are
looking for sponsors to cover food, drinks, and t-shirts.

I hope to see you this Thursday evening at Jive Software for our monthly tech meetup and BarCamp
Portland planning meeting!

I did both of those back when I installed Samba. I checked to be sure
that "encrypt_passwords = yes" is in my smb.conf, and it is. I redid the
smbpasswd command. The user name and password are the same on both
machines. Still no joy.

>From the swat man page I found what is supposed to be needed to run swat
in the form of entries in /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/services. The entry
in inetd.conf was already there, but commented out, and the entry in
services is there, too (not commented out). I followed the instructions
at the top of inetd.conf for sending kill -HUP <pid for inetd> but
couldn't connect to //localhost:901/. I got a message that the connect
is broken (something like that -- I've turned that machine off for the
night).

I had a really simple samba.conf on my old NEC machine. Maybe I should
try that one.

I think this is true with all Sat ISP's.  They limit in overall 
transfer.  Not pretty after you hit that limit.  But even while 
operating normally, my friends church (in clackamas) has outage problems 
weekly, and the speed is very inconsistent.  Support literally tells him 
it will be a week before someone can come out and help.  His modem, and 
most other Sat modems are standard DOCSIS modems, the same as any cable 
modem.  So platform shouldn't matter.  I have an OpenBSD firewall 
getting the first IP at his location.

This assumes you truly understand where function and form meet, and can 
stay away from where they do battle.  What your customers think is often 
difficult to articulate in your own mind.  As my brother who does 
graphics design knows well.  Often times what he thinks stinks, his 
customers love and vice-versa.

Tickers and scrollers are not sexy, period.  Animations 99% of the time 
are a really bad idea.  But this is somewhat dependent on the 
implementation and the target audience.  Most people just want to get 
where they need to go quickly.  Try to make your site navigation 
intuitive and make as much as you can available in two clicks or less.

I was just perusing the leatherman.com site this morning, and it does 
really well with the two click rule and having the animations integrated 
in an appropriate manner.

If you really want a good looking website, hire someone to do it for you 
who does this for a living.  You can have Joomla! templates custom made 
for around $1200 to $1500, or pick one already made that's close to what 
you like for less than $100.  They also have several free templates. 
Just expect those to be used on several other sites around then web too.

I have seen several articles linked on digg.com that point to good web 
design etiquette.  Many of them all say the same thing.  I would read up 
on it if you want to do this yourself.

Of course, the above is opinion and I don't claim to be an authority on 
web design.  You'll find the same suggestions in many places online though.

Message-ID: <463E3D59.3080509@cesmail.net>

I finally got around to taking the dual-core 64-bit plunge, specifically 
with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+. So far:

1. Ubuntu Feisty Fawn freezes in the install -- buh bye Ubuntu!

2. Debian Etch installs flawlessly but has frozen twice. I'm not sure 
what that is -- looks like kernel and not hardware but I can't be sure.

3. CentOS 5 installs flawlessly even with Xen. I haven't had it up long 
enough to know whether it will freeze or not, and it needs some X 
tweaking, but other than that I think it's OK.

4. Fedora? Why bother?

I took a couple of shots at Gentoo and had all kinds of kernel issues 
with their 2006.1 media, and 2007.0 isn't released yet. So ... next step 
is to pick the more stable of CentOS or Etch and bootstrap Gentoo in 
that way. So I'll have a clean kernel, etc., on the Gentoo side. But 
meanwhile it looks like CentOS is the horse to beat.

What's your kernel? I'm just now taking the Athlon 64 X2 plunge, at a 
lower scale than you have, and I'm seeing similar things. I don't get 
power offs but I do get freezes. Feisty Fawn was the worst -- it 
couldn't even pull off an install. I've gotten Etch and CentOS 5 
installs to complete reliably, and they both use some flavor of 2.4.18 
stabilized kernel. I had a couple of freezes in Etch during disk 
activity, but I haven't hit CentOS 5 hard enough yet to know if it does 
the same thing.

I got one "OOPS" traceback out of Etch. If I can get something 
reproducible I'll post it to the Debian mailing lists. And once I get 
Gentoo installed I'll do most of my debugging there, because that's what 
I really want to run on this box. :) But I'd look at kernels before 
hardware at this point.

This new box is ultimately to be used as a storage area for backups and
as an alternative way to get on the net when I screw up my laptop,
which will be my main computer indefinitely. Therefore, I have to
luxury of playing hard with it, like installing all kinds of distros,
wiping out, starting over, etc. 

I tried a lot of distros, all 64-bit:

Fedora 7 test2, updated to test3+ before giving up. It ran flawlessly,
but RPM and I will never be friends. Package management is a pain for
someone brought up on Ubuntu like me. I missed me my Synaptic! Fedora
was one of only two that automatically detected the nVidia GeForce
6100, and even the ViewSonic Graphics Series G90f monitor. However, it
failed hopelessly with the Realtek gigabit on the motherboard. Most
others did as well, but they ignored it. Fedora would go into a kernel
panic on booting unless I disabled the Realtek in the BOS.

Gentoo 2006.1 was the only other one that found and autoconfigured the
video and monitor. However, it ignored the gigabit. I couldn't get it
to do a RAID 1 partition. It recognized a RAID 1 partition created by
another distro and installed itself on it, but its installed could not
create a new RAID partition. 

Mandriva-free 2007 did sort of OK, but couldn't handle the video or the
gigabit. I wasn't impressed, and considering that it is
semi-commercial, to hell iwth it.

OpenSuse 10.2, ditto Mandriva-free 2007

Simply Mepis 6.5 rc2, couldn't recognize the video or the gigabit, and
was way too stripped down for my taste. 

CentOS 5, ditto what I said about Simply Mepis.

Debian Etch worked very well. It and Ubuntu were the only ones that
could handle the Realtek 8169SC gigabit. However, neither could
recognize or configure the video. I abandoned Etch in favor of Feisty
because Feisty has more candy and better support (the forums rock).

Ubuntu Feisty, using the Alternate install CD worked great out of the
box. It autoconfigured the gigabit, but not the video. However, it is
easy to install the nVidia driver with Ubuntu, ditto for audio and
video codecs and stuff. With a couple clicks I installed 32-bit
RealPlayer, 32-bit Adobe Reader 7.0.8, 32-bit Opera 9.0 and Flash 9.0
(which I use only with Opera). This box is really fast, and the gigabit
is part of it. Web sites seem to load twice as fast as they do on the
laptop, which is also 64-bit but only 10/100. Feisty uses
2.6.20-15-generic #2 SMP kernel on this box.

The only problem remaining with Feisty is the poweroff problem that I
have discussed here at length. I have finally tracked down what is
happening, I just don't know yet exactly what the cause is. What
happens is I get a sudden power off as though I pulled the power cable
out of the back of the machine. The first time this happened was when I
was formatting a 238 GB partition that had been part of /dev/md3, a
RAID 1 array. The array got goobered up and I was trying to fix it.
E2fsck found a lot of errors on the lost partition, but before running
e2fsck on it I tried just mkfs. After a few minutes of formatting I got
the power off. But that is the only time I ever got a power off from
formatting. I abandoned the formatting, deleted and then recreated the
partition, and then added the partition with "mdadm
-a /dev/md3 /dev/sdb4." At that point it started "recovering," and a
few minutes later I got another power off.

Later I deleted both 238 GB partitions and the array, then recreated
the partitions and the array. I deleted/recreated the partitions in
Gparted and in the process set them first to unformatted, then set the
RAID flag. Then I used mdadm --create to set them up as a RAID 1 array.
All this went just fine. The problem is that after mdadm says it has
created the array it then has to sync the partitions. For a 238 GB
array it estimated this would take 99 minutes. I have never gotten
close. I get a power off no later than six minutes into it, sometimes
within seconds of starting.

The problem is that once you create the array mdadm has the array
marked as "needing to be synced" and it will commence the syncing all
by itself as soon as you boot an operating system, even a rescue CD. So
Feisty boots and runs fine now, but if I forget to do mdadm -S /dev/md3
to stop the array right after booting I will get a power off within a
few minutes.

What is causing this? Well, the hard drives are two identical Western
Digital 320 GB SATA II drives. I note that I did create three other
RAID 1 arrays just fine, a 2 GB swap, a 40 GB Feisty, and a 20 GB
(fromerly) Etch. The difference is that all three were created by an
install utility, not directly by mdadm (but does the install utility
call mdadm?) and all three are much smaller. Is either fact
significant? I don't know and I haven't had time to do much sleuthing.
I do know the drives are on the SATA connectors on the motherboard and
the chipset is nVidia 405 with a Phoenix-Award BIOS. The BIOS is the
latest available. Is it in the controller? Is it in mdadm? Is it in
sata-nv? All I know is that it cannot be heat and the power supply and
the motherboard have both been replaced with no change in the problem.
I've been too busy to tackle it any further, but fixing it is near the
top of my list.

I don't have any idea what made Feisty lock up on installation. It
certainly can't be the CPU. And if everything else installed OK, then
it doesn't sound like a hardware fault. Must be a missing driver for
something that every other distro is able to load or at least ignore.

I'd also suggest giving Fedora 7 a shot. I was very impressed with it,
and that was with test2. Besides, it's fun to install new distros. :)

  I've been running Fedora 5 on several machines for a couple of
years.  No worries, it works fine for me.  It's also working fine on a
couple machines I've built for some non-geek friends.

  A recent FC5 update for ALSA recently broke the sound in my laptop.
I'm just going to install FC6 to fix the sound.  It will also force me
to clean up my machine for F7 in a month or two.  I' going to upgrade
my friends machines to F7 as soon as it's stable.

Arch Linux has pretty good 64-bit support.  As long as you're planning
to take the Gentoo route, might as well try out Arch (lots of folks
*from* Gentoo -- and Slack -- on the Arch forums).

What he said.  

Also, you should read the second (or later) edition of the book
"Don't Make Me Think" by Steve Krug.  I have given these as presents to
my web designer friends, who then bought copies for the rest of their
companies.  It won't make a web designer out of you, but will teach you
some things to look for when you choose the web designer you spend $1500
on.

The message of the book is "put stuff where your user expects it" so
they don't have to work too hard.  The users and browsers are becoming
more educated, and most people's connections are getting faster, so
the dominant paradigm shifts over time.  Hence the emphasis on the
latest edition.

For an E-commerce site, Krug's favorite is Amazon.  Think about
how big the Bezos empire is becoming, and you have an empirical
verification of Krug's opinion.  Krug says why Amazon and other
sites work, and that is the part you can apply to your own goals.

"... Think" is a spendy little paperback, but it is a pleasant read.

Everything I read on google in the last 10 minutes indicates that
there are many gentoo users running this CPU.  There's more to kernel
happiness than the CPU choice.  I would lay suspicion on the video
card first (assuming none of the hardware is clinically ill).  Do you
have an ATI Radeon video card?  I can get one of those to freeze a
machine.

Try the ubuntu installer in text mode, if that choice is offered.  If
it doesn't freeze in text mode, that points to the video card.  I'd
bet that's why you could get debian installed (is the debian installer
still text-only?).

I always have to install redhat ES 4 in text mode on IBM 346's, which
come with an ATI Radeon card.  And I have to add "nolapic" to the
kernel command line until I can get into the running redhat load and
change the video driver to vesa in xorg.conf.  Then I remove
"nolapic".  Even when using the vesa driver on the 346, I get
occasional freeze-ups (not cool in a server).  The new IBM server
which replaces the 346 (I forgot its model number) has a newer ATI
card (not a Radeon), and I've seen no freeze-ups yet.  The new server
is 64-bit, by the way, but it's Intel.  I have yet to install gentoo
on one of these, and I probably won't get to, because the corporate
entity where I work won't consider gentoo for servers.

The kernel that is running when you boot from a gentoo install CD has
nothing to do with the kernel that you build for your installation.
And the age of the gentoo CD has nothing to do with the newness of the
packages you install.  If a gentoo CD doesn't run, use a CD that does.
There's no requirement that you need a gentoo CD to install gentoo.  I
always use knoppix.  Or install centos and use it for your host
environment, and install gentoo on a second hard drive, and make it
the first hard drive when done.

What does your lspci look like?

No ... what's different about Fedora is corporate support. The forums 
are public, the processes are open, the innovation is rapid, etc. for 
Debian, Gentoo, and CentOS as well. The difference is corporate support 
from Red Hat to the limit the law will allow.

Nope -- 100 percent pure nVidia chipset/motherboard. I haven't found a 
drop of ATI blood anywhere.

Neither the Etch installer nor the CentOS installer has frozen in GUI 
mode. Only Feisty did that. :)

That's probably worth trying on the CentOS side. I'm just about to give 
up on CentOS because I can't get a decent-looking screen -- vesa mode 
may just be what I'm looking for. :) Do I *have* to remove "nolapic"??

I'll reply with the CORRECT email address this time:

Is this an HP because I've had different troubles with two HP systems 
running Ubuntu (Kubuntu on one)? I also had trouble with OpenSuSE 10.3 
(various versions of Alpha) and 10.2.

I found that by running with /noapic nolapic pci=routeirq/ allowed 
installation on the one system (an HP Laptop - DV6253) giving me the 
most problems.

You might see if some combination of those parameters allow it to load. 
Based upon looking up my model, and related models, HP changed something 
in their chipset that was giving various Linux distros issues.

Debian is rapidly innovating?

CentOS is repackaging what Red Hat provides. A great community
service, but hardly innovation.

I understand how to log on to machine B from machine A via ssh to give

I just call it ssh.  The long-winded call it "X11 forwarding over ssh".

Dick,

   In /etc/ssh/sshd_config uncomment 'X11Forwarding yes'.

   In /etc/ssh/ssh_config uncomment 'ForwardX11 yes'.

   Then, on machine A type 'ssh -X user at machine.B.com' and -- once logged in
-- run your application.

   See:

Personally, I call it "magic" ...

Given that both systems have the X software installed, if you ssh from
A to B with the flags "-X -A", if sshd_config on B allows X11
forwarding, you can run X programs on B like "gvim file" and have the
window pop up on A.

I can do it from here to a system I develop on in Houston, but the
resulting gvim window is less responsive than a "normal" terminal
window. Your mileage may vary.

Thanks. X11 forwarding is the piece I was missing.

Also, thanks to Rich and Russ for examples and further details.

The term you're looking for is 'Remote X-windows' usually shortened to 'Remote 
X'.  The easiest way to do this is ssh -X <user>@<host>. That sets up a X 
tunnel and you (usually) don't have to worry about doing DISPLAY=IP:0.0; 
export DISPLAY.

Subject: [PLUG] No Sound
Message-ID: <463F72DB.2050406@comcast.net>

I've just replaced an old modem/sound card in my Slackware 11 machine.
It looks like it's there (KMix shows a lot of controls for the SB Live
5.1 card I installed), and when I run mpg123 it acts like it's running,
but I don't hear anything.

I've checked to be sure output isn't muted in KMix, and that level
controls are somewhere other than all the way down. I've also checked to
make sure the speakers are turned on, and plugged in to the correct
output jack on the back of the card.

Any other ideas?

TIA.

An old trick I always used to test audio was to cat a .wav file to
/dev/dsp.  (It has to be an uncompressed audio file--an mp3/ogg or
flac won't necessarily make noise.)  If it works, then the problem is
in user-space.

have you run alsamixer to make sure its not muted there and that all apps
are using the alsa output and not OSS?

Dick,

   If you wander over to www.alsasound.org, head to the wiki and the
troubleshooting page. It has a sequence of steps to be followed. They work.

   For instance, do you have your card in /proc/asound/cards? Can you run
alsamixer?

   I almost had that page memorized while getting sound to work on the
workstation/server and the two portables. :-)

ALSA has a built-in OSS emulator; on any modern Linux it's unlikely that OSS 
is even included.

strangely enough its still included in slackware .. if you right click say
in XMMS and go to the config options you can choose the output thats used.
Other apps I believe are similar ..

Isn't it fun how in the 21st century nobody knows how to edit emails, or 
follow posting order? sigh... at any rate, is that the 'real' OSS on 
Slackware, or ALSA's OSS emulator? OSS still shows up in a lot of places, but 
it's really ALSA. For example, Asterisk wants OSS for sound on the server 
console, so it's configured for /dev/oss, but it's ALSA's OSS emulation.

Posted in the proper order, edited correctly I think, and admitting my
ignorance that it is Alsa's OSS after having checked.

The problem was on my SuSE machine. I re-entered the password for my
user account with smbpasswd. Now it works. I can reach all my Samba
connected machines.

All I can guess is that either I never ran smbpasswd on this machine, or
that when I did, I mis-typed the password twice!

It took awhile to find a .wav file and get it onto the machine (see
resolved post regarding Samba in a few minutes). Once I put a couple of
wave files on the machine I tried

cat chimes.wav > /dev/dsp

I was able to recognize it, but it sounded awful. Playing it with xmms
sounded like it should.

Thanks for the advice. I'll file this for future reference.

I solved the problem by mounting the 13 GB drive in my USB-IDE enclosure
on my SuSE machine and copying the files from my XP laptop. Then I moved
the 13 GB drive to the "new" 330 MHz machine that will replace the old
200 MHz machine. That took about 3.5 hours, but I wasn't doing anything
else with the machines at the time, so I didn't mind.

Did you try sysinstall?

When it asks "Running multiuser, assume that thenetwork is already  
configured?"
Choose "No" and it will step you through the configuration.

dmesg could be used.  If you're running the default kernel, simply run 
ifconfig on the command line and all supported interfaces with their 
current settings and state will show up.

is FreeBSD one of those OSs that doesn't provide a path to important
commands like lspci? Try "locate lspci" and if it shows up, give the
command including the path.

It also appears that pciutils (containing lspci) is installed in ports.

cd /usr/ports/sysutils/pciutils
make
make install
lspci

Haven't tried this though. YMMV.

I'm supporting production FreeBSD environments now.  It's been a
fun/interesting/frustrating journey for a 10 year Debian user.

After using FreeBSD, one feels lazy and well cared for while using
Debian (which is great, don't get me wrong).

Message-ID: <463FCA8B.3040704@comcast.net>

I found this instruction at:

http://alsa.opensrc.org/Using_alsactl_to_preserve_volume_state

I realize I need to restore the settings when the sound driver is
loaded, such as at boot time. Here is what is said:

--------------------------------------------------------------
   # load/unload the volume settings on startup/shutdown
   post-install snd-driver-name /usr/sbin/alsactl restore
   pre-remove snd-driver-name /usr/sbin/alsactl store
--------------------------------------------------------------

That's great. But, what do I put in place of snd-driver-name? There are
several drivers listed with lsmod that begin with snd. The one that
seems most obvious is snd-mixer-oss, but that's just a guess.

Dick,

   On the ALSA sound wiki troubleshooting page they have an grep string to
identify the module you need to load. I don't recall the syntax.

No one has mentioned XDMCP yet.  When you use XDMCP to gain a remote X
session, it is exactly as if you were sitting at the console of the
host.  The only difference is that the monitor, keyboard and mouse you
are using happen to be connected to some other machine.  Hummingbird
uses XDMCP.  You can accomplish the same thing with cygwin for free.

This is not a replacement for the immensely useful ssh X forwarding
method already outlined.  This is for those special times when you
want an entire desktop on the host, not just a single app.

A picture is worth a thousand words.  Here's how to do it.  "Client"
is tha machine you're physically sitting at, and "host" is the remote
machine to which you'll be connecting.  The assumption is made that
you are using gdmlogin as your login manager:

- Firewall!  TCP ports 6000, 6001 (and more if you have more than two
   X displays), and UPD port 177, should be blocked from the WAN.  But
   these ports need to be accessible on the LAN.

- Set up the client for at least two X displays.  This allows you to
   have a local desktop on one display, and a remote connection on the
   other.  Do this by launching gdmsetup as root, clicking on the
   "Security" tab, clicking the "Configure X server" button, and adding
   a second "Standard" server to the list.  Close, log out, and restart
   X.  You should see 2 login screens appear, one after the other, with
   a moment of blank screen in between.

- Configure the host to allow XDMCP connections.  Start by ssh-ing

hi everyone, I?ve setup a website so that users of open source server side
software can come and look at instructional guides, how-to's, forums,
wiki's and all sorts of other information about setting up software on
Linux for both windows and Linux based networks.
http://www.opensourcehowto.org

I am currently still working on it, adding new screen shots every day,
hoping to double check a lot of my how-to's once the screen shots are
added & once that is done I will hopefully be adding streaming video of my
how-to articles using either embed code from meta caf?.
http://www.opensourcehowto.org/how-to/

I?ve also added the ability for other members of the Open Source & Linux
community to add there own howto?s if they sign up and post there own
blogs. It?s a bit of a new feature to the site & I?m really looking
forward to taking off and having lots of different people adding there own
information.
http://www.opensourcehowto.org/users-howto/user-howto/howto-create-your-own-content.html

I've made heaps changes over the past 2 months now here is a list of just
some of them.
http://www.opensourcehowto.org/announcements/

I really hope there is some useful information for people here on this
website & please, if you have any advice or help on this website, I'd love
to hear it.

I haven't been able to find a source for these Stateside, but my
employer does a lot of business with a Taiwanese supplier and as a
favor they're getting me one.

Actually, they're getting two: a bit of a language barrier has crept
in.  Before I correct 'em, would anybody on the list like the extra?
I'm assuming it'll be the advertised $100.

Message-ID: <4640B1C8.9060601@dslnorthwest.net>

If Gaim is automatically run by KDE during boot, any attempt to use it causes it
go instantly close.  (My standard test is to right click on an entry in the 
buddy list.) Top shows Gaim as running when the session starts, but it goes away 
when I perform the right click. Restarting Gaim from the K menu works fine, and 
no more problems occur during that session.


I am running Kubuntu 6.10 Edgy Eft.  Gaim was installed as a package:
1:2.0.0+beta3.1.1-1ubuntu9 is what is reported in Adept.


Anybody have any ideas on what is going on?

Subject: [PLUG] Victor needs help compiling emacs from source on unbuntu 6.06
Message-ID: <498756ed0705081231r5f42ab4fo71b7b79761c90b4b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I wasn't sure who to write to.  Even with all the Google searches I
did, I couldn't find a specific venue.  "Someone" said compiling from
source would be fun.......

Anyways, when I type emacs --version at the command line I get:

vsoich at tiberius:/$ emacs --version
GNU Emacs 21.4.1
Copyright (C) 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
GNU Emacs comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
You may redistribute copies of Emacs
under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
For more information about these matters, see the file named COPYING.
vsoich at tiberius:/$


so apparently, I successfully downloaded and compiled emacs from source.

When I type emacs at the command line, I get:

vsoich at tiberius:/$ emacs
emacs: Cannot open termcap database file
vsoich at tiberius:/$


I did a google search on the string "emacs: Cannot open termcap database file"
and got various results, including do:

apt-get install termcap-compat

I did that from the command line, and everything seem to go well, but
I'm now sure how to tell that.

Another suggestion I garnered from my google search was:

the fix is to install "libncurses5-dev" package. This will install
"termcap.h" at /usr/include. Emacs needs to be compiled again after
this.

I think I did this properly also.  My Synaptic Package Manager says
5.5-lubuntu3 is the Installed Version.  As far as "Emacs needs to be
compiled again", all I did was type in "make" in the directory

/home/vsoich/emacs-21.4

as in:

vsoich at tiberius:~/emacs-21.4$ make

but I'm now sure if that compiled emacs again.  Maybe it didn't
compile again because I've already run the make command before.  I'm
just not sure.

Anyway, I did all these things, and then I opened up a file called

/home/vsoich/emacs-21.4/etc/PROBLEMS

and a snippet from that file says:


If your system uses Terminfo rather than termcap (most modern systems
do), this could happen if you have an old version of ncurses
installed, or if the newer version is not visible to the Emacs
configure script (i.e. it cannot be found along the usual path the
linker looks for libraries).

The solution is to install a newer version of ncurses, and make sure
the linker can find it.



I think I installed the newer version of ncurses as I indicated
earlier, but I don't know
how to make sure the linker can find it.  I'm not sure what the linker
is.  It's probably what happens when I type in ./configure, or make,
or sudo make install, but I'm just not sure.

Hopefully, I've done enough due diligence as indicated in the above
descriptions as to merit help in getting emacs compiled from source
and running on my machine.  Please help!

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

Look carefully at the messages generated during the ./configure stage.
It should give you some clues about what it finds and what it doesn't.

I went to my directory

/home/vsoich/emacs-21.4

and again executed ./configure

vsoich at tiberius:~/emacs-21.4$ ./configure


and I got a lot of output that I don't understand.  I don't know what
to look for.  As per your suggestion, I did look at the messages
generated but unfortunatly I'm not getting a clue.

So, scanning for differences, the most significant ones for you are

should solve the terminal stuff.

Also, consulting the debian package's build dependencies, I find this:

 mailx, libncurses5-dev, texinfo, liblockfile-dev, libungif4-dev, libtiff4-dev | libtiff-dev, xaw3dg-dev, libpng3-dev, libjpeg62-dev, autotools-dev, dpkg-dev (>> 1.10.0), quilt, debhelper (>= 4), libxaw7-dev, sharutils

I think you can get away without mailx, quilt, dpkg-dev or debhelper,
but the others are probably useful and/or desirable.  So try this:

 $ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev texinfo liblockfile-dev libungif4-dev libtiff-dev xaw3dg-dev libpng3-dev libjpeg62-dev autotools-dev libxaw7-dev sharutils

and rerun configure, etc.

Disclaimer: I'm not a KDE user, so this idea may be totally wrong

I've seen problems similar to happen when a program starts to early in
session initialization and some of the environment variables and whatnot
that it is expecting to see haven't been setup yet. Granted this was on
Gnome, and a _long_ time ago. But, you might want to see if you can have it
start later in the session setup and see if that helps. As I said though, I
don't even know if KDE has a mechanism to do this, but I would assume that
they do...

Yea, I know about howtoforge.com there are a lot of great articles up
there but One of the things I know I love about Linux is the choice, if we
made everyone do things only one way we would be Microsoft. So maybe what
I'm offering doesn't need to be something more, maybe it's just another
choice, like the choice of Fedora, CentOS, Whitebox, RHEL, all basically
the same, with slight differences to give people a choice.

There are things that are different on my site, I really try and cater to
my users needs, they can contact me if they want something there that
isn't there, if they want something changed, if they just want to ask a
question, using the contact us forum, e-mailing me, posting on the blogs,
using the IRC chat board, I guess i'm trying to offer a touch of humanity.

I'm adding video howto's that can be found on the site, i offer
screenshots, i try to stick to a standard, some people just might like my
way of writing the howto's it's simple and to the point.

It's just another source of information & you can nevr have too much
information.

I never did find anything that said specifically to "use this driver
name", so I just went with my guess and it works. Here are the lines I
added to /etc/modules.conf on my Slackware 11.0 machine:

# Added 7 May 2007 to try to get the sound mixer settings right at boot

Are any PLUG people using CruiseControl on Linux? We want to dedicate a server to running continuous builds and and wanting to administer and monitor those builds remotely. We're thinking about writing our own PHP interface to CruiseControl or using the CruiseControl JMX console and automatically emailling developers about status and failures.

Has anyone had any experience with this sort of thing? Do you have advice or recommendations? Thanks.

I'm interested in the topic -- one of our developers has requested 
CruiseControl become part of our standard server installation -- but 
to date have no experience.

So ... please keep me in any off-list discussions. :-)

Cool :) thanks for putting effort into this.  I don't know enough
about the current state of linux how-tos to comment on whether this is
better / worse than contributing to an existing source, but I'm
confident it's better than doing nothing.

If it's anything like my projects, I'm much more motivated to work on
something I've built from the ground up than to try and conform to
someone else's requirements / standards.

One of my co-workers recently installed cruisecontrol to use with a
project he's working on.  Everything is on windows at this point
<gack> but that shouldn't have to much of an impact on the actual
product.

I haven't used it much, but I have poked around in the web UI.  I
found it to be slightly confusing, but not overly so (the indications
of what I was actually looking at, and what I could click on to
navigate were not as obvious as I would have liked).

It seems to work well though -- the ant script used to do compilations
/ tests needs to correctly report success / failure based on the
status of compilations / tests, but I'm assuming that's not difficult
to ensure.

If anyone has specific questions, I can try to get those answered.

I'm don't have a lot of experience with Java so that this for what it is worth.
I have tried on two different occasions to get cruisecontrol up and
running.  Once I got
it to show web pages but it was too difficult for me to configure the
projects all of which
were not Java based.

When I started at my current company I looked again at these type of
systems.  I tried
three different ones (actually more but the others didn't have the feature set
needed) selected from this web site
http://damagecontrol.codehaus.org/Continuous+Integration+Server+Feature+Matrix

luntbuild
bettlejuice
pulse

For me,the major hassle of getting these up and running was getting
the Sun Java SDK
installed correctly on Fedora.  The next step was finding the
necessary environment
variables that were expected to allow the program to find and use java.

The simplest method I found to getting Java setup for these programs
was to just place
a copy locally for the program since I was going to use a specific
user for doing the builds
anyway.

luntbuild - manual setup, manual project configuration, manual
administration.  Never was
able to get a project configured.
Bettlejuice came with it own embedded version of java so that issue
was removed but
it wanted to be installed in a specific location running as root.
Configuring projects was not intuitive mostly manual.

We eventually settled on pulse.  Getting this setup and running after
the experience of
doing the others was simple.  Once I got a project up and working,  I
could turn over
the admin of the server to a manager.  It was that simple to use.

Ted,

   You can pipe a properly-formatted message through 'mail'. I suppose that
you could write a script in whatever application you're thinking of using
that sends the mail commands for the user.

And here I thought you had gotten the automated mailer working 
already :-D

As Rich said, you can pipe to `mail` or `sendmail`.  If you're in Perl, 
there are libraries which do that and even some which do SMTP directly 
with varying sorts of authentication, relay support, etc.  The 
advantage of using a library which directly supports the protocol is 
pretty clear if you need it to also run on qdos and such.  Of course, 
it could also be good to gloss over the issues of varying distros and 
mis-configured sendmails.  The disadvantage is of course that sysadmins 
with properly configured sendmails will be annoyed by your program 
requiring them to re-type their configuration.

I wonder if the Perl code that emulates SMTP actually works with sites 
that use Greylisting.  Does the Perl SMTP code actually queue and resend?

Here's a perl function that will do as Rich suggested (i.e. opening a pipe
to a mailer program).  The body is passed in as a string.  For tightest
security, it is best to hardcode the recipient at minimum.  If the
recipient were a function argument, it would be more possible for a hacker
to exploit the function as a mass mailer.  With a hardcoded recipient, it
can only spam one person.

sub send_mail {
    my $body = pop(@_);
    my $to = $SENDER;
    my $from = $RECIPIENT;
    my $subject = $SUBJECT;
    my $sendmail = "/usr/lib/sendmail -t -oi -f $to";
    open(MAIL, " |$sendmail") || die "Can't start sendmail: $!";
    print MAIL "From: $from\n";
    print MAIL "To: $to\n";
    print MAIL "Subject: $subject\n";
    print MAIL $body;
    close(MAIL);
}

This sends an e-mail with subject "Latest release".  The body, "See
attached...", is piped and a gzip'ed file is attached (i.e. mutt does
it all).

You probably also want to use the list form of pipe open or else you'll 
have to quote the $to value to keep the shell from breaking it into 
multiple arguments (not to mention that whole $to="hah;rm -rf /" 
thing.)  Of course, Email::Send::Sendmail has that same bug (though it 
gets irony points for going to the extra effort of creating this bug by 
flattening a list @args.)  To be fair, perl has only had list-form pipe 
open() for something like 5 years now.

I suspect that your code also has a hole in that it doesn't finalize the 
headers before printing the body.  Email::Simple would solve that.

Net::SMTP actually implements (at least partly) the protocol, so I 
wouldn't call it emulation.

It doesn't appear to provide much error handling though, so I think if 
you want to build a proper daemon, you'll have to get your fingers 
dirty.

Maybe better luck with Net::ESMTP or Net::SMTP::Retryable?

Mail::Mailer does appear to get the sendmail thing right.  Anyway the 
general rule is that anything on CPAN labeled ::Simple or ::Easy is at 
least partly ::Wrong or ::Broken.

Perl might be too dangerous a way to send mail for lightweights like
me, given its close interface to shell commands.  It made for a good
example, as it illustrates the problem so nicely.  I wasn't even
trying; I thought my function was relatively secure!  I co-opted it
from old-school perl hackers I used to work with.  Since I'm not using
this function anywhere right now, I'm delighted by Eric's audit.

Using a trusted library is a better move, since the codebase is more
likely to have been scrutinized by many talented coders.  But Eric
shows that there is room for false security here.  One must audit the
code oneself to be sure, and even that is subject to the examiner's
skill.

Perhaps it makes sense to find out which language Ted is using, and
then find the least exploitable means to send email in his language.
If anybody knows the best way to send mail from a common lisp program,
by the way, I am all ears.

The problem Gaim launch is precipitated by either telling KDE to restore the 
previous session, or telling KDE to save the current session.  I would be 
surprised if there is a way to influence when KDE does the restore during 
session initialization.

I believe there are other ways to launch applications on starting a session, but 
I do not know what they are.  My impression is that there are many ways.

One thing I notice is that in the Kmenu System Settings there is a tab for 
"Default Applications".  On that window the Instant Messenger is shown as 
Kopete.  There is a drop-down list, but only Kopete is on the list.  Adept shows 
Kopete as installed.  Should I uninstall it? (A long time ago I tried Kopete but 
found it inadequate for various reasons.)

Well, in gnome, there are obvious ways to define the order in which things
are started. KDE likely has something like that. No idea where it might be
found though...

I don't think this would have any bearing on the problem at hand. Since Gaim
is not really a "KDE aware" application it wouldn't be likely to link into
KDE's application stack like that, which would explain why it isn't in that
list. However, assuming that list behaves it should, it should have no
impact on Gaim's success or failure to start. I still think finding a way to
fiddle with the order that programs are started during your session
initialization is worth digging further into. If I have some time tomorrow
I'll do some digging on my own and post here if I find anything.

We're still thinking about this. What we have now are some lines in the config.xml used by CruiseControl that sends mail when a build occurs and a build occurs whenever there is a cvs checkin.

I have Postfix running on the build box (the advice I got here tells me I don't really need a dedicated mail server, just a client ... I can use the mail server the rest of the network uses).

We want to make it better and are looking at http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net
I hadn't known about mutt ... I think it's cool. Thanks for the great responses.

FYI, here's the blurb in config.xml that sends the mail
      <htmlemail mailhost="halibut"
        returnaddress="ted at halibut"
        defaultsuffix="@halibut"

Please don't invoke sendmail this way.  From Perl, there are safer

Both Debian and CentOS are tributaries of the same open source river. 
You really have to compare Fedora with Debian "sid", not "etch", which 
is where I started.

In any event, my initial goal in choosing Etch and CentOS 5 was to test 
the latest "stable" distros on brand-new hardware. As it turned out, 
neither was stable enough to use. As luck would have it, Gentoo released 
2007.0 on Monday and the machine is more or less up and running. The x86 
(32-bit) version hasn't hiccupped yet, which I think exonerates the bulk 
of the hardware. The x86_64/AMD64 version is flaky but better than Etch 
or CentOS. And it looks like there are some things that require a more 
recent kernel -- Gentoo's 2.6.19 is better than the 2.6.18 in Etch and 
CentOS, and Gentoo's 2.6.20 is better still. I'm running their 2.4.21 
kernel problem-free on my other two boxes, which are 32-bit, so it's 
probably going to get put into the new box as well. Then at least I'll 
have something I feel comfortable filing bugs against. :)

Gentoo is probably the best distro for people who are, like me, in the 
process of kernel/hardware testing. Most of the other distros have

I'm downloading the amd64 DVD of Gentoo now. Nice and fast with the
torrent, should be done in a couple hours. Then I'll try it on my new
desktop to see if it solves the problem I'm having with mdadm and/or
the SATA II controller on the motherboard. Thanks for letting me know
it was available.

I almost uniformily build my own kernels from vanilla kernel.org
source for my Debian installs and they always work for me.  I avoid
the initrd stuff, so I am actually a bit ignorant about getting those
working.

Perhaps as a consequence, when I try to help people who are using
initrd's and/or redhat derivatives, my ignorance tends to lead to
non-success.  E.g., I was trying to help someone with madwifi drivers
on Fedora (I think it was), a having built a vanilla kernel got a
panic during boot.  The madwifi thing is still unsolved.  We tried a
fresh ubuntu live cd also.  Interface is there, but the damned thing
doesn't want to associate.  On my laptop same driver "works for me".

That would depend on the Perl coder and their handling of the 400 (?) series error

PHPMailer should work fine for this.

If you use it outside of Cruise Control you will probably want to
extend the class and make sure that isn't succeptible to header
injection.  I doubt this has changed since I looked at it a few years
ago.

Nope, this refers specifically to gnome-session, and since you're using KDE,
it doesn't apply.

Also, I am about to look for the files described here:
> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2595382


This is also referring to startup services. These come up at boot time, well
before X and KDE load. Also, unfortunately, not applicable.

Surely there's a KDE user on this list that knows if this functionality even
exists?

This link might help:

http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Autostart_Programs#KDE

A quick google for "kde startup programs order" returned a number of
promising links, though this is the only one I looked at.

Subject: [PLUG] SATA II, mdadm and soft power off
Message-ID: <20070511203234.788a80cb.johnxj@comcast.net>

I still can't get my new desktop working with RAID 1. I can create a
small RAID 1 partition, but on a large one I get a sudden power off.

Hardware:
Abit NF-M2S motherboard
	nVidia 405 chipset, including 2 SATA II connections
	Realtek 8169SC gigabit
	nVidia GeForce 6100
AMD2-64 4600
(2) DVD+-RW dual layer on ATA, master and slave
(2) Western Digital 320 GB SATA II 
(2) Corsair 1 GB DIMMs 533
Antec 500 Watt PS with two 18 amp 12 volt rails

That's it. No add-in cards. I use the ethernet and video on the
motherboard.

The problem is is the sudden power off when mdadm tries to set up a
large RAID 1 array. It goes for anywhere from a few seconds to maybe 30
minutes max, then suddenly the whole computer shuts down. No warning,
no log files. It's like someone pulled the power plug out of the back
of the case.

I have:
Replaced the power supply (the original was RaidMax 380 watt)
Swapped the motherboard
Replaced the SATA II cables
Run memtest86 on the RAM
Run Western Digital Lifesaver Diag utility on the hard disks
	This utility does not know about RAID, so it tests one disk at
	a time. It ran for 75 minutes on each drive, no errors

There are three RAID 1 arrays:
/dev/md0	2 GB	swap
/dev/md1	40 GB	Feisty amd64
/dev/md2	20 GB	Empty, formerly Etch amd64

The md1 and md2 arrays check out fine with e2fsck. However, 
half the time Feisty won't finish booting before I get a power off.

Plus I am trying to create another RAID 1 array:
/dev/md3 238 GB	for storage of backups

It is the creation of /dev/md3 that is causing the problems. Just now I
decided to reinstall Etch on /dev/md2 to see if its installation
utility could create the /dev/md3 array as part of the setup process.
The partitioner got to the formatting of /dev/md3 and suddenly I had a
power off again. In other words, there is something about creating that
large RAID 1 array with mdadm that is causing the problem, and since it
happened with Etch, the problem is not in Feisty. I have checked bug
reports on mdadm and the only thing I can find is corrupted data;
nothing like this problem.

I have spent hours googling and have come up with nothing. I posted on
the Ubuntu forums, and got no response. I posted on Abit forums and got
some responses, but they did not solve the problem. And anyway,
abit-usa.com is down more than it is up. I'm guessing they didn't pay
the bill for their net access. I also spent hours googling on "western
digital" +SATA, and on nvidia +SATA, and found nothing.

I have spent hours fiddling in the BIOS hoping to stumble on something
that solves the problem. "Failsafe" and "Optimized" settings do not
work, nor did the original factory settings. The "SATA spread" has two
options, Disabled and Triangular Down. Neither makes any difference.

It is not heat related because the heat settings in the BIOS are
disabled, plus it happens even with the computer is stone cold and has
just been turned on. Several times I have viewed the temp display in
the BIOS and the system and CPU temps never get above 32 C.

*Something* is sending a kill signal to the power supply, i.e., the
soft power off is being triggered. I am assuming it is the same signal
that the OS sends at the end after the user has clicked on the Shutdown
icon. The mystery is what could be doing it. I wish I knew how the soft
power off works.

Any ideas and suggestions welcome, regardless of what wild hair spawned
them.

Have you tried running the smartctl tools on the drives individually? I
think you can get alot of information from that tool. Where I'm going with
this and I very well could be wrong but you can look at the spin up times of
the disks and other raw data. Maybe running Gkrellm while trying to create
the array (inside an already booted system?, I know very little about
software raid). I found a few bug posts about a race condition in mdadm from
back in feb of this year but apparently have been fixed that seemed to match
atleast the booting issues you're having with the feisty install. Sorry this
might not be much help just trying to toss anything out there at this point
to help you out.

There is no kill signal.

ATX Power supplies get a low voltage signal to power on.  If this goes
the other way
the power supply shuts down.  Also there is a Power OK line that must
be on after
a certain amount of time or the power supply shuts down.

There was a thread on the list that had the thermal shutdown setting
at a seriously
wrong level that was doing something similar and was a bear to troubleshoot.

Thanks. So when I press the button on the front of the case it sends
the low voltage signal to the power supply and it turns on. If I press
it again it sends another low voltage signal to the power supply,
right? So the low voltage signal is a toggle? How does Linux tell the
computer to shut down? There must be some software command that "pushes
the button on the front of the case." For that matter, there must be a
software command that can turn on the power supply without pressing the
button also, else how would wake on lan work? 

I'm trying to understand this clearly because the symptoms I have are a
sudden power off, just as though I pressed the button on the front of
the case. It happens when mdadm and/or mkfs has the hard drives running
full bore. I'm assuming that if I can understand what happens when the
computer shuts down it might help me figure out what is wrong. 

Of course, what could be wrong is a buggy nVidia SATA II controller. Or
the problem could also be a user who is too stupid to take the Abit
motherboard back to Fry's and buy something else. :)

I remember that thread. But in this case the thermal shutdown settings
in the BIOS are disabled. Unless there is another setting somewhere
where I haven't found it.

The button on the front is not a toggle but the closure of the button
(press) is detected by
 the motherboard which sets the signal either high or low.  Once the
power switch to the power supply is on then there is always
some power to the motherboard. Yep, that is part of the way/reason wake on LAN
stuff works.  From the software point of view it is just a IO port
mapped hardware bit.

Once the OS has come up,  the front panel power button is under
software interrupt
control.  That is why it takes from 3-10 seconds of holding the button
to get a system
to shutdown.

Linux does the same thing as Windows or any other OS using PC
hardware.  It writes
to a well know IO address that does tells the power supply to shutdown.
If some knows the address just say.  I don't remember and my google
search didn't hit it
on the first page.  I could find it by tracing the /sbin/shutdown code
from user space to
the kernel system call down to the putb IO command but thats overkill.

Software writing to a wrong location (or just plain bad software) or
worse the mapping
of the io address is in conflict with something the driver normally
does to the HD interface
and causes the power down.

That is possible, too.  More likely is a combination of SATA and Linux
driver issues.

I just tried smartctl with a rescue CD and it said "device does not
support SMART" and "Error counter logging not supported" and "Device
does not support self-test logging." I'll have to study it more to see
if it can tell me anything.

Gkrellm wouldn't run because I was at a command line on a rescue CD.
The attempted installation of Etch messed up something and I can't get
Feisty to boot. Got the infamous "job control turned off" message.
Gotta go to Ubuntu forums 'cause I can't remember how I fixed it last
time.

Since you are confident the system is not overheating, and your power 
supply is more than adequate, that seems to leave two possibilities. 
Either a software shutdown is occurring, or electrical noise is 
coupling into the power control circuit.  Here are some things you 
could try to help determine the problem.

Rather than trying to build an md array, try running iozone or bonnie 
on both disks simultaneously.  If you can make it fail this way, then 
the problem is not md.

Connect the power supply enable signal to ground.  This will force the 
supply on, regardless of the front panel switch or motherboard.  If 
you can build the md array and run without crashes with power supply 
forced on, this would suggest that electrical noise is causing the 
power supply shutdown.  The power supply enable signal is on the power 
supply connector.  If you want to try this, send an email and I'll 
give you instructions.


Personally, I think I would start shopping for a different motherboard.

I'm quite convinced that it's a bad power supply.  
Sometimes you get two in a row.

I suspect you'll see the same thing if you run some sort of disk
operation on all the disks at the same time, e.g.:
  dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null &
  dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/null &
  dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/null &

The FreeGeek thriftstore might let you try it out with one of their
power supples.

Well, I would say that smartctl is not very smart.  All SATA-II drives
support S.M.A.R.T.
It is possible that the command interface to get the info has changed
and smartctl
has not kept up-to-date.

Only recently has SATA SMART been supported.

Last night, after fixing Feisty, I searched in Synaptic on "SATA,"
which turned up hddtemp, a utility to find out the temp of the hard
disks. It said that one of them was 48 C and the other 52 C. The BIOS
sensors always report the system and CPU at around 30 C, so I never
considered those issues to be a problem. But I don't know if the hard
disks might have a temp shutdown feature. I can't find anything at
Western Digital. Those temps surprise me. They're not outrageous, but
higher than I expected. The side panel is off the case, so maybe the
designed airflow is not happening properly.

Thanks for that suggestion. I had already deleted the array that the
aborted Etch installation created, but the partitions were still there.
So first I went into Gparted and deleted the partitions, then recreated
them as individual partitions (238 GB, no RAID flag) and formatted them
ext3. That went smoothly. Then I ran iozone -a /dev/sda4, followed by
the same command on sdb4; that is, I ran each one just on one disk at a
time, not simultaneously. Interesting, iozone quit after about ten
minutes and said:

Error writing block 2640, fd= 3
iozone interrupted
exiting iozone
Timer resolution is poor. Some small transfers may have reported
inaccurate results. Sizes 2048 Kbytes and below.

The exact same error message happened on sdb4, except it was block 2638
instead of 2640.

Right after running those tests I ran hddtemp again. It said they were
42 and 45 C. So maybe that's not so bad.

Then I opened another tab in the terminal window and ran iozone -a on
both drives simultaneously, starting with sdb, each command running in
a different tab. The sdb quit after a couple minutes with "Error
freading block 344 #6400000; read: invalid argument." The sda drive
continued for 6-7 minutes longer, then gave the same error as above,
except the block was 2640.

There was no sudden power off, but two or three minutes of running both
drives at the same time is not a good test because running mdadm I
could get longer than that as well. However, it appears that I am not
going to be able to run them both simultaneously with iozone for a long
enough time to make a valid test because of the errors. That is
troubling, because the partitions were just created and formatted a few
minutes ago. Plus, the Western Digital utility reported no errors on
either disk after testing each one for 75 minutes (separately, the
utility can do only one drive at a time).

So then I booted to the Ultimate Boot CD and tried the Western Digital
diagnostic again. This time it said it could not continue because there
was a non-Windows boot sector. Odd, because it was there last time as
well and the utility ran without a problem. However, I decided that
maybe I should use a different utility anyway. I am currently running
mhdd 4.6 on one of the drives. It has run for about 20 minutes (21%
finished) and has found no errors so far. It will be a couple hours
more before it finishes running on both disks because it can run on
only one disk at a time.

I am assuming both drives will come up clean in mhdd. If so, I have no
idea why iozone gave the errors.

Saving this suggestion for later.

Already googled a bit last night. The Asus M2NPV -VM is a good bet and
is available at Fry's for a few bux more than I paid for this Abit.
Much better features, and I didn't find any show-stoppers for Linux.
There are still some issues, such as your suggestions to check out
further before giving up on the Abit. It might be the disks. Or the
phase of the moon.

In the world of computers, anything is possible. But one was the PS
that came with the case (RaidMax) and the new one is an Antec.

I thought of that, but I'm not sure if the PS units they have would
have the proper connectors for this motherboard, plus it needs 12 volts
separately for the CPU with a funny four-pin square connector I've
never seen before. 

As for the disk operation, I'm currently running mhdd from the Ultimate
Boot CD. No errors so far, but we'll see how it goes. I think Galen is
right and I need to run something that tests both disks at the same
time to see if the problem is in mdadm or in the controller. So far it
appears that there is no problem with the power running either disk by
itself.

Is the power for the drives thru the motherboard or direct from the PSU?

 <snip!>

     John, these errors sound suspiciously like a data corruption
error that was reported on the Linux Kernel Mailing List, some
time back.  The gist of that problem was silent corruption of one
or two data blocks during disk transfers.  This corruption only
happened rarely, and had to do with the BIOS memory hole
setting.  (!?!)  The culprit there seems to have been the
nVidia nForce4 motherboard chipset.  Somehow, the on-board
hardware IOMMU (I/O memory management unit) would cause the disk
transfers to go bad, but only if the system had at least 4GB of
ram. The workaround, as I recall, was to disable the hardware
IOMMU in the BIOS and configure the kernel to use a software
IOMMU instead.  (I'm recalling this from memory, and I'm afraid
I've lost the URL, sorry to say.  But it was a _long_ thread,
which started at the end of 2006, I think.)

     Granted, you don't have that much memory, and I doubt that
it's the IOMMU, but it's still suspicious.  I'll have to agree
with Galen here, I think it's time to look for a new motherboard
-- one without nVidia chipsets.  (Not to be confused with their
graphics chips!)  It's possible you could have gotten two bad
power supplies in a row (hey, it's happened to me), but it's
really unlikely.

     Anyway, good luck!

--Dale

Directly from the PSU. And since the new Antec PSU has two 12 volt
rails it has two SATA power connectors, each with two plugs on it. I
connected each drive to a different one, presuming that this means each
one is on a different rail. 

As for mhdd, it finished. The first disk ran nicely until it got to
around 80% with 99.99% of the blocks <3ms, then  suddenly the number of
blocks that were >3 and <10ms increased dramatically. At the end there
were three blocks that were >10 and <50ms. The average speed was about
80,000 kb/s. The second drive also did fine until about 80%, then the
number of slower blocks started increasing dramatically. At the end it
had 759 >10ms and <50ms, and the average speed was only 64,800 kb/s.
However, mhdd did not announce any errors as such. That is, it may have
been slower on one drive than the other, but evidently it finally read
all the blocks correctly. 

When it finished the second drive I decided to do a scan with the remap
switch on, starting with the second, slow drive. When it finished it
gave me more or less the same results as when I ran it without the remap
switch. I've scoured the scant documentation and forum for mhdd, but I
can't find anything that tells me how slow a block has to be before
mhdd will remap it, or if there is a way to change the threshhold.
Evidently 50 ms doesn't trigger a remap.

What bothers me about these results is that the second drive is quite a
bit slower than the first one. And timing was one of the things iozone
was bitching about.

Of course, a sane person would just get a new motherboard. I paid $70
for the Abit and the Asus I found online is $84 at Fry's. If I bill out
at $40 an hour (I'm cheap), the 10+ hours I've spent on this so far is
ridiculous. But see, that isn't any fun. It's much cooler to be able to
sleuth down an obscure problem. It's like a giant sudoku puzzle, with
teams. On the one side there is Abit, nVidia, Western Digital, and a
host of others. On our side we have cool smart people. Of course, we
also have Linux on our side, so ultimately we will win. But that
doesn't mean it won't be an exciting adventure with clouds of bits
a-flying. And the frosting on the cake is the extra knowledge I will
gain from the experience. 

But I do have my limits. At some point I will pull the plug and go get
a different motherboard. :)

This won't help you but Abit is evil .. I bought 1 of their mobo's and had
so many problems with it I gave up forever on them. I buy almost exclusively
MSI now and have never had a single problem with any of their gear, I've
also had good luck with Asus stuff too, except for a video card that started
showing artifacts after 2 days.

I have since run Vivarrd on both disks, scan + remap. It also failed to
find any errors on either disk. And it also reported the second disk as
considerably slower than the first one.

I believe you.

Tell me something. Is it just me, or is Abit's site still not working

Abit's site is notoriously  inaccessible.

Looks like they have at least two updates to the BIOS of that motherboard with
at least 5 known fixes and probably several un-published fixes also.
It is worth a try to
upgrade the BIOS.

Thanks, I downloaded it. But before I go to the trouble of figuring out
how to install it (no DOS here, no floppy), it seems to me that this
motherboard had the latest BIOS available when I bought it.
Unfortunately, I cannot verify that now. The initial splash screen that
comes up says Phoenix-Award Bios 600PG, and no date. The file I
downloaded has a date (2/27/2007), but no version number. Clever of
these Taiwanese, eh? And going into the BIOS setup screens there is no
hint of a version or date.

Is there by chance a way to find out info about the BIOS from inside
Linux?

The dmidecode package has biosdecode along with it. Doesn't show the right
info on my dell 1525SC but should work on your board.

No but I believe that the Sysrq key (or ctrl+s) at the BIOS screen
will pause it.  The
BIOS rev is at the bottom of the screen.

The last time I had to upgrade a piece of hardware, I had to make a
bootable CD with
FreeDos.  Write the BIOS file to another CD and play the swap game to
run the flash
utility.  The machine only had a CD and Linux was the only OS on it.

Ah. That worked. And dammit, I have the 1.1, so I guess a BIOS upgrade
is the next thing to try.

I will try that, but it will have to wait until later. I have to devote
tomorrow to a midterm that is going to happen at 8:30 Monday morning.
Someday I may run for elected office on a plaform of abolishing exams
at that hour.

I'm amazed that Abit evidently thinks their motherboards are used in
computers that have floppy drives.

Wait ... I just realized that I have a floppy drive I can steal from an
old box sitting in the closet. Now if I can find a floppy I'll be all
set.

Pretty much all boards do, it's not just ABIT.  There may be one or two 
out there, but you have to do offline BIOS updates somehow.  You could 
probably make a DOS bootable CD with the BIOS update on it and do it 
from there too.  You won't be able to backup the old BIOS, though most 
don't anyway.

Dell is doing some interesting work on tools for vendor and
package-format neutral firmware/BIOS updates:

That sounds like a much more modern approach. What amazed me about Abit
was not that their motherboards had a plug for a floppy and that the
BIOS could recognize it, but rather that they thought users could use a
floppy to flash their BIOS. Instead of a zip file with instructions for
making a bootable floppy, they should have provided an ISO and
instructions for burning it to a CD. They could even make a few bucks
by offering to sell the CD to users who prefer not to have to learn how
to burn an ISO. 

Or as an alternative, make the BIOS flash an internet thing. I can
upgrade the firmware in my HP Laserjets over the internet, why not the
BIOS in my computer? Floppies are so last millennium. The internet is
now.

Indeed, most modern systems will boot from USB mass storage (and even
emulate a floppy device), so it is handy to keep a bootable USB drive
around with syslinux and a couple different boot options, including
DOS.  It is a little tricky to get set up at first, but you pretty
much just have to do it once.

and several of you responded.  I was about to place a group order with
a Taiwanese company that doesn't answer email and requires payment via
international wire transfer when I found a source on the East coast.
They charge $106 instead of $99, but they take CC payment (so you
don't pay transfer fees and have recourse if it's not as advertised)
and presumably shipping will be much cheaper.

I've ordered one, and will post a review as soon as I get it.  Those
of you in on the group order (and bcc:d) will, I'm assuming, prefer to
get your own.  You can even wait for my first impressions if you like.

Here's an old message of mine describing how to put a bootable FreeDOS

Well ... it's been a week of hacking, but I finally have the thing 
stabilized. Apparently Windows will run on this motherboard with only a 
single 1 GB DIMM, but Linux won't. The motherboard manual doesn't say 
you need to pair them, but apparently you do. Either that or 1 GB wasn't 
enough and the kernel was getting into trouble when asked to manage 
memory. I think it's a little of both, but for now it's solidly running 
compiles and kernel builds without crashing. Once I get Gentoo all 
recompiled I'll run some RAM stress tests and see if I can find 
something in the kernel I can reproduce.

Onward and upward to bigger and better things -- Debian "sid" has the 
Kernel Virtual Machine packages, and the Athlon64 X2 is showing the 
"svm" flag, which indicates that it ought to work. So ... I think I'll 
play around with that.

Nice, those are useful instructions.  I know there is a Windows tool
from HP that accomplishes most of that automagically, though I've
never tried it with FreeDOS.

Does anyone have recommendations for a web-based bug tracking system?
We're currently using TestTrack for some projects in-house, so that
has the benefit of familiarity, but it's proven to be very
temperamental, particularly through the web UI.  Additionally, only
about half the devs have been using it, so I'd like to consider
something else for a new project that we're starting on.

I've used Jira, and been happy with it, but we don't have a budget for
this (so the Fog Creek tool is out too).  I have bad memories of
Mantis and Bugzilla, but it's been a while, so if anyone on here feels
strongly about those as quality tools, then I'll revisit them.  In the
past though, I have found it extremely difficult to search the bug
databases for projects that use either tool.

Trac is the best option that I know of, but honestly, we don't need a
wiki, and we especially don't need another markup language to learn
(we use a twiki for most of our internal documentation).  This could
be mitigated with a Trac WikiProcessor, but it's still solves a lot of
problems we don't have, and it doesn't look easy to trim the system
down so that it's just a bug tracker.

Thanks,
Rogan

Inspired by a recent nonsense post about the value of two 500GB drives
and an imminent laptop upgrade for my wife, I'm interested in finally
purchasing a good home backup server (and place to put all my
non-critical but large files, like ISO images).  The requirements I
have identified so far:

- Gigabit Ethernet (bonus would be built-in gigabit switch)
- Small and hopefully low-power/quiet
- Compatible with Linux, OSX, and Windows
- Potentially hacker-friendly, but more importantly easy to maintain

That last one is important to me, because while it is interesting to
hack on my WRT54G, most of the time I just want it to work.  For that
reason I'm leaning toward an embedded system, rather than a small
Linux box, since I don't want to manage yet another system.

Anybody have any thoughts to share?

Jason

I use Trac/Subversion for IT configuration management. Key things I 
like:

  * People can browse source code without having to check it out. That
    may not be important in your situation, but it's great for sysadmin
    stuff, e.g., people who want to look at the aliases file.

  * When tickets are different in terms of particulars but share
    similar themes, a wiki page is a great place to document
    the overlap. Since tickets use wiki markup, building links
    to the wiki page, related tickets, and, if necessary, the
    underlying source code is easy.

  * I've yet to see a body of source code that can't benefit from
    meta-documents that discuss organization, code style, future
    plans, known errors, etc. The Trac wiki is superb for that.

  * It's true that Twiki's markup is somewhat different than Trac's
    (which is MoinMoin-based), but our own internal conversion was
    very smooth. I wrote a LastModified macro that duplicates Twiki's
    nifty last-change feature -- and my Python skills are next to
    non-existent. :-) Our Twiki users were able to migrate to Trac
    quite easily.

Mantis has grown a lot in the last couple years. Check it again before
knocking it off your list. I host a few instances of Mantis, and it's
quite painless. I'm also a user on few of them, and it works for me. If
you decide to go that way and want multiple domains, contact me for a
simple patch that allows you to maintain one codebase for multiple
domains with separate databases.

Bugzilla 3 just came out, but while I didn't mind using it, it was a
serious pain to install and manage. I hope it's better now, but it's
almost certainly not as easy as Mantis.

The problem isn't migration per-say, but we won't be able to get rid
of the twiki any time soon (it has many hundreds of pages, and we just
cleaned out the cruft 3-4 months ago), so we'd have to know multiple
markup languages, which is just frustrating, particularly since it's
such a relatively minor thing.

This is a topic of great irritation to me.. I use twiki, mediawiki,
wordpress, markdown, LaTeX, and Movable Type regularly, and generaly
it's not been possible to configure the markup syntax for any of the
tools.  Movable Type is the exception, since it actually stores the
initial markup and has hooks to pre-process the content, so I'm able
to use Markdown to edit posts, and the wiki-style formatting will
round-trip from emacs to the blog and back.  I find it irritating
because it really shouldn't be a problem with any of these tools.  The
markup ought to be fully configurable on a system-wide or
installation-wide basis.  (Making it a user preference would be even
better, but that requires a mapping to <personalFormat> from whatever
the canonical form is... which is significantly harder.)

Until they specify which patents they are talking about, it is just FUD.

Novell needs to post a list, since they seem to have the inside track on 
this sort of thing.

This Groklaw article does a great job talking about the article:

Noise.  Not much different from the same crap they tried back in 2004.
Back then, OSDL said, "just try us" and it died down.  Even Fortune
seems to be portraying it as sabre-rattling.

Don Marti put it well, last time this came up:
  Making noise about "Intellectual Property" is what _dead_ IT companies
  do.  And paying protection money over ill-defined threats is what _dumb_
  IT customers do.

Not sure if this is even relevant as this is a Windows ASP.NET based tool,
but if someone internally recommends Version One, I'd suggest avoiding it
unless your team is very large (I'd say 15 devs is the break even point) and
you use agile dev practices. If you don't meet those two requirements, the
management overhead and learning their vernacular is not worth it. We tried
it at my company and it ended up taking longer to manage projects than to do
them. We too are looking to migrate to something else. I've recommended
etiher Jira or Trac, but it looks like we're going to be using the tool that
is built into MS Team Suite. I know, us sysadmins just don't hold the power
with the dev team that we should....

Based on the reading I've done, I'd second the recomendation for the Buffalo
product. Another option that may be interesting is the Drobo.
http://www.drobo.com. It's USB only AFAIK, so it would have to be shared via
a host computer, but if it does all it claims to, it makes maintenance about
as brainless as it could possibly be. That might be enough of a win to make
it worth hanging off of one of your existing systems rather than having a
dedicated device.

I have been trying for the last couple of hours to flash the BIOS. I started by hooking up a floppy that I purloined from an old box that was in the closet. I couldn't get it to work. I replaced it with a floppy from another box (different closet). Still no go. 

OK, to hell with the floppies. I whipped out my 512 MB Sandisk Cruzer and proceeded to use the instructions above to make it bootable with FreeDOS. All the commands went appropriately, but it will not boot. (Yes, I fixed the boot order in the BIOS so it will boot from the removable before the hard disk or CD.) I did the same on my laptop, and it still won't boot to the USB stick.

Any suggestions?

I suspect the dude's confoozled.  I didn't see anything like that in
their ToS.  Though maybe (a) some scammer is pretending to be
Photobucket and seeing how many folks they can sucker into installing
their spyware or (b) Photobucket tracks what webpages are using their
pictures through referrals, and dude thought that meant spyware.

It's nice hosting one's own images.  When folks start using your
pictures and leeching your bandwidth, you can have fun with mod_rewrite:

Something I've found helpful is to not introduce new *software* to a  
team, but instead introduce new *process*. If your devs are ignoring  
duties in tracking/documenting their work, and you introduce a new  
system that "will be used for generating metrics used in performance  
reviews", that is suddenly a totally different beast than "hey, look,  
yet another system to track our outstanding bugs", of which coders  
have seen, oh, more than a few. :)

> I have bad memories of

I love mantis, but hate bugzilla. It's a balance of granularity, ease  
of use, and purpose. Mantis isn't suited for maintaining 17  
concurrent releases of software versions, and bugzilla excels in this  
field, but fails to be a "20 second tool" for quickly entering and  
disposing of issues.

Could you be more specific? I find myself often using the "related  
to" mantis feature to do things like XREF cache bugs, 304 bugs, and  
Expiry bugs.

The biggest *process* problem I run into is when the CXO can enter  
bugs like "website broken" or "something isn't working right", but  
that's more of a process issue. In such an environment, an  
entomologist is needed, a dedicated bug hunter, tracker, and  
classifier, in order to hand out (and annotate, verify, and clarify)  
bugs to those who can fix issues. Or alternately, only allow the  
folks who program to fill out the online bug system, but allow others  
to 'submit bugs' to the entomologist.

Actually the poster is probably referring to the privacy policy, which
is #included in the ToS and includes using tracking cookies, which are
considered spyware sometimes, depending on who you ask.

Personally I like the part about "thou shalt not spoof TCP/IP
headers".  Good luck with that.

We're looking for something relatively simple.  That is, the number of
things that need/can be specified for a given bug will ideally be
small -- in the half-dozen or so range.  A bare minimum is probably:
severity, state, description, reported by, assigned to, entered date,
and the ability to attach files of mixed types (screenshots, data
files, etc.).  It would be nice to be able to specify milestones, but
the options presented by mantis are overwhelming.  (Before decrying my
reluctance to have a field to hold the "bounty" for a bug, or the
iteration, sub-iteration, build number, sub-build number, and XP Pair
programmer's favorite color, please bear with me.)

Almost all of the projects we conduct are very, very small teams (2-3
people), and very short-term.  The complete life cycle of a code base
rarely exceeds 8 months, because our funding comes in 6-9 month
chunks, and usually only about 3 months are actually dedicated to
development.  It really isn't worth the time to figure out how many
iterations we're going to have for most projects -- but we *do* need
some way to easily keep unique id's on all of our bugs, and a place to
put reproduction steps.

Unfortunately, I'm actually the "new guy", so I can't exactly wave
threats of performance reviews. (I'm also "just" a dev, not a sysadmin
or manager.) I just happen to be the only *nix geek in the office, and
I'm a picky bastard when it comes to development tools.

I looked at Mantis again today, and still found the interface to be
extremely difficult to use.  All the information I wanted to see (eg:
bug title) was in the middle of a mass of tables in a non-descript
font.  I'll spend some more time looking at it to see about
configuration options, but I'm not impressed thus far.  It may just be
that Mantis is more focused on the *management* of bugs, and less
focused on the *content* of bugs.  This is probably the way it should
be for large projects, but I don't believe that this is the case for
the size of code base we work with.

The search capabilities do seem better than what I remember, however.

That's essentially how we work -- any non-devs who find a bug report
it to a dev.  This is even pretty rare though, since we really only
write prototype code, and the authors are always the ones running
demos. Coding is just a means to an end for us (usually publication).

Thanks for all the advice so far,

Wow.  They are all pretty much a grand.  And replacement 500G drives are 
$400+.  I wonder if they don't allow for use with a user supplied drive? 
  I guess it may be worth it if it can truely and easily automate 
multi-platform backups, but man. $1000...

Well, I finally managed to get my thumb drive bootable and the computer
boots to it. However, I'm having a problem with FreeDOS finding the
flash utility. When I put the USB stick in my Feisty laptop Nautilus
pops up a window and I can see the directory m613z15 and the five files
inside it. When I use the USB stick to boot the new desktop I get an A:
\ prompt, but I can't figure out how to see the folder. In fact there
are a bunch of other files on the USB stick (old homeworks and stuff),
and all DOS sees is its own files. I think I need to mount the root of
the USB FAT32 in DOS, but I can't figure out how to do that.

Off to google on FreeDOS and see if I can find instructions.

And yes, this computer may end up at the Clinic Sunday. :)

Jason,

I suspect that the DOS is simulating a disk in memory.
That disk image is copied from the stick.
If you want to access your flash files, I suggest you copy it into the DOS
image on your stick.
That way when it copies into memory, it will have your files with it.

Hope this helps.

That's what a trouble-ticket (job-tracking, whatever) system is for.
It's been very carefully explained to me that RT is NOT a bug-tracker.

Looking at the USB stick with Nautilus there is a "file fdodin91.img"
which I assume is the DOS image file. But it is just a file, not a
directory. What you say makes sense, but I can't figure out how to copy
the files to the image. There are three other files visible in Nautilus
that I know have something to do with FreeDOS -- ldinux.sys, memdisk
and syslinux.cfg. Do I need to open the .img file somehow?

If you dig a bit deeper on the site you'll see "developer" models that
come without hard drives.  You can then go buy drives with much better
warranties than Buffalo offers on the unit.

Apparently there are tricks to matching drives in a RAID unit: more
than just size matters.  Geometry and the like.  That's something I'll
have to understand when it's my turn to find quiet, reliable storage.

"After booting from the drive, A: is a ramdisk version of the freedos 
image file.  Any writes to A: will be lost on a reboot.  C: is the 
filesystem on the USB drive."

So to see the files on the USB drive, enter 'cd c:', or just 'c:' to 
change your working directory, then enter 'dir'.

No need to muck with the .img file, just put your files on the USB 
stick as you normally would.  They will appear under c: when FreeDOS 
boots.

Sometimes the process gets overdone.

Where I work they started to use Bugzilla.  They are using it not only to 
report bugs, but as a project tracking and request system.

They have so ritualized the process as to make it difficult to get 
anything done.  You have to caluculate due dates, even if you have not 
researched the problem.  They have meeting upon meeting analysing the open 
bugs.  (They figure that if you have more meetings it will get done 
faster.)  It has gotten to the point where you just don't want to enter a 
bug because of all the emotional baggage that has been attached to the 
process.

The hard part of any bug tracking or trouble ticket system is getting 
people to make clear descriptions of the problem.

"Its broken" is not a description.  "That thingy over on the internet does 
not work" is also not useful.  Getting users to write detailed and 
informative descriptions of the problem is a challenge.  Even harder is 
making an impression on them that it is their responsibility to be clear. 
They seem to think that it is somehow the IS department's job to somehow 
determine the true problem from a cryptic and next to unreadable message.

And it is not just trouble tickets.  I have a co-worker who writes process 
specs where it is next to imposible to figure out what tables or fields 
she is talking about due to the terse and cryptic method of writing. 
(Half the time she uses the name of the field from the legacy system and 
sometimes it is the current system and sometime it is an aproximation of a 
field name.  And it is usually using COBOL syntax to add to the fun.)

And don't get me started on "Spreadsheet Worship"...

Well, that sounds simple enough! However, it didn't work. 

A:\> c:
Invalid drive C:.
A:\> cd c:
Drive C: not responding

I think it thinks that c: is the hard drive in the computer, not the
USB stick. That's just a SWAG.*

The last company I worked for had nothing but process for reporting
bugs.  To give a bit of context, I was working in a cube less than 15'
from the data entry people who used the application I was writing,
when they found a bug, this is what happened:

 * They would email my manager, saying something to the effect "it's broke".
 * My manager would come over, walk past me (saying nothing) look at
the problem.
 * Manager would then email them a link to a Word template on a samba
share to fill out a bug report.
  * The data entry person would (hopefully) *not* munge the only copy
of the bug report template while creating a new bug report.
   * Data entry would then email this report to another data entry
person (who was assigned to manage the "database" of bugs)
   * This person would try to reproduce the bug, add a boolean value
to the report, and stick the report on a fileserver with some random
name that didn't conflict with any of the other bug reports on the
samba share.  To keep track of the bug, it was also given a row in a
spreadsheet on the same samba share (which no one else was allowed to
open because of the lack of any locking mechanism.)

 Once all this was done, the process of assigning the bug could begin:

  * at the next weekly bug meeting the managers would decide which
department was responsible for the bug (it could be either
development, or, well, development.)
  * The dev manager (my manager) would then email the bug report to
the selected dev, and we would finally get a chance to see what all
the complaining was about. (at this point, the actual bug would have
been encountered 1-2 weeks past, if not much, much longer.)
  * Once the bug was fixed, the process worked in reverse, with the
exception of actually verifying that it was fixed.  (Yes, no one
actually *ran* the software to see if the bug was repaired, but at
least 3 people had to "Ok" the bug report before it would be closed.)

I didn't work there long enough to find out how long this process
took, but I was assigned a bug on my third day there, which was
submitted by someone who had quit over 6 months previously, and when I
left 4 months after fixing that bug (I had to insert a "<" in a
predicate), it was still open.

Sorry, it worked here, but I have SCSI disks.  As Larry suggested, 
perhaps it is using a different drive letter.  I'm guessing e: or g: 
since you have two SATA disks.  I'd just try working my way up 
starting with d:.  Perhaps someone with DOS knowledge can tell us how 
to determine which drive letters are active.

The four interesting questions that ought to be listed at the top of 
bug-report or trouble-ticket forms:

1. What were you trying to do?
2. What did you expect to happen?
3. What actually happened?
4. Describe any steps you've taken to work around or understand the
    problem.

Example:

I was trying to visit www.vendor.com to order a new widget. I expected 
to see the "my account" page, but instead saw an error message "can't 
find that Internet site." I tried rebooting my PC, but that didn't 
help.


The four interesting questions that ought to be listed at the top of a 
feature-request or enhancement form:

1. What would you like to do?
2. What gets in your way?
3. Describe the priority of this request and any deadlines.
4. Describe any solutions or ideas you've researched.

Example:

I'd like to be able to convert Word docs to PDF, but I can't find any 
such feature on my PC. We've got a contract proposal due on Friday, 
and the client requires PDF submissions. A guy in marketing has a 
program called Acrobat that seems to do what I'd like.

Sounds like the person who came up with that process moved here.

But now they have the burden of testing the process and proving that it is 
fixed.  Not proving to the tester's satisfaction, but everyone else 
involved whether they understand the problem or not.

But that does not close the bug.  It has to pass audit after the next 
full run as well.  Except they space the full runs so close together that 
we can only get one or two fixes in between runs.  (The idea is that more 
will get done if we flog full test runs instead of longer fix and test 
cycles on individual components.)  And since the current process is set up 
in a way that we can only do one or the other kind of testing, it drags 
things out even further.  (We are working on getting a test server built. 
Still trying to scrape together the database space to do it.)

Heheheheh. There are, after all, only 26 letters that DOS knows
about. :)

Thanks all. Le BIOS est flash?. 

Having done so, I found that Feisty now booted without a problem.
Holding my breath I created /dev/md3 of 238 GB. Mdadm is syncing it as
I write this. In the past I would get a power off after anywhere from a
few seconds to maybe 30 minutes max. It has now run for ten minutes and
it will probably take an hour and a half or so to finish. So everyone
cross your fingers for me. :)

Hm.  One *does* ask those questions over-and-over.  I used to simply
tell users to "email RT" when they had a problem.  We also gave users
access to RT to enter tickets.  I'm thinking that a webform at
http://help that just asks those 4 questions (plus, "0. who are you?")
would be just the ticket.

No it just means it couldn't PXE boot.  Go into your BIOS and check the boot
order.  It bet it set to boot from network first.

Drew, 

My BIOS lists my CD as first and Removable Media as second and the Boot
Agent as 3rd with no other choices (except disable). I'm surprised not to
see my IDE drive.

Omigod it finished. It worked! I mounted my new /dev/md3 and all 238 GB
of its RAID 1 glory is working!!!

Do you have another drive you can connect?

Does the drive spin up or make any weird noises?

Is it stone cold?  Is it pining for the fjords?

Sounds pretty dead to me.

Hmm... it does seem like an interesting device, at least from the
video, but at ~$400 without drives or networking... I don't think so.
In particular, all my current (meaning not too slow to handle gigabit)
systems are laptops, so I don't really want to hang it off any of
them.

I'll look into the Buffalo, but is that really the only option out
there?  I guess I'm a bit surprised, I didn't think this would be that
uncommon.

Message-ID: <464A3FA1.7080708@gmail.com>

My consulting company just got a call out of the blue to help a small
local struggling ISP clean up a mess created by the former owners.

I can manage everything but the billing system and the email server
platform.


Does anyone have any recommendations?

It should

1) Be managable by a gui (for future admins after we are done)
2) Support thousands of email accounts
3) Preferable have a "free" version and have support available for
purchase if needed/wanted.
4) Use a db for mail storage (as opposed to the filesystem)



Thanks in advance,


Sean

Ooh.  Sounds painful, with potential for unpaid bills.  Good luck,
define the deliverables IN PRINT beforehand and collect your money promptly.

That's half of the job, innit?

What kind of admins are they planning on hiring?  MCSEs?

Email: Cyrus-imap, usually with Postfix and SASL.
No reccs for billing; check freshmeat.net.

Zimbra is 3 for 4.

No DB for the mail spool, though I'm curious as to why that's a
requirement. The only mail storage on *nix that comes to mind is
DBmail.

Subject: [PLUG] atmel usb wireless + openSuSE 10.2 = machine hangs
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0705152109130.27417@grond.sourballs.org>

This is a new one for me... I've had a Linksys Wireless USB working in a 
machine (running either knoppix, SuSE 6, or SuSE 9) for 5 years.  A few 
weeks ago, the drive died, and with the new drive I figured it was time to 
put a new version of SuSE on the machine.

Long story short, when I load up the wireless module (something which is 
much more troublesome now than it used to be, for some reason) the machine 
locks up solid within 2 minutes.  I've booted the machine into 'safe' 
mode, and put it in runlevel 3 (network, no GUI) to reduce the number of 
variables. Machine will run all day, until I load the ap76_usb.ko module 
and fire up the network (which works, briefly) -- then it hangs within a 
few minutes.  

I'm strongly considering the kernel module, or the firmware, as the 
culprit here.  Any ideas about further troubleshooting or (even better!) 
fixing the problem?

When you boot from the CD, can you mount any of the partitions on
the ide drive?  What happens if you do an "fdisk -l /dev/hda" on 
the drive while booted from Ubuntu?

A lot of things can be wrong - loose cables, bad power supply, missing
boot blocks.  Before you give up on the drive, check the voltage (with
a voltmeter) on the 4 pin drive power cable.  It should be 12V on the
yellow wire, 5V on the red wire, plus or minus 10% or so. 

If the power is OK, and the connectors on the drive and the motherboard
are tight (pull and reseat them, just for luck), see if the computer
will boot from another drive. 

It is always handy to keep a bootable small IDE drive as a spare; you
can get a 10GB drive from the Free Geek store for $5, and load it
with a default Linux distro.  In fact, get two, and practice the 
always fun "dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdb bs=256K" to copy the entire
contents of the first drive to the second (in single user mode).
Now you have a scratch drive that can be destroyed without tears
if an experiment goes wrong (unlike the 500GB drive I toasted two
days ago - always try a cheap drive first!).

If you can boot from the scratch drive, then the power and the
connectors are OK.  Try the old drive on the hdb ide connector and see
if you can read anything off it.   If the old drive is loose and you
can move it with your hand, you can try moving it around gently.  If
the platter is spinning, there will be some gyroscopic resistance. 
If not, try giving it a quick sharp twist in the direction of the disk
rotation;  that might get the motor spinning.  Have a cardboard box or
some other insulated elevated surface to set the drive down on.

After you have been through all that, THEN you can say the drive is
dead.  Drives are cheap these days, and if you need nothing off the
drive you could just give it to Free Geek, but personally I like to
KNOW before I toss a potentially usable drive.

Oh, and before you seal up the system with the old or new drive,
dust and vacuum the insides.  Dust prevents cooling.  Warm days
ahead, and overheating is the main cause of dead hardware.

I'm told but haven't tried with anything other then a floppy disk that you
can put a drive in the freezer let it sit for an hour or so and it may  work
long enough to get anything you need of it. FWIW it worked with  a flaky
floppy for me.

Good call; that might help sometimes. 

I would put the drive in a plastic bag in the freezer, with most of
the air removed.  This will slow the cooling a bit, but it will help
keep the drive dry.  After you remove it, dry it off, and also dry
it off again as it warms up.  Cold metal will suck moisture right
out of the air, and form frost and later dew;  the moisture (especially
underneath the controller board) could lead to corrosion.  If a drive
IS working, a freeze/thaw cycle could make it absorb the moisture
that eventually kills it.   New drives ship with those little "do
not eat" moisture absorbers - that is for cool/hot/cool cycles such
as a drive would experience on a plane trip from Asia, for example.

So think of a freeze/thaw as a flaky toggle switch.  Dead -> Working
(sometimes), Working -> Dead (sometimes).  Do not expect repeated
toggles, but it is worth a try as a last resort.

Process is not a replacement for sanity, or rational thought... and

rejection is the desired end-goal, of course. :)

I believe a commitment to bug tracking process is the 'key' point. A  
bug tracking application is just like any database application. All  
participants using the bug tracking application must be committed to  
using it and keeping the information updated. This is were good  
project management is necessary.

It's the combination of your requirement for gigabit, cross-platform
compatibility, and your (apparent) top-end budget. Most of the devices out
there that have gigabit are geared towards "enterprise" environments and
therefore expensive. The ones that are attainable by mere mortals settle on
100MB, and/or only work with Windows.

My solution to this problem was to build an inexpensive box dedicated to the
task. For less than $1000 I was able to put together about 1TB of usable
storage available via any protocol I could hope for, with 3 Gb interfaces,
that also does my home routing/firewalling.

I would drop the requirement for "DB" mail storage.  Following in MS's

Comcast in many respects.   Could you could elaborate on the "DB"
requirement a little bit?

For ISP level mail services, you're going to have to do some work, and it
will probably involve rolling your own system to a certain degree.


Personally, starting from scratch I'd use a combo of OpenLDAP, Postfix and
Dovecot  as the basis of the system.  You can involve databases (Mysql
Postgres or whatever) in conjunction with standard mailbox formats to
speed up some operations... such enhancements are easily available when
you need them.

GUI, and user facing stuff is available, but you'll have to do some work
to make it pretty.  The major reward is that you preserve the necessary
modularity to switch out or change components without having to deal with
vendor lock in, which is very important when dealing with fancy TDM or SIP
network integration for unified messaging.

I did the same thing, although my solution was more modest. Still, I
looked at the NAS things available and I was not impressed with what
you get for the money. There are less expensive ones available at
Fry's, but I had no idea how they worked, let alone if I could get
Linux on one. I finally decided that a simple box with lots of storage
was the best solution. I spent about $575, not counting the extra power
supply that it turns out I didn't need. That included two 320 GB SATA
II drives and a 19" monitor from Free Geek. For $1,000 I could have
gone up to TB and more than one gigabit NIC. The nice thing about
having your own box is you can put what you want in it.

Just don't put an Abit motherboard in it. :)

If you are going to do your own hardware then for ease of setup and use
I would recommend freeNAS.

Thanks for everyone who answered.

I talked with someone last night who set up a major ISP in Arizona, and
his recommendation was postfix (or qmail) along with OpenLDAP.  He also
recommended using the filesystem over a DB backend for the mailstore.

So he agreed with most of the feedback that I got from everyone else.....

Subject: [PLUG] MySQL - Can't connect except as root
Message-ID: <464C733C.2060608@comcast.net>

I can use the mysql monitor to connect to mysql if I specify -u root,
but not if I specify another user. Using MySQL Administrator I can see
that the other user is there, but the character count for the password
does not match the number of characters I used to create the password.
It appears that I can change the password with MySQL Administrator, but
it doesn't affect being able to connect as that user. And, when I go
back to MySQL Administrator, the character count is incorrect, again.

(This is not a production environment, so I'm not concerned about
publishing the password on this list.)

The user name is bookorama, and the password is bookorama123, both taken
directly from the book I'm using to re-learn MySQL and PHP. There are 12
characters in that password, but when I count the * characters in the
password boxes in MySQL Administrator I find only 8 of them.

The MySQL installation was done using YaST2 on a SuSE 10.1 system.

Any ideas on how to fix this problem?

Thanks.

Dick,
It sounds like the password is being truncated to 8 characters maybe? Try
just using an 8 character password and see what happens.

MySQL creates a hash of the password, similar to what you see in your
system's /etc/passwd (or /etc/shadow) file. While the hash is almost
certainly greater than 8 bytes long, it's possible the MySQL GUI only
shows eight asterisks as a matter of policy (displaying the hash
itself would probably just confuse the app's average user).

Three possible reasons of various sorts:
1. (paranoid) It's a bogus requirement meant to force the choice of a
   particular email server, i.e. Exchage.  
2. (cynical) Someone read about it in a magazine and thought it sounded
   cool.
3. (pragmatic) They meant that they didn't want a standard one-login-

I agree I just setup FreeNAS for the first time. We took an old DL140 and slapped two 750gig IDEs in it and boom we have an NFS/SMB compatible cheap(not reliable) 1.5 Terrabytes of storage..
I am really impressed with FreeNAS. Heck its based off of M0n0wall so it cant be too bad...

I tried a 8 character password, but still can't connect.

I suspect you're right about what the GUI displays. I have a 7 character
password for the mysql root user, and the GUI still shows 8.

Looking further with MySQL Administrator, I discover that the resource
limits seem to default to zero. There are three resources with a number
next to each. They are:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
max_questions   [0   ] Number of queries the user can execute within one
hour.

max_updates     [0   ] Number of updates the user can execute within one
hour.

max_connections [0   ] Number of connections to the server the user can
open in an hour.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the number of connections is zero, then that explains why I can't
connect. When I try to change that number I get the error message:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, there was an error message the first time I tried it, but now it
(MySQL Administrator) will accept changes. The error message said
something to the effect that the changes couldn't be made, and reported
a MySQL error number of 0 (I think).

It didn't make any difference as to whether I could connect or not, though.

Also, I notice that the same lack of resources is shown for root.
However that does not prevent me from connecting as (MySQL) root.

Connect as root and execute this ..

mysql>use mysql;
mysql>select host from user where user = 'bookorama';

it should return the user you created along with whatever host was created
by MySQL Admin

Post that here, and also where you're trying to connect from (are you
actually connecting from localhost?) I've seen MySQL get weird and sometimes
it wants 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost or it wants the local machine name
instead of localhost when I've used some apps on it.

Hmm  I've never seen wildcard hosts but that doesn't mean its not right
(aka I'm covering my behind in case I'm completely wrong which I am atleast
once a week on the list :))

Try adding the user manually when you're connected as root and see what
happens

 *GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'bookorama'@'localhost'* *IDENTIFIED
BY 'some_pass';

edit the above to taste

Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but in all my years of MySQL usage I've never 
gotten a user to connect from localhost when their host setting was a 
wildcard. They could connect from elsewhere, but not locally. I've solved 
this by adding a second user row with host 'localhost'.

I.E. "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'bookorama'@'localhost'* *IDENTIFIED
BY 'some_pass';" as suggested by Drew.

I was on the same line of thinking Aaron thats why I was curious  what was
listed for the host.

Did you execute the command "FLUSH PRIVILEGES" after creating the user and
giving them appropriate permissions in the appropriate database?

The original issue is that Mysql Monitor won't work with a non-root
user.  How about starting with the simplest connection test?  Can you
get a mysql shell in an xterm?  Can you do it locally?  Can you do it
remotely with "-h <host>"?  Once that checks out, your problem scope
shrinks to the Mysql Monitor application.

Yeah, and that's what I use on my little host.  But AFAIK you still need
to have a user account on the system for each mailbox.  If you have
10,000 mailboxes, and you have to add an account to every email server
each time you add a user, it gets a little unwieldy.

That (mostly) worked. I'm not sure what the "* *" just before
"IDENTIFIED" is, and with that in I get an error message. So I just took
them out and it worked. Then, as recommended by Tim, I flushed the
privileges. Now I can connect with the MySQL Monitor.

Thanks to all who responded.

Actually, the MySQL Monitor is what you are suggesting. It is the text
shell in an xterm. Also, I'm not planning on this DB getting any use
other than through localhost. But, Drew and Aaron's recommendations
fixed the problem, so for the time being, I'm happy.

Thanks for the recommendation.

I feel like I'm talking to myself here, but anyway, I finally resolved 
this problem by switching from using at76_usb.ko (v.14 of the 
berliOS module) to using v.13.  The older driver is differently-named 
(at76c503a) and has the firmware statically compiled in.  Compiling that 
and installing it seems to have resolved the hang problem.

Good to know you got it fixed. I haven't had an atmel based wireless nic for
a few years .. I gave up after several months of trying to get it working.
Sounds like maybe its a firmware versioning issue? I've ran into problems
with  the  open source intel drivers  and firmware weirdness so it doesn't
surprise me. Maybe file a bug report with the Berlios guys?

I've only used Dovecot with system accounts (actually, PAM), but I'm 
pretty sure it can use user/password stored in LDAP or PostgreSQL. I 
don't think a login account is a requirement.

I use Qmail +  VPopmail  and its worked well and can be integrated to use
LDAP for auth or you can create default vpop auth accounts that don't
require an actual system user account.

Thanks for the input, guys.. I cannot mount hda ... there is no hda in /dev. Only hdc and hdd neither of which appear to be the hard drive. fdisk -l /dev/hda returns nothing.

I checked the voltages you specified and they are fine. The cables are good.

I booted to DOS from a CD. If I issue an fdisk it says "No fixed disks present." This doesn't look good.

I dont have another hard disk to try and boot from. I will get one.

You know even at my advanced age, I've had only two hard disk crashes. So it doesn't happen very often but it's painful when it does.

No, there is no hda. fdisk -l /dev/hda returns nothing.

Could be your controller died. Try pluging the drive into your secondary 
controller, so it and the cd drive are on the same controller, and see if it 
shows up then.

Hey folks,

Not sure how I missed this, but something interesting is coming up
this weekend that I just found out about it:

  <http://www.pdxbot.org/cms/>

  PDXBot is a robot competition and exhibition held here in Portland,
  Oregon. This years' PDXBot is scheduled for May 19-20.

  Saturday May 19 will be indoor events at the Doubletree Hotel across
  from Lloyd Center Mall. Robot competitions such as Mini Sumo, Micro
  Sumo, Walker Robot racing, Line Following, Line Maze will be all
  indoors, along with vendors and exhibits, too. New this year is a
  partnership with the Portland chapter of Dorkbot , a group promoting
  the crossing of art with robotics.

  Sunday May 20 will be an SRS Robo-Magellan event held outdoors in
  the park blocks of downtown Portland near the PSU campus.

Message-ID: <c834ec80705181509h7386f1a8hc601ada75e6faf23@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone know where I could find a keymap file (or other
combination of settings) for OpenOffice that would make it behave a
bit like emacs?  Retraining my fingers at this point is essentially
pointless... I still do everything else I do in either emacs, or some
gnu readline enabled interface.  I can't use OO for more than 5 min.
without selecting everything, opening print dialogs, saving when I
want to search, or center-justifying the current paragraph.

In the meantime, I'm writing in emacs and pasting into OO ;) (which
has it's own share of problems!! Why doesn't ctrl-v make use of the
same clipboard as emacs? Gah!!!)

Thanks!

Subject: [PLUG] Skype and the yealink driver...
Message-ID: <1179528582.4858.37.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Michael Robinson

I'm trying to get the yealink driver from 
http://savannah.nongnu.org/ to work. My 
testbed for my first try has been CentOS 5.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Problems on CentOS 5...

I had to change yealink.c to include linux/usb/input.h instead
of linux/usb_input.h.  A 2.6.18 and higher kernel change it 
seems.

There isn't a CentOS 5 compatible Skype as far as I can tell.
----------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------
Problems on Fedora Core 3...

How do I get the kernel source code to compile it against?
Fedora seems to have a horrid habit of becoming repositoryless
fairly rapidly.  If anyone is thinking, "why aren't you using 
Fedora Core 7," there isn't a skype download for Fedora Core 7.

Skype 1.3.0 seems to crash a lot and I don't know why.
----------------------------------------------------------------

I'm surprised there isn't an Ubuntu package on 
http://www.skype.com/.  Fedora is incredibly popular, but 
it's tremendously difficult to support it long term.  The
boosters of Skype are making a huge mistake IMHO remaining 
Windows/Mac centric and closed source in my opinion.

Skype on Freedos 1.1 or 2.0, whatever it gets called, would be 
awesome. Picture running freedos with Skype installed via qemu 
on practically any Linux system.

CentOS 5 has Xen, but I'm not familiar with it.  

----------------------------------------------------------------
Problems with XP Home via vmware player on Fedora Core 3...

It was too slow.

I'm running into sound problems.

Activation is a show stopper sometimes.
----------------------------------------------------------------

A workaround that might work is a skype phone with Linux 
built into it already that you plug directly into your DSL 
modem or Internet accessible network switch.  Phillips 
apparently sells a popular cordless skype phone in Europe
that doesn't need a seperate computer running skype to 
work.

I know that Vonage offers wifi based Internet telephony, but
it's $27/month for that service.

My brother Andrew wrote a Java application to talk over the
Internet between two iBooks, but it was buggy and you had to
use the ip address ( which is often dynamic ) to make a call.

Is comcast's hype that their digital phone service is not an
Internet phone justified?

Subject: [PLUG] Automounting of USB thumbdrive.
Message-ID: <464E360B.9000208@comcast.net>

A couple of months ago I bought a thumb drive. The first time I plugged
it into my SuSE 10.1 system a Konqueror window opened showing me the
empty drive. It worked that way once or twice since then. I don't use it
too much, so it's been several weeks since I've plugged it in. Now,
nothing happens when I plug it in. I can still find it with fdisk -l,
and mount it as root, but I'd rather be able to just plug it in and have
it mounted automatically.

During the intervening time I bought a USB IDE enclosure. It doesn't
automatically mount, either, but, since it is normal to have a bare
drive in it, I wouldn't expect it to automatically mount.

Is it possible I did something during the process of getting the USB IDE
enclosure to work that turned off automatic mounting of the thumb drive?

Where do I start looking for how to get it working that way again?

Thanks.

Okay, maybe this is a stupid question, but have you actually *tried*
Skype on Fedora 7 or CentOS 5?  It is entirely possible it will work
just fine (I don't know, I don't use Skype).

What is the *business* decision for either open-source or Linux *in
Skype's business environment*?  Have you done a market analysis to
determine if more support for open-source and or open-sourcing the
application itself will generate more revenue than the cost to support
it?

Virtualization and emulation have I/O overhead that do not lend well

Dunno, if you're going to pay for phone why not PSTN?

This is a flat ATA/IDE cable, right?  You might tweak the cable routing.

I have two SCSI disks (I know, old...) that use a similar flat, 50-pin
cable.  Every few months one or more drives start throwing parity errors
and I have to reseat connectors and mess with the configuration to solve
the problem.  I've found that the SCSI subsystem is _very_ sensitive to
cable routing.  A half-inch one way or another around the power supply,
fans, even steel case sides, makes a difference as to whether it works.

Don't know if it will help, but you might try.  Keep the cable as far as
possible away from the power supply, and away from fans and case metal.

BTW, you've inspected all of the connector pins' alignments too, right?

Best of luck,
Robert

This is just a wild hair and is probably unrelated to your problem. But
I know that there was a change in the kernel that affects USB. I first
discovered it when I tried to scan with Feisty. No go. My USB scanner
used to work just fine under all versions of Ubuntu through Edgy, but
with Feisty it was not only not detected, but couldn't even be found.
The problem is with (memory may not be accurate here) USB-suspend, a
new feature in the kernel starting sometime between the last kernel
that Edgy used and the 2.6.20-15 that Feisty installs. The problem
happens with both 32-bit and 64-bit.

I found that I could scan fine with Knoppix 5.0, but not 5.1. So until
someone fixes the problem I just boot to a Knoppix 5.0 live CD, mount
my filesystem, do my scanning, and then reboot to Feisty.

Does "nothing happens" persist across a reboot?  I think kde is 
watching /dev and maybe /etc/fstab (I've gotten the popup before after 
adding an fstab entry) with FAM (or maybe something more deeply 
connected to udev.)  If it is FAM and the device node (e.g. /dev/sda1) 
is hanging around (i.e. maybe usb_storage module is not unloading), 
then FAM would not fire an event because the directory didn't change.

If root does `fdisk -l` or "whatever that command is that triggers a 
re-read of the partition table" (sorry, memory failure), then /dev/sda1 
appears (assuming that /dev/sda was there and sda1 was not.)

If you don't find something there, you might as well check out the kde 
svn because it ain't in the "handbook" :-D

Subject: [PLUG] variables in apache
Message-ID: <20070519025940.GA31661@gate.kl-ic.com>


I've got a very long httpd.conf file, with lots of numbers wired 
in throughout the file that are hard to maintain.  Any Apache gurus
here?  Some questions:

1) Is it possible to define a user variable near the start of
http.conf, and use it later on?  For example:

----------------------------- FAKE EXAMPLE
IPADDRESS=123.45.67.89
...
<VirtualHost $IPADDRESS:80>
...
<VirtualHost $IPADDRESS:443>
------------------------------

2) Is it possible to take whole chunks of configuration and make
parameterized macros out of them?  For example:

------------------------------ FAKE EXAMPLE
macro WIKI1( SITE )
   <Directory /home/www/$SITE/cgi-bin/kwiki/plugin/attachments/>
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>
endmacro
...

WIKI1( SITE=fredwiki )
------------------------------

I'm sure it is /somewhere/ in the docs, but I couldn't figure out
the nomenclature to search for.

When I use "smartctl --all" on ATA drives gives loads of information.
When I use "smartctl --all" on SATA drives I get limited info that is
equivalent to "smartctl -I".

Are SATA drives dumber or what?

I don't know if they're dumber, but I know I don't get anything at all
with smartctl --all except an error message "Device does not support
Self Test Logging." However, I know my SATA II drives do support SMART
because I get all the info when I look at it with the disk utilities on
the Universal Boot CD. Must be smartctl that is not smart. Or we're not
using the right command line option or something.

As I understand it, if you use the relatively new libata driver you will
have full access to SMART details. If you are using the "legacy" (and at
this point I believe common) SCSI based SATA drivers, you lose a lot of
SMART functionality.

pluggers-

I recently got this e-mail from a person I know (somewhat).  She's looking 
for career-type advice, and what I do for a living nowadays isn't really 
sysadmin-oriented anymore, so I think my answers would be of limited help.  
I know there are a number of you sysadmin types out there, so any thoughts 
you have would be appreciated, I'm sure.

Thanks in advance-

---------- Forwarded message ----------
David-

I gather from some things you've said that you are/were a scientist who 
now does Linux-y system administration.  I am now finding myself in 
somewhat the same situation -- or rather am hoping to find myself in that 
situation. [Ed. note: I think she has an advanced degree in physics.]

In a previous job I did a bit of Unix system administration, and we run 
Linux here at home, but all my knowledge is self taught and as a 
consequence is very haphazard (and I've forgotten a lot, and some of it's 
out of date).  So I don't feel comfortable claiming in an application that 
I actually "know" Linux or Unix or what-have-you.

I had thought perhaps it would be possible to take some classes at the 
local community college, but to my surprise these are non-existent -- the 
local CC instead teaches classes like "How to turn on your computer" and 
"Which thing is the keyboard again?"

It occurred to me that I could take Red Hat certification classes.  These 
are a big hunk of change, but it's also possible, for a somewhat smaller 
hunk of change, to take just the exam.  And here (at last) is where you 
can help.

Do you know what is the general opinion, among sysadmins (or rather their 
employers), of RH certification?  Is it considered some kind of scam?  Or 
possibly a scam that so many people have bought into that it's almost 
legit?  In short, does it actually mean much on the resume?

In theory it's possible to prepare for the exam by studying the 
preparation guide; do you know how feasible that is in practice?  Do you 
know anyone who's done it?

The answer is largely "no" in both cases. When I do this sort of thing 
(like, e.g., for dhcp primary and secondary servers), I use m4, which 
has all the features you request.

The one thing Apache can do somewhat easily is manage similarly 
configured virtual hosts, which can be built using some interpolation 
tokens:

Try using "-d ata" on the commmand line.

Personally, I view _any_ entry-level certification as a strictly
"foot-in-the-door" sort of thing. In my experience, the Linux certs have not
(yet) fallen to the level the MSFT ones were at several years ago. If I see
a cert on someone's resume, it's definitely a positive. However, I would
give more weight to an LPI cert than a RH one. The LPI ones seem to be more
well rounded, whereas (when I looked at them at least) the RH ones tend to
be "how to do task X using RH tool Y".

In any case, having good critical thinking, communication, and problems
solving skills are far more important than any cert.

One aside on this point, Pioneer Pacific has Linux classes. Not sure if
she's in our general area, so they may not have a campus near her, but I
know they are often overlooked.

Subject: [PLUG] wake on lan not working
Message-ID: <200705190944.01852.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Hi all,

I've got a PIII penguin computing box with a CA810E motherboard and
82559 onboard ethernet.  I'm trying to get it to wakeup with etherwake
and I'm at a loss as to why it won't.

I've tried waking it from S3 (echo 'mem' > /sys/power/state) and S5
(power off.)  Nothing.  (The power button wakes it up from S3 and I
haven't seen any crashes or trouble, so the board appears to be well
supported.)

The bios only has one setting about wake-on-lan, which is set to
"Enabled". I've seen some mentions about entering the intel boot agent's
config, but I never see a prompt for that and Ctrl+S as various times
during boot doesn't get me there. (I've also seen something about
onboard nic's not supporting the boot agent or something, so I'm
thinking I am completely at the mercy of the MB bios.)

The board's docs seem to say that wake on PME is supported in S1 and S3,
with a WOL cable required for wake from S5.  Also, that the onboard nic
uses PME.  Thus, the onboard nic won't do S5?  Ok, then why is the nic
fully lit when the computer is off?

If the nic has power, I would think that it should wake from S5, which
AFAICT hasn't got anything to do with operating systems or drivers.  But
even so, why won't it wake from S3?

Is this a linux issue, or a case of the board not behaving as documented?

Well ... let me answer this, since I have some experience in this area:

1. First of all, unless you *want* a career/position administering Red 
Hat Enterprise Linux systems, don't bother with an RHCE. If you don't 
truly want to be a Linux system administrator at all, you're wasting 
your time and your money.

2. Re-read point number one -- do you truly truly in your heart of 
hearts want to be a system adminstrator? Why? Because it pays better 
than McDonald's? Because you're on some kind of power trip? Or because 
it's what you want to do -- it's what you were born to do?

3. OK ... let's assume you want to be a Linux system administrator. If 
you want to administer systems using some other form of Linux, it's good 
training to take the class. If you want a job as a professional Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux system administrator, I'd say it's more or less 
mandatory that you get an RHCE. It's a competitive job market, so 
employers can be choosy. They can require an RHCE for a system 
administration position. I don't have any statistics on how many Linux 
shops are RHEL shops, and how many of those require RHCEs. But unless 
both numbers are growing, Red Hat has a business problem they need to be 
solving. :)

4. I don't know anyone who's gotten an RHCE by taking the test only, but 
I'm sure it's possible. If you truly truly in your heart of hearts want 
to be an RHEL system administrator, spend the money and take the class.

will be a Clinic this Sunday or not - your web page said the next one 
will be Dec 17th. Also, your main meeting topics alway seem a little 
more... hmmm... advanced than what I'm looking for. I tried sitting at

In my case I haven't changed kernels, or upgraded the version of my

Yes, but then, no.

I also had trouble with the All-in-1 card reader I got a couple of weeks
ago. It, too, used to start up digikam when plugged in. And, this
morning, nothing happened when I plugged it in. I tried a reboot, but
saw no change. I decided to try plugging in my camera, which used to
launch digikam. This time, the machine froze up. The only thing that the
machine would respond to was holding the power button in long enough to
cause the power to go off. After powering back up, both the thumb drive
and the All-in-one card reader do what they are supposed to do.

Of course, fdisk -l now reports /dev/sdb, /dev/sdb1, /dev/sd3, and
/dev/sde1, and they look like I would expect them to. /dev/sdb1 shows up
as a FAT16 partition, which is correct for the 512 MB flash card.
/dev/sde1 shows up as a FAT32 partition, which is correct for my 1 GB
thumb drive.

I guess, if this happens again, I'll just power down and back up,
although it feels to MS-y doing that.

Thanks for the ideas.

Yes!  There will be a Linux Clinic this Sunday, from 1-5 at Free Geek.

I even have a handful of gen-u-wine factory-fresh Ubuntu 7.04 CDs in
professionally-printed cardboard sleeves!

Come on by and help us make the world more free and less chafing!

Perhaps the CDs should be displayed in a chafing dish?

I also ordered some of the fancy ones and they have arriven, so I will
bring another handful. I also have miscellaneous other recent distros
that I can burn for people.

It is a linux and specifically the e100 module issue.  I managed to 
reset the boot agent and found that I can wake from poweroff iff I let 
it get just to the grub menu and kill the power.  That's the boot agent 
enabling legacy wol.

So, a bit too much further reading leads me to understand that the nic 
has to be left in a particular state by the driver for wol to work.  
That, and some bugs were introduced in the default etch kernel.  Yay.

Now, what's the deal with the e100 driver and all kernels after 2.6.18 
having really bad regression or something?  And, what's this 
sourceforge e100 code and should I be using that or is it the same as 
what's in the kernel?

Does anybody have wake on lan from S3 and S5 (or at all) working with 
the e100?

Thanks,
Eric

The sourceforge site is where the Intel developers hang out, and the
mailing list there is pretty much the best place to get answers like
this.  The drivers there are typically the latest, since it takes a
little while to get drivers into the mainstream kernel, and also
people may wish to run older kernels on newer hardware.

I also think at least one of the developers reads PLUG.

I am moving my backup server from 2.4.22 to 2.6.18 (quite a leap!).  I

The later 2.4.xx kernels allowed parallel ATA hard drives to be hot

swapped regularly to protect against power faults or enemy action.
I need a swapping alternative - external USB2 enclosures, or swap
trays with USB2 interfaces, are one way to do that.

Not all USB2 to PATA interfaces work correctly with Linux.  Some 
don't work at all, some generate intermittent faults or lockups at
long intervals, some are slow.  I can write 30MB/s to a directly 
connected PATA drive.  The fastest USB2 to PATA interfaces write
20MB/s, and the slowest write 11MB/s .  

I found 10 different systems;  3 enclosures, 3 swap cages, and 4
smart cables.  Most are based on Cypress or Genesys chipsets.  Two
supposedly identical swap cages had different chipsets and different
performance. I got 7 systems to work, 5 tolerably quickly.  A newer
2.6.21 kernel on a Yoper Live CD fared no better on the fastest,
the slowest, or the non-working systems.  I am told that 2.6.21 has
significant improvements to the USB2 code, but I did not see that in
my results.

I did not try any of the external integrated drives. 

The best performance came from Cypress CY7C68300, CY7C68301, CY7C68320,
and CY7C68321 family of chips.  Before you buy any USB2 drives or
interfaces, you should Google to find out what chipset they use.  Note
that older Cypress chip sets, such as the C768013, can lock up your
kernel.  The Genesys GL811E family usually work, but are 33% slower;
however, I had one dead one.  Stay away from JMicron.

mod_macro (http://www.cri.ensmp.fr/~coelho/mod_macro/) looks like 
just the thing - and in my case I can encapsulate the IP addresses
in macros.

Unfortunately, it requires recompiling httpd, which interferes with
yum upgrades of the main httpd code.  The "m4" approach that Paul
suggested will work without changing httpd, but I would have to make
sure that everyone connected with the system worked through the m4
macro process, rather than directly editing httpd.conf .  I third
approach would be to build a Perl script with some embedded HERE
documents.

I will probably go the m4 route for now (I've used m4 since 1981, 3BSD
on a vax 11/780 ), but I will code with an eye towards mod_macro,
which I hope will become part of the main httpd package soon, which
means I can use an upgradable httpd with macro capability.

I do :)

I frequently test suspend/resume and wol functionality of e100. If you have 
found a bug or an issue, please take it to our list 
(e1000-devel at lists.sourceforge.net) or file a bugreport. Currently I am not 
aware of any bugs with e100 in recent kernels (2.6.20/21). The driver is very 
stable, there are not many fixes going in.

for clarification, we have basically 2 versions of the same driver code. One 
lives inside the mainline kernel git tree at kernel.org, and the other is 
standalone and has compatibility code glue to make it work on all older kernels 
(down to 2.4.20 or so). We do this for all our network drivers (e100, e1000, ixgb).

Auke

Forgive what must certainly seem like a noob question.  Those of us

Terry,

   Don't know, but they're not difficult to start to use.

   I've been using pine for a decade; others prefer mutt. Fire them up in a
virtual terminal to start. Their man pages and web sites are a good place to
become familiar with them.

   I've used the O'Reilly & Assoc. Emacs book as a learning tool and
reference; I like it. What often works well for me when learning a new
application is to start using it. When I need some feature that's not
immediately obvious, I go look in the books and on the web for directions.
If I cannot find anything suitable, I ask on this list.

HTH,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] cruisecontrol and tomcat and logs
Message-ID: <1179700755.6928.14.camel@halibut>

I'm trying to look at CruiseControl results with a Web browser and am
having tons of difficulty. I'm running Ubuntu Dapper. 

The difficulty I have is that I want to look at my CruiseControl results
with my Web Browser (Firefox). I'm also running apache and tomcat. The
problem is that when looking at the CruiseControl webapp with tomcat, it
always tries to open a defunct log file. I even brought up the JMX
console and explicitly set the log dir to what I want it to be but to no
effect.

I made a war file for tomcat by entering 

ted at halibut:/opt/cruisecontrol-2.6.2/reporting/jsp$ sh build.sh war

And, as directed, I added an override.properties file in the jsp
directory as follows...

ted at halibut:/opt/cruisecontrol-2.6.2/reporting/jsp$ cat override.properties
user.log.dir=/opt/build.ecf/logs
user.build.status.file=ECFcurrentbuildstatus.txt
cruise.build.artifacts.dir=/opt/build.ecf/logs

When I put the URL http://localhost:8080/cruisecontrol in Firefox, I get
the following error

Context parameter logDir needs to be set to a directory. Currently set to "/home/ted/builds/logs " 
I cannot understand how it wants to be that value (which for a previous project was the correct value ...
something is lingering that I cannot get rid of). 

At the risk of making this post too long, here is the config.xml file
used by CruiseControl

<cruisecontrol>
  <project name="ecf" buildafterfailed="false">
    <bootstrappers>
      <currentbuildstatusbootstrapper
        file="/opt/build.ecf/logs/ecf/ECFcurrentbuildstatus.txt" />
    </bootstrappers>
    <modificationset quietperiod="600">
      <cvs localworkingcopy="/home/ted/workanon/org.eclipse.ecf/plugins" />
    </modificationset>
    <schedule interval="600">
      <ant buildfile="cc-build.xml" target="ecf.build" />
    </schedule>
    <log dir="/opt/build.ecf/logs/ecf">
       <merge dir="/opt/build.ecf/logs/ecf/test-results" />
    </log>
   </project>
</cruisecontrol>

I would be happy to offer sample .pinerc and .vm files, for pine and
emacs-vm, respectively.  It helps to have a working environment to
start.  Are you trying to connect to a POP3 or an IMAP server?
There are different configs for each.

Emacs is a chore to learn.  It took me a month to become proficient,
and that was with a total-immersion crash program (eschewed eclipse
for emacs-jde at my paying job!)  But I wasn't just learning emacs; I
was also learning ecb, jde and xrefactory.  Learning emacs in its raw
form would probably be no worse than learning vim.  Mixing the two, by
way, is still interesting to this day, given their very different
keystrokes.

Your real question, which was whether there are workshops in the
Portland area, is unknown to me, an Idaho resident.

As for the distro path one takes in life, and its resultant effects on
ones learning: I doubt there are many gnu/linux users who jump
directly into gentoo or even vanilla debian on Day One.  Personally, I
started with redhat 8, and stayed with redhat into 9, before moving to
debian.  I experienced at that point what you must be experiencing
now.  I utilized kwrite for all my text editing instead of vim, for
example.  I had to learn how to manage my system without all those
system-config-whatever GUIs.  But it felt good to make the move.  A
year later, the move to gentoo felt good too.  What's next, I wonder?

I was very lucky to have a pair of gnu/linux gurus in my workplace who
offered up many hours of their time toward the goal of helping me
become productive in gnu/linux.  Their efforts culminated in showing
me how to teach myself stuff with google and man pages.  Google is
what eventually led me to this list, where I found the smartest people
in the most gnu/linux-saturated area of the country.  Thanks for
letting me hang out.

Not sure how many of you made it to this, but it was cool.  Lots of
interesting stuff.  Found a source for USB to 3.3V serial converters
(useful for hacking linux wireless access points).

One of the cool, unexpected things was an amateur balloonist that
travelled from Boise.  He launches small payloads to "near space",
circa 100k feet altitude with weather balloon type vehicles.  Does
stuff like take photos, measure temperature or radiation, etc.  At a
particular altitude, the balloon bursts and plummets back to the
ground where amateur packet radio telemetry reports gps location for
recovery.

Sounded like a lot of fun.  Those of you that missed it are truly
misser-outers.

Well, it may actually start working now. The
Pragmatic Programming book I was looking at does not have the right
syntax for the override.properties file (used when you make the war file
for tomcat). It says to give the name of the
logs directory which for us is /opt/build.ecf/logs. I started to see
results when I entered /opt/build.ecf/logs/ (note the trailing /).

This was after reinstalling just about everything. Sigh ... 

BTW, I second Carlos's comment about the quality of the PLUG mailing
list. We have a core group that really knows what's going on. It's a
very prolific mailing list but worth reading. I'm a taker of
information, not a giver, but I have hopes.

Subject: [PLUG] deep philosophical question
Message-ID: <20070521035441.GS12172@merlot.com>

I spent a few days at RailsConf, and learned a ton. But it was a little
frustrating watching the Mac users... Macs just work. Sleep, hibernate,
wifi, Textmate, Quicksilver, it all just works.

I'm planning to buy a new laptop around the end of the year even though
my 4 year old Dell runs Ubuntu just fine. Because sometimes the wifi just
won't hook up, and sleep has never worked under any distro, and the
display blows out every year like clockwork (warrantees are great!).
But there's nothing like Textmate on any platform. Except the Mac.

So there's the freedom issue; Linux is free and OSX isn't. I like
freedom, and I'm willing to do my part to keep it, but at what point do
I just use the best tool for the job and assuage my guilt by working on
free server apps?

Yes, Macs cost more than the basic Linux-capable PC. But if it saves me
30 minutes per day (which is pretty conservative, I think), it will take
me 20 days of paid work to make up the difference. So is it really more
expensive?

I'm used to Linux, my servers run Linux, it will save space in my brain
to use only one OS, I don't like the 'one menubar to rule them all'
thing, etc. Or are those excuses to keep doing the same sub-optimal
thing?

Your thoughts, please?

Ok.  Better than gvim?

And the priceless freedom to hack.  I would love to not have to hack on

Have you tried *using* a mac?  I find that it gets in the way much more 
than not.  How much do you like BSD?  Mac is a broken BSD.  If you're 
using it for anything besides an ssh terminal, it will probably get 
frustrating.  Have fun mounting nfs.  Watch out for the evil 
case-insensitive filesystem.

Possibly running linux on something non-dell would help?  Maybe a mac.

I had a similar thought a few years ago, and I got a G4 iBook. The big OSX
experiment. It was nice, a lot of the fighting I did with Redhat on the

that time, I sat down and really objectively evaluated my usage profile. I

So I dubbed the OSX experiment a conditional failure, and decided to install
Gentoo on it. All that discomfort went away, and I discovered that Gentoo
was not only better for me than OSX, it was better than Redhat had been pre

Flash-forward to today. I abandoned Gentoo (too time intensive, and too
prone to breakage on upgrades) and am now a solid Ubuntero. For me, using
OSX was less efficient for me than Linux, but through it, I discovered that
there was a much better distro for me out there too. In full retrospect, I'd
call that a net win, but not due to any particularly great attribute of OSX.

As far as your comments regarding hardware support, my wireless (a store
brand Atheros based card) "just works", and I don't use hibernate.

But yeah, I'd love to be able to use textmate.... ;)

I want to second both Quentin and Eric's comments.  I did the OSX
thing on a 12" g4 iBook for a year, after being a hard-core linux
user, and ended up on Ubuntu as well.  Ubuntu "just works" as long as
you don't delve to far out from what is expected.. (eg: power
management may go out the window if you decide not to use the gnome,
kde or xfce-desktop packages.) Compared to OS X though, ubuntu "just
works" better.

Every OS upgrade broke my keylayout and emacs installs, and I tried
everything I could find -- emacs in a terminal, cocoa emacs, emacs via
darwin ports, emacs via fink, emacs from source.... (in case it's not
obvious, I'm not into textmate ;)

The filesystem's bizarre philosophy about maintaining case, but
ignoring it would have cost me close to 6 months on my MS Thesis, but
it was in cvs on a different machine (and being backed up).  I did
loose about 4 gigs of unimportant content though.  (Largely because I
didn't realize I had overwritten my documents directory in time to
revert to backups.)

I eventually switched to a T42p and the default ubuntu install gave me
everything I was using on the Mac, and the ability to customize to my
heart's content, when I wanted to.  (and the hardware has been
rock-solid for 2 years)

In my experience, Linux on a Dell is a nightmare -- I've heard of
Linux working well on Dells, but I've never witnessed anything but
frustration in that arena. I'd guess things will improve when Dell
starts shipping laptops with Linux though.

The Intel-based Macs do have hardware virtualization support, and
therefore you can run whatever else you want on them concurrently.
So, for example I currently have Ubuntu and Fedora on mine, running
under the beta VMware Fusion.  You could also install a Microsoft OS
on it if you wanted, or Solaris.

The Macs are expensive, no doubt about it, but at the moment they are
the only option that you can run all those OS environments on
simultaneously.  Doing some comparisons I guesstimated the difference
between a Mac and a comparable laptop from someone else to be about
$200.  The hardware you get with a Mac tends to be top of the line.
Just something to think about when you're talking about productivity.
Bootcamp also provides the option of dual-booting.

I do agree with some of the other folks that the OSX environment is
somewhat like a mutilated BSD.  Running open-source apps under the X11
server you lose some of the so-called elegance of the OSX environment
(the menubar comes to mind).  And I miss having more than one button
on the trackpad.  On the other hand, I love the dashboard.  What would
I do each day without my Chuck Norris Facts widget?

I attended the PMUG meeting last week to try to observe/diagnose some
wireless issues they were having at Ecotrust (where the monthly PMUG
meetings are held).  I was just lurking, so I didn't speak up when the
PMUG leaders started disparaging Linux ("too many variations", et
al).  

Later on in the meeting people started bring up little quirks and
annoyances, where the only available answer was "oh, yeah, that is
annoying ... there isn't a way to fix that" and "call support and
beg".

Free Software doesn't have that problem.  Pick your poison.  I find
freedom (variation and all) more palatable.

FWIW, my T42 thinkpad has been pretty well-supported (suspends,
hibernates, battery lasts 4+ hours, wireless works, etc).

Yes, apple has the upper hand here because they ship one distro on your 
choice of black or white hardware.  Having an extremely small set of 
configurations to target and selling them in large numbers has to be 
easier.  I wonder if a Linux laptop vendor with the same approach would 
get any traction?  From what I've seen of Emperor Linux, they are 
stretched rather thin to be offering the variety that they do and I'm 
sure they don't have nearly the volume of apple.

Think about what it would cost to provide a lifetime of QC'd kernel 
upgrades (e.g. no regression in suspend, X, etc) on every system ever 
sold and what sales volume would be required to support that kind of 
testing.

Thinkpad does seem to do fairly well (there's that numbers game again), 
though the couple of X2n models here are flaky on 2.6.18 wrt suspend 
(and something involving battery charging) on debian.  Then there's 
that whole keyboard thing.  I'm trying to break the esc habit and 
switch to ctrl+C (meanwhile, vim dutifully keeps offering help when I 
forget it's a thinkpad and whack the misplaced F1 key.)  I also sorely 
miss the super and menu keys :-(

On a related note, I just ran across this story, but I see no penguin on 
the linked page.  Did that deal get quietly dragged into the back room 
and shot during the "Microsoft loves linux" Novell smokescreen?

Kurt,

I've been using a PowerBook G4 for about 28 months now. The 
integration you observed between the hardware and software is, in my 
experience, quite good. I've yet to have a native application give me 
fits.

I haven't had the troubles with *nix apps reported by Quentin, Rogan, 
and Eric. Well, let me put that another way. My first experiences with 
fink were so bad that I almost immediately started using Darwin Ports 
instead. On one host I maintain, the local port database inexpicably 
got corrupted and I ended up having to rebuild all my installed ports. 
Otherwise, Darwin Ports has been good to me. Caveat: I don't use local 
X apps, so I can't speak to their usability.

Another caveat: I'm a sysadmin, not a developer. At work, I typically 
fill my desktops with nothing more than a web browser (I use both 
Safari and Camino) and several terminal windows. I lightly use MS 
Office, Preview, a calendaring application, and some administrative 
utilities. I run a dual-display setup, with my laptop LCD and an 
external monitor running simultaneously. Otherwise, I don't stress my 
system at all.

(At home, the story's a bit different: I use iTunes and GarageBand 
quite extensively. But I'm talking about work now...)

In other words, I tend to use the command-line side of OS X along with 
a web browser, and everything works just fine for me.

That said, it's worth adding a footnote. A couple months ago, I had to 
take the PowerBook in for repairs (dying HD). While it was in the 
shop, I used an older Dell Latitude D800 with Ubuntu. Since I keep my 
most important home-directory config files in a subversion repository, 
I was able to check them out and get up and running in almost no time. 
The whole Mac->Linux conversion took less than an hour. Everything 
just worked. Since I spend most of my time in terminal windows, I 
didn't really notice any difference.

(At home, it'd probably take me *much* longer to find and learn 
suitable replacements for iTunes and GarageBand, but that's a 
different story...)

My two cents.

I just bought a T60 and if I understand what you mean by super and menu
keys, they have been added to the T60's keyboard.  Though I have found
it annoyingly easy to accidentally trigger the touch pad with my palm
while typing.  I could disable it, but I figure that my next laptop may
not have a trackpoint (which I really much prefer)

Well, for openers, one thing nobody in this thread has mentioned is that 
the overwhelming majority of Rubyists love Macs. And that's mostly 
because their muscle memory is tied into TextMate. Rails folk picked it 
up from them, or maybe it's the other way around. Had you gone to some 
other conference, you probably would have found a different breakdown.

So ... if you're "serious about Ruby and Rails professionally", whatever 
that means, join the crowd and get a Mac. For me, Ruby isn't a 
professional thing yet, and I don't know if I'll ever get around to 
Rails, and I enjoy hacking, etc., etc., etc., so I will stick with 
Gentoo and Windows as needed.

One other note: I'm sure I'll get banned to PLUG-TALK for saying this, 
but there is absolutely nothing wrong in my opinion with paying money to 
buy a quality non-free software product! There's no need for guilt. 
OpenOffice.org won't do what Microsoft Office does. Firefox is no more 
secure than Internet Explorer. And in the Ruby/Rails world, there's 
TextMate and there's "everything else".

What *is* wrong, in my opinion, is paying for non-free junkware, or 
defending and using free junkware. If a piece of software sucks, 
regardless of origin, junk it and buy or download something that doesn't!

Don't forget the freedom to have something that works the best for your 
needs.  Don't let philosophy become the restriction in other words.  Use 
what works; tool for the job.

What matters in the end is which platform makes you happy.  Linux
users are cut from different cloth than Mac users.  Linux users like
to tinker, while Mac users do not.  If you really want a computer that
you cannot and need not tinker with, try a Mac.  I've worked
side-by-side with Mac users, and I've endured their endless rantings
re: how their little laptops just work right out of the box.  I would
always return fire with how much tinkering I could do on my machine if
I so chose, just to remind them that there is another side to the
coin.  I'd say things like, "Macs are sweet, as long as you like
Aqua."

Hi

I am having a small tar problem..

I  need to move some files from my SCO box to my SLED10 <Suse Linux> box..

On SCO  I do

tar cvf /dev/f0  <file  to be moved>
The disk lite comes on...  And I assume it is writing to sucessfully to it.

I was thinking I could use tar xvf /dev/fd0 <file to be moved>.tar
in a seperate directory to verify it was actually working??
This doesn't work

Is there a better way??

Thanks

Should the need arise, check out Amarok (it's a kde app, but don't let
that stop you from giving it a shot..).  I was a heavy iTunes user
when I was on a mac, and while I didn't buy much music from them
(thankfully, that's a different rant though.)  it did raise my
expectations of a music-manager.  Amarok has met and exceeded my
expectations by a long ways.  (and yes, it just works with ipods and
many other mp3 players :)

Read the Fine Manual, perhaps?

In the first command, you are writing a tarball to a block device
(from context, I assume it's a floppy).  So, to extract it you just
give it the floppy device.  There is no .tar file per se, since there
is no filesystem on the floppy at that point.

But, to just verify that the tar contains the files as expected,
replace the "c" with a "d" (the "diff" option):

  tar dvf /dev/f0 <file to be moved>

If you really want to extract it to a different place:

  cd /somewhere-new
  tar xvf /dev/f0

should unpack whatever files you tar'd in the first command to the new
location.  There is not foo.tar, remember.  No filesystem on the
floppy at that point.

Or better yet, just use rsync and copy the files over the network,
assuming an SCO box has something remotely 21st Century like that.

This just came to my attention, and it seems germaine to our discussion:

Apparently Apple has been mis-advertising their Macbooks -- instead of
"millions of colors" (implying 8-bit or better displays) they are only
capable of 262k colors + dithering (6-bit color).

The article was stating that the displays are faking it, so I don't
think you'd be able to tell from software.  I think to be able to tell
you would need to know the make/model of actual display, which the
article states most MB/MBPs are from a single vendor who doesn't make
8-bit displays except in 20 in. or higher.  The GPU is still running
at 8-bits/color in case you hook up an external display.  I'm not an
expert on this stuff though.

What I gathered though is that most 15 in. and larger laptop displays
are 6-bits/color, so I don't think this is a unique issue to Apple.

Or you can try to display 16 million colors in a gradual gradient
(light grey works best, I've heard) and look for dithering.  It will
generally appear as striping, or checkerboard patterns.

My 7 pound Dell Inspiron 5100 works very well with Fedora Core 5 Linux.
Heck, I even got a working battery life indicator moving from Core 3
to Core 5.  The bigger problem if you standardize on openoffice is that
a document made in the 2.0.2 version isn't compatible with the typical
OO install found on Fedora Core 3.  Oops!  Another problem with Fedora,
which is becoming a growing issue, is short lived repositories.
I think yum is doing more harm than good these days because of how
fast Fedora turns over.  You are almost better off ignoring updates 
and moving one whole release at a time.

Proprietary anything on Linux is going to suck until the producers 
of it are willing to either a) future proof it, or b) support long 
term updates for it.  I have been playing with savannah's 
yealink-module to try and replace a proprietary usb phone driver
for example so that I can move Fedora Core 3 systems to say 
CentOS 5.  I have avoided Ubuntu so far because of the whole 
proprietary drivers thing, but my brother John has adopted it
heavily.

Hibernate is pathetically broken on PC's in general.  I don't
think being a Dell, Toshiba, etcetera has much to do with the
problem.  The people who implement ACPI hardware and write
software, including bios, to work with it must not talk to
each other much.  Apple isn't cloned as far as I can tell,
so there aren't as many apple power management implementations
as there are PC ones.  If PC makers were not afraid
to share their power management designs with the OSS community,
perhaps this wouldn't be such a big problem.

Things that tend to be a problem on laptops are 
incompatible special function keys.  This is easily 
solved by connecting the buttons to the device they 
control directly in a standard way so that you don't 
need to have a special keyboard driver or map.

I have been watching ReactOS, but I am very 
discouraged with the project.  They are getting 
a lot of regressions with each release and making 
inaccurate claims about when new releases will 
come out.  At what point is implementing an NT 
like system that is stable but not 100% compatible 
better than copying something which is badly broken?  
The theory of ReactOS is plug the Windows driver in 
and it will just work.

Freedos is supposed to move to a post 1.0 release.

I found out that I can run Wordperfect 6.0 dos 
using freedos.  It would be nice to find a free
freedos compatible word processor that is open 
office compatible.  Too bad I don't have a 
simple dos based note taking system for what 
someone is telling me on the phone.  A simple
spreadsheet for phone numbers would also be
nice.

A 486 DX2-66 is not the best Linux machine even 
with 20 megs of ram.  Even in tab window manager, 
mozilla 1.1 is not fast enough to access horde 
webmail imp comfortably.

How hard would it be to port mozilla to freedos?

Clearly, the Linux community can improve 
compatibility over time with the diverse hardware 
that exists.  Supporting some hardware sooner 
means proprietary drivers, which IMHO are still a 
huge headache.  An idea I have is to discourage
the writers of proprietary software from burning all
paper copies of their source code and deleting all
digital copies when they are done selling it.

...most of the time.

I've used Macs since '84, linux since '98, and DOS/MS Windows and other 
*nix'es thoroughout that time period. Yes, on a Mac, *provided the tools 
are already built*, the tools often just work. ("-39? What the heck is 
-39? aw screw it, I'll just reboot, rebuild my desktop"..... etc).

If the tool doesn't exist yet on a Mac, it's often an SOL situation, or 
a "port it yourself" situation.

It's a great editor, but speaking as a dev/admin type who has worn quite 
a few hats over the years, I really haven't found an "optimal" single 
platform, or even an optimal single editor. To this day, I find myself 
switching between numerous editors and IDE's in order to quickly 
accomplish my goals, and on some projects, I may find myself using a 
blend of 6 editors and 3 project tools to quickly work on a single 
15,000 line hunk of code.

For me, "best tool for the job" is the first priority out of economic 
neccesity. Professionally, I am not paid to be religious about a 
platform, I am paid to deliver results. If I can do something twice as 
fast by using some proprietary hunk of software, I will do so.

If you lose tools that you *need* to have, yes. If you do not lose the 
tools, and make up for it in productivity, no.

When a client/cow-orker/manager sends you a flowchart in Visio or Dia 
format, for example, they are not always happy if you reject their 
diagram for religious/platform reasons. In such a case, having a "tool 
capable" platform that can run the needed tools is really the essense of 
the problem.

I suppose this is where the newer X86 macs really excel... they can run 
all of the Win32 tools, the Linux tools, the BSD tools, and the Aqua 
tools, which is something that no other desktop/laptop platform 
currently does.

Of course, if you need a dedicated Solaris tool... or a tool that only 
exists on HP/UX....

I will certainly conceed that using more than one OS can defnitely 
increase the amount of cycles required to learn/maintain those tools, 
but for my workload, that's a tad like saying it's harder for me to 
learn how to use both a hammer *and* a screwdriver *and* an oscilloscope 
*and* a swiss army knife... I don't really have an option.

Well, it can be frustrating to try using vim commands in emacs, or 
expecting code folding to work the same in quanta, jedit, and 
dreamweaver, but once you have a large set of tools to work with, the 
amount of things you can apply those tools to, and the choice of tools 
available to fix a problem.... well, having multiple toolkits certainly 
expands one's options.

I bought a 128k Mac in 1984, and stayed with the Mac for about 10 years.
I worked in Pascal and C, and debugged in assembly language. Big fun. It
was about as reliable as Windows2k then. OSX is a lot more reliable. And
BSD prevents apps from crashing as spectacularly as they did on MacOS
[456]...

I remember that part too. I think the Mac is doing well in that regard
now, and the ports library looks pretty good.

There is no 'one true editor'. I use a variety of editors too, but for
small/medium sized coding projects, most IDEs are too fat. I haven't
used Visual C++ for a few years (version 6, I think) and I accept that
it may be great for small projects also now.

Maybe my work is less varied than yours; I don't often find other tools
that can reasonably offer me the opportunity to do anything that I can't
do with the tools I already have. More often there is no tool to do the
job and I have to build one. o the platform doesn't really matter that
much.

I have a Windog machine for the files that I can't get to any other way,
so I don't have to engage in one-sided holy wars. That can cut into the
bottom line.

I thought the Intel Macs could run Solaris in a VM?

My experience has been that the subtle differences betwen various
dialects of Unix force me to move more slowly when making changes. It's
not like switching between a hammer and a screwdriver, that's more
analogous to setting up web servers *and* DNS. Consider the mild
discomfort you feel when driving a van (for example), and then switching
to a sedan, and back to the van. It slows you down. Well, it slows *me*
down anyway.

I'm missing a critical part of the editor analogy, I think. I agree with
the part about the value of having more tools available to you, though.

Thanks for your perspective. I'm considering more options now than I was
yesterday.

The problem is in the clear plastic cover, not the LCD itself.  The

I know this is off topic for this list but I want
an answer from IQ-above-100 folks. :-)

For the past few years I've been fortunate not
to have to support Windows desktops. Now that
may be changing a bit. I need to be able to
disinfect a Windows box without having to spend
any significant amount of time keeping up with
the goings on in the Windows insecurity world.

I want to be able to boot from a CDROM and have
the discovery and removal of viruses and other
critters automated to a high degree. I've tried
the free Ultimate CD for Windows (or some such
similar name) but it doesn't do a good job.

What should I buy?

# from Lucas Nussbaum
# on Sunday 20 May 2007 09:28 pm:

>What's the content of /proc/acpi/wakeup ?

Wow!  That's exactly what I needed to know.  Thanks.

  $ cat /proc/acpi/wakeup
  Device  Sleep state     Status
  PCI1       4            disabled
  ...

So, once I do `echo PCI1 > /proc/acpi/wakeup`, it works from S3.

Recapping, this is what I've had to do.  It would have been great to 
have found this under the search "linux wake on lan howto" about 5 days 
ago.

  1.  Bios must be enabled for wol.
  2.  ethtool -s eth0 wol g
  3.  echo PCI1 > /proc/acpi/wakeup
  4.  echo mem > /sys/power/state
  5.  from another machine: `etherwake $mac_address`

Notes:

1.  Maybe the bios doesn't need to be enabled.  I dunno.  This board's 
bios/behavior is very frustrating -- the nic stays lit even if I set 
"onboard lan: disabled" in the bios!  :-/

2.  Just need to ensure that `ethtool eth0` says: "Supports Wake-on: g"

3.  The echo just toggles the value, so the following is more correct.  
Now, I just need to choose the "correct" place to put it in the init 
scripts.
  grep 'PCI1.*enabled' < /proc/acpi/wakeup >/dev/null || \
    echo PCI1  > /proc/acpi/wakeup

4.  I can't use /etc/acpi/sleep.sh on debian etch (at least not with the 
kernel from linux-image-2.6.18-4-686.)  It appears to have something to 
do with ifdown or rmmod (though manual ifdown and/or rmmod and str works 
fine), but I'm not going to dig around in that right now.

Also note, I still cannot wol from suspend-to-disk or poweroff with this 
board.  That *sort of* aligns with the MB docs, which say "S5 is only 
supported with WOL cable" and "onboard lan uses PME not WOL" -- except 
(ugh) putting the nic in legacy mode from the boot agent allows wol 
from cold power off, so hmmph.  In any case, what I really wanted was 
wake from ram and I got it so I'm happy.  Possibly S5 is fixed in 
2.6.21 or something -- if I get around to that I'll let you know.

Thanks to all for the help.

Hopefully google will index this, but it would really help to have some 
recent, easy-to-find documentation regarding the steps required for 
"linux wake-on-lan / driver / acpi / ethtool".  The scyld page appears 
to have been down for some time now and most everything else I found 
was at least a couple years old.

Thanks,
Eric

Have you tried BartPE?  There's apyware/plugins listed here:

> What should I buy?

Ghost and a big USB2 hard drive.  Set up a bootable thumbdrive, too.
Generally, bad spyware infestations are best handled by backing up the
user's files, scanning them for macro viruses and doing a full OS
reinstall.  You can speed up reinstalls by putting common drivers and
hotfixes on the USB hard drive.

You never said what your budget was. I've had good luck with Avast's 
BARTPE disk [1]. It's not cheap, but it does work well.

This is impossible.  This is where the meat of all the issues you hear 
about happen.  You're going to get to know Windows better than most 
people if you care about the quality of your work in doing this.  As 
others have mentioned, BartPE with an AV plugin is your best bet for 
offline virus cleaning.  You'll want to spend some time adding in many 
network card drivers though so any system you put the disc in will have 
net access to update the virus def's.

Unfortunately ad|spy|malware mostly needs to be done while the syste, is 
live.  There is a Spybot plugin for Bart, but that class of software can 
be more cancerous to a system than a virus causing damage on multiple 
levels.

It might take you a couple days to learn BartPE and put together a good 
disk that you like, but oh the time it will save in the long run...

> What should I buy?

ERD from Sysinternals (now part of MS).  Their tools are invaluable.

If you're able too, suggest that people use Firefox instead of IE.  I 
keep it and the Flash, shockwave and Java plugins on a thumb drive so 
they have the essential features they expect.  Then I run Spyware 
Blaster on the machine which does some preventative measures in IE and 
FF so malware doesn't get in there to begin with.  I like it because it 
doesn't run in the background and eat resources.  Really, that keeps 
people out of trouble for the most part.

If you're managing a plethora of machines, you may want to think about
disk (re)imaging software such as Deep Freeze.

I know the network admins here at school love it, because it keeps all
of the public and laboratory computers very clean.  Essentially, the
computers reboot each night and the hard drive image is restored back
to the state it was previously.  You can create different images to
suite different needs.

The only drawback here is that the user's data is wiped each day, so
they'd need to have some network and/or removable storage.

New batch of updates/changes every month on 'MS Tuesday', new viruses  
as they hit, so sometimes 'Tuesdays' setup is bad by Wednesday....

I'd go with a baseline monthly install (post tuesday setup), and  
maybe a USB flash drive with a decent anti-virus (and out of process  
MS releases), so you aren't burning new CD's every few days. Such a  
thing would require USB on all your hosts, of course.

Can Knoppix or any of the Linux LiveCDs be used to fix infected Windows
machines?

Apparently, clamAV can scan for viruses on Windows machines:

Not sure if it can fix the problem.

Again, Knoppix is very handy for cloning drives and partitions, even
NTFS filesystems.  Newer versions come with ntfsclone, ntfsresize, and
other ntfs tools, as well as the ntfs-3g drivers for writing to NTFS
filesystems.

I wonder if the follow setup would work to simplify administering
Windows boxes:

- 3 partitions (hda1-Windows system, hda2-Windows data, hda3-linux)
- boot loader is grub, but made to be inconspicuous
- hda3 is large enough to hold a minimal linux install and a pristine
compressed image of hda1
- default operation is to boot into Windows
- alternatively, one can boot into Linux to restore the compressed image
into hda1 or scan for viruses on hda2.

Would that work?

Anyone familiar with:

Devil-Linux

OpenNA Linux

or Gibraltar Firewall?

Back in the Redhat 6.2 days, I used a free pdf book from openna to learn
how to set up a server.

I read a lot about: Ubuntu, Knoppix, Gentoo, and Fedora on here, but not so
much about the above three mentioned distributions on this list.

I'm not so sure that I'm thrilled with the idea of releasing my own Linux
distribution instead of teaching people how to secure one that is more
mainstream.  Evidently, Gibraltar is not free.

I've been using mostly CentOS and Fedora with a smattering of Slackware as
well.  Mondo backup works really well with CentOS 5.  I have not tried
Fedora Core 6 or Fedora 7 as I feel like moving away from Fedora in general.

Hi John,

Thenin lies the rub - you have to download and listen to the podcast, no
video is available. It's in MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats.

Message-ID: <c834ec80705230934k3cad56ahfe16f4b3dcf62db8@mail.gmail.com>

I've been using OpenOffice at work lately, and this morning when I
started it up the toolbars and menu bar are very, very large.

Here's a screenshot:
http://ciscavate.org/data/oo-large.jpg

Abiword is on the top-left, in the background for comparison, OO.org
is in the front.  Notice that the fonts used in OpenOffice for drawing
the Font Selection Dropdown are much larger than those in Abiword.
Yesterday these looked about the same, and "all I've done" is reboot
(I had to duck into windows to use visio).  (I'm assuming I installed
some updates since I restarted X the last time, and that one of those
made OpenOffice look horrid, but I can't imagine what would do that.)

Does anyone have any ideas what could be going on? Is there some java
setting somewhere I need to tweak? This is going to drive me nuts.

I'm running Ubuntu Feisty with xubuntu-desktop (xfce), and everything
is up-to-date with the feisty repositories. (OpenOffice.org 2.2.0)

Thanks!
Rogan

I've used several different distros (Mandrake, SUSE, Red Hat, Gentoo,  
Ubuntu). I've been most pleased with Ubuntu. I also prefer the Gnome

www.avast.com has an excellent bootable bartPE based

far as the cost of the license, but it is an excellent
product.  I use it myself in my consulting service,
and it has worked as well as any other antivirus

dmesg to see the kernel buffer of syslog messages, or for hardware

just wherever syslog is configured to log, iirc.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu verses Fedora: fuse-sshfs and fstab
Message-ID: <46548289.8060306@acm.org>

Provocative, eh?

Well I'm trying to set up some systems to auto-magically do a sshfs mount.

So far I've found two different ways to put the entry in /etc/fstab. 
Problem is only one example for Fedora and many for Ubuntu.

The Fedora example looks correct(er) in that it looks like other fstab 
entries.  The Ubuntu is _different_.

Fedora:

guest at guest.login.com:data /mnt/guest fuse \ 
uid=1003,gid=100,umask=0,allow_other 0 0

Ubuntu:
sshfs#user at server.domain.com:/starting/path fuse user,allow_other 0 0

The sharp '#' is something I've never seen before except as a comment in 
the fstab file.  (Well one time I had to put one in as part of the 
SMB/CIF share name.)  With the Fedora I'm trying to figure out how the 
mounter knows to use sshfs instead of EncFS or one of the many others.

Any ideas or suggestions.  This will be for Fedora Core 5 & 6 systems.


TIA,
Rod

The place where you will have problems is when viruses are found in user 
mailboxes.  You want to remove the specific virus, not the whole mail 
spool.

The only real problem I have had with ClamAV is that the virus definitions 
do not get updated as fast as other anti-virus products.  (I used to 
download viruses from nasty parts of the net and test them against  ClamAV 
and then F-Secure.  Anything ClamAV missed and F-Secure caught got 
submitted to ClamAV.  I need to start doing that again.)

F-Secure has a Linux product but it is a real pain to purchace.

Yeah, that's a critical one. I do like to tinker, and have tinkered with
Linux since 1993. Thanks for reminding me.

Since I asked the original question, I finally found out how to make
KNetworkManager work, and it's as easy as OSX, and so far, just as
reliable. I've also researched the Thinkpad T60 and T61. I think that's
what I'm going to get. Maybe I'll get a used MacBook to play with at
some point.

Thanks to everyone who responded.

Someone that started coming to PTP meetings recently has a Thinkpad
with an Apple logo stuck in the middle of the lid.  It triple boots.
Kinda sexy looking, takes a minute to digest the incongruity of the
big apple logo in the middle and the thinkpad logo in the corner.  I
guess you need to pick the right Thinkpad (video chip, etc) for OSX
to work on it.

Good day all,

Hopefully this won't come through twice...the D-Link went down for 
reasons unknown.

I have been laid up with a badly sprained ankle this last week and have
been trying once again to successfully install Ubuntu Feisty to a
Toshiba Satellite P35-S609 laptop.  The machine is loaded with a P4 3.2,
2g of memory, ATI Mobility Radeon 9000 IGP, and am currently using the
Atheros wireless restricted drivers (HAL).

The problem I am having is the OS will hum along happily for a while and
then will hang.  I still have mouse cursor and movement, but all running
programs seem to halt in mid stride.  There is no real rhyme or reason 
to the amount of time it stays running.  I originally thought it was 
browser related but am no longer thinking that way.  If I try to 
Ctrl-Alt-F1 out of the GUI...it tries and stalls part way out.  I tried 
installing the Kubuntu desktop and it reacts the same.

The install went without a hitch.  The only message I see upon boot up
(with quiet & splash) is about a timer bios something or another.  If
this seems important to you I will read it and relay the exact text to you.

I have resorted to the Win partition of this computer to try your
patience with my questions.  I will be rebooting to try what you
recommend or to fetch more info.

I have had this same experience with Edgy.  Should you be looking for a
different disto?  Which would you recommend?

Thanks in advance,

Bruce

Bruce,
I had similar issues with an Atheros card  in  one of my machines  about a
year ago that  match yours almost to the t, I was using a PCI card though
and not a built in bit. From the research I did it had to do with the Mad
Wifi drivers, are you using those? You may want to try disabling the wifi
and see if the machine then stays stable.

Bruce,
I apologize for not adding context. I meant to say that the Atheros bits
were causing the lockups. I'm not familiar enough with Ubuntu and the
restricted driver set to know what it consists of but I'm going to go find
out :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Debugging CUPS Printing Issue
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0705231409110.3549@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   The last time my LJ5 stopped printing duplex it turned out that the ESW
PrintPro driver was too old. I upgraded to the latest driver version and
that fixed the problem. Now, however, it's the same kernel, Slackware
version, and PrintPro driver version, but the printer will not do duplex
printing, and it adds a blank page after each print job.

   Easy Software has EOL'd the PrintPro drivers. I've looked on the CUP web
site for trouble-shooting for this issue, searched with Google using
different search strings, and I'm out of ideas.

   A couple of months ago, someone from the HP printer team suggested that I
use the hplip drivers because my two printers are a LaserJet 5 (12M RAM,
with duplexer and PostScript modules) and the Professional Series 2500C
inkjet. I downloaded the tarball hplip-1.7.4a.tar.gz, but I cannot find any
instructions on how to set it up, migrate from the PrintPro drivers, or use
it. Does anyone have any experience with hplip to share?

   Your help will be appreciated.

Rich

Uh... And have a cracked copy of OSX?  I thought they had to have the 
equivalent of a hardware dongle (e.g. mac motherboard) to boot it.  In 
fact, I've been told you can't even run OSX on top of OSX.

If not, *please* tell us how to install it on vmware/xen so I can throw 
away this (growl/swear/curse/spit) pile of one-instance-per-powercord

The secret sauce is to delete all entries in /etc/network/interfaces
except the loopback ones. Then add yourself to the 'netdev' group and
log out. Once you do that, KNetMgr will Just Work(tm). 

At least it did for me.

Feel free to email me privately if that doesn't work.

   I found the HPLIP Web site. It looks like the printing functions alone
(HPIJS) work in Slackware; since I don't have fax, postcard, or other
features in my two printers, that's no handicap.

   Now to install it and replace PrintPro ... hope it works correctly the
first time.

The kind folks in #xubuntu on freenode helped me out.  For some reason
I wasn't running the gtk version of OO.org anymore.

A quick 'sudo aptitude install Openoffice.org-gtk' did the trick.

I believe the installer and/or Rosetta (PPC emulation) use the TPM.
Also, I don't think the EULA allows installation on non-Apple
hardware, so while there's a bunch of enthusiast sites describing how
to bypass it, it likely isn't worth it from a legal standpoint.

Hi,
The panel of my Ubuntu 6.06 Gnome desktop panel suddenly changed from 
the top of the desktop to the right side (Vertically). Have no idea what 
I did to cause this but I can't find out how to change it back. Couldn't 
find anything in the 'Official' book or in Keir Thomas's book about this.

In Feisty just clicking on the panel brings up a menu allowing you to 
place the panel on the left/top/right of the desktop but this option 
doesn't appear for Dapper. Anyone know how to get me out of this problem 
? Your help much appreciated.

Is it possible to drag it?  I'm not a gnome user, but (for better or 
worse), the click+drag on the taskbar seems to be fairly universal.

Try this:

Right-clik on the panel,
choose properties
Set the orientation to "top"

Click and drag works under Dapper.

My company is working with a very large customer as they implement our
product.  Our customer used this opportunity to select a Linux OS
distribution.  The leadership wants RH. We recommended debian and the
customer's sysadmins agreed.  Since HP's supporting debian, they decided
on debian.  All that was blown when they talked with the EMC about their
existing SAN.  They only support RH......

So the decision was made to move to RH.  Too bad HP......

If HP wants to grow it's debian linux support business, they have to
start pushing other vendor's as well.  Otherwise they will continue to
miss opportunities like this....

I saw an ad in the latest Linux Journal that Ubuntu LIVE and OSCON in
Portland were ready for registration so I checked it out:

http://www.ubuntu.com/news/spotlight
http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2007/

I'm trying to figure out what to register for. It's very confusing,
plus the dates of Ubuntu LIVE overlap with OSCON. There are only a
couple sessions that interest me so maybe I'll just register for the
free Exhibition Hall for Ubuntu Live. On the other hand, what could be
funner than spending several days geeking out with Linuxoids?

Technically they should be able to support both.  Some places "only 
support Redhat" because it is a known quantity.

It would be interesting to see what code is needed to support the SAN and 
what specific chunks (if any) it needs from Redhat and why.

Thanks for your responses guys. The problem was that I was not getting 
the complete menu when I right-clicked the panel. It suddenly occurred 
to me that I was not seeing 'add to panel' in the menu so I removed 
several items from the panel and then the complete menu, including 
'Properties', popped up OK.

I guess there were too many items in the panel for the shorter vertical 
position. This behavior make no sense to me. I would have expected to 
see 'add to panel' greyed-out but not missing as well as "Properties'. 
Anyway, all is well and,yes, Dapper works the same as Feisty .... now <g>.

You were probably seeing the menu for the items on the panel, rather
than the menu for the actual panel.  I think there is a way to get to
the panel properties through one of the Gnome Settings menus, but I
may be wrong. (xfce and kde both make this simpler, fwiw.)

You can also right-click on one of the panel "handles" on the end, or
there is often a 1-px wide strip between buttons on the panel that
will display the actual "panel" menu.  Or it could be a bug in Gnome
(heck, it could be a "feature", for all I know.)

Regardless, keep in mind that there are many, many alternatives to
Gnome, if/when you become frustrated with it -- don't blame the OS for
problems with the desktop manager :)

Pretty typical.  Vendors want to use the same processes for Linux as for
other OSes.  RH has done a good job of convincing vendors that their
Linux distro is just as monolithic and slow-moving as proprietary OSes.
So vendors can release drivers and SW hand-built for particular RH
versions, write phone-scripts for their tier-1 support drones, and tick
the "Linux Support" checkbox.

My experience is that if (a) a product is a must-have and (b) the vendor
says they support RH, that's what you're gonna be running everywhere.
I've had good experiences getting vendors to help me use their product
on other distros, but people with the power to make decisions about how
to spend money are usually risk-averse.  They also rarely have
experience with what passes for "Linux support", and how useless it
usually is.

And don't get me started on Windows support,
  Aaron

Absolutely right, I would have to believe that the SAN interface driver
is available under Linux (not just RH).  I haven't verified this
however.  I think EMC's view is that with RH they have someone to call
if it doesn't work.  I don't think HP has any partner agreements
supporting Debian, which in my opinion this hurting them.  They probably
maintain the view that they are a full service hardware provider so why
should they look at working with other hardware vendors.

I don't know.  I haven't looked at the SAN offerings lately, I just
received a call telling me that debian was out because EMC refused to
support anything linux other than RH.

The reason I ask is that's a binary-only kernel module for multipath I/O.

PowerPath 4.5.1 for Linux supports:
? RHEL 4.0 Update 3.
? SLES 9 SP3.

So yeah, binary kernel modules == bad.

Mondo backup has an easier time with Redhat based distros than
debian and gentoo.  Linux support should mean, works with Linux.
To accomplish that though, you almost need a completely
open spec product.  Why won't big companies maintain
drivers for 2-3 major Linux distributions?  Support Debian,
Redhat (and derivatives), Gentoo, and Ubuntu and you've
covered almost everyone.  Because of Linux Standards Base,
there should only be a few problem areas.

What is wrong with a license that says, "Here is the hardware 
spec free of charge as long as you don't use it to produce 
our product without either a: fairly compensating us or b: 
getting a license from us to produce it?  Obviously, any
part of our designs that are in the public domain can be
produced by you without a license from us to do so.  You
may write software to work with our design under any license
so long as noone else's use of it is negatively impacted."  
If companies would do the above or something close enough,
Linux support, I believe, would get much better.

I'm not a lawyer, so clearly someone can blow holes through
this.  Maybe it's a place to start though ;-)

I haven't wrangled with FC since '03.  Looks like multipathing has been
in the kernel since 2.6.5, and a quick Google survey indicates that
native multipathing works much better than PowerPath.  

> So yeah, binary kernel modules == bad.

Stupid, too.  But it fits the model already established by the
proprietary OSes.  And who wants to learn a new support/development
model just to support one more measly OS?

No argument on either point. Just means that the stupidity lies in the
vendor of the binary module, and not the vendor of the distribution
targeted.

Oops.  That's 2.6.12.  And it's been backported to some RHEL4 kernels.

Ayuh.  No slight intended toward Red Hat and I don't begrudge them their
revenues, I just wish they weren't so successful at acting like a
proprietary software company.

Is this a two-machine or four-machine one? I have the cheap two-machine 
one and all I know is two scroll-locks in rapid succession followed by 
an up-arrow or a down-arrow. By the way, for some reason, that also 
disables the scroll wheel on the mouse and takes a reboot to get it 
back. I never have figured out how to fix that -- if someone knows, 
please share. ;)

I had the same problem after disconnecting one of my machines to do
maintenance, to resolve the issue I disconnected everything from the switch
and let it power down then reconnected everything and it seems to be fine
now.

Is this a two-machine or four-machine one? I have the cheap two-machine 
one and all I know is two scroll-locks in rapid succession followed by 
an up-arrow or a down-arrow. By the way, for some reason, that also 
disables the scroll wheel on the mouse and takes a reboot to get it 
back. I never have figured out how to fix that -- if someone knows,

Message-ID: <46566CDF.1000403@comcast.net>

What tool can I use to watch traffic on my LAN between my XP laptop and
my Brother MFC7820N printer? I'm trying to figure out if there is
something being sent to the printer that is giving it grief.

When I send a large document (8 pages of text, with three images per
page), the printer comes out of sleep mode, says "Please Wait" on the
LCD, then says "Receiving Data" on the LCD, the motors start, the motors
stop suddenly, the LCD goes blank/dark, and then repeats the cycle three
or four times before starting to print a page, and then jams.

I'm printing from a real estate application that only works with IE (so
I'm stuck with MS until they finish revising their site to work with
Firefox -- maybe by January). I can export the data to a pdf, but both
the Windows and Linux versions of Adobe reader produce the same results
-- the cycle described, above.

The fellow at Office Depot was willing to swap my old (March of this
year) MFC7820 for a new one. I set it up a few minutes ago, and once I
had entered the static IP address on the printer, it started printing
something that I had tried to print from my Linux machine earlier this
afternoon. (This relates to the question I asked about how to get past
the "client-error-forbidden" error message in my CUPS post of this
afternoon.)

What is odd is that it appears that the first job into the printer works
OK. Also, if what I print is only one page, or if there is very little
on a few pages, it works OK (I tried printing four pages with "page
one", "page two", etc. -- that worked).

I don't have a scroll wheel.  But I lose the drag lock button on my trackball
whenever I switch.  I've found that I can get it back by unplugging
the trackball
from the switch, and then plugging it back in again.

This isn't as annoying as a reboot, but it's still damned annoying.
I now get around the problem entirely by staying on one box and
using rdesktop to access the second.

If this is like my Omniview Pro, then you need to do 01, and 02, not 1 
and 2.  The first digit is for the bank, the second for the channel. 
These KVM's can be cascaded, so it's a two digit entry.

Thanks for the reply.  If I can get this machine to stay up in (K)Ubuntu 
long enough, I will give this a try.

With the 4-up, you can use the 1234 keys.  I haven't tried the arrows.

IIRC, you

  sudo perl -e 'print chr(255)' > /dev/mouse

Or thereabouts to reset it.  I had an suid compiled C program that did 
roughly that, but now I don't know where the source went.  It might 
take more than one byte -- I seem to remember it quit working at one 
kernel version but I've long since lost my patience with belkin and 
quit using it.

Google seems to think you should read the 3-button mouse howto or 
something.

Thanks.

Last night I looked through the network tools available through YaST on
my SuSE 10.1 machine and found Ethereal. I installed it, but haven't
started reading the manual, yet.

I started this morning with the good old fashioned technique of
disconnecting all the cables, and then putting them back one at a time
until the problem showed up again.

First, I tried a crossover cable between my laptop (WinXP) and the
printer (Brother MFC7820N). Didn't work.

Then I tried just the laptop, the router (disconnected from the cable
modem), and the printer. That works.

When I added the link to the basement, the problem returned. In the
basement I have a switch connected to a Thinkpad 390 (Win98SE) and my
newly installed Slackware 11 machine. I disconnected the Slackware
machine and tried again. The problem went away. At least the problem
changed. I need to try again with only the printer, router, and laptop
and watch the LCD on the printer to be sure. But, at least printing
works again with the Slackware machine out of the picture. Getting real
work done has the priority at the moment, so I'll put off watching the
traffic with Ethereal, or maybe wireshark, until tomorrow.

Thanks everyone for all the input


I have the  omniview  F1DE108C

The thing that really helped..

<scroll-lock><scroll-lock> space bar


Brings up the GUI menu....

Can change it or gives a visual reference who everyone is that is
connected..

Thanks Again

This would only work if you had compatible static IP addresses
configured on both the printer and the laptop.  If either is using
DHCP it would not work.

If your setup is the standard setup, then the router is your DHCP
server, so is required.

Check the network configuration on the Slackware machine and see if
you have an address conflict with one of your other devices.  You
shouldn't need Wireshark/Ethereal to do that.

Perhaps this is obvious to you, but if you are trying to sniff network 
traffic between your XP laptop and the printer using a third machine,
you will need to use a hub rather than a switch.  Some switches have a 
port mirroring feature to deal with this, but mirroring isn't 
typically available on consumer level switches.

One other possibility that just occurred to me would be for the third
machine to have two ethernet ports bridged together.  Insert the
machine in the path between the end-points somewhere,

  brctl addbr br0
  brctl addif br0 eth0
  brctl addif br0 eth1
  dhclient br0

or something, and then run wireshark/ethereal on br0.

I think someone's been hacking too many wireless access points.

No kidding.  Bridging would work, but I think it would be easier to
just run wireshark/ethereal on the XP machine.

That explains it. The printer has a static IP address, but the laptop
gets one from the router.

The Slackware machine is 192.168.0.254; the printer is 192.168.0.252. I
just shut down the Slackware machine, so I'll confirm that tomorrow, or
whenever I get time to play with it some more. I know that I used putty
from the laptop to connect to the Slack ware machine by IP address this
morning, so I'm pretty sure that's correct. I don't know if there are
any other IP addresses lurking about on that machine. I wouldn't think
there would be, but I'll check it out later.

Thanks for your help.

Not obvious, but I did wonder about it.

It looks like the culprit is another machine, and it is on a switch.
I'll probably have to bring it upstairs to play with it some more.

Thanks for the pointer.

Thanks.

I actually thought of that, sort of. I hadn't gotten as far as figuring
out how to do it, but it occurred to me that it might be necessary.
Reminds me of the Clifford Stoll book, The Cuckoos Egg, where he applied
that concept with serial ports to catch the hacker from Germany trying
to use the UC Berkeley computers.

Subject: [PLUG] Home Network Hardware Choices
Message-ID: <465758A7.1000801@comcast.net>

I currently have a mix of 10 and 10/100 routers, switches, and hubs.
(Actually, 1 of each, and it's only the hub that is limited to 10 Mb).

I'm considering the best solution for replacing the hub. Simplest would
be a 10/100 hub, but it looks like hubs are too old school anymore.

The next simplest solution is to just get another 10/100 switch to
replace the hub. The question then, is what brands to avoid. The C-net
switch has never given me any trouble, at least none that I know of. The
Netgear Router has also been reliable. ENU has a no-brand 8-port 10/100
switch for $22, and a Trendnet 8-port 10/100 switch for $24. After that,
the speeds go up to 10/100/1000, and the price doubles.

Does anyone have experience with the no-brand from ENU, or the Trendnet?

The topology (50 cent word -- I hope I'm using it correctly!) is:

Cable Modem -> Netgear Router - both on the second floor

Netgear Router (10/100)
	-> 8 port C-net Switch
	-> Hub
	-> Brother MFC7820N Printer
	-> Wife's XP machine

C-net Switch (10/100) - in the basement
	-> n/c
	-> Slackware machine
	-> Thinkpad 390 (Win98)
	-> spare
	-> n/c
	-> n/c
	-> n/c
	-> Up link -> Netgear Router

Hub (10) - sitting on top of the router
	-> n/c
	-> eTower 466 (Win98)
	-> n/c
	-> Home made Athlon 2100 machine (SuSE 10.1)
	-> Thinkpad 600e
	-> spare
	-> Acer Aspire Laptop (Win XP)
	-> (Unavailable)
	-> Up link -> Netgear Router

(The difference between n/c and spare, above, is that n/c really has no
connection while spare has a cable connected at the switch or hub, but
nothing on the other end.)

Thanks for any advice.

Just wanted to share an alternative I hadn't seen mentioned before.
The bonus is not having to touch the windows machine.

And, btw, USB ethernet devices would make this pretty easy.

True.  I think I have to work on my email style, since I clearly sound
like an ass when I'm really just trying to be concise :-/

I actually think there's been some work on a non-installed version of
Wireshark, in particular for the U3 USB device (which I know nothing
about, http://www.u3.com/), but I think the limitation is winpcap's
need to install itself, a limitation that Linux obviously doesn't
have.

Personally, I've had excellent luck with the Netgear ProSafe FS105,
FS108 and FS116.  Solidly built in a steel enclosure, nice blinky
lights.  I got an FS116 (16-port) at OfficeDespot for around $60
recently.  These switches are 10/100 but have 1G versions now too.

I was very, very happy with my Linksys EtherFast 4116  (made by cisco, iirc)

http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115416900037&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper

I used it for about a year, and it's been sitting in an anti-static
bag since.  I've since moved all my servers to a colo and have no use
for it any more, as all my home networking is wifi these days.  It's
fairly compact, but does have brackets to make it fit into a 19" 1U
rack slot.

If anyone is interested in a switch that works great (and wouldn't
cost much, say $30-35?), let me know :) (I'm in Seattle unfortunately,
so I'd have to ship it or bring it down next time I visit family in
stump town)

More people should pick such nits.  It slows me down when I have to reread stuff

That's a very nice job listing, but what if you have only an 
associates degree and no Linux administration experience to 
put on a resume?  Asking for experience all the time is a
problem for people who don't have a start.

Not an answer to your question (though I suspect it's no, since if there
were such things someone here would know about them), but I was reading
this the other day:

http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2007/05/21/a-day-without-x/

and it got me thinking I really should try doing without X for a bit,
just for the sake of learning how to use some of these apps.
Personally, I tend to think I won't do it unless I "have to" -- that is,
it's too easy to fall back on comfy, familiar GUI apps when I'm in X.  I
suppose it might be enough to use a terminal-oriented WM like dwm, wmii,
or twin for a while.

There are lots of such articles and discussions out there -- best cli
apps and so forth.  Some I use in a fairly rudimentary way (vim,
midnight commander), some I've used in the past and still use on
occasion (cplay, links), some I've found difficult to get with (slrn),
and some have always seemed too daunting (mutt, emacs).  And there are
numerous others I've long meant to check out, just for the sake of it.

A "Do Linux Without X (Because You Can!)" workshop series would be
interesting.

   There ain't no free lunch. Even in the article it says that the hosting
companies collect resumes, interviews, and 'feedback' (is this the return of
the lunch?) as payment.

Message-ID: <1180254842.20285.0.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have been accused of encouraging cyber crime against a
particular individual by what I've posted here on the
plug list.

I've gone by someone plug_0 at robinson-west.com in the past.

One posting that upsets this person asked the question,
"Is there a weakness in the iBook that allows someone to
hack DNS packets easily?"  I asked this to find a way to
plug a possible hole, not to encourage another attack
of his/her laptop.

Another post has come back to me with an accusation that I
ticked off Opus interactive asking if there could be a
renegade dns server inside their network.  An argument has
been pressed that Opus requested a recent subnet change for
the service I go through as a result of my postings here.

Considering that Opus's policy for abuse is termination of
Internet service, I seriously doubt that the subnet change
had anything to do with upsetting my ISP.  I was told
there is a new organizational system and a need to reduce
the spread of static subnet assignments across their IP
space.  I accept this explanation for Opus making the
change it did and I believe it to be the whole truth.

Is there any chance of having email postings of mine that
are likely to feed future paranoid accusations expunged from
the plug archives?  I really care about this person where
removal is probably the easiest way to address the recent
difficulty between us.  A 100+ meg file is an awful lot to
review...  If only I were a perl expert...

I don't know of a single post to this list that could be
legitimately labeled the XYZ instructions to cyber attack
someone.

For those who read this, please refrain from gossiping about
who my critic is.  That will only make matters worse most
likely.  I ask if you feel you know who it is that you
keep the peron's name to yourself and not share it ;-)

Free exchange of information will sometimes lead to misunderstandings.
It is the misunderstandings that need to be eradicated, not the free
exchange of information.  Being easily offended does not help the
cause of Freedom.  For example, I work in a building with 200 other
people.  One of them happens to be a compulsive cryer.  Does it mean
I'm doing something something wrong if I say "Hi there" and she starts
crying?  No one in my building thinks so.  Just my two cents.

This has merit.  

Despite sounding borderline paranoid myself, what of the argument 
people becoming Linux professionals in the future don't want to 
lose business to someone who dislikes what they've posted here?

The Internet is like an odd recorder that doesn't always present
people positively let alone accurately.  In the radio era, I'm 
sure people would forget what thing someone said on it that 
upset them after a fairly short time.  In this age of digital 
backups and data shelf life of 30+ years, the reality is very different.
The problem doesn't lie with the technology, it's a 
purely sociological one.  What is acceptable today, may, because
of the nature of the Net, look terrible to society 30 years from
now and cost you a job.

How many people recorded radio programs in the 30's?

It's easy to argue that I am proposing far too direct a correlation
between making posts to an Internet email list today and being in
political hot water for it down the road.

Calling recorded (amended?) Net activity speech has some potentially 
nasty implications down the road.  Is it speech anymore if you 
won't say it in a changed political climate with possibly different
opinions about the world?  Maybe you get older and wiser?

No.

Not even if you posted the (I forget what online service that was - 
AOL?) password file.

If you're posting information that should have been secret, you are 
certainly at fault for breaking trust.  If you're reposting common 
knowledge, the cat is already out of the bag and archive scrubbing 
isn't going to do any good.

If you're just saying not-nice things, well... you know the list is 
archived so act accordingly.

What are some decent distros with active security updating that

What works with 128M?
What works with  64M?

I hope the built-in wireless NIC works with Ubuntu on the laptop. I  
have a 1 year old Gateway laptop that runs on Ubuntu, and I have not  
been able to get the built-in wireless NIC to work.

I'm guessing this all assumes an untuned kernel or something.  I would 
actually be surprised if etch wouldn't run on 32MB.  Maybe the 
installer assumes 48MB?

Looks like the only wireless option is an Intel 3945a/g, which has
Linux support.

What type of wireless is in your Gateway?  Perhaps if you post some
info people around here could help you get it working.

I managed to get Woody to run including KDE 2 in a 32 MB Toshiba 
Libretto 70 (133 MHz Pentium MMX, IIRC) with a 1.5 GB hard drive. I'm 
guessing it would run better with Windowmaker. You have to do some 
hacking to get things into it, however -- it won't boot a Debian floppy, 
so I put DOS 5.0 on the first 25 meg of the hard drive and bootstrapped 
install media in that way. I might go back to it when I get some free 
time if I can pick up a new battery for it -- it's a nice little machine.

Keep in mind that sometimes the install requirements may be bigger than 
the actual runtime...  Like all the RedHat based distros using 
Anaconda.  Beep-Beep-Beep.  Thats the sound of all the Python libraries 
being loaded from a dump truck.

If you want to see whats possible, look at OpenWrt (Linux), which runs 
in 4 MB of RAM and 32Mb of flash!   Likewise PFsense/Monowall 
(FreeBSD).   These all are very nice integrated distros, and focused on 
a relatively narrow scope (routing).

Why is the list being archived indefinitely anyways?  

Surely, I'm not the only one concerned about this who has
posted here before.  There's the idea of having useful 
information archived to avoid answering the same questions 
over and over and over again, but doesn't there come a time 
when the archive should be vetted?

If there's an off topic flame thread on this list, is that 
retained for the archive?

I'm surprised that noone else has raised concerns about the 
archiving policies of this list, or do most readers simply 
refrain from posting any questions here at all avoiding the
whole entire problem altogether?

Someone must be harvesting my email addresses.  Even after
changing them, I am getting heavily spammed again.  If an 
email address is in the archive, it is available for the 
taking.  What are you supposed to do, post to the list 
using an address you won't accept replies back to from the
Net?  Talk about hard to do.  I notice that some messages 
from the plug list don't have a source address of
plug at lists.pdxlinux.org.  If there are as many valid source
addresses for plug list as there are subscribers, it would 
be a mess to list them all and keep that list both current
and as small as possible.

Can a Postfix smtp server do limited sender checking for 
specific recipient addresses without limiting all recipient 
addresses that it relays for equally?  

A valid recipient target could be sender restricted via 
white listing.  Maybe I can have a sender testing free 
recipient target drop email that has attachments or 
indecipherable text.  Another thing I want to try is 
gray listing any incoming email where the source address 
is in a dynamically assigned address pool.

I wish there was a DNS RBL or a DNS RHSBL that I can check 
to see if a sender address is in fact from the plug list.
Such a list should have all the current subscribers to
the list (just the ones that are posting to the list).

The Debian installers are much lighter ... if you can boot a CD and sync 
with the Internet, you can probably get Debian on it easily. Now that I 
think of it, the Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS boot CD can install over the 
network too, but I don't know how much RAM it needs.

Because many, many questions come up more than once, and often the
answers are of use to people who are googling, but aren't on the list.
(or heck, people who are on the list.)

In my opinion, no.  It's probably in the google cache and the way-back
machine (amongst other caches) anyway.  Once something gets on the
'net there is effectively no way to get rid of it.  I don't foresee
that changing any time soon, so in the meantime, we just have to be
civil about it, and apologize when we make mistakes.

Yep.  It's not like a history text ;)

I think most people just realize that anything you say can come back
to haunt you, so we try not to make asses of ourselves, and if/when we
do, then we're prepared to deal with the consequences.

Regarding spam issues -- I've been using the same email address for
the last 4-5 years and gmail's filters are still doing a very, very
good job of keeping my inbox clear and my spam folder dirty.  As with
the issues regarding internet archiving, spam is something we can't
seem to avoid, so until things change it seems we must live with it.
Thankfully, technology is pretty capable at preventing it from being
to much of a hindrance for many of us.

I was curious about that too, so I checked the rest of the details. As
far as I can tell, it comes with a PCMCIA wireless card as standard
equipment. It doesn't specifically say why, but my guess is that, if it
has a built in wireless chip, it won't work out of the box with Ubuntu.
I didn't check further, as I'm not in the market for a new laptop at
the moment. But if I were, I'd insist on "the rest of the story" before
placing the order. 

Another issue that has been brought up occasionally on the Ubuntu
forums is whether it ships with 64-bit or 32-bit Ubuntu. That' another
question I would ask before getting out the plastic.

Please do not take my comments as negative toward Dell. I think what
they've done is awesome. Even if it is not a perfect first step, it's
still something no other major computer manufacturer has done and Dell
deserves a major pat on the back. More importantly, I hope the sales
figures will give Dell the bottom line support that will entice them to
expand the offerings.

Does having your laptops on the Red Hat Hardware Compatibility List as 
certified count as nothing? IIRC "major computer manufacturers" have 
been doing that with laptops, desktops and servers for years -- even 
before the great Fedora spin-off. And I think you could buy Thinkpads 
with Linux loaded on them for some time, though possibly it was a third 
party and not IBM selling them. I don't think the Dell/Ubuntu counts as 
much of a "first step" or deserving of a "major" pat on the back. It was 
a business decision, and only time will tell whether it was a wise one 
or not.

I don't think that's why Dell did the deal with Ubuntu. I think they did 
it to challenge Red Hat, and *that* I think *does* deserve a pat on the 
back, not "just selling computers with Linux on them at the retail 
level". Please do not take my comments as negative towards Red Hat. ;-)

Subject: [PLUG] Comcast lease problem
Message-ID: <20070528123606.GA23438@bejay.com>

I was wondering if anyone else was having this problem. Recently, my ip lease 
with Comcast is only for an hour, instead of several days, and it won't 
auto-renew itself. I called tech support, which was useless. Also, the 
gateway address I keep getting changes, from 71.193.182.1 to 71.236.172.1 to 
67.160.144.1 to 67.189.90.1.

Nothing in my setup is changed. I have a 3com hub. Everything works fine for 
as long as the lease runs.

Part of knowing that lists (the vast majority of, not just this one) are
archived indefinitely is coming to a degree of tolerance.  Everyone has 
embarrassing bits archived out there someplace. It does promote an
acknowledgement that no one is perfect all the time.

What problem would that be?  That in the future someone will find out I didn't
consult the man page and asked a brain dead syntax question?  That my
knowledge is limited and I know there's lots of someones who know what I need
to know and will share?

Changing email addresses is an ineffective spam stratagey that annoys people
who try to stay in touch with you. spammers spam non-existant email addresses!

Finding an email provider, such as Google, or getting adept at implementing
traps and filters is a necessity in today's world. 

My system receives about 500 spam an hour (measured since February 10 of this
year) and on average one or two of those make it to my inbox.  Spamassassin 
is the primary tool in that filtering.

My first reaction is that Comcast is doing this on purpose to stop
people from running servers and maybe to mess with torrent as well.
That may be giving Comcast too much credit.

I don't get anywhere near 500 messages per hour, much less 500 
spam messages per hour, but my system ends up accepting for delivery 
only 45% - 50% of the messages sent to it. Here are the stats for the 
last couple weeks:

Totals:
  10501 -- Messages processed
   3634 -- Messages blocked by rule (34.6%)
   1826 -- Messages rejected during scanning (17.4%)
   5041 -- Messages accepted for delivery (48.0%)

Details...

Messages Blocked By Rule:
   3409 -- Known spam IP address (sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org)
    163 -- Invalid recipient or relay
     62 -- Invalid sender domain

Messages Rejected During Scanning (milter-based):
   1793 -- SpamAssassin
     33 -- ClamAV

A hobbyist mail admin can do whatever s/he likes, but IMO any 
professional admin who doesn't scan inbound mail for nastiness is 
pushing the boundary of incompetence.

While my Comcast has been static for the better part of a year now, 
I'll note that I saw some oddities in my Apache logs last night. Take 
a peek at these three entries:

c-24-20-160-119.hsd1.mn.comcast.net - - [27/May/2007:20:07:02 ....]
c-24-20-160-119.hsd1.or.comcast.net - - [27/May/2007:20:07:43 ....]
c-24-20-160-119.hsd1.mn.comcast.net - - [27/May/2007:20:08:52 ....]

See the DNS flip-flop between 'mn' and 'or' in the hostname? Same IP 
address, different names. It's almost like someone at Comcast is using 
the holiday weekend to move a block of IP addresses between Minnesota 
and Oregon -- or maybe someone made a mistake. Perhaps the address 
block you've been assigned is part of the migration/mistake.

Thanks for that info.  It seems reasonable to assume that such an event
would be either a maintenance glitch or a one-time response to some
abnormal routing event.  To think that Comcast, whatever else may be
their many sins, would actively attempt to thwart subscriber efforts to
run torrents is profoundly disturbing, on so many levels.

I just can't conceive of any circumstance where Comcast would become an enforcement agency for the MPAA/RIAA.  But I'm just not savvy
enough to make any kind of informed statement on the topic.

My own personal experience with their technical/support staff is such
that I am inclined to such occurrences to happenstance rather than
intention.  After all, these are guys who told me that I had "contact
Linux" in order to get my modem hooked up.

Everybody is at home for the three day weekend, with you, surfing. 
All the college students are home, trading songs while mom does
their laundry.  Lots of data moving.  I imagine that is causing
Comcast to do all sorts of rearrangements to adapt.

The Comcast dynamic IP is just that.  I once hired a sysadmin to
help set up my firewall, and he hardwired the dynamic IP address in
a bunch of places (DNS, iptables, etc) because "it never changes".
That plagued me for years, until I learned enough to set up the
network addresses correctly.

You can get your DNS at a place like dyndns.org, and run software
that detects IP address changes and resets the dyndns.org URL to
IP mapping in a minute or so.  Moving IP addresses will still
confuse torrents, though, and a lot of mail servers out there won't
talk to a dynamic IP address - too many spammers use them.

If you want a fixed IP address and a server, either pay Comcast for
the privilege, or run a VPN tunnel to an offsite machine with a
fixed IP address.  I do the latter, and I no longer care what IP
address Comcast assigns to me (as long as it does not match the 
IP address range of my internal 192.168... network).

Keith

PS:  the second sysadmin I hired knew better than to rely on a 
dynamic IP, so there are good ones and bad ones.  When you are 
smart enough to tell the difference, you are probably smart
enough to do it yourself, sigh.

Thanks for that!  I think I'm finally beginning to understand the basic
contrast between static and dynamic ip addresses.  It's useful
information.

I have a Dell Latitude D610 running Ubuntu Dapper.  Built-in wireless
works just fine.  In fact, I'm using it right now to send this e-mail.
So, Dell could build laptops with built-in wireless.  Whether they do
nor not is to be seen.

  I didn't care for DSL.  I found it too specialized for general use.
It appeared to be a toy for it's developers usage.  Porting new apps
to the distro was a real PITA.  Other than that... it seemed to work
well on small memory platforms.  The wireless support for 802.11
PCMCIA cards worked well.

  My plan was to gift an old Dell Inspiron 3500 (233Mhz Pentium, 96M
Mem) to a girlfriend.  She wanted a laptop to take out with her
telescope.  The planetarium programs on Linux are great tools to help
a new hobbyist with their viewing.  I also wanted to get a PCMCIA
802.11 card working so she could check her email using open access
points.

  I tried installing a number of the "small" distros on the Dell over
the winter.  A lot of them did poor hardware detection and wouldn't
install correctly.  A lot of them didn't include the wireless support
and tools I was looking for.  I was unimpressed.

  I tried installing the "lite" option for a couple of full size
distros.  It didn't work very well.  The machine would boot and run,
but would screw themselves into the ground from race conditions in the
GUI.  Gnome and KDE run very poorly in a cycle-starved condition.

I finally ended up installing the Xfce version of Ubuntu, Xubuntu.
http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/xubuntu

  It's still a bit heavy-weight for a little machine like a Dell 3500,
but it runs OK.  The good software support makes up for the poor
performance.

  The only problem I've had to fix so far is to disable
smooth-scrolling in AlbiWord.  The smooth-scrolling option kills the
application response time on cycle-starved system.  I never did get
the sound to work.  Support for the Dell's old sound chip has
apparently fallen out of the code.

Just out of curiosity, is that XFCE 4.2 or 4.4? 4.4 is a good bit heavier than
4.2. In fact, I think you can strip Gnome down to the point where it's lighter
than the "default" XFCE 4.4 -- drop out the Evolution, Thunderbird and Firefox
stuff and just put Seamonkey in or even use Epiphany only and you get just
about everything.

It's becoming a little known secret that the desktop manager / window
manager has absolutely nothing to do with the distribution,
particularly with "lite" installs.  It's  really not difficult to
install a lighter window manager.  They work quite well, too.
(blackbox, openbox, afterstep, window maker, and yes, even
Enlightenment, all run much faster than gnome / kde these days.)

Make sure everything in the "services" list is disabled, and/or run
through /etc/rcS.d and rcN.d (where N is your default runlevel,
probably 2,3 or 5) and disable everything you aren't using.

Xubuntu-desktop runs something called "gam_server" that (I think?) has
to do with disk monitoring for some indexed search tool.  Occasionally
it will suck up a good 80-90% of my cpu, and it's always sitting there
at 6-10%.  If you find a way to turn that off, I'd suggest doing so.
(and please tell me if you do ;).

"fasterfox" is probably worth looking into too -- it's an optimized
build of firefox for Linux.  I'm going to give it a shot at some
point, and I'll report back.

My Gateway laptop ships with 64-bit. It runs Ubuntu Edgy (I think  
this is the current version just fine); however, I had to install the  
i386 version of Ubuntu last year because of recommendations to not  
use the 64-bit version of Ubuntu at that time. I've been using an  
older Linksys wireless card (about 5 years old) on my laptop and that  
works fine. Yes, the laptop uses a PCMCIA wireless card that is built  
into the board. I think my experience is just another example of the  
lack of hardware drivers for the numerous Linux distros.

I see no reason why a system allowing you to indicate, 
"I don't want post X which I submitted to this list archived,"
can't be discussed here.  

A python/perl/php based engine could show you all of your old 
posts and allow you to set an archive preference.  From that, 
a search for other posts quoting one you don't want archived 
can be done so that those posts will get cut as well.  There 
is already censorship from people other than the original 
authors going on if less than everything goes into the archive
in the first place.  IMHO letting the authors of the posts 
submitted for this list censor their own submissions when it 
comes to the archive makes more sense.  No, this does not 
address what is in off list archives.  Thing is, let me be 
clear that I am not proposing anything to address that issue.

Accomodating someone's wishes is sometimes seen as a sign of 
respect.  The more comfortable people are communicating over
the Net, the more effectively they will use it.  In this age
of rampant identity theft and growing concerns about the Net 
becoming a toxic treatise on everyone who uses it, I see that
the matter of what should be archived and made accessible is 
a growing one.

Civil liberties fanatics scream about having photos of people
taken at the Super Bowl to filter out terrorists, but I guess
if someone doesn't want to be archived here that this isn't
considered a valid privacy concern.

I use it too Rogan, but it misses a lot of emails that 
it would be a real challenge to tune it for.  There are
spammers out there that actually use decipherable text
and forego strange formatting.  Spamassassin follows 
the idea of detecting formatting errors and irregularities
and it uses a realtime blackhole list or two, correct?  At
the end of the day, spammers don't have to disseminate 
irregular email getting them past spamassassin untagged.

If it were feasible to go after spam sources and remove the 
economic incentive to put out unsolicited mass email, spam 
would diminish almost entirely.

This discussion aside, I don't know what your problem is 
Rogan that you feel a need to denigrate me and claim 
that you are ready to rant and rave.

You are right and wrong. Linux 32 bit drivers are not as compatible as Windows 32 bit drivers because there are more of them. However when you can't install Windows VISTA 64 bit on your laptop because if you did the drivers probably would not be available and you would not even be able to connect to the internet or play sounds. You may not even get your video to work resulting in a Blue Screen. Now those 32 bit drivers for Linux we were talking about well they work just fine for Linux 64 bit. Why? Because they are open source and can just be recompiled. 64 bit runs way faster on a 64 or 128 bit computer. Now Microsoft and computer manufacturers know this and so they only install Vista 32 bit on their new computers. Sure they should run faster but because they only have Windows 32 bit on them they run as slow as the computers 3 years ago. Most people don't understand this. You on the other hand have used both Ubuntu 64 bit and 32 bit so you know full well what runs faster.
 On a laptop this can be interesting anyway because most laptop hard drives are slow.

Subject: [PLUG] Feisty freeze-ups solved
Message-ID: <465B64CF.7030409@verizon.net>

I recently posted about Feisty-freezeups on my Toshiba laptop.  Drew 
thought the problem sounded very like one he had with the Wifi drivers 
for an Atheros card he had.

The problem turned out to be one related to the boot up error I was 
getting and couldn't remember when I posted to the list.  The error was 
*"MP*-*BIOS bug*: *8254* timer not connected to IO-APIC".

Adding noapic to the boot options took care of the problem.  I should 
have noted the obvious error before I jumped to conclusions.

Thanks for the help.

I'm fairly certain there was a degree of sarcasm to Michael
Rasmussen's comments above.     How his comment could relate to
discrimination is a bit of a mystery to me though.

Unfortunately, my name ended up at the top of Michael Rasmussen's
message, which is what you were replying to. (Nothing I wrote was
actually in that message. Oh well, it happens, and the fact that it's
archived in public doesn't really bother me that much.)

This does demonstrate one of the reason's I'm not that worried about
an email archive.  Things get messed up *all the time*, and we end up
mis-attributed frequently.  Email is just like that.  If anyone ever
tries to sue me for something Michael Rasmussen said above, then we
can dig around and find all my original messages on this thread, and
prove that no, I didn't say these things (as a side note, I do agree
with most of his points, I'm just using this as an example.).  That's
the other side of the coin -- if everything is archived you can almost
always find out the truth, and that is something I feel very strongly
about.

It is nice to cut people a bit of slack on-line though, and read
things very carefully, lest you (and by "you" I mean anyone) say
something that you will come to regret.

Dear "SOMEONE,"

Because you'd be chopping up discussions. Much in the way that
top-posting is annoying, imagine not being able to find the context at all!

The good news is that you _can_ choose to stay out of the PLUG archives
all together.

<rant off-topic-for-PLUG> This is just as bad as people talking about
how "offended" they are. In America, nobody has the right to never be
offended. Freedom of speech implies freedom to offend. It may be a weak
correlation, but I view your request to edit the archives akin to a
right-wing Christian attempt at controlling information. (Note: I hate
liberals too -- protesters that don't know what they're protesting --
sheesh!)
You posted it; it's public. Live and learn.
</rant>

I'm further mystified as to why you'd want to remove postings that were
innocent in nature. Just explain the misunderstanding, and be done with it.

And FYI identity theft still happens offline 90% of the time (rough
estimate based on recollections of recent studies).

And on the subject of spam, as another data point, I've received 50
e-mails today, and: "9588 rejected (99%)"

You signed your name to something and posted a message to a public 
forum.  You lost any anonymity when you did that.  You went from 
"someone" to "Michael C. Robinson" by your own doing.  I think you give 
yourself too much credit in being person if interest with something like 
this.  There also appears to be some very basic concepts of internet 
privacy you're missing.  *sigh* I am sounding mean and nasty now...

Except yours is linked with a domain name, and unless you lied in your 
whois info I could have your address now as well.  With Argali I can 
have the names of all your neighbors and with google I would get 
satellite imagery of your neighborhood and house.  Your name is only one 
piece of information in a pile one could get data mining you.  A search 
of google with just your domain name can show other lists you belong to 
and possibly more.  There are reasons I use a silly name like m0gely. 
For one, it's never taken. :)

Some folks take offense and make drama over inconsequential things.

There is no "lack of hardware drivers for the numerous Linux distros". What
there is a lack of is Linux drivers that will satisfy both the needs of
corporations for profits and the needs of the "open source community" for
freedom of software. So the free as in speech drivers have limits in their
capabilities, and the non-free ones have limits in the way you can legally use
them. For example, I'm perfectly happy with the non-free-speech "nvidia"
drivers on my new machine, because I get twice as many frames per second with
them. If that pisses off Eric Raymond or Richard Stallman, well, too bad. :)

I buzzed through all of the desktops/window managers at one point before
settling on Windowmaker. I had trouble with the fonts on some of the really
light ones, like blackbox, fluxbox and IceWM -- they were just too small. There
may have been some way of getting bigger ones, but I couldn't find it.

I could never figure out how to work Afterstep -- it did weird things that I
couldn't understand. Enlightenment was interesting, but I found myself spending
a lot of time messing with the settings. XFCE 4.2 was acceptable, but 4.4 was
almost as big as Gnome. So I ended up with Windowmaker, and that's what I run
today. I think Enlightenment was a close #2 -- if you want or need 128
desktops, that's the way to go. :)

I think KDE is probably a lost cause, but I still think you can lighten Gnome up
to the point where it's competitive with XFCE and possibly even Enlightenment
and Windowmaker.

I haven't tried fasterfox, but so far I've had pretty good luck with Seamonkey.
It won't do RSS feeds, but other than that, it does everything Firefox and
Thunderbird do as far as I can tell. "Dillo" is a really light browser, but
there are lots of sites that do stuff "dillo" can't handle.

So, Scientologists (or whoever) could, say, redact everything posted  
to a list they didn't like, by impersonating users?

So, not only censoring *your* own individual words, but *also* the  
words of others? I'm pretty sure that won't fly. Reality is not  
something people will happily allow others to re-write.

Personally knowing a few people who participated in the Froistad  
matter (to save you some googling, he confessed in an online email  
listserv to intentionally murdering his own 5 year old daughter,  
years after it was thought to be an accident), I can say with some  
certainty (after much discussion with them) that once a cat is out of  
the bag, there's no getting rid of it. Once somebody has hit send,  
and "published" their message, they might as well have printed it in  
a thousand copies, and nailed it to telephone polls, mailed a copy to  
the library of congress, and hand-delivered a copy to their mother.

Froistad: Can you remove my online murder confession?
List Manager: uhm, no. You published it to thousands of hard drives  
all over the world. Any of the places you chose to publish to, by  
posting, can make their personal archives public at any time..... See  
you in 25-30 years.

If there is rampant identity theft, there can also be rampant false  
requests of removal (in your proposed scheme). So, an enemy could  
request all posts of yours be removed, except for the joke you made  
involving sheep and cliffs.

As far as private communications systems, that are *not* archived,  
those certainly do exist (in a few places), but all parties have to  
agree to not capture or store that information. When you're deep  
inside certain industries (such as working with TOP SECRET or Q  
information) releasing that data is enforceable by 10 years of jail,  
per infraction.

Everything else, by default, is slowly getting archived (in the US)  
for SARBOX reasons, liability reasons, and system restoration reasons.

If you don't want to be archived, you need to have a pre-arranged  
agreement with all parties involved that they will not archive....

It's not that far from being taped at the super-bowl. If you don't  
want to have your actions recorded by anybody with a camera there,  
don't go there.

If you want to be on an email list without anybody archiving the  
list, you have to be on a list where all parties agree to not  
archive, and there is some form of enforcement/penalty for doing so.

Yes.

If your post history is 95% asking questions, and 5% answering  
questions, people will know ahead of time that you are more  
interested in having others do your work than doing it yourself and  
helping others. It's discrimination against people who are unhelpful  
to the community, against "vampires" who want to suck from F/OSS  
rather than pull their own weight.

There is an actual solution to this, of course.

Spend more time helping others, as compared to asking others to help  
you.

If somebody googles you, and sees 300 helpful responses, and one  
silly question, they will know that you will be capable of helping  
them. If they see 300 posts about breaking into machines, and only  
one post about preventing breakins, they will again have an accurate  
picture.

HA!  Try "Michael Moore" ... this is why I no longer use my surname in
my "from" or sig.  It's not worth dealing with the blowback.

Of course, most of us named "Michael" are at some risk of having our
name co-opted by someone who makes headlines along the way.  It *was*
the most common male baby name in the U.S. for about 40 years.

Still, it could'a been worse.  My father wanted to name me Wolfgang; my
mother, bless her heart, said no.

There, that's now archived on the Internets for all time.

I've wondered if the "x-no-archive" header on Usenet really works.  Just
because the header exists doesn't mean someone isn't archiving it
somewhere.

A much easier solution, a much more effective solution, is to use
an email address not traceable to you to post items you don't want 
to be associated with you in an archive.  

Michael (Robinson) you've gone by several email names here.  You 
know how simple it is to set up another address for yourself.

I fully agree.  And I suggest that the mechanism of censorship be 
either self restraint or posting from an alternate email account.

No distrimination intended.  I was sincerly wondering what you thought the 
problem was.  I've reconnected the paragraph I was replying to and my reply so 
it can be (somewhat) clearer what the conversatoinal flow was. 

Michael Robinson in reply to my rant about spam:

> it would be a real challenge to tune it for.

That depends on what you mean by a lot.  My spam tools are consistantly keeping 
the flow down to about one an hour, over the last week it's dropped to just 
10 or 11 a day.  At the same time the spam tool collection is filtering and 
discarding thousands of messages a day.  Excellent performance. 

Michael Robinson again:

> that you are ready to rant and rave.

First of all, it was Michael Rasmussen, not Rogan, that made the statements
you're replying to.  So take it up with me, not Rogan.

The rant was totally about tactics of spam filtering and the futility of 
using email address changing as a method.   It said nothing to or about you.

Where did you see a PCMCIA card option?  The wireless option I clicked
through to was an Intel PRO/Wireless 3945a/g mini-PCI card.  That's
the same card thats in all those Centrino laptops out there that work
just fine with Linux.

Be careful equating "built-in" to "doesn't work with Linux".  The
make/model of the wireless controller matters more than whether it is
permanently attached to the system or not.

Message-ID: <c834ec80705291032t5a7267fcjc0f29e5074e09c6e@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to migrate to Linux at work, but there are a few
"must-have" apps that I'm having issues with:

    * Word (OpenOffice doesn't cut it.  It can't read/write .doc files
with high enough reliability.)
    * Visual Studio
    * Visio

The reason these are "must-have" apps is that I have to be able to
interact with other people who use them -- I could (and do) accomplish
the same results with entirely OSS tools, but I'm not aware of
anything that will say, read and write visio files, and let me create
XP-themed UI mockups.

I'm considering getting Crossover Office to run Word and Visio, and
I'm working on linux ports of our software, so VS may not be a lasting
issue.  In the meantime though, I still need to use these apps, so
I've installed vmware player and made a 35gig image of my old XP pro
install.  I've done this sort of thing in the past with Win2k on a
dual-proc (2x 1ghz T-bird) machine, but now I'm on a single-core
Athlon 64 (running 32-bit Feisty) and I'm having horrible performance
problems.

The issues seem to be tied to disk thrashing -- the drive is
constantly active while VM Ware is running, and the XFCE performance
monitor reports 100% processor activity (although Top shows minimum
levels of activity ~12%).  Native Linux apps run just fine while VM
Ware is going, but anything in the virtual machine is extremely slow.

I have installed the vmware tools, and I'm using VMware Player, as
opposed to VMWare workstation, which I was using before with success.
I'd give VMWare Workstation another try, but I've seen indications
that vmware player works just fine for some people on line.  Could the
size of the image be the problem? (35 gigs -- *much* larger than any
virtual machine I've used in the past.)

Any suggestions / ideas about VM Ware, or interoperating with the
windows apps above would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Rogan

How much physical memory does your host system have, and how much of
that have you allocated to the guest?  The disk thrashing could be
Windows using the page file, especially given what type of apps you're
trying to run.

1 gig now, should have another gig sometime in the near future.

I don't know how to allocate memory to the VM. with VM Ware player,
but it seems to use about 50% of my system memory, so it's probably
using 512.  As far as I can tell, tweaking memory allocation isn't a
feature of the free version of VMware (I could be wrong.)

Right, it is a feature of workstation, or of other ways to create/edit
the VMware image.  You should be able to edit the .vmx file directly
(while the VM isn't running obviously) and edit the memsize line.

Ah.. I hadn't thought to check the file.  I'd assumed it was binary.
As soon as I get this word doc printed, I'll move it up to 750 or so.

I should add that the guest runs extremely slowly even with no
applications going -- just opening the file explorer in XP takes a
very long time.  (I've turned off all the visual tricks and what not,
and it still seems to be thrashing.)

You can adjust it in the Windows Runtime version. I am not certain about 
the Linux version.  You can always use the free server version.  (I use it 
for creating VMs and then run them with the runtimes since that seems 
faster.)

Look at the VM menu.  The change memory allocation should be under 
troubleshooting.  (I can check the Linux version as I do not have my 
laptop with me today.)

Look at the vmx file associated with your image with a text editor.
The memsize value is what you are looking for to change memory being presented
to the program as real available memory.

I have not had much success running such Microsoft software on Linux  
using either VMWare or Crossover Office. I ended up just using a  
separate Microsoft Windows machine to run "microsoft only" software  
apps.

I checked the .vmx -- it is set to use 764 megs, which is about all I
can spare, so I'll just have to keep an eye on that when I upgrade to
two gigs of physical memory.

I went through the guest OS and disabled every resident program I
could find that wasn't required (mostly through msconfig).  It's
actually running much better now -- I think the thrashing was largely
due to an antivirus upgrade / scan that I postponed.

Thanks for the input :)

Others have suggested increasing the memory, a good idea.  You
should also use a shipping version of VMware, not a beta version. 
The beta versions of VMware are loaded up with debug stuff, which
slows it *way* down.

The currently available version of VMware Player 2 is no longer
beta.  There are sites such as easyvmx.com and others where you
can use an online fill-in form to create .vmx files, so you don't
need Workstation or Server for this task.

BTW, you should also set up host-based networking (with NAT to
get out to the net) and an internal samba server to store most
of your Windoze files.  This permits you to work with those files
from both operating systems, and use the faster and more robust
Linux file systems to access them.  Samba adds some overhead,
slowing you down, but it improves interoperability between your
few Windoze apps and your many Linux apps, and gives VMWare and
Windoze less disk management to do.  Imagine how slow the "swap
virtual guest memory" to "virtual page file" on a "virtual disk"
stored as a giant Linux file must be.  I don't know if a page
file accessed through Samba would be slower or faster, but it
would be an interesting experiment to try.

Ah, great to know!  I've been running 1.0.4, so I'm downloading 2 now.

Good point.  I'm using host-based networking with NAT, but I haven't
set up file sharing between my Linux install and the guest OS yet.

Might try running procexp.exe from www.sysinternals.com (think "top"
for Windows) in your Windows VM to see if something there is hammering
the disk.

What I meant to say is that my Gateway notebook as internal wireless  
(a.k.a. builtin); meaning I don't need to purchase a wireless NIC to  
place in the PCI slot in the notebook. At the time I was trying to  
troubleshoot this, there was much information on the Ubuntu Forum,  
but it required more of my time than I wanted to spend on it; I found  
it a better use of my time to use a Linksys Wireless card and insert  
it into the notebook's PCI slot. I also tried some other Linux  
distros (such as Mandrake) to see if it would automatically detect  
the internal wireless, and it didn't.

I think any Linux distro can increase their user base if they can get  
their "standard" installation to automatically detect the internal  
wireless like it can with the ethernet NIC. I really like using my  
Ubuntu Linux laptop, but sometimes the small things that don't work  
just "get to me".

When I find some time to troubleshoot this some more, I will explore  
help from this group.

 I still remember running Enlightenment on top of GNOME as the WM and GM for
RedHat 6/7, for a long while I never thought of running E without the GNOME
panel and other bits.

Getting any current release of GNOME running as slim as XFCE or WM would be
a feat indeed ;)
Enlightenment has quite a bit more eye-candy so isn't so far off...

Actually FasterFox is a plug-in extension to regular Firefox, and SwiftFox
is a specifically compiled optimized Linux version of Firefox with several
speed optimizations and other tricks.  I run it but haven't measured any
huge noticeable difference.  It is "fast" but I can't tell you exactly how
much faster it is than regular Firefox.

Thus the fasterfox plug-in will work with Firefox on Linux, Mac, and
Windohs.  Swiftfox is only for Linux on Intel/AMD.

Fasterfox:
http://fasterfox.mozdev.org/

Swiftfox:
http://getswiftfox.com/

NB that some network admins would consider the pre-fetching that these do to
be "uncool" from a network load standpoint (so I've heard anyway).

At any rate if you are looking for lean 'n' mean, any Firefox should be a
bit better than the full SeaMonkey suite.  The real small browsers like
Dillo would work even better, for simple pages.  For complex stuff you have
to find a happy middle I suppose.

1. If your main requirement is to communicate with Windows users, you 
probably ought to be running it the other way around -- a Windows host 
and a Linux guest.
2. VMware ain't magic. Every byte of memory the host and guest uses has 
to really be in the machine. Every CPU cycle the host and guest execute 
must get executed. And every byte that gets written to disk, permanently 
or temporarily, has to get written to disk. In other words, if you're 
trying to jam two workloads into one machine with VMware, you're gonna 
be slow.
3. I haven't done much testing with VMware player -- schlepping around 
even 4 GB (compressed!!!) disk images is a non-starter. It takes time to 
burn them to a DVD, time to copy them from machine A to machine B, etc. 
As to free server versus paid-for workstation, I don't have a lot of 
experience, but Workstation has a lot more flexibility than the free server.

In short, do your homework, don't expect miracles, you get what you pay 
for, your mileage may vary, offer void where prohibited by law, and 
lions bite. ;)

I've been called stupid by someone claiming to be German because of
the whois information for my site.  Thing is, what am I supposed to 
do differently with my whois records?  The Germans are superior idea
because German whois listings don't give any revealing information 
is an idea that seems to help hide spammers instead of revealing them.
Having a valid address for a domain if you get spam from it gives you
a place to paper mail a complaint.  A phone number, someone to call.

American whois databases tend to be filled with real names, addresses,
and phone numbers.  Is this foolhardy?  What will register.com say
if I try to change all but the billing address to say: 

No paper mail recipient, 
No street address, 
No state or zip code?

How do you stop people from knowing what lists you are subscribed 
to via google?

I've never gotten good performance with XP as a 
virtual machine even if I try to run it as a 10gig
image.  XP seems to be simply far too heavy for 
emulation.  

There is XPLite which might help, but I've never actually
purchased a copy so I can't say for certain that it will 
help.

Another option is to make a substantial contribution to
the ReactOS project now and down the road run the first
beta or better vmware image of it that comes out in player.

I hear that crossover office supports some versions of 
Office, but not the current releases.

2000 seems to work a whole lot better than XP under
vmware where 2000 is the oldest version of Windows you 
can still get the updates for if you hurry.  Office 2003
and Visual Studio, at least a student copy I have, work
in 2000.  If you want an order to install updates in,
ask me.  Don't let Windows Update put them on, search
for them via Windows Download Center!!!!!

I've been trying to find out if a 486 DX2-66 
with 20 megs of ram can be used to access the
horde framework.

I started with a minimal install of Redhat 6.2, 
added X, and got twm going.  Tab window manager 
has to be the lightest one there is.  So far, if 
I wait five to ten minutes after clicking 
something inside the horde framework via 
Mozilla 1.1, it will render.  Is the minimum to 
access the current horde framework smoothly a 
Pentium 200 MMX system with at least 128 megs 
of ram?  I could see about increasing the ram 
to 32 megs and throwing in a 100 mhz 486, but 
why bother if that won't be enough?

I am running horde 3.1.3 on my servers.

Is there a way to run Mozilla on a faster X 
enabled machine and redirect the output to 
the 486?  I have been predominantly studying
Freedos on this machine where EISA 486's are

I merely meant that I started with your name and domain name and went 
from there.  Because you use your own personal domain email, it's much 
easier to narrow down on you.  I'm not saying people should fear doing 
that, it's just a fact.  I would imaging someone who is /concerned/ 
about being identified wouldn't do this.

I have seen for an extra fee, you can privatize your whois info without 
upsetting ICANN rules.  I've not looked into this for more than 20 
seconds so I don't understand anything of how it works.  But one could 
try that with their domains.  Also, PO boxes could be used instead of 
physical addresses as well as other creative ideas possibly.

Use an email that is not associated with your actual name or domain 
name.  The account that comes with your ISP, or gmail/hotmail/yahoo 
should work.  If you hit up google for "m0gely" your going to know alot 
about me pretty quick.  But none of it is linked to anything other than 
the name m0gely.  But even if a person used two or three screen names 
when subscribing to online forums it wouldn't be easy to link them together.

My main requirement is a workstation that I can bear to work with on a
daily basis, and do so without loosing productivity :)  Most of what I
do is code (in java, c#, haskell, lisp or perl) and crunch data
generated by the tools created in the coding phase :).  Both these
steps are infinitely easier for me in a linux environment, and often
these things become very processor intensive, so running that
environment as a guest is sub-optimal.

After turning *everything* down re: visual effects (but keeping the
resolution to 1280x1024 or so), and disabling all the resident
processes that were running, it's working quite well.  I can use word
and visio (independantly, haven't tried them together) as quickly as I
can when running XP natively.

In some respects this setup is actually *faster*.  Because I do *all*
of the "dangerous" things in the linux host (email, browse, access
network shares, run programs... etc.) I'm comfortable turning off some
things that I would be unable to do if running XP as a host.  The
antivirus doesn't need to scan daily, for example, and I don't need an
XP-based firewall.  Those two things alone have freed up many, many
resources.

Thanks for all the help!

Any selinux experts here?

I am working with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 clone,  which comes
with selinux set to "enforced" mode by default.  I installed liblzo2
to work with openvpn.  When I ran it (as root), I got an error message
(linewraps added by me):

Starting openvpn: /usr/sbin/openvpn: error while loading shared \
libraries: liblzo2.so.2: cannot enable executable stack as shared \
object requires: Permission denied

When I set /etc/selinux/config to "permissive", the error goes away,
but then I get less security.

Is there anything simple I can do to so that selinux is happy with
this library, now and after some potential update in the future?

Message-ID: <465D14DC.3090902@dimstar.net>

I have a digi etherlite 32. Basically, it has one ethernet port, and 32 
serial ports.

It requires drivers that make it appear as 32 additional serial ports to 
the system the drivers are installed on.

I would like to find some bridge that allows me to assign a tcp/ip port 
to list on, and that connection would look at the designated serial port.

Maybe I'm making this too complicated and I just need to configure 
*getty, but my understanding is that's for going the other way. i.e. the 
serial port connects to the linux box, and getty handles the serial port 
part. I want to "telnet" to a designated tcp/ip port, and have that 
ethernet connection redirected through the designated com port.

I've done some googling, but nothing appears to be what I want.

Thanks in advance.

I don't know about that product, but ye-old classic terminal servers 
(like the original Cisco boxes) had a "reverse telnet" function where 
the serial ports are accessed via port 20xx, where xx is the serial port 
number.  I googled the digi box, and it claims to support "reverse 
telnet", but the details are not obvious.

You may not even get your video to work resulting in a Blue Screen. Now those 32 bit drivers for Linux we were talking about well they work just fine for Linux 64 bit. Why? Because they are open source and can just be recompiled. 64 bit runs way faster on a 64 or 128 bit computer. Now Microsoft and computer manufacturers know this and so they only install Vista 32 bit on their new computers. Sure they should run faster but because they only have Windows 32 bit on them they run as slow as the computers 3 years ago. Most people don't understand this. You on the other hand have used both Ubuntu 64 bit and 32 bit so you know full well what runs faster.

I installed Arch64 on my desktop for about two weeks.  The only thing
that seemed slightly faster (and I do mean "slightly," not "way faster")
than on my 32-bit installation of same was encoding audio to flac and
ogg.  My guess is that video encoding would have been slightly faster,
too, but I don't do much of that.  OTOH, the ripping process (from audio
CDs) was no faster, and that's what takes the most time anyway.
Everything else that I use my computer for was not perceptibly faster.
I'm sure there is plenty of usage that benefits from a 64-bit
environment on 64-bit hardware, but I don't have a need for it.  For
day-to-day "(stereo)-typical home usage" stuff, I can't see any
advantage of using a 64-bit installation, and plenty of pain that goes
with the lack of gain (some multimedia codecs, flash and other
proprietary bits-and-pieces that aren't available in 64-bit Linux or are
difficult to set-up).  It's not worth it, IMO.

Right. Dan's suggestion to grep for avc in /var/log/messages won't 
work in RHEL 5 and clones. You'll need to find the right bits in 
/var/log/audit/audit.log, but before you do that...

First, look at liblzo2.* using "ls -Z". The SELinux context should be

   system_u:object_r:lib_t

The last bit ("lib_t") is probably the most important. If your library 
doesn't have that context, use chcon to reset it:

   sudo chcon -t lib_t /path/to/liblzo2.*

Try openvpn again (under an enforcing policy) and see if that helps. 
If not, check back in and I'll post something about altering SELinux 
policies in RHEL 5.

Good luck. We successfully used the SCSI version of that product out 
at OGI, but the etherlite's always seemed flaky under Linux, and Digi 
isn't always superb at updating drivers...

Assuming you've got the Digi drivers installed and working, 
www.conserver.com is the software you'll want to use to interact with 
the serial consoles.

Anybody else getting "join flixster" spams, allegedly from real users?
This is a movie recommendation service, which looks like it would be
interesting in other circumstances.  However, in actual fact, when 
you sign up, they ask for the password for your email account (on
hotmail or gmail) and then use that to access your address book and
send out daily "invitations" to all your "friends" to join flixster.

One of the participants in a mailing list that I run was dumb enough
to sign up for flixster.  I've warned him, and got him on moderation,
but the daily spams (coming from their email accounts, not flixster)
are becoming a nuisance.  I will probably remove him from the list.

The CEO of flixster thinks this is legitimate, "because youtube and
linkedin and others do it".  No they don't.  Lying bastard.  If 
anybody hears of a class action lawsuit against this bastard, and
the venture organizations funding him, I would be glad to join.

If anyone here is stupid enough to join flixster and give them the
password for their email account, that person is getting blacklisted
on my email server and hopefully on the plug lists.

   Er, no. Linkedin does _not_ do that for certain. I've been signed up with
them for years (uselessly, so far), and only infrequently get an e-mail
message from them.

   Why not get a class action lawyer involved yourself? Google turns up 1.3
million of them (probably not all in Portland), and I'm sure you'll find at
least one who's interested.

Go get 'em, Keith!

Dear Keith, 

One RHEL 5 SELinux tool I've found helpful is the Setroubleshoot
browser. Yup, it's a GUI tool, but it includes a library of problems and
solutions. You can start it with the sealert -b command.

If it's works for you, it should suggest chcon commands at least similar
to what Paul suggested earlier.

Good luck,
Mike

Message-ID: <C94E0348-837D-4C4D-A70B-0B4B3D169004@scottshill.com>

I have a been leading a development project of a database app that is  
built on a LAMP-variant platform (it uses Gentoo Linux, Apache,  
PostgreSQL AND PHP) along with some CPAN perl modules and MapServer.  
We seem to have problems with updates to the individual LAMP tools  
not working with the other LAMP tools. For example, if we update  
Apache with a security update, then we experience with features in  
the app not working in a perl mod or PHP etc.

I recently got back from a business trip, and I sat next to someone  
on the airplane that does LAMP database application development. I  
shared with him this experience, and he agreed with me that this is  
an underlying problem with developing in a LAMP environment/platform.  
This results in increasing our labor/time costs in maintaining the  
infrastructure of the application. I would like to hear other  
experiences with this issue - if any.

So auditing is on in RHEL5 by default?

The docs disagree:
http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-5-manual/Deployment_Guide-en-US/sec-sel-analystcontrol.html

Though looking now, I see auditd running on an CentOS 5 box and avc
messages going to audit.log. Looks like the afore-linked docs are
wrong...

I may have misspoken (miswritten?). All my CentOS 5 installations have 
been done with kickstart set to enforcing:

   selinux --enforcing

That may result in a non-standard configuration.

I am pretty sure the docs are correct, I belive I manually turned on
auditd (assuming you are looking at one of our EL5 boxes...)

Hi Ken,

This can be one of the frustrating aspects of using Open Source software in
production.  Disparate development teams don't have to make sure everything
works with everything (which would be impossible) and sometimes upgrades
break seemingly unrelated pieces of software.

However, some distros  come pretty close to solving this issue -- by
offering "stable"  package collections.  Everything is tested and works
together.  Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, Centos, and Suse follow this practice.  You
lose some of the flexibility of running Gentoo -- but at least applications
"should" continue to work together without feature loss, when recommended
updates are rolled out.

Another option is to make sure you test all upgrades including patches on a
staging environment first -- and closely review whether or not you "really"
need the patch and at the same time review all the potential dependencies,
and then fix all the problems before rolling to production -- can take a lot
of time though.

As a sysadmin with a decent amount of LAMP and dependency-hell behind
me, I can only say that Jennifer's already covered what I would say,
and in much nicer words to boot.

But to reiterate: 
1. Be careful and consistent where you get stuff; mixing CPAN downloads
with distribution-packaged Perl modules is asking for trouble.
2. Be careful what and when you upgrade, and plan for breakage.
3. Use a separate test server.

If you want to go the grumpy-professional-sysadmin route:
4. Document things well enough that you can rebuild your
server/environment from an OS install CD and your PHP source.
5. Get a spare box, set aside a couple days and actually DO #4.
6. Try migrating the app to Debian or Centos.
7. Don't let devs have root access.

Oh, I was.

The docs state no auditing daemon is shipped with RHEL 5, which seems
to contradict the presence of auditd.

Why do you recommend Debian or CentOS over Gentoo? What are your  
thoughts about Ubuntu?

   It can be a problem even with parate development teams. SciPy versions
work with only specific NumPy versions, even though the core developer is
one and the same. :-)

   Add Slackware to this list. Unless a security patch upgrade comes out, I
don't upgrade from one release to the next, unless the specific application
fixes a bug or adds a needed feature. As long as what you have works,
there's no compelling reason to upgrade.

Red Hat has an additional product outside of the packages that come in 
RHEL.  I do not know if there is a Centos rebuild of them.

Although my name is not Aaron -- here's my take on selecting a Linux Distro:

* Make sure the distros stable version supports the software particularly
the version you need.  Talk to the entire development team AND the sysadmins
to make sure you aren't overlooking any dependencies.

* Do a little research into the package management software to figure out
what best suits your environment.  Apt vs Yum vs Up2date etc.

* Look at frequency of updates and make sure they jive with your development
cycles and operations' expectations.

* Check out frequency of security updates and "new" vulnerabilities

Essentially, you need to do a requirements assessment and then proceed.
Moving to a new distribution of Linux will have ramifications -- especially
if you and the Dev team/ SysAdmins are used to gentoo.

Personally, I don't really like the super-automated package managers, but
that's because I'm highly paranoid about even "tested" updates breaking
things.  Thus, I  still believe it's best to roll updates to a testing
server first if you are updating a production environment.

That being said -- I've come around to liking life the Debian/Ubuntu way --
makes for less configuration headaches.  I don't really like the package
management software for CentOS/RHEL, and  Redhat "seems" to be slower in
rolling out new application updates.

It was hard for me to stop compiling software and to move to using packages
(I'm going to take another look at Slackware (used way-back in the late
90's),  I like the idea of a super-clean install and good software version
management.), but I definitely think there is less pain involved if you are
running a production website.  Particularly, if you are managing a large
number of systems.

I would imagine that as gentoo users -- you and the rest of the team may
find this a little painful at first as well.

Strongly suggest sitting down and doing a requirements assessment before
deciding on a new distribution.

Jen

Jen,

   There's slapt-get and swaret. I've used only the first, and then only for
a particular purpose (installing the Freerock Gnome so I could run Gnucash).
Slapt-get manages dependencies; I've no idea about swaret. Many of the
SlackBuild scripts (they build Slackware-style packages totally compatible
with the distributed packages) include a list of dependencies.

I use vmware (workstation and server) everyday to do "real" production
tasks. As do a number of other people at my company. I've just skimmed this
thread, so please forgive me if I mention something someone already has. My
most heavily loaded host server is a dual proc 2.4G Xeon machine with 4GB of
RAM. It is running 7 Windows 2003 vm VM's, and two Windows XP VMs. Some of
my co workers run Visual Studio all day in vmware...

At any rate.

Rogan RE performance / disk thrashing - If you only 1GB of RAM in your host
machine and the VM wants 768, try _reducing_ the amount of memory allocated
to the virtual machine. It's likely that the disk thrashing is being caused
by the hosts needs, not the guests needs. start at 320 and go up from there.
My rule of thumb for desktop usage patterns is to leave 512mb of RAM for
host overhead, 256mb on servers for host overhead. Realistically, you need
more RAM in that machine to get good performance out of both the VM running
XP and apps on the host. It is also _really_ useful to have multiple procs /
cores to work with. If your current machine is uniprocessor, upgrading that
will give you a HUGE performance boost.

My apologies for not speaking clearly.  I meant to say, try migrating
your current setup to some other distro as a practice drill.  

I'll admit that I strongly prefer Debian or Ubuntu for my own setups,
because of the stability, long-term support and incredible selection of
packages.  CentOS is nice to use when I think the client might decide to
migrate to Redhat because of vendor-support issues.

With either one, I can usually install a distribution package for any
Perl, PHP or Python module I need, and it'll usually update smoothly and
autmatically.  When I can't, I can generate an RPM or DEB package
directly from CPAN or whatever, which gives me some of the advantages of
a packaged module.

Of course, I am biased by my inexperience; I haven't used Slackware,
Gentoo or any of the BSDs.

1. Are you running Gentoo stable?
2. Have you considered moving to an RHEL clone?
3. Have you considered Etch?

Gentoo is a moving target -- what you describe doesn't happen as often 
in distros that have a broad user base and QA standards for releases and 
security.

If you are happy with everything that your computer does, this makes
perfect sense. 

However, I will not be completely happy with my computer until it can
make my bed, clean my house, wash my clothes, cook my dinner, and get
me a willing, sexy date.

I want to thank all of you that have provided me answers to my  
question (e.g., about my challenges with applying various updates to  
the individual LAMP platform tools that result in breaks/bugs in the  
application that my team developed).

This is my first LAMP platform application project; I started it 4+  
years ago. I also have a few other Windows platform web application  
projects that I manage as well. Over the past 4+ years, I am  
realizing that my operations cost of the LAMP platform application is  
well exceeding my operations cost of my other Windows platform web  
applications. Much of this difference seems to be attributed to labor  
time on troubleshooting and debugging problems after an update was  
applied to one, or more, of the various LAMP tools.

I started this LAMP application project 4+ years ago, because I  
wanted to try and move my business away from the Windows platform  
towards LAMP. I thought such a move would lower my costs of doing  
business; however, this does not seem to be my experience. Are there  
others that have this experience?

I have found that there are two distinct types of problems.  One is
caused by the Linux distribution package maintainers, the other is
caused by the program/language developers.  The changes in packages are
usually the settings used to compile the packages (this can lead to
dependency changes).  These can usually be solved by downloading the
package source and re-making the package (or download the program source
and recompile the program).  This can lead to a DIY Linux system, which
has its own benefits and drawbacks.

The developers of programs/languages have varying attitudes about
backward compatibility.  The range is from "we don't care" to "we will,
at all cost, maintain backward compatibility".

It may be easier to look at the likely problems with the different
parts.

I've never had a problem updating database servers, though I have read
about them.  PostgreSQL does an extremely good job of maintaining
backward compatibility.  MySQL tries hard, but has a higher problem
rate.

Apache does a very good job of maintaining backward compatibility,
though they did make sacrifices to create a better product --
particularly in the jump to Apache2.  The problems that do arise are
usually caused by the linux distribution's change in features that are
compiled in by default.  This is the most likely reason to go to a DIY
system.

PERL is somewhere between MySQL and Apache.  If you use strictly
pre-packaged modules, you should be OK; however, there are a lot of
chefs stirring this pot, so YMMV.   Thoroughly test your own code before
upgrading.

PHP is a version nightmare.  They really don't make any attempt to
maintain backward compatibility, the compatibility that is there is only
because the PHP developers couldn't find an excuse to change it.
Distributions like Debian and RH are essential for maintaining pre-built
packages (including libraries) and the version dependencies.  For your
own code, lots and lots of testing is required before attempting an
upgrade.  Better yet, start from scratch with the new version.  Code
that is written for multiple versions is BLOATED because of this
attitude. 

Some people just don't upgrade because of this.

Hope this helps.

My own personal opinion is that PostgreSQL is an industrial strength 
RDMBS and MySQL isn't. MySQL 5 is *almost* there, but it doesn't have 
what it takes alongside of SQL Server, PostgreSQL or the biggies -- 
Oracle, Informix, DB2, etc.

The Apache 1.3 -- 2.x migration was an unmitigated nightmare, and quite 
a few sites haven't dared attempt it yet. I can't speak for IIS.

I forget when it happened, but at some point Perl changed some of the 
defaults to make it "easier" to work with Unicode. That broke a lot of code.

I don't use PHP -- hopefully I never will. As far as scripting languages 
and web frameworks are concerned, Ruby and Rails show great promise, but 
it's going to be at least another year before the cowboys have left and 
the stabilizers move in.

Subject: [PLUG] Smart greylisting...
Message-ID: <20070531042743.bbq6euw6o04k8s0k@web.robinson-west.com>

Instead of blanket greylisting, I want to restrict when I graylist
by looking at who on my list of recipients a sender wants to reach.

I'm interested in smarter ways to use graylisting than the old
blanket approach.

It want to restrict graylisting to when something appears to be
wrong with the source.  Maybe it's a dynamically assigned ip
address, one that isn't registered in DNS databases at all, or
maybe the helo/ehlo is something suspicious.

I think what I'm talking about is having the outcome of
one smtp filtering policy impact or prevent the application
of another policy.

Say I have a relay recipients list like so:

foo at example.com           graylist
abuse at example.com         x
mail-list at example.com     x

bar at example2.com          x
abuse at example2.com        x
mail-list at example2.com    x

Looking at the above list, understand that the x means let it
through without graylisting it.  Understand also that mail to
example2.com should not be graylisted because that is a
friend's domain I am a backup relay for.  Slowing down his
legit customers on accident is unacceptable.  This example
is not real life, any relation to real life is purely
coincidental.

Does anyone maintain a decent list of which sources cannot be
graylisted?  Are there any secrets to knowing when graylisting
should not be used?

I am using postfix, but that only matters when I try to
implement something.

Hello PLUG!

This is my first post to any user group so I apologize for my naivety.

My Background:
I have a little sysadmin experience on the Windows side and am comfortable
hacking away on the *nix side.  But I'm no guru.

My Situation:
Web developer with a non-Admin Windows account charged with creating an
internal site that gives users the ability to automatically authenticate via
their Windows Domain account.

My Chosen Path:
I decided on using a Linux web server with Apache2 in conjunction with
mod_auth_ntlm_winbind, Samba, Kerberos, OpenLDAP, and Winbind to connect to
our Domain Controller to get the user automatically authenticated when they
visit the site.

My Problem:
After a few weeks of fumbling, stumbling, and grumbling I've got it
working.  Except it stops working 5 minutes after I start the winbindd
service.  After looking online for an answer I've found only one solution to
the problem - upgrading to the latest Samba.  So I compiled it and got it
working....for 5 minutes.  Fails with the same error after the same amount
of time.

My Wish:
I wish someone could help me figure out what I've done wrong or choose
another, easier path for me to follow to reach my goal.  I'll now plop my
config files below as well as any other pertinent information that I know
about my problem.

It might be easier to just use mod_auth_kerb.  I've seen this work
when authenticating
against an MIT KDC hosted on a unix box.  And I've heard that all you
have to do to get
it to authenticate against an AD server is to edit the config file.

Could it be exactly 301 seconds after starting(ticket_lifetime)?  It
acts like the
box cannot renew tickets.
The box needs to be joined to the domain.

If you were using Fedora I would recommend the Fedora Directory Server.
It helps getting this setup correctly.

Thanks Larry,
Yes this computer was added to the domain with:

net ads join -U [USERNAME]

and got the following in return:

Joined [HOSTNAME] to realm DOMAIN.COM

I've changed the krb5.conf file to say 61d instead of 301d and it still
fails after 5 minutes.

I will take you up on your offer, and offer a different, easier solution. 
This is one I use at my job all the time.  If you were to do a packet
trace of an HTTP conversation in an AD environment, you would see that
there is always an NTLM-auth header in each request.  All you need is to
decode this header, and you'll have your NT username.

With this approach, your web server and webapps do not need to be
AD-aware, and you do not need samba, and you do not need any fancy apache
modules.  You just need to be able to read request headers in your
server-side code, and decode the BASE64 mess in the NTLM header.

Here's a java solution.  This is floating around on google in various
places.  I think it may have originated at sun.com.

public static String getUsernameFromAuthHeader(HttpServletRequest request,
                                               HttpServletResponse

Derek,

I can confirm your comment about PHP being a version nightmare. When  
we test an update to PHP on a QA box/server and then deploy the  
update to the Production box/server, we still experience problems/new- 
bugs in the application. My development team refers to these problems  
as "regression bugs", and these "regression bugs" are what's driving  
up our operating costs (e.g., we perform a update to the LAMP tools,  
and the application we developed breaks). I don't have nearly as much  
of this problem with my Windows platform web applications. Maybe that  
is the trade-off with using LAMP versus Windows; one pays the license  
fee for the server OS, SQL Server database, IIS, etc. and one gets a  
little bit more reliable platform??? This has been a very interesting  
experience for me in realizing total ownership/operations cost (TOC)  
with open-source software.

Ken,

The problem is more likely with your choice of development software as
opposed to the Open Source Platform.  PHP is prolific these days, because it
"appears" to be easy to install and use for rapid development -- but the
thought of using in production still makes me shudder, primarily because of
security issues, and the constant need to update, because of those security
issues, and the very fact that the accessibility encourages sloppy
deployment.   You would probably be having fewer problems if you used Perl,
Python, or Ruby and one of the associated rapid development frameworks for
your application development.

Postgresql is enterprise-class as is the Apache HTTP server, (and I think
MySQL is starting to catch-up with Postgres).  Much more so then IIS and
SqlServer (that statement comes from years of experience running
highly-available large-scale web-applications in production on multiple
platforms).

Window's updates can cause just as many -- if not more application problems,
particularly if you are not using all of the prescribed MS software exactly
as you "should."  Most  Windows admins I know send out warnings and wait
until the building clears to run their updates, and still have stories about
regular weekend outages due to security updates.  Upgrading to a new version
takes months of planning and testing.  And if you want to just fix something
yourself -- it's impossible, you have to wait for Microsoft.  Sometimes you
want to implement new features -- but can't because you need to wait, once
again for Microsoft.  Plus, you have to schedule regular reboots.

There is no substitute for good process and planning in application
development -- this also applies to web, and infrastructure projects,
regardless of your platform.  There seems to be a tendency for people to
think that Open Source software is quick, easy and you don't have to follow
the rules, using PHP and maybe LAMP in general for development seems to
especially promote this line of thinking.

Also remember, you don't have to make all the recommended updates.  If
something is working and it's secure then don't move, unless there is a
major security problem and a new feature that you want to implement.

Before abandoning Open Source -- I highly recommend that you examine other
forces that may be leading to increased development costs.  And do another
requirements analysis.

Jen

It sounds like your QA box is different than your production box in ways 
your developers don't account for or the configuration files from 
machine to machine aren't getting moved over.  PHP has changed a default 
configuration values from version to version but if you have your 
php.ini file (or whatever configuration files you use) configured with 
the values your application requires that shouldn't be a problem.

This depends on your situation Ken, but you have to look at the whole 
picture.

  Were you using php on windows?
  Were you running apache on windows?
  What was your development cost?
  How was the performance on the hardware?
  How was your (and your customers' data) security?
  How was your uptime?
  What was the licensing cost?
  Were you keeping up with your competitors' features?
  Why Gentoo?
  How is your test coverage?
  What is the bottom line?

If the bottom line is better on windows, sure.  If you're making more 
money running linux, but having trouble keeping current on the 
administration, look at outsourcing that to a local monitoring and 
maintenance crew.

My experience with Gentoo was that it required a lot of care and feeding 
vs a binary packaged distribution, particularly Debian.  Debian 
gracefully runs multiple versions of apache, etc.  There's some 
friction due to naming if you run into a source package that 
assumes /etc/apache/ or whatever, but they've done a really good job of 
keeping things straight.  If you're in a situation where you need to be 
building from source or otherwise running a special configuration, look 
at stow/xstow for managing multiple source-built versions.

I'm running 3 servers, 4 laptops, 2 workstations (and 5 nodes that only 
run distcc) on Debian (with an apt-proxy for speedier package pulls.)  
Sure, that takes more of my time than one windows box did 6 years ago, 
but none of my software has ever broken from "just plain usage" and the 
capabilities with Linux are way more than with windows, particularly 
when you start maintaining more than one box.  Uptime is great -- I 
never reboot anything unless upgrading the kernel.  But what really 
matters to me are the tools.

  bash, head, tail, grep, sed
  ln -s/stow
  gvim
  svn/svk
  ssh
  rsync/tar
  aptitude
  gcc/distcc
  perl/python
  apache
  imagemagick/pdftk/potrace
  gimp/inkscape

Sure you can run most of those on windows, but it really hurts.  You 
can't have symlinks though.

>When we test an update to PHP on a QA box/server and then deploy the

I would recommend assessing that situation.  If your devs each run linux 
with a full stack on their workstation, plus you have a staging/ 
failover server before you hit the production box, that's a much better 
situation and likely to yield gains in many areas besides smoothing the 
upgrade cycle.

If you've got two boxen and you still see problems when you deploy, 
there's something missing in that process.  You have to bring the QA 
box to exactly the point where production box will be.  Consider making 
them interchangeable to the point where you can flip a switch to deploy 
a fully-tested server and then bring the downed box up to current.  
This might require separating your database server (and maybe 
templates+code) onto a third box, but that all depends on your 
availability requirements.

What does your deployment script look like?  How about the failover 
process?  Does a computer call somebody's pager when a box goes down?

Further, if you're not using a large number of the aforementioned tools 
throughout the development/deployment/monitoring process, you're really 
missing out on a lot of potential productivity and quality gain.  Also 
see:  test coverage.

E.g.  I'm building dotReader (http://dotreader.com) -- a 
Windows/Mac/Linux GUI application.  All of my development and most of 
my build, testing, and deployment automation happens on Linux because 
it is more efficient that way.  On the windows build box, I run cygwin 
because otherwise I would spend all of my time operating a mouse and 
couldn't automate anything remotely.  Compiling source code on windows 
is still painful.  Bugs directly attributable to the fact that it is 
still entirely based on a 22-year-old's port of CP/M don't help either.

The "you get what you pay for" is still true in open source.  The 
difference is that you can pay for it in either time or money.  
Similarly, you have a lot of options (hint: of the three that start 
with P, the best ends in "erl".)

I haven't dealt with many PHP upgrades, but I've read a lot of PHP code 
and can say "rigor" is never a term that came to mind.  The language 
just doesn't support anything remotely resembling engineering or 
security discipline -- it was all thrown out in favor of ease of 
learning.  Perl on the other hand, has a long history of performance, 
security-mindedness and careful integration plus power, usefulness,
and the fairly-recent addition of a strong "test,test,test" attitude to 
the culture.  CPAN may not be vetted, but it is *huge* and there is a 
lot of well-thought-out infrastructure to support testing, bug 
tracking, upgrades, etc.  See also:  "waterbed theory of complexity."

"What works for you" of course applies.  Remember though that the tools 
and processes associated with *nix (and its culture) have a long 
history of hard-won experience and careful thought.

And, as always, "if it hurts, you're doing it wrong."  If you (and your 
team) have read "The Art of Unix Programming" and everything I've said 
here is old-hat and you've gone through checking all of the boxes and 
running all of the numbers and windows is a better choice then so be 
it.

I just checked the Red Hat Network and audit-1.3.1-1.el5 is listed in
the RHEL 5 channel. So that part of the docs is indeed wrong...

Another reason to go with OpenBSD... systrace and good docs. :)

Thanks Carlos,

I've implemented this solution using PHP and I'm wondering if this is
secure.  Your solution depends on making sure the user agent sends the
windows authorization information with the http request.  If the user uses
mozilla or has the Logon option turned off of Internet Explorer, they will
be prompted for a username/password.  At this point they can enter any
information they want and it will grab whatever they input and store it.

Am I missing something?  Do I perhaps need something in an .htaccess file
for the directory I'm wishing to authenticate?

Thanks,
Josh

Eric,

You give a great overview of *nix programing, and greats words of  
advice above. I don't want to give up on developing web apps in an  
open-source platform. I seem to be experience more and more of a  
preference from current and potential work projects to be done on the  
Windows platform. Sometimes one has to go where the work is.

You're not missing anything.  You should get the popup authentication
dialog box in non-IE browsers.  A user could enter anything they want in
the box.  Whether this is acceptable depends upon your level of security
need.  In an office like mine, where most people have their passwords
taped to the bottom of their keyboards, and managers have their
secretaries log onto the network and into ERP as them to do their work,
it's not such a big deal.  My company decided that they want to be secure
from external threats, but we trust our employees well enough.  The only
info we hide from employees is payroll information.  We're located in
Hailey, ID, which is a very honest place.  I haven't used my bike lock
since moving here from Eugene, and I don't even know if I am in possession
of a key for my house!  Security paranoia is not my strong suit.

You could always hand the username/password to an ASP or .NET script
running on an IIS server.  This would let you use native Windows tools to
validate the username/password against AD.  This is not as good as
kerberos, of course, because there is no ticket, and no 5 minute window. 
If you do this, you don't want to pass the username and password in the
request.  I always insert the username/password into a table, using the
sessionid as a unique key.  I pass only the sessionid to the next page. 
The next page looks up the username/password from the table with this key.
 This makes it impossible to find out a username/password by sniffing the
web traffic.

If your enterprise has an authenticating web proxy, the user will have to
use valid credentials to authenticate to it when they make their first
page request.  This will set the NTLM header with valid data.  By the time
they get to your page, they will have already been through this step, and
the NTLM header will be valid.

Even in IE, a hacker could forge the NTLM header.  As you can see
yourself, it is not encrypted, merely obfuscated.  If this is not secure
enough, do not use my method.

Here's a discount code(15%) for the Ubuntu Live conference.  There are 
larger discounts for students, non-profits, etc., so be sure to check 
that you are using the highest applicable discount.

At this price point I'm not sure whether I will attend.  If nothing 
else, it makes sense to register for the exhibit hall since that is 
free.  BTW, the exhibit hall pass for OSCON is also free.

The price goes up after June 4th, with the exception of the exhibit 
hall, which remains free.

What is the date(s)/time(s) for Ubuntu Live? I think I may be out of  
town during this time, but I want to confirm.

I could have gotten 65% off with student discount, but even after that
the price is too much considering what I might get out of it. There's
not much there for desktop users. But I did register for the Exhibit
Hall on Monday. It would be nice to see a list of exhibitors, but I
suppose it is too early.

You make reference to the LUG group discount, where can I find that?
