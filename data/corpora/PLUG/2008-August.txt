Subject: [PLUG] Who's in charge of this group? - Inter group meeting
 BerkeleyTIP-Global August 2 Saturday
Message-ID: <1217596322.5803.1266497269@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello from Berkeley, PLUGers :)

Please tell me - who is in charge in this group?

I ask because I'm wondering: who are the person(s) who might be the ones
to help arrange & coordinate an inter group meeting?

I wonder that, because I'm putting together a great new event, a global
GNU(Linux)/BSD type software & free culture meeting.

It is a meeting for people interested in learning about, using &
creating GNU & BSD type software & culture.

I call the local Berkeley meeting the BerkeleyTIP - 
  (Talks, Installfest, Potluck & ProgrammingParty)

And I call the global simultaneous set of local meetings the
Berkeley-TIP-Global meeting.

I'm wondering
1) If anyone at your group might be interested in joining together in
this event with others around the world, and if so, then
2) who might be the person(s) to head up handling arrangements, &
coordination, etc, for the joint meeting?

If this sounds to you like it might be interesting, here is some info
for you to read:

=====  CONTENTS:
1) THE BASIC FACTS ABOUT THE MEETING
2) WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR
3) WHAT TO DO NEXT
4) JOIN WITH US TOMORROW, AUGUST 2, SATURDAY
   FOR THE FIRST BerkeleyTIP-Global-USA MEETING?
5) VIDEO TALKS FOR AUGUST 2 MEETING
6) SUMMARY

=====================================================================
=====  1) THE BASIC FACTS ABOUT THE MEETING  =====

The basic idea is a monthly meeting, a full day at the beginning of each
month, the first Saturday of each month, simultaneous throughout Earth,
with these four components:

There are 4 PARALLEL TRACKS of activities:
1) TALKS        Talks by various speakers (stream/DL video globally)
2) INSTALLFEST  Bring your computer & install BSD or GNU/Linux software.
3) POTLUCK      Bring food to share or $5: eat, chat (optional)
4) PROGRAMMING PARTY     Write SW on your. or a group. project

We will have IRC & VOIP communications between the groups, enabling
information sharing, & work on development projects, etc.  It's like a
GNU-Linux user group meeting, on a global scale. Or, it's like a whole
earth GNU-Linux user group meeting.

=====================================================================
=====  2) WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR  =====

I'm doing this in my "spare" part time, as a volunteer effort for the
GNU(Linux)/BSD community.  By education I'm an electrical engineer (with
a bit of computer science).  I've been a GNU(Linux) user for about 10
years, and a member of San Francisco Bay Area & Silicon Valley LUGs for
that long.

When I decided to work on doing this, about 2 months ago, I decided to
just work slowly, steadily, & build it up a step at a time.

So far, we've had two successful local meetings here in Berkeley. A
first start up meeting, just to get together & talk & plan.  Next month
we worked on getting WiFi going at the meeting so it would be easy to
share an internet connection for everyone. We also got an IRC channel up
which the meeting attendees logged into.

Now, this month, I've gotten a Google Groups mailing list & web page for
both the local, & global groups.  And, I'm now working on sending out
the announcement about this meeting, & finding out which people at other
groups are interested in this.  And I'll try to work to help groups like
yours, that have members who are interested in this, get started in
getting connected with this meeting.

=====================================================================
=====  3) WHAT TO DO NEXT  =====

So, if anyone there is interested based on what I've said so far, there
are several things that could be done:

1) Reply to this email, letting me know what part(s) of this you,
personally, are interested in.
2) As part of that, discuss among your local selves if the individuals
who are interested would like to work to get a local simultaneous
meeting going.
3) Figure out who at your group would lead that effort, or would work on
arranging it.
4) Read the Berkeley-TIP-Global website, & join it's mailing list:
http://groups.google.com/group/BerkTIPGlobal

The Global group is open to anyone joining - not just the local group
leaders.  In fact, it is _encouraged_ that everyone interested in the
meeting join the list - the input on discussions from everyone
interested will benefit everyone else.

There is more to know about this event than I can put in this email. 
I've put much of that information up on the website, so I encourage you
to scan or read it over.  Hopefully that will answer most of the
questions you have.  If not, please join that group & post questions,
comments & suggestions for improvement to the mailing list.

=====================================================================
=====  4) JOIN WITH US TOMORROW, AUGUST 2                =====
=====     FOR THE FIRST BerkeleyTIP-Global-USA MEETING?  =====

If anyone in your group is a bit experienced, or up for some fun, you
might want to pull a meeting together & join with us tomorrow, Saturday
for our first effort to have a multi-site meeting.

This month, I'm just focusing on getting the word out to USA groups.  I
call this month the Global-USA effort.  In future months I'll expand it
to working to get groups connected from the Americas, Europe, then Asia.

It's easy to join in with us - 
1) Just find someplace with at least internet capability for IRC (better
if it could do VOIP, but that's not necessary for the first meeting) -
it could be merely someone's home or apartment, an internet cafe, or a
school or office room.
2) Post an announcement to your local list that everyone is invited.
3) Come to your local meeting & get on IRC with us.
4) Download some videos & watch them simultaneously with all the
participating groups.
5) Talk about the videos, or whatever, on IRC, or VOIP.

That's all there is to it.

=====================================================================
=====  5) VIDEO TALKS FOR AUGUST 2 MEETING  =====

For this first meeting, tomorrow, Saturday, I've scheduled the following
videos to watch (All times Pacific Daylight Savings Time, adjust for
local time accordingly.):

Subject: [PLUG] Apache2 Directory indexing in Etch not possible?
Message-ID: <8975a95f0808011104u4f2fc415p423c8ee8f8993f20@mail.gmail.com>

I need to enable directory indexing in apache2 running on Debian Etch (4.0).

After much digging, I've discovered that the mod_autoindex module
required to enable this functionality is missing. Normally, this is
compiled into the binary directly, but an "apache2 -l" reveals that it
is not. It also is not listed in the mods-available  directory, nor is
there an obvious package for it in apt.

Any thoughts? This is really basic functionality which I've never seen
so completely removed before. I assume it's a Debian thing, but The
Google reveals nothing so far...

-_-?

mod_autoindex isn't compiled into the etch apache2 binary; it's 
included as a loadable module in the apache2.2-common package:

   [heinlein at monk ~]$ dpkg -L apache2.2-common | grep mod_autoindex
   /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_autoindex.so

See also /etc/apache2/mods-available/autoindex.load.

I finally got to this as well. Someone had removed the .load for it
from this machine. Copied it from another install, and we are in
business. Thanks for the attention!

Subject: [PLUG] ReactOS about page...
Message-ID: <1217629476.29783.7.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I wonder what folks here think about the ReactOS about page.
  http://www.reactos.org/en/about.html

It sounds to me like the ReactOS people are saying that their system
will be better than everything else, which is a little silly IMHO.
UNIX to NT is comparing apples to oranges and I think the idea that
the NT architecture is inherently more secure than Unix is debatable.

Firefox 2 won't install to ReactOS 0.3.5 and 1.5 doesn't render
properly.  I don't know where the video bugs are coming from, but
they are pretty extensive.  0.3.5 may be an improvement over 0.3.4,
but it is awfully hard to tell.

I tried to put a complaint up, didn't go so well:

I'll be in town, but I presume people are already sick of hearing me talk. :)

I *am* going to be trying to feed it live over audio and video direct feed
though, including recording it for podcast.

Not that this would add any pressure... the first live-to-podcast PLUG
meeting. :)

I don't understand this response.  How is a blog going to elicit
the opinions of others on ReactOS's about page?  Should open source
projects to produce complete operating systems be pitted against
each other?  Do they have to compete?

justified, so I have to move and resize the window. I use Mozilla
on RedHat 8, if that helps.  Mozilla help pages don't help, and 
none of my references address the problem.  Any ideas?

Some people just write web pages poorly.  Or rather, whatever GUI tool
they use does it poorly.

If the problem is in their stylesheet (like maybe a hardcoded 'width'
setting) you might be able to unset the setting by turning CSS off
whenever you hit one of those pages.

If it's a page that you go to a lot, and you don't mind switching to
another browser, and learning a bit of CSS, then you can use the
'stylish' extension on Firefox to permanently restyle a page or
domain.

heck, if you don't mind using another browser, opera has a
"fit-to-width" option that you can turn on by hitting control-f11.
nearly all pages (super-ajaxy ones discluded) will get usably
reformatted (usually by shrinking the largest images and wrapping
text) to fit to the width of your browser window.

another "easy" shortcut is to go full-screen which will hopefully make
your browser window big enough, works in ie/ff/opera.  just one
keystroke there and back---f10 (i think?  i use a window manager in
which all windows are full screen these days so i haven't had to know
that for awhile =))

Don't send me private messages in response to public ones.  I don't need
to apologize to anyone who sends me a private response to a PUBLIC
message and gets a public response.  Nothing was said about replying
privately in your message nor do I think you should be going private

What is so bizarre about tracking other open source operating systems

I suppose the claim on the ReactOS forums that X is the worst piece
of software ever written isn't applicable to this forum.

So why are the reasons for ReactOS wrongheaded?  Why does ReactOS
need to die?  It has been around for 12 years.  It isn't a fly by
night project.  WINE is getting better, but there are still people
using Windows because program X doesn't run even under WINE in
Linux.

Yes, yes you do need to apologize. Jeme obviously thought criticizing
you publicly would not be appropriate. He was showing consideration by
not holding you up for public scorn. You threw that back in his face.
Perhaps you hoped that others would come to your defense? Well, you just
failed. I support Jeme's discretion.

Sadly, I don't share the same good sense. I've been pretty well behaved
on this list, but on other lists I've demonstrated a preference for
scorched earth policy. (Yes, I guess that's a threat. Chalk it up to me
being vain enough to think that everyone will benefit from hearing what
I have to say.) Because I've found that flamewars are rarely productive,
I ask that if you want to start a pissing contest you reply to me
privately.

Heh. Complete with a reply to the entire list.

Do I need to defend myself?  I wasn't aware that I needed to be
criticized.  Well, that's a nice.  Am I supposed to be impressed
that someone could flame me publicly?

There's an old saying, "Don't shoot the messenger."  Now, I want
to hear why the ReactOS project should die and what people think
about the Linux is so 1970's comment among other comments on the
about page.

Here are some of the comments on the ReactOS about page:

"Despite statements to the contrary, NT is secure by design. It was  
the first mainstream operating system with a proper implementation of  
a very flexible security model based on access control lists."

"UNIX operating system adhere to the file metaphor, and devices such  
as printers, storage devices, keyboards, and monitors all appear as  
ordinary files to both programmers and regular users. This simplifies  
many routine tasks, and is a key component in the extensibility of the  
system. The file metaphor has several downsides and it is known as a  
bottleneck of UNIX like operating systems.
ReactOS capitalizes on this metaphor and expands it. It uses an object  
metaphor that is pervasive throughout the architecture of the system.  
Not only are all of the things in the UNIX file metaphor viewed as  
objects by ReactOS, but so are things such as processes and threads,  
shared memory segments, the global registry database and even access  
rights."

"MacOS X, Linux, BSD flavors and other UNIX derivates share a common  
heritage based on a more than three decades old design of a simple  
basic operating system, that has evolved over time into a complex  
structure.
Modern incarnations like Mac OS X put a fancy graphical user interface  
on top of UNIX, to hide system details and focus mainly for beginners  
and likely advanced users are left out in the rain. In contrast,  
various Linux and BSD flavors have been put together originally for  
server usage and are therefore very console centric. Most advanced  
features cannot be accessed from the basic graphical user interface.  
Almost all UNIX flavors retain some of the original design flaws and  
binary compatibility between various versions is usually non-existent.

In theory there are a few UNIX standards like POSIX but in practice  
the standards are old and cover only the basic operating system and  
the terminal environment. Other standards such as the Linux Standard  
Base are often not implemented faithfully. As there is no user  
interface standard nor a standard API, most people still have to use  
command line applications or fight through the GUI mess. Many UNIX  
derivates use the de-facto standard X-Window system for graphical  
output, which might well possess one of the worst designs in software  
history.
Still, modern UNIX derivates are trying to catch up with recent  
innovations and some of them already possess important features like  
access control list support."

No, you need to suck it up and apologize. I don't care about ReactOS. I
am not going to discuss ReactOS. I do care that you've twice insisted on
replying publicly to someone who clearly prefers the discussion be off
list. 

If you want to make yourself look like a jerk in front of everyone, I'm
more than willing to help you realize your full potential. My preferred
approach is to mirror and magnify the comments and behavior of others.
It will do nothing to help you learn. But that's okay, because it's all
about grandstanding and getting attention anyway.

If you really wanted to learn something, you wouldn't have deliberately
ignored Jeme's request to keep the discussion private. You would have
either replied privately, or ignored him. If you really wanted to learn
something, you would have taken the topic to a forum that cared. I think
the deafening silence on list has already demonstrated that no one cares
to waste their time satiating your curiosity. Yet somehow you act like
you deserve a response. You must have a response! You _will_ get a

I haven't intentionally insulted anyone.  Jeme is out to lunch and

Actually, my father is a retired federal employee with a doctorate
in plant ecology and my mother has a college degree as well.

Here's a question, why doesn't someone speak out against this act
that Stuart and Jeme are putting on?  I am not amused at all.

If I wanted my inbox to be bombarded by petty arguments, I would have joined
the miss teen america forums. I did join to learn more about Linux in
general, but failing that, I'd be happy to unsubscribe from this nonsense.
Just wanted to see if we could keep this sort of stuff ...yeah, private...
instead of including the whole list on every ego-damaged drama post that
goes out? Possibly? Pretty please? I really do like the normal informative
posts that go back and forth here...

Nice try, but you can't distract me with your strange ReacOS fetish.[1]

([1] The astute reader will notice that this comment has no relation to
"someone's" reply. That is because the author wrote it after incorrectly
anticipating the reply. Despite much cajoling, the author could not be
convinced to remove it. The editor apologizes.)

We're not discussing ReactOS, We're discussing why you must be the
center of attention, who gave you the right to demand that others
discuss what you wish, and where you bought that atrocious shirt.

Suck _it_ up. I said you need to suck _it_ up. Completely different
meaning, though probably just as offense. Need to brush up those reading
skills I dare say. Getting rusty. Too much time thinking about what to
say next instead of listening to what others are saying perhaps?

A shame. A true shame. What is this world coming to?

Oh really? In message id
20080802130924.hz69fillccwcwgso at web.robinson-west.com we discover the
following:

Quoting Jeme A Brelin <jeme at brelin.net>:

> That's a gross violation of private correspondence and I don't

As you're probably too lazy to find the original message yourself, I've
found the public reply where you quote his private message despite a
request to not take things to the list.:
http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2008-August/059903.html

(No doubt because he didn't wish to spark a pointless flamewar.)

Hear that growling? That's your stomach saying you're the one who has
been skipping lunches lately.

Oh? Is it our responsibility then to amuse you? Have your poor
interpersonal skills made it difficult to make friends? Did mommy and
daddy never help you learn to play quietly by yourself?

As for an act, so far we seem to be the only two players. Your public
posting of his private criticisms sparked this. Jeme has so far behaved
appropriate in public, unlike us.

And since you seems to enjoy pointless cliches, let me remind you that
"They who sow the wind reap the whirlwind."

Now look what you've gone'n done. You've forced me to reply with a
hastily written collection of misspellings and poor grammar. I blame you
for all of my problems because (as it should be obvious to any observer)
they are not my own fault and must therefore be yours.

I call all to my defense! I have done nothing wrong! I have merely
decided the discussion must progress as I wish. Is that so wrong?

Instead of learning to behave myself in PUBLIC, let me instead offer the
following snip of procmail goodness:

>Guys, seriously.

Yeah, arguments like the one this could have been (before the etiquette  
of licking the butter knife came up) are why we have beer after the 
meetings, not really why we have a mailing list.  So what if reactOS is 
also going to get plan 9 wrong?  Surely there's a more suitable mailing 
list for that discussion?

Was there a question about how to configure bind for IPV6 in a chroot on 
nfs in ReactOS and I just missed it?

Maybe someone who has Mr. Robinson in their killfile could comment on 
just how surreal the conversations get when listening only to the 
replies?  Does RFC2821 have anything to say about mail via passive 
sonar?

Personally, I think they should be writing the kernel in arc++, but that 
probably presents a compatibility problem with word document macros 
unless they manage to JIT the VB or whatever, right?  Yeah, I'm failing 
to stay on topic here... Probably easier to just use dcop to inject 
random words from the dict file and hit send once it parses as valid 
cobol, but I think the cool kids are all busy watching mythtv via xmpp 
and/or twitter these days anyway.

It's not a fetish.  There is discussion in the ReactOS forums that is
anti Linux.  I would like it if someone would look into this and toss in
their two bits.  If enough people complain, it might adjust certain
attitudes in the ReactOS community.

Anyone who points something out or asks a question is asking to be
the center of attention.  I am no more guilty of seeking to be the
center of attention than the next guy who asks a question or tries
to point something out on here.

Which was after the fact.  I don't need to apologize, I'm the one
on the receiving end of insult after insult.

I started out trying to point out that ReactOS is being
promoted as, "better than Linux."  Perhaps someone can 
chime in and join me in an effort to try and persuade 
the ReactOS forum writers that the "ReactOS is the end 
all be all OS," attitude won't bring in developers or 
compress release times.  I'd like to see the criticisms
of MacOS X and Linux taken out of the overview section 
of the ReactOS FAQ.

Linux Plumbers Conference

Linux Plumbers Conference is a local Portland conference that will take
place September 17th-19th.  We are targeting developers working on the
low level programming of Linux, including the kernel, libraries, and
system applications such as udev, hal, and dbus.  We came up with the
name "Plumbers" because we wanted to represent these areas as the basic
system infrastructure.  We also wanted this to be a working conference,
where people solve plumbing problems instead of just yammering at each
other.

Linux Plumbers Conference
17-19 September 2008
Smith Memorial Student Union
Portland, Oregon USA
http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/

Early bird registration ends on August 18th, so register at
http://linuxplumbersreg.eventbrite.com/ before the registration fee
increases from $250 to $300!



Linux Plumbers Conference Student Day

LPC is also hosting a Student Day, catering to students who want to work
on plumbing infrastructure.  The Student Day includes hands-on tutorials
from local open source developers, an introduction to the open source
communities represented at the Linux Plumbers Conference, and a career
panel comprised of local open source companies.

Linux Plumbers Conference Student Day
16 September 2008, 9:00-17:00
Portland State Business Accelerator
Portland, Oregon USA
http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/program/students/

The $50 student registration fee includes admission to the Linux
Plumbers Conference, the Tuesday evening IBM-sponsored event at Aura
Lounge with Linux Kernel Summit attendees, and the Wednesday night
Intel-sponsored event at the Portland Art Museum.  Students should
register at http://linuxplumbersreg.eventbrite.com/

Students who wish to attend LPC Student Day must have been registered
as a full-time student for the last term of the 2007-2008 school year,
or be registered as a full-time student for the Summer 2008 or Fall 2008
term.

Why do you have to be a full time student to register?  Computer Science
isn't exactly the easiest field to get into.  Between the physics and
math requirements alone, CS is extremely challenging.  I guess I'm
wondering why part time students are excluded?

We mostly wanted to make sure someone wasn't trying to get a lowered
admissions price because they were just taking a PE class.  I'll talk it
over with the conference organizers and see if they're up for allowing
part time students to attend Student Day.  Would requiring students to
be registered for four credits or more seem like a reasonable
requirement?

I have a few questions
Why is Cox relaying a message supposedly from a Hotmail user? It should be
coming from a Hotmail server.
What type of sender verification do you have configured in Postfix?

It's likely contacting Hotmail, doing a basic EHLO, and RCPT TO: for that
user.. if Hotmail says no, then the sender verify has failed, and Postfix is
rejecting it.
Is someuser a valid account on Hotmail?

I'm more a lurker, try to post helpful bits when I see an opportunity here,
but this is a Linux mailing list.
Can we keep the discussion related to Linux?
ReactOS is their own community, bring this discussion to their forums

First, whatever registration requirement you decide on, how do you plan
to verify it? For example, I have a PSU student ID card, a pdx.edu
e-mail account, and an ODIN account, yet I am not registered for any
courses at all this (summer) term.

Second, Portland State is an urban university. Its enrollment is 32%
graduate students, who mostly take only one or two courses at a time
because they have full time jobs. And that goes for about half the
undergraduates as well. The average undergraduate at PSU takes six
years to complete the degree.

Third, if you are taking a PE course at PSU it is probably because your
are a PE major, so it is a regular full course with the usual academic
rigor. 

I understand your intent; I merely wish to point out that enforcing it
by requiring that a person be currently registered for a particular
number of hours may be impractical. I would suggest that you use the
same standard as commercial software companies do when offering
academic prices for their software - which is just an ID card with a
student number.

Brent,

   That makes two of us.

   It's worse than that. While the sender has a hotmail (ugh!) address, it is
relayed through the MTA of the company with whom she contracts, and that is
a local ISP. Where comcast fits into all this I've no idea.

   All types. It turned out that when I looked carefully at what I had
installed based on Ralf's book I mis-used the rhsbl_sender_exceptions list.
Fixing that fixed the problem.

Thanks,

I talked it over with the LPC planning commitee, and they've agreed to
let part-time students attend the student day.  You just have to show
your university ID card at the door.  Thanks for bringing this subject up.
I hope to see you on September 16th!

In ascii art form:

Debian --{switch}-- Ubuntu--{modem}---{ISP}

How is your modem connecting to the ISP?  PPPoE?  Straight DHCP?
Static IP?  Something else?

What version of Ubuntu are you using?

Whomever it is your ISP has to assign you an IP address, gateway,
netmask, DNS, etc.  They'll either write it down for you or assign it
to you dynamically.

Regards,
- Robert

You want the Ubuntu box to NAT for you.  The ISP is assigning you one
IP address and that's all it know about.  So, you need an iptables
rule something like:

  iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE

if you don't already.

I'll be doing my "open source: a look forward, a look back" talk that got me a
keynote slot a few years ago in Brazil.  It's about how you can contribute to
open source no matter what your skill level, and even make money at this
stuff.

I'll keep it short so we can get to Jax quickly, and get the *real* meeting
started. :)

Can you elaborate on "has them". Is this in the sense that they are for sale
with linux pre-loaded or used systems for free?

Hello!

I am sorry I was at their web site a few days ago and noticed that they have a 
Lenovo 8934FAU. I made the assumption that this was an IBM Thinkpad.

So I am so stupid I should not be allowed to live. Just thought I would help 
and since I have used these people for over 10 years for all my Linux stuff I 
wrongly made the assumption I knew something.

I got mine at Computek, 1615 SW Jefferson, Portland, 503-274-4384. They
are an authorized Lenovo dealer. Most of the Thinkpads they sell are
custom orders for local businesses, but they do keep a few in stock.
Unlike big box stores, they know Thinkpads, as that is about all they
sell. They are a small outfit, but have been in business in Portland
for at least a decade. They specialize in selling to businesses that
need special high end computers that are also reliable. When I was
buying my T61 the salesperson knew all the options it had, what
hardware was inside, what I could get instead if I custom ordered a
Thinkpad, and even how long different options would take to arrive.
When I said that its stock 1 GB RAM was not enough he said he could add
whatever I wanted up to its max of 4 GB. I opted for 2 GB and he just
did it while I waited.

Their salesmanship is somewhat aloof, but it's a pleasure to buy from a
salesperson who knows the product. And before buying the T61 from them
I priced it on Lenovo's site, and the Lenovo online price was only a
few dollars cheaper than Computek's price.

I bought it on a Saturday and just left it in the box because the next
day was a Clinic. I opened the box at the Clinic and we baptized it
into the world of Linux and OSS.

I remembered that, vaguely, and dug up the old email and called them.
They couldn't tell me what they could get overnight, but asked me to
figure out what I wanted and they'd tell me if he could get it.  We
ended up punting and ordered one from lenovo.  Probably three weeks
away, but we decided we could wait.

Interestingly, as we were working on ordering (lenovo's website is
dumb), the old Compaq Presario came back to life spontaneously.  I
think there may be a problem with the charger.  It seems to need a
charged battery in order to boot up.  I think maybe sitting there, it
recovered enough of a charge to work.  The batteries (we have a spare)
are something like 8 years old and pretty well shot.

Thanks all for your feedback.  I appreciate it, even if I didn't end
up using any of it.

I have a Compaq Presario R3240 - dead, bad hard drive connector on the
motherboard. But I have a couple of batteries for it that are still
functional. Yell if they'll help.

Well I gave up on the bluetooth headset idea since it was becoming a 
time gobbler.  Too many little things to fiddle around with right now.

So I'm now looking for suggestions/experience with USB connected 
headsets -- microphone and headphone combination.  I get the feeling 
most will just work as there is very little current info when I search 
using Google.

I'll be using it on a CentOS 5.2 system with Audacity and ZoIPer 
(softphone).

Any suggestions or recommendations?


Thanks,

Yep.  The USB sound standard seems to have gotten something right.

I have a logitech a-0374a, which is fine for sound quality (the 
microphone is particularly fine), but I'm always afraid I'll yank the 
thinner wire out of the set given the way the heavier usb cable 
terminates at a clip 24" from my ear -- I guess that goes on your belt 
if you wear your pants real high, but I never know what to do with the 
silly thing.  And apparently the volume buttons don't work.   The mute 
button is ok.  Said buttons are found on the aforementioned silly clip 
and therefore contribute to the weight of the usb cable which is 
pulling on the skinny $30 part of the cable :-/

I have a Plantronics USB "Gamers" headset (GameCom Pro 1). Quoth
the /usr/sbin/lsusb:

Bus 002 Device 004: ID 047f:0ca1 Plantronics, Inc. USB DSP v4 Audio

Works fine in Skype on Gentoo; there are some tricks about module
ordering and config files for most other apps, but Skype is smarter than
most other apps. :-)

I love my bluetooth headset, which works flawlessly on my Hardy x86_64
computer. Once it is bonded, all you have to do is remember to turn on
the headset before launching the program that will be sending sound to
it.

What kind of problems were you having with bluetooth headsets?

Being a little cheap I tried using a USB connected bluetooth dongle and 
a bluetooth connected ear-piece (the cell phone type).

Bluetooth-wise they would pair up but I couldn't get ALSA to recognize 
the ear-piece.  This all from a couple of months ago so my memory is 
fuzzy as to what all I tried.

I wanted a bluetooth headset merely because I hate cables. I was always
coming close to hanging myself with them. Suddenly ripping the headset
off my head as I inadvertently snagged one of the cables was also not
amusing.

I wanted a headset that was of professional audiophile quality. I
wasn't concerned with the phone at all. I'm not very popular, so no one
calls me anyway. I bought the Sony BT50 headset on Amazon and they work
fine with the bluetooth in my Thinkpad T61. I also got an after-market
device that plugs into my iPod so it can transmit via bluetooth. It
works great with the BT50 headset too. Now I can sit and listen to
symphonies from my computer, or listen to them from my iPod while
hiking.

I also bought a bluetooth device that supposedly allows you to transmit
via bluetooth from your computer to a home audio system. It has
standard RCA plugs that go into an AUX input on the amplifier. It
works, but the sound is strangely distorted. 

Having said all of that, I discovered one small problem using the
computer and the headset. The headset works fine with all programs
except Realplayer. My dim understanding is that it is because
Realplayer does not use ALSA. I tried a number of things - including a
utility that is supposed to convert, but nothing has worked.
Unfortunately, some streaming radio stations do not work in open source
alternatives to Realplayer. I mention this only because you mentioned
having problems getting ALSA to recognize the earpiece. It could be
that my problem with OSS is related.

a potential workaround for naughty audio apps is to use them via
esddsp or artsdsp if you can run the enlightened sound daemon (from
the gnome folks) or kde's sound daemon arts.  i used that to make some
software behave better (specifically, the !@#$ flash plugin that liked
to hang my whole browser if the audio devices were in use).

the wrapper programs (artsdsp or esddsp) did some magic to reroute
sound device interaction via arts or esound--not sure how well it
would work if the program actually doesn't go via the sound drivers at
all--but if it just uses OSS instead of ALSA, there's probably a
decent chance, worth trying anyway.

I'll be capturing audio/video (HV20 + shotgun mike -> miniDV tape),
open to suggestions on where to post it (can also extract audio to
stand-alone mp3 file)...

Was going to assist Randal's live-cast, but he needs his laptop for
presentation and I don't want to be running errands all afternoon with
my desktop computer in my backseat (visiting from Salem).

Maybe Randal will also record audio on his nifty little zoom?

Subject: [PLUG] Reading HPFS/NTFS drive
Message-ID: <489C79C1.9080207@comcast.net>

My brother-in-law sent me a used computer. There's something wrong with
the box because it won't boot, or even get as far as the BIOS. I'm
trying to discover what parts I can use.

As far as I know, he's never used Linux, so I expect the drive to have
some M$ file system on it. I installed it in my USB enclosure and
connected it to my Linux machine. I get a Konqueror window that tells me
that it was mounted on media:/sda1/. It has one directory named "System
Volume Information" and inside that are two objects, one named
"MountPointManagerRemoteDatabase" which Konqueror says is an empty
document, and a binary file named "tracking.log" which Konqueror says is
20.0 KB. I know it to be a binary from trying to look at it with
Konqueror and being told that it is a binary file, and that I would
corrupt it if I saved it.

Should I be able to see more than that?

The partitioner in YaST says:

Device     Size     F  Type            Start  End      Device ID
/dev/sda   28.6 GB     Maxtor 6-E030LO        3637    usb-Maxtor_6_E030LO_0
/dev/sda1  28.6 GB     HPFS/NTFS           0  3736   
usb-Maxtor_6_E030LO_0-part1

In the long run, it doesn't matter to me if I can read anything on that
drive or not. I'm just curious to know more about the drive before I
install Ubuntu on it.

Might I suggest booting with knoppix, just because it is all set up to
be able to mount NTFS patitions (kernel support, etc).  I have used
knoppix to rescue data from winblows boxes more than once, and it is
always a breeze to mount and read.

Or make sure you have NTFS support in your running kernel.  The module
is called ntfs, according to my kernel docs.

If there really is a winblows load on sda1, you should see a lot more
than System Volume Information.  Maybe you are seeing accurate
information if someone tried to delete everything from within winblows.

Or just reformat the drive with a suitable linux filesystem (like ext3)
and run badblocks on it, if all you care about is verifying the
usability of the drive.

Richard and all:
I don't have anything to offer in the way of help, sorry. But I am 
curious about something and wonder if someone can help me understand.
As I understand it, files that are compiled / assembled are usually 
referred to as "binary" (for some reason that makes no sense to me). 
Maybe a misnomer that has stuck?

I wonder if Konqueror is unable to interpret files in the file systems 
and therefore tags it as a "binary" file. I also wouldn't expect a log 
file to be a "binary" - unless binary has other meanings in other contexts.

Binary files are just plain files.  There is no concept of lines.
Such a concept only has meaning when dealing with text that a human
can read (stories, source code, log files).  Even if a file contains
only ASCII characters, it is not necessarily a text file.  A
BASE64-encoded MIME attachments is ASCII, but it is not
human-readable, and has no end of line markers.  Also consider an
ASCII-encoded GPG key.

Some binary files (files without line demarcations) are used to store
natively executable code, or executable bytecode.  These are
executable binaries.  There are also executable text files, which are
ASCII files, containing human-readable text (and lines!), the contents
of which happen to be parseable and interpretable by some language
engine, like perl or bash.

I will hang it out there and make a guess that binary files are called
that for this reason: the contents are interesting at a bit-wide
level.  It is fun to observe the bit patterns in machine code words,
and doing so will shed much light on why the various codes have the
values they do.  Compression works at the bit level, and the resulting
files need to convey that.  Bitmaps are an obvious, self-explanatory
example.

Many programs (konqueror may or may not be one of these, but I suspect
it is) use MIME mappings to decide what type of data a file contains.
This just means that it uses the filename extension as its one and
only clue.  You can go into such programs and change the MIME mappings
if you want; it's just a dumb hash table.  On the other hand, the
"file" command line program actually looks at the file header.

Subject: [PLUG] why does this 553 error occur when I send mail
Message-ID: <1218305545.13342.11.camel@localhost>


I got to mention Joomla/VirtueMart but my mail is really about email
operation.

Joomla is a CMS and VirtueMart is an e-commerce package for it. There's
a bunch of email that goes back and forth when a customer buys stuff.

When a customer buys a product, VirtueMart sends the customer a
confirmation email. It sends this email to the email address that the
customer registered with. This works fine. 

Virtuemart then also sends an email to the store. You configure the
store's email, which in my case is a gmail account. When I look at the
mail received by that account, I see that it is from the email address
that the customer registered with. This sometimes works and sometimes
does not. 

When it does not work, the error message is 
"553 sorry, your mail was administratively denied. (#5.7.1)"
This error message is sent to the customer's email address.

It is dependent on what the customer's email address is. I have two test
customers. They are both me with different names. They are identical
except for their email addresses. For one customer (whose email address
is from a DSL provider), everything works. For the other customer (whose
email address is from a cable provider), it fails with that 553 error. I
have both DSL and cable providers.

If I use an email client (Evolution) I can mail from the customer's
cable address (which is my own cable email address) to the store's email
address (which is a gmail address).

I've talked to both my hoster (godaddy) and my ISP (comcast) and neither
is able to help. And I've posted on the VirtueMart forum with more
questions about the internals of VirtueMart in that post. But I don't
think it's a VirtueMart problem ... I think it's something that comcast
is doing.

And so I'm looking at ways to modify the PHP code that does the sending
(PHPmailer is included with VirtueMart) to workaround the problem, but
this is difficult because I don't know why I see this problem and hence
where I should look.

One cheeseball method I have used in the past with PHP is to add the -f
switch to the mail() function call.  This sets the sender address to be the
same as the recipient address.  This makes the mail server think that the
recipient is sending a mail to themself.  See if you find that PHPMailer
is, at the bottom of it all, using the standard mail() function, and try
the -f switch just for fun.  This will determine if the gmail mail
server is rejecting you solely based on the sender address.

http://devzone.zend.com/manual/function.mail.html

Set the -f switch in the additional_parameters argument of the mail()
function (the fifth argument).  This will pass the -f to sendmail.

Is the email being sent in plaintext?  You could packet-trace the two
emails and look for any differences.  By "the two emails", I mean the
Evolution-sent one vs. the webapp-sent one.  Or there's always the old
telnet email connection.  You can use a perl one-liner to generate the
AUTH string.  We can dig that up if it gets to that point.

One option would be to get the gmail mail server out of the picture: set
up your own mail server.  But then you'll start seeing the problems I
see, where I cannot send mail to customers who have yahoo accounts
because yahoo rejects emails sent from my non-isp domain name.  You
can't win in this new regime of spammers on one side, anti-spam paranoids
on the other.  But you'd think that godaddy.com would be an accepted
domain.

Thanks much Carlos. Good suggestions. In the meantime I came across a
VirtueMart enhancement request on the VM dev list that has been
implemented and that if I unimplement looks as if it might fix the
problem.

https://dev.virtuemart.net/cb/issue/2165 

It seems someone wanted the from address in the store notification to be
the customer so that whoever read the store's mail could easily reply. 

This does not sound like a good enhancement to me (and the comments on
the enhancement agree with me) but nonetheless it was implemented.

It could be that something like SPF or DomainKeys is getting in the way.
When the store sends emails "as" the customer, this is essentially the same
as when a spammer spoofs someone else's email address. That scenario is
exactly what those two countermeasures were invented to combat. That would
explain why the results vary by domain; if the owner/operator of a given
domain does not implement spoofing countermeasures, the spoofed emails get
through unchallenged.

This also explains why the email works fine coming from Evolution; it's
(presumably) being sent out via comcast's mail server, while the email from
the ecommerce webapp is being sent out via the mail server at the same
location as the webapp is running.

I think you guys have nailed the problem. Unimplementing the 2165
enhancement (which is one line of code) has the same effect as the -f
switch Carlos described. Yes, when it works from Evolution I am
connected to comcast and use their mail server.

Message-ID: <489FB9D0.70001@dslnorthwest.net>

While browsing, a message appeared, unannounced, uninvited, and persistent.  I
mentioned this once before on this board, but was not quick enough to capture
the details.  Now I have details.

The first window to appear:

The page at http://performanceoptimizer.com says:
NOTICE: Errors in you PC can cause data loss, hardware or software failure and
performance fall.
Install PerformanceOptimizer to fix errors, monitor changes and maintain PC
stability!

And so it goes through 3 windows.

To the best of my knowledge I did not click on anything in the page I was 
viewing.  Are these windows the result of Java script or Java?  Closing Firefox 
seems to be the best way to get rid of them, but that is a pita.

I did have a number of cookies from PerformanceOptimizer--I just deleted them. 
And I prohibited cookies from http://performanceoptimizer.com.  Will it put an 
end to this?

Is the site I am visiting when these windows show up responsible?

I have done some searching for this, but almost all hits deal with Windows, and 
are mostly old.

Any information would be appreciated.

Thanks,
-Denis

Poorly focused and taken quickly, (and I scrubbed the filenames out,

I'd suggest installing either Noscript or Yesscript addons for Firefox.
Also, try Adblock Plus addon for Firefox.
Sounds like it was probably a javascript popup or some such.
What I suggested would disable those.

My server's IP address somehow got on Yahoo's black list, and they
are running me through an incredibly bureaucratic process to get 
off of it.  I do run 5 low volume mailing lists ( 351 subscribers,
6 on yahoo ), perhaps they don't like that, or else they don't

sending more forms and just get me off the black list.

Oh well, if they keep it up, I suppose I will consider the 200 spams
a day their servers throw at me as a reason to talk to my lawyer.

Subject: [PLUG] Need new e-mail account
Message-ID: <20080813223941.112fa1eb.johnxj@comcast.net>

For years I have used a free e-mail account at Hotpop.com for most of
my e-list activity (but not for PLUG). For the past several days I have
been unable to access my mail with Sylpheed, which normally accesses
the Hotpop account without problem. I can log in via the web and I see
183 messages. Unfortunately, Hotpop's web interface does not allow
reading mail in a browser - you have to download it with a mail client. 

This is not the first time Hotpop has done this to me. Now, since all
the messages in the inbox are either from an e-list (which are archived
online anyway), or are spam, I just deleted them all. Then I canceled
the Hotpop account. 

So now I am shopping for a replacement free e-mail account. I started
with Gmail, but I can't get it configured so that Sylpheed can download
messages. There are a lot of specific requirements and I must have one
of them off. I got it to the point where Sylpheed goes to the Gmail
account, but the GUI window then hangs. Sylpheed has a log utility so
you can see what kind of messages you are getting. When I try to
download messages I get 

* Connecting to POP3 server: pop.gmail.com...
* Incorporation cancelled

Does anyone know what incorporation is?

An additional fact: When I am at PSU I cannot send e-mail unless I send
it through mailhost at pdx.edu using my pdx.edu account. This works OK,
and it works even from home. Hence, I have always configured my e-mail
accounts in Sylpheed to download from the account's pop server, but to
send via mailhost at pdx.edu. Comcast doesn't seem to mind, and Hotpop
didn't either. On the hunch that this might be what is screwing up my
Gmail account I changed it to use smtp.gmail.com and to use my Gmail
username and password. However, that doesn't work either. I can't send
from the Gmail account any better than I can receive.

Any suggestions welcome, including suggestions for a different free
account.

How about running your own mail server?

If you connect to the Internet via DSL, fiber optics, or
ISDN, you can do this no problem as long as you have an IP
block.  The IP block can be one IP address ;-)  I 
recommend Postfix for this and I strongly recommend setting
up a mail gateway between you and the Net that only accepts
email for the addresses you serve.  This mail gateway should
minimally use the bl.spamcop.net and dnsbl.sorbs.net blacklists
to reduce spam influx.  I also recommend setting up sqlgrey on
your mail gateway which will give you greylisting.  Look up
razor and set up spamassassin.

I'm assuming that you want an email address for private 
personal use.  Do it yourself email gives you control
and privacy.

BTW, I suggest learning about domain keys even though it's
something I don't know anything about as it is apparently
quite useful in the fight against spam.

If I'm totally off on this one, why do you want a publicly
hosted email account via a third party?

*Unless* you have an intense desire to understand how email systems
work, I suggest leaving that up to someone else.  It's pretty easy to
set up a server that will send/receive your test messages, but it is
significantly more difficult to keep it working properly, spam-free
(where "spam-free" is defined by gmail's spam filtering performance,
or some similar level of quality), safe, and functional.

It's very easy to learn just enough to do damage. (I've fallen into
the trap of thinking "oh, it'll be easy...." and 6 months later lost
all email access because I didn't have backup MX records set properly,
and my UPS battery died, then later the cable modem was down for a
week, and finally my fans seized and the processors caught on fire
while I was gone.. $4!7 happens, and when it happens to your mail
server, you can loose important things...)

If you really want to, and since you're not using this address for
critical email, you could certainly go this route.  I just want to
warn you: it's not trivial.

My suggestion is to use the gmail web interface.  I didn't like it
much in the beginning, but it has grown on me, and the search features
are much better than anything I've found in desktop email clients.

Would you be willing to try IMAP instead of POP?  That way messages
stay synced between gmail and your client.

Did you enable POP support on gmail? It's not by default, as is IMAP. 
You also need SSL enabled for incoming and outgoing and use the correct 
ports.

You need to setup your username and password for outgoing too. Look at 
the setup on the gmail help pages for Thunderbird. It probably has all 
the info you need for Sylpheed.

Thanks for all the suggestions. I finally got it working.

The problem was Sylpheed's GUI - confusing. The settings are all on
tabs, but which options are on which tabs are not grouped very
logically. There is a tab for Send and a tab for Receive, plus a tab
for Basic. The username and password for receiving are on Basic tab,
not the Receive tab. The Send tab does have a separate box for username
and password, but you have to specify the send address on the Basic
tab.

Dear John, 

One intermediate option is to use your own domain - and have it hosted
by a third party. Such options can be fairly inexpensive - I have 500MB
of space from Brainhosting for this mommabears.com domain. I use it
mostly for experiments and email for $18/yr, along with $7/yr for the
domain. 

While it doesn't require you to run your own mail server, it does
require you to understand DNS forwarding. It has its own URL for sending
and receiving email as well.

Then you can set up as many email accounts as you need - including
dedicated accounts for mailing lists, junk, etc. 

Thanks, 
Mike

I would just like to add that Gmail offers this functionality as well, for
free.

I am using it at this moment to write this email, as well as receive emails
on my domain.

I can't imagine ever needing more than the three accounts I have - my
Comcast account, my business account, and the Gmail throwaway account. 

I realize there are people here who can't understand someone not
needing dozens of e-mail accounts, but that's not me. Nor do I have
time right now to learn all about how e-mail works.

On the other hand y'all can come down to the Clinic this Sunday and
wail on me for not being interested in knowing everything about e-mail. 

So thanks for the suggestions, but I have everything working that I
need. Someday I may revisit the issue with a desire to learn the inner
workings of mail servers and stuff.

I think the point Wes was trying to make was that for free (registration 
fees for the domain aside), you can have yourdomain.com with Google Apps 
for Domains hosting the site and your email for no cost. It's not about 
having dozens of accounts all over the place.

Here's the thing about email accounts. Many are not portable. Gmail (et 
al) is, but your Comcast isn't. If you move to DSL or to an area Comcast 
doesn't service, then you will lose the Comcast email account. By owning 
your own domain, your email addresses are not based on your ISP. You 
could move to another country and always keep your email addresses. For 
some, this isn't important. For others, keeping the same email address 
forever is.

Setting this up with Google is slightly more difficult than registering 
the domain. You get the benefits of not learning about mail servers, 
having google's excellent spam filtering and storage, email addresses 
that stay for as long as you want, for very little cost.

I understand the problem with portability. But that is not a problem
for me. If I switch from Comcast I just have to go to the PLUG website
and register my new e-mail address. Ditto for half a dozen other
e-lists and accounts that I use Comcast for. It would take me less than
half an hour to do this. 

Besides, I have changed ISPs only once in the past ten years. Plus, I
don't have a lot of accounts. I'm not a very important person. 

Moreoever, I have a new device for communicating with people in real
time that I have found is far better than e-mail. It's called a "telephone."

Consider yourself lucky, I've had to change ISP several times over the past
few years, and many of those times it was not by choice, the cable company
(or the rights to the region we were in) was being bought and sold like a
hot potato.  This was back at my folk's house.  First we had a few small DSL
providers, PhoenixDSL was one (long gone now, email was @phoenixdsl.com or
something), and maybe one or two others, then we got cable, which was
through a local company MediaOne cable (email @mediaone.net)... they got
bought out by AT&T, so our emails again changed (@attbi.com), then they sold
this local portion of the county to Time Warner, so again our emails changed
(@socal.rr.com).  Needless to say I got rather sick of it and sometime
around there is when I got Gmail (it was just coming out of "alpha" by
then).  Also when I moved out we got DSL in So Cal (DSL Extreme), then we
moved up here (Portland), and we have Verizon DSL now.

After this discussion, I decided to try and see how easy it was to setup my
own domain email through Gmail, and lo and behold it is done, and it was
rather painless.  So now I can go to mail.mydomain.net, and sign in to a
custom Gmail site.  I can also setup IMAP or POP and check my own domain
email with Thunderbird or any regular email client.  Very spiffy.

What, you mean like those things they sell in the mall, with the MP3 player
and camera and GPS navigation and Tetris and TV feeds and mobile web
browser.... you mean there is an actual phone in there somewhere?? ;)  Or
are you talking about one of those old fashioned things with the wooden
cabinet and the circular crank, you pickup the earpiece cone and shout into
the mouthpiece cone?  ;)

Heh. When I was a boy, all we had was a brass lever and fulcrum
arrangement connected to a pair of wires. We had to tap out our messages
in a language named after some high tech wizard -- Morse, I think his
name was.

But my grandpa had it worse. When he wanted to send a message to
someone, he had to build a fire, throw on some wet wood, and then
alternately cover and uncover the fire with a blanket!

We still do that here when the 'net goes down -- the only difference
is that instead of stocking the fire with wood, we just pull the fans
off of a couple of P3's ;)

To get slightly back on topic --

John et al. can often get the benefit of multiple email accounts
(improved filtering) with gmail by appending unique strings to your
gmail user name when you give out your email address.  eg; if your
email address is jjj at gmail.com, then you can send email to
jjj+<anything>@gmail.com and it will show up in your in box.

You can then easily filter on the TO: field to keep emails separate.
For example, when I register at a website I don't fully trust, I'll
use a variation of my email address (eg: creswick+foo at gmail.com) and
then set up gmail to label all email to that address.  If the address
gets sold to spammers, then it's trivial to auto-archive or
auto-delete everything that comes to that address.

   And now that we've learned how, they keep multiplying and making our

On a slightly skewed note, when picking a mail account, please 
avoid Yahoo mail.  After many hours of gathering data and filling
out stupid forms, the supportclown at Yahoo decided to continue
throwing out the personal mail I send to my friends who happen 
to be Yahoo subscribers.  So if you have a Yahoo mail account,
I probably can't send email to you.  While you may consider that
a blessing :-), it also means that other people that run their
own small servers may not be able to send email to you as well.

Oh well.  Time to use my seldom touched emergency gmail account
to tell friends and relatives currently on Yahoo to also get
gmail accounts so I can continue to communicate with them.
Strangely, mail to Yahoo groups still works.

   My sister and a friend of mine have yahoo mail accounts. Neither will
consider changing. They send and receive mail to/from me without blockage.
Regardless, I'm not a fan of yahoo or hotmail. Wish I could block both at
the MTA level.

Well now ... despite the rumors that I'm older than dirt, that's not
true -- my first job was in my father's dirt factory.

Title: Creating CPAN Modules with SWIG
 
Abstract:
This talk will assume a basic familiarity with Perl and C syntax and
go through the process of creating a CPAN module which uses the
Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator (SWIG) to make an interface
to an existing C library. To be used as a "live" example is Math::GSL,
a Perl module which is part of the Google Summer of Code 2008 
and provides an interface to the GNU Scientific Library.

Message-ID: <1219083362.21243.9.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Anyone know why the 64 bit version is under a non gpl license?

What is menuetos all about?  I found out about it googling for
information on ReactOS.  I honestly don't see the need to program
at the assembly level, C with today's optimizing compilers is
mostly portable and good enough.

I think Linux even has a bigger app base than MenuetOS.  ReactOS
makes more sense to me if it's promise is ever fully realized.
Wine will never support Windows drivers and there are many apps
that are either a not fast enough or b nonfunctional.

One thing I wonder about with ReactOS, how is security done right
going to feel like Windows?  Supposedly NT allows an object model
with highly definable permissions, yet most people run as 
administrator.

Hi Michael,

Which drivers are you having trouble with?  Did you check the Wine 
hardware compatibility list?

Perhaps posting the output of lsusb and other details about the hardware 
would help us to help you solve your problem.

Message-ID: <c834ec80808181404y40c07f7p18c0101ee0397852@mail.gmail.com>

I ran into an odd emacs feature the other day, and I'm not really sure
how to figure out what it is, or ... well, anything about it.  It's
likely new in emacs v23, so YMMV if you try it.  Cutting to the chase,
you can highlight content in a buffer in a more or less persistent way
by doing a funny little dance with the mouse and meta:

   * Click and drag a selection with the mouse, but don't release the
mouse button.
   * Press and hold Meta
   * Release the mouse button
   * Release Meta.
   * Ooh and Ahh over the selection that is now in yellow (at least,
it's yellow for me.)

Once you've finished oogling, you can either spend the next 30 min.
trying to get rid of that annoying yellow patch you just created, or
you can just repeat the above process minus the dragging.  (Press the
mouse button, press meta, release mouse, release meta).

Does anyone grok this thing? Is it really just a way to draw attention
to a portion of text? What is it called? (The built-in help features
aren't doing me any good here, since it's not exactly a single,
unambiguous, key binding, and it's obviously not the same as the
selection or point & mark.)

(This is not it, but it's also cool:

It's a new feature with emacs23, called something like discontiguous
region selection.  I read about it, somewhere, when I upgraded emacs,
tried it out, thought that it was pretty nifty, but haven't used it
since.  And I can't find the spot where I first read about it now.

Ali,

   And what does one do with it that cannot be done with contiguous region
selection?

Your mail log is a good place to start. You should be able to see the 
expected sequence of events for the primary user then compare it what 
occurred for the other user.

You might also check to see if there are different user preferences 
specified in each user's $HOME/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.

It appears that it is NOT a user issue, that was coincidental.  My 
local.cf file set required_score at 2.9 but spamchk set it at 3.0. 
Apparently, spamchk overrides local.cf.  Does that make sense?

Sure. I've never used spamchk, but overriding local.cf is a long and 
honored tradition! :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Can't get samba working...
Message-ID: <20080819171818.ww7cod5q8w04g4ow@web.robinson-west.com>

I have a windows 2000 pro virtual machine running on top of
my Fedora Core 9 system via vmware player in host only mode.
I want to share the HP Deskjet 9800 printer.  I'm trying to
set up samba to do this, but it isn't working.  The following
is what I have so far:

[global]
         workgroup = HOME
         server string = %h server (Samba, Fedora Core 9)
         wins support = yes
         interfaces = lo, eth0, vmnet8, vmnet1
         bind interfaces only = yes
         log file = /var/log/samba/%m.log
         socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192
         hostname lookups = yes
         dns proxy = no
         obey pam restrictions = yes

         load printers = yes
         printing = cups
         printcap name = cups

[printers]
         comment = All Printers
         path = /var/spool/samba
         browseable = no
         public = yes
         guest ok = yes
         writable = no
         printable = yes

[print$]
         comment = Printer Drivers
         path = /etc/samba/drivers
         browseable = yes
         guest ok = no
         read only = yes
         write list = root

for smb.conf.

I get access denied, unable to connect under W2K pro.  Where do the
print drivers go for automatic installation and where do I get them
from?  Supposedly, the print$ share is supposed to export the
drivers.  I'm running samba-3.2.0-2.17.fc9.i386 on my system.
I think swat needs a major overhaul and improved cups integration.

The printer works under cups on the Linux side.

I had to turn off SELinux and the firewall to get connections on a
CentOS5 Samba server. Maybe that's a place to start?

I'm on a Fedora Core 9 system that is fully updated.  According to

My troubleshooting steps would be

  1. Ensure cups is running: /sbin/service cups status

  2. Check the logs, probably in /var/log/cups.

  3. http://localhost:631/ -- make sure printers are defined, etc.

  4. strace -o /tmp/lp.trace lp /etc/samba/smb.conf, then examine
     the trace log you just wrote to /tmp for indications of where
     the failure occurred

The printers are defined, I can print a test page okay.

The strace doesn't make any sense.

Do you have an AuthInfoRequired directive in /etc/cups/printers.conf? 
If so, you'll want to remove it and then restart cups.

Message-ID: <48AC865A.1000400@acm.org>

I have several machines that run headless or connected to a KVM and the 
colo.  I'm adding more and will be running out of ports on the KVM.

Is there any kind of an adapter to let me use a laptop as the video, 
keyboard and mouse for another computer.  I've seen mention of network 
based KVM switches but would only need/want to connect to one system at 
a time.

That make any sense?  Turn a laptop into a monitor, keyboard, and mouse 
for another system.


TIA,

VNC (or NX) should do the trick--*if* you only need to work on working
systems ;).  Just run a vnc server on each machine you want to connect
to, and use a client on the laptop.  You can probably toss something
into /etc/hosts.deny on each machine to prevent anything other than
your laptop from connecting via vnc.

If you don't want to monkey with cables to get BIOS / etc. then you
could *probably* set up a serial console and interface with that from
the laptop as well, but that is bound to be at least a bit of work
(depending on the capabilities of the machines you need to work on).

Aside from serial, I don't know of any way to work on a broken machine
w/out a set of devices connected to it directly or via kvm.

VNC (or NX) should do the trick--*if* you only need to work on working
systems ;).  Just run a vnc server on each machine you want to connect
to, and use a client on the laptop.  You can probably toss something
into /etc/hosts.deny on each machine to prevent anything other than
your laptop from connecting via vnc.

If you don't want to monkey with cables to get BIOS / etc. then you
could *probably* set up a serial console and interface with that from
the laptop as well, but that is bound to be at least a bit of work
(depending on the capabilities of the machines you need to work on).

Aside from serial, I don't know of any way to work on a broken machine
w/out a set of devices connected to it directly or via kvm.

Yes, what you are asking makes perfect sense.  And I've been looking
for something like that for years without success.

If you find anything, please let the rest of us know about it.

Is the requirement to connect to a server while on site, or off site?
Does the requirement include GUI?

Well, a monitor, keyboard, and mouse could be plugged and unplugged from 
any system you want.  With the addition of some tape and possibly 
hinges they could even be made to resemble a laptop.

But it doesn't make much sense in the context of running out of ports on 
the kvm.  If you just want to graphically interface to them, but don't 
have anything to plug them into, you have to run a vnc server on the 
headless machine, which makes any sort of low-level task far too 
interesting because losing network or whatever means your vnc 
connection goes poof.

So, to get to the low-level functionality via the network as if you were 
sitting at the machine, you need some pricey hardware which is itself 
essentially a networked computer:

  http://www.realweasel.com/

There might be some other gizmos which you can plug into the K,V, and M 
ports but by the time you get a few of those, one of those fancy +8-way 
networked KVM gizmos starts to sound like a good deal.

Oh, just once?  Seems like there should be enough wires on the parallel 
port to pull that off in software, but perhaps a bit of a chip and usb 
would cleaner (and you might need enough active circuitry that any sort 
of software touching the vga and PS/2 pins directly would just make a 
mess of it all anyway.)

But I would think using one of your existing kvm's cables as a rogue 
would be the way to go if you can actually be bothered to mess with all 
of the business of dragging wires around inside the cabinet while being 
careful not to snap off an ethernet connector on any of the production 
servers.

Both Raritan and Avocent sell IP KVMs that use CAT5 as the interconnect and
are basically a glorified switch with a couple video adapters and a web
interface built in. The machines use a cat5 -> vga/usb or vga/ps2 dongles
that connect to the servers and pull power over PoE. While this does sound
all WHIZ-BANG! and all, their browser plugins to control the servers over
the network are buggy, and the DSView Software you need to take advantage of
the Avocent gear is not a trivial investment. I ended up scrapping both
raritan and avocent and just provisioning a VLAN for all the IPMI
controllers our servers had and used those for console level access.

Hello,

I'm thinking of biting on an iPhone since my Sprint plan is about up.

I've been (relatively) happy with my Palm Treo and it's ability to
synchronize with KDE's Kontact via bluetooth.  This setup allows me to daisy
chain via Kontact back to an ldap server where I've been keeping my contact
info for quite some time.

I've poked around a bit but haven't found any sites which talk folks through
synchronizing  their contact info between the iPhone and Linux platforms.
Anyone have any experience with this?

Thanks,

ben

You want that open source, or just "runs on Linux"?  The term "3D CAD" 
is also very ambiguous.  For what purpose?  Parametric and relational 
modeling, solids or surfaces, mechanical or architectural?

There is brlcad if you're hoping to model the ballistic penetration 
resistance of tank armor, blender if you want to make video game 
models, Pro-E if you want to write a big check, Varcon, etc.

Sorry I wasn't clearer before. He uses Solidworks to create 3D models of mechanical objects of production parts, including dimensions of the model. It does not need animation, nor does it need to calculate forces or anything. It would need to export the model in some industry-standard format to be sent to a manufacturer to build the part.

It does not have to be free or open source, though that is a big plus. "Runs on Linux" is the key in this situation.

VariCAD.  Has a free trial version that limits some functionality.

I sure wish AutoDesk would re-port AutoCAD to UNIX/Linux.  Heck I'd be 
happy with something from the Release 10-12 era.

I have not fiddled with it too much, yet, and I don't see how dimensions

Modeling to specific dimensions and dimensioning (for printing working 
drawings used in traditional fabrication) are different things.

But Art of Illusion seems to only do mesh modeling, which is fine for 
making STL files, but doesn't seem to have much in the way of 
parametric design.  VariCAD will probably be more suited to parts 
engineering.

gCAD3D might be worth a look.  The license is weird:  "freeware", "may 
be copied and distributed without restrictions"... ok, but can I change 
it?  kostenlos weitergegeben werden?

If index.php will never take any arguments, and assuming you're 
running Apache, this will work:

   RedirectMatch  gone  ^/index\.php\?.*$

The "gone" returns an HTTP 410 error, "indicated that the resource has 
been permanently removed." You can, however, return any numeric status 
code you want.

Why bother?  The key here is to have secure handling of the url
parameter.  Here are some approaches you should consider, in order, to
avoid path traversal issues:

1. Don't include any user-supplied values in filesystem paths.  If a
   dynamic path is needed on the backend, use an array as a lookup table
   and have the page accept only specific keys into that table.

2. If you *have* to include user-supplied values in filesystem paths
   (which is actually very rare, you should reconsider), then take the
   value, normalize it as a path using built-in path routines (don't
   remember what PHP has for this) and only then concatenate it with
   your path prefix.


If your concern here is about a third-party PHP app that you've
installed and aren't sure how it works under the hood... well you should
think about trying something else.  I make a living out of breaking into
websites and something about the PHP platform encourages insecure coding
practicies.  There are so many incredibly insecure open source PHP apps
out there that you'd have to spend a lot of time and effort vetting it.
Filtering URLs for specific types of evil on specific pages is a lost
cause.  Perhaps try a Python, Ruby or J2EE app.


good luck,
tim

passed URL with a PHP script, and now I don't pass anything at all 
between my web pages.  But apparently just using php for web pages is 
sort of like giving a monkey the keys to the banana plantation.  This 
guy just added ?url=../../etc. and seems to have gotten a good look at 
my password file. I don't think he has the actual encrypted passwords 
because I think they're supposed to be somewhere else, but exposing a 
valid list of user names is a lot more than I wanted to give out.

Every time I've gotten hacked it seems to have been through some hole 
I'd unknowingly left open in some neat new technology that sounded like 
a good idea at the time. Now I'm learning JavaScript; I can't wait to 
see how many holes the black hats find in that. I was planning on using 
a mix of PHP for the server side and JavaScript for the client side, but 
I don't know; maybe I should just post the root password in the title 
page and save time.

I don't want  to make a boring little html read-only web page. I'd like 
to use my server to its fullest potential and not be intimidated by the 
predators out there.  But there's no grace period for newbies anymore. 
Make one tiny mistake, and you're lunch. What also annoys me is that 
when you want to learn how to do something, and buy the forty-dollar, 
5-lb book from SAMS or WROX or whoever, it's usually already out of 
date, and they seldom supply you with details about all the millions of 
ways that the great software they're promoting can be compromised. No 
wonder there's brigade-sized bot-nets out there. It's so easy for the 
hackers to press-gang new machines!

Hackers are like mosquitoes; we'll never get rid of them, they'll suck 
you dry if they can, and I guess if you want to play on the 'net, you've 
got to expect to have to defend yourself. I suppose if somebody wrote a 
book on the many ways that systems can be hacked, it would just breed 
more kiddies and not enough newbies would read it before they got hacked.

Oh well, I suppose it's just one more brick in the wall... I guess I'll 
amend that redirect trick and block any attempt at using index.php with 
a '?' after it.

Thanks for the tip!

Yes, exactly.

Those books are already out there and you are right, far too few
programmers read into these things.  Consider checking out owasp.org for
some free secure programming advice.

It is possible to write a secure PHP app that does complicated things.
Don't get me wrong.  I was a PHP developer for a number of years.
The problem with it, as I see it, is that nearly every interface and API
built into the language is insecure by default... the easiest way to use
it is the unsafe way.  You have to put extra effort in to make it
secure, which means newbies invariably mess it up.  The plethora of
"helpful" suggestions by random users on the PHP manual websites doesn't
help either, since fully 2/3rds of them are complete crap.

Other platforms have a more secure-by-default mentality where the
easiest way to use an API also happens to be the secure way. 

If you're not an aspiring security nerd and don't want to have to learn
about every type of vulnerability under the sun, I strongly suggest
trying out other open source web development platforms.  Java/J2EE stuff
is a good way to go if you want to build a solid app and don't mind
taking your time doing it.  You'd definitely want to use a data
validation framework, such as struts, with this.

I personally use mod_python for quite a bit of stuff, but it's not the
easiest to get started with either since you probably will want to write
your own handler and page templating. 

Ruby on rails is popular, though I'm not very familiar with it.

Once again, that's just a bandaid.  Use it until you make your app
secure, but don't make a habit of it.

HTH,

Er... that's not the right solution.  You're trying to fix a leaky
boat by drinking the water -- your feet may be dry now, but it's not
going to end well.

If you are writing the php app, then you should make it so that such
an attack *is not possible*.  The application itself should deny this
sort of thing -- by *never* trusting anything that you cannot
guarantee came from your server. (URLs, form fields, user names,
passwords, etc... these are all very, very dangerous places to get
inputs.)

Please, please, please, don't write another app that is only remotely
safe if you follow a laundry list of steps that set up a "secure"
environment.  You will invariably miss something (it happens to us
all) and the next person to install your app will also miss something,
or type a regular expression into their .htaccess file wrong, or need
to modify it so that requests to their wordpress blog still work...
etc.  (and that person may be you -- you are going to do a full
reinstall when your box gets rooted, right?)

If you are not the application author, then use a different
application and report the bug!

Bill,

   Allow me to suggest that you look at established frameworks for web sites
that are based on scripting languages other than PHP. We're using Ruby on
Rails for one service, and I know there are a bunch of Python-based
frameworks with a lot of support and experience.

   With many of these, web- and maillist-based resources are much more
current than are the dead tree printed versions. For non-moving targets, the
latter are ideal, but for stuff that changes every week a more nimble
resource is called for.

All,

I have been looking over a web site

automatically loads it when I turn the computer on (I used the save and

some information including my IP address.

Google showed a lot of sites talking about vulnerabilities and scripts 
to test...but nothing told me what it is and why this happens two 
mornings in a row.


What is a test CGI?
Is this something I need to be worried about?

Thank you!

A Test CGI is usually a page that is used to determine if CGI handling for a
specific language is functioning. Like if you coded "<?php phptest(); ?> on
a page in a PHP environment it would generate a page with a byunch of debug
info and HTTP Headers that are visable to the server. I would doubt its
anything to worry about, its likely just left over from the server was being
setup.

That "something" would be the same "something" that Gimp and Photoshop 
have in encouraging bad design, that Word has in encouraging bad 
writing, and that Excel has in bad accounting practices....

For that matter, it's the very same "something" that a hammer has in 
common with bad building practices... people who aren't skilled in using 
a tool for a trade can, and will, often use it wrong (or poorly).

A tool which is readily available, accessible, and simple to use, tends 
to lead to mis-use in the wrong hands.

I suppose one can blame the tool *itself* for being used wrong, but it 
seems to me like that might be placing the blame poorly.

Of course, there are coding tools available which have lots of safety 
checks built in, but such tools are kinda like... hmmm... like hammers 
that don't allow you to swing them too fast, that require you to declare 
*exactly* where you are going to swing it, and at what target, and how 
hard, before you can even pick it up, and will fail to work at all 
unless you are wearing safety goggles and work gloves ahead of time.

For a seasoned building professional, such a hammer would be a serious 
annoyance to use. For somebody who is new to pounding nails, such a 
hammer might prevent them from injuring themselves, until they have 
enough experience to remove the "training wheels".

Sadly, what seems to have happened with PHP is that many people assumed 
that because they could swing a hammer, they then knew enough to build 
their own houses.

The question for Bill is whether he's looking for a web framework or a 
templating language.  The Catalyst framework is very mature, and built 
on top of secure code.

  http://www.catalystframework.org/

You can make a security hole with any programming language that has I/O, 
but Perl gives you a lot more tools for sanitizing user input, as well 
as syntax which allows you to treat a parameter as atomic rather than 
needing to meta-escape it (e.g. open, system, etc.)

Typically, if you're trying to change from php to any sort of framework, 
you'll find that things are done rather differently.  These tools tend 
to start with a config file (not just some code in a file which happens 
to be named "config"), a database, schema, and some templates.  
The "but I just want to ..." entry point isn't as easy to find as it is 
with php, but most of the developers have learned that any non-trivial 
application grows to the point where it needs these things -- which 
means that if you didn't start with them you end up with a buggy, 
ad-hoc reimplementation of them anyway.

If a framework is a lot to dive into and you're not trying to "engineer 
an application", maybe CGI::Simple is a good place to start.  
HTML::Mason gives you the template+language notion that php has, but 
that creates the same sort of mess that php does if you just set off on 
the path of creating a template with some embedded code.

I agree with your general premise that nerfing a tool to keep the kids
from hurting themselves also hinders the adults from getting things
done.  However, I'm not talking about using nerfed tools.

What I'm talking about is default behavior, and in the physical world,
there aren't many good analogies.  

Let me give an example: mandating prepared statements to send SQL
queries keeps users from *typically* shooting themselves in the foot.
This is because all dynamic arguments are automatically treated as data,
not SQL syntax.  Can users still shoot themselves in the foot if they
want to, and create SQL injection vulnerabilities?  Sure!  Just
dynamically construct the query and send it to the prepared statement
interface with no dynamic parameters.  This tends to be more work
though, so the typical newbie probably won't bother doing this.  The
most straight-forward way of getting the job done is the secure way.

The same goes for dynamic page templates.  Provide the user a templating
language which automatically HTML encodes dynamic parameters when
they're included in the page by *default*.  However, there should be a
way to override that behavior and explicitly say: "Hey, I want HTML to
be included here.  I've encoded things myself, trust me!"

Notice I didn't mention anything about input validation.  Far too many
programmers and even security professionals seem to think that input
validation is a panacea.  It isn't.  It is a good mitigation for a
number of vulnerabilities, but it also gets in the way of proper
application behavior in many cases and places business requirements at
odds with security.  Data encoding is almost always the correct answer
to preventing injection vulnerabilities and doesn't get in the way of
business requirements.

Hope that helps explain my position,
tim

I'm not terribly impressed with the "security features" of Ruby on
Rails. For the most part, they consist of warnings in the major books on
some simple things not to do. Moreover, I don't consider Ruby on Rails
"established" in any sense of the word. If you want "established",
you're going to end up in either LAMP, Java or Microsoft.

Security has nothing to do with the language or the framework. It's
something you have to design in from the ground floor and test
rigorously and constantly.

Hello Ed,

> Security has nothing to do with the language or the framework. 

I beg to differ.

How often do you see a Java application that's vulnerable to SQL
injection via a numeric field?  How often do you see a similar PHP
application be vulnerable to injection via a numeric field?  I'm sure
those numbers would differ, for the sole reason that Java is strictly
typed, and PHP isn't.  By nature, programmers will most often cast that
input parameter to an Integer in Java, just because that's the most
logical thing to do.

Strictly typed languages have their drawbacks, but this is just meant to
illustrate that language does matter when it comes to the security of
*typical, real-world* applications.

How often do you see Python applications vulnerable to remote file
include vulnerabilities?  How often with PHP?  Yeah... PHP basically
invented that class of vulnerability.  Complete and utter foolishness on
the PHP developers' part, but now we're stuck with it.

When it comes to real-world applications, the platform does matter
because most programmers suck.

Yes.

Regardless of the platform and language, you can always shoot yourself
in the foot.  I'm frequently amazed by how much work some programmers
will put into making their apps insecure.  Design security into your
apps, and test, test, test.

cheers,

One person's "mandat[ed] prepared statement" is another person's 
nerfing.... same thing goes for "nerfing" a language in such a way that 
it requires casting to specific data types (or requires variables to be 
initialized at all), or defaulting to a chroot (or similar) kind of 
jail, or enforces any kind of separation between display and logic (etc. 
etc.).

There are perfectly sane, and reasonable, arguments for doing such 
things, but philosophically, PHP went more in the direction of "making 
web programming easier for C developers", rather than "making dynamic 
web page content easier for HTML developers". Put another way, PHP 
generally *expected* a certain level of expertise, experience, and 
diligence on the part of software authors.

As an argument/example of the philosophical question, and approach the 
language took: "Should a server scripting language be able to simply 
read local files, or include files remotely from another server, without 
having to jump through a lot of hoops"? The default for PHP for a long 
time was to make such things easy for a programmer.

Of course, the counter argument to making this easy is noted in this 
very thread, as PHP was allowed to easily read /etc/passwd (it's a file 
on the hard disk, why shouldn't PHP be able to read it?...), and yet, 
there was an implied expectation that PHP "shouldn't be able to do 
that". Therin lies the rub, whether or not a feature like that is a 
desirable default behavior. ;)

Security in Rails apps is the responsibility of the programmer, who is
responsible for defining constraints. Rails provides easy-to-use tools
for implementing those constraints in a well-tested manner. 

Using multiple databases forces the Rails programmer to define queries
in a way that causes the framework to use a 'prepare' under the hood. If
you use only one some of the pressure is off and you can screw it up if
you want...

Absolutely true. 4 years is not long enough to be considered mature.
However, Rails has a smart and prolific following, and bugs are fixed
promptly. There have been no security patches to the latest stable Rails
release in the 3-4 months since it exited beta. That's not very long,
but consider that every previous release had a security release within a
week or two.

I disagree, and agree with previously presented arguments: the framework
can support good practices and make bad practices more difficult. That's
one of the things a framework should do for you: support good practices.

PHP (which I also use and like, in the right context) supports nothing
and impedes nothing; it is completely neutral. CakePHP (a Rails clone)
supports good practices and makes bad practices difficult, up to a
point. Many frameworks have accepted that mantle.

That's not really it.  If you do open(my $fh, '<', '/etc/passwd'), you 
get that.  If you're just trying to display some bit of text that's 
supposed to be next to you in the webroot, your tool (especially a very 
web-centric tool) should give you a default way to do that which limits 
the filenames to within the webroot.  That's not "nerf", it's more a 
matter of providing expressions which fit the context.  Given a 
function for "render this content as a part of my output", allowing
"this" to point at ../../etc/ is clearly (in this context) the "wrong 
thing" because our context says these things are supposed to be within 
a narrow set of locations which don't include /etc/.

In most languages, you could probably use a lower-level function to 
fetch data from /etc/passwd, but at that point, you're doing something 
different.  The framework should give you convenient tools for doing 
the sensible thing.  It can still give you plenty of rope, but handing 
me a neatly coiled rope is completely different from handing me a 
bucket full of knots.

Not to mix apples and oranges, but I don't see a lot of numeric fields 
on the web... it's almost all text/html. ;)

(Side note for those who don't get the code joke: html GET and POST is 
all text, so the typing/casting debate for web apps is really about how 
a programming language should *re-cast* input/output data, and/or handle 
internal variables.... okay, so maybe it's not that funny, as folks who 
*don't* know about this simple distinction are often the ones who are 
surprised when their "numeric" or "boolean" input field is used for an 
SQL injection string.)

A programmer used to the benefits of casting will do so, regardless of 
PHP or Java or perl or <whatever>.... a programmer who *doesn't* clean 
up their inputs can make that mistake regardless of the language. Where 
strongly/strictly-typed languages do add value/benefit is enforcing the 
most *minimal* discipline.....(Oblig xkcd: http://xkcd.com/327/ ). Of 
course, casting is a mere drop in the bucket of things to look at ('DROP 
TABLES' is a totally valid string... ;-) ), as there are boundary 
issues, race issues, privilege issues, yada yada....

The cost of, and choice of, languages can *influence* security, but I 
think this may be an argument that's more about the developers (and the 
languages they choose), rather than the languages (and the developers 
who choose them)... AKA "it's possible to write FORTRAN in any 
language". If a developer is numb/sloppy with respect to security 
issues, no language can magically fix that problem for them, and in the 
"real-world", there are a lot of different kinds of developers....

Python can't easily read local or remote files depending on dynamic 
input arguments? That's gotta hurt. ;)
(I kid... I hope. Can python really not do this?)

Where that "feature" really went south was people writing dynamic 
loaders without any forethought of what their input arguments needed to 
be restricted to. Those "dynamic loaders" got stuck in a lot of 
high-profile projects, and the rest is history.

I've seen less-than-ideal PHP/Java coders write the exact same problems 
into both languages. I've also seen a heck of a lot more bad public PHP 
code than Java code (putting aside the major DoS/memory issues that many 
Java apps seem to love). What I think makes a *huge* difference is the 
number of long term, professional, coders in various arenas, as compared 
to hobbyists and enthusiasts. PHP is where a lot of people seem to cut 
their web-app security teeth the hard way, where folks into Python, 
Ruby, Perl (etc.) tend to have a few more years of "making mistakes" 
under their belt.

Most of your responses up to this point in your last message seem to be
of the form "Well, it is still *possible*, regardless of
language/platform to write bad code".  Yes, I don't dispute this.  I've
seen Java developers fail to cast integer arguments and have them
inject.  The point is, if you actually sit down and test applications
like this on various platforms for a living, you'll find that some
platforms just have many fewer of these stupid mistakes.  I'm not
talking about theory, I'm talking about practice.

Including remote files as code is a dumb idea, regardless of language.
If you really had to do this in a distributed application environment,
you're better off using a network filesystem.

Of course Python can pull down a remote file and eval it in one of
several ways.  Making that kind of functionality a part of "import ..."
would be sheer idiocy.  Period.  Consider the principle of least
surprise (http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch11s01.html).

True, maybe there are just more bad programmers working on PHP apps.
Is that because it's so easy to learn, or because experienced
programmers realize it's an unsafe platform?

Domain Key from Yah-o-o is being absorbed into the IETF's DKIM standard. 
There is apparently a Perl module that can be added to postfix to
implement this on outbound email.  This is apparently a scheme to
sign emails with the OpenSSL private key so that a recipient MTA
can check it with the site's public key. 

There is a Perl module ( http://dkimproxy.sourceforge.net/ ) that
supposedly implements this.

Questions: (1) Is this worth the effort?  (2) Is it a security risk?
(3) is the dkimproxy module sound?  (4) can you use a self-signed
cert for this, or do you need an official ($$$) cert from places

These are good questions.

(3) At a glance, the Perl looks well written and appears to use solid 
CPAN modules to handle the crypto bits.  Not sure what possessed them 
to use autoconf or where exactly the supposed prefork is happening.

(1) As far as the DKIM protocol itself, it seems to be optimized toward 
selling processors, but maybe the hashing and signature checking is 
going to be faster than the amount work it currently takes to run 
spamassassin?

(4) As for buying yourself some "trust", the RFC might yield to a more 
careful reading, but seems to say the receiver MAY choose which certs 
to trust (and how), while at the same time saying that authority can be 
inferred via the DNS.

If you check your mail server logs, or spamassassin logs, I'm sure you'll
find a lot of spam nowadays has correct SPF records and even DKIM
signatures.
I see so much spam come through in fact, that I no longer subtract points
from spam using those systems. It may be you a bit more freedom to send to
the Yahoos and Hotmails of the world, but probably not a whole lot of other
systems.

If your webroot for the application is /etc/, because your particular  
application is a sysadmin application, /etc/passwd being read- 
accessible makes perfect sense.

There are many good arguments for many different PHP behaviors. :)

You somewhat lost me, but I would guess that the general debate  
focuses on the issue of whether PHP/perl/python/C/java/bash/ 
<whatever> should be limited to being a jailed "DocumentRoot"  
language, or a language that can inherit the permissions of a parent  
process.

Perhaps part of the "mental problem" is that people who deployed PHP  
on their servers did not realize how much power it had. This is not a  
new mistake, just an old one, repeated. If users should not be  
allowed C/bash/perl level scripting, then, well, shut off PHP?

Are you actually checking those signatures though?  Sure, it's trivial
to slap a DKIM header in there that can't be validated, but it's
obviously only useful in whitelisting if the signature is good and comes
from a key that can be reasonably trusted.

After some webmails started rejecting emails from me I set up citadel to 
use the perl dkimproxy. Took a few minutes to set up and it has been 
running solid for awhile now. Granted, there's not a lot of mail going 
out, but it's been working just fine. You don't need an official cert. 
When the mail is received and they are checking the domain keys, they 
just see if your email matches the key in your DNS entry.

Yes.  I would hope you were doing some authentication in that case.  But 
still, what I said is that you want a method for addressing filenames 
within the webroot which throws an error when handed an out-of-bounds 
filename.  If you actually set the webroot to /etc/ (though I wouldn't 
do this, even if it were a sysadmin app), well that isn't 
out-of-bounds, is it?

No.  That's the wrong debate.  One *could* have a framework (like the 
google appengine will supposedly be) which eliminates I/O methods from 
the language or replaces them with virtualized and managed code.  If 
you want to provide shared hosting to untrusted programmers, this is 
what you need to do.  Or you could use javascript on the server.  You 
still have a chance of leaking information.

But in general, the language itself doesn't need to jail you.  Rather, 
it (or a module/framework) should provide a good set of functions for 
doing the right thing.  In this case, the context is "web application", 
so your DTRT methods need to take the webroot and etc into account.  If 
the tool doesn't make it absolutely easy to do the right thing, it 
probably isn't the right tool.

In the PHP case, you have a lot of core language functions which are 
specifically designed for use in web applications, yet they all tend to 
place convenience over security (so much so that you would think this 
was some kind of templating language hacked together in an afternoon's 
worth of Perl.)  Having both would not be so difficult, but the 
language design doesn't go there.  It would have been simple to make 
the potentially insecure functionality require a bit of extra 
code/input (hey, just have yet another function with the 
prefix 'unsafe_' -- what's 400 more functions in the core syntax?), but 
what you got is the opposite:  extra coding will get you potentially 
secure functionality.

So, maybe the developers which PHP attracts would actually be better off 
with a javascript or otherwise jailed+stripped+managed framework?

Each platform seems to have its frequent failings, and benefits, in real 
world usage, yes.... ;)

Choices about given platforms will often reflect which benefits are 
desired, and which failings are considered marginally acceptable. To 
pick on my own stereotypes about the various stacks for a moment, Java 
stacks are great if you have absolutely unlimited budget and hardware 
resources, perl is fantastic if you never, ever, have to maintain or 
improve code of even slightly moderate complexity, Ruby/Rails (and 
similar conceptual "framework" stacks) are super-cool if you never need 
to do anything outside of the existing framework, and PHP is just spiffy 
if you don't mind regularly re-writing or upgrading other people's (or 
your own) first/second/third draft sloppy code...

Yes, these are my own grossly exaggerated generalizations, ones I 
learned the hard way from my own real world situations. There are 
exceptions. :) As with many stereotypes and prejudices, not being able 
to see past one's own biases and preconceptions can also be a real 
problem. ;)

As an argument, an include/import command that *doesn't*, oh, eval the 
code that was just imported seems totally silly, as I really don't see 
what would make sense about a C, PHP, (whatever) program having to 
include hundreds of header files, and than *also* having to eval those 
files in another, separate, step. I'm already including the code for 
pete's sake, why the heck should I have to first include *and* then eval it?

#include stdio.c
#eval stdio.c
?

It just seems absurd and nonsensical to me. If all somebody wanted to do 
in PHP was dump a file into output, fpassthru() does the trick, but 
forcing all includes/imports (or even just ones with specific contexts?) 
to run a separate, additional, step, just to acknowledge that the 
requested imported code/file is, indeed, *requested imported 
code/files*.... would seem to be a rather astonishing behavior.

Consider, for a second, the following meta-code, with the "convenience" 
of eval() added for giggles:

function SuperKewlLoader ($user_submitted_data_argument){
    $temp_blob = import ($user_submitted_data_argument);
    eval ($temp_blob);
}

I would argue that the underlying code problem under discussion *isn't* 
that the PHP import command is doing the wrong thing by, well, importing 
and evaluating code.

The way I see it, it really doesn't matter if the file is coming from a 
"bad user's" file on a local physical hard disk, a bad user file hosted 
via NFS or otherwise on on a SAN, or a bad user file fetched from 
halfway around the world via http/ftp/vpn 
tunnel/snail-mail/pigeons/whatever, the problem is that dirty 
user-submitted data is *intentionally* being allowed to control what 
code is being imported and executed. The argument could be a local disk 
file://home/eviluser/badness.php, a remote 
http://www.example.com/baduser.php, an uploaded /tmp/badness.php, a 
courier pigeon://african/swallow/badness.php, whatever.

As soon as a given software author decided that remote end-users could 
be allowed to submit their own arguments about what files/code were 
being imported and executed, the game was over. It doesn't matter if the 
underlying language is PHP, C, Java, Python, it's all the same result. 
Some languages and platforms may make it *harder* to do such a 
boneheaded thing ("I see you are trying to let the world access and 
execute any file on your disk, Cancel or Allow?"), but the fault there 
isn't really the language, it's with the user who clicks "Allow", or in 
this discussion, the programmer who *added* that (rather questionable) 
publicly available feature to their software.

I think PHP is easy enough to learn that people who have little to no 
long-term experience in making "the usual mistakes" can quickly pick it 
up, and once they get trained or otherwise used to avoiding typical 
mistakes, they will will seek out workflows and methods that enable 
avoiding those same mistakes.

In some cases, they'll avoid using PHP at all, and rely on other 
environments and workflows that attempt to remove those common mistakes. 
In other cases, they'll learn the kinds of PHP coding disciplines and 
techniques that avoid the mistakes... but in other cases, well, they'll 
just keep on making mistakes, and semi-patching with bad ideas and more 
mistakes, until their code is a nightmare of hacks, kludges, and endless 
exploit postings on bugtraq.

The last case seems to be the source of PHP's sometimes unfavorable 
reputation. :)

My argument isn't that an imported file shouldn't be eval()ed.  My
argument is that a language macro should be able to include files from
remote systems over protocols like HTTP.  Even without the security
implications, this is a huge hack for a language to have to implement an
HTTP client just to include a file as code.  The fact that PHP has this
behavior is a big surprise to many programmers.  A rather nasty surprise
that results in immediate compromise if you want to have dynamically
included files at all.

Ok, so here's a separate issue.  I don't disagree with your assertion
that it's a bad idea to allow an untrusted user to specify which files
are included as code.  This is obviously a dangerous thing.  However,
software needs to *fail gracefully*.

Let me say this again: Secure software *fails gracefully*.  The fact
that PHP includes a remote file import macro causes many minor
vulnerabilities to develop into very severe ones.  The typical public
website doesn't allow one to upload files.  This makes it very difficult
to execute code even if you can specify the file to load.

Since most languages don't have this inane feature like PHP does,
programmers aren't used to having to be so careful about injections into
these macros.  This is a big surprise and violates the premise I
mentioned previously.

Sure, if you're a l33t programmer, and you care about writing secure
code, it doesn't matter since you'd just avoid this and other issues.
Unfortunately those are two huge assumptions, the original poster (not
to mention every other PHP app on sourceforge) have clearly
demonstrated.

Unfortunately, what seems at first blush to be a fairly simple thing can 
get pretty complex, pretty fast (PHP's "safe_mode" has a whole, uhm, 
history.). Putting this level of restriction on a general default 
per-apache-process level, for example, can lead to hundreds of "allowed 
directories" in the web roots on a shared server available to PHP 
processes (one directory for each vhost), with possibly multiple PEAR 
include libraries for different users, so it's really something that 
should be handled on a per-script, per-program execution cycle, level 
(as required).... back to square one, though, if the programmers simply 
can't be bothered to write more secure code, or intentionally dodge the 
built-in features designed to keep themselves from shooting at their feet.

"all tend to..." might be a little broad....  :D as far as "convenience 
over security", that's up to the programmer. If, for example, a 
programmer wants to use prepared statements, transactions, and 
language-specific-db-string-escaping for SQL, they can. If they want 
straight raw SQL client, convenience, and speed, and are willing to 
suffer the potential drawbacks, they can.

Yeah, they'd never get bitten by XSS bugs that way, right?... ;)

I think the challenge is in trying to write a software application 
language that doesn't allow people to easily shoot themselves in the 
foot.... yet is still powerful enough to do all of the tasks they want, 
even if that task happens to be, uhm, easily shooting one's self in the 
foot.

Hey, I didn't say it was simple, but I also didn't say anything about 
having a configuration variable define the limits on fopen().  That 
sort of language feature just makes it hard to audit an application 
because now you have to also audit the configuration.  Things like 
this, register_globals, safe_mode, enable_exploits, allow_rootkit and 
such are a huge part of the reason that PHP is so horribly difficult to 
secure.

What I said was "a method for addressing filenames within the webroot". 
This has got nothing whatsoever to do with fopen() or the apache config 
outside of the fact that PHP fails to provide anything on that level of 
abstraction.

A much better way to do this is to have a 'webfile' object (subclassed 
from a 'file' object) which is guaranteed to throw an error if you try 
to do anything with one that contains the name of a file outside the 
webroot.

This would mean that, when reading some code, you could see "oh, he's 
using a 'file' object here.  That should be a 'webfile' object."

It would be quite simple to teach too -- "if you're doing something on 
the web, you always* want a webfile object".

(Aside:  If I suspected that exception-wary programmers would be reading 
it, "always" would say "almost always", but people who think like that 
would not have these troubles with security.)

Ah well, you would still get a bunch of useless tutorials telling you 
how to do it the wrong way anyway, but at least the language itself 
wouldn't be so gnarly.

Oh dear. I hope you're sitting down.

Yes, PHP I/O wrappers allow data to be accessed via http, but it's  
not like an http client was randomly or haphazardly bolted onto PHP's  
include() function... include() uses PHP's stream wrappers.

PHP's stream wrappers allow including and accessing streams of data  
(like, oh, files) via (depending on the config/compile/libraries):
file, http, https, ftp, ftps, stdin, stdout, stderr, filter, memory,  
temp, zlib, bzip2, rfc2397, glob, ssh, ogg, expect, CURL (so, another  
round of http(s), but also DNS/POP/IMAP etc.)...

... and since 4.3.0, (released in 2002) programmers could also write  
their own wrappers to handle/manage any stream they added, so a php  
application could, say, include data from an IRC chatroom, load data  
from an IP-based POS cash register, etc etc. (Side note: PHP does  
sockets, too.)

My comment about getting data from pigeon://african/swallow/ 
badness.php was about a PHP I/O *feature*, not merely a jest.

It's kinda a big thing to leave ignored/unsecured, or allow  
potentially-malicious user input to have unguarded control over.

Now, as to *why* this little tidbit would, or could, surprise people,  
I'm guessing a lack of training/knowledge, or awareness of the  
feature set of PHP. Glossing over the I/O abilities of any  
programming language is kind of a bad thing.

Well, it's not *a* (singular) macro, it's part of PHP's core I/O to  
be able to get, and send, data on local and remote levels.

Arguments can, and have been, made, that PHP should (by default) be  
dumbed back down to I/O along the lines of, oh, bash scripts, but  
it's far too important a feature set to remove entirely.

As long as the website isn't allowing users to submit I/O requests,  
it's not a problem. ;)

Of course, if programmers don't realize that they're handing around  
and executing insecure I/O requests, oh yeah... big problem.

Expected Issues:
Symlinks. Imports with changing mount points. Scripts that wget/exec/ 
mount (etc.) other code and readfile()/eval()/exec() it. PHP already  
using /usr/share/pear, /etc/php.ini, and a whole ton of code  
scattered around. Trying to keep/maintain a registry of thousands, or  
hundreds of thousands, of acceptable files/objects,  across thousands  
of servers, and their last "acceptable" load locations. Integrating  
with a meta-file abstraction, where you never know if the next "file"  
is coming from a disk, an IRC chat room, a user at a console, etc.

Many have seen this very monster, and then tried to slay the beast.  
Many have failed.

Patches Welcome. :)

(FWIW, (since it made me laugh) the "allow_rootkit", aka "safe_mode"  
stack, is being removed in PHP v6. Look at it as clearing the dead  
carcasses of "those who came before" being finally cleared from the  
battlefield.)

Namespaces and custom import/loading of namespaces (which should be  
helpful to "pin" applications to using files/objects from allowed  
namespaces) is rolling out soon, along with some built-in garbage  
collection. (This will, of course, make the language slower overall,  
but hey, folks want it!)

There will still be a bunch of useless tutorials and horridly bad  
documentation and related notes, however. (Seriously, though, if  
anybody wants to start editing the PHP manual and notes, it's always  
a short-handed, thankless, gig, looking for volunteers... I did it  
for years, and learned an immense amount of what to do, and not to  
do, with PHP. )

How are symlinks a problem other than that they could exist in the 
webroot?  The webroot is (of course) not writable by the httpd process, 
so this is unsurprisingly controllable and auditable.  Note that my 
suggested interface (e.g. a web-specific subclass of File::Fu) does not 
purport to be a cure-all, simply an easy way to not do most of "the 
absolutely wrong things" by default.

>Imports with changing mount points. 

Umm... what?

>mount (etc.) other code and readfile()/eval()/exec() it.

Yeah, perl doesn't try to stop you from saying eval(`curl $user_input`), 
yet I don't see that one too often.

>PHP already using /usr/share/pear, /etc/php.ini ...

I think it's more like pandora's box than a monster.  If you have only 
one super-dwimmy interface to a critical feature (open, include, etc) 
which itself contains 100 misfeatures, the only way to excise the 
misfeatures is to break existing code.

But, given that it isn't installed, I have the fortunate position of not 
feeling any need to fix PHP.  I only need to convince new developers to 
use Perl.

A programming language / framework / module with the philosophy that "if 
you want something special, you have to ask for it" is much less likely 
to surprise unsuspecting users with amazing security holes, er 
features.

Subject: [PLUG] Verizon FIOS, swapping out the Actiontec cable modem
Message-ID: <20080827062930.GA15653@gate.kl-ic.com>


No questions here, just some notes from an ongoing upgrade of
my Verizon FIOS connection.

So far, I have been mostly happy with Verizon FIOS.  With the 
Actiontec wifi cable modem that they installed, not so much.  
It seems to cause problems with DNS and NAT.

Back when I had Comcan't, my traffic routed through an old
Thinkpad 600 configured as a linux router/firewall/openvpn-port.
The Actiontec now sits between that and the ONT (Optical Network
Terminal).  Since the ONT has a 100baseT port on it, I have my
own router, and don't have a TV,  the Actiontec is a buggy
waste of 13 watts.  Time to swap it out, step by step.

I spent way more time than planned over the last couple of days
changing the Actiontec from router mode to "bridge" mode, where
incoming packets fly straight through to the laptop router,
without NAT.  I figured out how to do it from this:

http://www.broadbandreports.com/forum/r17679150-Howto-make-ActionTec-MI424WR-a-network-bridge

Some steps are out of sequence, and it is a PITA making the router
release the DHCP lease (I finally just unplugged the MoCA cable
about 3 seconds after clicking release).  I left the cable
disconnected through the rest of the reconfiguration into
bridge mode, and reconnected everything when I was done.  It
took about 3 tries to get it right.

Now i'net packets are moving unmodified to the laptop/firewall.
I will be running a Personal Telco node on its own CAT5,
somewhere near the roof, and I want that on its own DMZ.  That
implies 3 ethernet ports to the firewall: external, DMZ, and
internal.  The old laptop has no onboard ethernet, and only two
PCMCIA slots for ethernet cards.  Fortunately, the laptop has a
USB2 port, and I found a brand new 3com USB-to-100baseT adapter
in the Free Geek store, which provides the third ethernet port.
Like most hardware these days, it was linux plug and play.

The DMZ is isolated from the internal network with a few lines
in iptables to discard packets going between those ethernet
ports.  If there is a better way, I would like to know about it.
I still need to modify named.conf so that only internal and vpn
machines know about each other.  When I am using wireless from
my laptop, I will connect through openvpn, just as if I am 
coming in from the outside world.


For now, the bridge mode Actiontec is still in the signal path
converting MoCA cable to ethernet.  The next step is to ask
Verizon support to switch the ONT from MoCA cable to 100baseT. 
Here is a plausible recipe:

http://www.dslreports.com/faq/15990

After verifying that ethernet works through the Actiontec's WAN
port (allowing me to go back to MoCA if this doesn't work), I
will remove the Actiontec and connect the firewall/router
directly to the ONT.  

BTW, I have a few spare PCMCIA ethernet cards;  if the ONT
somehow gets lightning-zapped, that will tend to zap the PCMCIA
ethernet card instead of the whole laptop.  PCMCIA cards are
also nice because if the bad guys are attacking, I can pop both
PCMCIA cards and physically isolate the firewall/laptop and my
internal network from the nasties, then reboot the laptop from
a live CD to look for damage.

If anyone else embarks on this process, I hope this is helpful.

If you are now passing packets through you could take your laptop to
the ONT and connect it directly to see what you would get.  I don't think
there is much intelligence in the ONT.

I did try the Ethernet before doing all this, and it was powered
but not enabled.  They only activate one channel at a time, besides
the POTS, according to all the web pages I read, and I verified that.

Verizon FIOS technicians control the ONT directly, there is quite a
bit of smarts in the ONT, actually.  I called tech support, and the 
helpful fellow there got a network tech to change the connection 
from MoCA to Ethernet for me, and he camped on line while I finished
bringing things up.  He even released the DHCP lease a couple of
times, which is somewhat difficult with the Actiontec.

Three items: 
1) If you release the DHCP lease on the Actiontec, it will
take about 60 seconds to acquire a new one, and it will do so
automatically.  It is best to release the lease, wait 10 seconds,
then disconnect the Verizon side of the Actiontec.   Then hook
up your own router and request another DHCP lease with that.

2) The IP addresses assigned are all over the map;  at least 4
different address ranges so far.  Not a problem with dyndns pointing
at the dynamic IP, but interesting behavior anyway.  Their IP address
ranges are little chunks purchased from many different sources.

3) Before removing the Actiontec, I noted that the MoCA connection
base rate is 250Mbps.  They deliver video-on-demand with this.  
Right now, I have the minimum FIOS service, 5M up, 2M down.  If 
history repeats itself, that minimum will steadily increase.  Ten
years from now, when I decide that the 100Mbps ethernet is just
too slow ("a whole minute to download Ubuntu?  sheesh!"), I will
probably have to reactivate the MoCA cable connection.

Message-ID: <c834ec80808271224o29604a39gf4818eec6b03f9b2@mail.gmail.com>

I'm in the market for my first rackmount server, and I've realized
that it's been far to long since I've built a machine from scratch. (I
think I've been spoiled by laptops..).  This box won't be intensely
used, by any means, it's just the cheapest form factor to set up in a
friend's cabinet, so I'll have an always-on remote machine to host vcs
repositories, my wiki, blog, etc.  Once in a while I'll need to use it
for intense computation.

What do you folks do when you need a new 1u box? (Does anyone have
case/mobo/cpu/ram suggestions? Should I swallow my pride and get a
Dell?)  I have a fairly good idea of what I want as far as hardware:
dual quad-core ~2ghz processors, 4-8 gigs of ram, and roughly 1 TB of
disk space, but other than that I want something that will work, but
not break the bank (I'm not sure how to determine the power supply
necessary, ensuring memory compatibility, proper cooling, etc.).  It
will obviously be running Linux -- probably a bare, bare debian
install with 2-3 vmware server instances that actually have
interesting stuff installed :).

Poking around at Newegg has made it clear that I probably need to do
some reading if I decide to build my own, but first I'd like to see if
it's even worth the effort, or if I should just go with a pre-built
box.

Thanks!

I have Xen installed with one virtual machine created, but I'm not 
totally satisfied. The virtual machine was also 64-bit OpenSuSE 11.0, 
just like the host. 


Yast apparently will not allow me to get a screen resolution better 
than 800 x 600 in the guest, and there is no sound. The Internet 
connection works. The host hardware is fairly common: a K8V 
motherboard with an AMD64 3200+ CPU, not virtualization-enhanced, and 
a Geforce FX-5500 AGP card. 
I suspect that Qemu would provide better support than that. (I once 
had it running at 1280 x 1024 with the same display adapter.) Anyhow, 
how can I tune Xen for better performance?

I really like Penguin Computing's Altus 6xx line (currently at 650). 
They're advertised as cluster nodes, but they're fine as 
general-purpose 1U servers. They run Opterons, not Xeons, but you can 
get quad-core configs with all the memory and disk you require.

They come with Linux pre-installed, but I usually do a custom 
installation anyway.

They're at least worth a look-see:

rock-solid.  i bought it used on ebay for a song, and it's
now...hmm...probably 6 years old, and never goes down unless the power
drops (best uptime so far is just shy of 2 years).  well designed,
sturdy, linux-compatible kit;  & the company's been around for Awhile.

Go with a pre-built box if you can afford it and go with a known 
vendor.  The 1U form factor involves a lot of specialized engineering 
and you really need a vendor that has done a lot of volume to get it 
right.  Unless you go with a small disk form factor like the HP DL360, 
then you are going to have trouble getting 1TB of RAID 5 disk in the 
box, and please don't install it as RAID 0, you will really regret that 
decision when the array crashes and you need to restore 1TB from tape 
(your are planning on backing this up, right).  Hot swap is also good, 
but doesn't sound like a necessity in your case.

You will want dual power supplies, both for capacity and for 
redundancy.  Another reason not to do this yourself, the vendor has 
already done all the power consumption calculations for ALL the possible 
configurations.

Some specific models to consider.

I'm actually not planning on using raid, and for backups, I intend to
rsync nightly to an off-site server (the amount of disk I'm planning
to put in there is largely so I can use multiple VMs w/out being
worried about space).  The vast majority of the content will be
duplicated, since the VMs will be largely identical, and I'll have
off-site backups of them in a pristine state, along with incremental
backups of the configuration details, data, and code running on them.

I also could probably manage perfectly well with about 100 gigs, but
disk is cheap :)  My current server is a shared penguin computing 1u,
and we were recently bitten by the raid/lvm configuration -- some
content was corrupted and mirrored across the raid before we noticed.
When we *did* notice, the system went down and would no longer boot.
We would have lost the (software) raid conf, if it weren't for an
off-site backup (or good memory... I wasn't actually involved in that
restoration).  In any case, I am not in a situation where that degree
of high-availability is worth the premium it costs--periodic backups
are sufficient to manage the times when something goes down.

Re: penguin computing -- I like the company, and the issues we've had
with our current penguin 1u are probably due to environmental problems
(poor cooling at the colo).  My only hesitation is that it looks like
the same hardware can be had from Dell for significantly less (there
is about a $400 difference between the Altus 650 and a similarly
configured PowerEdge SC1435 right now).

Since neither company offers an OS I am comfortable with, I'll be
reinstalling on my own anyway. (And probably buying the disk(s) from
newegg, to save another couple hundred.)  I would sleep better buying
from penguin computing though :)

If you know anyone else getting FiOS, you might want to recommend they have 
ethernet run into their home instead of coax. That's what I did. They won't 
charge extra at install time and it's much easier to remove the actiontec 
router - just unplug the cat5e and connect to a new linux PC for routing :)

Hey, I'm working on a presentation with OpenOffice, but I am not
seeing how to print notes from it.  When I print, or export to PDF,
all I get is the "slides", not the notes or handouts or what have you.
So, just to repeat myself one more time, how do I get a hardcopy of
the notes??

When I print, there is an "Options" button on the left side of my Print

This should take care of the printf warning:

#include <stdio.h>

main(){
    printf("hello, world.\n");

You need

at the top, printf is defined there.

To add to the Options:  If you uncheck 'drawings' and click Notes, you'll
get one page per slide with 1/2 the space devoted to notes and 1/2 devoted
to the slide. If 'drawings' is left checked, you'll get a page for the slide
and a second page will be as described above.

Also,right  clicking the slides in the left column lets you change the
background so you can prevent printing that.

Another problem I've noticed with your program: you failed to declare 
the return type of main. It should look like this:

    int
    main( int argc, char[] *argv) {
    ...

    If you don't know already, the int means that the main method 
returns an integer (the return value of the program), the argc denotes 
the number of arguments passed to the program (including the name of the 
program itself, which means that argc is always >= 1), and the argv is a 
collection stringized command-line arguments passed to the program, 
which includes the name of the program itself.

    Try making your sample program look like the beginning of the main 
function above and it should compile just fine. If it doesn't, try 
subbing out the 'char[] *argv' with 'char **argv' and that should do the 
trick.

    Hope this helps.

Even in VMWare ESXi the virtual machine devices presented are not full
featured. The no sound/accelerated graphics could be a result of the virtual
device limitations. And shouldn't you just be using SSH to administer your
linux hosts. =P

I would look into what hardware abstraction they are using for Xen's virtual
devices.

If you are going to run multiple VMs off a single disk system you want to
watch out for I/O contention issues.  I would suggest a RAID 10 setup with
either 4 or 8 disks that will give you redundancy and max concurrent I/O.
RAID 5 is fine, but 10 on a 4 disk set would be ideal. I also suggest
hardware RAID in lieu of software to squeeze every clock cycle out of the
CPUs for the VMs.

I had the cat5 there, waiting to plug into the ONT, but the installer
insisted on running coax to an Actiontec.  Friendly enough fellow,
but it had to be done his way.  The coax is needed to feed video,
and MoCA is needed for video-on-demand, and the installer couldn't
imagine anyone surviving without a boob tube. 

I didn't fight too hard;  I didn't want him doing a bad job on
something he did not understand.  I would have preferred being
able to ask for the ethernet option when I scheduled the install; 
then they could have sent a contractor that was familiar with cat5
installs.  It was only later, when I realized what a PITA the
Actiontec was, that I realized I should have pushed harder for
ethernet instead of MoCA - during the installation request.

When people sign up for internet-only FIOS, they should make very
clear that they want the ethernet option installed, without the
Actiontec.  The few that succeed should tell us exactly what they
said, so we can share the magic incantation with others.  When an
installer shows up and actually installs cat5 connections, GET 
THEIR NAMES so the next folks that sign up can ask for the
installers that know how.

Here is another vendor to consider, and an example of a 4 disk RAID system
in 1U:
http://eracks.com/products/Xeon%20Systems/config?sku=NOCONA

This is just one example system, this one has 2 x dual core Xeons, they can
do pretty much whatever you want configuration-wise.
3ware hardware RAID controller, up to 16GB RAM, etc etc.
For more than 4 disks, or 4 disks with dual redundant power supplies, would
need to be 2U or more.
If you aren't dead set on 1U, and are willing to go 2U, that opens up a lot
more configuration possibilities.

eRacks is a Linux/BSD system vendor (rackmounts, desktops, laptops), located
in So. CA but with business all over.

Several people have already explained that you need
#include <stdio.h>

It might be good at this point to explain why the book your reading may
not have mentioned that. In the past, GCC was less picky than it is now.
Once upon a time, the above code would have compiled. As GCC has
improved, its ability to recognize errors and provide warning has
improved. While this results in higher quality code in the long term, in
the short term it makes GCC more annoying. If you find your book
repeatedly omits information necessary to compile with a modern GCC,
perhaps you will need to find a more correct book.

May I also suggest some flags to make GCC even pickier? This will help
you to learn good habits from the beginning.

gcc -pedantic -Werror -Wall -Wextra -Wfloat-equal -Wformat=2
-Wno-unused-parameter

This is only a taste of what GCC can do. Once you're more comfortable
with C, you may want to add extra checks like:
-Wtraditional -Wwrite-strings

I don't know how much you care about backwards compatibility. I don't
care much so I prefer coding against C99 instead of GNU C90, even though
GCC doesn't fully implement C99 yet.
-std=c99

You'll find that C is a grotty language with a complex history, but it's
also beautiful in its own way. Have a lot of fun!

If you're going to do a 1U then I suggest buying a built unit. You can 
save a lot of money by buying a barebone, then it still gives you a lot 
of control over the server in terms of what you want. 1U's are too 
specialized. The DIY stuff I've seen just doesn't compare to even decent 
quality desktop parts. Go to Newegg and look at their barebone systems 
from SuperMicro, Intel, and possibly ASUS, though I've never used ASUS 
for a server. Oh, and get ready for "loud".

  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816110030

It runs nearly silent, but still plenty cool. Only a single socket,
though. I was very impressed with the quality. I have a client who specs
nothing but Supermicro servers, and they've never had a hardware
failure. So I was planning to go the same way until I found this ASUS. 

It's also got a slot for an IPMI card, but I couldn't find anyone
selling the card at the time, 2 months ago.

With 8G RAM, 2 SATA2 drives and a quad-core Xeon at 2.4GHz, my
Kill-a-watt showed .6A draw at idle. Measure your systems and see how
that compares.

I solved the problem last night.  I discovered I needed to install more
software, libraries, GCC updates etc..  Ubuntu out of the box doesn't
have everything one needs to write a program.  I spent an hour and half
downloading 8G of "stuff" from the Ubuntu site and now it works.

Typical of a server build.  If you can't build a C program on the box,
neither can an attacker.

Carlos,

   Wouldn't this also by typical of an installation that defaults to end
users? They most likely would not build any new application from source;
rather, they'd download the binary from a ubunty repository.

Yes, except with a desktop system you're protecting the user from
himself, not others.  Just kidding.  But seriously, I have seen people
struggle with VMWare, for example, because there was no gcc and the user
didn't know what gcc was or why it was missing.  "But it installs on
redhat!", they say.  "Isn't fedora just like redhat?"  and so on.

If you cannot read the information below, click here.

Hi there?

Speakers, UG leaders, or anyone else interested in improving your
presentations, let me send you our new book "slide:ology". Garr
Reynolds (Presentation Zen) just wrote on his blog "Nancy Duarte, the
Principle of Duarte Design (the firm behind the creation of Al Gore's
Oscar-winning presentations), has published a presentation book for
the rest of us. It's called 'slide:ology: The Art and Science of
Creating Great Presentations.' 'slide:ology' is practical, it's highly
visual, and it's beautiful. I love this book."

Watch the book trailer.

Gabrielle Roth and Selena Deckelmann presented "Running a Successful
User Group" at OSCON 2008 in Portland this year. Here's their slide
show. They also put together a flyer with suggestions on every aspect
of running a user group.

Need a pass for Photoshop World in Las Vegas on Friday, September 5th
and Saturday, September 6th? I've got one I can send you.

We've got some great books coming out and we're looking for Amazon,
Slashdot, and oreilly.com reviews. If you're interested, new titles
include "Head First Ajax," "Head First Statistics," "Intellectual
Property and Open Source," "The Productive Programmer," "Website
Optimization," and "Programming .NET 3.5."

If you haven't had a chance to check them out, Deke McClelland's
dekePod videos are worth a watch or two. Subjects include 101
Photoshop Tips, Metadata Forensics, the Virgin Histogram, Lab Mode,
and Stretching Photos in Illustrator. We've got plenty more on the way
so think about subscribing in iTunes by searching for dekePod or
bookmarking our dekePod page.

And thanks to everyone who stopped by the O'Reilly booth at OSCON. We
had a great time. Here are our photos from our T-shirt contest and the
conference.

Don't forget we're willing to send books to giveaway at your meetings
anytime. Although we love reviews, we don't expect them for every book
we send. You can also request books for special events or your group
library.

To all who responded to this thread, thank you.  I sent a message to the 
webmaster stating that the local gurus said...it was probably left over 
from setting up the server...(I am paraphrasing) and the problem 
resolved itself.

Ah, dependency hell. Over the years I've gradually built up recipes  
to copy/paste in the command line, just to have the right packages,  
and not waste time re-finding stuff. Here's my current base (without  
the freetds, that's another 5 lines, from a non-official repository)  
single *line* for getting the dependencies for rebuilding my stock  
PHP application server rpm's (off of the rpmforge spec):

# yum install wget nano make autoconf automake rpm-build postfix  
fileutils file libtool gcc cpp gcc-c++ perl-DBI libc-client-devel  
libstdc++-devel bzip2-devel curl-devel db4-devel expat-devel gmp- 
devel aspell-devel httpd-devel libjpeg-devel libpng-devel pam-devel  
openssl-devel sqlite-devel zlib-devel pcre-devel krb5-devel cyrus- 
sasl-devel openldap-devel postgresql-devel unixODBC-devel libxml2- 
devel net-snmp-devel libxslt-devel libxml2-devel expat-devel ncurses- 
devel gd-devel freetype-devel readline-devel libmcrypt-devel libtidy- 
devel freetds-devel mhash-devel

...and sometimes I still have flashbacks to the "early days" of  
package management, when a single build macro script could easily run  
thousands of lines long... *shudder*.

On a related note, I was once asked (in 2006!) in a tech job  
interview (position: Security Researcher): "What would you do if you  
couldn't install a piece of software because of a missing library,  
that you couldn't get with a package manager?"

I asked if it was a trick question, when they assured me it wasn't, I  
hesitantly said "Uhm, er, download the sources, edit the config and  
compile scripts as needed to match the target platform, and then make  
and make install it?" Out of all the people they had interviewed, I  
was apparently the *only* one who even mentioned actually downloading  
and building it myself. I got the job. :)

Compiling by hand is rapidly becoming a lost art.... again....

help you.  :)  I've included step by step plans here & on the
BerkeleyTIP-Global Group website.  Ask questions to the
BerkeleyTIP-Global mailing list, & the community can help each other

discuss anything & everything.


=====  1 WEEK TO ARRANGE LOCAL MEETINGS  =====
With 1 week to go before the meeting, 
you have ample time to arrange a local meeting place & meeting.

I've created a simple plan/ set of instructions for you 
- all you have to do is follow the steps.

There's already been interest expressed in BatonRouge, Boston, Chicago,
Denver, Detroit, Hawaii, Montana, NorthCarolina, Virginia, Canada &
Columbia.  & Berkeley/SiliconValley.  & from FSF, FreeBSD & Debian
people. (And that's just from my small, part time effort on this.)

Maybe it's you. (& it's straightforward, and easy to do.)


=====  WHO SHOULD ATTEND  =====
Parts of this meeting are relevant for:
Computing & technology professionals, business people, non-profits,
educators, students, scientists, (re)searchers, engineers, artists, &
home & personal computer users.

The meeting is Free, no money $ cost.
- & You might want to make a donation to support its growth/benefits.

I invite you to join our mailing list at
http://groups.google.com/group/BerkTIPGlobal


=====  VOLUNTEERING - ME & YOU  =====
Note:  I'm putting this together as my volunteer effort for the
community, in my almost nonexistent "free/spare" time.   I've designed
this as a "self-reliant" event.  I'll certainly try to help everyone
out, but this event doesn't depend on me - if _you_ want a successful
event, it depends on _you_ (collectively).  It's a self reliant event, &
I've worked hard to ensure it is easy for you to succeed in making &
having a successful event/ experience(s).

Forward this announcement wherever you think it will do some good: like,
any list you don't see me posting this to.

I'm sending this to about 15 LUGs around the USA, plus come topic
groups, ex BSD, FSF, GNU, Debian, Gentoo, KDE, GNOME, Python.  Fee free
to send this announcement to any community email list where it could do
some good.


=======================================================================
=======================================================================
If I had lots of time, I'd complete this section.  But, since I want
this announcement to go out now, I'll leave this merely as complete as
it is.  You can find most of this information on the BerkTIPGlobal group
website.  Ask any questions you have on the group mailing list.

This next meeting I am stepping this up from a local Berkeley meeting,

I'm working to get USA locations up & connected.  I call this month's
meeting "Global-USA".  Anyone is welcome to set up a simultaneous
meeting anywhere in the world.  But _my_ efforts this month are
primarily directed to getting USA groups going.  Next month I'll focus
on getting Americas' groups added.

Bop,

   I'm sorry to read that. It is so simple and takes so little time on modern
systems that everyone should do it just for the knowledge.

   My experience (based on six years of Red Hat followed by five years with
Slackware) has been that the latter is so easy for local builds that it's my
accepted practice. There is a very active group who participate in (and
manage) slackbuilds.org. Their efforts provide scripts to build almost
everything into a Slackware package using the same standards and criteria as
the core distribution does.

   Using a SlackBuild script I not only build locally (and with the proper
dependencies for each distribution version), but intallation and upgrade (or
removal when desired) is handled by the package management system. Best of
both worlds.

   Wonder why folks fear and avoid the 'configure; make; make install' dance.

I don't fear 'make install', but I sure appreciate the lowered barrier
to entry to trying new software provided by package management that
lets me trivially remove it.

Well, for openers, because not every package conforms to that schema,
and *effort* is required from the *developers* of the package to make it
that easy for the user. Second, because when it croaks, the user now has
to interact with the developers.

As you probably recall, I run Gentoo, which is mostly a
build-from-source distro, whose "packages" are mostly shell scripts to
build from source. I'm so used to it now, I don't give it a second
thought, but when I migrated from Debian (Woody) to Gentoo (1.4), my
compute and download resources were much less powerful than they are
today, and compile times were a significant expense.

It needed to be said, thank you for saying it. Unless you're a developer
or a hobbyist looking to have fun, installing from source is probably
not a wise decision. While it may not be hard to do, the long term
maintenance cost is much higher and can probably only be justified for
the most critical parts of one's infrastructure.

And yes, I am ashamed to sound so much like a corporate sell out.

Dan,

   Good point. Not every source tarball has a 'make uninstall' included. That
should be a given.

Stuart,

   Consider using checkinstall. It replaces 'make install' and offers the
options of creating a package in .rpm, .deb, or .tga format (Red Hat/Fedora,
Debian, and Slackware formats). Then upgrades or removals use the package
management tools.

I'm familiar with checkinstall, however it has several deficiencies:

1) It only records metadata that can be programmaticly captured. For
example, it can determine required and provided symbols but it can't
determine required or provided capabilities such as "webserver". Nor, as
far as I'm aware, can it distinguish between reguirements vs.
suggestions as supported by .deb packages.

2) It does not strictly follow distribution specific conventions. Most
distributions include patches to integrate software with the system. As
a result, such packages are at best second class citizens.

3) Most importantly, you are still accepting responsibility for watching
for security and other bug fixes. Performing Q&A. Possibly backporting
patches when an upgrade is too disruptive. Etc. Doing so only makes
sense for software that is truly unique and critical to your
infrastructure. When such is the case, one might as well take a little
extra time and care to package software with the tools and conventions
of one's distro.

   Quite true.

   While I've no familiarity at all with Debian and its offspring, I used to
know how to write a .spec file to create a Red Hat .rpm and I use
(occasionally writing one myself) a SlackBuild script.

   If the application is important, then it should be worth the effort to get
a good package building script for it. Bug fixes and security uprgrades can
be built using the same script and installed using the distribution's
package management tools.

   My original point is that there are tools available build package
management compatible installation/upgrade files, so it's unfortunate that
folks don't take the time to learn and benefit from their use.

   Time to get this fixed, and I'm out of ideas.

   Running Xubuntu-8.04 on my wife's laptop. When trying to send a message a
progress box appears displaying the message, "connected to <mail server>,"
and another dialog box asks for her password on the server. We enter that,
and check the box to have the system remember that user and password, then
click the "OK" button.

   The progress bar indicator happily cycles from left to right, but the
dialog box asking for her password keeps popping up. No matter how many
times it's entered, the question re-appears and the message is not sent.

   Where do I start looking for the source of this problem so I can fix it?

Usually indicates that you are using the wrong password. Can you confirm 
that you are using the correct password?

Chris,

   Yes, I can. As root on the server I just reset it to her password. Tried
sending a message from her laptop and it still keeps asking for her
password. As a user, I su'd to her login on the server and the password
worked.

If you have root on the mail server she's connecting to.... do the mail logs
say anything interesting?

wes,

   Yes, as it turns out. It's a SASL authorization failure:

Aug 29 10:30:04 salmo postfix/smtpd[5938]: connect from wap.appl-ecosys.com[192.168.55.200]
Aug 29 10:30:04 salmo postfix/smtpd[5938]: warning: SASL authentication failure:
  cannot connect to saslauthd server: Permission denied
Aug 29 10:30:04 salmo postfix/smtpd[5938]: warning: SASL authentication failure:
  Password verification failed
Aug 29 10:30:04 salmo postfix/smtpd[5938]: warning: wap.appl-ecosys.com[192.168.55.200]:
  SASL PLAIN authentication failed: generic failure

   So, it's with my postfix setup. Reading again the SASL_README file,
/usr/lib/sasl2/smtpd.conf contains:

# Global parameters
log_level: 4
pwcheck_method: saslauthd
mech_list: PLAIN LOGIN

   Do I need to explicitly run /usr/bin/saslpasswd2? Should I ask on the
postfix mail list rather than here?

Thanks,

Rich

I would have to say yes, this is a pretty postfix specific problem, and the
folks on the postfix list may be better equipped to help you.

however, you could try to replicate postfix's behavior and see what you get.
what happens if you try to run saslpasswd2? does it work? what happens if
you try to do this as the user that postfix is running as?

Well yes, it is definitely a problem with postfix contacting the sasl auth
gateway. it even says "permission denied" in the log, which is more than you
usually get in this type of situation. That is why I suggested attempting to
replicate the authentication step in my other post.

wes,

   I'm not confident of my understanding of the saslpasswd2 command line
syntax suggested in the README file. I'll ask on the postfix mail list.

Thanks very much,

wes,

   However, if I FUBAR my mail server then I'll never get it fixed because I
cannot read or write messages. Perhaps I'm a wimp, but I try to avoid
running system-level executables when I don't understand what they do. I
leave that to folks running non-essential systems.

I sometimes do 'configure --prefix=/packages/foo ; make ; make

there are a ton of systems that facilitate this kind of behavior, some
of which i've used and loved:

gnu graft - http://freshmeat.net/projects/graft/ (makes symlink farms
from the private dir, uninstalls cleanly)
opt_depot - http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/csd/opt_depot/
(enterprise-grade multiplatform capable)

and then systems to take advantage of the fact that you can now have a
zillion versions of anything installed (yeah, i liked the old firefox
better, but would rather modify my environment to run it than making
an alias or naming the script firefox2): ...which was called
"modules", which is now ungoogle-able :/

i love setting things up this way myself.  i even re-abstracted some
packages so i could easily update the system version of glib and
others without yanking them out from under gnome (which i gave its own
private /packages/gnome/* hierarchy where i built a version of glib i
left alone).

truly, this system used to work better before the shenanigans with
library versioning and non-backward or forward compatibility crept
into the post-gnome world (freetype was a frequent offender, but glib
did it a few times too and so did some KDE-required libs).

due to all of those experiences, i have not tried to build gnome or
kde from source in the past 2 years, and do love my package manager
more...

I have encountered more enlightened developers/distributors who create a new
directory as part of their install, to make it easier to uninstall.  Xampp's
version of lampp is the first that comes to mind.

 Well, you're right of course, but, it's already broken - you're not likely
to break it more by poking at it.

I did say "likely" which means you don't do that on a production system.

(Actually I do that sometimes - shhhhh don't tell anyone!)

Subject: [PLUG] Virus / Worm Check
Message-ID: <1220041298.8431.8.camel@UbuntuHH>

Folks, 

I'm seeing a proliferation of "returned emails", apparently from
spammers who are using my email address. I'm running Hardy Heron 8.04.1.

I've been trying to figure out how to filter out these returned emails,
but there's a wide variety of return emails from spam filters.

Based on my research, I think I may need to check for a possible Linux
worm, but am not sure what to use. I have ClamAV installed, but the
Ubuntu help page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ClamAV suggests it's
only good for Windows viruses - and an update via 

freshclam

suggests that this is outdated. From the "outdated" clamscan, I have no
viruses.

So I guess I have two questions - 

1) If you've been victimized by a spammer who has used your email as a
return address - what do you do?
2) What approach should I take to virus / worm checking?

Thanks,
Mike

Oops, replied too quickly. What does freshclam show? That your config 
files are current, but that you're running 0.92.1 instead of 0.93.3?

Nothing.  There's nothing stopping anyone from spoofing your email
address.  The best thing you can do is try to prevent the spammers from
getting your email address in the first place.

Those mail servers that are bouncing messages back to you because
they're considered spam are configured by fools.  They're just doubling
the amount of traffic created by the spam.  Return addresses are
meaningless when it comes to spam.


> 2) What approach should I take to virus / worm checking?

It's highly unlikely that you have a virus or worm.  There have only
been a handful of Linux/Unix based worms (compared to the numbers of
Windows ones at least) and none recently that I'm aware of.  If you were
compromised, it's unlikely an attacker would just send spam as you from
a Linux box.  They'd probably be using it for much more interesting
things, such as a command and control box or an anonymizing proxy, etc.
No point in trying to tip you off by sending emails in your name.  It's
also highly unlikely that any AV software would catch what you're
compromised with (if you were).  You could try running rootkit hunter
and chkrootkit to see if anything comes up fishy.


HTH,
tim

Yup, I followed the instructions in the URL cited in the message too,
but I didn't find any more current packages in the Hardy repos, so I ask
here. 

I just looked in a bit more depth. First preference is to just find the
latest binary, and I see version 0.93.1 in the Gutsy repos. But that's
not 0.93.3, as suggested by the message - and the ClamAV cited Hardy
repo at http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-clamav/ubuntu/dists/hardy/ seems
to be empty.

I guess the next step is to uninstall the Hardy package, and build from
source per the Wiki. 

But do you know if that's going to help me - w/r/t the "Joe_job" issue.

Thanks,
Mike

   No, it's not broken because I've not had any problems with sending mail.
Only she does from the different network host.

   Following up on feedback from the postfix mail list, I made a bunch of
changes and additions to /var/spool/postfix/ and got saslauthd running, but
there's still a permissions issue. Sigh.

   You're seeing bounce-back, not spam.

   If you're not running your own mail server, I'm not sure how to set up
SpamAssassin to reject these.

   No, it's normal mail behavior when your address has been spoofed on spam
sent out.

Note: checkinstall only works for 32bit systems.  Even the source
doesn't build correctly
for 64 bit systems.

It's true that mail functionality is not broken, but my point is that you're
not likely to break said mail functionality by playing with saslauthd.
Theoretically (aka irrelevantly), it's the function of sending mail from
another host, authenticating via saslauthd, that is broken. I can only
assume from the context that you only have the one user sending mail from
another host.

If that is the case, you may want to consider finding another way to
authenticate that host.

If you would like us to help with the remaining issue, it would be helpful
to know what changes were made, and what effect (if any) those changes had
on the previously reported symptoms.

Wes,

   Yup.

> If that is the case, you may want to consider finding another way to
> authenticate that host.

   Thinking more about the entire issue, I may remove the SASL authorization
requirement since I added it only with the upgrade to postfix-2.5.2. She
works on her laptop only here in the house and we've not had any issues in
past years. So SASL authorization may be security overkill equivalent to
using a 12-ga shotgun with museum loads to kill flies.

   FWIW, I ran testsaslauthd with her username and password and our domain as
the realm and it succeeded. Ergo, theoretically everything should work.

Thanks,

Rich

I appreciate everyone's help. In any case, I've figured out enough
keywords and phrases to filter out 95%+ of the bounce-back (hopefully
keeping the important stuff). If this happens again, I might just have
to bite the bullet and start configuring my own email server for real. 

Any recommendations? I've played with sendmail and Postfix, hear good
things about qmail.

The stuff that's harder, or near impossible to filter is the non-english

You don't want to get into the business of filtering keywords manually.
That's just a rabbit's hole.  For content filtering, you're going to
want to use a bayesian filter of some variety.  There's quite a few out
there, some built into mail clients, some stand-alone.  I personally use
CRM114, which is incrediby accurate, but takes some feeding and
maintenance.  You could plausibly use it without a mail server.  If you
do set up a mail server, you'll want to have something set up to block
known-evil source IPs.

> Any recommendations? I've played with sendmail and Postfix, hear good

I use qmail.  It's fast, very secure and quite simple.  However, it's
not really actively maintained, so you have to wade through a plethora
of third party patches when you want this or that feature.  (That might
start to improve soon, since it's been released into the public domain,
but only time will tell.)  I don't recommend sendmail, simply due to
it's blatantly poor security track record.  Postfix is pretty popular
and easy to set up, so it might be a good first mail server to try out.

good luck,
tim

I have run my own mail server since the mid 80's (sometimes wondering 
why).  I used to use sendmail when I was running HP-UX but moved 
gleefully to postfix/spamassassin on Linux (RH9, RHEL, FC4 then settled 
on Debian).  It takes a little set-up and "training" the baysian system 
and occasional maintenance (usually minor tweaking depending on the kind 
of spam you receive and how smart the spammers are) but is well 
supported and, best of all, it works.

Hi all,

If you were at my "Stupid USB Keyboard Tricks" talk last month and 
have "trunkphobia", the official "real soon how" has arrived.  The 0.02 
tarball should be working its way through the mirrors right now.

  http://search.cpan.org/dist/Linux-USBKeyboard/

You'll need the libusb-dev package from your favorite distro, then just 
`cpan Linux::USBKeyboard` should do the trick.

If you can't wait a few hours (and don't have "tagphobia"), you can get 
it here:

  http://scratchcomputing.com/svn/Linux-USBKeyboard/tags/0.02/

Be sure to try the examples/echo_bacon.pl.

If you have a barcode scanner, the barcode lookup program I demo'd is in 
the toys directory.

For those with a credit card magstripe reader, feel free to contact me 
with questions about how to hook that to your mail program ;-)

Mike,

   I've been using postfix for at least five years and really like it. The
support is awesome, Ralf Hilterbrandt wrote a terrific book that helped me
tremendously, and it is comparatively simple to set up, maintain, and use.

   I had not tried to enable SASL authorization until the most recent postfix
upgrade. Since there is only one affected user, and we had no security
issues over the preceeding years, I just disabled the check.

   Her mail flows outbound once again and I can use the time for more
important things ... such as client work.

I have a webserver / DNS server in my DMZ, which servers up different DNS
results depending on the source.  So external DNS queries to my domain get
my public IP, while DNS queries from my internal network to the server
returns the internal DMZ IP address.

What do I need to do to have my local DNS servers (those in my internal
network) look first at the DMZ server for DNS resolution (for these domains)
and if it doesn't return something (say for google) then look on the
Internet.

I don't think this is a forwarder entry in the named.conf file, as this is
what I would do for all DNS resolution.

Or is there another method I should be using.

Should go in your local view if you are using Bind 9.
The db.cache file is a list of the root nameservers on
the Internet and it needs to be kept up to date.  Your
local and external view should share the same db.cache.

Sounds like a split-horizon situation to me, with the horizon master  
set as the default querying server... only you're adding in a layer  
of *multiple* split horizons, where the DMZ server knows about this  
internal/external situation, but other internal severs are blind to  
this, or only *some* of the servers know the split-horizon results?

Is there some technical reason for running a flock of different DNS  
servers, instead of one or two powerful ones in the DMZ that handle  
all internal *and* external requests?

Can your internal DNS machines act as slaves (for internal zones) to  
your DMZ server, and have the internals do split-horizon?

Is perhaps "Split Horizon DNS" the magic words you needed to know, in  
order to google this easily? :)
