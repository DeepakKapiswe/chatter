Okay, this is not intended to start a distro war.
I use Suse 9 and Redhat 7.3 and Suse 7.
I want to try Fedora core and Redhat's last*Free* distro.

What I want to know is if there are security issues to avoid with any
of the present distros or the older distros I'm interested in( Suse
8.1, Fedora Core, Redhat 9.1, etc) and I'd like to know which distro
the plug group has found to be:

a) easy to install
b) simple to work from both command and GUI
c) available as ISO
d) Useable as both server ware and desktop ware
e)Full featured
f) Free


<RANT ON>
Now, I don't mind paying for a distro that works.
But it goes along way with me if friends can get it for free.
I'm about done working with Linux if every time a distro gets to a
point it is usable to me, they go main street marketing route and
leave the little guys behind that helped them reach market share. I
may not be a developer that adds a significant piece of software to
the package, but I am the guinea pig that runs the dang thing and
finds flaws. I feel that for my contribution I should be compensated
by free access to the package. After all, I'm the one investing
hardware to run the distro on.
Besides, I'm a cheap old bastard.
<RANT OFF>

SO, any suggestions?

This, and particulary your goals below, scream "Debian", at least in my opinion.

Debian is probably one of the least likely main-stream distros for
going comercial, ala Red Hat.  It's extremely easy to install Debian
with _no_ non-free software at all--this is the default. (adding
non-free is not hard either, and the install prompts you regarding
this).

I would not install debian from ISO though (although you can do this).
 The cd images are quite out of date, and packages are updated
frequently.  The biggest downside to debian is that its packaging
system really /wants/ broadband.  It will work on dialup, or
disconnected.  It's just not as slick, and your system will probably
be a little bit behind the times.

If you choose to go with debian, you will probably want to install the
"Sarge" release, which is one step closer to the bleeding edge than
the "stable" (woody) release.  (Stable, in debian terms, is
rock-solid, in my experience sarge is on par with redhat / mandrake
stable releases.)

You may have not meant to start a distro war, but you have :-)  Here
are my personally biased recommendations:

Mandrake, Fedora, Suse, well, it's probably easier to list the few
remaining distros that aren't easy to install (and that is still
relative to your experience level, I recently had a pretty easy time
installing Slackware, but it wouldn't have been easy a few years ago).

Hey, Mandrake again.

Mandrake, though I have to admit here that Fedora Core 3 is ahead of
Mandrake 10.1 at the moment with LVM and SELinux.

Mandrake, Fedora Core, certain versions of Suse, and a bunch of
others, unless you are Richard Stallman, then no distro is entirely
Free.

Debian and "easy to install" have not traditionally gone hand-in-hand.
 Has something changed in this area recently?  I've heard about a new
Debian installer, but last time I checked it was still pretty rough
around the edges.

STOP!
This is what I want to avoid.
You may express your opinion on which distro you prefer. HOWEVER, that
does not mean you may raz another's opinion. This is distro warfare.
What I'm looking for is information in which I may gather both ideas
and suggestions from in order to try some new versions, explain to
clients why such and such distro is better for their experience levels
and to avoid pitfalls of such things as trying a dead distro( I used
to love OS 2)
SO, in order to keep the traffic on "he said, she said" down to a
minum, I'd ask that you not go beyond the," I found Mandrake to be
valuable because......." kinds of statements.

Thanks for your co-operation,

Harry

My installation experience is limited to Red Hat/Fedora, Debian, and 
Gentoo. I was just given responsibility for a SuSE box at work, but I 
didn't perform the installation.

Fedora is very easy to install. Fedora Core 3 has up-to-date 
software and security fixes usually arrive in a timely manner. The 
downside is the lifecycle of any given Fedora release is only 12 
months or so. I've never upgraded from one Fedora to another, so I 
can't really speak to the possibility of upgrading to each new 
release. You can use yum or apt or up2date to manage packages.

I haven't installed Debian in the past nine months, but I can't say it 
was easy. On a couple occasions, packages didn't upgrade cleanly, 
which required more Googling than I'd have liked. On the upside, it's 
very easy to keep your machine current using the "testing" release. 
It's also got a mind-boggling number of packages.

The Gentoo installation process is *very* well documented, but it 
assumes you know what you're doing and is rather time-consuming. I'm 
not a big fan of the manner in which the package-update process deals 
with config files, but otherwise it's an easy system to keep up to 
date with current software releases.

I've just started administering a SuSE box, but the yast2 tool makes 
package maintenance pretty easy. I'm not yet sold on using reiserfs as 
the default filesystem, but I can't say it's given me any troubles.

I was just interested in some clarification on the current state of
installing Debian, I didn't mean to come off sounding like a troll.  I
apologize.

I don't think you did, Bryan. And I don't think that someone can tell 
you what you can post in the thread and what you can't, just because 
they started it :)

I've had similar feelings about Debian, but it's been a while since I've 
tried the installer so perhaps things have gotten smoother.

Paul mentioned Gentoo, I used that for a while and really like it. One 
thing that's great is the way they deal with dependencies - they have 
what they call slots, where multiple versions of a package (like a 
library) can be installed at the same time. If you've run into 
dependency problems before with other distros, I'm sure you'll 
understand what a cool idea this is.

No apology needed. I was wanting to head off any slide towards the

The debian installer has certainly improved in the last 2-3 years, but
I must say my comments reflect the sarge installed, not the installer
packaged on the woody install ISOs.  Technically, this installer is
stil beta, however many people I know (my self included) have had good
luck with it.  It also provides 2.4 install kernels (use the bf24
kernel on the install medium--when you boot up there are
instructions.)

I've done at least one install where I did nothing but hit enter, and
had a useable system at the end--I wouldn't recommend this route, but
it can be done.  The installer is not graphical, however, which I
think scares a lot of people off.  Redhat, Mandrake, SuSe, and I'm
assuming Fedora Core have much fancier looking installers.

An additional dissadvantage to debian is that it will not
install/configure most recent video cards to do hardware acceleration
on it's own.  This comes back to the Free (as in speech) nature of the
distribution.  Recent ATI cards (9200 and newer?) and all GeForce
cards have proprietary drivers that are required for hardware
acceleration--thes can be installed, and the processes to do so are
well documented, but it is something you will have to do.  Mandrake
and others may be able to do this more automatically, but I don't have
experience with them.

In general, it is easier to get a "slick looking" linux install with a
distro like Mandrake etc.  but in my experience (most recently this
was RedHat 9 and Mandrake 10--so it's a bit dated) I was able to build
a more easily maintanable system with Debian, but I have dedicated
much more time to learning to use the debian tools and I am more
aquainted with the system, so I can't make an objective comparison.

Since you're already familiar with the Red Hat offerings, I'd suggest
you stick with them.  I recently tried a bunch of different distros
and rejected all of them for various reasons which, if detailed, would
start the distro-war you want to avoid.  From the tone of your
message, I suspect that you want to wash your hands of Red Hat for
nontechnical reasons.

If you can stick with Red Hat or its GPLed derivatives, I recommend
White Box Linux or CentOS-- both Red Hat Enterprise Linux clones. 
They fit all your requirements a through f.

Note that this is also true with Fedora Core and, afaict, Gentoo. You 
have to install non-standard packages to get binary-only drivers. For 
Fedora, some binary stuff is available via http://rpm.livna.org/, a 
third-party site.

I recommend Fedora. I recently made a half-assed effort to install debian and the installer did not recognize my hard drive. This lead me to the conclusion that the install process was not easy enough (for me anyway).

Same with Mandrake and Suse too, at least the free versions.  Nvidia
driver by hand, not too painful, but could be much easier.

In the spirit of full disclosure, rpm.livna.org didn't have an rpm for
the amd64 binary nvidia driver last time I checked.

After not having much success with the Debian Sarge installer, I was given a 
SuSE 9.1 CD. It installed over Debian Woody just fine, but kept those old 
partitions (I backed up what little data I had and just assumed the SuSE 
installer would give me the option to wipe the drive and start fresh). I'm 
slowly working my way to making this my main machine, but before I do, I need 
to find out what's making it hang every few days.

The reason this is relevant to Paul's comment is that I've been glad that SuSE 
9.1 installs reiserfs as a default because I haven't had to sit through  
(whatever the Linux equivalent is for scandisk). But, now I'm wondering if a 
bad spot on the drive is the problem, or if there is something about reiserfs 
that I don't know about, and should.

So, my question to Paul is, what are your hesitations about reiserfs?

And my question to the list in general is, what program(s) do folks use for 
thorough testing of a hard drive? I'm willing to back up the small amount of 
data on this machine, and don't mind reinstalling the OS, so a test that 
wants to write over everything is OK. Besides, reinstalling would let me 
reclaim those old partitions from my Debian experiments.

ext3, jfs, and xfs all solve the same problem; reiser isn't the only 
journaling filesystem available. :-)

> reiserfs?

Early in both the 2.4 and 2.6 kernel-developement cycles, the kernel 
developers reported several problems with reiserfs. I'd guess that 
they've been cleaned up, but I don't follow filesystem development 
well enough to know. As recently as 2.4.18, some folks have 
experienced subtle problems with reiserfs on SMP systems.

That, and Zach Brown told me once that he thought Hans Reiser's code 
was little more than a mess. (Yes, that's an ad hominem argument, but 
I tend to trust Zach's judgment on system-level issues.)

But, like I said, reiserfs hasn't caused me any grief on the SuSE box, 
so I can't say I'm down on it; I just tend to use ext3 or xfs when 
given the choice.

One of the school districts I often work with (who happen to be near
Redmond Washington ;-) is having SMP performance problems with the
Sarge 2.6.8-i686-smp kernel.

They are working on a backup server. The symptom is that if they fire
up 6 concurrent backup processes, every minute or so one of the
processes
goes to 100% wa state, the others go to 100% idle, the backup processes
go to a D state, and nothing happens for 10 - 60 seconds. Then
everything
works again for another minute.

Running the same tests on a Red Hat box, every process runs, raising
the load average to 6 as would be expected. The throughput is twice
as high as the Debian box.

Have any of you Debian gurus here seen this, and more importantly
know a fix? ;-)

Ok... Having installed all of these... (at one time or another)
And basing my opinions on a freshly installed machine. (aka no mods)

a) Installation

SUSE: The initial install is REALLY easy. Even if you don't know linux.

Redhat and Fedora: Are about the same level of complexity. They seem to have
really adopted the ext3 file system. :(

Debian: After the initial set of menu's the installation goes pretty good.

Slackware: Recent slackware distro is actually harder to install then older
versions. Don't know why.

b) Command and GUI

Redhat and Fedora: This is the standard that everybody else gets graded by.

SUSE: From a GUI standpoint, SUSE did it right. You can transfer between
window/desktop managers and all your settings come with you. Very Nice.
Shell level. It all works, but SUSE has its own organization with regards to
the file system setup as well as some unique commands for configuration and
updates.

Debian: Matches up to Redhat just fine. Shell level nearly identical to 
Redhat. Major difference is all the apt commands.

Slackware: Various desktop mangagers can be frustrating; however, I find
slackware shell to be a tad faster than Redhat.

c) ISO

Redhat, Fedora, Slackware, SUSE, and Debian can all be obtained as an ISO. 
HOWEVER...

Redhat is getting out of distributing the ISOs.

SUSE is limiting the ISOs distributed.

Debian is best installed over the network.

d) Useable as both server ware and desktop ware

All of these distros can be used in either capacity.

e) Full featured

Fedora, Debian and Slackware: Definitely full featured. Downside is there
are several ISOs to download to get everything.

Redhat: Enterprise version has everything. ($179 -> $2500 depending on need)

SUSE: Professional version has everything. ($90)

f) Free

Ok. Ya want your free lunch... 

Debian, Fedora, and Slackware are all FREE. (as in air)

Redhat, well you saw the price.

SuSE. You saw it's price also.



I hope that this helps Harry. I didn't include distros like Mandrake, Yellow
Dog, Gentoo, Ubantu, SE-Linux or any of the myriad of others that exist. I
will say that the number of distros that have been reported lately is
considerably less then what there was several years ago.

The big players have their market share... and are beginning to extract rent
from us little people.

Caveat: I don't use Debian's kernels, I compile my own from vanilla
tarballs.  

This might not be relevant, but I have seen thus far unexplained I/O
stalls on firewire/SBP2 attached storage when rsyncing to reiserfs
partitions.  Your friends stalls are very similar sounding.  I
especially see them running a "vmstat 1".

You might compare .configs or patches between the kernels.

My first indication would be to compare the .config files for each
kernel to see what's different, also to check out and see if there are
any patches applied to either kernel.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0412011755330.17340-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I have a situation where I need to grep -vif a file writing the results 
back into the orginal file.  I'd _really_ rather not create a temporary to 
do this and every trick I can think of doesn't work.

An example of the way I'm trying to avoid.

/bin/cat transport.lst | grep -vif no-imgate.lst > transport.map

With "relay_recipients.map" containing the final results.  I don't want to
create the "transport.lst" if at all possible.  Keep the hits on the disk 
to a minimum.

Tricks like these _don't_ work.

grep -vif no-imgate.lst < transport.map > transport.map
cat transport.map | sort | grep -vif no-imgate.lst  > transport.map
cat transport.map | sort | grep -vif no-imgate.lst | sort > transport.map

I realize as I write this I was hoping I'd get some MS/PC-DOS like 
behavior.

Grep has no option for "inplace editing".  In the back of my mind a
thought floats around that I saw something many years ago (real years not
Internet years :-) about how to do this.  I just can't nail it down.

Any ideas? 


Thanks,

      Programmers (and other creative artists) need version control
      systems to coordinate different contributors' work and to keep 
      track of all the different releases or versions of a project.  
      In recent years, many people in the Open Source community have 
      used Concurrent Version System (cvs) for this.  cvs works well,
      but it has a number of problems and limitations.  

      Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/) is a replacement
      to cvs which has most of cvs's features without some of the
      problems and limitations of cvs.

I'm not sure if one's really expected to run those Debian kernels in
server production.  I mean, they're stable, but they're really
conservatively configured.

I (and I think every other serious Debian user) use make-kpkg on a tarball
from kernel.org.  This launches the normal kernel configurator (config,
menuconfig, whatever you choose) and then makes the kernel into a standard
Debian package that can be installed on any machine with 'dpkg -i'.

Nope, doesn't answer your question.  The best advice is to compare the
configs, of course, but two have suggested that already.  I think  you'll
find the Debian config to be, as I wrote, extremely conservative.

I might *almost* suggest Knoppix as a pathway to Debian.  There are
a few places, like apt configuration, where it is not QUITE properly
set up as an installable distro, but I imagine a couple of days of
attention from a Debian guru would fix this.   Knoppix is handy to
test hardware for compatability and do initial setup from the Live
CD, then finishing off with apt-get over broadband for server
applications and the like. 

But again, that would take some modification of the CD image, which
I am too lazy to do.  It might be easier to do with a Live DVD,
without trying to jam it all into a compressed CD.

One other issue, for newbies, is documentation (or the lack of it).
There are a lot of books, and a lot of websites, that answer questions
for Fedora, fewer for the other distros.  With Debian you will have
to do a lot more teaching and explaining - you can't just sling a
stack of books at them.  But since nobody reads the documentation
anyway, maybe this is not a big difference.

I've already successfuly compiled both gphoto2 and libgphoto2 using the following command:
./compile --prefix=/usr/local

When I try to compile gtkam, it eventual dumps me out saying:
"checking for gtk+-2.0 libgphoto2 >= 2.1.4... Package gtk+-2.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `gtk+-2.0.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'gtk+-2.0' found

configure: error: Library requirements (gtk+-2.0 libgphoto2 >= 2.1.4) not met; consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if your libraries are in a nonstandard prefix so pkg-config can find them."


I can't seem to find 'gtk+-2.0.pc' anywhere.

Any ideas?

IMHO, distribution-patched kernels are wrong....

If you patch the kernel, it's with a patch that hasn't made it in to the
mainline kernel.  If it hasn't made it in to the mainline kernel, it
hasn't had as much testing or as many eyes looking at it.  As such, the
odds of a distribution-patched kernel being as stable and secure as a
vanilla kernel are, I think, lower.

I have been using perl-based Kwiki-Kwiki for a few wikis on my sites.
One of the features of Kwiki is "AnonymousGnome" - this is how you 
are identified until you set your preferences (which puts a cookie
on your machine).  A lot of people forget, and so you find lots of
pages written by "AnonymousGnome" and no way to contact the author.

You also can get wiki spam, which takes some administrator editing
to completely remove from the system.

So ... I am wondering about alternative wiki implementations, 
preferably with a login and (flimsy) password, to remind people
to login and to raise the bar for wiki spam.  I realize that this
is not in the anarchic spirit of most wikis, but nobody says it has
to be your real name, right?

What alternatives are people familiar with?  I would prefer Perl-based,
as I understand that better than Python, but if it is easy to install
and fairly full-featured, I will consider almost anything.

I wish this were true, but the fact is that Andrew Morton's -mm kernel 
series is the de facto testing ground for a large number of patches 
that make into mainline kernel. And I see that Alan Cox is once again 
releasing his -ac series. The -mm series is typically well tested, and 
I suspect the -ac series may once again regain that distinction if 
Alan rolls out releases consistently.

There's really too much kernel development for Linus to stay abreast 
of it all. He relies on folks like Andrew Morton to act as sort of 
Patch Lieutenants, who filter lots of code on its way to the mainline 
-- a path that can be slow, at times even glacial.

Rod,

Why not use perl to process your file?  You should be able to read you file
into an array in memory, do sort and "grep" type operations on it and write
it back out over the original file.

I have a situation where I need to grep -vif a file writing the results
back into the orginal file.  I'd _really_ rather not create a temporary to
do this and every trick I can think of doesn't work.

An example of the way I'm trying to avoid.

/bin/cat transport.lst | grep -vif no-imgate.lst > transport.map

With "relay_recipients.map" containing the final results.  I don't want to
create the "transport.lst" if at all possible.  Keep the hits on the disk
to a minimum.

Tricks like these _don't_ work.

grep -vif no-imgate.lst < transport.map > transport.map
cat transport.map | sort | grep -vif no-imgate.lst  > transport.map
cat transport.map | sort | grep -vif no-imgate.lst | sort > transport.map

I realize as I write this I was hoping I'd get some MS/PC-DOS like
behavior.

Grep has no option for "inplace editing".  In the back of my mind a
thought floats around that I saw something many years ago (real years not
Internet years :-) about how to do this.  I just can't nail it down.

Any ideas?


Thanks,
Rod

Take a look at mediawiki (I'm running one at ciscavate.org, with the
login setup you describe--feel free to play with it.) This is also the
wiki software behind wikipedia.  It is php based, but I think you'll
find php easy to deal with, if you ever need to get into the depts of
mediwiki source.

I can't stop saying good things about it, so I'll just stop talking :)

Why?  Is there not enough space?  The performance difference should be
negligible, and debugging and maintaining the script is *far* easier
when you can re-run it against the same file.

That said, if the file is small enough to fit in memory, you should be
able to do a "cat file1 | grep > file1".

Work safely,
  Aaron

It's apparently not an rpm.  The "rpm" in the name probably means it
makes use of features of an rpm-based system to install itsself. 
Filenames like this typically specify the OS, architecture, and system
information that this particular binary is built for.  In this case, 
an i586 machine running linux, whith rpm (so, probably Redhat,
Mandrake, or Fedora).
If you are running Debian for example, you may be better off with a
different package.  And if you're on some other architecture (such as
a mac) you'll need a different binary.

Most .bin files are binary executeables.  You can run "file
jre-1_5_0-linux-i586-rpm.bin" to confirm this, it may be a shell
script.  In either case, running: (at a terminal)

chmod a+x jre-1_5_0-linux-i586-rpm.bin
./jre-1_5_0-linux-i586-rpm.bin

should do it for you.

Or use a gui tool to set the executable bit, and then you can probably
double-click it.

Since there is .to and .cc, don't you think there should also be a .bcc

I'm a big fan of MoinMoin; it's what I'm using here:

starting to get a lot of spam.

No, but sed does.  If you want to remove lines matching a pattern, try
this:

sed -i -e '/PATTERN/d'

Of course, since you've got a list of patterns to match in
'no-imgate.lst', you'd probably rather use that than write out all the
patterns.  Something like this:

ARG=" -i "
for l in $(cat no-imgate.lst); do
  ARG="$ARG -e '/$l/d'"
done

sed $ARG transport.map

Most wiki software has anonymous editing by default.

Still likely to be a barrier for entry for some people who otherwise 
have something legitimate to contribute.

rpm -Uvh jre-*.rpm

The rpm philosophy is based on the idea of 100% hands-off 
installations -- which doesn't work with software that comes with a 
click-through license. Hence the .bin file: it's essentially a license 
wrapper around the rpm.

For those of you who haven't already seen an invitation to the upcoming 
ITEC convention next week, here is an invitation that can get you a 
ticket for free (if you wait til you're at the door it'll cost you $50).

A number of local open source businesses and consultants have been 
meeting for several months to put together a group called POSSE - 
Portland Open Source Software Entrepreneurs. We'll be staffing a booth 
at the show as one of our first official events. Hope to see you there.

I've been using TWiki at work, for the reasons you state above, except 
the SPAM problem.  My customer needed both revision control and login 
auth.  TWiki is perl based so is easy to follow the code or do updates. 
  Documentation is easy to follow and complete.

So, where does one go to read up on all the currently available top level 
domains? The few sites I checked in a Google search appear to be dated -- 
they have all the old standards, but don't mention .to or .cc, nor, I assume 
several others.

Writing the script in Perl would be a good idea. 
 
  BASH does support a memory array option.  I've used arrays in the past to
process large chunks of data without taking a disk hit.  

Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide: Chapter 26. Arrays
http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/arrays.html

  Another old server admin hack would be to create a RAM disk to hold your
temporary files.  Your system will still take a I/O hit when you access the
temp file, but it won't actually spin up the disk.

I'm surprised I have seen this one yet because it's awesome. Three
words.. 

Unbuntu ... Unbuntu ... Unbuntu ...

http://www.ubuntulinux.org/

Really one of the easiest installs I've ever done. Debian based with
modern up to date stable packages (based on testing, yet stable with
good work from the Ubuntu community). 1 iso for installation. The also
have a i386 live cd to tests.. 

http://www.ubuntulinux.org/download/

Warty is awesome. On my laptop and on my server. Unleash "universe" in
sources.list and there's not much you won't have available. Unleash
"restricted" and you have packages available for things like your nvidia
cards.  And Hoary (next release) is going to be even better. 

It matches every one of your requirements a - f 

Geeze.. that's sort of sounds like a commercial or something.

How does one use dump to create a tape backup with multiple

I ask because I tried this, which seemed obvious, but is wrong:

dump /
dump /usr
dump /home

and I ended up with a just a backup of /home.

Message-ID: <86pt1sfck5.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


Here's a puzzler:

I just updated the clock on a router (an OpenWRT'd Linksys WRT54G) and
apparently blew away a connection I had open through the router's
masquerading.  I am pretty sure that when I updated the clock (about 4
years) I caused the conntrack information to get expired, and so even
though both ends were still there and trying to talk, the router
didn't know how to connect them.  Does anyone know a way to poke the
conntrack information back into the conntrack table?  It would be a
bit of a pain, but by reconnecting to both the hosts, I think I could
determine the ports involved.

Use /dev/nstX instead of /dev/stX.  nstX is the non-rewinding tape
interface.  stX rewinds automatically when it's closed.

apt-cache showpkg kde

It's not part of the installation (thankfully ?!? ;) ) but all of it is
indeed in the repository. Warty's default install is gnome2.8..

For accuracy, Gentoo has nVidia's closed drivers in portage.

Does anyone know of software that will allow the simultaneous writing to 
multiple DVD burners?

Ideally, there would be one player, a hard disk and 3-10 writers (8x 
speed), so that I could make up to 10 copies at once. Copies could be made 
from the player or hard drive. Hopefully using only off the shelf PC hardware.

(This would NOT BE USED for copying Hollywood's stuff.)

Thanks

Nevermind.  I found it at OPB.ORG:

<http://stream.publicbroadcasting.net/production/mp3/opb/local-opb-455801.mp3>

It aired on November 22, evidently.

Russell,

   I heard this two Mondays ago on All Things Considered, but it was during
the local (OPB) segment each half-hour. The story line is that Portland has
become the international center for linux development but that means as much
to local folks as did Microsoft's presence in the Seattle area about 15
years ago. At this point I arrived at my destination and got out of the car
so I didn't hear the rest. It was broadcast Monday, 22 November.

The patched version of cdrecord that works on DVD recorders works fine
running many copies at once:

You'd just need to use the proper dev=X,Y,Z line on each one you run.

NPR is a network, not a station.  The local affiliate is Oregon Public 
Broadcasting, so you might check opb.org for it.  I heard the story, it 
talked about how Portland is the epicenter of Linux activity in North 
America and likely the world.  I believe it was on either Marketplace 
or Oregon Considered, and I can't remember which.

Howdy pluggers,

One of my editors wants a Solaris 10 review. I would either like to 
collaborate with a gen-yoo-wine Solaris guru, or just turn the whole thing 
over to said Solaris guru. It pays money and fame and your name in lights. 

This could lead to more paid writing gigs, if you prove worthy.

Contact me offlist. Thanks!

I haven't heard of any such software, but the simple method of running
3-10 cdrecord/growisofs processes would likely be simplest. As long as
you fire them all off close together (say within 10 seconds), the system
will take care of caching the source and avoid chewing the hard disk. The
problem will be getting a system with that number of controllers.

   I thought that SCSI busses can accommodate up to 15 devices. Would that
not be practical in this case?

Just curious,

You'd need additional IDE controllers (not too expensive)... but I'm not
sure if the PCI bus would be able to handle all that.  You might have to
go the 64-bit PCI route to move that much data.

I'm not sure it will be a problem, but I could see it causing issues...
especially with that much data being moved.

one of my favorite DNS usages has to be DJB's website:

cr.yp.to

At one point I wanted to venture out and try my own variation
of that theme, but decided I didn't want yet another domain
to manage.

how about dragonball.z? :)

Aha! It never occurred to me that someone local would use a domain from off 
shore. But, why not? The web doesn't care, so why should I?

I think the problem is that there aren't any consumer-level SCSI DVD
writers. The cheapest I've seen are still close to $1000, and can go
far above that.

Paul,

   Oh. OK. It's been so long since I bought my Plextor PlexWriter that I have
no idea how much I paid for it. I guess this need for burning disks in
parallel rather than serial is a one-off situation and not a continuing one.

Thanks,

Rich

Paul,

   After a quick google search I learn that this is not the case. Price
grabber has quite a selection, including a Plextor jukebox (didn't check
just how many drives are included) for $2,300. Single drives as low as $70.

Subject: [PLUG] SSH2: Restoring Passphrase Request
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0412040839510.17285@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Last time I asked about this I did a poor job so I didn't get a practical
answer. Let me try again.

   I use ssh2 rather than telnet to connect among machines. When connecting
from my notebook to my server/workstation I am no longer asked first for my
passphrase, but only for my password on the remote machine. That's fine here
in the office but I prefer to use the passphrase to log in when I'm away
from the office.

   On the target host, /etc/ssh/sshd_config has the lines:

#RSAAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile      .ssh/authorized_keys

HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key

PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitEmptyPasswords no

   In my ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file (on the target server/workstation) I
have entries for the other three hosts in linex that begin "ssh-dss ..."

   My questions are:

   1) Is the problem on the remote notebook host or the target
server/workstation host?

   2) Is the problem a missing public or private key on one side or the
other?

   3) How can I restore the passphrase request without rerunning ssh-keygen
on all hosts?

Thanks,

Rich

Can you provide a few example URLs? The only ones I was able to find
priced that low were DVD readers that listed support for the various
writable DVD formats.

if "restore permissions" on the backup server permit it (otherwise it

Why do you want to ping it?

Why not have it "not on the net" and then when it checks, 
it just starts the ethX and then shuts it down when finished?

It may be that, on either machine, your ~/.ssh directory and its files 
are group- or world-readable, which will cause ssh or sshd to ignore 
their contents.

If that's not the case, then, on the server, fire up sshd in 
test/debug mode on an alternate port:

   [root at server]# sshd -d -p 222

Then contact it from your notebook, also in debug mode:

   [rshepard at notebook]$ ssh -v -p 222 server

The problem ought to show up in one of the terminal sessions. If you 
can't spot it in your scrollback buffer, you might try launching the 
sessions using script(1) and then reviewing the resulting typescript 
files.

I just want to give some added feedback on this. I just installed Fedora 
for the first time (Fedora Core 3) and I was really impressed by the 
ease of installation. It autodetected all of my hardware correctly, the 
only thing I needed to do to configure X was pick a resolution.

I chose to use their default Gnome setup, and there was an icon right 
there in the top bar warning me that there were updates I needed to 
make. I ran up2date and it had to grab about 20-25 packages, but it went 
very smoothly, including upgrading the kernel RPM.

I think it was the smoothest Linux install I've ever done.

With the updates available that easily and the inclusion of SELinux, it 
seems good from a security standpoint as well, although I haven't poked 
at it much yet.

As a side note, I'm pretty amazed at how easy the installs have gotten 
in general. I'm sure that a lot of people take that for granted, it's 
what they expect out of an operating system, but when I think back to 
the old days of downloading floppy images, screwing around with X 
configs, and all of that, it's really something to see the progress that 
has been made.

Ya know... I'll agree with you that the progress has been made in the
installation. 

HOWEVER...

I'm really starting to get peaved about the way the GUI's are being setup.
It's becoming harder and harder to get everything "Just So", before they
come out with said patch and hose the system. GNOME, KDE... etc.

Personally I still prefer the resource hogging Enlightenment, but everybody
else seems content with a one size fits all KDE or GNOME setup. 

Familiarity breeds Contentment...
Contentment breeds ... well, ya know the rest

Oh, well. These are the times...

Well, I doubt I'm going to stick with the default setup :) I'm actually 
not a big fan of KDE or GNOME, but I think they are good choices for the 
average end user. I hear you about updates breaking things, though.

I think my favorite window manager is still Window Maker. Very clean and 
fast.

It sounds like it. That would be an alternate strategy, to set up a 
second, private network that the backups happen over. That would work if 
the boxes are all on the same network.

Keith, I can understand the paranoia about services running, you never 
want to do that if you don't need them, but in this kind of situation I 
would be more likely to run sshd on the backup server and just rsync 
through that from the clients when needed, rather than have all that 
polling going on. Yes, it's a service running that is a potential source 
of danger, but there haven't been many big problems with OpenSSH. I 
think that code is being scrutinized pretty closely, and if a problem is 
found you know there will be a patch coming quickly.

And as I think you hint at in your original email, the clients will have 
sshd running in the plan you propose, so if a hole in it crops up then 
the data is still vulnerable on the client boxes themselves. It's a 
problem you'll need to deal with in any case.

You could configure sshd so it only accepts connections from the client 
IPs, and set up redundant iptables rules to do the same things. I think 
that's a pretty secure setup.

One of the books I read a long time ago used the metaphor of a seesaw, 
with security on one end and convenience on the other. You always need 
to strike that balance based on your own situation, and the value of the 
data you need to protect.

The Cocos Islands is one of those tiny countries that decided to
capitalize on having its own gTLD during the Internet Gold Rush, as did
Tuvalu (.tv), Tongo (.to) and Micronesia (.fm), because as gTLDs they made
a bit of sense (to English speakers, at least).  I was, of course, too

The concept opens up all kinds of possibilities. Who knows? Someday, I might

I think your design is very interesting.  And not just in a Howard
Hughes germ-phobia kind of way.  But leaving yourself no way to nudge
the server if it nods off, or even maintain it serves as a sure
invitation for ol' Murphy's Law to have its way with it.
At, of course, the worst possible time.

SSH is pretty darn secure, especially if you disable passwords, use
DSA keys and restrict most keys to specific tasks and IP addresses.

And then you can have something with a simple, ordinary, maintainable
design that even your typical hung-over sleep-deprived self-taught
half-assed sysadmin can maintain and diagnose. (/me raises hand)

Bruce Schneier talks about balancing security against other factors;
security takes away from other things like functionality,
maintainability, reliability and simplicity.  So one looks for the
sweet spot while exploring alternatives (such as your backup system.)

Subject: [PLUG] System hangs
Message-ID: <200412041713.27408.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

From time to time my system hangs. It's usually when I have an xterm window 
open, along with KMail, and Patience, and then I try to open something else, 
like K3b. When I reset the machine and try running K3b (to burn CD's) as the 
only program I start myself, it works fine.

The system has 192 Mb of RAM (free -m says 186). It has been suggested to me 
that the problem might be a bad spot on the hard drive. I have begun testing, 
but now need advice on how to proceed.

Details:

I started out installing Debian Woody on this machine. I tried upgrading to 
Sarge, but could not get the install to work. I was given a SuSE 9.1 personal 
CD and installed that. However, I didn't notice if there was an option to 
tell the SuSE installer to wipe any partitions it found and do it's own 
thing, and as a result, I have three old ext2 partitions along with the 
reiserfs partition used by SuSE.

The partitioning looks like this, according to the lvm tool in YaST2:

/dev/hda1     /boot       92.0 MB Linux native
/dev/hda5      swap     180.0 MB Linux swap
/dev/hda6        /             3.7 GB Linux native
/dev/hda7                   957.3 MB Linux native
/dev/hda8                     47.6 MB Linux native
/dev/hda9                       2.8 GB Linux native

I have run badblocks on the three ext2 partitions, hda7, hda8, and hda9, and 
found no problems. Now I'm thinking about running badblocks on other 
partitions. I understand that a partition should not be mounted when 
badblocks is run, so I'm trying to figure out how to go about testing the 
swap partition. Should I make use of some of the old ext2 space and create 
another swap partition before proceeding?

Any recommendations on my next step would be appreciated.

How about USB writers?  Not sure if they're 1.1 or 2, which would
definitely make a difference in how many you could use, but USB can handle
many devices.  I've used a Plextor USB burner that works just great.  I
presume there are USB DVD burners too.

Failing on high demand can indicate RAM  failure.
Run memtest86.
The knoppix CD boots with this program as an option.

Just in case it's temperature, at reboot, go to your BIOS and examine CPU 
temp and fan speed.

In case it's static, put a note on your keyboard to always touch your PC 
metal case
or something grounded before touching keyboard or mouse.
Problem may go away.
Static gets to motherboards via these paths and locks up CPU.

Swapfile may be too small. Check the needs of your distribution for a 
server.
Swapfile takes a while to corrupt itself.
Run badblocks on swapfile too.
Do  swap off   first or assign another partition as swap.

I was a GNUstep/WMaker user for 5 years until recently, I wanted
to start using KDE just to get familiar with what non-savvy users
see the linux desktop as.

One major beef with WMaker is it doesn't seem to be developed 
anymore, and I had one irritating bug where if you set an app for
omnipresence, it would take 100% of the CPU.  This bug seemed to be
unresolved for years.

Message-ID: <1102236076.28483.12.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

My brother is working on a voice over IP attempt of his own using Java.

On a 11 mbps wifi network running into a 100 mb/s network we could talk
just fine.

Naturally the thought was to try and run it through our DSL.  He
expected blank spots maybe, there's a lot of static though.  I
guess there's a way to compress a 16 bit 44 kHz audio stream.  
Another option is to record a minute and require it to be 
buffered at the remote end before it plays back, but he wants 
to get as close to live conversation as possible.  It seems 
like a great piece of software, as is, for use over a lan
though.  It works over 10 mbps and faster connections.

What are the common ways of addressing random latency and
the sub lan speeds of broadband connections for voip 
deployment?  I hear rumors that cell phones modulate the
noise etc. and actually calculate on the fly how to tell
a remote cell phone how to reproduce your voice.  Apparently
on a cell phone, it's not your voice but a computer 
reproduction that's heard.

I am working on a translating project and want to harmonize spelling
across the document.  Right now I am looking at sorted lists of words,
but the misspellings (particularly of people and place names) aren't
necessarily adjacent and so a certain amount of concentration and luck
is involved in finding them.  I thought a phonetic sort order might
help.  Basically I am looking for a drop-in replacement to
/usr/bin/sort that sorts using the soundex algorithm (os something
similar).  Any pointers/ideas?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0412051739410.2698@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   When it rains, it pours. This afternoon my newest UPS (an APC Back-UPS Pro
650) shut down. It came back up, but the server needed a cold start. The
third time this happened I unplugged everything and replaced the 650 with a
Back-UPS 600 that was left from the former second workstation. So, I'm up
again.

   I suspect it's the battery in the unit (but my older ones are still doing
just fine), but I need to have the battery/unit tested and purchase a
replacement battery if that's the problem.

   Where can I go in the Portland area to get this tested and purchase a new
battery if necessary?

   Alternatively, might it be a better use of scarce funds to purchase a new,
higher capacity unit?

Thanks,

Rich

There's a Text::Soundex module on CPAN, though I've never used it...

I'd have a look through the Securing Debian Howto[1] I found it to have
lots of good information.

It sounds like you want to install kde without X which is possible in
Gentoo too. Have a look at USE flags[2] partically something like
"USE=-X"

No, you probably didn't do anything wrong.  KDE doesn't depend on an X
server (though xlibs were surely installed).  After all, your KDE-based
clients could run on a remote server.

There's a meta-package called x-window-system (I think) that should be
what you need.

As for a "guide", well, I don't know.  I just browse the repository and
get a feel for how it's structured and how the packages are divided up.

Theres tons of already developed programs for VOIP.
And theres tons of libraries that handle audio compression for near

I guess it would be helpful to know where do you want to go?  Are you
trying to build a server? Workstation? laptop? mythtv? Installing X can
be a bit tedious in Debian, however I like the fact that I haven't had
to install a new OS on my desktop or servers for over 3 years since I've
switched to Debian.....

This looked interesting....

You might be taking the manufacturer's ratings too seriously; a 600 or 650
VA unit should be able to handle three or four systems without problems. 
I wouldn't necessarily expect to an hour of runtime out of it, but it
should be adequate to survive a brown-out or shutdown in case of a
black-out.  My experience has been that the manufacturer's specs are for
bigger budgets than I generally work with.

Well, there's O'Reilly's Running Debian GNU/Linux, though it's a bit

Forgot to get x-window-system or x-window-system-core along with that.

This page is a just a link to the debian desktop users guide.  Its got 
some info on debian's packaging system in ch 11 I think.

Hope this is what you're looking for.

I am looking for a basic workstation, running kde and a few gnome apps.
I guess I was under the impression that you needed X to run kde. Maybe
debian isn't the way to go for me; but I have heard many good things
about it so I thought I'd give it a try.  I will be using the
workstation for daily tasks; EG. Playing video, mp3s, games,
web-browsing etc. - All the fun stuff :-)

I guess it would be helpful to know where do you want to go?  Are you
trying to build a server? Workstation? laptop? mythtv? Installing X can
be a bit tedious in Debian, however I like the fact that I haven't had
to install a new OS on my desktop or servers for over 3 years since I've
switched to Debian.....

This looked interesting....

I've found the Debian Reference to be handy.

  apt-get install debian-reference-en

(Assuming your preferred language is English. They have many other
translations available, too.)

Once installed, it can be read from a web browser using the URL:
  file:///usr/share/doc/Debian/reference/index.html

You can read it on-line at:

You'll probably want one of these apt-source lines to get mplayer then:

deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ stable main
deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ testing main
deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ unstable main

Wil,

   Thanks. I suspected that they were under-specified. I noticed on the APC
Web site that one can buy a replacement battery of greater capacity, but
they don't indicate by how much.

   I think there's a battery place on Belmont around 37th or so. Do you know
if they carry replacement batteries? I found a Web-based vendor that sells a
replacement for $31 (plus shipping) but I'd rather buy locally if possible.

I'd give them a call and see what they can do for you.  Also, doesn't
the APC unit have some sort of diagnostics?  If the unit is relatively
new, I'd be surprised if the battery is bad.

I ran memtest86 from the knoppix CD (thanks, Keith) last night. It ran for 
9:54 and some seconds, finishing 16 passes with no errors.

I forgot to do this after running memtest, so I'll make a note and check it 
later. The handful of times I've been there, I've never noticed a category 
for those things.

I used to have that problem with my other machine, but since I got rid of the 
leather topped steel table, it's no longer an issue.

Now that I have some unused partitions sitting around, I'll create another one 
and then test the old one. Having only prepared partitions automatically with 
OS installers, I'll have to go looking for the instructions on how to 
manually create a swap partition, as well as how to make some reiserfs 
partitions. 

I used the destructive badblocks test on the old ext2 partitions. Will the 
non-destructive test likely be enough to turn up a problem? Otherwise, I'll 
have to format(?) some of the unused space, transfer everything over to 
there, and then test the rest. 

Thanks for your ideas.

   "New" is relative. I'd guess it's 5 years old (+/-).

   Actually, when I replace the battery in this unit I'll probably replace
them in the other two UPSs, too.

You need the X libraries and other resources locally and you need an X
server _somewhere_, but not necessarily locally.  (The X server is the

Hey Rich...

I'd be careful about spending too much on a replacement battery.
I picked up a NEW APC, same size, for about $100.

That's about the age APC recommends that the batteries be replaced (or
maybe it's even 3 years?).  You can look at the serial number to determine
the date it was manufactured, at least on certain models: the last two
digits are MMYY.

Wil,

   Er, not on my BP650S. The serial number ends with "...2783". :-)

   Replacement battery ordered and on the way.

1. The swap file appears to be too small. This link describes swap space:
http://linux.about.com/od/linux101/l/blnewbie4_2_13.htm  
*Note that swapfile size is usually 1.5 to 2x the RAM size.*

Googling on: linux swapfile size 
will get you more info.

2. You seem to need info on partitions so you can manage them yourself.
Google on: fdisk parted linux magic druid cfdisk sfdisk 
to find many good links on partition management.
This link is informative:
http://www.linux.com/howtos/Multi-Disk-HOWTO-12.shtml 

3. Automated installation programs will do unpredictable things with partitions
such as using existing ones or not using them, or wiping them all out and 
repartitioning the drive in its own way. You may have such a situation too that
you will want to clean up.
The mount command will tell you what logical drives/partitions are mounted for use.

I hadn't noticed that in his original email, but you're right. I thought
the Fedora install warns you when you try to use a swap partition that's
smaller than the amount of memory?

To the original poster, I know there's a section in the old RH manual
about adding swap, it's here:

http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/custom-guide/s1-swap-adding.html

It all applies to Fedora too. If you've made a swap partition that's too
small you might just want to add a swap file. Those instructions are at
the bottom.

I'm not saying this is the cause of the problem you described, but it's
good to have enough swap in any case...

Whoops, confusing my lists :) Nevermind the stuff about Fedora, but those

Rich,

   It may well be. On my fiancee's ThinkPad I managed -- somehow -- to not
turn on the swap partition. She'd open 2 or 3 applications and they'd all
crash. As soon as I added the swap partition to /etc/fstab life was once
again good.

It's certainly possible. At least he has some swap space, so it's not as
bad as having none, but it's certainly something to correct in any case.

I've had similar problems to what he described for other reasons, like a
hard drive going bad. But fix it and then it can be ruled out at least,
that's the fun of troubleshooting :)

I have been unable to figure out just what is causing this.  I have

That's really odd. Something with the NIC maybe, like a driver problem?

Rod,

   I'm not at all sure I understand what you want to do. But, let me take a
wild stab at it.

   Read 'man mkisofs', then run it from the command line to make an image
that cdrecord (or it's successor whose name I forget just now; perhaps
cdrtools) can carefully lay down on a cd-r for you. You can feed mkisofs a
directory into which you have copied all that you want to preserve for
future generations.

Hi,
Thanks first to everyone for their suggestions about Versions to use. 
Will help several of my customers in their efforts to become
window-less.

I myself have three new versions to try over this winter( seems like
the best time to be stuck inside dinking with boxes)

Right now I have a wonderful install of Fedora Core 3 on the box and
everything appears to work except the internet connection.

KPPP dials in and connects but after that, nothing. No browsing, No
email, No traceroute, no pings off the local network. I'm not sure
why, but that's why I'm asking you all.

Any thoughts or suggestions?

I've already checked the KPPP site and discounted the two items that
appeared related. 

TIA,

Harry

Run /sbin/ifconfig and see if you've got a ppp interface with what 
appears to be a valid Internet address.

-> If so, a) does /etc/resolv.conf look kosher? b) what does "netstat
    -rn" show? can you ping the Gateway address? c) does running
    "/etc/init.d/iptables stop" help?

-> If not, look in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ and see if there's
    a file called ifcfg-ppp (or something very similar).

    -> If so, could you post the contents (remove any sensitive info)?

    -> If not, try using /usr/bin/system-config-network to configure
       your interface.

Ugh. There are too many if-then clauses in the troubleshooting 
steps...

Okay, I got this fixed by ifdown my nic and then dialing in, this 
allowed me to setup/get email and browse. Now the question is, what 
needs a fix so I can leave my nic up and dial in?

And yes, there are WAY to many if-then-else runs in troubleshooting. 
This is why only the insane and demented or extremely brave do Tech Support.

It's hard to say, it depends on what's causing the problem. I've never 
had to disable a NIC to have KPPP work. It's possible that it's 
something with the gateway, if you have a default gateway set up in the 
settings for the NIC.

All those suggestions Paul had are the right ones, you'll want to go 
through those steps. When it comes to things like the netstat -rn 
output, it would be interesting to compare what it looks like when 
things are not working to what it looks like when they are.

Try keeping the log window open in KPPP after the connection is made to see

At the typical normal shelf life of 5 to 10 years for a CDR, there won't

If I had to guess, I'd say that Rich hit the nail on the head. I 
haven't run a PPP interface in a looonnng time, but I bet your eth0 
interface remains the default gateway even after your ppp interface is 
activate.

To see if that's true,

1. Get your system into it's normal "just booted" state and run
    "/bin/netstat -rn" (or /sbin/route without arguments; they're
    functionally equivalent).

    Take note of any line that has a destination of 0.0.0.0. The second
    column ("Gateway") should display the route that sits between you
    and any non-local IP addresses.

2. Use kppp to dial your ISP. Once it connects, run "netstat -rn"
    again. If things are working correctly, the Gateway will have
    changed. If not, then a) the Gateway hasn't changed or b) there is
    no default gateway.

If the route has NOT changed, then try to see if any of your network 
settings set a static gateway device:

   grep GATEWAY \
     /etc/sysconfig/network \
     /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*

Note: /usr/share/doc/initscripts-*/sysconfig.txt describes in detail 
the options available to the files in /etc/sysconfig.

If there's a hard-coded GATEWAY or GATEWAYDEV in there somewhere, 
you'll probably need to get rid of it. Doing so might mean networking 
will be broken the next time you [re]plumb your interfaces, so be 
careful. :-)

Yeah, the real issue is how the box is networked. Is the ethernet card 
just for a local network, like private address space, and the PPP 
connection is to connect to the Internet? If so, then you don't actually 
need a default gateway associated with the NIC.

The default gateway is used to route packets destined for addresses that 
do not have a direct route already in the routing table. If the ethernet 
is just used for your local subnet, then there should already be a route 
in the routing table for that. It doesn't need to use the default 
gateway. The PPP connection, on the other hand, will use it a lot, for 
any traffic destined for the Internet.

My guess is that there is a default gateway configured for the NIC and 
that the PPP connection is not able to set a new one. If your setup is 
like I describe above, then the solution will be to remove the gateway 
for the NIC. That's probably what the system scripts did for you 
automatically when you shut down the interface.

I've just started using Fedora so I'm not sure, but there should be an 
easy GUI way to do that part. There should be some kind of network 
configuration tool in their Gnome menu. I'm in Windows right now, sorry, 
I can't be more specific... :)

If I may be so immodest:

Burning CDs on Linux
http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-cdburn.html

mkisofs -o test.iso -rv  V disk_label  /files-to-be-copied
cdrecord -v -eject speed=8 dev=0,1,0 test.iso 

It's an old article that does not cover the 2.6 kernel, but the mkisofs 
commands are the same.

Okay, it was a defined default gateway in one of the configuration files 
in sysconfig.
Once I set it to 0.0.0.0 and rebooted, all was Kosher, as they say.

Thanks to all of you. I'm very glad you are there when I have these

I just got my USB memory stick yesterday.

I want to put Linux on it.

Any of y'all running Linux on a memory stick?

Right now it's just loaded up with a bunch of Windows utilities like
AdAware and AVG.  I'd love to be able to run a little Linux distro on
there as well.

It another 450MB to go before it is filled, too.

Any suggestions for a distribution?  Thus far the only one I've seen
that looks promising is DSL.  I may, however, hack up INSERT instead...

I'd think that any linux that would run from a floppy should run from a 
USB stick although, I've not heard of a usb boot device before. Would be 
interesting to see a boot partition on a USB flash drive so that a 
server would need it to boot, sort of a security key. That way, if the 
server went to reboot without it, it would just hang until the "key" was 
put in.
It'd be interesting to play with and find out.

Cool, I'm glad you found a way to make it work :)

A slightly cleaner way would be to leave the entry blank, like:

GATEWAY=""

Or just comment the line out.

That way you're not setting a gateway at all for that device, as opposed 
to setting one of 0.0.0.0. When Paul mentioned that address it was 
because that's the destination that gets set for the gateway, it 
represents all other addresses not specified in the routing table.

 From a pratical standpoint it probably doesn't matter, it sounds like 
it's ok as it is :)

Debian will install on a stick.  Make sure it's plugged in when you boot 
the installer.

I think some (read: a rare few) recent (post-2002) boards can do it.  It 
would not surprise me at all to see this become a more common, possibly 
ubiquitous feature in the future as portable drive bays with USB and 
Firewire connections (allowing you to use a standard ATA or SATA disk 
as a portable disk), NVRAM USB keychains, and bajillion-in-one portable 
media readers become dirt cheap and ultra-ubiquitous and finally kill 
off the floppy dinosaur and slow-ass, relatively expensive CDRW and 
DVDRW markets.

Get a USB-bootable board and make it so.

Check out the root_plug module and patches to it by Fred Emmott.  I
don't think the system would be able to boot without the USB device
plugged in without whitelisting some applications.

Turned out to be more esoteric than that.

Rich, Carla.  Thanks for the input.  I've been there are done all that.  
The issue was I had two directories and their files and the standard 
mkisofs flattens them into one.  One directory has a links (with the 
same name) to files in the other.  Mkisofs doesn't like that too much.  I 
was also fighting the -R which kept smashing my very nice files names into 
8.3s.  Not very useful.

I did almost come up with a solution by dropping the -R butthere is no way 
to get -- that I can find -- two or more directories with their structure 
from a single command line call of mkisofs.

FWIW, this is for a bunch of Postfix servers and the configuration and 
scripts are almost identical.  It would be very nice to pull all the stuff 
off one and copy onto the others plus have a backup.  So I finally decided 
to scp to one system with a directory structure that takes into account 
each server and then create the CDROM from that.

Again thanks for the input.

I've got this old 486 laptop that im running the svga xserver on but I 
only get 8bpp color on it.  So I tried the xvesa driver and I can get 
16bpp color on it but I can't use the mouse. (It moves erratically) Can 
anyone point me to the file that I would need to edit to fix it?

Thanks!

I've spent a good portion of the 24 hours researching these things...

It turns out I made an incorrect assumption.  I assumed most of these
LiveCDs would be full of useful utilities to work on a system that
wouldn't otherwise boot.  Strangely enough, they're almost *all*
targetting traditional Desktop users as a full Desktop Distro On The Go.

Most of them don't even have simple things like nmap or clamav or
chkrootkit.

So... I'm going to work on porting INSERT over to USB key.  I've run in
to some strange problems.  Unfortunately, due to the nature of booting
from USB keys, I'm not sure if these problems are related to my USB key,
to my motherboard, or to the software/configuration I'm using.  :-\

Use the -graft-points option.

Suppose your directories are html1 and html2.

mkisofs -R -o temp.iso -graft-points dir1=html1 dir2=html2

Mount temp.iso and see if that's what you want:
mount -t iso9660 -o loop temp.iso /mnt/cdrom

I really like this CD, it's designed specifically for system rescue:

http://www.sysresccd.org/index.en.php

The ISO is 110MB and it has a ton of tools, I believe it has all the 
ones you mentioned. I found it from the ntfsresize page, it has QTParted 
on it.

I have no idea if it would be possible to make it work on a USB device 
somehow instead of a CD :) But if you need a good rescue CD, I really 
recommend it.

Message-ID: <20041208205522.79987.qmail@web50602.mail.yahoo.com>

I have XP, Fedora, and FreeBSD installed on the
computer I usually use. Recently I decided to change
the display adapter, and then I booted each OS to
check the consequences.

Windows default to 640 x 480 without a new driver. I
installed the new driver and increased the resolution
to 1280 x 1024.

FreeBSD initially boots into a console, unless you
mess with it. I ran Xorg -configure, and then it
booted into 1400 x 1050, actually slightly
overclocked.

And then Fedora. Kudzu appeared, as expected, but then
it uninstalled the mouse! And the sound card! And the
TV card! There wasn't anything left! (Nothing? The HD
was still going, obviously.) Assuming that I want to
save this installation, what is the procedure to
follow? (I have a backup, but since the problem is due
to a hardware change, this approach presumably won't work.)

I'll take a look at it.  It uses the knoppix cloop design, so it should
be relatively easy to port it over to a USB stick.

Cool. If you get it working with the USB stick let us know.

Thanks, those were both helpful. Armed with what I read in them, I understood 
better what YaST's partitioning tool wanted.

First, with only an xterm window open, I turned off swapping with

swapoff -a

Then, I started up YaST. My only gripe with this tool is that, once it's main 
window is open, it doesn't give any indication that it is loading a secondary 
widow, so when I started up the partitioner, and it took 30-35 seconds before 
another window opened, I thought it wasn't working. It only took me three 
tries to figure it out, and it was only because something interrupted  me on 
the third that I found out it really was working!

There were various warnings about not changing partitions that are mounted, 
etc., but since I was working on the last three partitions, and they were not 
mounted, I forged ahead.

After deleting hda7, hda8, and hda9, I created a new hda7 at 384 Mb, 2 times 
my memory size, and set it to be my swap partition. Then, I created hda8 to 
use up the remainder. 

Two things went wrong. I'm not sure why, but the size I called for didn't 
stick, and I ended up with a swap partition that was only 192 Mb -- not much 
better than when I started. The other was that I missed seeing that the mount 
point for hda8 was /usr. So, when I finished, there were lots of commands 
that were not found, and when I tried to su to root, the locale was missing. 
Actually, I saw that it was going to use /usr, but it didn't register as a 
problem. I logged out and then back in as root on a terminal screen 
(<ctrl><alt><F1>), umounted /usr, and found the missing stuff. Then, I 
created /usr2, edited /etc/fstab to change the mount point for /dev/hda8, and 
then logged back in using X. I ran YaST again, redid the creation of hda7 and 
hda8, as above, double checking the size, and making sure hda8 used /usr2 for 
a mount point. Everything appears to have worked.

As I type, I have an xterm window open, along with patience, kmail, and k3b. 
That's the situation that gave me trouble before. Seems fine, now.

The only thing I'm not sure of is if I need to do anything with the old swap 
partition. It's sitting between the boot partition and my original main 
partition. It's not all that big, and I now have another 3.something Gb of 
additional ordinary space, so I suppose there's no problem with just leaving 
it there. It is no longer referenced in /etc/fstab, so I'm assuming it will 
just look like an unused spot in the partition table that happens to be 
formatted as linux-swap.

Thanks, again, for the pointers to the documentation.

Let me try this with a little more information.  I'm running xfree 
server 3.3.6 on a deli linux distro running kernel 2.2.26. (This is just 
a play/internet surfing laptop)  I can get the vesa server running with 
an external ps/2 mouse, with no trouble with the mouse.  The built in 
mouse is one of those funky side mount trackball style mice.  Under the 
svga server the ps/2 protocol with /dev/psaux mouse style works great.  
I thought that the vesa server used the same mouse but it doesn't work 
for me on the xvesa server.  As I said before it jumps all around.  I 
know that its rare that anyone is running a mouse like this but if 
anyone has any insight as to where I should begin my hunt it would be great.

Thanks.

Aaron

If I understand correctly, you have "/path1_to/dir1/" and "/path2_to/dir2",
and you want to create a CD with "/dir1" and "/dir2".  You need to use
"graft-points" option for mkisofs(8). 


  # mkisofs -R -J -V some_vol_name -o /path_to/cdimage.iso \
       -graft-points dir1=/path1_to/dir1  dir2=/path2_to/dir2

  # cdrecord -v -eject /path_to_cdimage.iso

I tried this but incorrectly.  This is exactly what I'm trying to do.  If
the eye lids weren't so heavy I'd try right now but instead will wait for 
tomorrow AM when mistakes are less likely.

I was missing the dir= portion when I tried.

Again thanks to both of you.

Hi Richard,

That sounds like an adventure :) I'm glad it seems the problem is fixed.

You can leave the old swap partition there, it's not a problem, but you 
might as well put it in fstab. The system can use multiple swap 
partitions and swap files. I believe it will try to access the first 
entry in fstab first, that one gets the higher priority, so you could 
enter the old one second and the system would only use it if needed.

If you have access to a copy of Partition Magic you could delete it and 
expand one of the other paritions to use that space.

Good point. I suppose that I could have made the new swap partition smaller 
and just had them split by a normal partition. I'll just add the old one 
after the new one in fstab. I see that the new one has a priority of 42. 
While that's the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and 
everything (from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), I don't know the 
significance in this situation. Is there something special about the number? 
In other words, if I make the priority of the old swap partition 43, is that 
good enough?

I think I could do that with parted, too, but I feel a little uneasy moving 
the beginning of the next partition. I understand moving the end of a 
partition, since there's nothing of significance sitting out there. But, 
without understanding more about how these things work, I would wonder about 
moving the beginning of a partition, where lots of important stuff sits. I 
had thought about copying all the stuff to the other new large partition, 
then deleting both the old swap partition and then trying to add it to the 
old large partition, but for the amount of space, I'm not too concerned. 
Maybe I should do that, though. Now's the time, before I start using the new 
partition.

The other question I had was just what to do with the new partition? It 
occurred to me that what I should do is to pick something, like /usr, copy 
all of it to the new partition, rename things so the new partition is /usr, 
and then delete the old /usr directory. The next question is which part of 
the tree makes the most sense to give 3.something Gb of space? Maybe it 
should be /home, since I'm expecting to have a bunch of photo images, and 
they'd be stored in my home directory. Any recommendations along this line 
would also be appreciated.

Thanks again for your help.

I think I had this all screwed up :) Take a look at the man pages:

man swapon
man 2 swapon

Especially the second one. It says higher numbers mean higher priority. 
If the priority is the same they will both be used round-robin.

I don't think the order in the fstab matters.

I don't think you can even move the beginning with parted if the 
filesystem is ext2 or ext3, that is one of it's limitations. You can 
only move the end point when you resize, if I'm reading the docs correctly.

Well, it always makes sense to give /home it's own partition. That way 
if you decided to install a new Linux from scratch, you could skip 
formatting that partition, mount it back at /home, and all your data 
would still be there.

On multiuser boxes /var can end up being an area that grows a lot, with 
things like mail spools and logs, but it sounds like /home might be 
better for you. You can always steal some of that space later if you 
need it elsewhere.

Update:

I just got my modified INSERT running!  I finally discovered syslinux
just *wasn't* worth the hassle so I installed GRUB.  I moved things
around so GRUB could find them, booted with GRUB, discovered it couldn't
find the config file, came up with a custom "install" line, got grub
installed on the stick...

AND BAM!  IT WORKED!

So, from start to finish, I downloaded the INSERT CD and mounted it
loopback... I copied everything from it to the USB stick, modified the
init scripts inside the initrd (miniroot.gz) to load USB modules (might
not have been necessary), hardcoded the location of the cloop file
(might not have been necessary), installed grub, booted to the grub
console, reinstalled grub... and it works.

The process should be identical for virtually any of the knoppix/cloop
clones out there.  Anything cloop based should be able to use that
approximate process to become USB bootable.

I'm going to hopefully clean it up a little bit over the weekend and
write up some real documentation on it.

Thanks.

Here's what I now have for those in fstab:

/dev/hda7        swap       swap       pri=42            0 0
/dev/hda5        swap       swap       pri=41            0 0

After running swapon -a, here's what cat /proc/swaps says:

Filename                        Type            Size       Used    Priority
/dev/hda7                      partition       393552  7800    -1
/dev/hda5                      partition       184708  0          41

Now I can be a swapping fool! Well, the fool part may not be any different 
from normal, but I probably have more than enough room for working with lots 
of pictures at the same time.

That probably explains why I didn't understand how it could be done!

That makes sense, especially the part where I can keep all my old stuff if I 
reinstall someday. /home it is.

Message-ID: <1102624208.5850.27.camel@hermes.braithwaites.net>

That's right! You can get that magic piece of paper really cheap from
Free Geek.

Free Geek is going to offer the Linux Professional Institute
(http://www.lpi.org/) Linux 101/102 Certification exam on Sunday, Jan
23, 2005 at 1:00pm.

Of course, you might be interested in cramming for this exam in advance,
so we will be organizing cram sessions in advance in the evenings. These
won't be classes, per se, but will instead focus on going over the
subject areas covered in some of the different training materials and
sharing each other's knowledge in advance of the test.

In keeping with the Free Geek tradition of trying to make technology
available to everyone, we have worked out a very special deal with LPI
on the test's pricing so we only need to charge $40 for the exam.

Because we have to let LPI know a few weeks in advance how many people
are going to take the test (there are _very_ rigid rules around taking
the test), we need you to sign up right away.

We can give the test to up to 35 people, so we will sign up the first 35
people to contact Laurel Hoyt (ideath at freegeek.org), the Free Geek
Education Coordinator, with a cut-off date of 31 Dec 2004. Once we hit
the cutoff number or date, that's it.

I have a hunch that this will fill up quickly, so please don't wait.

Actually, it is the third Wednesday, which this month is the 15th.

We have so many fewer problems like this if we all just agree to adopt
the French Revolutionary Calendar that had three 10 day weeks per
month, with extra non-month days tacked on the end near the vernal
equinox to pad things out.  

Just to clarify, this month's talk will be given on:

I am personally trying to wean myself from the French Revolutionary
Calendar. The whole "extra non-month days" thing has always felt like
a kludge to me.

Now that we're starting to move to 64 bits, I think that UNIX epoch
time is a much better solution in the long-run.

Eric, you know we never start on time. At 1103166000 we'll still be
ordering beer and resolving this month's problems with the projector.
The talk is much more likely to start someplace between 1103166900
and 1103167200.

Message-ID: <41B9E7B1.2000404@ahapala.net>

I've had varied success using text files to keep my notes in. I'm 
wondering if a better solution couldn't be implemented. I could write a 
LAMP solution or I could use a wiki or a notes app.

I guess my goals are:

- have categories
- keep track of each entry or change by date so that I can reference 
everything by date (i.e. what the h*ll did I do last week :-) )
- web oriented (with auth) might be nice so that I could be anywhere and 
search/update it
- I'm partial to a SQL db backend, as it would give better odds for 
dumping and importing into some other software in the future.

Maybe a private wiki would be the best way.

I'm sure many of you have already tackled this. What are you using and why?

CRM Software may be what you're after:

  Sugar CRM
  XRMS

There are others. Once you've setup your contacts (may be imported from
SQL or comma delimited file), you may quickly add activities that are
aligned with each respective contact. 

I think one of the nicest things about CRM software is that you can
easily see the activities for a particular contact listed simply by
selecting it. This means that you can tell at a glance progress with a
particular client. 

We find CRM a great tool for making sure we stay on top of client
requests and projects.

Of course, these applications are web based have the capability for
exporting their data in standard formats.

And for those who want something a little more desktop application
oriented, something to just take fast, linked, formated and powerful
notes. Tomboy is a dream come true and extremely powerful if you have
used wikis in the past.

Message-ID: <B0003188832@bct-mail.bctonline.com>

I'm getting strange behavior from a Logitech mouse I just purchased and
installed.

 

mouse  -->  KVM Switch  -->  systems

 

Win-XP  -  mouse works ok

RedHat-9  -  mouse works ok after bootup, but not after switching to another
system and then switching back.

 

strange behavior:

the pointer jumps erratically around the screen and is only fleetingly
visible, usually when it activates a screen.

 

tried several mouse selections (both logitech and generic) using
redhat-config-mouse.  got the same results on all.

 

switched out the logitech for a mouse that came with an e-machines system
and problems went away.

 

If I can't get the Logitech to work, I'll have to replace it.  Not sure what
to get.

 

Please advise.

I get this with several systems I manage. I'm usually forced to "reboot" 
the mouse by unplugging it from the KVM.

This is NOT recommended, and you can fry your mouse this way.

Having said that, I can also say I have never fried a mouse myself this way.

Oh, and it happens with Windows, Linux, Solaris, and HP-UX...

Coop,

Those would be good choices if I was making notes for clients or people. 
I'm thinking more about notes for myself. I tend to find myself looking 
into a certain software project, and then having to drop it for a period 
of time. When I come back to it I have to re-learn some of what I 
learned before. Up until now I've tried to keep text file notes on these 
projects but it seems cumbersome.

Aaron,

   That looks like a nice bit of software. I'll have to compile the 
tarball and check it out. I especially like where it is going in terms 
of integrating with Evolution. This could be the ticket.

   I use a trackball rather than a mouse. FWIW, I have had no problems with
Kensington Orbit trackballs on my 2-port LinkSys KVM. The old trackball
finally wore out and I replaced it with the spare from the former second
workstation. Unplugged the old, plugged in the new and continued working.

   So, while this is not a direct fix for the immediate problem, it's an
option for future consideration.

If anyone ever finds a KVM that works flawlessly switching between
windoze and Linux, and doesn't produce ghost images on your monitors
please let me know.

I'm partial to wikis since they allow me (or anyone else) to go back and 
learn about what I've already figured out and subsequently forgotten.  
It also allows other people to contribute their knowledge as well.

To that end, feel free to piggyback on my wiki at the URL below if you 
don't mind it being public.

In the past I've run multiple xservers and used fullscreen vnc.  Not
ideal for gaming / user-intensive activities, but it works for many
things (and it's cheap!)

Bryan,

   Can't comment about winduhs and linux as we don't use the former at all.
However, when I first installed the LinkSys KVM and fired up the second
workstation I had very annoying ghosts and color shifts. These persisted
even with the second workstation shut down.

   A couple of sets of _very_ high quality (and equally expensive) cables [1]
fixed the problem. No ghosts, color shifts or any other eyeball-bending
displays.

HTH,

Rich

The KVM in question is a Belkin Omniview Pro 8-Port.
It's never had any problems until I started using the LogiTech mouse.
Make me wonder what the LogiTech is doing...
Is it possible to monitor the mouse data stream?

I have similar problem at work with a Dell Mouse which is made
by Logitech as well.  My KVM switch is Hawking (at work).  I want to blame 
is on my
KVM switch because I don't have the same problem
with the same mouse at home.  I am using a Linksys KVM switch.
And I am running various distros at home and work (I have redhat, fedora and 
solaris x86)

I found something weird and not sure if that helps in your case or not.
I found that the way I bend the cable to connect between KVM to my box
makes some difference.  So sometimes I would be able to fix the problem by
yanking on the cable back and forth....

Just wondering about the logic behind that.. I've never heard of anyone 
saying "don't unplug your mouse with the computer on."

I don't see how you can fry a mouse by unplugging it. Please enlighten.

Thanks :)

Right now I'm going the vnc route and it works well enough.

I have been successfully using a Lynksys KVM-2KIT to switch between two 
vintage 1999/2000 machines one running Linux and the other running Win98. 
Have had no problems with it.

I bought it at Pacific Solutions, on SE Powell near Foster. When I was 
shopping for it, I was looking for simple and cheap, and considered a 
mechanical switch unit. I mentioned that I had a 19" monitor, and was 
cautioned against a mechanical unit, as they did not play well with large 
monitors. Since it wasn't that much more for the all electronic Linksys unit, 
I went with that, and have been pleased. Just double click the Scroll Lock 
key and bounce back and fourth all day.

I don't know about a KVM... but you *can* damage a motherboard by
unplugging a PS/2 port "live" ... I don't understand fully the *why* of
it, only that it *can* happen.

It used to be this way. 
However nowdays MB don't have these issues with reconnecting
mouse or a KB on running computer. 
I do this all the time at work.

I bet you're right :)
I think it falls into the realm of AT vs ATX style motherboards. I still 
hear people saying that you should leave an ATX case plugged in while 
working on it, for the sake of grounding.
This only applies to old AT cases. Probably the same applies to our 
frying mouse/keyboard issue.

Straying from the topic of KVMs...

There's also the fact that since PS/2 isn't hot-pluggable, most OSes won't
notice if one is plugged in.  USB, OTOH, is hot-pluggable and (in a modern
distro at least) automatically recognized and configured.  For about
$8+S&H you can buy a USB device that allows you to connect a PS/2 keyboard
& mouse as USB: http://www.electronicsoutfitter.com/store/USB630A.html.  I
just got the Compaq branded one at Office Depot (for $20, because I didn't
want to wait and I wanted to be able to easily return it if it didn't
work) and it works fine.

I downloaded this, and tried to configure it:

Their website says:

"Tomboy is currently in pre-release development, but you can still try 
it out. Tomboy is written in C# and utilizes the Mono runtime and Gtk#. 
Automatic spell-checking is provided by GtkSpell."

Mono.. hrm.
su-2.05b# cat /usr/ports/lang/mono/pkg-plist |grep mcs
bin/gmcs
bin/mcs

Well there it is.

su-2.05b# pkg_add -r mono
Fetching 
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5.2.1-release/Latest/mono.tbz..

Oh, that also means it needs: /usr/ports/x11-toolkits/gtk-sharp
or `pkg_add -r gtk-sharp` :)

Someone should make a freebsd port of this tomboy.

In-Reply-To: <41BB4F8A.5010300@schluting.com>
Message-ID: <OMEBINHFEBMFOKIAIEADCEJJDFAA.bl.nordlund@verizon.net>

I am trying to run Netgear's Media Server Software, which streams MP3's to
the MP101 media player (like a stereo component).  I have my MP3 files on a
dedicated server running Mandrake and Samba.  I have had the directories and
files shared for a couple years, using various windows applications to play
the files across the network.

Netgear's server application is supposed to scan the directories you point
it at and build a library database of all the MP3's found, then stream the
files to the player across the network.  The problem is the scanning
process.  The software claims that file access has been denied so it imports
nothing into the database.

Are there additional selections under Linux other than giving the user,
group, and others read and write rights?  Do the rights set under Linux not
necessarily translate into the Samba server?  Under the Samba settings, I
show my public directory is shared and browseable.  Also, public and guest
access is enabled and writeable.

Any pointers would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Brian.

Yes and no - the same can be said of IDE cables.  I've hot-swapped IDE
drives before without problems.  That doesn't mean it's safe.

PS/2 wasn't designed to be hot-swapped, so you run the risk of doing
damage to things if you *DO* hot swap them.

ACKKK!!  NO, NO, NO!

Static is NO LESS of a problem now than it was then.  Leaving the case
plugged in *will* help ground it, and if you keep in contact with the
case at all times, you'll be grounded... greatly reducing the chances of
some ESD damage.

Additionally, it's possible the system itself could build up a small
static charge... so if you are grounded and it is not (ie; the cable is
unplugged) *it* could discharge static to *you* - which does the same
damage.

Just be careful working around inside computers, especially when it's
dry outside.  Better safe than sorry.

However, if there is no external power switch, then leaving the power
cord connected will mean that the ATX motherboard is still being
powered.  Connect/disconnecting devices/cables to the motherboard
while the motherboard is powered is not recommended.

The PS/2 specification was not designed with hot plugging in mind. It's 
live, and has little to no protection for the controller chips behind it.

If you unplug the mouse, you risk the mouse, the ps/2 controller, and in 
some cases, the motherboard. If you unplug the keyboard, you risk the 
keyboard, the keyboard controller and the motherboard.

When you risk the motherboard, you risk everything that's plugged into 
it...

Unexpected use can produce unexpected results.

Tomboy rocks!  Thanks for posting this software Aaron.  I was also

Subject: [PLUG] Mpeg video editing software.
Message-ID: <41BDC9FA.2090608@dimstar.net>

I'm embarking on a new project. I have two ReplayTVs with network 
connectivity. Though DVArchive, I can easily connect to these DVRs, and 
download the mpegs from the replay to my linux/windows PC. (Also runs on 
Mac... don't have that...)

What I'm looking for is something that will allow me to easily edit the 
mpeg, once it's on my pc. I've looked at Kino, cinelerra, and a couple 
others. Most of the sites I find on the net are Windows centric.

Does anyone else do this? What do you use?

I'm mostly looking for something I can load up the file in, and then cut 
and/or paste sections of the file. The file could be 1.9 gigs (one hour 
show) up to 5.2 gigs (2.5 hour show) to start. Ability to visually see 
what I'm doing (GUI) is a plus... It's darn hard to find sections of 
video to cut in text mode... :)

Thanks!

Subject: [PLUG] all (Windows) files filled with nulls
Message-ID: <20041212183343.GP20917@merlot.com>

My neighbor had a strange Windog problem, and after backing up his home
directory to a CD and reinstalling Windows, I found that the files in
his home directory were all filled with nulls.

I've never seen this before; the files all had the right names and
reasonable sizes, but their content was just gone. 

The original problem was that almost all text was gone; icon labels,
menus, email, everything except window titles. Clicking twice under an
icon on the desktop showed a stripe all the way across the screen with
the icon's label centered in the stripe. This is a 1400x1050 LCD on a
laptop, so we're talking about a long stripe. 

Since the drive is a 2.5" and I had to use an untested adapter to
connect it to a desktop to back up the home directory, is it possible
that the adapter somehow caused the data to be replaced with nulls? I
can't imagine how this could happen, but I'm not much of a PC hardware
guy.

TIA.

I couldn't get him to leave Windows (I blame Knoppix, which crashed on
boot), but I did get him to switch to Mozilla and Thunderbird. #:)

Subject: [PLUG] Shutting down without a monitor
Message-ID: <200412130824.40677.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

It's power outage season. Yesterday, as probably happened to one or two other 
folks, the power went out and stayed out for just over an hour. I have a 
battery backup for my two machines, but since I'm running both of them on one 
battery, I don't have my monitor plugged into it. So, when the power went 
off, the machines continued to run, but without a monitor, I couldn't use the 
mouse to initiate a shutdown. I waited a minute or so, since this had 
happened earlier, and power was restored within a few seconds, but this time 
it stayed off. When that happens, I shut down the machines. Without a 
monitor, I know what to do for my Win98 machine: <ctrl><alt><del> <tab> <tab> 
<enter> will cause Windows to go through a shut down process and power off 
the box.

Is there a similar sequence I can use for Linux?

What I did yesterday was <ctl><alt><F1>, login as root, and give the halt 
command, typing carefully so as to avoid typos. This successfully shut down 
the machine, but I had a few problems starting up again. For instance, kmail 
refused to load, saying that only one instance was permitted, and that one 
was running as pid 6xxx, according to a lock file. I deleted the lock file 
and kmail came up just fine. The other odd thing was that I had to start the 
machine twice before I could communicate over my network.

So, what I'm looking for is the proper way to initiate a shutdown that will 
cause all running programs to close in a controlled way, as if I had closed 
each one as I normally would. I've read the man page on shutdown, and it 
looks like that's what I should have used instead of halt, but I still would 
have had to switch to a terminal screen, and I'll need to make myself a note 
to remind myself of the proper command line. Does this look right?

shutdown -t now -h

The man page mentions that <ctrl><alt><del> can be used if there is an 
appropriate entry in /etc/inittab, but that one still has to be at a terminal 
screen since the "magic keys" are captured by X and "Some X11 environments 
make it possible to capture CTRL-ALT-DEL, but what exactly is done with that 
event depends on that environment."

I'm using KDE. Is there a place in that environment to set up a handler for 
<ctrl><alt><del>?

Thanks for any ideas.

Dick,

   Don't use KDE so I don't know if it responds to the ctrl-alt-backspace
chord that kills X when xfce is the desktop/window manager. Try that
some time when you can see what's happening. If it works, that's the first
thing I'd do. It should shut down all the GUI apps as X goes away.

   Next, I would 'su' to get a root prompt. You should see hard drive light
activity as a root shell is loaded. Then type either 'halt' or 'shutdown -h
now'. The first is a synonym for the latter. the syntax for 'shutdown'
requires either a '-h' (for halt) or '-r' (for reboot) and a time to
actually shut down. If your system is configured for power off when shut
down, then you'll hear the hard drive spin down and the power light go off.
Otherwise, wait for hard drive activity light to go off, press the power
switch until the system croaks and go have a beer.

You could have avoided the kmail issues by issuing an `init 3` (assuming 
RedHat SysV init style) to close X before doing your shutdown.


Does your battery backup not have a serial interface to allow power monitoring
and automated shutdown management?

If you have recent PC and kernel, you can get ACPI support to work. By
"recent" I don't mean super-modern, I have ACPI working on a
3-years-old motherboard with 2.4.26 kernel. You may have to figure out
how to configure it after it's working, but at least on Fedora Core 1,
out of the box, pressing the power button initiates the shutdown.

Otherwise, the easiest is probably to do Ctrl-Alt-F1, Ctrl-Alt-Delete
(this initiates reboot) and then wait for the sign that PC is booting
up (usually it'll beep when it's POSTing) and power it off.

I is published!  I are an awther!

See http://www.samag.com/documents/s=9464/sam0501b/ for the first
of three articles in Sys Admin about dirvish, the disk-to-disk backup
program I presented at the PLUG meeting last March.  Our very own
Hal Pomeranz was there, tech editor for the magazine, and after far
too much drama (at my end) he extracted these articles from me.  It
even paid a little money!

So get those presentations ready for PLUG;  fame and fortune await you!

The rest of you yokels, buy every copy of the January 2005 Sys Admin
you can find.  When I start my own religion (like Scientology - I'll
call it FOSSology), those magazines will be worth thousands.  :-)

As a fellow awther, howzabout slipping me a few "review" copies? Yeah, that's

Kino is the best as long as it does what you need, but you have to
convert movies to DV first, it only edits DV files. Cinelerra can do
everything and then some, but learning curve is very steep, and
interface is rather counterintutive.

   I don't do any of this, but the December 2004 issue of Linux Journal
features "Making Movies with Kino". Perhaps that will help.

Works fine. The only thing I now have to complain
about is that when I attempt command-line printing,
which I rarely do

>lpr filename

>lpr: lp: unknown printer

The printer is actually called "hp." Does it need an
alias or something?

Tim,

   I usually specify the printer on the command line. Use the name by which
CUPS knows it. For example, in my case I'll use,

lpr -P laser5_duplex <filename>

   and this tells CUPS to use the postscript module and duplexer in the laser
printer.

HTH,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] Slackware Specific: Learning Why rc.local Does Not Run
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0412130633260.21453@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This is a new one on me. When the UPS battery failed and I rebooted the
system I learned that the processes, applications and drivers in rc.local do
not load. I cannot be sure that it is called at the end of the boot process,
but it has been (and is) on every other system, so I assume that it is.

   The driver for my tape drive doesn't load automatically during boot so I
put that line in rc.local, but the driver is still not loaded. gpm, httpd,
smb and a few more applications that should be loaded because /etc/rc.d/rc.*
are present and executable.

   The SCSI tape driver, sym53c8xx.o.gz, is uncommented in
/etc/rc.d/rc.modules and apparently shows up in dmesg:

sym53c895-0: rev 0x1 on pci bus 0 device 5 function 0 irq 11

sym53c895-0-<4,*>: FAST-20 WIDE SCSI 40.0 MB/s (50.0 ns, offset 15)

But, until I manually load the driver no backups are done.

   In /etc/rc.d/rc.M (the multiuser init script) samba and gpm are called:

# Start Samba (a file/print server for Win95/NT machines).
# Samba can be started in /etc/inetd.conf instead.
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.samba ]; then
   . /etc/rc.d/rc.samba start
fi

# Start the GPM mouse server:
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.gpm ]; then
   . /etc/rc.d/rc.gpm start
fi

But, they don't fire up. Manual intervention is needed. Same with the
postgresql backend.

   However, many other services _do_ initialize and load properly.

   Is there a way (/var/log/messages shows me nothing meaningful) to
determinne the source of this problem and fix it? My replacement UPS battery
is scheduled to arrive today so I'd like to have the system boot properly
when I shut it down to swap UPS boxes.

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] all (Windows) files filled with nulls

My neighbor had a strange Windog problem, and after backing up his home
directory to a CD and reinstalling Windows, I found that the files in
his home directory were all filled with nulls.

I've never seen this before; the files all had the right names and
reasonable sizes, but their content was just gone. 

The original problem was that almost all text was gone; icon labels,
menus, email, everything except window titles. Clicking twice under an
icon on the desktop showed a stripe all the way across the screen with
the icon's label centered in the stripe. This is a 1400x1050 LCD on a
laptop, so we're talking about a long stripe. 

Since the drive is a 2.5" and I had to use an untested adapter to
connect it to a desktop to back up the home directory, is it possible
that the adapter somehow caused the data to be replaced with nulls? I
can't imagine how this could happen, but I'm not much of a PC hardware
guy.

TIA.

I couldn't get him to leave Windows (I blame Knoppix, which crashed on
boot), but I did get him to switch to Mozilla and Thunderbird. #:)

Done.  PoOr MUG has an entry.

It will be interesting to watch this grow should it take hold and
actually move forward.  Seems like Pittsburgh needs an entry given
they are actually meeting tonight ;)  Raise a mug at the MUG meeting!

That does indeed close all running X apps, but it brings up the X login 
screen. That is good enough, though, since I can continue from there and do 
what I did before, <ctrl><alt><F1>, login as root, and type halt at the 
command prompt that, even though I can't see it, I know is there.

I didn't think of that. I did think of telinit 6, since I've used that before, 
but that would have restarted the machine. I suppose it would have done the 
same things init 3 would have done regarding X. I think the idea Rich 
suggested gets me to where I want to be.

No, I got the cheap model.

My motherboard is from around 1998, and even though I'm using the 2.6 kernel, 
I don't think that idea works, unless there's a setting I could change. I 
accidentally hit the power button when reaching for the reset button a week 
or two ago, and the machine powered down.

Yes, that should work; I do hear the POST beeps on reboot. While it might be 
slightly quicker, the process outlined above gets me to a powered down state, 
and the note stuck to the side of the monitor is pretty short.

Thanks for all your ideas. Now, I'm ready for the next power outage.

I see used rack stuff from time to time at:

1) Tektronix RAMS surplus store (open thursday aftn)
2) Wacky Willies
3) Cascade Surplus

None are guaranteed to have what you want, but Cascade is moving,
and Wacky Willies has moved everything from Aloha to their NW Portland
store, so both are motivated to sell anything as big as a rack really
really cheap.

New?  Dunno.

Brave man.  I use c-a-F1, then c-a-DEL.  Though now that I have ACPId
installed on my box, I can just hit the power button.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0412140837170.2487@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   In OpenOffice.org-1.1.3 I find ctrl-x, ctrl-c and ctrl-v do not work, but
the functions do work from the menu. What I find is that ctrl-x seems to
move the cursor up, ctrl-c does nothing and ctrl-v moves the cursor to the
end of the file. Those are similar to keystroke commands in emacs, joe and
LyX. When I check in the Tool->Configuration dialog box I see function names
associated with menu items, but no key short-cuts.

   There is no place in 'qtconfig' where the keystroke behavior could be
changed.

   Has anyone else experienced this or has a thought on what broke?

TIA,

Rich

   But, when I close that small window they are not sorted in the bookmarks

Here are some possibilities that occur to me:

1) your window manager is intercepting them

2) OO.org isn't recognizing Control_L or Control_R as a control key

Paul,

   Interesting theories. This one leaks water because the same ctrl-x, -c, -v
hotkeys work in LyX which is also a qt-widgeted application running on the
same instance of Xfce.

> 2) OO.org isn't recognizing Control_L or Control_R as a control key

   Now this might be; I have only a left Ctrl key on my mini-keyboard. But,
wait! OO.o recognizes ctrl-s to save, ctrl-o to open and ctrl-n for new.
Well, I guess this isn't it, either. Darn!

Thanks,

Rich

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Portable Linux Enthusiast,

EmperorLinux Inc. announces our newest ultra-mobile Linux workstation.
The Kiwi T1x0, based on the Sony VAIO T140, T150 T160, or T170, comes
pre-configured with Linux:  http://www.EmperorLinux.com/mfgr/sony/kiwi
The Kiwi T1 is the first 3-pound Linux machine to break the XGA barrier
with an amazingly bright 1280x768 wide-aspect LCD (10.6").  X runs this
LCD in the full native mode.  It is packed with additional features,
including Firewire, WiFi a/b/g, and DVD-RW burner. Configurations start
under $2400.

This new Kiwi follows in the footsteps of the original Kiwi systems
based on the Sony Picturebook C1VP and C1MW.  It is still just larger
that a VHS tape, smaller than most O'Reilly books (10.7"x8.1"x1.1"), and
highly Linux compatible.

EmperorLinux has certified the Kiwi T150 for Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise,
Debian, Slackware, and SuSE.  Full hardware support under all these
Linux distributions is made possible by the "empkernel", the custom
built Linux kernel for laptops from EmperorLinux.  Of course the system
can also be configured dual-boot Linux/Windows with a shared data
partition if required.

The Kiwi T150 comes well equipped for the portable power user:
         - 1.1 GHz Pentium-M 733 CPU w/2MB cache
         - 512 - 1024 MB RAM
         - 40 GB hard drive
         - 1280x768, 10.6" wide-aspect, X-Bright LCD
         - CDRW-DVD or DVD-RW drive

This wide range of hardware specifications makes the Kiwi a perfect
match for anyone wanting a super-slim, ultra-lite Linux workstation.
Customers in academia and the corporate sector, as well as students and
hobbyists can find a Kiwi to fit their needs.

The Kiwi T150 has full Linux support for:
         - X @ 1280x768, 24bpp, i855gm (w/"xrandr" and external VGA)
         - Internal 10/100 land-line ethernet (RJ-45) (eepro100)
         - Internal 802.11 a/b/g WiFi ethernet 11-54Mbps (ipw2200)
         - USB 2.0 (memory keys, mice, floppies, keyboards, ...)
         - IEEE1394 FireWire (external hard drives, DV cameras,...)
         - CardBus cards (WiFi, modem, SCSI, ...)
         - ACPI Hibernate (via swsusp)

Complete Kiwi specifications, accessories, pricing, and availability
are listed on our web-site: http://www.EmperorLinux.com/mfgr/sony/kiwi

Feel free to call or email if you need a full quote, have any technical
questions, or are ready to place an order.  We can talk about the
hardware support and capabilities of the system, and various accessories
too.  Our technical staff will happily discuss with you what _you_ need
from a Linux ultra-portable.

I made weekly trips to cascade surplus and wacky willies for a while 
looking for a rack, neither had any that met my needs and/or were prices 
that I wanted to pay - you may have better luck if you're just looking 
for components of a rack.

I did have excellent luck on portland.craigslist.org though - I found a 
complete rack for a fraction of new price and for much less than what 
cascade surplus or wacky willies were saying.

An update?

Which version of Firefox are you running?

I don't have any Tool menu with my Bookmarks -> Manage Bookmarks

The only thing that comes close is the View option and that is for that
window only. If you want to sort (Alpha A-Z only) just open the menu.. right
click and select "sort by name".

I'm using Firefox version 1.0 on suse 9.0 personal edition. I went to 
Bookmarks -> Manage bookmarks. I found that I was able to cut, paste and 
generally edit bookmarks. To sort, I had to first click on one of the 
entries in the desired folder, then right-click and select "Sort by 
Name". I've exited the browser, and restarted it, bookmark changes are 
permanent.

This looks very handy, but its dependencies are a nightmare.  I fixed
the spec file by including the following dependencies:

BuildRequires:  gtk-sharp-devel
BuildRequires:  mono
Requires:     mono

However, I seem to have hit an impasse.  The configure script calls
"pkg-config --cflags gnome-sharp", which fails since there is no
/usr/lib/pkgconfig/gnome-sharp.pc file.  The /usr/lib/gnome-sharp.dll
file exists as part of the gtk-sharp package, but the .pc file is not
present in the gtk-sharp-devel package.

My best friend for such things, Google, has not come through for me:

http://www.google.com/search?q=gnome-sharp.pc

For those of you who have Tomboy working, where does the
/usr/lib/pkgconfig/gnome-sharp.pc file come from?

Thanks,

I looked at this too and it turned out to be too much of a pain for me 
to get it working under FC3. I could find various packages from 
different maintainers for things like mono and gtk-sharp, but not one 
unified set of packages that satified all the dependencies. I even found 
a Tomboy package in one repository, but the dependency packages were not 
there.

Looks like there is a testing package for FC2 but nothing for FC3. 
Perhaps when the extras show up on fedora.us it will be there...

If you do figure it all out, let me know :) It looks like a cool piece 
of software.

I presume you've checked Dag's unified, soon-to-be-RPMForge repository? It
looks like both mono and gtk-sharp (and -devel) packages are there. (FYI,
I've got a local mirror of the FC3 and EL3 repos:
http://haus.nakedape.cc/ftp/pub/dag/).  You should also be able to use FC2
packages with impunity; there haven't been any major libc or compiler
changes between the two.

I was using the Dag RPMs for RHEL 3, but the Dag version is fairly
old.  I suspect that the older version is the source of the problem
and I've been working on getting gtk-sharp 1.0.4 built from the
original sources to see.

Yeah, I did try his packages, but there were various problems. If I 
remember right I finally got all the things Tomboy needed installed but 
then it wouldn't build. Dag's mono package is for a very old version, 
it's like 0.3x when version 1.x has been out for a while.

I can't even remember all the things I tried and the problems I ran 
into, there were a lot :) But the gist is that I was not able to find 
one unified set of packages that worked together and satisfied all the 
dependencies. Perhaps I missed something, I don't know.

I will be there with little tiny projector, and recently acquired
Big Mother Screen.  BMS will require that the projector table be a
little farther back than before.  Maybe this time I will remember to
bring a power strip and a 3-wire extension cord.

BMS and other tools may take two trips to the car, or require some
native bearers if I can't find nearby parking.

Randal:  I can take HD15 (preferred) or SVideo.

   This brings up a question that's been on my mind for a while. Why hasn't
the price of LCD projectors dropped tremendously? Computers, hard drives,
RAM, digital cameras, printers and all sorts of computing hardware have
decreased by orders of magnitude over the past few years. Why not the LCD
projectors?

They have dropped - except for the price of the bulb, which often is
$400 or more. Until a new lighting source is perfected (perhaps
lithographed displays on cloth?), the price isn't going to drop much
more.

Ron,

   Oh, my. I'm surprised no one's seen this as a business opportunity. I've
no time -- or inclination -- to pursue why the bulbs are so expensive, but
it seems odd to me because these projectors are used in "home theaters" as
well as businesses so the market for an inexpensive unit should be very
large.

Thanks for the insight,

Rich

Remember that old Proxima 2810 that Zot had, that we tried to use at A.T.
a couple of years ago?  That 640x480 piece of [fertilizer] cost $7,495
new in 1997.  The Infocus LP70 I will be bringing is 1024x768 for
$1,895 new (I bought it for less than half of that, used).   The
new unit is smaller, much easier to use and more versatile, and
makes a much better picture, 4 times as bright.  

The downside IS the bulbs - the 300 lumen bulbs for the old projector
are close to standard overhead projector bulbs, and cost $30 or so,
lasting about 500 hours.  The 1200 lumen bulbs for the new projector
are $500, very specialized, and are claimed to last 3000 hours.  The
cost per lumen-hour is about the same.  There are outfits that will
rebuild these lamp assemblies for $200 or so.

Why the high price?  Part of it is that you are buying a whole specialized
assembly, with lots of extra pieces and a lower volume.  The justification
is probably that handling the inner bulb directly is likely to damage it.
The inner bulb is a real high tech affair, containing an extremely small
and extremely bright arc lamp, requiring exotic chemistry and a special
and highly tuned ballast to get the long lifetime.  There is a LOT more
science in there than in the old overhead projector bulbs.  

That said, T.I., the makers of the DLP micro-mirror display that forms
the core of my unit, realizes that the high cost of lamps means their
is less money for DLPs.  So they've put together a working group of
manufacturers to define some standard bulbs and cages, hoping to reduce
the costs greatly:

http://www.dlp.com/images/downloads/RPTV_Lamp_Working_Group_21April2004.pdf

When the lamp is standardized, the volumes are high, and multiple
manufacturers make them, you can expect costs of lamps to plummet.  
That, and other improvements in the projectors, may drop the price
of a unit similar to my own down to $1K in a year or so.  My inside
sources say that InFocus is really struggling to make a profit on
these little guys.  The innards come from a dozen different countries
on four continents.

At the end of the day, though, the reason why these units cost so much
is that the typical customer will pay that much for better and better
units.  The higher lumen, higher resolution units still cost $50K for
7700 lumens at 1600x1200.  Such units are used in concert halls and
arenas.  The biggest displays are made by AdVan over in Vancouver,
which is a wall of arrayed projectors (12 or so?) mounted in a truck. 
Bright, hyper-high resolution displays that work in the Big Blue Room.
Perhaps we can get Steve Hix to loan us one for an Advanced Picnic
next summer. :-)

Now, it's been my belief for some time that all this talk about HDTV and
those fancy new plasma screens is moot because the REAL trend is going to
be toward a multimedia PC (that will eventually foil any DRM attempt) and
a decent projector (being more portable and having, to some extent,
variable screen size).

Does anybody know the power consumption of one of these projectors?  I
imagine it takes a whole lot of juice to throw 1200 lumens and that
doesn't even include the electronics and such.  How does it compare with a
big plasma screen?  To a CRT?

Yeah, that just means the price is going to skyrocket unless they can
figure out how to produce these things in all in one place before fuel
prices go through the roof.

What I do on my headless Debian box is setup the keys Alt-UpArrow to 
halt the machine.  This is similar to the Ctrl-Atl-Del keypress.  You 
will need to be at the Linux console.  This is done by adding to 
/etc/inittab:

Keith,

   Taking nothing away from Carla's well-deserved rush of pride (mine's still
a few months away), there's another "Linux Cookbook" out there. Written by
Michael Stutz and published by No-Starch Press, it also pops up in a google
search for the title. Gotta' be more selective in search terms.

And both are published by O'Reilly (No-Starch is owned by O'Reilly).  
Perhaps this is the start of a trend - next year, O'Reilly may have dozens
of Linux Cookbooks, the year after that, thousands.  To help all these
Linux Cookbook authors, I propose writing the "Linux Cookbook Cookbook".
Of course, I will focus on using GNU/Linux tools to write these books,
so that will make it the "GNU/Linux Linux Cookbook Cookbook".  Urk...  :-)

One of the better places to look for books, BTW, is www.addall.com .  This
is a meta-search-engine for purchasing books online, with approximate
prices including shipping.

Better than buying directly from O'Reilly with a User Group discount?

Yes.  For Carla's book, the O'R UG discount is 20%, while the Walmart
and Amazon discount is 40%, and the shipping is cheaper.  The discount
differs depending on the item, of course.  Addall also checks for
remaindered and used copies;  I have bought recent books for 5% of new,
the cost dominated by normal shipping charges.  

The addall project seems to be very much the same spirit as FOSS, except
applied to shopping for books and other media.  I think they even use a
Linux server.

chaz,

   I suppose it would do quite well, as far as it goes. But, it does not do
tax preparation and electronic submission which is a large part of the
accountant's work. I think that's the major hangup.

The Fedora Project is officially launching Fedora Pre-Extras, to work
alongside Fedora Core 3 for i386 and x86_64 based platforms.

What is Pre-Extras?
It is our way of showing you that we've been working hard, as many
packages have been built, and are ready for distribution.

We are working very hard to make the build system work well, and the
infrastructure for this is almost ready, it just has a few kinks that we
are ironing out. As a measure of good faith, CVS for both Core and
Extras has already been opened.

While waiting for Extras to officially launch, use Pre-Extras today!

Where did all these packages come from?
These were packages from the now-merged Fedora.us repository as well as
freshrpms.net repository. So they maintain the same high quality
standards that was imposed previously.

So how do I get it?
Pre-Extras is currently hosted on the FedoraProject.org website, and is
available at:

	http://fedoraproject.org/pre-extras/3/

It is available as a YUM repository, and an entry like the following
would suffice (in /etc/yum.conf):

[pre-extras]
name=Pre Extras
baseurl=http://fedoraproject.org/pre-extras/3/$basearch/
gpgcheck=1

There is a temporary Pre Extras GPG key, which all packages are signed
with. The fingerprint:

pub  1024D/1AC70CE6 2004-12-14 Fedora Pre Extras Release 
<pre-extras at fedoraproject.org>
      Key fingerprint = 5389 DD00 C5BC 5168 12B4  3272 82ED 9504 1AC7 0CE6
sub  1024g/4E1A9D43 2004-12-14

To import the key:
	
  rpm --import 
http://fedoraproject.org/pre-extras/RPM-GPG-KEY-Fedora-Pre-Extras

What about bugs?
If you find bugs in the packages, report them at the Fedora Extras
Bugzilla:

	http://bugzilla.redhat.com/beta/

A cautionary note...
To paraphrase a Fedora Project contributor, Jef Spaleta, these packages
could eat babies; that is to say, they are built, signed, and ready for
use, but they have not gone through the rigorous QA testing that would
be expected normally from Extras. So if they break, submit a bug report,
but there are no implied warranties or guarantees that they will work.
Use these packages at your own risk!

About 2 years ago another group decided it was time to get a projector
and went for a $3K budget. They got a projector that was quite a bit
larger than Keith's (imagine a 4 inch thick laptop), but still did
1024x768, produced 2000 lumens and had a lot of image adjustments
(notably zoom and keystone). Figure that with a 10 foot image it is
visible even with florescent lights directly above the screen (washed
out, but visible).

Appears 1000 lumens is now the standard, and the brighter projectors are
fairly common at this point. Other nice bit is that DLPs have a *much*
better response time than LCDs.

I believe some 4000 lumen projectors can be had for less than $10K.
Another reason the high end projectors cost so much is they have 3 DLPs
rather than the single DLP of the low end projectors. DLP panels are
*very* expensive, yet because they can respond so fast, it is reasonable
to use a color wheel and flicker a single panel in synch with the wheel,
rather than having 3 panels (wrap your head around that one!).

Plasma the real problem is severe burn in, the two advantages are they're
relatively cheap for large sizes and look great. Thing is projection LCDs
and DLPs don't don't burn in and they can do quite large. At this point
it looks like gas plasma is dying out, though it is going to take several
years before you can't buy them anymore.

I think 1000 lumen projectors run less than 350 watts. I think the 2000
lumen projector was 550 watts or so. I don't have numbers for the others,
but I believe that is similar to plasma screens of comparable size. No
idea about CRTs (then again do you really want to battle with burn in and
tremendous weight of a rear-projection CRT?).

Google should provide the answer, Texas Instruments's "Digital Light
Processor". The first commercial MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System)
device on the market. It is a piece of silicon with an array of tiny
mirrors on it. The major trick is building something which moves the
mirrors around on a piece of silicon. There have been plenty of
laboratory experiments moving things around merely with static charges,
but few of those ever reached commercial production. The only other
commercial MEMS device I've seen mention of is sensors on some airbags.

DLPs are quite expensive (I heard nearly $1K for a single 1280x1024
panel), but move very fast (at a previous PLUG meeting I asked Keith
Packard whether it was possible to make one operate at 600Hz, and his
answer was yes). The one downfall is they are strictly small reflective
devices. You cannot make a direct-view DLP, nor can you make one that you
shine light through.

I gave up.  The pkgconfig files that were missing from the Dag RPM
version of gtk-sharp were found in a later release.  However, even
with much prodding I could not get a stable environment built.  The
gtk-sharp 1.04 compile would work sometimes, and other times would
give a Java NullPointerException from the cryptography library.  This
is with an identical rpm spec, just re-running rpmbuild.  :(

Even after getting a "successful" build, when I would compile Tomboy
the mcs compiler would choke on additional mystery missing components:

At this point I decided that it's simply too much effort to get this

I've attached my .spec files for the updated gtk-sharp package and
Tomboy.

I was going to ask if this is something unique to Debian, or if it is 
available across various distributions. Then, I realized that I should look 
at /sbin, to confirm that I have shutdown, and also look in /etc/inittab to 
see if there is some hint in there about handling special keyboard 
combinations. Here's what I have:

# special keyboard request (Alt-UpArrow)
# look into the kbd-0.90 docs for this
kb::kbrequest:/bin/echo "Keyboard Request -- edit /etc/inittab to let this 
work."

So, I could just replace the sample I have with what you use, and have the 
same capability, except that I'd still have to be at a terminal screen, where 
it does indeed work, even if not logged in, so I'd still have to log in. But, 
I wouldn't have had to shut down X first, so it reduces the process by a 
step.

Thanks for sharing this technique.

O Great Pluggers,

A guaranteed way to generate a heated discussion is to say "But I like 
ReiserFS." 'Cause then you'll get all kinds of folks claiming that Reiser 
broke and ate their data. Which may be true, I dunno, because none of these 
have been able to explain how they knew it was a defective filesystem, and 
not a dying hard drive, or power problems, or flakey memory, or a worm or 
virus, or a weirdo application.... you get the idea.

So how can you tell when it's the filesystem corrupting your data, and not 
something else?

Not to cast aspersions on any particular filesystem (I am agnostic),
does it matter what is actually "at fault"?  Surely, a filesystem
ought to try to be robust against failure it can't control.  In other
words, doesn't a filesystem share liability for allowing catastrophic
failure to result from foreseeable substrate failures?  It is kind of
lame to just point out that something else wasn't perfect.

(Speaking completely in generalities)

SO, when do we get you alone for a book signing?
Makes those First editions worth extra ya know.
I'm STILL waiting to get my camel book signed.

Good luck with the book Carla, I know it's no easy task to get to this

Luck and I will also miss your column in Bits as well.

Here's how I tell:

1) Identify that corruption is taking place

$ dd if=/dev/random of=/path/to/file/on/broken/filesystem bs=1024k count=10

Adjust count as needed.  Generally I've found that if things are bad
enough even a new small file will be corrupted.

$ md5sum (or cksum) /path/to/file/on/broken/filesystem
<some value>
$ md5sum (or cksum) /path/to/file/on/broken/filesystem
<a different value>

2) Isolate it to the filesystem

$ umount /path
$ md5sum (or cksum) /dev/<device for broken filesystem>
<some value>
$ md5sum (or cksum) /dev/<device for broken filesystem>
<same value>

If the checksums on an unmounted device differ, then you have a
problem with your hardware.  (I've only seen this happen with bad RAID
controllers, usually JBOD devices either work or shoot out I/O
errors.)

Other things that indicate filesystem-level troubles can be found via
"fsck", but most filesystems recover well from these minor glitches. 
Lots of these problems can indicate filesystem corruption.

   Do we need to wait for spring before you head west for a book signing over

I just did this. (Today...)

I followed the instructions in the upgrade file, which got 3.0.2 installed.

Then I watched my incoming mail for a short time. Long enough to 
determine that spamc/spamd weren't doing anything... Looking at top, I 
see 5 spamd processes just spinning.

So, I looked for some links.

I found this: http://www.akadia.com/services/postfix_spamassassin.html

I also had a rule file (/etc/mail/spamassassin/10_local_report.cf) with 
a bunch of rules that didn't pass when I ran 'spamassassin --lint'.

So I ended up going through the website above to reconfigure 
spamassassin and postfix to work with the new SA.

Upgrading my bayes database ended up being as easy as sa-learn --sync, 
but I'm not sure it's using that database... SA is now running as it's 
own user, so I think I'm using a global bayes database.

Not entirely painless, but it appears to be working now. It took about 
two hours to do all of it.

Actually, Russell, I misunderstood the original message I received.

It turns out that an associate is giving away these Hayes modems.
They're not fast but they are solid. I will dig up the details if anyone

Hello all,

Does anyone know of a limit in either apache or DNS(bind 9) for a
large amount of sites?  I'm looking at 250+ websites and wanted to
know if there is a problem or limit to hosting that many sites on one
server.

Thanks,

Not precisely the answer you were looking for, but there are three things
I dislike about ReiserFS in its current state:

1> There is no dump program. Saying that GNU tar works, while mostly
true, is not an acceptable answer. True dump programs tend to work much
better than tar can. This may be less of a concern to some folks, it is
not acceptable for my main systems. This is a fatal weakness for me.

2> They cannot mount read-only. I've been led to believe ext3 behaves
similarly, but if I tell the filesystem to mount read-only, failing to
mount is acceptable but silently replaying the journal is not. Given how
the filesystem works (they cannot mount an unclean filesystem), this is
an understandable decision, but I'd far rather they obey read-only and
provide a mode for journal playback-only. I find this disgusting, but not
a fatal flaw.

3> As Russell Senior mentioned, filesystems should deal with some
hardware funkyness. I tend to make very sure I've got working hardware,
but failures do occur. ReiserFS is a bit fragile (but *very* fast, you
determine the tradeoff).


> So how can you tell when it's the filesystem corrupting your data, and not 
> something else?

Steve Bonds gave some good starting points. Hardware can be very sneaky
on occasion though. The one I've seen was the Conner 1060 (I think it was
Conner, might of been another manufacturer) drives. They had a firmware
bug that ext2 was somehow able to tickle (they fixed it, but you had to
figure out that it wasn't ext2's fault). Those drives would of easily
passed Steve's tests, swapping to them worked fine, MinixFS worked fine,
UFS worked fine, but somehow ext2 caused the drives to go wacky.

Funky error messages with no apparent cause can be a sign of hardware
problems.

Hi Josh,

There's not a limit on a number of sites, no. You can host 250+ web 
sites all on the same box using Apache and Bind, I've done it before. 
The kind of performance you'll get will depend on the hardware you use, 
and also the needs of the sites themselves (how much traffic, are they 
running a lot of code, etc.)

You likely already know this, but ssl sites can't used name-based
virtual hosting, and instead must use ip-based virtual hosting.

I seem to recall that there is a maximum of 255 virtual interfaces
configurable on one real interface using Linux ip-aliasing.

Subject: [PLUG] Authenticating Linux systems to MS AD using Kerberos
Message-ID: <9e0a35780412171616256ee500@mail.gmail.com>

If you have a Microsoft AD controller and you'd like to authenticate
your Linux systems to it, here's a simple way:

These instructions are taken from a RedHat box so some things might be
different for other distros:

Edit /etc/krb5.conf and change all the domain/realm info to your
company's values.  Make sure these are in capital letters because the
connection will fail for some stupid Microsoft reason if not.  The
"kdc" line is your AD controller.

Next, edit /etc/pam.d/system-auth to include this line after the auth
line with pam_env.so:
auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_krb5.so

And change the auth line for pam_unix.so to this:
auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_unix.so likeauth nullok use_first_pass

You need to make sure the Linux box and the AD controller have
approximately the same time or else the Kerberos authentication will
fail.  Use ntp or rdate or whatever to keep them in sync.

Now all that you need on the Linux box is the account name.  The
password you supply will be the password stored in AD.

Not quite 100% accurate... I'm doing name-based virtual hosting for both
http and https at the moment... but all the https sites must use the
same crypto information.

See:  https://mail.axpr.net
and:  https://imp.axpr.net

...for an example.

Keith Lostrom's comment about Carla's new book is a bit ironic, considering
that in the copy of SysAdmin that arrived at my house today, he has an
article about dirvish, which covers some of the ground of the talk he gave
to PLUG back in March of this year.

He also recounts how he came to be the maintainer of dirvish -- which
could have been come into his hands in a much gentler way for all involved.
(For example, the original author did not bother with commenting his
code, a task Keith is now undertaking.)

But unlike Carla, I doubt he'll tell us to buy multiple copies of the
January 2005 issue: made the same amount of money from this article whether
SysAdmin sells 10,000 copies or 10.

Those sites return:

"Unable to verify the identity of localhost as a trusted site. Please
notify the site's webmaster about this problem."

So you can do it, but only in a broken fashion.

Actually, if memory severs me right, he did JOKINGLY, tell us all to buy
10 copies of SysAdmin.....

You must have missed his announcement the other day.   Someone else
please confirm my memory...

I didn't see where Carla told anyone to buy 10 copies..
I saw asking for book signing...

I would like both my SysAdmin and Carla signed.  When the are rich and
famous, I can brag that I knew them.......

Yes.  As I understand it, an HTTPS connection is encrypted from the
getgo, before any HTTP information is sent, so Apache can't know what
host you're looking for until after the SSL key is sent to the client,
which identifies the server.  The server identifies itself before the
client identifies what server it is looking for.

It *IS*, however, still SSL encrypted.  The certificate is no good, but
you otherwise enjoy all the other benefits of an SSL encrypted
connection.

Which is not 100% accurate.  You can't use name-based virtual hosting
with SSL without each site sharing the same SSL key.  It works, but is
not ideal.

And of course, there are others of us that are published on a frequent
basis as well.

Including my "everything old is new again" "Perls of Wisdom" from
Apress.  It just got to me, so I presume it' also orderable or in

Anyway, it's excruciatingly slow.  I mean, bytes per second.

What gives?  I don't know enough about smb to even know where to check.

This almost certainly won't help but it's a easy thing to check. Try
mounting with a CIFS file system instead of an SMBFS file system. CIFS
is Microsoft's replacement for the SMB protocol. You can use
'mount -t cifs' or 'mount.cifs'. See mount.cifs(8) for details.

The other thing you can do is try some other protocols for transferring
data and see how they do. For example from the Windows box you could
connect back to the Linux box with FTP or HTTP and transfer some large
files. That will tell you if it's a general networking problem or
something specific to the Windows file share.

How are your ping statistics?

Also, not every site is going to want/need SSL. In my experience working 
for web hosting companies, most do not. So, the limit Stafford mentioned 
could be stretched to host many more than 255 sites, since most would 
not need their own IP.

As for the issue with certs, I think it depends a lot on what you're 
doing. If the SSL is for someone doing e-commerce, then I think you want 
to have everything working without any messages that might scare someone 
away. If you're talking about having SSL to protect the logins for the 
users to access their admin area, webmail, etc., then maybe you can get 
away with what Rob describes. You might even be able to coach users to 
install the key for the CA in their browser so there's no error.

Most of the situations I've been in used name based virtual hosting for 
the mass of customers, and then had a specific box with SSL capability 
for those who needed it.

I don't think I've ever hosted more than 255 sites on a Linux box, 
actually, but I'm sure it's doable. I've seen FreeBSD boxes handle 
400-500 sites with suitable hardware.

If all you need to do is pass otherwise useless authentication info 
like web-only usernames and passwords, it's worth investigating digest 
authentication.

Basic authentication, the standard web-auth technique, is insecure; 
it's no more than base64-encoded plaintext.

Digest authentication is considerably more secure; it's based on an 
MD5-encoded response to a one-time nonce.

Apache and most modern browsers support digest authentication; it's 
definitely worth a look-see.

<frustrated-grumble>

   My headless SPARC doesn't a good entropy pool; there are no
   pseudo-random X events, and the network and disk drivers I use don't
   collect entropy either.

   All of which means that Apache hangs after a reboot if I've enabled
   mod_digest.

   Sparc/Linux needs a better set of entropy-gathering drivers.

Google is your friend. Go to the Google advanced search page, put in whatever 
you want search for, Procmail, for example, and then go down near the bottom 
of the page and enter:

pdxlinux.org

in the box for restricting the search to a specific domain.

You could also just put this into a Google search box:

Procmail site:pdxlinux.org

and get the same result.

There are 383 entries for Procmail on the site.

You can use google, as long as you don't mind that the last few days'
messages won't be included in the search (unless the googlebot just
came by).  Type something like this into google:

what you want to search for site:lists.pdxlinux.org

and it'll return messages from all the plug lists.  Is there any way
to tell google to narrow it down to just one of the lists?

We should get this on the web site, but I've added a feed to Gmane:
http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.portland

If you've never used Gmane, it's a mail-to-NNTP gateway and web archive. 
NNTP is the protocol used for reading Usenet news, so any news reader
like the one built into Mozilla/Thunderbird or Pan or Knode works with it.
 Gmane also has a couple of really nice web interfaces to the archives,
 RSS feeds and searching.

You might notice that I'm actually reading the list through it :)

null pointer errors...perhaps the old double free problem or perhaps
the uninitialized variable conundrum...I'd apply Old Crustacean or other
available barleywine if it's winter, in the summer a Belgian Triple.

If it were me I'd place the bottle unopened within sight with a promise to 
enjoy when the pointer error was no more.  With such motivation a solution
would be quickly found.  Or at least I'd have a handy bedtime snack for when
I gave up for sleep.

Wow, that's cool.  It offers a few different ways to read the list emails.  I'm
writing this reply with the "blog interface", just to see how that works.

Hey, when I tried to post it told me, "There's much more quoted text in your

I've got an older Wacom digitizer tablet that was made for Macs with an
ADB connector (Apple Desktop Bus; it's the PS/2-like connectors used in
pre-USB Macs for mice, keyboards, etc).  There are products available like
the Griffin iMate (http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/imate/).  The
problem, of course, is whether or not any of these devices have Linux
support... The Linux USB HCL (http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/) turns up
nothing for iMate (except "ulimate" and such) nor for ADB.

Has anyone used one of these?  Do I have any chance in hell of getting one
of these things working?

Frightfully enough, Microsoft has published a doc on doing it:

http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/planning/security/kerbsteps.asp

And on a RH box, you should/could just run 'authconfig' to do that setup. 
Actually, though, the pam.d/system-auth file works better if you tweak it
a bit:  You really want pam_krb5 before pam_unix (and/or pam_ldap) and to
move 'use_first_pass' to the latter modules.

Also, you can use the 'net' command to create the host key in Active
Directory and copy it to the local keytab; otherwise you end up using a
less defined process to get the host's key from a w2k workstation into the
key tab.

There's also fun stuff you can do with winbind to automatically map W2K
SIDs to UID/GIDs and with OpenLDAP (or apparently now MySQL) site-wide.

Markoff, is the same person who badly distorted what Kevin Mitnick did.
Markoff's efforts resulted in more severe penalties for Mitnick than would
otherwise have applied.

I want to copy files from machine foo to machine bar, preserving their
numeric UID/GID (user ID and group ID, for you newbies).  Assume I am
doing this as root (on both ends), and the files have all sorts of
UID/GID numbers, not necessarily matching the same users and groups
for the two machines. 

Can this be done with sftp or scp?

The only way I know to do this now is with the -o option to tar, moving
the files as a tar archive through an ssh pipe.  I am specifically
interested in sftp or scp solutions if possible.

Short of hardware failure, the filesystem is responsible if you're getting
directories that aren't functioning properly or files that seem to be
files but aren't.  Or you've got data files from multiple applications
that are corrupted.  Using the SMART features of your drive should help
you determine if the drive itself is having problems.  I guess there was a
time when a couple of the IDE chipsets could mess things up, but I don't
think any of my systems ever had them.  If you've got write-caching
enabled on your drive (some IDE drives default to having it on) and you
have power source problems then you could also get corruption caused by
hardware.

How would you know which it is?  Intuition I guess.

I believe scp -p preserves permissions.

 From man scp(1):

      -p      Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from 
the original file.

One caveat: if you have differing numeric UIDs GIDs between machines, I 
don't believe scp is smart enough to figure out username equivalences.

Yeah, Markoff is still writing, despite the huge ethical issues with the 
way he handled Kevin's case. The man has a real knack for 
self-promotion. I consider him to be barely a step above people like 
Jayson Blair (who also write for the Times) and Stephen Glass.

Chris,

   It all depends on what you mean by "better deal". An Etch-A-Sketch(TM)
works for PHBs. My understanding (which may be terminally flawed) of Lindows
is that you need to buy a subscription from them for upgrades and you're
pretty well locked in to their setup because of hardware issues.

   What do you want/need to do on the portable box? I have my older Toshiba
Portege for sale; my fiancee is happily running a ThinkPad 600E (Pentium
II/400MHz) from the same -- 1999 -- era). You can almost certainly find a
solid, used machine from a reputable seller that will meet your needs. On
the new end of the spectrum, "better deals" also depend on how you value
various options.

HTH,

Rich

	Well, I'm about this close |_| to getting an old circa 98 Toshiba
laptop from work and I was gonna see if I could shoehorn Mandrake onto it.

	All I am gonna need it for is mobile desktop, (probably KDE,)
something to mess around with if I'm bored, and not at home. It will be
ideal if I am on the road; as I could, at that point, learn things like Perl
while killing time. 
	Outside of that it would mostly be just a comms device..

Perhaps it would be just the thing to introduce Linux to the SO.

Likely you want the -p option to scp or -P for sftp get/put. Common
option for Preserve all permissions. Though this only covers the standard
permission bits, not the extended things like ACLs or ext2's immutable
flags.

Just speculating, but unless Griffin wanted to go out of their way to
make it difficult for themselves and require weird-ass drivers, the
iMate should just work like an ordinary USB HID.  And AFAIK, their
other products play nice with Linux.

Speaking of interesting USB HIDs, FreeGeek got in a pile of boards a
while ago.  They're for *serious* flight simulator fans, and are meant
to act like a bank of six jet engine throttle control levers.  They
look to Linux like a six-axis USB joystick.  I'm trying to see if I
can hack alternate inputs on 'em for sensing.

   I've run Red Hat and Slackware on the portables here so I suppose that
Mandrake will work just fine.

   Er, ... how much RAM does that box have? We ran Knoppix (which uses KDE)
on the ThinkPad last Saturday at the clinic. With 128M RAM it crawled. On a
former workstation here -- 64M RAM -- KDE would not run at all. I've used
only Xfce and that runs on everything I have used, including the box with
64M RAM.

   If you get the Toshiba I suggest you look into a lighter weight
window/desktop manager to run on it. For what you write your needs would be
any old window manager would work. KDE (or Gnome) probably won't.

   Good luck! It'll be much better than the Lindows box from Mall-Wart.

Used is about it.  And that often gets you a unit with a dead battery
and shock-damaged hard drive.  (So try the battery and if possible,
check the HDD before buying.)

With those caveats, a '98 Toshiba should be OK.  Should take SODIMM
RAM and Cardbus network cards.

Jeez, it's gotten so that I feel underdressed if I show up at a
coffeehouse without a laptop.

That is partly due to the running-in-RAM nature with no backing store
available for use.

I don't run KDE, but I once ran X on a 486 with 16 meg of RAM (okay,
it was slow) and some swap.  My laptop has only 192meg and (except for
trying to run a bunch of UML for a demo once) I haven't noticed a RAM
shortage.

I run Gnome with Mandrake 10.1 on a 700 MHz P-III and 128 MB RAM and
it does ok.  It does do a fair amount of swapping but it's plenty
usable.

Indeed, -p preserves permissions, but it does NOT preserve numeric
UID/GID .  The reason I am asking is for a by-hand "move files one
by one" situation, where the rsync command line is too much typing. 

However, if I cannot do it with sftp or scp (and some magic and using
some poorly documented option), I will probably build a Perl script
for moving individual files, built around rsync, with ssh transport.
I can hide the complexity and the typing in the script.  That is,
after all, why we love Linux.

Or tar piped through ssh.  A mighty fine way to sling files around.

I've been looking for documentation on managing firefox's extensions. 
I'd like to install them once per system in order to have them available 
  for any subsequent users of the system.  So far my feeble attempts 
have not resulted in fruitfullness and the firefox website seems lacking 
in documentation in this concern.  Ideas?

I've been using the acroread plugin with mozilla.  When I load a PDF,
CPU utilization goes to 100% and stays there until I close the PDF.
Evidently, a newer version of acroread (5.10 for linux) corrects
this.  Indeed, installing the new version and restarting mozilla seems
to have fixed it.

I believe scp cannot do what you want. Check this bug report:
http://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=427

There is a proposed patch to preserve uid/gid but it's rejected.

I suspect that there may be security ramifications as well with root
blindly creating files owned by another user. Definitely so if
permissions are fully preserved, including the setuid bit, but may be
even without it.

Anyway, the best way to copy everything exactly as-is is to pipe tar
through ssh, this also copies links accurately.

Is tar better in an observable way than rsync in this regard, and 
if so, how?

Did you go check out bugmenot?  That's exactly the problem it solves,
you don't have to log in, it logs in some made up user for you.  Yeah,
it's still obnoxious that you even have to make the extra effort to
get bugmenot, but if you are that adamant about not logging in, there
are plenty of news sites that don't require a login.

No, the issue is not protecting the box from the root. It's protecting
the root from inadvertently compromizing his own system.

tar is also observable. rsync with -e ssh is about the same as tar
over ssh, although if you need to give ssh some options you have to
explicitly call it.

Subject: [PLUG] FC2 won't load some sites
Message-ID: <20041221182713.54099.qmail@web60801.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

For some reason, FC2 2.6.8.1 does not seem to want to load some sites
in browsers.  I have this problem with Firefox, Mozilla, Konqueror,
etc.  One example is Perlmonks.org.  I can *sometimes* get to the site,
but never when I try to log in.  Typically I'll see the site title show
up in the tab and that's about it.

I can get there with Lynx, however.  The only information I've found
about this is at
http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-22833.html

The description of the problem is rather similar to mine, but due to a
problem with my graphics card driver, I can't boot into older kernel
versions and startx (as the person describing their problem did.)

There were suggestions that this was an IPV6 issue, so I tried adding
"IPV6INIT=no" to "/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0".  I also
tried adding the following two lines to /etc/modprobe.conf:

  alias net-pf-10 off
  alias ipv6 off

Those didn't seem to help.  I'm stumped and I don't know if IPV6 is a
red herring or not.

I have this problem in both KDE and Fluxbox.

I also cannot get to easystreet.com or http://cornellsun.com, the site
that the author of the problem listed above mentioned.

Cheers,
Ovid

Depending on how it was compiled, the system-wide directory for Mozilla
and Firefox plug-ins is /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins.  It might be easiest to
create this directory if it doesn't exist and chown it to your user, since
that's how you'll be running Firefox.

Sounds like a problem we had too when upgrading to FC2.  We could actually
get to the sites, but it took like seriously, many minutes.  Check out
this link and see if it pertains:

<http://lwn.net/Articles/92727/>

Something about the new kernel trying to use a large TCP segment/widow
size from default.  The article concludes that Internet routers along the
way are spontaneously rewriting the TCP header, which I totally doubt. 
However, the link above fixed our problem.

Hrm, that may be a fly in the ointment of my theory.  It seemed to be a
kernel issue, and wouldn't Lynx use the same kernel services as *zilla?

Yes! Look at the IBM certified used equipment page (I'm sorry I can't
provide a link, but it's easy to find).  You can usually find ~1ghz
thinkpads in the 500-600 range. (with more memory, tested batteries..
IBM's name on the line, etc..)

Regarding the linspire box:

I second (or third, fourth?...) the memory concerns, but I'd also be
concerned about battery life.. they claim "over 1.5 hours.." In my
experience, anything less than 3-5 hours means you've got to carry a
power adapter everywhere you go, and be prepared to use it.  Keep in
mind that thrashing/swapping will be a significant hit to battery life
also--which brings us back to memory...

I'd also be concerned about weight, (8.0lbs shipping weight) you may
want to carry around an extra 8-lb book for a few days just to see
what it's like.   Depending on your useage patterns, this may not
matter, but it is a concern for many people.

Here's a true story about my thinkpad t20.  Anyone that has one (or a
t21, probably the same) just press on the lid a bit, you know, from
behind the screen, and watch the waves on your LCD.  There is pretty
much no protection there.  After taking mine to school and back for a
few months, I took it out of my bag one day and the LCD was shattered.
 I wasn't using a "laptop" bag, but after paying about $500 to get a
new LCD (actually used from ebay) installed I went and bought the most
expensive laptop bag with the most padding and protection I could
find.  I'm a little annoyed about that whole experience and wouldn't
wish it on anyone else.  I've also never found another laptop that has
a lid that  weak.

Does this mean the user needs the ability to write in

Seems a bit drastic for a multi-user system.

Many people on this list use Debian, so maybe I should
try it. There are 7 CD's for each architecture, so I
suppose I should get all seven. With a fast
connection, that isn't too much of a problem.

"Woody" is said to include KDE 2.2. That must be a
joke. If they're serious, I suppose there's some way
to upgrade easily to 3.x?

You shouldn't need any CD's.

Look for the stable floppies, or just burn the first CD....

I usually just use 6 floppies and an internet connection.

after you get an initial OS installed change your /etc/apt/sources.list
from
stable to testing.

that should get you KDE 3.3.

Or, use Knoppix to install debian.

If you have a fast connection, don't bother downloading a boatload of
ISOs. Just download one of the net-install ISOs and install everything
else via one of the package repositories. That's one of Debian's finer
points. There really is no need to think in terms discrete "releases"
when you're only an "apt-get upgrade" away from the latest packages.

Last I looked "Sid" offered KDE 3.3. Don't bother with Woody (AKA
"stable") unless you're really paranoid about security and stability
(*really* paranoid). Stick to Sid (AKA "unstable", and anything but)
if it's a normal user machine (workstation, laptop, etc.).

NB: In my experience, the Debian maintainers use "stable" and
"unstable" in a different way than one would normally expect in the
context of personal computers. They don't mean that Sid is unstable in
the sense that your computer will be crashing a lot. Rather, it means
that the package tree is in flux, and that individual packages can and
do change quite often (meaning you may want to upgrade every week or
so).

I vote for what everyone else said. I run Sid (unstable) on a lot of machines 
and it works just fine. The trouble spots are with new releases, especially 
big complex packages like KDE and Gnome. Sometimes it takes a couple of weeks  
to work out all the dependencies. The system is not unstable; the "unstable" 
bit is working out the dependency kinks.

Debian probably has the smoothest upgrade path of any Linux. Install once for 
life.

Getting used to apt-get can take a bit of work, this might help:

No, please RTFM.  http://cdimage.debian.org/  You only need the first CD 
if you have a high speed connection.  Downloading all the CDs to 
install on a system that has access to a cheap, fast connection is a 
waste of time and bandwidth.

   Yesterday, Poland killed the almost-certain decision of the EU to allow
software patents. Today, the EU's First Court denied Microsoft's request to
stay the penalties imposed on them while they appeal. See:

<http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=4MPP3MZAHUA2YCRBAEZSFFA?type=businessNews&storyID=7159636>

   Also yesterday, here in the US, SCO had its 4Q conference call with
investors and reported that they will drop the last fragment of their law
suit against Daimler-Chrysler for "lack of timliness in responding". The
judge tossed the remainder of that case a while ago.

Looks a lot like a happy holiday season, no?

It will be intersting what the US government's statement will be, if any, 
regarding the EU's decision given that Microsoft wasn't even given a tiny 
baby slap on the wrist here in the U.S.

Message-ID: <200412221032.05315.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

I'm finally getting around to moving /home over to the new partition I created 
last week (or was it the week before?). I read info coreutils cp, but got it 
wrong, so I'm looking for the right way to move the files and preserve all 
the attributes.

I have the new partition mounted on /home2. As root, I tried copying thus:

cp -r /home /home2

This resulted in a copy of home in /home2. In other words, /home2 had in it, 
home. Also, all the files ended up with root as the owner.

Re-reading info coreutils cp, I discovered that I should have use the -p 
option to preserve the attributes. However it's still a little fuzzy, so 
here's today's question: is this the form of the cp command I should have 
used?

cp -r -p all /home/rsteff /home2

(The only directory in /home is rsteff.)

Or, is there another command I should be using?

Dick,

   What I've done is:

 	cp -Ra /home/rsteff/* /home2

Lowercase 'r' is usually a synonym for uppercase 'R'. The 'a' is for
archive:

        -a, --archive
               Preserve as much as possible of the  structure  and
               attributes  of  the original files in the copy (but
               do not preserve directory  structure).   Equivalent
               to -dpPR.

HTH,

Rich

Hi Richard,

Sounds like you've seen this, but here's a man page:

http://www.zevils.com/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+cp

For the kind of thing you're doing, I'd usually use the -a option, which 
is the same as -dpR.

Try:

   cp -a /home/rsteff /home2

Another option would be to use tar if you're more comfortable with that. 
In /home do:

   tar cvf /home2/rsteff.tar rsteff

That will create a tarball in the /home2 directory that has the rsteff 
directory in it.

   cd /home2
   tar xvf rsteff.tar

You might do "tar tvf rsteff.tar" first, to make sure that what you're 
extracting looks right and is in the right place.


Rich

p.s. I'm very tired right now, so be careful using my suggestions ;)

Hey Rich, the -a option includes the -R funtionality already, you can 
use just -a instead of -Ra.

cp -a /home /home2 
is the closest you  get with cp, but it does not always get links right.
The best way is with tar:
cd /home
tar cf - . | (cd ../home2; tar xvf - )

Perhaps a bit cleaner would be

   tar -c -C /home . | tar -x -C /home2

Note: this recipe relies on some switches and defaults unique to GNU 
tar. More portable would be

   cd /home
   tar cf - . | (cd /home2 && tar xf -)

[...]

Richard> Or, is there another command I should be using?

I'd use either:

  rsync -v -a -H /home/ /home2/

or 

  tar -C /home -c . | tar -C /home2 -xpv

A few things to note:

  a) with this rsync command any files that were in /home2 before the
  command but that don't exist in /home will remain.  If you want an
  exact up-to-date copy of /home in /home2, you probably want to use
  the --delete option.

  b) the trailing slashes are significant in rsync.  I've forgotten
  exactly what the significance is, but the above example should
  work.  Read the man page for details.

  c) with the tar-to-tar, it is important *not* to include the verbose
  option on the first tar.  You are depending on standard input/output
  to move your data.  It is not likely to be pretty if you include the
  verbose information in that stream.

  d) there are many variations on the tar-to-tar technique.  If you
  have gnu tar at both ends, then this variant will work.

  e) both methods can work over a network through an ssh tunnel by
  appropriate modification, e.g.:

    rsync -e ssh -v -a -H /home/ hostname:/home2/

  or

    tar -C /home -c . | ssh hostname 'tar -C /home2 -xpv'

The Hard Disk Upgrade mini-HOWTO offers several possible commands.  I 
hope this helps.

Rich,

   I realized that after I sent the message. I don't copy whole directories
all that often. But, I did do so extensively when moving from RH 7.3 to
Slackware 10.0.

Thanks,

   It is no wonder that people panic when defenestrating. Instead of the
security of having only the one Microsoft way to do something, they're faced
with having to make difficult choices; e.g., cp, tar, rsync and more.

Life's so difficult,

And as per usual, there's a bunch of ways to do it.

I usually use this command:

root@/home $ find . | cpio -pdm /home2

When it's done, cpio had duplicated the contents of /home in /home2.

Nah, verbose option does not hurt anything. You can specify it on one
or both tar's, but if you do both the output is kind of messy, you get
every line twice.

I might be the odd one out in suggesting it, but this sounds like the
size problem where I prefer dump. This is because dump really *can*
preserve everything. Particularly with home directories since folks can
do interesting things...

Yes, those are four 1TB files there with interesting named. Depending on
the flavor of tar, it could take hours to dump this, and it might well
fail to fit onto the target FS. tar might also fail to notice that those
four are hard links to each other.

So for dump/restore:
dump -0f - | ( cd <FS> ; restore -xf - )

And this *will* preserve interesting files like the above.

Has anyone played with unison?  I imagine it'd be pretty handy for

Panic?  I haven't seen any body panic.  Though become a little 
frustrated until they start to get used to the unixy way of doing 
things.

That being said, just try accomplishing moving Windows' equivalent 
of /home at all...

Like dump, that one hadn't even occurred to me.

This is exactly what I like about *nixes. Having more than one way to 
get the job done is a strength, from my perspective. You don't need to 
learn how to do the same task ten different ways, if you find one that 
works you can stick with it. But if you do run into a method you like 
better, then you can go that route instead.

That sounds really nice, and I want it.  Recently when upgrading
(actually re-installing a newer version of) Mandrake or Fedora I've
noticed some big changes such as the 2.6 kernel, udev, SElinux, etc. 
Does a Debian apt-get upgrade handle those sorts of changes well? 
Does it preserve tweaks to stuff in /etc/whatever well?  I have a
Mandrake 10 machine at home that is set-up just perfectly, and I've
been afraid to upgrade it because I know I'll have to redo all the
little tweaks that I've made.  It'd be really cool to never have to
fear that again.  Probably worth a distro switch.

Unison is a handy tool; be aware that you need ocaml for it to work. 
Plus, if you're using it for inter-host copying, you need to have 
identical versions on both end of the connection.

For the most part, yes.  Of course, there's still the occasional issue 
that comes up, but that's the nature of having user-tested software.

> Does it preserve tweaks to stuff in /etc/whatever well?

Yes, debconf will even preserve hand-made changes.

Hmm (some digging around in the tar source), ah yeah.  In the function
open_archive() of buffer.c, stdlis (the verbose destination) gets
redirected to stderr if the archive is being written to stdout.

That behavior makes sense.  I was being overly cautious.  Okay,
scratch (c), and thanks for the correction.

GNU tar handles hardlinks and (with -S) sparse files.

Curious, will dump-restore work if you source and destination
filesystems are different?

I'll add my voice to the dump|restore option.  IIRC, it'll handle 
"sparse" files
better than tar.  Sparse files have large blocks of 0's which aren't really
allocated as disk blocks. (I don't know how the filesystem tracks such 
stuff,
or if such is even supported in ext2/ext3.)

I remember core files on some Sun systems claiming to occupy 100's of MB
of disk, but after deletion, df would only show 10's of MB freed.  No biggie
until you try copying some users home dirs using tar, and they suddenly
blow up 10x in size!  tar-based backup programs would have problems with
this, too.

Yes -- they are really meant to work on complete filesystems at a time,
not just directories/folders.  Safest results are if the source 
filesystem is
unmounted or mounted read-only.

If you've ever had to restore items from a tape with only a vague idea of
the filename, the interactive restore program ("restore -i") is much easier
than reading the whole tape with "tar t" to get the table of contents.

Yes, ext2/3 do sparse files.

GNU tar with -S creates sparse-honoring archives.  For example, try:

  $ dd if=/dev/zero of=i-am-sparse count=1 seek=1023
  $ ls -ls i-am-sparse
  $ ln i-am-sparse i-am-spars2
  $ ln i-am-sparse i-am-spars3
  $ ln i-am-sparse i-am-spars4
  $ tar -cSf /tmp/sparse.tar i-am-spars[e234]
  $ pushd /tmp
  $ tar xvf sparse.tar
  $ ls -ls i-am-spars[e234]

Strict policy is one of the things I like about Debian. I find it
tremenously irritating when an package installer doesn't respect the
changes I've made to by own system. When a Debian package update
contains a new version of a config file, and the installer notices
you've made changes to the current config, it'll give you the option
of installing the new version or keeping your old one. In either case,
the version you don't use will be saved with an appropriately obvious
file name extension so that you can go in and merge the differences by
hand.

  I hear ya!  I installed the MG-SOFT MIB browser on my Linux test machine a
few months ago.  Along with the MIB browser, it installed it's own SNMP trap
daemon over the top of the running NET-SNMP trap daemon.  It overwrote the
config files and startup scripts without so much as a "Yes/No" question.

  It was a demo copy of their software.  The sales guy didn't seem to think
it was a problem.  I decided *not* to purchase their products because of the
poor installer behavior.

I looked into this once and there were all kinds of solutions, some
that even automatically emailed the originating machines owners and
told them they were infected.  I never actually tried any of them out,
but google around for the message you are getting in the log and you
can find out which worm it is, then you can google for scripts that
handle it.

OK, that's not much help, but yes, there are scripts that deal with
that stuff...

Yes. dump is filesystem specific, restore is not. If the destination
filesystem doesn't support features that the source filesystem does
though, you'll lose those features but otherwise everything works.

Things like permissions, hard links and sparse files have a well defined
API through the kernel and will always be preserved. Extended ACLs and
flags (such as ext2's nodump, immutable, append-only, etc) are only
guarenteed on the same type of filesystem. Large files may also be
truncated if the target doesn't support files that large.

It will still need to read a terabyte of zeros though.

More of an educational level.
I'm finally comfortable enough with several versions of Linux so that 
the change is within the pain threshold of the required learning curve.

I will always miss Agent as my news/email client.

I am still unhappy with several ways the distros do things, but that is 
the learning curve pain threshold one makes when switching.

I think the best reason is that the most recent distros have conquered 
my dread of setting up PPP for dial up. In my last three installs, it 
has worked flawlessly from the start. I'm still working on the " How to 
do dialup without logging in as root" thing. But, for now, I'm accepting 
that one little flaw.

Beyond that? Well I could sit and bitch for hours, but that would be the 
same for Windows. Lots of things I'd like to see, but since I'm a user 
and not a developer, I can only make my wishes known as just that, wishes.


I still have tons of things to learn in order to make me feel like I 
actually know enough to be secure  in my systems, but that comes with 
time. So, with a shread of fear and trepidation, next week will see the 
demise of my last Windows OS box.


I'd hold a wake, but I can't afford the whisky.


Later,

Harry

Had the same annoyance.  I installed xpdf and connected that with
Mozilla instead of acroread.  Much better!  Note, you may have to remove
the acroread plugin manually in order to invoke xpdf from Mozilla.

With all us experts on file copy techniques, you might feel silly for
trying to use a tool so primitive as cp.  But after all, it's probably
all you need.

I wanted to point out that you probably had an existing /home2 directory
when you ran the cp command above:  that would explain why /home ended
up within /home2.  When copying one directory path to another, using cp,
what happens depends on whether the destination directory already
exists.  If it does NOT exist, then cp will create it as a direct copy
of the source directory.

Thus, if you remove /home2 completely and then execute

cp -pR /home /home2

you should get what you bargained for.  Works for a one-off, but if
you're doing a backup and plan to repeat it, you should use a more
suitable tool.

In Debian, the easiest way to do it in the long term from what I've 
found requires an external modem with a power switch.  Use pppconfig to 
set up your connection and tell it to persist and to automatically 
reconnect if it disconnects.  mv /etc/ppp/no_ppp_on_boot 
to /etc/ppp/ppp_on_boot.  PPP is now set up to try to reconnect at all 
costs.  Use the switch on the modem to turn on or off the connection.  
It may take a few seconds to dialup again when you turn on the modem.

Simple, elegant and it works.  What more could you ask for?

ClamAV is pretty nice.  It does miss, however, a number of trojans.  (I 
have a source for backdoors and other nasty viruses (called Usenet) that I 
test with a couple of virus scanners.  Anything that ClamAV misses gets 
submitted to their online posting area.)

One other problem with ClamAV is that it will mistake multipart archives 
as being "oversized" on occasion.  (Enough of a false positive ratio that 
I have to disable that set of tests.)

No.  pon requires root, IIRC.  Pushing the power switch on the modem is

As some of us head out for that last minute shopping I'll ask the question
I've been meaning to all week.

I'm comtemplating a new color printer.  Of couse I want it to do
everything, cost little, and possible read my mind (so it knows what I
want not what I configured :-)

But more realistically I'd like some thing that works well with CUPS (and 
I'm not beyond buying a driver from ESP) will do photo quality, and has a 
parallel interface.  The last would seem to be the toughest part but I 
have a print-server that uses parallel.

So what are PLUGers using and what do they like and dislike about their 
printer?

So if you're lucky like me and can avoid computers and the internet for
the next few days I hope to hear from you next week.

Season's Greetings!

While I haven't purchased one myself yet... I'd strongly suggest looking
at some of the cheap color laser printers out there.  I would imagine
the cheapest laser is probably still far more reliable (and less
expensive to maintain) than the most expensive ink-jet printers.

Not that I've used dialup in a long while, but I think you just have
to add the user to the dialout group.  Otherwise, probably time to
file a bug report.

HP & Epson work well with linux in general. I would start at their 
respective websites, and look for one with a parallel interface. There 
are USB to parallel converters available too.

Subject: [PLUG] is my watch running windows?  
Message-ID: <86fz1w15gi.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I had to reboot my watch the other day.  I have one of the Timex
digital "Triathlon" watches.  Tuesday morning I woke up and found that
the display was blank.  I've had watch batteries die before, but this
didn't fit that pattern.  With a dying battery usually the display
will start to sag, will fade after using the backlighting, etc. for
days, weeks or months before finally dying for good.  This one just up
and went blank.  Oh well, throwaway society and all, I figure I'd have
to go get another battery, or maybe a new watch.

Back around 1980 I had a Texas Instruments LCD watch that I loved and
that worked forever.  All the gold-toned plating wore off, it looked
like hell, but kept excellent time until I finally lost it on a hike
in the mid-1990s.  See:

  <http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=31387&item=4953358856&rd=1&ssPageName=WDVW>

Sigh ....

Sorry, where was I... oh yeah.

So I woke up on Tuesday and the display was blank.  I pushed the
buttons a few times and got no observable response, so I set it down
on my desk and went about my day.  An hour or so later I happened to
look at it again and all of the elements of the LCD are "on" at once.
I try pushing buttons again.  This time the display seems to dim
slightly to the button presses but the diplay otherwise doesn't
change.  All the display bits are pegged on.  Okay, the battery isn't
dead afterall.  Maybe the FBI surveillance has just had a glitch.  So
I set it down again and go downstairs.  A little while later, I walk
by the door to the stairs and I hear a high pitched whine.  Oh Christ,
I think.  One of the hard disks is failing.  So I run up stairs, and
start stooping around trying to locate the source of the sound.
Because of the geometry of the room and the hard plaster walls, I have
some considerable difficulty locating the sound.  I think it is coming
from one of my desktop boxes, but when I stoop down next to it, the
noise goes away.  It seems to be coming from the other side of the
room, so I go over there.  No it is quieter there.  I'm not sure now
whether it is a bearing noise.  Maybe it's a UPS alarm.  I look there.
Nope.  It takes me two minutes to discover that it is my watch.  The
beeper is pegged on full blast.  I push a button and the beep stops.
Now another display appears, immutable:

   Mo  9  9
    3 23 11

Buttons don't alter the display.  I set it down again, almost afraid
to leave it alone again.  I'll have to deal with this later, when I
can dig out my little screw drivers (I think they are in the
basement).  The watch has evidently gotten into some wacky wedged
condition, which a power cycle ought to fix.  Who knows, a stray
cosmic ray, maybe Kenneth had the wrong frequency, whatever.  I drop
off the boys with the grandparents and come home, finding the
screwdrivers (yes, they were in the basement) and I gently remove the
four tiny screws on the back.  When I've got the plate free from of
the plastic overlapping tabs of the watch band, I see the back of a
battery occupying most of the interior of the watch and before I even
start to look to see how to free the battery, my eye catches a small
bit of wording, something to the effect: "to reset, push here".  There
is a tiny tab of metal above a metal pad, a kind of switch.  I manage
to get the screwdriver centered on the tab, push it flush against the
pad, and bingo.  It is suddenly a few seconds after midnight.  I reset
the time on the watch from the xdaliclock (try it, it's cool) running
on my ntp-maintained desktop clock, and I am resynchronized with my
life again.  Whew!

I've never had that happen before.  Anyone else?

Merry Christmas.

Thanks for all the replies. I finally used:

tar -c -C /home . | tar -x -C /home2

This seems to have worked. The copy I made before must have missed something 
because when I opened K-Mail and clicked on a message in the list, the 
subject changed from what is should be to something indicating that there was 
no subject, and no message appeared in the lower pane, either. Fortunately, I 
did not delete the original, so I could go back and reconstruct the old 
setup.

I'm assuming that's where the problem was. Here's what I did.

Exited X.
Switched to a console screen.
Logged in and su'd to root and cd'd to /.
Cleaned out the contents of /home2 with rm -r.
Ran { tar -c -C /home . | tar -x -C /home2 } followed by the following:

umount home2
mv home home1
mv home2 home
mount /dev/hda8 home

Then I switched back to the X login screen, and logged back in. I did change 
fstab to reflect the change from mounting /dev/hda8 on /home2 to /home.

All seems to be working, so far. I'll give it a day or so, and then I'll feel 
comfortable deleting the old home directory and moving my collection of 
photographs over so I can work on them with the GIMP.

I thought about trying rsync, but discovered that it is not installed. I made 
that discovery after I was logged in on the console screen. I think that's 
the only thing I have to grouse about regarding the SuSE personal 
distribution: several tools that are commonly installed with other 
distributions do not come standard with this one. I can easily add them with 
YaST, but it is slightly frustrating to want to use something that "always 
used to be there" and find it missing. Make is another example. I don't use 
it a lot, but every once in a while I like to try out something that comes as 
source files, so I'll have to add make, and I'll have to check to see what 
other development tools aren't there, like a compiler. Not a big deal; just a 
minor annoyance.

Thanks again for all the support this group provides.

Merry Christmas to all.

I don't think you'll get photo-quality prints with a cheap color laser
printer.  At least, not as good as you can get with even a cheap
inkjet these days.

You can get full functionality from HP inkjets under Linux (probably
others too, I just happen to work in Vancouver for a large technical
company that has me a little biased towards a certain brand).  You are
correct that a parallel port printer going to be hard to find these
days.

You know that the real cost comes from the consumables, right? So avoid models 
with the 3-in-1 color cartridges. Get the kind with separate ink tanks for 
each color. You'll pay more for the printer, but you'll make it back quickly 
in ink costs. Epson is the best one for finding models that use a separate 
cartridge for each. 

Visit http://linuxprinting.org/ to get information on Linux support. Of course 
all printer manufacturers are suckhead morons when it comes to Linux support; 
linuxprinting.org is a great resource.

On a side note, beware of laser printers that ship with half-full toner 
cartridges. HP is notorious for this. When you buy replacement laser toner, 
get the Staples brand. They cost less and contain more toner, and you can 
choose either new or refurbished. They work great, you don't have to worry 
about quality.

Eee parallel is difficult. Hardly anyone supports parallel anymore.

The ESP drivers are really good, and you get better printer management tools.

I deal with the same thing. I think it is the difference between the 
Personal Edition vs the Professional Edition. One of the reasons I plan 
to try debian. (When I get the time and the nerve, at the same time.)

   I will highly recommend replacement toner and inkjet cartridges from
Cartridge World in SE Portland. They use quality parts, completely fill the
toner cartridge and often will deliver in the local area. All for a _very_
reasonable cost.

   My former toner cartricge rebuilder went out of business. I bought two
cartridges from someone else. Both were faulty (schmutz along the edges of
the paper; a grey band the width of the text. When I took out the "new"
refill and used the one from Cartridge World the problems disappeared. And,
it's a locally-owned franchise so we get very good service.

I had problems with the LCD of my T20, but did not shatter--it started
making splotchy colors and lots of static-y lines.  I disassembled it and
reseated the connection it its been perfect since.  Just another data
point; not that it's the same as what you had.

This isn't exactly what you're looking for, but you can filter this kind
of stuff in Apache itself, which might be easier:

SetEnvIf Request_URI "default\.ida" filtered-log
SetEnvIf Request_URI "root\.exe" filtered-log
SetEnvIf Request_URI "server-status" filtered-log
SetEnvIf Request_URI "cmd\.exe" filtered-log
SetEnvIf Remote_Addr 127.0.0.1 filtered-log

...

CustomLog /var/log/httpd/virtual_log vcommon env=!filtered-log

('vcommon' is a log format I've defined; the 'env=!filtered-log' is the
important part.)

I really like the T-2* machines and bot 4 for my office (well, my mom, 
my home armchair and two for the office) at under $500 with good 
features and 20-30gb hd's.  The PIII's at 800-900 mhz are plenty 
adequate for everything I want to do and the machines are a great 
compromise between light, portable, powerful and tuff enuf.

I've had the same basic experience that Wil described with the screen on 
one of my T-21's.  Thru operator error (fell asleep and let it fall off 
my lap) I got a single pixel wide white static line across the screen.

Does anyone know where I can find a "How-To" on the proper procedure to 
disassemble it and
reseated the LCD connection?

Thanks and Merry Christmas.

Doesn't seem like a big deal to me; chown it to yourself or create a group
and do all the stuff you'd need to give the group access.

Not the exact same mode of crashing, but a similar one. Happens with the
advanced watches. Get one that simply tells the time and maybe stopwatch
functions and it won't have this sort of failure mode. All the ones with
advanced features will wig out in some way like this.

Most likely not running a Microsoft product though. Not enough memory or
CPU, yet.

I think I still have a copy of the repair manual pdf.  Try searching
for it on google, and I'll see if I can dig up the file for you.

Or IBM's web site.  IBM has fairly extensive documentation, once you find
it.  I didn't, of course, until after I'd reassembled it.

A question about politeness and wget.

I have been spending quite a bit of time away from the net, tending to
my mother in the hospital and elsewhere.  I am looking at twiki as a
possible replacement for kwiki, and did a "wget -rk" of the twiki.org
site so I could peruse it offline.  Now, wget -r respects robots.txt,
so it isn't downloading anything the site does not want a site scraper
to see.

The wget went slow - it was still going 2 days and 41MB later (I have
300KBps cable, so this is surprising).  But the big annoyance was that
it stopped, before wget got to the -k part (it should be redesigned to
do this as it goes along, but that is a different gripe).  When I 
manually web to the site, I get:

> You are black listed at the TWiki web site due to excessive access or
> suspicious activities. Please contact site administrator
> peter.thoeny at attglobalSTOPSPAM.net if you got on the list by mistake.
> Black listed IP addresses will be submitted to major blacklist databases.

So, the question;  is there some wget etiquette that I don't know about?

Golly, Keith, I think something funny must have happened.  Your download
tree is only 41MB?  My immediate suspicion was that there was some odd
circular symlinking on the twiki site that caused you to spiral down some
directory and make a mess of things.

As you point out, wget's respect for robots.txt makes it ideal for site
scraping and grabbing one copy of each file on a site is hardly suspicous
or excessive access.

I think you need to contact Peter and explain the situation.  From what
you say, you did nothing offensive whatsoever.

Thanks Bryan & Wil.

I found the T-2* series manual at:  
ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/pc/pccbbs/mobiles_pdf/62p9631.pdf

Incredibly complete instructions.  Too bad IBM's selling off their PC 
division.  I'll bet the service and support are never the same.

Happy holidays all,

My web site doesn't get enough traffic to make robots a true nuisance, 
but I do occasionally see someone run through the entire site in the 
span of a couple minutes -- which strikes me as annoying.

Have you tried the --wait option to specify a timeout between 
retrievals? E.g.,

   wget --mirror --wait=2m http://blah.foo.com/

The retrieval process is slower, but much kinder to the remote server.

I am finally going to try to take that final leap from being windows
dependent and move my backend to linux.  I am looking to replace my MS
domain controller/mail server with a linux box.  What I am curious about
is how to implement windows (for my wife's PC, and i still have some
apps I have to use that only work on windows) into my new linux network.
I have used samba in the past but in the opposite direction, using it to
access windows shares.  How difficult is it to have samba be the "domain
controller" for my new network?  Can you still have file level security
on the MS machines?  My understanding of samba is it works in the old
"workgroup" style of MS networking - which in windows land means no file
level security.  

Thanks in advance

Windows NTFS and Linux filesystems operate with different sets of file 
permissions, which Samba does not try to translate. And FAT filesystems have 
no access controls at all. To restrict access to files set up Samba shares, 
then configure access controls on the shares. 

One option is to set up shared directories on each PC. Then each shared 
directory has its own Samba share and access controls. Another way is to use 
Samba as a central file server, and put all shared files on it. Or mix n 
match.

It's dead easy to use Samba as a NT4-style domain controller. These are the 
steps:

1. Configure Samba to act as a PDC
2. Create a Samba root user account on the Samba box 
3. Configure your windows PCs as domain clients
4. Set up Windows machine accounts on the Samba box. This is the bit everyone 
leaves out- each windows PC needs its own Samba account, plus you must log in 
immediately to establish the trust relationship between Samba and the Windows 
PC. You'll need the Samba root user for this initial login
5. Create human user accounts in Linux on the Samba box, and again in Samba
6. Create file and printer shares
7. Set up access controls on shares

Shares can allow/deny access on a per-user basis, or groups. The users must 
have Samba accounts. The groups are ordinary NIS or /etc/groups. Again, 
because of the differences in the many Windows and the differences between 
Windows and Linux, these extra steps are required.

Windows NT/2000/XP are fairly sane as far as Samba logins go. They send both a 
login and password, so you can log into Samba as a different user than the 
Windows user. Windows 95/98/ME default to the Windows user, and lets you send 
only a password. And of course windows XP home can't connect to any kind of 
domain, not winderz, not Samba.

The Samba docs on Samba.org are good. In fact I think they are excessively 
detailed. And if you had my book you would have all this nailed down in an 
hour. :)

Thanks for the advice.  I just discovered the samba newsgroup (yeah I am
a little behind in some aspects :-) ).  Luckily from your tips and what
I read, this looks like it should be pretty easy for me.  Fortunately
this server is getting installed on different hardware than my current
server so I should have minimal downtime, and it will also be hosting
almost all my shared files, now i just gotta find the time to do it.

David,

   I don't know that I can offer the exact answer you want, but I can explain
what I've been doing here for the past several years. I run only linux, but
I have two legacy apps (one mapping the other gps) that run only on
Microsoft. In my case I use VMware to host a virtual win98 machine; in your
case it's a separate host.

   Regardless, using samba I exchange files between the two OSes, in both
directions. Linux is the domain controller; the virtual win98 is a network
host (with its own IP address on the local network).

   What sort of file-level security do you need? On the linux side you have
all the access controls associated with file permissions on the Windows side
you have ... Microsoft. Nothing changes from before.

   Linux is inherently a networked OS. Assign your Windows box(es) IP
addresses in /etc/hosts and they are part of the network. I'll suggest
postfix for your mail server. Easy to set up, secure, works.

HTH,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] Network is unreachable
Message-ID: <41CD99DC.6000008@comcast.net>

I have two machines sharing a keyboard, monitor, and mouse with a 
Linksys KVM switch. Last night, I was composing an e-mail on my Linux 
machine when the screen froze and there was no response to the keyboard 
or mouse. After a few minutes the monitor went into a weird cycle. It 
would go blank for a couple of seconds, blink once, and then return to 
normal for about 1 second. This cycle repeated, continuously.

Since hitting the scroll lock key twice is how the KVM switch knows when 
to switch, I was unable to get to this machine. And, since the keyboard 
is how I would initiate a controlled shutdown, I was left with the 
option of hitting the reset button on the box.

Reset had no effect. I even tried resetting this machine, too, but that 
didn't help. It occurred to me that the problem might be the KVM switch, 
and I thought about how to power cycle it, but since it draws power from 
one of the machines (I don't remember for sure through which cable) I 
couldn't see a way to shut it down without removing one of the cables 
that aren't supposed to be disconnected while powered (see recent 
discussion regarding PS2 mice and keyboards). So, I powered down the 
battery backup that feeds both machines.

Once power was restored, the machines came back up. But, the linux 
machine won't talk to the network. When I try to ping another machine in 
the house I get the message, "Network is unreachable".

When I run ifconfig, I only see information about lo; nothing about eth0.

When I run ifconfig eth0, I see its MAC address and a few lines of 
information. I assume that tells me that the ethernet card is present 
and will talk to the OS.

So, where do I go from here?

Thanks for any advice, and Merry Christmas to all.

   Two steps to the left, down one.

   I've seen this before. The network did not come up fully on one or both
machines.

   On the one showing only lo, try
ifconfig eth0 (down/stop) #depends on your distribution
   then
ifconfig eth0 (up/start) #ditto

   Now, when you do 'ifconfig -a' you should see a line like this:

eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:50:22:E1:1D:CF
           inet addr:192.168.55.1  Bcast:192.168.55.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
           UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
                        ^^^^^^^

   The "RUNNING" is what you want to see.

   Then restart the network on both machines:

   /etc/rc.d/sysconfig/network restart (IIRC from Red Hat days with
SysV-style init scrips) or
   /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 restart (for those distributions with BSD-style init
scripts).

   Then try pinging one machine from the other (both by name and IP address).

   If that doesn't do the trick, let us know what 'ifconfig -a' shows on both
machines.

HTH,

Rich

Your kernel recognizes your network card, but your system's scripts
haven't brought it up.

On debian, this is what I would do:

# ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0

On gentoo:

# /etc/init.d/net.eth0 restart

Rich suggested some other incantations for other distros.

Vram,

   Are you seeking a specific device?

   The command, 'lsmod', reveals what modules the kernel loaded.

   If your pcmcia device is a network card check 'ifconfig -a' to see what
interfaces are available.

   In the generic situation use the 'apropos' command (e.g., 'apropos
pcmcia') to find what else is available on your system.

HTH,

Rich

Actually it was in KPPP.

Google produced an answer.

it has to do with removing the link, changing the kppp in /usr/sbin to 
include u+s, then creating a new link in /usr/bin/kppp.

after a heart stopping moment getting the modem to speak to me, it worked.

As of this Day, I am windowless for 24 hours.

presently running Suse 9.0, Fedora Core 3 and Redhat 7.3(stupid file 
server won't "see" anything newer)

Have a modem issue to work out on the Suse box but printers working 
perfectly and Suse "sees" both Zip drives and my USB flash drive.
Even did a little SSH file transfer this AM between machines on the 
Network here.

I am greatly in the debt to you, Richard, to the Plug list in General 
and to Mike Neal and Ed Sawicki(teachers extraordinaire) for getting me 
this far. May I never tire of telling people how really great all of you 
are.
Nor will I soon forget a particular teacher,who constantly said two, no 
three things to me:

Google is your friend
Did you read the MAN files?
Well, you never really get to know an OS until you've had to install it 
a dozen or so times.

ever so grateful to be in your debt,

Harry

"ifconfig down" and "ifconfig up" work.

Before cycling through ifconfig down/up, I ran:

ifconfig eth0
eth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:50:04:62:c0:44
      BROADCAST MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1
      RX Packets:9 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
      TX Packets:3 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
      collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
      RXbytes:1070 (1.0 Kb) TXbytes:1770 (1.7 Kb)
      Interrupt:11 Base Address 0x1080

After cycling ifconfig and restarting the network from the command line, 
I ran:

ifconfig eth0
eth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:50:04:62:c0:44
      inet6 addr: fe80::250:4ff:fe62:c044/64 Scope:Link
      BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1
      RX Packets:11 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
      TX Packets:8 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
      collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
      RXbytes:1572 (1.5 Kb) TXbytes:2160 (2.1 Kb)
      Interrupt:11 Base Address 0x1080

While that looked like it did something, I still couldn't reach the 
network. I watched the network restart process and saw that DHCP was 
timing out before getting an IP address.

I hadn't thought to try YaST (Yet another System Tool) and fiddled with 
it for a while. I've never done anything with the network settings in 
YaST, and I don't recall what the installation program asked for. Taking 
a wild guess, I added the address of my router, 192.168.0.1, as the 
default gateway. When I exited YaST, I could ping the router. K-mail 
didn't come up right away. I looked at the lock file and found a pid of 
1, which didn't sound right (right now it has a pid of 8xxx). The last 
time I had a problem with the lock file, I deleted it, and k-mail 
created a new one the next time I started it. So, I deleted it, 
restarted k-mail, and it works.

So, while I'm back on the air, I'm not really sure if adding the default 
gateway had anything to do with it, or if the network restart was 
somehow different coming from YaST.

Anyway, thanks, Rich and Evan, for your pointers. I'll now return to 
communicating with the PLUG list from my other machine.

   Yup, it was the lack of a default gateway. I forgot to add that check to
my original message.

Now you can have a happy holiday, eh?

Why I say, "sort of," is that as far as I know, yesterday was the first time a 
default gateway was ever entered for the machine. Why it worked up until the 
other day, I can't explain.

Continue to, yes. Thanks. I didn't let a little thing like being out of 
communication from just one machine cause me any grief. :-)

AFAIK, DHCP normally provides the default gateway. So up until now, DHCP
was doing its job.

Just out of curiosity, what does 'route -n' output?

Naturally, when something like this comes up, I'm usually short on time. Now 
that I have some spare time, I've looked up how the DHCP client works and see 
that it should have been able to get what it needed by broadcasting 
DHCPDISCOVER, which I am assuming it normally does. I'm also assuming that my 
router, which runs a DHCP server should have responded to that request, so 
I'm not sure why I needed to manually configure the default gateway. Maybe I 
didn't. Maybe something was temporarily misconfigured, and my fiddling with 
YaST reconfigured things.

I thought 169.254.cc.dd  was something Microsoft assigned to nic cards
as the default static IP???

Not necessarily.

http://wiki.ethereal.com/APIPA

Specifically:

In many cases the presence of a "link local" address indicates a loss of
network connectivity, or that a DHCP server is down.

and

APIPA is part of [WWW]Zeroconf. See the [WWW]Dynamic Configuration of IPv4
Link-Local Addresses Internet-Draft for more information.

zeroconf is part of serveral distributions at this time.

   I'd read 'man route' then do 'route del 169.254.0.0'. Even with John

Dick,

   For a small network (and I assume you have no more than 4-5 hosts on it),
static IP addresses actually give you more control. That's what I've been
running here for a number of years. And, when I'm traveling and need an IP
address on the hotel ethernet or someone's WiFi network I run 'dhcpcd' (as
root) and get a working IP address for as long as I'm there. When I return
to the office, /etc/resolv.conf has not changed and the notebook works just
fine on the local network.

Something to consider,

Rich

So having that in the routing table means that he has a card that
has no dhcp address????

And it is looking for one???

Harry,

   No thanks are required. It's all part of the FOSS society. We give where
we can and take when we need. It's the underlying fundamental why linux and
the other OSS work as they do.

   Feh! Nonsense! Install it once and use it for years works just as well (if
not better) and lets you be productive more than frustrated.

   Now, if you want to really torture yourself, install Slackware or one of
the other distributions that use BSD-style init scripts rather than
SysV-style init scripts. It took me a month or so to be comfortable and I'm
still learning what's hidden in the corners way in the back. Now the former
make more sense (and are more comfortable) and the latter seem less direct.

So much to learn, so little time,

Rich

Well, for that I think it depends on implimentation. Whether it's looking
for one still depends on if the dhcpclient continues to poll after
failing.

I expect that address in the routing table of any machine that has failed.
It may now have a valid IP, if the client continued and found a response.
It may also flush the routing table upon getting a valid address. Or it
may not. It all depends on how it's coded.

You can also force the dhcp client to poll for an address by typing 
"dhclient" at a root prompt.

Subject: [PLUG] Digital Logic Simulators with schematics
Message-ID: <1104128838.15901.11.camel@timmy>

I am beginning to build a device with logic gates and buttons. Before I
start building the thing in meatspace, I want to simulate it.

I've looked high and low for a free tool. The best interface so far
below belongs to klogic ( http://www.a-rostin.de/klogic/ ), but it
crashes too often to be useful and the interface, while better than some
others, isn't great.

What I want is a program I can draw schematics in and then simulate the
behavior of the circuit when I push buttons and throw switches. I want
to design on the level of gates and flip-flops, not transistors. I'm
just starting out, so I don't need a lot of power or sophisticated
simulations or PCB layout.

Is there anything that can help me?

Thanks,

Evan

I think the gEDA (http://www.embeddedlogic.com/gEDA/) package will do 
what you want. I have not used it myself, but from what I hear, it 
sounds like a capable set of tools.

Happy holidays all.

With some time off I've been trying to add either a group permission
or a sticky bit to a folder that would allow me to give one user
control over an entire directory that other users would be creating
file/dir inside.  I want to delegate work and if I could allow a
sub-admin level on a directory this would help.  Here is a list of
what would happen.

/project1  owned by admin1 he has full control in group 1
/project1/joeuser owned by joeuser he has full control in group 1
/project1/janeuser owned by janeuser she has full control in group 1

now I want to give admin1 full control over all subdirectories as well
as he would help all the users in his directories with any problems.
Basically he needs to be able to modify any of their files.  chmod,
delete, write, mv, etc.

However, I do not want joeuser and janeuser to be able to see or
modify the files of each other.  Best knowledge I'm guessing is if I
put both joeuser and janeuser's direcories in a group that is owned by
the admin with rwx then he would be able to do this and not allow the
joeuser and janeuser in that group.  I can't seem how to assign
additional groups to a particular directory that will always apply.  I
did find that Linux doesn't allow you to be in more then one group at
a time.  Meaning you had to run newgrp each time you wanted to do
anything in that other group.  Is this true?

Is there a way to achieve this on Linux?  I have achieve this in
Windows by places the user full control over a diretory and givening
full recursive permissions on a directory.  How do I do this in Linux.
 Would like to run the file structure on linun and give out
permissions there.

Thanks and I hope you all have a great new year.

Good point. But, since it's not them I'm not as concerned. However, I'll tuck

Another one of those things that, since it works, I haven't gotten around to 
doing the right way. One of these days...

I have six machines in the network. Two are laptops. One of those goes out 
with me from time to time, and even more infrequently may be connected to 
another network and thus would need DHCP. The rest of them stay home, so 
you're right, they could all be staticly assigned (with a wrist strap, of 
course -- can't be too careful where static is concerned!). But, as you say, 
I can always run dhcpd when I need it, which isn't all that often.

One of the machines does have a static number. Some day, when there's a block 
of time, I'll sit down and assign some numbers to the rest of the machines. I 
suppose I should bump that up a bit on the priority list, since it probably 
would have taken less time to do that then the amount of time spent figuring 
out why DHCP didn't work. But then, I wouldn't have learned another couple of 
things.

While on the subject of "when I get some time,"  I tried to use whois 
yesterday and discovered that  I didn't have it! From recent experience, I 
knew that I also didn't have gcc or make. One of the few annoyances I have 
with the SuSE personal distribution. YaST provides a reasonably convenient 
way to get all these things, but this is the first time I've had to. I've 
installed and run successfully, three versions of Red Hat (7.0, 7.1, 8.0), 
and one version of Debian (Woody -- I also tried to get Sarge working). On 
each of those successes, tools like whois and a development environment were 
options I could include during the installation. With SuSE, if I remember 
correctly, Those had to be added later. I guess the only problem with that 
approach is setting aside the time to do it later. 

Speaking of which, I've got some stuff to do. Have a good day!

It's a not uncommon topic for the newsgroups at my web host, many people 
  find that their website is getting hammered by people with wget (or a 
windows equivalent) causing bandwidth overages.  And since most of these 
websites are just labors of love they'll block wget and blacklist ip 
addresses so their users don't cost them more money, the theory being 
that humans don't actually look at most of the website they scrape down. 
  I'd guess that you won't look at most of what's on twiki.org while 
offline but that it's impossible to predict what you will look at, so 
you want to download it all.  twiki.org could be in this bandwidth 
situation.

Try emailing Peter to explain what you were trying to do, he might have 
a solution for your offline needs.

Brent, I am taking the liberty of quoting your mail and my reply to
both you and plug because it is an insightful observation expressed
very well, and all of us can learn from it.

I contacted Peter, and while his response was positive but terse (he
will un-blacklist me, he will put up a note about scrapers on the index
page, I should just take the download), your hypothesis provides a great
explanation of why he might want to restrict wget scrapes of the whole
site.  It is indeed a big site (wikis get that way!) so a few dozen
folks doing what I did would indeed put it into bandwidth overage.  The
fact that he did have *some* page areas set to "no robots" proabably
imply that he might want to set "no robots" for much of the rest of
the site, too!

Next time, I should ask before I scrape.  I should also think about
scraping policies for my own wikis.  

Thanks for the clue;  perhaps if I accumulate enough of them, I will
not need LARTing so often.

I had this same question last week when running down a Fedora core issue.
The 169 is a built in place holder(yeah, don't ask me why))
even flushing the tables doesn't remove it.
Or at least this was the explanation from my Boss when I asked.

If you have some knowledge of Verilog, I'd skip the schematics and model
your circuit directly in Verilog.  You could use Icarus Verilog to simulate
and GTKWave to view the simulation results.

If you don't know Verilog, I can't think of a Linux solution.  If you have
a Windows machine available, you could download the web version of Altera's
Quartus.  It has schematic capture and simulation.  I think Xilinx has 
something similar.  In either case, I suspect you might find the learning
curve rather steep.

Thanks for reply..

Finally, a few brain cell woke up and the command I couldn't remember


cardctl

And I believe it loads with pcmcia card manager.

I was going to put part of man but, I don't have it on this machine.
<no pcmcia>


Thanks again..

One of the sorest spots in hardware support is running
Webcams on a platform other than Windows. It can often
be done, but the documentation is scarce. If you have
an unused router connection, however, an IP Web cam
may solve this problem easily, such as the NC-1000
that I purchased from the King of Gadgets. The base is
sturdy. It apparently does not work with Konqueror,
although there is no trouble with Mozilla. (At the
moment I am using it on FreeBSD, and it does not even
have full Java support.)

In my experience, the straight Debian install is the clear choice.  There
seem to be issues with the apt sources for Knoppix and one must jump
through some confusing hoops in order to make it a regular Debian
installation.

Also, if this is a desktop system, you're going to want to run unstable or
testing in order to get fairly recent versions of the software you like to
run.

How can I find out what the font is in Gentoo? Once I know that, how can

If you are building something with logic parts, like TTL chips (at
least that's what it sounds like you are doing to me) verilog is
probably not what you want.  It kind of sounds like you just want to
draw a few gates, hook 'em up, and see what waveforms come out.  You
could try the gEDA tools suggested, or another open source option is
Electric:

I used it more extensively than I ever wanted to a couple years ago. 
I don't recommend it for anything big, but for a small project it'll
do.

I, in fact, have fried the motherboard this way.

I was the (heh, _the_ ) Egghead Hardware Technician. In one case, I was
trying to diagnose a problem. For some reason, I was plugging and
unplugging the PS/2 mouse while the computer was chugging away. It was
faster than turning it off, of course. The specific computer's name
escapes me but it was an elite name-brand model (not your average IBM
even.) I plugged and unplugged the mouse about six or seven times, until
on the final time (why is it always the final time) I was horrified to
see a spark shoot between the two items (mouse and PS/2 connector). No,
I hadn't been scuffing my feet around the office.

The computer let out an anguished 'beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee'
until I turned it off. I think the replacement mobo was about $450, and
I believe the customer had someone else install it.

Subject: [PLUG] h2xs - new directory structure?
Message-ID: <20041228171443.GB14120@loki.dsl-only.net>

Hello Linux folkz,

I'm sorry if this is not 100% Linux related. However ...
Recently, upgrading to perl v5.8.5 I've noticed that h2xs lays out module
directory structure in a quite different way than before.
Prior to this I could create a module e.g. Data::Loader
h2xs -XA -n Data::Loader
And it would create directory Data, then subdirectory Loader with Loader.pm
module and other files.
The full path to the module looks like /Data/Loader/Loader.pm
If I want to create another module e.g. Data::Reader
h2xs would put it into /Data/Reader/Reader.pm
Which is logically correct.

How the same command produces directory Data-Loader with service files and 
subdirectory lib in which it creates subdirectory Data in which it creates
the module Loader.pm
The full path to the module looks like /Data-Loader/lib/Data/Loader.pm
For another module e.g. Data::Reader it will be
/Data-Reader/lib/Data/Reader.pm
Why? Makes no sense to me. What the hell is going on with h2xs?

Thank you in advance for any clues or practical help.

"It depends" is the definitive answer. :) Knoppix comes with utilities and 
configurations that you may find useful, like QTParted, the f-prot 
installer/updater, and other stuff I forget. Knoppix's installer and hardware 
detection are great. If you're not familiar with Debian, Knoppix is a good 
friendly introduction. If you're already a Debian guru, eh, why bother with 
Knoppix. See this knoppix forum for installation help:

I have looked and dont seem to be seeing if there is a
way to make wget ignore the robots.txt file and grab a
file or directory from a site.  I was just thinking of
this because of the previous thread on wget.  Anyway,
let me know and thanks in advance.

The 169.254.0.0/16 network has been allocated by the IANA for link-local
usage for a number of years now.  The idea being to allow systems to connect
to an IP network with "zero-configuration".

    http://www.zeroconf.org/

On RedHat (FC-2, FC-3, and I think RHEL-3) systems, you can disable the
169.254/16 nonsense by putting "NOZEROCONF=yes" in /etc/sysconfig/network.

When TCP/IP was only installed/maintained on large, multi-user systems
the need to manually configure an IP address and network mask (and possibly
a default gateway or run some program to find a route off the local network)
was not considered a problem.  However, as the number of IP devices began
to grow, this started to become a chore.  BOOTP and DHCP were developed
(among other reasons) to give network admins the ability to reconfigure
IP nodes without having to physically visit the machine.

LAN administrators noted (quite correctly) that Novel IPX and the Appletalk
networks didn't need all this per-host maintainence and tweaking.  (Small)
Mac networks were great -- you plug it in, and it worked!  This is the
genesis of the "zero configuration" project in the TCP/IP world.

If not, perhaps, a half decade or so too late.  These days DHCP can be
found in almost everything and is relatively mature.  Of course, the other
stuff, like service advertisements, are a really nice feature, although I
have yet to actually use them.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0412281456590.28676@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I want a copy of my signature as a bit-mapped graphic file that I can use
to "sign" letters sent as pdf files. Thinking that the digital camera would
do the job, I signed a sheet of white paper and photographed it using the
built-in flash and a high-intensity desk lamp for illumination. All images
came out with a non-uniform, greyish-blue background.

   Since I have had need for a scanner perhaps three or four times over the
past decade I really cannot justfiy the cost of buying one. Is there someone
in the Portland area with a scanner who will let me scan in the signature
then e-mail the result to me?

Thanks,

Rich

I think Kinkos and the like offer scanning services like that.

Of course, they ARE owned by FedEx, so there's a possibility the image
will be lost or destroyed between the store and your house.  :-P

Keith,

   I tried. There is such variation in the background color that I cannot
select it all at once. When I try using the rectangular selector I cannot
then change the background color. This is all in gimp-2.2.0.

   I'm sure that those more experienced with the GIMP can do it, but I gave
up after a half-hour. Perhaps I should zoom way in and do it pixel-by-pixel.

Thanks,

Rich

   I've never had FedEx or UPS lose a package. The USPS a couple of times,

Try the "posterize" function in GIMP--it basically takes an image and
flattens the color into a more limited number of colors, which, after
converting to black and white, should render it easier to work with.

I made the NAC logo using a similar technique from the original:

Hey Rich,

Here's a thought. How about taking that picture and tweaking it in gimp? 
  I'm sure you have enough contrast and resolution to get to where you

   Ta-da! The eraser works. And, much better than trying to change the color
of each pixel to white.

Count your blessings.

The only time I've shipped something with FedEx it was seven computers
to the East Coast a few months ago.  One arrived in working order.
Three arrived damaged by reparable.  One of those three was hit with
such force the frame was bent.  Another with enough force to knock out a
RAM stick.  We're not talking 4' drops here... we're talking a lot more
force.

The remaining three systems were completely lost.  After a month and a
half long claims/tracking ordeal, I received a check in the mail for
them.

UPS delivered the remaining 17 systems, all undamaged.  None lost.  All
on time (which happened to be a day or two earlier than FedEx).

During this ordeal and a subsequent part-time job with a local Mailboxes
Etc type place, I learned a lot about how FedEx works... and would
STRONGLY advice people to stay FAR away from them WHENEVER possible.

  I'm glad you found a work-around. In the future, you could come to my

I'm looking for a simple way to display the total

The output should be text.

The reason for this is I have a custom distro that is

I'm trying out the "scoring" technique of procmail to weed out german 
language schpam, and I tried this to score messages based on common german 
whole words, but it doesn't work. What am I doing wrong?

:0
* -5^0
* 1^1 B ?? <mit>
* 1^1 B ?? <[Dd]u>
* 1^1 B ?? <[Aa]us>
* 1^1 B ?? <das>
* 1^1 B ?? <auf>
* 1^1 B ?? <sich>
* 1^1 B ?? <und>

* 1^1 B ?? <der>
{
  :0 fwh
  | formail -I"Subject: GERMAN SCHPAM: ${SUBJ_}"
  :0
  $SPAMFOLDER
}

The variable SUBJ_ is defined as:
SUBJ_=`formail -xSubject: \
  | expand | sed -e 's/^[ ]*//g' -e 's/[ ]*$//g'`

and SPAMFOLDER is correct (these work on other messages.)

The test message had two "mit"s, a "das", a "macht",  a "sich" and a 
"Du", which should have made the score positive. Am I wrong in assuming 
that whole words are identified by text in angle brackets? I don't want 
words like "wonderful" to count as a "der."

Try this:

#################
#!/bin/bash
#
# rpmdeptree - Script to generate a list of dependencies for requested
# packages.  (Pass -a for all.)
#
# Written by Wil Cooley <wcooley at nakeedape.cc>

for rpm in $(rpm -q $@|sort); do
    printf 'Package: %-67s {{{\n' ${rpm}
    for prov in $(rpm -q --provides ${rpm}|cut -f1 -d' '|sort|uniq); do
        printf '  Provides: %s\n' ${prov}

    done
    printf "}}}\n"
done

printf "# %s:foldmethod=marker" "vim"
#################

It's slow, but I think it gives you what you want.  Okay, here's the fun
part--if you redirect the output to a file:

rpmdeptree -a > rpm-deps.txt

Then use Vim to view it, it will fold each Package section so you can more
easily scan the list; it'll also tell you how many lines are in the fold,
so you can get an idea of how many provides and dependencies there are. 
Use 'zo' and 'zc' to open and close the folds.

I never could have imagined what would happen when I
installed Debian--by FTP, in this case. After the
download completed, the installer began asking some
questions to finish up the installation, as I
expected. I got to monitor detection, and unwisely
assumed that it would be detected; but instead, the
system locked up. I rebooted, expecting that the
system would come up in text mode and I would have to
continue from there.

This, however, is NOT what happened. The installation
resumed, and started downloading packages again!
Ridiculous! Packages that were already installed! I
pressed the power switch, and rebooted into Windows.

Does anyone know how to solve this problem--that is,
to get out of the package installation and continue
with the final configuration? If not, I may conclude
that Debian isn't worth a try.

I think you can add a "-erobots=off" to your command line to ignore

If a bootloader has been installed, and configured to boot the debian
install, you can probably just boot the system, log in as root, and
run base-config (/usr/sbin/base-config if you'r path hasn't been set
correctly yet).

Hi Robert,

Your experience sounds very similar to a number of abortive Debian 
installs I've tried over the years.

If you're installing stable Debian, or "woody," I advise against it. 
The new stable release (currently testing, "sarge") is due any day now, 
and although it will be some months in all likelihood, if you plan on 
using your system for a while there is plenty to be gained by starting 
with sarge.  Blah blah, others will contend that sarge is not yet quite 
so secure, but assess your risk realistically.

Another big problem is the conservative kernels included with many 
Debian "official" installations.  Try searching for the "Debian on Dell" 
site at Oregon State for one possible example of an updated kernel. 
Another way is to use Knoppix to boot to Linux, and then run debootstrap 
(kind of a high-maintenance way to do it).  A lot of these 
hardware-compatibility problems are solved with smarter, newer kernels.

Finally, if all the above fails but you want sweet sweet Debianness on 
your box with all the graphical hoo-hahs as well, try using Xandros or 
Ubuntu, two Debian-based commercial distros (with accordingly 
tricked-out and better-supported installers.

Best,

Randall

This works (boy, is it slow).  Not exactly what I expected but 
reading it through show me why it is so slow.

Neat option on the folding but the system I am running on doesn't have
vim.

Never mind... I resolved this one. The solution is to add parentheses and 
escape the brakets, e.g.:
 :0
 * -5^0
 * 1^1 B ?? ()\<mit\>
 * 1^1 B ?? ()\<[Dd]u\>
etc.

I don't know what the parentheses are for, but I found this notation on a 
web site and they were not explained. Anyway, this recipe now traps 
german language messages and files them in the spam filter. Now I'm going 
to try it on spanish and korean, and get rid of those.

Try umount on the directory from a root console - I get that some times when
I am connected to the sons XP machine and he turns it off. I normally use
Smb4k to mount the share, and umnount it from there, except when the
other system is off.

You can get out of "configure apt" in this way, but
then it just drops you down into a shell. X is not yet
ready to start.

What I'm likely to do is just to download the
installation CD's while I'm working on other things.
That way the installer can just go through the whole
thing again in a short period of time. (Unless, of
course, I get advice about how to do it more easily.)

I'm compiling an old C program and I'm getting "unresolved reference" 
errors for pow and sqrt during the link step. The module with the problem 
does include <math.h>, but I'm guessing I need to also include a library

Does anyone know which one that might be?

The answer hides in plain sight, and is prominently located in the 
manual.  Pick that specific step out of the main installation menu.

Downloading full images with Bittorent is about twice
as fast as fetching packages by FTP, and it doesn't
kill the computer--you can use it for other things
while it is downloading. And you can share these
images with a friend not connected to your LAN (and
that's most people) if you emerge from the experience
with the impression that Debian is worthwhile.

Your friend can be given CD-R's. Save the CD-RW's for
yourself--they can be rewritten at least 500 times
(conservative estimate).

Thanks I will.  And if that doesn't work I'm at the console to do a reboot 
which in the past has worked to fix the @#$%^&* Windows stuff that has 
broken.

Since it is a server in the NOC the Smb4k isn't an option.  All command 
line stuff here on the Linux boxen.

I believe I've done it. I just installed a bunch of font packages. I

As has been stated before on this list, the debian install CDs will
give you a _very_ antiquated system by today's standards.  You aren't
likely to be happy with what you get unless you do a dist-upgrade
(which is almost always painless, but it entails downloading the
latest version... which means _everything_ when you start with a CD
install).

A better alternative would be to download the .deb's from a mirror
such as debian.orst.edu and point the installer at that local source
of packages.
If you aren't on broadband, it would be worthwhile to find a fast
connection to use for the installation--you're welcome to come use
mine, but it'd probably be quite a trip (I live in Corvallis).

Depends on if you're using the old boot-floppies installer (yes, it 
comes on CD, boot-floppies should give you an idea of that installer's 
age).  The new installer, debian-installer, gives you a sarge system.

How do you propose resolving dependencies before you know what you want?

I wouldn't expect to resolve dependencies before installation, but
rather to mirror the mirror.

You and your friends will be unhappy with 7 CD's of 3-year-old software.
As others have pointed out, you will be happy with the sarge installer:

Subject: [PLUG] OpenLDAP "merge" command?
Message-ID: <9e0a3578041229160431c02bc4@mail.gmail.com>

I have a very large address book that was exported from MS Outlook,
imported into Thunderbird so that I could then export it into LDIF
format to then import into an OpenLDAP server.  The problem is that
there are numerous duplicates so doing an ldapadd fails as soon as the
next identical DN is encountered.  Does anyone know of a way to add an
entry and if it already exists then simply update the information with
the next occurance?  I would even be happy if it just ignored the
duplicate DN as long as it continued processing the other entries in
the file.
Thanks,

I have had a number of occasions to work with LDIF address books, where I've 
had to distribute them to users with different needs. One of the export 
possibilities from Netscape (so I'm assuming it's in Thunderbird), is csv, 
which is easily imported into Excel, and thus, I assume, into an Open Office 
spreadsheet. Once there, sorting is, obviously, simple. While I don't have 
time to look it up until later tonight, I think there's a function similar to 
UNIQUE in SQL. That might give you a way to eliminate the duplicates.

Hope this helps.

I've now got my new notebook (IBM T42, yay!) and I need to create software

Apparently this is how IBM avoids sending media with the system.

This is a 1-time operation! Or so I'm told by IBM support.

SOOOOO.

Is there any difference in the quality of writeable CD-ROM media?

I'd like to get this thing backed up so I can proceed with configuring it

Please advise.

There are many Debian people on this list, so I
thought I'd update my experiences. I'm using Debian
"Sarge" at the moment.

I was able to complete the installation by giving
exact sweep frequencies for my monitor. Unfortunately,
KDE comes up at 800 x 600, 85 Hz. The monitor is
capable of doing 1280 x 1024 @ 60 Hz, and I would like
to get at least 1024 x 768. I can't change it in KDE.
How else can I do it?

I use CUPS for printing, with an Ethernet printer.
Apparently Debian does not have its own CUPS package,
which does not surprise me. When I compile it from
source code for a non-PS printer, something is
apparently missing:

"CUPS 1.1.15 and higher no longer include the
PostScript RIP filter, pstoraster, necessary for
printing PostScript, PDF, text, or HP-GL/2 files to
non-PostScript printers. You must also install a
version of Ghostscript with the 'cups' raster driver
(gdevcups.c) to print to non-PostScript printers."

How can I get this done with Debian?

Other than that, Debian installation is
straightforward, and its reputation for being
difficult to use is unjustified.

I usually just hack the Display section(s) in /etc/X11/XF86Config-4

        SubSection "Display"
                Depth           16
                Modes           "1600x1200" "800x600" "640x480"
        EndSubSection
 
Defines my 16-bit mode for one screen.  You probably just need to add
"1280x1024" to the front of the Modes line(s), and restart X.

The above assumption is incorrect.   The first link on this page will
take you to a how-to that looks pretty good (and fits with my
experiences, although I did not use that howto):

> which does not surprise me. When I compile it from

Once you become more acustomed to Debian, the absence of a package
should be quite surprising :).  You can use apt to search the package

     apt-cache search cups

There are rather vast differences.  For more detail on this topic than
you can possibly imagine, go to the CD Freaks media forums at:

http://club.cdfreaks.com/forumdisplay.php?f=33

In short, the media that is the best for most drives is Taiyo Yuden
CD-R, which can be had retail here in Portland at SuperDigital:

http://www.superdigital.com/audio/index.php

Or, for better pricing online, you might try:

http://www.supermediastore.com/

In any case, once you've made your "one" copy, you should duplicate it
immediately.  No matter how good a CD is, rolling over it with your
office chair is likely to be fatal.  (Not that I've done this, mind
you...)

   Don't know if this would be useful to you circuit designers, but I thought
I'd pass it on in case you were unaware of it:

"mpcirc is a MetaPost package for drawing electrical and electronic circuit
diagrams. Its output Postscript files work best when included in TeX files
because then the package can fully use TeX's fonts and mathematical
typesetting capabilities."

   I found it on a list of Slackware packages but it is not
distribution-specific (of course).

Subject: [PLUG] apache vhosts + ipv6
Message-ID: <41D47837.1030106@schluting.com>


So, I upgraded apache and added ipv6 support.

First, the new apache borked on my VirtualHost style.
I had been doing:
NameVirtualHost *
<VirtualHost *>
options
</VirtualHost>

I had to change the *'s to my IP to make it actually work...

Second, making it listen on my IPv6 interface broke SSL somehow..
After many trials/errors, I came up with:
Listen 0.0.0.0:80
Listen :: 80
<IfDefine SSL>
Listen 0.0.0.0:443
Listen :: 443
</IfDefine>

This works.. finally.
So, when visiting via IPv6 its just serving the default page, not my "main 
page" which happens to be a VirtualHost. I ended up making:
<VirtualHost [2001:470:1f01:ffff::ed]:80> and just pointing it at the correct 
directory.
It all seems to work, but what a pita. I tried listing NameVirtualHost with 
both addrs, and then:
<VirtualHost <ip addr>:80 [2001:470:1f01:ffff::ed]:80>
The docs say this works.. but it again simply serves up the default directory.
I can't seem to make vhosts work with IPv6, is the real issue then.

Is there a way to say "listen on all interfaces, and treat vhosts the same, no 
matter what IP they come from". It should 'just work' like this, with my 
previous configuration of:
Listen *:80
Listen *:443
And vhosts stuff with *

But the newest apache complains that things are being defined more than once if 
you don't use the IP addr, or 0.0.0.0. I'm assuming this is because it is 
trying to "register" a single vhost with both IP addrs. :)

Ideas? Seems like people running vhosts with 2 IP on the same machine should 
have run into the same thing.

   I've never seen this before and it's highly irritating. Perhaps someone
here has encountered this and has a solution. Running OO.o-1.1.3. Nothing
special about the document I'm preparing, but almost every time I open the
document to work on it text in the middle of a page will be shifted down to
the next page leaving a large, empty space on the previous page. Happens
multiple times in the document.

Any ideas why?

See if you have "widow and orphan control" enabled, under Format - paragraph - 
text flow. "do not split paragraph" or "keep with next paragraph" can also 
gum things up. Just uncheck everything and see what happens.

more than a "feature"  Widow and orphan control is a useful feature 
for preserving readability.  

Your problem could have been that the setting was to too many lines.

   Nope. Always the standard 2 lines. It used to be on by default in
WordPerfect. In OO.o it's off by default.

   I'm aware of the benefits of widow and orphan control. The mis-behavior
was to what I referred as a mis-named "feature".

One of the first things most people want to do after a
successful installation of Debian is to install more
software. Not surprisingly, this is what I wanted to
do, too.

I noted that there was no TV-viewing application. I
issued the command apt-get install xawtv, and it was
not done, although this application exists even in
Woody. I therefore suppose my sources.list needs some
attention. (I am uing Sarge and have five downloaded
CD's, which could be used for something other than
supporting coffee cups, although I would like to
sample from "unstable" applications as well.)

My reading of the documentation is giving me some
ideas. If anyone would like to divulge the contents of
their sources.list or give advice related to this,
however, it would be welcome.

What does your /etc/apt/sources.list look like?

I am seeing xawtv in my package list.  My sources.list contains:

  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main non-free contrib

   Well, then. That explains it. Several years ago I had a dialog with the
OO.o developers about copying winWord. Why, I asked them, would someone want
to switch to a different application that offered no improvements over what
they were already using? Price is not an issue since the cost of winWord is
built into the system they buy.

   The response was that users would not switch if there was a learning
curve. So, OO.o had to be as close to winWord as possible.

   I suggested that was a self-defeating view and that people were not that
stupid. If they had something better, they'd learn to use it without
hesitation. Besides, most of us use only 10-20% of the available features in
a "suite" such as OO.o.

   I lost the discussion so I gave up. Too bad the OO.o developers didn't
take WordPerfect as the model to emulate.

Happy New Year,

Rich

Jim,

   Google: "+usb thumb + linux" ->

         <http://www.linuxforum.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=86323>
among many others.

   Also, I think in was in a 2003 issue of Linux Journal where a step-by-step
HOWTO was published. Check the archives at <http://www.linuxjournal.com/>.

   They are seen as ttyUSBx; mine is ttyUSB1 on my notebook. Make sure you
have the usb modules loaded first. There's a core module and two others.
Your unit will use one of those two or the other. I don't remember how to
identiy which one it wants.

   Try looking up your unit's brand on google, too.

HTH,

ttyUSBx??

That would make sense for a USB->Serial converter, but not a USB thumb
drive.

Mine shows up as /dev/sda with the partition being /dev/sda1.

They use the USB Mass Storage driver.

   Mea culpa! I was still on the beginning of the coffee. You're right, of
course. Mine's /dev/sda1, too.

   I must have been thinking of the USB-connected Handspring PDA.

That's the fun bit with Debian--all those packages.

Like you and unlike Russell, I'm running Sarge (e.g. Testing, soon to be
Stable).  Mine looks like this:
 # The basics
 deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian sarge main contrib non-free
 deb http://security.debian.org/ sarge/updates main contrib non-free

 # MPlayer, acroread, flash-player
 deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ testing main

 # Blackdown Java
 #deb http://ftp.tux.org/pub/java/debian woody non-free
 deb http://ftp.tux.org/pub/java/debian sid non-free

 # WineX, others
 deb http://emiml.ath.cx/ debian-sid-pakiety/

 # MiniSIP phone
 deb http://www.minisip.org/debian/ binary/

I've got a bunch of other stuff commented out.  But xawTV shows up. 
If nothing else, add the Marillat repository.  It makes your system
ever so much more useful, with the ability to play most videos, view
Flash in Mozilla and use Acrobat Reader.

If you're looking for anything else, check http://www.apt-get.org

   Yeah. It's my fiancee's Handspring. Great unit.

   BTW, I learned that the easist way to have users write to ports like
/dev/pilot is to add their username to the group that owns /dev/ttyUSBx.
Maintains the relationship after upgrading the system.

Mixing and matching versions has been known to cause problems in Debian 
unless you know what you're doing.  Woody, sarge or sid: pick one.

There is a closer (and considerably faster) mirror...

deb ftp://ftp.oregonstate.edu/debian/ unstable main
deb-src ftp://ftp.oregonstate.edu/debian/ unstable main

Note that using Oregon State's mirror doesn't make you any less of a

What distro are you using? Some of the newer 2.6-based distros that use
the HAL deamon are fairly automated with respect to USB devices. FC3 will
automatically create a mount point (/media/usbdisk) and add an entry to
/etc/fstab when a USB flash drive is plugged in. Then all you have to do
is "mount /media/usbdisk". You should "umount /media/usbdisk" before removing 
the flash drive.

Most of the lines in my sources.list had been
commented out. I changed this, and added some sources
that were suggested.

The TV card is still a problem. I haven't been able to
use xawtv on any platform. I got good results with an
earlier version of TVtime, but the present version
doesn't work with older TNT2 cards such as mine
without an updated driver. NVIDIA offers one, which
may solve the problem.

Formerly I also used kdetv. This may have been
deprecated. I'm pretty sure Mythtv is available from
somewhere, though not from any of the sources in my
sources.list.

So will FC3 remove the /etc/fstab entry once the USB device is removed?

kdetv became something like qtvision or something similar...

That doesn't make sense...

It would be set to not auto mount, so you manually mount and unmount it.
To add and remove the entry from fstab for every insert and removal
wouldn't make sense and would completely defeat the purpose of the entry
in the first place...

   Never a dull moment here. :-) I was waiting for the machine to do its
thing so I used a finger to wipe dust off the ledge where the floppy drive
is mounted. My finger went a little too far and brushed against the
surface-mounted reset switch just enough to trip it. So much for up-time,
eh?

   Does anyone know of an after-market switch cover that can be glued onto
the case and prevent klutzes like me from inadvertently rebooting the
machine? If there is no such thing, I'll just have to fabricate a custom
solution.

Thanks,

It does remove the entry from /etc/fstab when the device is removed. 
The device is no longer available that is no point in keeping it around. 
  The HAL daemon responds to the new device, adds the fstab entry, and 
sends out a notification.  On FC3, the gnome-volume-manager responds to 
the notification and mounts the drive.  When it works, it is pretty smooth.

I would guess that it depends on the case, so fabrication may be your best 
option. The two machines I have under my desk each have different profiles 
for their power and reset buttons. The same solution would not work on both.

My first thought was a simple hinge glued over something to make it stand away 
from the case by enough to clear the button. It wouldn't look pretty, but it 
would do the job. Or, maybe that idea will spark another one from someone 
else.

I'm not familar with the Hal deamon so I'm not sure if it would auto
mount the device or not. I got the impression that it did. Suse has
something similar that detects the device and then automatically mounts
it for you.

True, it would defeat the purpose but I'd hate to see my fstab getting
cluttered with extra enties especially if I never used that device
again.

Doh...I hate it when that happens...Another opps I'll admit to is not plugging 
a system into the "battery" backed up outlets on an UPS and only getting 
surge suppression protection. That killed my uptime... :-O

I do try to learn from my mistakes and have never repeated one where battery 
backup is concerned. It's come in handy as we have a couple of interns in the 
office and they almost made the same mistake one time. 

Happy New Year,

Tony

If you wish to not be emailed directly, you shouldn't set the REPLY-TO
header.  When REPLY-TO is set to include you, I'm going to include
you.  :-)

FC3 doesn't auto-mount USB flash drives. It only auto-creates the
mount point and the /etc/fstab entry, and then auto-destroys these
when the device is removed. It's kind of funky but it seems to work.

There may also be a way to enable auto-mounting but I've not found
it, not that I've looked very hard.

Mouser has switch covers.  Check page 1000 of the latest catalog.  Omron
part numbers A16ZA-5050 and A16ZJ-5050.  ~$4.

galen,

   I should have thought of them! They've had all the specialized items I've
sought over the past few years.

   One box, however, has the switches surface mounted rather than depressed.
And, they're an odd shape, too. I think that I'll build clear plastic
protectors for these guys. But, I'll check Mouser first.

Many thanks -- and happy New Year,

Rich

Cool.  I'll have to hook them into my CRM114 discriminator to make
sure no one shuts off my machine without the correct three-letter

Do you use Gnome or KDE?  With Gnome, auto-mounting is controlled 
through 'Preferences', 'Removable Storage'.  There are options for 
mounting removable drives and handling CDs, DVDs, and photos.

I should have been clearer. I hate auto-mounting. I use KDE and
it has an "autorun" utility for auto-mounting CDs. The first thing
I do after an install is to disable it.

I will be looking at tools in about a month. But so far the Oracad

I don't know what your use it, but for me I need to create netlists,
