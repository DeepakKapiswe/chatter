Great, I fixed my version and downloaded the code from the 
posted one.  I haven't studied style sheets since I only 
took a 1 credit course on making web pages at PCC.
Thankfully, information from here in the last couple of 
days has added to that.

In C programming I learned to put the literal to the left of 
an equals symbol in a comparison so that if I accidentally 
typed the assignment symbol it wouldn't compile, this saves 
the costly trouble of tracking down a logic error.  A tight 
syntax language probably would have caught my missing tag, 
then again, if a hanging anchor is a valid case it wouldn't
get caught as a syntax error.

BTW:  Anyone checking out ITT tech's new computer forensics/
      network security Bachelor's degree offering?  I don't
      know if ITT tech is accredited where it's not the only
      place I want to check the ratings of considering that
      Sprint may hire me to work in Virginia offering a $5k
      education benefit for taking one or two classes during
      the period of employment.  I'd like to stay in Oregon
      as it's less risky and I avoid the car problem, but
      not knowing what's going on with the economy here
      I don't know how I can.  I'm a debt free college 
      Junior with a general studies degree, but I'm 
      basically broke too.

Well, went, had a lot of fun. - went flying twice - once in my car and once
in the airplane, but the first is a long story. . .

The ground to air to air to ground link never really made it - small
helicopter and no room for a battery for the laptop, so batteries died and
they headed home pretty quick. They had the poor guy in the heli strap all
his equipment to his body with twist ties (so nothing falls out and hits the
rotor) and he didn't have a door on his side. I believe some more pics are
coming, but afaik this is all of them at the moment.
http://students.washington.edu/dejann/karl/
http://www.andrewhitchcock.org/gallery/2003wirelessfieldday

The SW folks did manage to get a link from floor 67 of the Columbia Tower
(the big black building) to alki point relayed to magnolia. A pretty good
distance. I believe speeds dropped down to 2 mbps, but it was a couple miles
line of sight between each, and I don't think our Internet access was that
fast.
A 24db parabolic antenna was set up at the Columbia tower - and Alki
connected with a 15db yagi and was retransmitting through a 24db parabolic
to Magnolia. Pretty good range.
Some more pics here.

The airborn netstumbler was enlightening. We found "a few" nodes. Over
3000ft agl, there wasn't much that we could receive.
http://seattlewireless.net/misc/war_flying.zip

Equipment for the stumble was a tiny 5 db omni mounted (via magnets and
electrical tape) upside down on the bottom of the plane fed into a 30 mw
Orinoco. We were getting roughly 5-6 ap's a second shortly after takeoff,
but this rate fell off pretty sharply once we achieved the
3-4 thousand foot range. Best part was when we got clearance to circle right
in Boing Field's takeoff path. ATC was diverting 737s, etc around us. t'was
great.
Have a great long weekend.

The snaphsot looks OK.  You have "hide deleted messages" unchecked in

Get a new hobby. The fact that I happen to be writing this e-mail on my 
only remaining Windows box instead of one of my numerous Linux boxen 
doesn't invalidate my opinion, nor does it change the fact that the vast 
majority of users are willing to register to help mitigate some the 
affects of the network abuses that have been going on lately, nor does 
it make me a troll.

He's missing the toolbar and menubar.  I don't see anything obvious in
the list of deleted files that would have removed it.  These things are
Bonobo objects, but I don't see any Bonobo-related RPMs in his list.

It's not your money.  The money is a means of exchange provided by the
people of this country (i.e. the government) to ease the trade of goods
and services.  The goods themselves also belong to the people as products
of the land merely converted by the efforts of people from one state to
another, however, for the sake of managing scarcity the people use a
coercive police state to enforce property relations.

So you are also an anarchist?

I would probably call myself an anarchist, but I also agree with the
statement that in order to be an anarchist one must first be a socialist.
That is to say, in the same sense that we must be eternally vigilant to
retain our liberties in a society with coersion, we must be eternally
vigilant to retain our civilization in a society without a coercive state
(i.e. pull together to prevent the reign of the law of the jungle).

Credits to the poor are the very least (literally) that we can do to help
offset the gross injustices of state-enforced property relations.

I highly recommend reading up on the Nixon (yes, THAT Nixon) Negative
Income Tax plan.  If you must retain capitalist ideals and a coercive
state (and you simply cannot have the former without the latter), a system
like that should be in place to help alleviate the suffering caused by the
necessary underemployment.

Josh,

No reason to panic.  Drives don't have to have partitions and are perfectly 
happy without them, which means that you can make a filesystem on them and 
access the files without weird consequence.  I can't explain the 
inconsistency in the mount commands on the different systems with authority.  
But it just seems like a quirk of the particular hardware/software 
combination and not a reason for concern.  Maybe the IBM drive controller 
internally treats a drive without partitions as a drive with a single 
partition and the newer version of mount retrieves this information from the 
drive whereas the previous version didn't?

Don't worry,

Mark

It appears that someone (probably a spam generating virus) send a

His verifier didn't recognized the sending address, and so responded 
with the correct email.

What's not working? Would this not stop most spam from getting to him?

Um, because it WASN'T spam.  It was a legitimate automated message.  And
it didn't get to him.

Forced verification doesn't work because it assumes that legitimate email
only ever comes from a human being who reads replies and responds
intelligently.

Subject: [PLUG] Q: comparison of video formats
Message-ID: <16212.15242.958764.822432@vzavenue.net>

I'm having difficulty finding the answers to my questions via the
standard channels.  Most of my Google searches give me sales
websites.  There isn't much on the PLUG archives, except for some
discussion of MPlayer about 6 months ago.

So what I'm trying to do is offload the contents of several DV tapes,
and make a combined video of probably about 45 minutes to an hour,
which would go on a CD-ROM to be copied and distributed to a few dozen
people.  There might be other material on the same CD (e.g., JPEGs
from still pictures, and text).

So what I'm trying to decide is the format I should use.

The DV camera uses IEEE 1394 ("Firewire"), so I was kind of limited on
choice of machines.  My lab has a Windows box with an IEEE 1394 port,
so I just plugged in the camera to see what would happen.  The PC
brought up Microsoft Windows Media Maker, and I was able to download
the movies.  The tool also looks fairly capable.  The biggest downside
is it only produces the proprietary Microsoft WMV format.

Then I installed a CD that came with the DV camera, with its own
tools.  Then I had the choice of producing either AVI or MPEG-1
files.  One annoying problem was that it saves the files in raw DV
format, which is about 25Mb/s, and once the file reaches 4GiB, Windows
(XP) thinks there's no more space, and the program stops downloading
and starts converting what it's got, the result being that my movie is
broken into 19-minute chunks.  Presumably I could merge them back once
they are converted into MPEGs.

So I produced both MPEG-1 and WMV files.  These were fairly low
quality settings.  Both had tons of Moire patterns, jaggies and other
artifacts, but I couldn't see a significant difference between them.
The WMV audio was noticeably worse -- crowd noises seemed to have
strange resonances which I associate with low-bitrate MP3s; maybe some
fiddling with quality settings could fix this.  But what is
significant is that the WMV file was about 20 times smaller!  A 12
minute clip was 9MB in WMV and around 200MB in MPEG-1.

I wouldn't even think about using WMV, as some of the intended
recipients are non-MS users (Linux, Mac or otherwise).  But then I
heard that MPlayer can play WMVs as well.

So my questions are:

1. Does anyone else have experience with WMVs as compared to other
video compression formats?  Is WMV really that much better (in terms
of compression ratio)?  Or am I missing something?  (Perhaps the
Windows Media Player converts the MPEG-1 into WMV before passing it to
the WMV render engine, so they look the same to me, but a native
MPEG-1 decoder would look better?)

2. Are there patent issues with WMV?  Would the Gnuistically-correct
thing to do be to avoid it altogether?

3. If I go with the WMV (for the better compression), how badly am I
screwing my non-MS friends?  Should I just tell them to get MPlayer?
(I've heard differing opinions on how hard it is to get running,
though it seems to have improved.)  Is WMV supported on Macs (or do
they play the same game and just support Quicktime)?

4. Does anyone have experience with Moviex?  I found a website that
mentioned this -- it is MPlayer combined with a minimal Linux setup
that you can use to make a bootable CD-ROM for about 8MB.  (Then
again, people are less likely to bother watching the video if they
need to reboot.)

5. If I stick with MPEG-1, is there a way to make a VCD with "extra
content" (the JPEGs and text files) so that someone can pop it into a
DVD player that understands VCDs, and see the video, but if they pop
it into a computer, they can access the other stuff?

Thanks for your help.

Ok, a couple of things.
.wmv blows, don't even consider using it if you want anything resembling
quality. PITA for macs too.

re: the 4gb limit - convert the drive to ntfs, that should get rid of that
problem. Of course if this is a dual boot. . .  file size limit is something
like 20,000 terrabytes or some insane amount that you will never be able to
fill (note, this WILL come back to haunt me in 15-20 years)

There is a great program called virtualdub - free and is painfully easy to
use. Runs on windows. Very small.
I'd say capture raw avi, then open the file in virtualdub and compress.
There are a bunch of effects you can do with virtusldub too - check their
website for more goodies. You can capture too, as long as you aren't running
an ati card (because their video in/out chipsets, much like their drivers,
lick the salt off of a harry camel's nutsack, but enough ranting for now. .
. .) You'll probably have to do some work with the sound to make it sync,
but whatever. Or just capture how you are now ;)
Something like xvid 2-pass / divx 5 2-pass will give you quite nice results.
Since you're going for the whole compatibility thing, xvid is probably what
you are going after. Certainly 2 pass. Quality is tons better - a bit more
work, but well worth it.

I'm not sure what resolution you are capturing at either. That info would be
helpful. Basically what I'm saying is that if you're capturing at a greater
resolution than what your output format supports

(i.e. svcd supports 480?480 @ 29.97 fps)
This site is pretty useful.

/svcd/faq/+svcd+resolution&hl=en&ie=UTF-8

4. Does anyone have experience with Moviex?  I found a website that
mentioned this -- it is MPlayer combined with a minimal Linux setup
that you can use to make a bootable CD-ROM for about 8MB.  (Then
again, people are less likely to bother watching the video if they
need to reboot.)
	Sorry, sounds cool though, more info?

5. If I stick with MPEG-1, is there a way to make a VCD with "extra
content" (the JPEGs and text files) so that someone can pop it into a
DVD player that understands VCDs, and see the video, but if they pop
it into a computer, they can access the other stuff?

See the above site. Nero has a plugin.

http://www.divx-digest.com/ has a ton of info, but more related to divx
encoding, a bunch of stuff for burning to dvd via mpeg 2 though, might be
helpful.
The www.dvdrhelp.com forums are sort of helpful.

Heh :)

Try 
  evolution --force-shutdown (or killev if 1.2.X)
  mv ~/evolution ~/old_evolution
  evolution 

There are some debugging ideas, but the above will determine if its an
evolution setting.

mv the directory back when you are done.

You can do the same for .gnome* .gconf* .gtk*

A little more precisely.

Someone subbed to PLUG has a "verify only" spam filter on his account.

The filter will not allow people who have not verified send mail.

PLUG mail has not verified since it is sent from people, or plug-admin.

So PLUG will never be verified.

Of course the question is why did someone set this up and not white list
his mail lists....  But this is what happens.

It does not work for a bunch of other reasons too, like why should I
jump through *your* hoops.

For a private email address that gets mail from few, known people, who
have the stronger desire to talk to you, than to tell you to f' off, it
works.

Good riddance.  Another challenge-response idiot caught by his own
hubris.

Most people just look at the verifications and go "but I just sent you
an email" or "Oh, god, another idiot that doesn't realise
using challenge-response makes you a willing part of the spam
problem."  I'm in the latter group:  It breaks reliable transmission
and actively prevents you from reporting spammers.  Seems like it
would be easier and just as effective to use the osirusoft RBL.

Yes, sadly, if you're encoding on a windows box and your choice is
between wmv and mpeg1, wmv is going to be a lot smaller. I don't know
why, but wmv seems to be a pretty good codec. Small wmv files usually
look pretty good.

Yes. It's questionably legal for linux users to use the wmv codec since
it's either using dlls that we don't have a license for or using reverse
engineered codecs that may be illegal under the DMCA. But, this hasn't
been tested in court and isn't likely to be, I don't think.

The best thing to do would be to go looking for more tools on that
machine and try to encode to divx, which is at least cross platform. The
gnuistically correct thing would be to try to find a way to encode to
Ogg Theora, but then any friend but a true techie will be screwed.

Most codecs have patent issues.

I watch wmv files on linux with mplayer or xine, and mac has a windows
media player available for it. I have had wmv files that worked fine in
windows crash mplayer, but I've also had wmv (and others) that worked
well in mplayer crash windows media player. So it's unclear who's the
winner.

blurp...okay. Or just give them Knoppix which comes with Xine if I'm not
mistaken...

No idea.

My final thoughts: if the wmv doesn't work on mplayer, mencoder can
sometimes (often) cross-encode it to lavc. I don't know why that is. But
the quality doesn't usually decline, or at least not badly.

Absolutely!  We're talking Microsoft here.  Just drop it, use Divx

I know osirusoft is currently listing 0.0.0.0/0.  That was my point.

So what it boils down to is misconfiguration on the part of the user. 

It's not that it "doesn't work"... It's that it has to be set up
correctly. Like every other piece of software on one's system.

Um. I disagree with this. Just as I should have control over who calls
my telephone number, I should have control over who can send me email.
If you REALLY want to contact someone, and they require you to verify,
then you'll verify. 

The opposite end of this arguement is "why should I be forced to deal
with your inbound email?"

You are correct in that you don't have to jump through hoops, but then
it's up to YOU as to how important it is to contact said person.

Subject: [PLUG] Messed up Evolution :(
Message-ID: <E19uCZb-0007rC-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

I ran Killev (because I'm running evolution 1.2.1), and moved the directory and
reran through my setup for evolution. But the menubar and toolbar are still
missing. Then I tried it over again with the gnome and gtk files. 

Thanks for your help, but it looks like I'm going to try reinstalling the rpms
and then perhaps a new mail client.

Email is called email because it equates better to the postal system.
Anybody can send you mail, that's the whole point.

However, I PAY FOR THE INBOUND BANDWIDTH, so I reserve the right to 
block those I feel need blocking.

Do you employ any spam limiting software? Even rules in your MUA? Then 
what's the difference?

With the USPS, the junk mail senders pay for the postage. There's no 
direct cost to me, beyond sorting through a few (less than 50 a month) 
unwanted advertisements.

With spam, I am currently receiving over 200 per day. I am very nearly 
at my limit and am comptemplating installing a challenge/response filter 
myself.

Here's an idea.. would you mind if I have my MTA forward all spam to 
you? By your own rules, you should happily accept it...

I didn't think so...

You're not making it a pain in the ass for the people you want to mail
you to do so.  That's the important part.  I *won't* subscribe to
someone else's inbox, end of story.  If they want my mail, they get to

You pay more to the garbage company to dispose of it than you do
bandwidth for email, yet you somehow find postal junk mail
defensable but legitimate email something to harrangue your
correspondents over.  Cute.  Sure got your priorities straight there.

Who said anything about you subscribing? I'll write a procmail rule to 
readdress it to you, and then it's your email.

You are the one who stated anyone should be able to send you email. I'm 
simply stating that is no longer a viable paradigm to operate under.

You didn't answer my question. Do you have any spam filtering rules in 
place? Do you use something like spamassassin, or something in your MUA 
to filter spam out of your email?

AND, it's not a pain in the ass to send ONE ADDITIONAL EMAIL to get 
added to the white list. Inconvienent... maybe. Hit reply and send. Two 
keystrokes/mouseclicks. Sounds pretty simple to me. You do this for 
nearly every mail list you subscribe to already.

But, if you can't be bothered to send ONE ADDITIONAL EMAIL, then I 
probably don't want your damned email anyway.

I filter my phone calls with caller id. If it says "Out of area" or 
"Unknown", then I left the answering machine get it. It's my line, and I 
can choose to accept or reject calls as I see fit. Email is exactly the 
same. USPS is the same too. When I sort out junk mail from my postal 
stream, I rarely open the mail that's obviously junk.

> If they want my mail, they get to operate in an open environment.

Maybe they don't want your email? Ever think of that? Either that, or 
it's just not important enough for you to contact that person. 
(Remember, that's ONE ADDITIONAL EMAIL.)

At this point, it's your call if it's important enough. They've already 
made a decision to require validation. That's their right, as they pay 
for the connection to the 'net.

Actually, no, I don't, recycling is free. I have to have garbage 
service, and the bins don't cost me extra. In fact, I can use a smaller 
waste can because I recycle. You sure thought out that one.

If I lived in Eugene, they DEDUCT from my garbage bill for recycling. 
Almost all junk mail is fully recyclable, and that's exactly where I put 
it.

If you are the only one using C/R then he only has to deal with one 
additional email but what if everybody he emails is using it? Also a lot 
of the C/R systems I've looked at have an option to wipe entries in the 
whitelist after a certain amount of time so that you'd have to reconfirm 
yourself.

Also, what do you think happens to the challenges when the spammer 
forges the From: address with a valid address belonging to an innocent 
bystander? All of a sudden they are getting challenge requests from 
people they have never heard from. Sounds abusive to me...

Finally, if enough people actually start using C/R the spammers will 
just alter their spamware to automatically respond to the challenges and 
you'll be in the same place you are now. Right now they are just using a 
forged From: address but all they have to do is open a Yahoo dropbox, 
send out their spam using that dropbox, reply to the challenge requests 
and be on their way to the next spam run.

I don't disagree that getting port-scanned is disagreeable ;)  I simply
don't think it should be a crime.  Criminalizing things because of what
"might" happen or what someone's intent "might" be is extremely
dangerous territory.

Then the sender makes a decision. Either it's worth it to contact that 
person, or it's not. If it's not worth it to reply to the challenge, 
then they hit delete, and off they go. No problem.

And that too is the choice the owner of the mailbox makes. I believe 
these systems also keep track of the time since last email, not just an 
arbitrary time since added to the database. For folks who correspond on 
a regular basis, it's no problem.

No more abusive than the hundreds of sobig.f mails I'm getting per day 
with forged headers, or the "failed clean attempts" I'm getting from NAV 
for mail gateways telling me my linux box tried to infect someone...

We deal with it, because the alternative is we are overrun with junk 
email. If I wasn't blocking mail, then my signal to noise ratio would be 
near 2:10. 2 legitimate emails for every 10 emails received. I kid you 
not. Fully 40% or better is rejected by postfix, and then 70% of what 
gets delivered to me is still junk. I had a personal best the other day 
of 77% of mail was rejected by postfix. That's BEFORE spamassassin got a 
hold of it. Spam sucks, and I'll do many things to reduce it to a 
managable level. That doesn't include a C/R system yet, but I'm close.. 
Real close.

That is called an arms race. We come up with a solution, and they come 
up with a way around it. We'll come up with something else, and 
eventually, they'll figure out a way to get around that too.

It happens. We will continue down that road. Even laws limiting spam 
would not stop this from happening.

I would argue if it is so easy to misconfigure, it is broken to begin
with.  The person who misconfigured theirs (who is probably bouncing all
his mail) was [likely] more intelligent than 95% of all the users.

No, not every piece of software has the potential for blocking main

I am a bit shocked no one has called you out on this.  This is just flat
out false.  You have extraordinarily little control over who calls your 
phone.  You only have two choices, refuse to answer the line (as you
mentioned in a later email using an answering machine), or follow a
punitive path (sue based on the do not call list).
 
> I should have control over who can send me email.

Think about that statement more.  It is really dumb.  This is a complete
failure to understand the design criteria of communications systems.

You might say "I should have control over which mails I read" which is a
HUGE difference (I give an example below).

Again you fail to understand communication design.  You are assume the
sender is the most active component in terms of desired communication. 
This is simply not true.  Its about 50/50 (sender/receiver) at best, and
more often than not the receiver wants the communication more than the
sender.  How can I make such a bold statement?  The receiver would not
be receiving messages (for any system) unless there was a desire for the
message.  If we did not like TV programs so much, we would not get
commercials.  We desire to watch more than the people who write the
shows desire to send.  When we detest the commercials so much (fairly
rare) we pay extra (HBO/Rental/Record and zap).

No, you have set up a bunch of false assumptions as I mentioned above. 
In this particular case, the sender(s) (the LIST) couldn't give a rat's
ass over the person receiving the mail.  Do not think that everyone who
emails you wants to desperately contact you.

Let's look at some simple examples:

A HOT GEEK GIRL, after just beating up Ed, sends you and email
expressing her agreement to meet you (you sent her a request).  Then
heads out.  Your email blocks her.  She goes out with Eric instead (hey
this is all made up).

You enter a contest at the local car dealership.  You give them your
email.  Later you win the prize.  They send an email, get a bounce, and
then pick the next name.

You email tech support for a company.  They reply with a no-response
email to you (common).  You never see the note.

You apply for a job.  An automated system sends a note that your resume
did not load properly, or you need to specify a field.  You never get
the note since the return address gets piled into a return box, or to
/dev/null.

Your friend writes a long email that you want to read and sends it from
a temporary account.  You never get the mail.

You bid on an auction item.  Ebay sends a note that you are now losing
and you must act in minutes to up your bid.  You never get the note.

--------

This are all real examples I can pull from recent emails (OK, like The
HOT GEEK GIRL would go out with Eric).

BTW I also picked things that may get filtered by SPAM filters as well.

The difference for spam filters and Challenge/Response seems to be
people expect SPAM filters to fail.  I would not mind Challenge/Response
that put un-authenticated messages into a bin and you whitelist as you
go.  But then why have Challenge/Response?  You have a spam filter with
a draconian whitelist filter.  The difference is *you* (the receiver) do
the hoop jumping, and now, you have complete control over *your main
INBOX.*

Another major difference is where does the mail sit when in limbo.  If
you have challenge/response and a MUA whitelist feature, how do they
work together.

The big difference is that you are accepting the call in full.  The
answering machine did not drop the call, you can still pick it up.

My brother does this, and it catches when I call him while I am roaming
on my cell phone, which then looks out of area.

> Actually, no, I don't, recycling is free. 

Umm, this is not related, but this is simply not true.  recycling may be
paid for by other means (trash fees, taxes, etc.).  But it is not
free.   Occasionally it breaks even or makes a profit somewhere down the
line, but it is not free for pickup costs, or processing costs.

Or if you truly believe that it is free,  I suppose, in your "send SPAM
to you vein" we could all send you our recycling, and then watch you
process it for free.

The difference is that the person infected with Sobig.f probably didn't 
put it on their computer on purpose. When you install a C/R system you 
do so knowing that it could be used to harrass third parties.

You are assuming this, so it's a spurious argument.

Now you are splitting hairs. I would argue that they haven't completed a 
phone call unless I picked up. If I don't pick up, they have attempted, 
nothing more.

If they hang up during the outbound message, then I count that as an 
incompleted phone call as well. My machine doesn't count it, since 
there's no message.

OK, I'll refrase. I should have control over who can DELIVER email to my 
system. They can try to send all they want. But I reserve the right to 
close the door and block them. In fact, I'm doing so, right now. Certain 
IP addresses are blocked from connecting on port 25 to my system.

Then the reciever will configure the software so the sender doesn't get 
a C/R.

In reality, what difference does all this make? Some folks will use C/R 
software. When they do, they have made a decision to block mail from 
unknown parties (similar to bouncing email from systems that don't 
reverse resolve). If you choose to not participate, then you BOTH lose.

This is more argument to install the software correctly, and to make 
sure you update it when you request mail from a source that can't 
respond to the C/R.

I'm not. I'm assuming that when YOU write an email directly to me, YOU 
desire to send information to me. If I've never communicating with you 
previously, I have no stake in the matter. So at this point, the ratio 
is 100:0.

If we've previously communicated, then the ratio is different. Depending 
on how much I want to receive mail from you, I may add you to my white 
list. If I don't want to receive from you, or don't care one way or the 
other, then I'd probably leave it alone until YOU initiate contact. 
Until that time, the receiver doesn't care.

And they are possible. No one said that managing this would start out easy.

These are also things that can be tuned.

I don't know, and that's a good question. Either the mail is delivered 
anyway, and the response simply flags future messages to not be 
processed, or the program holds it, pending a response.

Personally, I still have spam delivered to a special folder on my 
system, because I do get false positives. I would probably impliment the 
former, so I could verify "bad messages".

I figure if someone wants to talk to me without talking to my machine 
first, they'll let me know who they are during the ringing.

I haven't had an out of area call in the last month that didn't hang up 
before the machine spits out it's default message.

I don't even have a customized message. It's just, "Hello, please leave 
a message, after the beep.". Usually, they hang up after the word 
"message".

OK, here's the deal. I *HAVE* to have garbage service. The recycle bins 
do not cost any extra. SO, when it comes to MY WALLET, and how much I 
SPEND, it's free.

In fact, I can make an arguement that it SAVES ME MONEY, since I can use 
and pay less for a smaller garbage can because I recycle.

So, in reality, recycling isn't free. It pays me.

Ok, guys, let it rest. It's not an issue of understanding the "nature of
communications", it's an issue of personal approach to communicating.
People fall into two cathegories.
If I belong to the first type, when I get an unknown message, I think
"Hey, someone wants to talk to me, cool. Odds are they have something
interesting to say".
If I belong to the second type, then when I get an unexpected message I
think "What a bother. Odds are I don't want to talk to you anyway" (and
before someone asks why does such person even join the 'net, they do have
people they know and want to communicate with, they just don't want to get
to know anyone else).
Well, there is also the third type, wackos who believe that communicating
with them is the path to salvation for the rest of the world, but I'll
neglect that group for now.

Zot and Russ seem to belong to two different types, at least as far as
their electronic communication stype is concerned. Neither is wrong. Some
people go an extra mile to TALK to others, other do the same to AVOID
TALKING to others. When the opposing types meet, they don't understand why
in the world would the other guy choose to live the way he does,
conclude that it must be because he has't considered the alternative
(since it's obviously wrong to do things the other way, and nobody does
wrong willingly) and try to explain him the error of his ways.

BTW, if you missed the heavy dose of saracsm and exaggeration in the last
paragraph, the indignant comments you are about to send my way fall into
the cathegory of things I don't want to read.

I regret that problems on my system set off the wave of people calling
each other names, though it did raise some interesting points and exposed
some rather unexpected world-views.

As the contrite fire-starter, I'll refrain from direct retorts and just
report what happened.  I hope it has some educational value, or at least
gives some closure to those who became upset.

I've been using a procmail-based white-listing system for over a year,
since my spam-rate hit 4 per hour.  

I've been subscribed to this mailing list for a couple of years.

In just the 3 hours since I fixed my mail problem (described below), the
system blocked spam from 82 distinct 'from' addresses, i.e. 27 new
spammers per hour.  Ugh.

The whitelist system: Nic Wolff's 'procmail accept list' as posted at
http://angel.net/~nic/spam-x/


This system keeps 4 lists...  

 * An 'accept' list of OK senders (people who answered the 
   auto-generated message for previously unknown senders).

 * A 'deny' list of senders whose mail is to be quietly 
   discarded (manually updated, basically only effective 
   against non-pro spammers who actually use their real address)

 * An 'OK mailing lists' (manually updated, inside procmail script itself)

 * An 'OK domain' (manually updated, inside procmail script itself)


How it works normally works when email comes in:

 * The script determines the sender's email address by using 
   'formail' to create a reply header and extracting the 'To:'
   address that formail comes up with.

 * If the sender is on the 'deny' list, the mail is quietly
   discarded. Done.

 * If the subject line is 'Accept [sender's email address] for 
   [my email address]' then all prior email from this sender is
   delivered, the sender is added to the 'accept' list, and the
   challenge response itself, having served it's purpose, is
   discarded. Done.

 * If the sender's email is on the accept list, or is part of 
   an OK domain, or if the mail is addressed to an OK mailing list,
   then it is delivered to the user's inbox. Done.

 * If the mail hasn't been delt with by this point, then it 
   must be from a new address.  Check if any messages are 
   already cached from that address in a pending_messages 
   directory: if not, then send out the 'challenge' message.
   In any case, cache the current message.

The final part of the system is a cron job that deletes any cache files
more than 6 days old.


Here's why PLUG suddenly got a white-list challenge:

The rate and average size of spam email had increased so much that even a
6 day supply of spam was enough to fill up the entire /home partition...
Ouch.  

I'll be reviewing the 'spam' issue again and deciding if I need to tune my
rules or try a new system.  Suggestions on practical alternatives to the
challenge-response system would be appreciated.

I think we need to get away from filtering at the end user level. I 
don't mind doing challenge and response a couple of times. But I don't 
see it as a cure all.

I'd rather have a white list that is run collaboratively with a 
community I trust, like the PLUG. I mean, for the most part, if someone 
on this list is willing to put someone on an OK list I'm willing to 
accept that, at least provisionally.

Hi,

Is there a database system similar to MS Access on Linux? Or, better, 
something that runs on Linux and Windows?

Thanks

Holgar,

  Gag! Gak! NO! Access is a flat-file database. Very limited.

> Or, better, something that runs on Linux and Windows?

  Two that I can recommend: PostgreSQL and SQLite. The former is a standard
that approaches (or meets) the power of Oracle -- without the marketing hype
or cost. The latter is a SQL library that can be used for your own
applications, particularly embedded ones. Both GPL; both run on cygwin on
Microsoft. SQLite may have a native Winduhs port, but since I pay no
attention to such things I may be wrong.

OpenOffice.org can use ODBC backends and design forms and such like
Access.  I haven't any idea of how it compares, since I've never really
used Access and just got it set up enough to see that it worked.

PgAccess is something kinda like that for Postgresql.

Slightly lower-level, GNUe has Forms database components.

I've also heard that you can connect Access as a front-end through ODBC
to SQL servers, which will at least get your data out of a closed
format.

Subject: [PLUG] Video card with TV Out
Message-ID: <Sea2-F69nXg3A8c04gA0002bca4@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I am thinking about replacing my existing video card with a new one
that has TV out option so that I can broadcast some movies/videos
from my Linux box directly to my TV.  Most likely, I will be using Xine or 
RealPlayer on Linux.

My question is, what are some of the better video cards with TV out option
that has has good Linux support from the vendor?  I am not up with all the 
latest
happenings in the video card area.  The last time I bought a new video card, 
I bought
one made by Matrox which I am still using..  I am pretty happy with it.

Any input much appreciated.

Thanks

--Vincent

Mid-March?  Might be the thread where I was trying to figure out how to
nicely encode TV shows to fit two hours on a CD.  :-)

That sounds cool.  You can get some very high quality stuff when you go
to about 600MB/hour.

divx.

WMV... in my experience, it is easy to view in Linux, but it sucks in
the quality department.  If you're going for very small files (ie;
500KB/minute) it seems to be top-dog in the quality department.  If you
want medium sized files, it sucks compared to divx, et al.

Ok... is there a Linux alternative to grabbing the video?  Or if you can
deal with storing 60 minutes at 25Mb/sec (I assume you mean megabyte,
not bit)... that's about 67GB/hour... I *think* you can just 
cat file2.avi >> file1.avi then encode that with mencoder to a nice divx
format.

At super-low quality settings, WMV wins.  Otherwise, it loses.

As somebody else said, there are probably patent issues with *all* the
video formats... except that Ogg one he mentioned (and I haven't tried
yet).

mplayer is really pretty easy to get.  If they're in a binary distro,
they should find binary packages available... if not, it is a fairly
easy compile.  If they're in a source-based distro, they can get some
cool mplayer-ness... or build it their own, regardless.

Never heard of it...

I dunno... never played with VCD itself.  In my experience (a few years
old) VCDs are hard to play in computers... finding a reader in Linux was
a PITA.

If you decide you want to go the mencoder route, from Linux... I can
help you fine-tune some 2 pass encoding parameters for decent quality. 
I spent quite a bit of time fine-tuning my TV recording scripts to give
me the quality/size ratio I was looking for.

I use 2-pass divx encoding to encode TV shows... after they're encoded
and all done (with about 3 hours of CPU time put in for one hour of TV)
they're about 300MB an hour with about the same level of quality you'll
get out of an antenna and a VCR, I think.

Subject: [PLUG] Many CVS questions
Message-ID: <3F5555E7.30309@adnap.no-ip.com>

Hello.

I am in the process of configuring CVS on my server. I am not using CVS 
for any reason other than it's the only thing I had heard of in the open 
source area. Here are my requirements for the source control system:

1. It must have a simple interface. WinCVS works fine, but command line 
tools won't suffice (it will be used by other people that do not have 
(or want to have) any linux experience).

2. Users must be able to access it over the internet, and they must be 
able to access it *securely*. I want both the passwords and data 
exchanged over the network AND my system as a whole to be secure.  I'd 
like to give the users as little capability on the system as possible 
(i.e. no command line).

3. I must be able to install it on my RedHat 7.3 without disrupting too 
much existing stuff. The most important things are apache, sendmail, 
gnu-pop3d, and ssh (SFTP in particular).

I have set up CVS on my system, using SSH as the access protocol. If I 
stay with this setup, I will need some sort of shell to allow only CVS 
and SFTP access. I have been so far unsuccessful in finding such a program.

Assuming I stick with CVS, I have the following question:

How can I add a module to the list of modules? I can import modules just 
fine, and I can checkout a module if I know the name of it. But if I 
don't know the name of it, the command 'cvs checkout -c' produces no 
output and the only way I can get a list of modules is to look at the 
repository directory.

Thanks!
Evan

Thanks Wil and Rich!

I'll look into the stuff you suggested.

BTW, it is true that you can connect Access to a SQL back-end. Either 
through ODBC or ADO. The Access back-end is not far from being SQL 
conform and the export is pretty straight-forward. Not too much of a 
closed format there really.

It just so that you can develop little db aware business applications 
blazingly fast with Access. My business partner is on Windows and I am 
on Linux.

TkCVS works great on win and Linux, you need to install tk on the windows 
machines.  Should already have tk on Linux.

$ grep cvs /etc/services
you should see that cvspserver is setup on port 2401

cvs is very non-intrusive, it won't be a problem.  Just make sure you give 
the repository plenty of space.  /usr/local/cvs is a common location.

create a new group 'cvsusers' and set the default shell to /bin/false

TkCVS makes it much easier to work with modules.  Last time I used it you 
had to co CVSROOT and edit 'modules' to add an alias though.

Isn't the secret to rate mail based
on volume it is being sent out at so 
that it can be trapped at the ISP 
level if it exceeds what is likely 
legitimate?  

The other thing I'd like to see are 
ISP's catching worms and viruses.  
Without violating people's privacy, 
it should be possible to scan email 
data and other data for obvious 
viruses and worms at the 
intermediary routers affecting 
slowing certain types of attacks.

Probably the largest problem is that 
Winduhs does not protect software 
programs from Trojans and other 
malicious data.  I think the easy
hijacking of computers is the most 
integral part of the denial of service 
problem.

There has been some news that software
liability will become more important
after related court actions.  If it
means that Microsoft and others become
liable for selling any software that 
is easily cracked or has glaring 
security holes, that's probably 
a good thing.

An interesting history note is that
mail used to cost the receiver and
not the sender.  The latter is why
Thomas Jefferson wanted to receive 
less mail in his later years.

cvspserver is indeed listed in /etc/services. It is, however, not running.
Even if it was running, the lack of encryption of both passwords and 
data does not fit my needs.  I have heard of sserver, and I'm willing to 
try it if ssh falls through.

I'm not sure of the best way to deal with groups and /bin/false does not 
allow SFTP connections.  I already have rssh, which does the job just 
great but doesn't allow anything other than SFTP (including CVS).

I saw CVSROOT/modules, just wanted to make sure there was no cvs command 
to deal with modules. Thanks.

Hello everyone,

I am looking for a way to have everything I see on the screen sent to a 
file at the same time that it is displayed. In other words, I want to 
log all screen output to a file.

I was alerted to the possiblity of such functionality by a very old 
Tektronix document describing how to do it on their UNIX system:

Sends screen output to printer

1. Login to your account
2. Assign *filename* sys$output
3. Type out your commands
4. Deassign sys$output
5. Print *filename*

The assign and deassign commands were ass and deass and had something to 
do with tape drives.  They do not exist on my system.

If the above system worked, all I would need would be steps 1-4.

Thanks,
Evan

You should be able to tunnel through ssh--not my speciality, but this looks 
good,

and

An ssh tunnel should help here too.


Looks like lots of folks have done similiar things so it should be doable, 
google 'cvs tunneled ssh'

Hey,

This is just a plug for a very simple CVS utility called TortoiseCVS
(http://www.tortoisecvs.org/).  I have used it quite extensively both at
home and the office, and have found it to be the simplest way to work with
data in CVS.  If you are going to use CVS in an environment where the
simpler the better, give Tortoise a look.

For Linux I use the "gcvs" client which is a GTK+ interface written by 
the same group that does WinCVS. We use use WinCVS on Windows clients 
and either "gcvs" or command-line "cvs" on our Linux systems. "gcvs" 
isn't quite the same as WinCVS but it's similar enough. I mainly use 
"gcvs" for browing code snapshots on my system and then use emacs as my 
real CVS client when I'm actively cutting code and commiting changes to 
the repository.

As an Access developer (yes, I know, MS is evil, but Access what I've 
become good at, and it's catually a good product), I must beg to differ. 
 Access/JET is certainly a relational database, not a flat file database. 
 Access enforces relational integrity, supports transactions, rollbacks, 
etc.  What Access is not is a Database server, though it makes a perfectly 
good front-end for a database server.  Not only do I think Access is great, 
I was, for a while, heavily involved in an attempt to create a GPL, 
multi-platform replacement system.

The closest things to Access I have found in my wanderings appear to be 
Meargent (part of the GNOME office project) and pgSQL, though the latter 
works only with a PostgreSQL back-end.

Now, regarding whether a database server is superior to a client-based 
database engine with file shareing, there are cases where the file sharing 
system is superior.  Those are the cases where you need a database, but you 
don't need the hassle of installing a server or hiring a DBA.  You can copy 
your database file onto a CD, take it home, and open it up.  You don't have 
to create a backup, go home, log into your server as an administrator, 
create a database instance, decide where to put your log files, etc., then 
restore from the backup, ...

In that case what you want is the 'script' command.

You want to state your requirements a bit better.

MS Access is many things to many people.

It is a forms/UI/DB application thingy.  It can be used to make a pretty
darn good app to interact with a DB (any ODBC connection).  It is not
stateless like the web, so it can do some real interaction with the DB. 
It is quick and easy.  It ports fairly well to VB and Visual C.  It is
hard to beat for non-DB programmers for creating quick and dirty DB
thingies.  So this part has a few parts:  Forms, Reports, DB Setup

It is also a database itself.  Anyone with DB experience will tell you
how crappy it is, but that is how people use it.

So if you need a DB, use *Anything* else.

If you need a portable DB UI thingie you have a few choices:

1)  Web based.  PHP/Perl/ASP/Cold Fusion will handle most DB real well. 
There are a number of script based interfaces that do the DB setup
(pgAdmin, myAdmin, etc.).

2)  runtime app based.  pgAcess is not bad.  I have not done forms with
it though.

3) Programmed.  There are a ton of environments that you can make killer
apps that work on many OSes.  [Perl|Tcl]/TK , Python, and Kylix are two
I have seen.

4)  Office Suite Based.  Open Office is supposed to do this.  I have not
tried.  I think there are Koffice tools.  There are several that fit
here or in #2.

So decide what you want and what you need.  If web based, pick a Linux
server drop Apache, PHP and Postgres, and phpPgAdmin on the server and
design away.

The others will require people to answer with more experience.

Well, I'm thinking this is kind of off-topic, but I didn't
get an answer on the "talk" list. I was hoping to entice
someone who is familiar with some of the packages (e.g.. Ardour,
Rosegarden) to come over and poke around on my system for
a half hour to see if things are basically working, or if
my sound card or something is just busted.) - I could offer
a couple of beers at the Barley Mill as an inducement
(Hawthorne & 17th.)

If things are basically working, then I'm happy to spend
the learning time to figure out how to use things. But I
have the feeling that something is just screwed on my
system.

-Mike

And if all 50,000 subscribers of bugtraq decide to install C/R systems?
That's 50,000 deletes or replies to do. I really wouldn't want to handle
just the 400 or so responses from the subscribers of PLUG.

At least with byugtraq, if you forward to the list admins the automatic
response a subscriber sent to your post, be it a challenge as part of a
C/R, an out-of-office notification, or an anti-virus program deciding a
gpg signature is really a virus, they'll unsub the offender. Even with
that policy, you can expect about 30 automatic responses to each bugtraq
post, if you gpg sign your message.

As usual, someon ehas written a "Considered Harmful" document about C/R
systems, in response to a debian-user thread:

All,

I would like to have my machines auto-update by running a weekly crontab
like so:

  emerge rsync
  emerge update portage
  emerge -u world

May one rely on this not breaking things?


Best,

I'm saying that paradigm is what keeps email a functional, useful form
of correspondence.  The rest of this is pretty irrellevant.  Go hit
the debian-user archives and look for Allan Connor's thread about
challenge response systems (it's a big one).  Summary: C-R considered
harmful to it's own users, annoying to everyone else.

Meaning then C/R is basically a pissing contest that wastes even more
bandwidth and still does nothing to actually combat the problem.
Report your spam.  After a while, your spam volume goes *way* down.
Using spamassassin to sort my spam off someplace handy until I report
it, I'm averaging 0.0098% spam since I started keeping archives of
everything back in March (~54,000 ham, 528 spam, I went through my
archive last weekend after I accidentally toasted ~/.spamassassin and
retrained it).

I was there once.  Make yourself a hostile target and report
spammers.  I got my users to report spam themselves (and if they're
lazy, forwarding me their spam), my site is a pretty hostile target.
Spammers learn, though slowly.

My card isn't NEW, exactly, but I like it heaps and it does a stellar job
of TVOut.

It's a Matrox G400 DualHead card with a TVOut dongle.

The only annoying thing is that there is no Back End Scaler on the second
head, so you can't just say "mplayer -fs" on the second head and get
scaled video full-screen without other performance hits.

Oh, yeah, I use mplayer for TVOut.

I agree. When it comes to development, Access is a very simple program
to use to store and retrieve data.  As I learn more about Linux/Unix
development, I hope to come across something that will equal Access's
functionality.

I've mostly been ignoring spam, because usually the source is not
obvious. Your post has intriqued me.  Is there a writeup somewhere on
how to go about reporting spam?

You know, I vaguely remember there being a law against sending spam in
Oregon or Washington, not sure which, but I thought it was Oregon, and
there being stories of people successfully getting checks for $300-$500
out of spamming companies by sending them letters threatening to sue in
small claims court. Anyone know anything about this? I have the time, i
could go after spammers...

Though it's rare, it sometimes needs a personal touch if something 
breaks during updates.  As long as you read your output to keep your 
config files updated, it should work.

Myself I just run

emerge sync
emerge -pu world

Then decide when I want to update.  Sometimes I'll just update a few 
parts for now and update the rest later.

It's Washington. I tried this once. The spammer claimed
that I had subscribed to a mailing list, which I didn't.
It was clear that he would fight me by claiming that I
had agreed to receive his spam but forgot. I didn't have
the time for this, so I blocked all his IP addresses and
the IP addresses of his uncooperative ISP.

Perhaps script(1) would work for you? By default it writes *all* output
- STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, escape sequences; everything - to a file called
'typescript'. Ex:

sandbox: ~ $ script
Script started, file is typescript
sh-2.05a$ touch foo
sh-2.05a$ ls foo
foo
sh-2.05a$ exit
exit
Script done, file is typescript
sandbox: ~ $ cat typescript
Script started on Wed Sep 03 08:44:04 2003
sh-2.05a$ touch foo
sh-2.05a$ ls foo
foo
sh-2.05a$ exit
exit
 
script done on Wed Sep 03 08:44:33 2003

Lest everyone here think that Tektronix UNIX (UTek) was totally

Once you get CVS up and running, you might want to install cvsweb.  It
provides a nice web interface for browsing the repository.

PMVision can be a bear to run.  First of all, it requires a JDK 1.1,
which is kinda old, but can be installed alongside other versions fairly
easily.  Here's what my script to start it looks like; it's a slightly
modified version of the script that shipped with it:

====
#!/bin/sh
 
unset CLASSPATH
JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jre117_v3
PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
 
#CLASSPATH=/usr/local/jre117_v3/lib/rt.jar:.
if [ -s ../helpsys.jar ]
then
        help_loc=../helpsys.jar
else
        help_loc=./helpsys.jar
fi
if [ -s ../oromatcher.jar ]
then
        oro_loc=../oromatcher.jar
else
        oro_loc=./oromatcher.jar
fi
 
jre -cp pmvision.jar -cp pmvhelp.jar -cp $help_loc -cp $oro_loc PMVision $*
====

And yeah, sometimes they can be difficult to get running.  I had
FilterEditor running once (which is a good deal easier to use than the
editor built into PMVision), but now it won't connect at all.

I've also used this in an environment where WinCVS was deemed to be too
complicated and it worked well.  Getting it set up over SSH was the
hardest part, and if you don't care about security or strong
authentication that step can be skipped.

I was thinking about doing the first line of that in a nightly
crontab...  but nothing quite so severe as emerge -u world in it.  But
then, I have several ~x86 packages here.

In all honesty, I really would expect it to break things.  If not at
first, eventually.  I *always* look to see what emerge -u world is going
to do (and actually use -U world) with an emerge -Up world first.

You may well be able to get along without it breaking anything... but I
sure wouldn't want to trust it like that.....

My partner is after a simple data storage and retrieval tool that
supports easy report creation. He knows Access which does a pretty good
job with it. We plan a company with outsourced manufacturing and need a
flexible tool to handle the materials and parts. This is Portland: of
course, no budget to buy. 

We've resorted to spread sheets for now until I find a replacement for
Access. Or give in and add it to the things I have to run in VMWare. 

Thanks to all who gave suggestions!

Can sftp be disabled be disabled by removing a line from sshd.config?
I believe the line is subsystem=/usr/include/sftp-server.

If I'm not mistaken, there's a way with CVS to indicate who can
commit and who can just read the archive.

How do you tell the difference between a fake received line verses a
real one?  It says that you need to look for a progression or something,
but I'm not following.  An email is sent to someone, what can be faked
in the headers and what can't be?

Subject: [PLUG] Massive buffer cache yet still swapping
Message-ID: <5095-54250@sneakemail.com>

I've recently run into a performance problem on my desktop where the
system swaps out things that I'd rather stay in memory (i.e. the Mozilla
session I was using 10 minutes ago, desktops I haven't visited for a
while, etc.)  All the while, I see a massive buffer cache taking up space
that could be used for the programs I'm about to use again.

A search of the Usual Spots (google) hasn't turned up much:

http://www.google.com/search?q=linux+buffer+cache+limits

This guy seems to have the same problem I do:
  + http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-mm/2001-04/msg00010.html

but I never saw any solution posted.

Even in 1999 it looked like the documented /proc/sys/vm values didn't
work:
  + http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-mm-www/1999-12/msg00000.html

Here's what /proc/meminfo shows me:

The problem is the Cached: line seems very high.  The next step is some

A lot of times the only line you can trust completely is the top line 
where your server received a message from another machine. The Received: 
headers start from the bottom up and a lot of times will be forged or 
from an open relay or open proxy. When I report spammers I always report 
the machine that connected to my mail server, the ISP of the website 
advertised in the spam and any dropboxes in the spam that the spammer is 
using to collect replies.

Lately spammers have been heavily abusing open proxies from China and 
Korea so reporting the origin of the mail is pretty useless. The best 
way to hurt a spammer where it'll do the most damage is to get his 
website and/or dropboxes shut down so that he can't actually profit from 
his spam run.

You can also try running the spam through spamcop.net to trace headers 
but their parsing isn't always that great so if you just concentrate on 
tracking down who is hosting the spammer's website and dropbox you will

Yes.

Unfortunately, the CVS pserver method is not encrypted, so it's generally
pretty simple to grab someone's password and impersonate them.

On our CVS system we use SSH and public key authentication with the
command that the key can run limited to "cvs server".  We use file
permissions to manage access.

The CygWin SSH client is pretty easy to install, but was definately the
hardest part of the Tortoise setup.

  Spammers almost always spoof the "From: " line, the "Reply-to: " line and
the domain name. However, the IP address is valid. Consider the header of
this message:

  Working from the bottom up, we see the IP address 127.0.0.1 which we know
is the localhost, then we see 209.210.202.170 and, at the top,
198.107.38.238. The latter traces to verio.net and the former to:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ whois 209.210.202.170 at whois.arin.net
[whois.arin.net]
Electric Lightwave Inc ELI-NETBLK98 (NET-209-210-0-0-1)

  So, if this was spam, I'd report it to both abuse at verio.net and
abuse at eli.net and let them determine just which customer is abusing their
acceptable use policies.

Wil, Rich.  You both came up with the same answer.  I installed the latest 
and greatest JRE (1.4?).  Next I'll try recompiling PMVision (I think I 
saw the source tarball) and if that doesn't come easy I'll install the 
older version of the JRE.


Thanks for the clue,

  ... and Japan, and Taiwan, and Malaysia and so on and so forth. That's why
many of us have extensive lists of IP addresses that are open relays or
otherwise tolerant of spammers. Unfortunately, we all pay for the bandwidth
and server capacity the spammers use to ship out their stuff and we use
rejecting it.

Subject: [PLUG] Protecting bandwidth...
Message-ID: <1062616728.14143.51.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

What would it take to avoid the bandwidth losses from spam?
Do the ISPs have to stop it?

Is email going to have to be graded by ISP's at some point
based on a spam scale, 1 being definitely spam whereas 10
would definitely not be spam?  How could such a system be
implemented without creating zero privacy or large scale
false positives?

I'm thinking a lot of these worms that generate tons of 
messages  and send them at volumes intended to crash
systems should be easy to catch, unless the spam stream
looks like valid email or contains valid messages.

What percentage of email is spam and what is it's
average affect on bandwidth in our area?

Another question is, how can sendmail be programmed
to deal with overload gracefully?  I figure the most 
affective policy is to go offline and let all the 
senders bounce to reduce the volume.  Trouble is, 
will you get hit by as many retries when you come 
back?  The less extreme answer is to go to a list 
of allowed senders that shortens based on their 
level of importance and increasing overload up 
to thrashing.  This latter policy could be 
abandoned when the load is lighter.  What level 
of saturation should it be triggered at and how 
can such an approach be implemented with sendmail?  
Essentially, I'm thinking sendmail should close off 
mail service in cases of thrashing.  I've never 
overloaded to my knowledge, but I do wonder about 
this issue.

Should a primary server not accept retransmitted
email?  If you have a backup I would guess anything
being retransmitted should be dealt with by it.
Which brings up another question, how can I implement
a filter that checks if a message matches contents
wise exactly to one I've received already?  If
someone tries to send the same message multiple
times, it'd be nice to have that filtered out.

Clearly challenge response won't work because spammers
will just program their generators to respond and it's
the wrong answer for mailing lists like this one.  How
long will E-Bay's type in this box what these symbols
are work?

Privacy in email is a red herring. As an unencrypted form of 
communication, it's right up there with ftp and telnet.

If you want privacy, write a letter, and hand deliver it.

I don't know any easy way off the top of my head, but you could probably
write a macro to do it in StarBASIC or Java.  You might search for one
already written; it wouldn't surprise me.

Actually, it's easier than that.  Go to File->AutoPilot->Document

For a system like that to work I would think that you would have to 
first accept the mail, proccess it to determine the scale and then 
decided what to do with it. By then the spammer has already used your 
bandwidth and you've used your resources to process the message.

Postini has a cool thing on their webpage if you have a shockwave 
capable browser that shows current spam statistics. For the last several 
weeks it's been hovering in the 70% range meaning that for the 84 
million inboxes they protect 70% of the mail has been identified as 
spam. AOL has released statistics that say they are reject over 50% of 
all incoming email and their users are still screaming about the number 
of spam in their inboxes.

I think this is sort of what Vipul's razor, pyzor and the DCC all do. 
People submit their spams to these systems and then you can check 
incoming mail against their database.

There is a new system of "greylisting" that some people are playing 
around with where any email attempts from non white-listed people are 
given a 4xx error. If the message is being sent from a real, dedicated 
mail server the mail will be retransmited again and accepted by the 
receiving server. Since a lot of spammers are using direct-to-mx 
spamware that just sends everything once and shuts down their messages 
aren't making it through these greylisting systems. In that situation 
the message must be retransmited more than once.

I don't even mess with Cygwin's ssh environment.  Instead, get Pageant,

Unfortunately, the CVS pserver method is not encrypted, so it's generally
pretty simple to grab someone's password and impersonate them.

On our CVS system we use SSH and public key authentication with the
command that the key can run limited to "cvs server".  We use file
permissions to manage access.

The CygWin SSH client is pretty easy to install, but was definately the
hardest part of the Tortoise setup.

This is on a RedHat kernel 2.4.20-20.7, but the problem does not seem to
be RedHat or 2.4 sub-version specific.

Interestingly, the kernel source documentation reads:

----- /usr/src/linux-2.4.20-20.7/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt -----
buffermem:

The three values in this file correspond to the values in
the struct buffer_mem. It controls how much memory should
be used for buffer memory. The percentage is calculated
as a percentage of total system memory.

The values are:
min_percent	-- this is the minimum percentage of memory
		   that should be spent on buffer memory
borrow_percent  -- UNUSED
max_percent     -- UNUSED
-----

I was unable to locate the struct buffer_mem in the kernel source.  My
guess is that this capability was either never implemented or was removed
without updating the documentation.  (Gee, I never do that...  ;-)

Thanks everyone for all your info! I have read all of it and I'm still 
working things out.  I will be sure to let the list know what I finally 
decide on.

I have had no end of grief dealing with putty and private keys.  I think 
this is partly because I don't understand how the private key thing 
works and partly because the formats for the keys is different between 
OpenSSH and putty.

I am currently using an adaptation of OpenSSH for windows:

http://lexa.mckenna.edu/sshwindows/

It is working very well for me.

How exactly does one limit the access to just one command?

Not exactly, but you can use OpenOffice, ODBC, and a database such as
MySQL to achieve similar results:

I've never been able to use Putty as an ssh tunnel.  It makes a fine
terminal with SSH capabilities, but for CVS over SSH you'll need something
else.  I've had good luck with the *recent* Cygwin SSH.  Some of the older
versions were terrible to get working.

The first step would be "man sshd".  ;-)

(http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd)

In the section "AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT":

----- 
command="command"

Specifies that the command is executed whenever this key is used for
authentication.  The command supplied by the user (if any) is ignored.  
The command is run on a pty if the client requests a pty; otherwise it is
run without a tty.  If an 8-bit clean channel is required, one must not
request a pty or should specify nopty. A quote may be included in the
command by quoting it with a backslash.  This option might be useful to
restrict certain public keys to perform just a specific operation.  An
example might be a key that permits remote backups but nothing else.  
Note that the client may specify TCP/IP and/or X11 forwarding unless they
are explicitly prohibited.  Note that this option applies to shell,
command or subsystem execution.
-----

An example from my configuration:

----- authorized_keys (all one line)  -----
no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,
command="/usr/local/bin/cvs server" ssh-dss <big-ass string O'characters>
<user>@<host>

Odd: vm.txt ("dated" 2.4.19) seems fairly out of date, unless Red

I think it's the former since some of the articles I ran across while
Googling were for Debian or Mandrake in addition to RedHat.

There are other projects for Gnome and KDe that allow you to create 
forms for PostgreSQL/MySQL/etc databases...just like you can in Access.  
Don't recall the names at the moment, but I was trying the kde one 
recently. Seemed pretty decent for general usage.

Privacy?  Email is as private as a postcard.  Avoiding false positives?
That's the very soul of the art of spam filtering.

I'm glad you're curious about this stuff, and you're obviously putting a
lot of thought into it.  It's the sort of thing system administrators
think about and research and discuss, and they've been doing it for a
while.  A bit of Googling and reading will sate your curiosity far better
than anyone here can.

I put together a little document that details how to make ssh tunnels with
putty.  The document is available here:

Nice document-- I particularly like all the screenshots showing each step,
though I would have avoided using javascript to open them in new windows.

Now, how would you do it from the command line, which is a necessity for
something like WinCVS or Tortoise to work?  ;-)

Well, that I don't know how to do.  However, I bet if you read this page
it would tell you how to do it:
http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.53b/htmldoc/Chapter7.html.  Now I
have something else to add to my document.  Thanks for the idea.

The smallest MS Access equivalent I'm aware of is this shell script:


#!/bin/bash

while true; do
    dd if=/dev/random of=yourdata.mdb bs=1024k count=100
    echo "Your database seems corrupt. Try running Repair on it."
done


Sorry, couldn't resist ;)

I found an excellent thread on this problem on the linux kernel mailing
list.  It took some time to find the correct search terms.

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=106126815206709&w=2

(BTW, the magic search term was "cache maximum".  Leaving off
"buffer" turned out to be a big help.)

The consensus seemed to be that for large memory systems running 2.4
kernels, that "swapoff -a" was the best way to eliminate the problem.  A
bit drastic, perhaps, but I bet it's quite effective.

The 2.6 kernels are reportedly a bit more effective at not swapping out
user programs to make room for file cache.

If you scan email for spam at an ISP of other ISP's you save bandwidth
from that ISP to the target(s).  I'm figuring the messages have to clear
text for an ISP to scan them, hence the privacy questions.  The only
obvoius magic bullet I can think of is to throw anything out that has
any forged address in it.  The sooner an email is discarded on route
to a destination, the more bandwidth there is, hence where scanning it
can be part of saving bandwidth even though that means it has been

  Unfortunately, the VM system has been changing a lot recently.  The
/proc/meminfo file hasn't been very well documented since around 2.2.x.

  I was fighting with memory leaks in a kernel module last year and wrote
this little script.  It reads /proc/meminfo and stores the data in a daily
CSV file.  Run the script from cron every X minutes, depending on the
resolution you want to see.  

  Then, It's a simple matter to load the CSV into your spreadsheet of choice
and make charts from the data.  I found the trend data much more useful than
random numbers in a file.  

  The linux kernel will normally use all the memory available.  It will only
savage free cache memory as needed.  The VM shouldn't start swapping until
it runs out of free cache.  The Buffers and Cache are two different memory
pools.  If you're going into depletion because Buffer memory is depleting
real storage... then you have a kernel problem.  Buffer memory is all kernel
space.

  I have some very cool charts I can show you that have that exact same
condition. ;-)  I had a leaky kernel module blowing up memory every few
days.  First comes depletion, then comes swap, then comes thrash, then comes
crash!  The developer and I pulled our hair out for a month finding (and
fixing) all the leaks.

Even if you don't break something (which you eventually will), portage 
won't restart your daemons for you, which means you could end up running 
an exploitable daemon months after the patch was released. ;)

you could store them as large blobs (they should be binary because XML's
whole unicode thing)

this would be a slow database unless you are using good indices, you
could also store them on disk and have mysql point to the file
location...

problems:

1) how do you define a forged header? I have email accounts that do not
have SMTP servers, and I send email from those addresses using other
SMTP servers...is that a forged header? A computer is likely going to
think so.

2) if you discard the email, you are violating the rule of
non-interference which is critical because false positives mean that
email becomes an untrustworthy medium (not untrustworthy in that it's
insecure, cause we know it is, but untrustworthy in that you cannot
trust an email will be delivered. Right now you mostly can.) Or do you
send back a response to the originator? Cause that cancels out the
bandwidth savings.

Yet if you log and block the email and let the administrator look at it,
you create metric tons more work for the administrator.

The only thing I can see working for this idea relies on large hard
drive space and ignores privacy: store copies of email for 3 hours as
they go through. If you see more than 5 duplicates of an email, start
dropping it, because it's clearly spam. But then, the spammers will just
write code which puts some random text into their spam.

So I'm not sure you can win with this one. At least not with the way
you're thinking.

But how do you detect forged addresses?

ISPs can certainly make that determination in their
egress filtering but they don't. Once it goes beyond
the originator's ISP, there's no easy way to know.

I think you'll find that a _lot_ of things have changed between 1.1
and 1.4.. some of which are not easily fixed. (The new focus model
comes to mind, but event handling changed drastically arround 1.1 time
also--this however may still be supported).

Good luck,

Dirk,

  Have you tried piping the output of lsof through grep? I do this all the
time to find a stuck soffice.bin. In that case, the syntax is 'ps ax | grep
soffice.bin'. Use the same approach with lsof.

If you type "mount" does it show the partition as writable?
Did you umount the camera after you removed those pictures?

Is the potential collateral damage from such a brittle scheme worth the
trivial amount of bandwidth saved?  I'd guess that for a typical ISP
their pr0n consumption exceeds the amount of bandwidth that spam
consumes by at least one order of magnitude.

Julian Haight has automated the process at spamcop.net, and if you
turn on the "technical details," it will tell you how to go about
doing it.

Hope this helps.

This seems to be a perennial fantasy among OSS fans: that some GPL'ed
code is discovered in someone's code (oh, let it be Microsoft, please!),
and they are thus forced to open-source ALL of their code.

But all the GPL says is what the conditions for COMPLIANCE are.  So if,
say, MS were discovered with GPL code in Windows, the GPL would
effectively say: IF you want to keep this in Windows, THEN you must
release the rest of Windows (or at least the connected part) under the
GPL.

If it ever came to a courtroom, a sympathetic judge might rule that they
are out of compliance with the GPL.  But that wouldn't automatically
lead to a ruling to GPL everything else.  Most likely, the judge would
simply rule that they had to remove the GPL code.  If we were lucky, the
judge might award monetary damages. especially if it could be shown that
it was a deliberate violation, as opposed to, say, Sun getting it from
SCO.

I've heard a couple of recommendations for divx.  How does it compare
to MPEG-1?

I figure if I use VCD or SVCD, then it can always be viewed in a
standard DVD player (in most cases) and wouldn't require a computer.
Also, can divx be viewed under Windows (without, say, expecting the
Windows (l)users among the recipients to go download some tool?

What sort of compression rate could I expect with divx, and how would
it compare to MPEG-{1,2,4}?

No -- standard convention is b=bit, B=byte.

Never a problem for me.  When I did "apt-get install xine" the first
thing I ran it on was my wife's VCDs.  (They're popular in Asia for
recording TV series.  For TV source, you only really notice the low
frame rate when they have, like, a sword fight.)  VCDs always worked
-- DVDs were harder because of having to install the decss stuff
manually.

It sounds like divx does a much better job than MPEG-1, though
"antenna" kind of makes me worry (from my experience living in
Cambridge, Mass., which was about the last place in the US to get
cable because of endless negotiations with the cable company
wannabes).

Washington.  IANAL, but if you have a printer directly connected to
your machine, you might successfully be able to argue that they
violated fax anti-spam laws from the 1980s, since the laws describe a
fax machine as anything "capable of transcribing to paper."

This might be easier to argue if you use a keyboard and line printer for
your console (linux does actually support this).

First off, like most of the HOWTOs I've seen on tldp, I assume Debian
because it's what I use[1].  If this doesn't match up with your RPM based
distro, that's a personal problem, switch to Xandros, Knoppix
installed to a hard drive, Debian, or another similarly sane distro.
8:o)

Here's what I have done to get my site down to ~0.009% spam.  All
packages are in sid, so if you're using woody, don't be stupid, use
backports and DO NOT USE APT-PINNING.  If you need to know why, google
for apt pin harmful site:lists.debian.org.

Get exim-daemon-heavy and sa-exim (it'll pull in the necissary
depends, like spamassassin).  Out of the box, you'll have an automatic
teergrube (anything that scores higher than 30 gets teergubed instead
of delivered, watch the headers sa-exim puts in
/var/log/exim4/reject.log to make sure this is a sane number, though
the default is high enough that I've yet to see any ham get nailed by
it).

Then, go dig around through
/etc/exim4/conf.d/acl/30_exim4-config_check_rcpt and add this to the
(empty) blacklist section.  Please note: When you use RBLs, please do
the RBL maintainers a *huge* favor by *not* mentioning them in your
reject messages (do not use the defaults).  It only appears to serve
to confuse users and anger some, the angry ones then turn around and
harass the RBL maintainers for blocking their email, something that
the maintainers had zero to do with.  Also, spammers that use
dropboxes in their From: will get the bounces, see who is giving them
the most grief, and DDOS them (witness osirusoft).

This combinations of RBLs turns up about one false positive every four

I'm not sure Ogg Theora (the video half of the Ogg multimedia codec)
is ready yet, I know I haven't seen it.  I've seen some semi-Ogg,
semi-DivX movies, using DivX for the video and Ogg for the audio;
these files usually end with .ogm.

Access hardly counts as a database in reality, there's not anything
really equivilent to Access in Linux.

Just move up to some form of SQL.  apt-cache search sql to find
available packages (debian based distros only, you're on your own in
RPM land).

Until you discover that the file-sharing system doesn't handle
simultaneous transactions cleanly and it's a great way to corrupt data
over time.  Database servers are easier to set up, too, so it's best
just do it the Right Way.

Easy.  Messages start with a score of zero (neutral) and go above (is
spam) or below (isn't spam) points based on content.  User adjusts
thresholds to a score that is sane for the conditions they're in.
This is spamassassin's default behaviour.  Use exim4 with sa-exim and
*bam*, spammers past a score of 30 (you very, very rarely see ham with
a score higher than 4, so nothing actually not spam gets scored that
high) get teergrubed for 5 minutes (locking up a socket for them, thus
slowing them down, thus less spam sent to the rest of the world), and
rejects the spam.

Vastly depends person to person, not region to region.  Some people do
things to invite spammers (like post their site on FFA pages, or use
AOL, etc.  Up until a couple years ago, Yahoo reserved the right to
sell your email address to whoever they damn well pleased, and did;
having a valid email address has always been a condition of membership
there, too).

That would mean anybody using their ISP's mail server wouldn't be able
to mail you.

eBay got the idea from Yahoo, which as been doing it since I was in
middle school.  I'm now 21.

I'll second this.  This is an excellent, excellent site for someome just
getting started with digital video.  I particularly like all the info they
have on VCD/SVCD/miniDVD for those of us who are too cheap to buy a DVD-R
burner and prefer to use cheap CD-R media.  (But still want the discs to
play in our DVD players...)

I've just started playing with dvd::rip, a perl-based DVD rip-and-convert
suite for linux.  The best way to try this out is to get "apt" from
http://www.freshrpms.net, install it, and then use apt to download
"perl-Video-DVDRip" from the same site.  The dependencies are a nightmare,
even with apt.

I've used dvd::rip in conjunction with "ffmpeg" (one of the dependencies)
to produce some very high quality MPEG-4 Divx-compatible video.  (I've had
some problems getting the "burn" portion of dvd::rip working, but I can
manually burn the images it creates without any problems.)

In the Windows world, I've found a combination of DVD2AVI, TMPGEnc, and
VCDEasy to work well.  This quick guide shows how:

http://www.dvdrhelp.com/mpeg2tovcd.htm

The quality with these tools seems somewhat lower than with ffmpeg.  Also,
VCDEasy recently went to nagware from freeware, so look for the pure
freeware version (http://www.google.com/search?q=vcdeasy+1.1.5.2).

If you already know the file you want to check, just:

lsof <filename>

You could also use:

fuser -u <filename>

(I think this works on Linux, but don't have a box handy to check with.)

One of the most common uses I have for lsof is to see what process is
listening on a given TCP port:

lsof -i tcp:80

Shows all processes that have TCP port 80 open.

Well, MS bashing is fun, but Access has managed to pretty much wipe DBase, 
Paradox, et al. right off the map for a reason.  It works pretty well. 
 Also, JET is the file-based database.  Access is a database front-end that 
includes JET if that's what you want to use.  And for all the disadvantages 
of a file-based system, it has plenty of advantages.
Some databases need relational and weak ACID capabilities, but they are 
used more in the context of documents than in the context of repositories. 
 You want to be able to make copies and open them on the fly like 
documents, etc.  If server daemons are such a great idea, why doesn't 
Gnumeric install a spreadsheet server?  Regarding the file corruption 
issue, most Access database corruption (in the back-end data files) arises 
from faulty NICs on an unswitched LAN and rarely occurs on a 
well-maintained LAN.  I've supported systems in production for years that 
demonstrate this.
I'm not saying Access is perfect - I bitch about it every day, and 
Microsoft's new licensing, only a Mother could love.  Every time I look for 
something else with the advantages Access has for my clients, though, I 
don't find it.  I'm hoping Meargent or Open Office reaches a point where it 
can work as a viable replacement soon, but as yet, they're not there.

I'd consider it more of a tool for creating simple frontends to real
databases.  "Simple" being the operative word.

Unless you use apt from freshrpms.net ;)  Works great.

Access *is* good at several things, mapping relations and creating
simple interfaces being a couple of them (although I find some of the
graphical tools more cumbersome than cli tools, that's probably just
me).

Ugh.  Strongly disagree.  I've corrupted enough Access databases trying
to have two or three users access them simultaneously that I can assure
you that file-sharing is a horrific approach.  If you need more than a
single user system, use a database server.

Certainly simplicity is one of Access' strong points.  As long as you
don't try to use it as a replacement for a server, I'd have to concede
that it is fine (although having to install 150MB worth of software to
access a 15K database seems rather odd to me).   However, there is one
thing to consider (and this is true of any software tool):  if what
you've developed (be it with Access or anything else) is actually
useful, others will want to use it as well.  Of course, to avoid data
replication, you'll want to share the database, rather than give each
person their own copy.  Next thing you know you've got a real
maintenance problem because you've taken Access out of its niche.  From
my experience, if you're taking the time to develop a program, no matter
how seemingly trivial, you should always be prepared to have that
program become part of a larger system, as this seems to be the rule
rather than the exception.  Sometimes this leads to over-engineering a
simple program, but more often than not, it saves you from having to
start from scratch.

That ignores reality.

I'm on a contract to analyze my client's ERP system and look for
replacements. They have a bunch of supplementary Access databases they
use for reporting and data mining. Just two users on it to dig up the
data for others. Works like a charm and costs next to nothing. Should I
tell them to scrap it because Access doesn't count in db reality? 

Or my own situation: my partner can create the Access reports for our
material lists in matter of hours. With any other system I know it takes
days or weeks.

There are a lot of database situations with less than 5 users. And there
are and thousands of Access applications out there that help
coordinating the economy. Years ago I built an ERP/sales tool with
Access and sold it to companies with 2~15 users. I moved away and on,
don't support it any more but they still use it as the main tool for
bidding, ordering and invoicing, warehouse management and stuff. 

If we want to compete against an established monopoly it doesn't help to
ignore its strengths. 

Holger

PS Access does talk SQL. Not too far from ANSI either.

Some newer DVD players support divx files, now.  As for viewing under
Windows... virtually all AVI files out there these days seem to be
encoded with DivX or as .mov files with Quicktime.  So if they've
downloaded TV episodes, game trailers, some movie trailers (which, in my
experience, tend to be .mov's)... etc... odds are they got and installed
the divx codec.  If not, you can grab it at divx.com.  I *think* Windows
XP will automagically grab the divx codec, but am not totally sure.   I
know Win9x doesn't like to do it automagically.

But so many people use b where they mean B or vice versa... after
recording some raw video, 67GB for an hour seemed closer to the mark

I haven't seen it, either... somebody else mentioned it earlier in the

It might be worth some googling, though.  I wonder if it will be able to
keep up with divx?

You're probably right.  Typically, even if the judge agreed that
requiring the company to GPL their software would be a legal/correct
judgement, he would also consider the impact doing so would have on the
company in question and temper his ruling based on that.  I suspect
almost any company could successfully argue that being forced to GPL
their code would mean the demise of the company and few judges are going
to intentionally dismantle a company over some copyright infringements
(unless it's Napster ;)

Still, as a fantasy, it's up there with my favorite featuring Bill Gates
being spanked with a flaming cat by Herve Villechaize, so try not to
rain on it, okay?

Not at all.  But that isn't what you said.  You said you wanted an
*equivalent* to Access on Linux, not Access itself on Linux.  Besides,

That sounds more like "systems you *don't* know".  If other systems take
you that much longer, it's most likely because you aren't familiar with
those systems.

Are you referring to the US economy?  That would explain a lot ;)

And have you actually followed up to see these user's experiences?  I'm
aware of plenty of systems where users have simply become used to the
flaws and don't complain about having to restore data, getting locked
out, crashes, having to avoid certain features, etc, etc.  They consider
it a basic cost of using computers.  It doesn't mean that there's
nothing wrong with the application, just that the users have figured out
how to live with it.

Not competing.  Simply using the best tools.

So Access sits at the top of the heap of toy databases.  Not much of an
accolade, IMO.

Because spreadsheets aren't typically used in a multi-user application
setting.  The basic paradigms don't fit.  How would an application
handle one user editing cell A1 while another tried to calculate the sum
of a range that included that cell?  I don't think you thought this out
very well.

This is pure hooey ;)  I've never even used Access on an unswitched
LAN.  Whether there were faulty NICs that somehow only corrupted Access
data, I can't be certain, but any software this intolerant to a
networked environment shouldn't be used in one.

What is it you are looking for?  Is it simply the GUI builder?  Frankly,
that's the only thing I can see where Access has any clear advantage
over anything else.  And that advantage is strongly mitigated by the
requirement to use VB.  Not to mention that the GUI builder, while
convenient, is hardly viable for building complex GUIs.

If you are simply looking for a good toolbox for developing database
applications, I'd suggest the following:

PostgreSQL (or MySQL, if your database requirements are simple)
Python
wxPython (see also Boa Constructor, for building GUI's)


Granted, you don't get the "all-in-one" development system Access
provides.  You also don't get the lack of scalability, the data
corruption, VB, the licensing fees, VB, VB, the vendor lock-in, etc.

What you do get is a robust and powerful database, a simple yet powerful
programming language and a very flexible GUI toolkit.  And it's all
cross-platform and open source.

That was just an example of where Access works well. I was asking for a
different application (that of my partner in a different venture).

That's not only because of familiarity. I was looking for a system that
is close to as easy and quick to handle as Access. With my partner's
basic knowledge of databases and experience with Access he would be OK
with learning a new system if it is not much more tedious to get things
done with it.

Not true since Access 97.

World wide. And it's very often a better thing than a $1mil SAP
installation that may never really get done and drains the budget to an
extend that a healthy upgrade path can't be followed.

Yes. They love the system and preserve boxes just to make sure it does
not get killed by updates. That's one of the big drawbacks of Access. It
is an Office component and so much integration can cause plenty of
problems.

With competing I mean trying to create or support other tools to break
the monopoly and keep the market moving. Aren't we all on this group
deliberately using less advanced tools for that purpose?

It's a big world out there with lots of cracks and spots for those who
create their own reality and still survive. Not talking about you, but
after seeing software developers taking years to develop something for
their clients that is obviously not up for the task. Nobody checks the
market and compares and so it becomes the accepted standard in this
crack.

Okay, then let's stick with what you're trying to accomplish and argue
the merits of Access *there* rather than in hypothetical or unrelated
ventures.

What is it about Access that makes it easy to use?  Honestly I found
MySQL to be far simpler than Access from a database perspective and
Python far simpler than VB (and more powerful as well) from a
programming POV.  So when you ask for something "like" Access, you
really should decide which features it provides that simplify life for
you (or your partner).  If it's the GUI-painter, then look for IDE's
that provide such a feature, if it's the administrative tools, then look
for those.  If it's the whole integration thing, then you probably won't
find it (yet).

It was 97 I used.  It sucked.  Constantly corrupting data.  It sucked
differently when I tried using ODBC to access MySQL to avoid the
corruption (constant claims that the database was "locked").  In the end
I saved time by just skipping the whole Access thing and writing a
front-end in Python for the MySQL database.

Er, who mentioned SAP or $1mil?  I thought we were talking open source
solutions (specifically database servers) versus MS Access.

Undoubtledly.  However, in all fairness, updates and headaches aren't
exclusive to Microsoft.

It depends on what you mean.  It's true that some of the tools I use
don't have all the bells and whistles of a MS product.  However, I've
found that all the flashy stuff means jack when it comes time to debug
an obscure problem.  OSS tools typically provide less obscure problems
than do proprietary products.  The development time saved by using a
fancy GUI builder will never outweigh the time saved by not having to
debug a bizarre interaction between DCOM, Access and a mouse driver from
3000 miles away ;)

I was referring to the date I started using Linux (against all the
realists advice to the contrary).  There is a fine line between being a
crackpot and being an early adopter. The simple fact was, it worked for
what I needed it to do.  There were no fancy GUIs or tools, but those
are just fluff for the most part anyway.  I think if you gave some other
tools a try, you might find the same thing about Access.  In most cases,
the GUI just makes it *appear* easy, it doesn't *really* make it any
easier.

I guess my point is that Access does nothing that I can't do by hand in
about the same amount of time (and better).  If you are a programmer, I
would think you could do the same.  If you aren't then perhaps that's a
different story.

I've got a remote server that I visited today. It was running very badly
and I couldn't figure it out. After an hour, I went for a reboot.

On reboot, I discovered that it did not think it still had a /dev/hda6
swap partition. dmseg shows:

Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 < hda5 >
 hdb: [PTBL] [1247/255/63] hdb1 hdb2 < hdb5 hdb6 hdb7 hdb8 hdb9 >

EXT2-fs warning: mounting unchecked fs, running e2fsck is recommended
EXT2-fs warning: mounting unchecked fs, running e2fsck is recommended
EXT2-fs warning: mounting unchecked fs, running e2fsck is recommended



The system has been up for a year or so, maybe two. I ran:
# fsck /dev/hda6
fsck 1.26 (3-Feb-2002)
fsck: fsck.swap: not found
fsck: Error 2 while executing fsck.swap for /dev/hda6

What do I do next? I have current backups, but I don't want to trash the
partition table. 

I'm looking to see how to find fsck.swap, it seems to be missing
somehow...

When you run fsck /some/partition it seems to check that partition type
and call fsck.thatpartitiontype.  In this case, it seems /dev/hda6 is a
swap partition, so it goes looking for fsck.swap, which it isn't finding
(and for good reason).

So, it seems /dev/hda6 is a swap partition.  You don't fsck those.

Check /etc/fstab and see what you have there that might need to be
fsck'd.  :-)

I was thinking you could just replace the fsck.swap from another running machine, but in the mean time you can just reformat the swap partition (mkswap /dev/hda6) and then turn the swap partition on (swapon -a).

Doh! I guess I should read the message more carefully (and turn my brain on). You won't have a fsck.swap because you don't fsck swap partitions. Try fdisking the drive to see what is really in the partition table. Does hda6 exist? If not, then it maybe something old that is left over in you fstab file. If it does exist, you might still try reformatting it.

AFAIK, there is no such thing.  A swap partition has no filesystem so
there is no reason to run a filesystem check (fsck) on it.  You can
simply run mkswap/swapon on it.  You should first verify the partition
table by running fdisk on it. 

The ext2 errors are probably unrelated, although it sounds as if you
should run fsck on your other partitions.

fsck is a file system checking utility, not a partition checking
utility.  Use fdisk /dev/hda to find out how the partition table is set
(don't worry, it won't write to the partition table unless you tell it
to).  This drive is probably starting to go bad, and should be
thoroughly tested with the manufacturer's utilities.

No need for such a tool:

swapoff /dev/hda6
mkswap /dev/hda6
swapon /dev/hda6

will reset a swap file system, but only if /dev/hda6 can be found.

It does actually.  I registers components with a CORBA Object Request

One of our users had me install VMware on his laptop, which runs
Windows 2000, and then install Linux in a virtual machine. I haven't
had much experience with VMware, but after a couple tries I got things
running smoothly.

One of this guy's requirements was that he be able to read and write
to the Windows filesystem from the Linux host. It turns out that
VMware supports this sort of thing natively, no samba required, via a
proprietary kernel module, vmhgfs. I exported his entire c: drive
under the share name 'c-drive'.

The resulting filesystem, typically /mnt/hgfs, is an odd thing:

* it won't show up when you run mount without arguments
* it won't show up in df results
* do a lsattr, chmod, chown, or chgrp on it, and all you'll get for
  your efforts is a bunch of error messages

The permissions look really restrictive to /bin/ls or a gui file
manager like nautilus. I'm doing this from memory, but this is pretty
close:

  dr-x------  root  root  /mnt/hgfs
  drwx------  root  root  /mnt/hgfs/c-drive

Oddly, however, is that a Linux user can still cd into those
directories, read and create files, etc.

Wierd, eh?

Anyway, I just thought I'd pass this along in case someone (else :-)
gets tripped up over the permissions on the exports, which look
restrictive but aren't.

Most likely, this is because Windows doesn't really have the same 
concept of user permissions as *nix.

The same reason you'll have a similar experience with samba and a 
Windows machine.

I have a spare partition on the system, hdb7. It's 270 megs or so, so I
tried mkswap /dev/hdb7, which locked up the system. Maybe because it was
mounted at the time.

The old partition that used to work was /dev/hda6. It is no where to be
found on the system, that I can find. Like the partition is completely
missing. I'm assuming I can find if it's still there with fdisk.

I'll try fdisking it after 5 when it goes into non-use.

Keep the ideas coming....

Mike

Maybe. My hunch is that it has more to do with how the VMware kernel
module operates than the NTFS filesystem -- but it's just a hunch. You
could easily be correct.

> The same reason you'll have a similar experience with samba and a
> Windows machine.

Except that with samba, the permissions look somewhat normal, even if
they're inaccurate. E.g.,

  directories == drwxr-xr-x    1 heinlein heinlein
  files       == -rwxr-xr-x    1 heinlein heinlein

That was the trick. top now reports swap usage.

I poked around in fdisk to be certain that the partition was actually
there, first. 

I hadn't seen this before, it was a little freaky.

Mike,

Another possibility that you might want to consider is that the drive is 
failing.  You might want to check your logs for warnings and errors when 
attempting to do I/O on the drive.  If it is failing, you'll want to move 
everything off of it and onto a replacement drive a.s.a.p.  Drive failures 
are the most frequent hardware failures and they happen more often than most 
people would expect.

That's simply a load of hooey.  I've run several systems with 10 or 20 
users, and they all worked fine.  Occasional corruption was always 
repairable except in one case, and that's what backups are for.  Of course, 
if the loss of a 1/2 days work is costy, then I agree, JET/MDB is not the 
right database engine, though at least for reporting, Access is still 
definitely the best front-end I know of.

I'm an Access developer, and I support the systems I create.  Right now, 
I'm helping a client update a system that's been running 'til now in Access 
2.0 (16-bit).

Well, best depends on what you're trying to accomplish, and in how much 
time.  it also depends on whether you want your client to be able to do 
basic maintenance themselves without having to learn a programming 
language.

Or simply working on projects with different priorities.

Is a spreadsheet Excel a toy because it's for smaller jobs?  Tell that to 
your CEO.  I'd say "small" rather than "toy" furthermore, I would not limit 
the scope to single-user systems.  Say what you will, database servers 
require at least part time database administrators, and require a 
maintenance of staff expertise during turnovers, etc.  In many cases, there 
is not a requirement for 24-hour up-time, rapid recovery from failures, 
ultra-fast performance, or lock-tight security.  In these cases, the cost 
of maintaining a server database is vastly too high.

For certain values of simple, and I agree.  Up to department scale, Access 
advantages outweigh its disadvantages.  Above than, the lack of better OOP 
and the invisibility of large parts of the application to the compiler lead 
to higher than acceptable defect ratios.

I don't see that we are disagreeing that much.  I would use JET for a 10 
user syste, and you wouldn't use it for more than 1.  We both agree it's 
not for large-scale deployments.

Well, I don't know where your problems came from, then.  Access back-ends 
do corrupt from time to time as one would expect in any shared-file system. 
 I certainly never found this to be a chronic issue unless there was some 
kind of problem with the network.

I guess we'll agree to differ on this.  Access does require occasional 
compact/repair operations to clean up problems before they affect data. 
 Any decent Access app will have a feature for doing this built-in.

I'm working on an Access fron-end to a PostgreSQL database now, and the DBA 
is having a hulluva time with it.  Perhaps, you are just more intelligent 
than him, but that just underscores the difference in complexity and cost 
of maintaining a server vs a file.  I guess if you're a DBA yourself, it's 
easy to think maintaining a server is no big deal.

That works out OK except the client has to pay me or another developer to 
come in and make any kind of a change.  That could price some of the 
projects I take out of the client's range.  Besides that, it takes no 
account of reporting.  Reporting is always a thorny issue, and Access 
handles it quite well.  There is also an appropriate amount of overlap 
between the Form/Report models so much of the GUI design and some of the 
code can simply be pasted from one to the other.

All good things, and all reasons I'm always considering everything as an 
option.  I'm actually learning Java and C# just now as alternatives for 
some projects.

Sorry - my bad.  I just realized how much traffic I was contributing, and 
it's not exactly on-topic.  I just get tired of everyone thinking that you 
can plug-and-play replace any app with a bunch of scripts, and be just as 
productive.

If an app fills a niche well, it's very valuable in the context it fills. 
 To replace it, you have to actually design something that has roughly the 
same advantages.  In this case, it hasn't been done, and I'm waiting for 
the day.  I think Meargent may get there soon.

I'm done adding to this thread now, and sorry for the excessive OT posting.

I saw no one suggesting scripts.  MySQL & PostgreSQL are certainly 
full-blown applications.  Python is a non-compiled language (maybe there is 
a compilier) but has the capability of V.Boli and then some.

Perhaps it's the weather, didn't mean to sound pissy, and I'm sure others 
were just trying to help.  Pray for rain...

My ISP, and various of my accounts that do have SMTP servers, all use
authenticated SMTP. So they don't care what email address I use as the

Don't take this the wrong way, but are you high, or just loaded with
money and forgotten the value of a dollar?  MS Access is $279 per
user.  In your scenario, how does $558 equate to "next to nothing?"
For that money, I could go apt-get install mysql and go spend that
$558 on rent and groceries and *still* have money left in my wallet.

Yes, but at $120/hr, which is what I believe Wil charges for consulting
services, the scripts to do with mysql which a computer literate college
graduate making $12/hr could do (assuming the same amount of time for
the scripts vs the gui) works out to about the same. And you don't have
to bring the consultant back in to change something minor in Access.

Access corrupts data, it's a closed, proprietary format, and its default
format is not an ACID-compliant database, but I can teach a monkey to
use it.

Anyway, I'm not sure why I even bothered to contribute to this, except
to say that I am very sad that there is not a good set of gui database
management tools out there for Linux, but either I don't know of them,
or they don't exist (and don't point me to a window wrapper around the
mysql command line. I'm talking about something that saves time. It's
true, when you're writing large applications, large databases, etc,
command line stuff saves time. But when you're putting together
something small, something quick and dirty, or something just quickly, a
full-fledged database SUCKS. Actually writing SQL for it SUCKS. And
nobody has recognized this.

I think I lost track of a parenthese.

Yeah, in the whole single-user,
can't-share-your-data-with-others-at-the-same-time-you're-using-it
sort of way.  If all that's using it is exactly one person, then yeah,
Access does it's job.  Or if you're using Access as a client for a
real DB.

Because spreadsheets tend to be used as ledgerbooks, not interactive

What makes you think that, when the problem has to do with two users
trying to write the same file with conflicting information?

Ugh... Debian's apt system is way too cumbersome and ugly for my use. 
I'd rather use LFS than to use a Debian or RPM based distro.

I didn't say I had any problems getting it going, personally... but it
is a pain, if not to actually get working (all I had to do with gentoo
was emerge mplayer, no fudging with source list stuff) then with the
legal ramifications of it all.

I'm no database administrator and mysql mostly maintains itself.  And
it has a far smaller memory footprint than Access, and quite a bit
zippier, even for single user jobs.  Odd how heavy Access is for a
single-user-only operation, yet doesn't scale at all.

Now you're just trying to justify wasting a career fixing broken toys.

2 is a large scale?

Which is why you run a server so only one entity is accessing the
files themselves, letting the users worry about actually doing their
jobs than if they're going to throw out today's work thanks to
corruption.  Why do you find wasting people's professional time that
way acceptable?

If that were the case, then it would cause similarly frequent problems
for other kinds of files.  Notice how it doesn't.

SQL in the same small user environments doesn't.

Or read Carla Schroeder's(?) howto in Computer Bits from a couple
months back.  I believe that article listed off some open-source
alternatives as well.

In most business cases $279 for a RAD tool IS next to nothing. No matter
how many gallons of milk you can buy for it. 

In my situation, just coincidentally, it costs me nothing because I
already have it. But that's another sad story.

Then you *do* have SMTP servers for all those accounts, you're just
using your ISP's to send instead.

No, I do not.

Examine this example: accounts a and b.

Account A has POP or IMAP access only -- on their servers, there is no
SMTP server that I am allowed to use.

Account B has a POP or IMAP server, but also an authenticated SMTP
server.

To send email from account A, I log in to the SMTP server for Account B,
authenticate, and then send an email whose From: header says Account A,
thereby forging the signature, technically.

You're misunderstanding.

Yes, there is an SMTP server associated with that server. Yes, I receive
email through an SMTP server, very indirectly. But directly, for sending
email, I have NO ACCESS, to the SMTP server. I get my mail through POP
or IMAP. To send an email from this email address, I have to use another
system's SMTP server.

You misunderstand.

Any binary-based package management system, IMHO, sucks totally.  I use
binary packages only as a last resort, because they tend to be
cumbersome and ugly.  If you start throwing wild dependencies into the
mix, it only gets uglier.

Gentoo's portage system I can stand to use.  It's *very simple* to get
it to do exactly what I want it to do, then it tracks packages enough to
make uninstallation simple enough.  On any real... production system...
I compile most everything from source, using Slackware's setup as a nice
customizable base.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0309050814100.30483@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  For the book I'm writing now I need to create many illustrative plots.
These are line graphs (Y axis on the left, X axis on the bottom) with
bell-shaped curves, S-curves, Z-curves, triangular curves or trapezoidal
curves. Many figures will have multiple curves on the same set of axes.

  If I had real data to plot I'd use gri. However, these are illustrations,
not real data plots so it would be a major effort to cobble together a
contrived data file to draw each illustration using gri.

  So I'm looking for an alternative. The 'dia' Web site appears to be down.
I believe that 'sketch' is a possibility and I strongly suspect that xfig
would do a top-notch job (if I knew how to use it). I would greatly
appreciate feedback, suggestions and advice from those of you who have used
any of these tools (particularly xfig). The output needs to be .eps for
inclusion in a LaTeX document (go LyX!).

  I've scanned the sketch Web site and read the xfig man page. Having used
neither I've no feel for capabilities or ease of learning/use.

TIA,

Rich

Why do you prefer to manually manage dependencies and compile from

To me, "occasional corruption" is unacceptable in a database. 
Especially one you have to pay per seat licensing for.  I ran a MySQL
database for over a year with over 90 users and *never* had any
corruption.  All software has problems, however I prefer to stick with
software where problems are exception, rather than the rule.

That is certainly true.  However, I still stick with my earlier premise
that using toy software in a commercial deployment is a risk.  People do
it all the time and manage, but you have to wonder what they could have
accomplished had they chosen to go with a better system.  Having a SQL
server allows for a lot of integration and centralization of data.  You
can probably manage the same with Access, but the more data you start
storing in your database, the more reliability and scalability become a
factor, and these are the places Access is way behind other products.

Possibly.  However, I also try not to look at a project's priorities
without considering things like long-term expandability and
interoperability.  If a customer just wants a simple database for
storing inventory, Access sounds good.  But I also consider the
probability that they will also eventually want accounting and payroll,
customer lists, that they might one day want to stick that data behind a
web server for online transactions*, etc.  There might be a bit of
initial overhead to using a SQL server, but in the long run it pays off.

*Yes, I know some people have used Access as a backend for web
applications.  Please don't admit to being one of those ;)

  The last time I checked on this -- about 2 years ago -- jocr was the

Preface this with the fact that I am a mostly happy Debian user from
way back, but one of the things binary-based package systems tend to
do is freeze in what ought to be optional dependencies.  For example,
the Debian Samba packages used to (still does?) depend on a particular
printing system (CUPS, I think), which seems just wacky to me.  Once
you have to start dragging around these superfluous tentacles, you can
end up sweeping along a _lot_ of stuff you never really wanted to
begin with.  Now, the one thing about dragging around these
superfluous dependencies is that it is _mostly_ painless with Debian,
because Debian makes that part easy.

The nice thing about something like Gentoo, which I've just started
playing with, is that there is a little more opportunity to fiddle
with compile-time choices.  Karl Hegbloom once muttered something
about being able to do this from Debian source packages, but I have
never managed to concentrate long enough to understand all of the
build goo that Debian uses well enough to mutate reliably.  So far,
I've been able to comprehend Gentoo's build system a little better.

I may be speaking out of turn, but with Gentoo you're not manually managing your
dependencies.  You are able to cut out some dependancies that a precompiled
version would force on you.

  Hokay, xfig will do the job. As a matter of fact, the new X-spline routine
(that's replaced the former B-spline and Bezier-spline) is absolutely ideal
for my needs. I can change the curve response on a point-by-point basis to
get exactly the shape I need.

Source dependencies are a lot more flexible than binary dependencies. 
Rarely is the source code released against a very specific set of
library versions or 'extras' that may or may not be present on my
system.

For example... I can compile GAIM with or without PERL support.  If I
don't feel like installing Perl on a system, I just don't put it on
there.  However, if said binary distribution decided to build GAIM with
Perl support, now everybody who uses GAIM needs Perl installed on their
system.

When you compile software on your system, it builds it against your
system... its headers and libraries.  If you start switching out those
libraries, you run in to problems.  If you build from source, however,
you just don't run in to those problems... sure, dependency tracking
comes in to play to save the day there, but it seems so much uglier from
my point of view.

And... I've never seen an optimized distribution.  I pick my CXXFLAGS
and CFLAGS depending on what I'm compiling and on what system I'll be
using it on.  If stability isn't paramount, but speed is... I season to
taste.

You just can't beat the power you gain over a system if you drop all
those binary packages out the window.  :-)

I thought you were doing that for Access databases?  Or are you claiming
that they maintain themselves?  If so, what do your customers pay you
for?

There is always a requirement for these things.  The only reason people
don't think there is is because of the shoddy state of commercial
software these days.  Microsoft has lowered people's expectations.

Okay, so I guess we can simply define our disagreement as a matter of
scale (1 vs 10).  And I'll point out again that I don't have too much of
a problem using Access as a client to a server backend.  Not necessarily
what I'd choose most of the time (I still hate VB), but a reasonable
configuration that leverages the strengths of both approaches.

There are undoubtedly problems in most networks of any reasonable size. 
This will also probably increase as low-cost networking hardware becomes
more common due to increased home use.  However, my point remains that
software that is meant to run in a networked environment should be
somewhat tolerant to this.  Access' architecture (file locking/sharing)
has long been considered the most brittle way of sharing resources.

Reporting is a PITA, in fact in the past I've used Python and COM to
generate reports in Excel which I found to be a fairly usable combo. 
There are also modules for Python for generating PDF files (ReportLab)
so that probably wouldn't be necessary today.

Which is why, in your particular case, I'd suggest that perhaps Access
over PostgreSQL (or even MySQL) would be a good fit.

I'm watching the drive like a hawk.

Most of the data is backed up on another drive in the system, but it's
not protected by RAID.

Thanks for the suggestion.

Well, I haven't used Debian, so perhaps apt performs some magic there
that I'm not aware that I'm missing, but having used it for the last
year or so on RedHat I haven't had any real problems.  In fact it seems
to work better than most of the alternatives.  It might work best on
Debian, but I'd hardly categorize it as working "poorly" on RedHat.

Some of the Uber-sensitive folks moved over to PdxLug, but yes there are 
still plenty of OT sensitive folks on this list. I suppose what annoys 
me the most is the amount of bandwidth that ends up being wasted by 
people saying "This is sooooo off topic, blah, blah, blah, take it off 
list: Is not: Is too: IS NOT: IS TOO...etc". The irony slays me.

Which isn't to say people don't stray off topic, but it's just not that 
hard to ignore a thread (IMHO). Occasionally a designated list admin has 
stepped in to ask that a thread be moved off line, but that's 
exceedingly rare.

On some international lists, the bandwidth issue is real (they pay by
the kb in some countries).  Here in Portland it's rather lame to
complain about receiving 10k of unwanted topic.

Typically I don't mind OT threads.  I spend a lot of time on usenet and
mailing lists and there is always a percentage of OT conversations. I've
seen threads in comp.lang.python covering everything from history,
politics, language (the human kind), gun control, etc.  All *way* OT,
but that's part of engaging in conversations with intellectual people. 
I think if you find a list that *never* strays OT you've probably found
a bunch of boring monodendrites ;)

  This is an intelligence art called "pattern analysis".  You don't need to
read the message to glean information about the communication.  You can tell
a lot about an organization by watching the information that leaks out
around the edges.

  This is serious stuff.  The Pentagon set up an in-house pizza delivery
after reporters started getting hot "something's happening" tips from
Domino's delivery boys.  A lot of the overhead reconnaissance stuff is based
on pattern analysis tricks.  

  "Zero knowledge" means not leaking *any* information your attacker could
use.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0309051042030.19419-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I'm currently stuck using a WinXT system at work but am able to use
Mozilla.  The issue is I often work from home (sometimes 'cause I hasta
and sometimes 'cause I wantta) and but don't have all the bookmarks I've 
created at work and can't always remember what they are.

Is there a fairly painless way to copy the WinXP Mozilla stuff to a Linux 
Mozilla user?
   I've tried modifying the Linux/Mozilla bookmarks file both from within 
a X-Windows System session (not good) and from a console login with 
varying success.  Seems Mozilla creates two (or more) users directories 
per user ... sometimes.  Damn confusing.

Pointers, links, clue-stick strikes are appreciated.

afaik, sftp got recursive capabilities only recently. If you're
running an older version, then you're out of luck.

Try scp instead:

  cd /local/target/dir
  scp -r remote.host.tld:/remote/target/dir .

Fair enough.  I will.  However, just be clear that if you think I'm
going to "take it outside" the minute a thread wanders the slightest bit
OT then you're bound to be disappointed.  

Incidentally, does anyone here *really* think arguing the virtues of
Access vs PostgreSQL on a Linux list is terribly OT?

If so, please indicate that position by wearing a tag on your shirt that

  I don't think it would make a difference.  My SMP machine has a
"ksoftirqd" process for each CPU.  Tasks get pulled off the queue and then
run on the "correct" processor.  The definition of "correct" depends on the
kernel version you're using.

  Each task doesn't know or care what CPU it's scheduled to run on.  Good
SMP programming practices should take care of any other issues.

As far as I know, sftp can't do recursion.  The way I do it (when I use
command line for this) is to do an ls, and lmkdir all directories, then
lcd and cd into each directory, look for more directories to create. 
Once the directories are all in place, you can start to copy files.  If
you started copying files before the directories were created, sftp will
abort while trying to read a directory as a file, and a file will be
created with the name of the directory.

The easy way out of this is to create a tar ball (compressed if you are
copying over the Internet), then copy just the one file.

Go to Bookmarks>File Bookmarks. This will open the bookmark manager.

In the bookmark manager, go to Tools>Export. From there, you can export 
an html version.

On the other system, open the bookmark manager and go to Tools>Import. 
Select the file, and there ya go.

You can export your bookmarks in WinXP to a html file, then import in

Dependencies in portage are as automatic as any binary package
system, and a little more flexible.

One of the reasons I installed Gentoo is I found that, for me,
binary-based distributions were encouraging bad habits.  I no
longer had any intuitive feel for the size or complexity of any
piece of software I was using.  I was falling into black-box
debugging helplessness.  I was getting locked into finding and
installing exact version numbers of shared libraries.  I was
running out-of-date software simply because it wasn't easy to
upgrade just one thing, I'd have to upgrade the whole system
because of all the interrelated dependencies.  etc.

After installing Gentoo... I've discovered I need a _lot_ more
disk to do a debuggable source-based installation these days.
And more ram and cpu power would help for building all those
things that want to compile with -O3 or so.

Hey Rich,

I missed your question in all of the recent shouting about Access and the 
absolute superiority of some distros over others.  You might also take a look 
at Xmgrace, which descended from Xmgr.  It is available at

http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/

It has very nice features, is more polished than Xfig (which I also like very 
much), and gives you complete control over your plots.  But I haven't played 
with the spline feature and can't say whether it will satisfy your needs.

You don't have to make it debuggable to let it take up lots of room...

If you don't go through and clean up after portage, it tends to eat a
lot of hard drive space... I play with this system *a lot* ... and
regularly clear out 2+ GB (which is significant since Linux has 10GB of
space on this ol' laptop).

Mark,

  Polished, schmolished. As long as it creates the figures I'm happy.
There's also xfigure (or something like that).

  After trying to figure out gnuplot a number of years ago I stumbled across
Gri and I've used that ever since for scientific data plots. When I asked
the authors why they wrote it -- since it essentially duplicates gnuplot --
they told me that they weren't aware of gnuplot (!!) so they created their
own for oceanic research.

  And, of course, in the bitmapped graphic world, there's GIMP, xv and a
bunch of others.

  Because I'm essentially a really lazy curmudgeon, I pick one that does
what I need to have done, learn it and go on to trying to make money.

Thanks for the pointer,

Rich

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0309051331380.31158@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Mark Martin suggested a tool called 'grace' as a replacement for xfig.
However, from my understanding of the Web site it is another replacement for
gnuplot: a data plotting program. These programs take data points and plot
them using various formats.

  Plotting applications are a completely different application from a vector
drawing application. The later uses vector primatives such as points, lines,
circles and rectangles to produce a drawing that is not tied to any measured
data set. They are the digital equivalent of the Etch-A-Sketch (TM) deluxe
edition.

  The third category of graphics applications are the bit-mapped ones such
as xv, the gimp, xpaint and probably a dozen others. Rather than working
with geometric objects (as the vector drawing applications do) or data files
(as the plotting applications do), this class works with pixels.

  An analogy, but arguably not a terribly good one, is the range of text
processing applications. There are plain text editors (such as emacs, vi,
joe) that are ideally suited for a certain category of tasks (system/network
administration, coding, e-mail). For different needs, there are the word
processors such as OpenOffice.org's Writer, KWord and AbiWord. These use a
proprietary or tagged format for the data files and provide formatting and
other desireable features when the text needs to be distributed as treeware.
The final text application class consists of typesetting software; TeX and
its derivatives LaTeX and LyX are the only occupants of this niche to my
knowledge.

  So, while I appreciate the helpful pointer, grace is not capable of doing
the illustration drawings I need.

Did you look at QCad?  It's what I use for simple stuff.  I'm not sure
what you mean by "illustration" (art? technical drawings? cartoons?) but
QCad is decent for simple technical stuff.

Trouble accessing the mailman adminstration pages thru my web server.  I get this traceback error.

    class Mailbox(mailbox.PortableUnixMailbox):
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'PortableUnixMailbox'

I've checked and the mailbox.py module does have that class included.  The python2.1 version did not.
I've even removed python2.1.  A possible complication is that I'm running my web server on a separate machine than mailman and postfix.  I used smbmount to mount /var/lib/mailman and /usr/lib/mailman on the web server machine.  

Not sure what to try next.

Rich,

I just read your additional posting and I know the difference between vector 
and raster graphics.  Xmgrace allows you to create vector plots and it will 
create Postscript (encapsulated or otherwise), PDF, and SVG (i.e. scalable 
vector graphics) output, which *are* vector formats.  It also allows you to 
use splines, which is what you said you needed.  But, if it isn't for you, it 
isn't for you.  Flame away, if you must.

Mark

P.S. I felt compelled to respond to both threads of this discussion.  
Apologies to those of you who read this twice.

Rich,

To beat a dead horse (since you already found a solution you like), part of 
what I mean by "polished" is "less buggy".  I've had Xfig crash at 
inopportune moments (Of course, I not sure when the opportune moments to 
crash are.) but I've never had this problem with Xmgrace.  Xfig has been 
around for over 10 years, in my recollection, but it's still a little rough 
around the edges.  (Maybe Xfig's development community is no longer very 
large or maybe even nonexistent?)

I used to xfig to create the house plans to get remodeling permits.  It is 
amazingly capable--got several comments on how nice the drawings were.  It's

Also /usr/portage/packages if you had it set to build binary packages

This is weird.  Python appears to be importing a file that doesn't
exist.  The "import mailbox" command doesn't try to import the one in
/usr/lib/python2.2.  It seems to be importing one from
/var/lib/mailman/Mailman.

That is a directory I mounted via samba so I could install mailman on
the machine that has postfix (the web server is on a different
machine).

On machine A: 
$ ls -al /var/lib/mailman/Mailman/mailbox.py
-rwxr--r--    1 root     root         3876 Sep  5 15:01
/var/lib/mailman/Mailman/mailbox.py

The mailman directory is the mount point for /var/lib/mailman on
machine B

On machine B:
# ls -al /var/lib/mailman/Mailman/mailbox.py
ls: /var/lib/mailman/Mailman/mailbox.py: No such file or directory

A "find / -name mailbox.py -print" only turns up one file (on each
system)

Yeah, xfig is fun and has been around forever, but lately I've
been playing with sodipodi, which does modern tricks like
anti-aliasing, alpha transparency, gradient fill, etc.  It's not
stable yet though.

After re-reading Rich's posts, I will admit that Xmgrace is probably not the 
best tool for his purposes and that I should have read his messages more 
carefully.  But you *can* draw in Xmgrace as well as plotting data and 
someone could benefit from using it for vector drawings, especially if they 
need to mix plots of data and drawings as I have had to do in the past.

As usual, for whatever it's worth,

The problem with using any sort of package management on RPM based
systems is that RPM is utterly broken thanks to multiple distros all
producing their own versions of the same packages in RPM, none of them
compatible.  Further complicating things, often times people have a
tendancy of writing depends on individual files instead of packages,
and nobody in the RPM world seems to be able to decide just what
package is supposed to be called what.

In the .deb world, everybody's debs are compatible with each other's
distros, you can mix and match without too much hassle.  If you want
to switch between .deb based distros, no re-installation is
necissary.  Just change your sources.list to some other distro's
package servers, apt-get update, apt-get dist-upgrade and after
everything's downloaded, you've changed distros.  Depending on
individual files is (thankfully) not possible, so we don't suffer from
that sort of stupidity, and everybody just uses the Debian package
names to prevent the package naming stupidity chronic to RPM.

I agree.  Posting exclusively to say that something is off topic is
always, in itself, off topic.  Bonus points is it makes the person
doing it look about as bright as the average AOL user.  procmail is
your friend.

Especially if you use a MUA that understands threads properly (using
the References header or equivilent, instead of subject).  This is
also a good reason *NOT* to start a new thread by hitting reply in
another thread:  It appears as topic drift mid-thread to people with
non-broken MUAs[1].


[1] IMHO, your MUA is broken if it doesn't, at the very least, support
proper threading and have Reply-to-List.

I know someone mentioning samba in Debian and CUPS, I had the same
thought the other day.  dman gives explaination:  Samba doesn't depend
on cups and never has; the library suggests cups and by default, apt
goes for suggestions.  You can change this behaviour prodding around
in /etc/apt/

It doesn't.  It only depends on the client library (libcupsys2).
It needs libcupsys2 because it was compiled with CUPS support so that
samba can automatically determine all the available printers from the
CUPS infrastructure.  (that doesn't mean you need to run cups, or even
if you use cups the 'cupsd' server could be on a different machine)

Reflecting on it I noted the deeper irony that while one can simply 
ignore an entire thread, once an "Off-topic/On-topic" flame war erupts 
within a thread that one is actively reading there's no easy way of 
filtering out the noise (except to block the person who's shouting "off 
topic" individually).

I certainly can't argue with this.  It doesn't seem to be rpm that's so
broken as much as the packagers ;)  I usually stick with freshrpms.net
(which includes official RH updates) so as to avoid getting stuff from
all over.  There's also some work between the maintainers of the major
apt repositories for RH to increase compatibility with each other, so
hopefully that will help to set some sort of standard.

I don't think you'd want to try that in the RPM world ;)  I have used
quite a few Mandrake and Connectiva on RH, but I don't think I'd try to
upgrade to their distro w/o a reinstall ;)

Subject: [PLUG] Email spam...
Message-ID: <1062871013.1606.40.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Well I've discovered the hard way that blocking ips doesn't work very
well though I am wondering if I the following is a reasonable anti
smut approach:

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
DROP       all  --  67.30.135.152        0.0.0.0/0          
DROP       all  --  63.66.136.100        0.0.0.0/0          
DROP       all  --  67.30.133.77         0.0.0.0/0          
DROP       all  --  64.214.130.56        0.0.0.0/0          

These sites are either directly sending it to me or in
some cases I think they are relays.

I've sent a complaint to abuse at level3.com, maybe they
can stop some of the the porn properly.  It's frustrating, 
anyone can sign you up for something where there seem to 
be no rules that a content provider has to honor to get 
you off their mailing lists.  Some of these sites say 
don't enter if your under age, but anyone can go into
a lot of them.  I wonder how an undercover police person 
would feel if he/she couldn't get off one of these sites
after investigating it?

I get some stuff that I'm fairly sure nobody ever 
subscribed to.  Viagra ads are pretty common.

Looking at email's form it seems if a header 
is at all faked that there's a high probability 
it's spam.  How do you find out if certain sites 
only send objectionable material as I would think 
you could just block them.  If you filter email
at your own site, that in affect encourages the 
sender to keep sending it to you.  Unfortunately,
the approach of blocking email servers comes with 
other problems.  I think part of the problem is 
that a lot of the porn mail sources appear to be 
individual private email addresses.  There are
darn near an infinite number of private email
addresses compared to the number of ISP's
and formal content providers.

How does sendmail or any other MTA decide to 
send to an intermediary mail transfer agent 
instead of attempting a direct connection to 
the destination?

Is it me or is AT&T really bad about relaying
pornographic materials?  If I didn't know any
better, I'd think it's a big business for some
of these phone companies to distribute this
stuff to whomever they can.  It's probably 
as bad for some people as it would
be to put a bar in an alcoholic's house 
where only the alcoholic frequents it 
and the bar never goes dry.
 
There's other problem areas for Internet 
delivered content as well, some video 
games have absorbed people so completely 
that they have committed suicide just to 
stop playing.

It stands for Mail User Agent (aka "email client" or "email program"),

Subject: [PLUG] Updating PHP in RedHat 7.3
Message-ID: <3F5A5A3D.2000603@adnap.no-ip.com>

Hello everyone,

I am trying to update PHP on my system from 'php-4.1.2-7.3.6' to 
'php-4.3.2-7'.  Having seen all the trashing of RPM lately, I thought it 
would be a fun time to bring up my problems with RPM dependencies. ;-)

Here's what happens:

[root at adnap root]# ls php-* | cat
php-4.3.2-7.i386.rpm
php-imap-4.3.2-7.i386.rpm
php-ldap-4.3.2-7.i386.rpm

php-odbc-4.3.2-7.i386.rpm
php-pgsql-4.3.2-7.i386.rpm

[root at adnap root]# rpm -Uhv php-*

Does this look like reasonable depenencies?  Does it look like I will be 
able to meet them (and not break everything)?

It's important that PHP not be broken for any length of time.

I am considering switching distros if I can't fix this.  In that case, 
what is the best distro for being able to update software without 
updating the entire system?

Thanks,
Evan

Spammer gangs are CONTINOUSLY taking email addresses found by their
dirty trick programs, and "laundering" them by submitting those
addresses to whatever site they can find.  That is the source of their
claims that they have hundreds of millions (or more; I saw a piece of
spam recently that claimed the con artist had 2.8 billion email
addresses, all of which were eager to receive msgs from the con
artists clients).

A few years ago a reporter (in the Seattle area, I think), followed up
one of the ads you occasionally see stuck up on telephone poles about
making money with your home computer.  The so called job he was given
was to register lists of email addresses with different sites.  He was
to be paid a few cents per address.

Spammer gangs also sign up for mailing lists (like the ones associated
with sourceforge projects, etc.) and try to use their membership status
to get a list of members.  They then add those addresses to their ill
gotten lists, trade them back and forth to try to hide their origin,
sign them up for lists so they can claim you've "opted in", etc.

That's just a small bit of my rants on spam....

More related to the the original message, you can try blocking senders
using your firewall, but you could easily hit capacity problems.  It's
better to block using sendmail, postfix, etc. access lists.

I currently have almost 8000 ip addresses, email addresses, domains and
sub-domains blocked because spammer gangs have used them to "try" to
send junk to me.  The list grows on average by at least 10-20 a week.

It looks like it requires glibc 2.3, which could break a lot of stuff
when it upgrades. =)

You could try the apt tool for red hat, though I'm not sure how to go
about doing that, since I don't use it.

s/best/only

debian-based. Not necessarily debian, just debian based. Knoppix,
Xandros, or any other debian-based distro will work beautifully for
this. 

In addition, if you want to use Debian with the Progeny installer (much
easier to use), or the old, defunct Stormix / StormLinux (if you can get
a copy) those will both work to install sufficient of a debian system on
them that you can then upgrade to the current version. Now if you want
PHP 4.3, you're going to have to go to testing (sarge). Stable has an
older version than that.

Everybody says shitty things about Debian's installer, and they're right
(though not for servers--it's just setting up X that's a pain). But
nobody really says anything bad about Debian once its set up.

Blocking IPs does not work because spammmers are shifty devious bastards who 
keep moving around. They exploit open relays and open proxies. The 
relationship between spam and viruses is not accidental- spammers love all 
those easily owned Windows boxes to relay their spew through.

Trying to block email based on content is not going to work very well. It's 
the same problem that Web filters like Net Nanny run into- software is 
incapable of evaluating context.

I shall bite back the obvious smart-aleck reply.... :) Expecting spammers of 
any kind, or spam-friendly service providers, to behave honestly or honorably 
is not going to work either.

Again, content-based filtering doesn't work. Your best bet is to block spam, 
period.

Interesting issues, that are probably better suited to plug-talk. On the issue 
of fighting spam, which has become an interesting sideline for me, there are 
many strategies to choose from. To simply keep it out of your inbox, a 
combination of DNSRBLs and Spamassassin work very well. 

To fight back to try to stop the spew, which can consume a lot of time and 
energy, you can do things like report spams through Spamcop.net, sue under 
any applicable laws, post spams to news-admin net-abuse-sightings, and 
support anti-spam legislation, should you find any worth supporting. Start 
with the Spamfaq at http://www.spamfaq.net/, it's a good introduction.

And Libranet, Xandros etc. take the pain out of installation. The latest 
Libranet- 2.8.1- is great for a desktop Debian. It's based on Sarge, so the 
apps are up-to-date, and Libranet's hardware detection is very good.

For users who want to stick with Red Hat, try the Ximian desktop with Red 
Carpet. Red Carpet is the most pain-free installer and updater in the Red 
Hat/ Mandrake world, IMO it is the best solution for someone wanting a Red 
hat-based desktop system, without getting sucked into RPM hell.

Firewall rules aren't a good way to block spam -- they're too rigid and
high maintenance to provide a practical, long-term protection approach.

SpamAssassin is much easier and more effective:  http://spamassassin.org

Let me know what you need in exchange or if I can just give you some

and vulnerable formail.cgi scripts... :P I had a client once who had an
insecure formail.cgi script on our web server and a spammer managed to
send a ton of porn spam out before we shut the script down.

Simply blocking an IP most certainly won't work...

Yes, because the binary you have is built against a later glibc.  Grab
the srpm and rebuild it with 'rpm --rebuild php*.src.rpm'.

I'm sure a lot of people (including myself) could give you all three 
discs at the clinc on the 20th.  If you have a burner and a non-modem, 
you can download from most redhat mirrors, including this one:

ftp://limestone.uoregon.edu/redhat/7.3/en/iso/i386/valhalla-i386-disc1.iso
ftp://limestone.uoregon.edu/redhat/7.3/en/iso/i386/valhalla-i386-disc2.iso
ftp://limestone.uoregon.edu/redhat/7.3/en/iso/i386/valhalla-i386-disc3.iso

P.S. What does "Dont immanentize the eschaton" mean? :-/

Wouldn't it be better to upgrade glibc?  I guess I'm wondering
what all the glibc upgrade problems are really about?  Are there
a lot of programs that depend on non persistent features out
there?  How does Linux link to the glibc insofar as what one
could do to have multiple versions available for different
software and have it link correctly?

Here's what that does:

[root at adnap root]# rpm --rebuild php-4.3.2-7.src.rpm
Installing php-4.3.2-7.src.rpm
cat: /usr/include/httpd/.mmn: No such file or directory
error: failed build dependencies:
         db4-devel is needed by php-4.3.2-7
         aspell-devel >= 0.50.0 is needed by php-4.3.2-7
         httpd-devel >= 2.0.40-6 is needed by php-4.3.2-7
         imap-devel is needed by php-4.3.2-7
         net-snmp-devel is needed by php-4.3.2-7
[root at adnap root]#

Is the recommendation to get the srpm for all those things?  rpmfind.net 
does not have a db4-devel for RH 7.3.  And my httpd is not 2.0.  Will 
that cause a problem as well?

I'm off to supper now.  Thanks for all your help!
Evan

Carla,

> And Libranet, Xandros etc. take the pain out of installation.

Because of your article months ago in Computer bits, I downloaded and
install Libranet 2.0, and I've recently gotten 2.7-Classic. My machine
triple-bots Redhat 8, ELX, and Libranet. My problem is with mounting NFS
shares. The /etc/fstab files are identical in all three, with respect the
the NFS references. In RH and ELX, they mount almost instantly. In
Libranet, they mount, but only after many minutes and error messages:

Portmap: Server localhost is not respondig, timed out
Lockd_up: makesock failed, error=-5
Portmap: Server localhost is not respondig, timed out
Locked_up: no pid, 2 users??
Portmap: Server localhost is not respondig, timed out
Locked_up: no pid, 3 users??
Portmap: Server localhost is not respondig, timed out
Locked_up: no pid, 4 users??

and continues on for each share. I can ping the server just fine and my
Internet connection is good, suggesting the nic is set up OK. I've
install Libranet on two machines and they both experience this behavior.
Any ideas?

Thanks!
Paul

PS: I posted this to the Libranet mailing list as well.

I'm down to about .0098% spam with my solution.  First half is using
the setup described recently (did you search the archives?).  Second
half is report all the spam you get after that.

First off, like most of the HOWTOs I've seen on tldp, I assume Debian
because it's what I use[1].  If this doesn't match up with your RPM based
distro, that's a personal problem, switch to Xandros, Knoppix
installed to a hard drive, Debian, or another similarly sane distro.
8:o)

Here's what I have done to get my site down to ~0.009% spam.  All
packages are in sid, so if you're using woody, don't be stupid, use
backports and DO NOT USE APT-PINNING.  If you need to know why, google
for apt pin harmful site:lists.debian.org.

Get exim-daemon-heavy and sa-exim (it'll pull in the necissary
depends, like spamassassin).  Out of the box, you'll have an automatic
teergrube (anything that scores higher than 30 gets teergubed instead
of delivered, watch the headers sa-exim puts in
/var/log/exim4/reject.log to make sure this is a sane number, though
the default is high enough that I've yet to see any ham get nailed by
it).

Then, go dig around through
/etc/exim4/conf.d/acl/30_exim4-config_check_rcpt and add this to the
(empty) blacklist section.  Please note: When you use RBLs, please do
the RBL maintainers a *huge* favor by *not* mentioning them in your
reject messages (do not use the defaults).  It only appears to serve
to confuse users and anger some, the angry ones then turn around and
harass the RBL maintainers for blocking their email, something that
the maintainers had zero to do with.  Also, spammers that use
dropboxes in their From: will get the bounces, see who is giving them
the most grief, and DDOS them (witness osirusoft).

<example>

  # Currently spamming

  deny  message         = Your mail server is currently spamming.  You can either wait it out or find an ethical ISP.
        log_message     = $sender_host_address is listed at $dnslist_domain ($dnslist_value: $dnslist_text)
        dnslists        = bl.spamcop.net

  # Broken sites that refuse bounce messages, God only knows if

  deny  message         = Your domain refuses bounce messages, despite breaking RFCs 821, 2821, 2505 and 1123.  Contact your mail provider to have this fixed.
        log_message     = $sender_address_domain is listed at $dnslist_domain ($dnslist_value: $dnslist_text)
        dnslists        = dsn.rfc-ignorant.org/$sender_address_domain

# There are a *lot* of ignorant/retarded sites that fail to have a
# postmaster.  This would probably make a better spamassassin +1.000 rule.

#  deny message         = Your domain refuses mail to postmaster, despite breaking RFC 2821.  Contact your mail provider to have this fixed.

#       dnslists        = postmaster.rfc-ignorant.org/$sender_address_domain


# Sites with bad whois data are almost always spammers, except in the
# UK.  The UK, for reasons beyond my comprehension, has no whois.  The

        log_message     = $sender_address_domain is listed at $dnslist_domain ($dnslist_value: $dnslist_text)
        sender_domains  = !*.uk
        dnslists        = whois.rfc-ignorant.org/$sender_address_domain

# Fortunately, it doesn't appear anybody legitimate has a broken
# ipwhois (or if I'm wrong, I haven't been burned by it yet).

  deny  message         = Your domain has bad ipwhois information, despite breaking RFC 954.  Please contact your mail provider to have this problem fixed.
        log_message     = $sender_host_address is listed at $dnslist_domain ($dnslist_value: $dnslist_text)
        dnslists        = ipwhois.rfc-ignorant.org

# Known spam havens.

  deny  message         = All mail from China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Brazil, Nigeria and Taiwan is rejected.  Please clean up your collective act and kill your spammers.
        log_message     = $sender_host_address is listed at $dnslist_domain ($dnslist_value: $dnslist_text)
        dnslists        = brazil.blackholes.us : cn-kr.blackholes.us : nigeria.blackholes.us : taiwan.blackholes.us

</example>

This combinations of RBLs turns up about one false positive every four
months or so for my site.

I'm sure a lot of people (including myself) could give you all three
discs at the clinc on the 20th.  If you have a burner and a non-modem,
you can download from most redhat mirrors, including this one:

ftp://limestone.uoregon.edu/redhat/7.3/en/iso/i386/valhalla-i386-disc1.iso
ftp://limestone.uoregon.edu/redhat/7.3/en/iso/i386/valhalla-i386-disc2.iso

Buckley has always struck me as somebody who found himself far more
amusing that most other people found him.  This Quote is a perfect
example, a four word sentence that contains to major words that are so
obscure so as to not be in a standard dictionary.

Sounds like an attempt to recreate "Eschew obfuscation" only with out
the irony.

Perhaps it is a symptom of aging. He was boorish when I was in high
school 35 years ago. Now when I read him, his use of the English
language is superior to many of my present college level Professors
and far exceeds most, if not all, the tech writers and novelist I
read. Part of his humor is in the exact use of a word in a critical
space. Thirty years from now, perhaps he will once again be boorish in
his interpretation of social events of the moment.

Sounds like that version was built for a different set of packages than
you have installed.

Rebuild the rpms from the source rpm and see if that works better.

Subject: [PLUG] Different versions of gtk and glib...
Message-ID: <1062972562.16406.4.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm going through a YoLinux tutorial on gtk and am wondering why Redhat
7.3 has three versions of glib, multiple gtk versions, etc.

There are also multiple glib devel packages.

I haven't installed gtk+10, is this the most recent version?

Does the glib package allow the gtk stuff to link properly providing
the gtk-config tool to link the libraries in?  Can all versions of
gtk be installed together?  What reason would there be to have an
older version of gtk around and how would you select a specific
version at compile time?

I have a question about your .0098% figure.

Have you actually reduced the amount of spam being delivered to your 
account, or are you simply not seeing it (i.e. it's getting classified 
as spam and shunted elsewhere)?

Subject: [PLUG] Using a hard disk with single bad sector.
Message-ID: <1062975470.16730.7.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have a large 30 gig hard drive that has one bad sector which I want to
use for an experiment.  I'm assuming the Redhat 7.3 installer is
crashing because of this sector.  I've isolated the sector to be
somewhere on the last gig of the drive.  I'm trying to adjust some 
fat32 partitions using ranish to get a tight fit around it, though 
this is not proving easy.  The idea is to get a 10 gig parition 
around it and then use Linux fdisk to figure out what the area of 
the disk has the trouble sector as close as possible.  I figure I
can simply leave a hole between partitions in that area of the 
disk.

Is there an easier way to get the absolute location of the trouble spot?
I'm surprised that hard drives can't compensate for a single bad sector
by remapping all the sectors after it so that it essentially drops out
of the sector list.

Another hard drive from the same era has completely failed, maybe 
I am getting there on this one too.

Those stats, as I described in the last message, are what is actually

Message-ID: <1062979090.17357.9.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have a masquerading router right now and what I'd like 
to do is selectively, when I'm running Windows on my own 
computer, deny Internet browsing.  Can I do this with 
ZoneAlarm?  Anyone know of a slick trick if I have to do 
this on the Linux server end?  For one thing, this 
feature is something I want to give the end user the 
authority to engage/disengage.

I'm surprised ZoneAlarm doesn't have an option to deny
sending out anything that's destined for any net other
than the local one.  It seems like ZoneAlarm assumes
that interfaces are either local or not, but this is 
not accurate at all in a masquerading environment.

Subject: [PLUG] Masquerading question...
Message-ID: <1062983160.17357.50.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

If I want to disable a host's Internet access when it may be 
receiving data from a masquearading server, will the masq 
server terminate connections with Internet hosts because it 
can't send data to the local host anymore or does the local 
host have to terminate those connections?  I would think 
since the masq box pretends to be the local host that it 
should simulate being down when the local host is down and 
terminate any data stream destined to that host.

Out of curiosity, is there a port of iptables for Windows 98 
Second Edition?  I want to use it to set up rules that drop 
all packets outbound to the Internet and inbound from it on 
individual workstations at will.  

Ultimately, I guess the simple masquerade for any local address 
rule has to be replaced with something more complex like a user 
defined chain for each host that the appropriate masquerading 
rule can be put into and flushed out of at will.  There are hosts 
that should be allowed to traverse the local network prevented
from getting past the gateway and receiving data from the 
Net when a user wants or needs this.  This is something where
a utility would be well placed on my private internal web 
server, perhaps a CGI script.  The alternative to CGI is
an X terminal based utility.  This has the advantage that
people have to authenticate by logging in on a local Linux 
server before they can change their Internet access setting.

As this is a Linux user group, I'm not sure how much response you'll get
asking about Windows products. However, I will say this:

if the masquerading server is running linux and is running a standard
firewall based on iptables, iptables can easily do this. The firewall
may or may not have settings for it, but should be modifiable to do
this. Add webmin and you can allow the user to do this, if they are
allowed access to configuring the firewall, which is probably a bad
idea. Otherwise, you can write a simple cgi script, make it available
internally only on the firewall, and have it dynamically add or subtract
a preset iptables rule (do not allow it to take user input regarding the
rule, or you have one hell of a security breach).

So basically this is a religious comamndment, as it is clearly rooted in
a particular set of religious philosophies. 

"Consequently, to immanentize the eschaton is to commit a basic error in
self-understanding. It is to assume wrongly that human aspiration and
destiny are coterminous with the natural world. It is to assume wrongly
that metaphysical questions, which are life?s core questions, either do
not exist at all, or can be rationally investigated only through the
methods of physics, which in practice tends to be another way of
defining such questions as unanswerable and therefore irrelevant. In
sum, to immanentize the eschaton is to assume wrongly that ultimate
reality, of which God is the final measure, is instead some form of
this-world reality, of which man is presumed to be the final measure."

Of course this paragraph assumes a number of facts, that would could
reasonably debate. :)

Does ZA still have the big red STOP button on it?  I thought that's what
that did.

Alternatively, you could probably just have the Windows lusers set their
default gw to 127.0.0.1.  If Win9x, you'd have to reboot, I think...
otherwise, you'd be good to go.

Although I really like that CGI script idea suggested by the other
guy... sounds way cool to me.  :-)

The command ``mkfs -c" will remap bad sectors. So will the related
commands for other file systems. Check the man pages.

Modern hard drives do automatically map out bad sectors. The fact that you
see a bad sector means it has already delt with a large number of them and
is on a downward spiral toward total failure. I wouldn't use the hard drive!
It is running on borrowed time.

Are the ports closed, or open?  If they're closed, and you want to open
some sort of pipe to see what the connecting protocol might be, 'nc'
will let you do this.  If the ports are open, then 'tcpdump' or another
of other sniffers will let trace the traffic.  My preferred way of using
it is to run tcpdump with the '-w' option to dump the packets to a file
and then copy the file to my workstation and analyze it with Ethereal.

All of these applications run on both Linux and OpenBSD.

If you don't want to capture, just look, try iptraf.  I use it for
continuous monitoring, no x-server needed.

Not always.  Modern drives will automatically map out sectors that they can
recover the data from.  Once the sector read fails to recover the data, the
drive
will not do anything with it, leaving that up to the user/host operating
system.

Sometimes that bad sector is the result of a incompleted write.  No amount
of
reading will recover the sector but by re-writing the block, all is well
and good.

Best bet for checking whither the drive is in the process of dying is to
check
the smart attributes values and compare these to the threshold values.  If
the
values are close ( they are clocked down toward the thresholds) then it's
time
to backup and replace.

(Plug for Plug Advanced Topics Meeting; I'll explain what smart is and why
you
 should be paying attention to it. Sept 17)

What is the most common cause of hard drive failure?  I had a 
fujitsu drive from the same period as this one that is supposed 
to have a higher MTBF than an IBM deskstar, but the fujitsu 
failed first.  One guess I have is that fujitsu got booted 
more often.  When it failed it just disappeared.  I opened 
it up to look at it but there is nothing obvious inside.  
What do you have to do to manually erase a hard disk beyond 
the point where anyone can recover data off of it short of 
sending it to a trusted recycling shop?

I've heard that hard disks have aluminum platters with something
sprayed on them that's magnetic.  As far as bad sectors, are they
mostly caused by spikes in power to the drive head or does the
magnetic material deform beyond manipulation by the head after 
a while?  Is exposing the platters to the air enough to permanently
prevent anyone from getting remnants of the data that was on it?

I think it's because inetd doesn't have any throttling capability.
Something about stampede, inetd not doing well in situations
where a herd requests service all at once.  I also 
believe that xinetd is considered cleaner because services
can be put into their own files and the functionality of
tcp_wrappers is part of xinetd.

One problem I have with xinetd is not knowing the syntax so
that I can write control files for certain services.  In the
inetd days most everything was there and you just uncommented
a service to enable it.

I believe xinetd has traffic shaping functionality that inetd
does not have.  Something in the howto about inetd becoming
unreliable under heavy load was under the xinetd HOWTO if
I remember correctly.

inetd handles starting servers, basically.... why wouldn't you want to
run it?  :-)

I run it on two of my boxes, the third I don't have any services enabled
except for sshd on.

Are you thinking of ident?

Michael,

  According to the notice from the Slackware security e-mail I received
(which prompted my question), inetd would shut down if 250 requests came in
over a short period of time. And, it would remain shut down for 10 minutes.
So, a DoS could be effective by sending a very few packets every 10 minutes
and keeping 'Net services shut off.

  It may be that xinetd avoids the problem.

  But, neither appear to be required so why run them anyway?

Thanks,

Rich

For some services it isn't a bad idea, usually this is referring to
services that are not accessed very often.  However, for services that
need to be stopped at will, or that get lots of requests, running as a
stand alone deamon is much more manageable.  Examples of these are
Apache, Samba and ftp.  

I hope that answers your question.

Try a quick read through this PDF from the fine folks at Seagate:

http://www.seagate.com/content/docs/pdf/whitepaper/D2c_More_than_Interface_ATA_vs_SCSI_042003.pdf

My take on the most common causes of hard drive failure are:
  + heat
  + failed spindle motor bearings
  + power surge/lag damage
  + vibration (often temporary "failure")

> When it failed it just disappeared.

Sounds like the electronics/controller died if you couldn't even get the
drive to identify itself.

One note on MTBFs-- in order to compare them you'll need to know the
assumptions made by each manufacturer with regard to the test
environment.  Were the drives on continually?  Were they only on 8
hours/day?  Was there a single power on per day or multiple?  What was the
ambient temperature kept at?  Etc. etc.

> I opened it up to look at it but there is nothing obvious inside.  

My guess is that the insides were probably completely functional when you
opened it.  Neat stuff in there, eh?

Writing once to each sector on the filesystem is enough to deter anyone
without access to a data recovery shop.  This is obviously hard to do if
the drive is inaccessible.

After that you'll simply need to weigh your paranoia vs. the time and
effort you want to spend.  For the truly paranoid, converting the entire
drive to plasma and dispersing it slowly into the atmosphere at high speed
and high altitude is probably sufficient.

Glass was a more common substrate as of 2001.  It's smoother than
aluminum.  Manufacturers may well be on to something new now.

You're right about the thin layer of depositted magnetic material though.

Hard drives use complex algorithms that extract a tiny signal from the
background noise.  The denser you pack the bits, the closer the signal
gets to the noise.  (And there is a strong financial motivation to pack
the bits as close as possible.)

If the magnetic properties of a microscopic magnetic domain change
slightly over time due to heating/cooling, oxidation, etc. the noise may
eventually engulf the signal.

Severe shock to the drive can also result in head/platter contact which
vaporizes some of the material from the surface and exposes nearby areas
to extremely high heat.  (Think of what your Dremel at 15,000 RPMs does to
what it touches.)  This alters the magnetic properties of a large area of
the surface and can easily create sudden nonrecoverable failures.

In modern drives, the slow creep of heat + oxidation happens so often that
when the algorithm can't cope with the change any more, and the logic in
the sector headers can't cope with the change any more that sector gets
remapped transparently to the host controller.  Note the key is that this
happens slowly-- the drive itself is aware that it can't read this area as
well as it used to before the area becomes completely unreadable.  (This
is where SMART comes in-- providing this information back to the host
controller.)

The magnetic material itself does not "wear out" from being magnetized.

Anyone?  Nope.  Most folks?  Yep.

I find exposing the platters to a 3 pound sledge helps prevent even more
folks from getting remnants of the original data.  Microwaving is also
fun, though I usually reserve that fate for my CD-R media.

You don't need them if you don't need to launch daemons on

Failures: Head/media interface: mechanical shock and particle
contamination.
Boards: mechanical shock and vibration, electrical shock (static).

The Fujitsu problem I'll refer you here:
http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/28384.html
as I cannot publicly comment on it.  If you bought it directly from
us or a distributor and it's in warranty, we will replace it.

If it functions then a format (low level or interface level) followed
by random data write to the full surface (raw device, no filesystem) or
two full surface random data writes.

Non-function. Disassembly and use a magnet, the one from the actuator
will do nicely, if you can get it apart (watch you fingers).

Yes most platters are aluminum with multiple layers of magnetic
material.

A large percentage of failures we see are interrupted writes (most
of our customers use MS).  A lockup while trying to write followed by
the power switch or hard reset can cause this problem.

The ability for the magnetic material to record data is only effected by
heat or in the case of platters the lack of magnetic material cause by
the heads hitting the disk.

>Is exposing the platters to the air enough to permanently
>prevent anyone from getting remnants of the data that was on it?

No there is air in the drive and it is recirculated from the outside
through a breather hole (filtered).

Good idea.

[root at adnap root]# apt-get php
E: Invalid operation php
[root at adnap root]# apt-get install php
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
php is already the newest version.
0 packages upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 removed and 10 not upgraded.
[root at adnap root]#

Not so good execution :-/

So I looked at the manpage, and tried this:

[root at adnap root]# apt-get install php=4.3.2-7
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
E: Version '4.3.2-7' for 'php' was not found
[root at adnap root]# apt-get install php=4.3.2

Building Dependency Tree... Done
E: Version '4.3.2' for 'php' was not found
[root at adnap root]# apt-get install php=4.3
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
E: Version '4.3' for 'php' was not found
[root at adnap root]#

No luck with that either.  I'm looking at 'dist-upgrade' in the 
manpages.  Is that what I need to try next?

I'm new to apt, so don't hesitate to point out the obvious.

Thanks,
Evan

Put the first CD in the CDROM drive and rebooted... 

After getting the initial option screen (enter to install or upgrade) it

My sources seem to be in /etc/apt/sources.list.  The only sources not 
commented out are these:

# Red Hat Linux 7.3
rpm http://ayo.freshrpms.net redhat/7.3/i386 os updates freshrpms
rpm-src http://ayo.freshrpms.net redhat/7.3/i386 os updates freshrpms

There are a lot just like those for redhat 8.0, redhat 9, etc, but they 
are commented out.

http://freshrpms.net/packages/builds/index.html?build=apt is a copy of 
the same sources.list file that I have.

If the installer is similiar to Red Hat's, you can alt-f1..f5 to one of the 
multiple terminals that are used for output and gather evidence.  Of course, 
the process has to get as far as launching those terms to be of any help.

You would need to find a repository containing the new version.  The 
default /etc/apt/sources.list contains the RedHat 7.3 distribution and 
updates.  That has an older version.  There are some good apt-enabled 
repositories out there but none of them contain php.

Did you try looking on rpm.pbone.net and rpmfind.net?  A brief search 
showed a couple of packages for RH8 and 9.  The package you had before 
looked like it was built against one of those.  Getting all the 
dependencies to install will be equivalent to upgrading the machine to 
RH 8/9.  I did see a php-4.3.1-1 in the RedHat contrib section that 
looks like it is compatible with RH 7.3.  Using that as a basis for 
building 4.3.2 or 4.3.3 may work well.

Oh, I did have to replace the first fujitsu drive I got.  The
replacement that failed lasted quite a while.  Is it true that
Fujitsu America is out of business?  

What's the deal with IBM getting out of the drive business?  
Who is buying out Seagate?  Some say high quality hard drives, 
used to be IBM and Fujitsu, don't sell well because few realize 
that the price is well worth paying.  If a cheap component 
fails prematurely, your not really saving any money.  

It's said that backup is essential for data on hard disk, but 
there's hardly anything out there now that writes more than 
once capable of holding as much as today's hard drives.  
Try buying a tape drive these days, if your an average 
user you'll probably think $1000 is too much where that's
a low estimate.  I've yet to see anyone for example sell a 
200 gig tape system at a reasonable price, there are hard
disks this big and larger already though.

I suppose anymore one has to hope any data they need to
keep fits on a CD.

One thought is raid boxes.  The drives probably destroy
each other though because of the amount of vibration.

Who is making hard drives these days?  How many companies are
competing with so many brands disappearing?

google "ibm deathstar" you will find many happy people and great stories.

I like western digital's 3 year warranty 8mb buffer drives, and I've never
had to rma one. Good for heat too.
I've rma'd two maxtors, but I noticed the ticking and got my data off first,
and the turnaround was quick - both drives were the 2mb pos "guaranteed not
to break until 1 year is up" editions, so I kind of deserve it. I don't
think they have many quality controls on the 1yr/2mb cheapo drives - and I
think this is not isolated to a single manufacturer - I've gotten cheapo
drives that came with damaged ide cables inside the shrink wrapped box
/shrug.

Of course, the techs never want to rma a drive with occasional ticking, etc,
so I keep an old 4.5 gb 7200 rpm seagate baracuda that screams so loud you
can hear it 40 feet away handy - just stick that to the phone and instant
rma >;)
The above smiley looks like terrance and phillip, so I must be a bit tired.

Subject: [PLUG] GRUB: Error 21 during stage 1.5
Message-ID: <1063115943.1300.10.camel@elix>

Hi All,

I got this problem after I installed XP over an existing Linux + 2K
system. The partition table looks like this:

/dev/hde1             1      1024   8225248+   7  HPFS/NTFS
/dev/hde2   *      1025      2554  12289725    7  HPFS/NTFS
/dev/hde3          2555      2626    578340   82  Linux swap
/dev/hde4          2627      7297  37519807+   f  Win95 Ext'd (LBA)
/dev/hde5          2627      5813  25599546   83  Linux

After the XP install I couldn't boot to Linux anymore, so i used a
floppy to boot to linux and installed grub, but then I get the Error 21
during Stage 1.5 load. Error 21 means "disk not found" according to the
grub manual, but it worked well before, so I'm not sure if this is
correct. I was able to install grub on a floppy and everything works
well from there - I can boot to Linux/2k/XP without problems.

Any ideas are welcome,

Emil

No, Fujitsu America is still in business.  Disk drives are
made by Fujitsu LTD and sold by Fujitsu Computer products of America
here in the US.

Fujitsu did stop playing in the cut-throat desktop market where
gross margins on these products have dropped down to the commodity level


>What's the deal with IBM getting out of the drive business?

IBM didn't fell it was profitable anymore and didn't see a long
term future.  They thought that Moore's law was going to run head
long into the wall for Disk drives.

>Who is buying out Seagate?

Seagate bought out Seagate.  They went public at some time in the
past but have now gone back private.

Tape market is a slow trend follower as it is geared toward
businesses.  They are working toward 8 terabyte cartridge
capacity.

Looks like the DVD writers are starting to push the price down
to make these the new backup medium.

Not most of the time because they are normally isolated.  The
one thing most people didn't realize about raid is you buy all
the same drive (manufacturer,capacity, manufacture date) and
any failure you get is multiplied across the raid.  They could all
fail within days if it is a manufacturing defect or lot code material
problem.

>Who is making hard drives these days?  How many companies are
>competing with so many brands disappearing?

Hitachi www.hgst.com     Took over all of IBM's manufacturing sites.
Fujitsu www.fujitsu.com  Left desktop market in Sept 2001.
Maxtor  www.maxtor.com   Took over Quantum disk drives.  Quantum focusing
on tape.
NEC     www.nec.com      Mostly Japan domestic.

I made the mistake of calling them burned when I emailed their customer
service about some super-late CDs I ordered a few years back...

They were very quick to point out their CDs are pressed, *not* burned.

Mutt is also a non-broken MUA, but is CLI rather than GUI. And I like
it much. It can launch either urlView or lynx to see HTML mail with an
edit to the .muttrc file (uncomment some lines).

Kmail does a pretty good job too.  I especially like that
I can tell it to use $my_editor as your default editor.

Phil,

  No, I've not seen that one. But now and then -- _very_ infrequently -- I
have a printing problem with CUPS. Stopping and restarting cupsd almost
always helps. When it doesn't, I check the process list and discover that
something's stuck on the parallel port and holding it hostage. Killing the
process for lp0 clears up the problem. Of course, it usually takes me a
half-hour or more to think of checking the port. :-)

I'm a Linux neophyte living in the "thriving metropolis" of Donald, OR & 
who just bought Mandrake 9.1.  I'd previously used PartitionMagic 7.0 to 
create 2 partitions for Linux (L: = Ext2 of 2.416GB & M: = Swap File of 
305.9MB).  These 2 partitions are on their own hdd. with another 2+GB of 
the Logical partition still unused.

While installing from the 2 CD's, my mouse died.  This happened after 
the manual configure screen where I set my monitor resolution & printer 
configuration correction.  I was trying to configure my sound card when 
I evidently hit the mouse button too quick... (the Hourglass mouse icon 
was visible a long time & I couldn't hear nor see any hdd nor screen 
activity... it was like the system had hung).  Since the "3-finger 
salute" didn't work, I hit the power switch.  Upon restarting, the 
system went straight to Win2k.  I don't know how to get to the Linux 
user environment.  I assume there's still some configuration needed as I 
would think boot-up would present me with a menu from which to choose 
the OS I want to use... but that's not happening.

Win2k Pro OS = C: drive, Applications = D: drive, & Data = E: drive on 
PII 300MHz SuperMicro MBd, printer = HP 693C, mouse = MS PS/2 
wheelmouse, Kbd. = 108 key windows, video card = Diamond Fire GL1000 
Pro, monitor = Viewsonic P810-3, soundcard = Creative AWE64 16-bit, 
Network card = D-Link DFE-530TX PCI Fast Ethernet, plugged into 
SMC7004ABR Barricade Router, plugged into a Motorola SB4101 Surfboard 
cable Modem.  My wife's computer is on the Lan, also, but only running 
Win2k Pro, for now.

As usual, I thought I could do it alone... but not so.  I'd very much 
like to not have to wait until Sep. 20th for the Linux Clinic to get 
Linux up & running as all our (read the wife's) expenses are continually 
needing entry.  Yes the data is backed-up.

My end objective is to be weaned off MS's $$$ path & wholly onto Linux. 
 I'm now Retarded (as my brother-in-law calls it) & on fixed income so 
can't afford lots of s/w to update.  Any help you, or someone you know, 
can offer would be very greatly appreciated.  I also have a telephone 
within reach while at my computer.

Thank you for your consideration in this matter.
Dave

In this case cupsd never gets started.  when I try to run the 
/etc/init.d/cupsd start  I get the message I mentioned above about the 
signal 11 business.

In this case the printer is on a different machine on the network.  cups 
was working fine for me in Mandrake 9.0 with this configuration.  Now 
cupsd won't even start.  I found some posts to a german newsgroup where 
someone was having the same problem, but it doesn't look like there were 
any answers to the query.

I liked Kmail just fine except that it would put sent mail into an IMAP

Given that this problem occurred after a software upgrade, it's unlikely
that this is a memory problem.  Nonetheless, I'd try running memtest86
just to be sure your machine is working properly.

I just downgraded to the older cups rpms from Mandrake 9.0 - now at least 
cupsd starts and I can see stuff in the queue.  Still not getting any 
printouts, but I suspect it's 
something to do with shorewall.  Last night I downgraded shorewall to get 
it working right again (obviously there's still some configuration to be 
done, but I wasn't getting anywhere at all with the shorewall that came 
with 9.1).  I also have had a lot of trouble with the 2.4.21-mdk kernel 
that comes with Mandrake 9.1 - My machine would seize up when trying to access 
the CDROM for example - so I went back to the 2.4.19-mdk kernel that came 
with 9.0....  I'm beginning to wonder why I bothered to upgrade, it seems 
to have been a total waste of time.

Since Mandrake & Red Hat are supposedly similiar, my guess is that the 
installer waits to the very end to write to the mbr and set up the 
bootloader.  This happened to me the other day when installing RH 8.0 (bad 
media).

I usually skip setting up X and sound until the OS is up and running.  Too 
many times the installer barfs on those two things and you need to 
reinstall.  Suspect that's what you'll have to do as well.

I can check when I get home, (here at work on Solaris I use mutt.)

How exactly would I tell the format?

There is already a plug-in to do this.  Check the plug-in sites; I
forget what it's called.

It's called Electrix, and I'll let you know how it works.

Colin,

  O'Reilly has a book out on programming mozilla. According to the LJ
review, it's more of a reference than a HOWTO, but it may help you.

What I mean to say was Kmail wouldn't save sent email to an IMAP folder.
The folder choices were limited to local folders. I was just checking to
see if you knew if that feature was added.

I have been working with 9.1 for a while and have not had any problems
with cops - as long as I did not try to run in msec modes 5.

I did find a post where someone had an error 11 when upgrading to 9.0 -
the fix was to remove cups rpms and then delete the configuration files,
then install them again. 

If you have problems with shorewall - dump the Mandrake utils and use
Webmin to control it, much easier to use.

I have Mandrake 9.0 installed, even if it's not the
distribution I spend most of my time with. I'll take
this as a recommendation not to upgrade until such
problems are fixed.

Same here. I have had plenty of problems setting up GUI preferences,
and other cute/useful widgets that sometimes lockup the GUI. So, I
always install to NOT launch X on startup. I have it boot to a
console, and then once I have a working system, I can put "startx" in
the ".bash_profile". Then, if something in the X bails, I can use
"ctl-alt-F7" to exit X and be back to the command line. If X won't
exit that way, I can usually use "ctl-alt-F2" to get to another
console login prompt where I can login and kill the X system to
recover without rebooting.

BTW -- has Donald grown recently? At my last visit, they had a diner
and a stop sign.... I used to live in Aurora (about 15 years ago).

I'm trying to set up masquerading / nat with iptables.

I downloaded a simple firewall script to get me started.  The last line of 
the script does:

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE

However, this returns:
iptables: Invalid argument

if I remove the '-j MASQUERADE' part of the command, like so:

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0

it's fine, but of course that does nothing....

Any idea why it doesn't like: '-j MASQUERADE'?

Looks like the nat module is not auto-loading.

Try adding this to the top of your script:

	modprobe iptable_nat

Did you try '-j MASQ'? That's used in the iptables man page in one
spot.

Turns out the problem was because I was booting up an older kernel 
(2.4.19mdk) instead of 2.4.21 (the one that came with Mandrake 9.1) 
because the laterr kernel was causing the machine to hang when accessing 
the CDROM.  Now that I've tried it with the 2.4.21 kernel I don't get the 
Invalid argument message.  Must be that the wrong modules were being 
loaded.

I take it then you're actually running Eclipse... Lots of people are
raving about it, but I started to look at it and it seemed to be 100+ MB
download and there seemed to be some other stuff I wasn't ready to deal
with (maybe the lack of a spec file was one of them).  So is it really
good?  How is it for Perl and Python development?  Can you give us a 3
minute report on it?

Not really -- I've done little more than make sure it runs correctly,
finds all its resource files, works well with various Java VMs -- but
some folks at OGI seem to like it. That's why I built the spec, so I
can install it more easily on a number of Linux clients.

I'm hoping to move a perl script or two into a workspace and give it a
spin, but I just haven't had time, so the three-minute report probably
won't happen any time soon. :-(

Wil,

  I'm just beginning to use it for java development of a very large project.
It came very highly recommended to me. It is large (rather slow on my
PII/333 MHz system) but it gets things done. I was told by Nathan Meyers
(some of you may remember him) that Eclipse was what took him away from vi
(or was it emacs?) to a GUI tool for writing all his java code. As far as
I'm concerned, there's no higher praise.

  If you want to go one step further, download the community (i.e., free)
edition of Posidon-for-UML. It's a terrific UML tool and will output code in
several languages. I know it does java and the java fits right in to
Eclipse.

  Wil, I think your looking for EPIC, the "Eclipse Perl Integration"
project.

  I've been looking at it, but haven't had time to download.  It has pretty

Yes, previewing a message is equivalent to opening it, AFAIK.  But
there's no actual "interesting" code in the message you forwarded--it's
just some HTML with spammy comments.  I don't find anything on the
Sophos site about it being either a hoax or anything else; it's either
very new or just a one-off prank.

And by the way, if you genuinely think it's dangerous, doesn't it seem
like a really dumb idea to forward it to a mailing list?

It's a hoax: http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/got.you.hoax.html

Previewing isn't "exactly" the same as opening.

There are some virii that run on preview, and there are some that run on 
opening. Still others, you have to open an attachment to actually 
activate the virus.

I don't think this one can even hurt LookOut users.  The phone number
looks like the most dangerous part, it dials the Dominican Republic,
where they can charge just about anything they want for the phone time
and the phone company will automatically bill you.

That's why I didn't forward the actual message.  I copied the source 
of the email into a text file.  Last time I checked, text files are
viewed as plain text.
  
By making the suspicious email an attachment, it doesn't automatically
open.  Saving it as text, Windows won't even render it as html.  My
understanding is that attachments have to be opened to be dangerous. 
There isn't any Linux email program that will do that without a user
request, is there?  I did indicate that the attachment is the code of
this suspicious thing.  Surely no program will execute a text file.

What can I do in the future if I want to send a suspicious email
somewhere to be evaluated safely?  Good thing it's a hoax as it
couldn't have infected anyone anyways.  I really didn't think 
the way I packaged it that it could infect easily even if it 
was a real worm.  

It's the body of the message that outlook for example will 
execute, unless there was a command in that body to open the 
attachment as well, which there isn't.  I should point out 
that only the read bits are set on the attachment.  I 
sent it from a Linux machine allowing me to take this
precaution.

Had this suspicious thing been a binary, I wouldn't have 
forwarded it in any form.

When I opened the attachment with Opera/Win98, it decided to render the HTML. 

I had to tell it to view the source to see the code. That was scary until I read 
it. It was definitely a txt file before opening. 

As fara as I'm concerned, it's broken behavior for a client to decide what an 
attachment is, ignoring it's extension.

Well, Evolution displayed it as an e-mail message with HTML; but its
HTML rendering is pretty safe--it doesn't do JavaScript at all and
doesn't automatically load remote images.  It didn't open it
automatically, of course--I opened it because I wasn't worried about
being affected by it.  Still, it's not a good idea to send these around.

I'd put it on web server somewhere, optionally protected with a password
that you just send to the list.

AFAIK, for Outlook and Outlook Express, previewing and viewing of
messages are handled by the same IE control -- there's literally no
difference, just different window dressing.  It's very different for
messages whose attack is triggered by attachment execution, but that's
another issue.

How is a daemon running all the time better than inetd or xinetd
launching a daemon on demand?  Wouldn't it make sense to have inetd
listen for services you offer when requests are very low and then
switch to a daemon when requests go up?  Potentially I see 
lightening up the number of daemons through inetd and xinetd 
which could improve performance.  The other thing is, doesn't
xinetd give a wrapper for controlling who can access a service
and at what rate which is more standard and easier to understand 
than each individual daemon that can be used instead?

Then you wouldn't have to strip out the juicy parts.  The one I got had
some very strange code and a huge amount of nonsense commenting that is
missing from the text file.

Yes, [x]inetd-style daemons are a bit easier to implement, because you
can rely on the super-server to manage access controls, forking, socket
handling, etc.  I've written shell-based HTTP servers with no task other
than sending a redirect message to another port (where a real HTTP
server was listening).  But for daemons that have fairly slow start-up
times, the overhead is too much.  And really, memory isn't so tight
these days, so a few extra MBs doesn't make that much of a difference. 
I doubt you'd see much of an improvement in any machine with more than
64MB of memory.

The message contained plain HTML which can't contain a worm because it
is only parsed and rendered but not executed. If there is no JavaScript
or other script or macro there is also no threat to text based
documents.

I read something on google that the company makes it's own 
motherboards from older technology because that fits their 
needs better.  If I understand Moore's law correctly, it's a 
theory that computing power will constantly increase through 
advances in IC manufacturing techniques.  It is evidently 
based on the idea that more and more demanding computer 
applications will feed investment into ever more expensive 
chip manufacturer processes,  whether that be .25 micron 
technology, .18 micron technology, etc.  One thing I came 
across that doesn't make sense is why it "always" costs
more to build a plant that produces the smallest possible 
IC's than it did to build one even a year earlier.  Not 
only that, one site suggested that the price is double or 
worse for the current generation plants than it is for the 
plants from the immediately preceeding generation.

What is considered profitable anyways?  Has trying to develop 
things quickly instead of fully hurt Intel and other companies 
in the PC business the most?

I think PC hardware manufacturers are intent on discontinuing
products ASAP so that people will be forced into newer stuff,
whether they need it or not.  I'd like to hear companies like
Intel, IBM, Sun, HP, etc. talk about what high tech is going
to be in the future without the funerals I've seemingly been
running into.  So people don't get to be million dollar 
wonders after one year in industry.  Who said that was ever
correct anyways?  I think the political pressure of 
monopolies on the industry is what's challenging Moore's
law more than anything.  Like many, I'm worried about
Computer Science and other related fields, especially
because of the scare talk that is going on in our post 
dot bust world.

I read somewhere that Moore thinks the post dot com computer
industry will be strong, but unprofitable.  Why would any of us
have to accept that?  I think there's plenty to do.

I hadn't know that -- though it wouldn't have made any difference.
It a) is not supported by Red Hat, b) requires a truck load of
nonstandard packages to make it work, and c) is Eclipse version 2.1,
whereas my folks wanted the relatively stable 3.0 milestone.

That said, it's a neat project. I hope that the gcc and Eclipse folks
find the Red Hat patches to their liking so that eclipse needn't rely
on a JVM.

Actually it was for da.haole.boy, but I now realize that his message
was forwarded to the list. Donald, OR is a few miles due west of
Aurora, near the Champoeg Park exit I think. IIRC 'main street' goes
under I-5 about 100 yards or so from the stop sign, but there's no
exit direct to the wide spot; you have to wander around abit first.

It was my understanding that the preview pane (pain?) does NOT behave 
the same as when you "open" a message.

1. I don't need inetd/xinetd access control mechanisms when I
   have better control at my firewall(s) and DNS server.

2. I don't run insecure daemons, like telnet, that typically
   are launched by inetd/xinetd. I use things like sshd, which are
   always running.

3. The daemons that I'd launch from inetd/xinetd are not that big.
   Memory is no longer a precious resource.

4. inetd does have some problems and I don't like the silly syntax
   of the xinetd configuration files - especially the disable=yes
   nonsense. If I wanted to launch daemons on demand I'd use
   Bernstein's tools.

This quote underlines the fact that the preview does the same as opening
the message.

As does this quote from your source:

Ewww, look what you stepped in. :-) X resource files are incredibly
opaque. Try this:

  egrep -isr 'xdefaults|xresources' /etc/*

That'll at least tell you what files will (and won't, as is the case
of Xfce) be using the user's and/or system-wide resource files.

There are a number of man pages that mention the files in question:
X(7x), xrdb(1), xinit(1), and xdm(1).

If you're using xfce4, then your .Xdefaults file isn't being read at
all. You'll have to invoke it yourself once per session, e.g.,

  xrdb ~/.Xdefaults

I believe .Xdefaults is depreciated in favor of .Xresources.  At least one 
can be a symlink to the other.

There is a tool (I can't remember the name) that will you use to click on 
parts of a running X app and it will spit out the property so you can stick 
it in your .Xresources.

I know with xfig you can specify the initail window size on startup:
from http://www.xfig.org/userman/options.html#com-sizes

-geometry [WxH]+x+y (-geom)
     Set the size and/or position of the xfig window. You may use this to 
set the size of the main xfig window, or you may instead set the size of the 
drawing canvas in inches or cm using the -pwidth and -pheight options.

That's it.  On second thought, this might not do what I claimed.  Never

I've been watching plug-jobs, but unfortunately I get things like
5+ years experience required, etc., etc.  I need something to give
me the first year of experience and while I'm on the subject, I 
want the freedom to continue working on a B.S. concurrently also.  
I'm torn between going the stop and get some money route verses 
trying to work around Thursday all day, Friday all day, Monday 
night starting about 4 pm, Wendsday Night same as Monday, and 
Sunday morning.  

So far I've been told I can't work with limitations on 
working hours at Fred Meyers.  This only asking for half 
of Sunday off which I absolutely have to have.  Considering 
I have an associates degree, I'm wondering where to find 
that part time job that will work.  I'm starting to wonder
how best to look for it.  I'm tempted to borrow the
money I need to go to Oregon State as I believe I'll 
have a better chance of landing a part time job worked 
around school there.  Not only that, I'm thinking there's
a chance of getting a job that will help me graduate
by being computer related in Corvallis.

You are misreading the quote.

Microsoft was saying that reading the message in the preview pane or 
auto-preview is safe, as opposed to reading it by opening the message.

Your quote is supposition. Key words being, "I'll bet..."

  Does anyone know how to change the PostScript file so it prints on
letter-size paper rather than the European A4-size paper?

  I see PageSize and SetPageSize in the ps file, but not any "A4" in the
right place. I suspect that the numbers after SetPageSize are the key, but I
don't know what they should be for US Letter size.

  Son-of-a-gun! The first three times I read through the prolog I didn't see
it. Right after sending the message above, there it was:

595 842 /a4 setpagesize

  Changed the /a4 to /letter and she's printing as I write.

Sigh. Sorry to waste the bandwidth.

Kyle & Jeff, your re-install suggestion did the trick.  Being the 
"Chicken that I am", I put the boot loader on a floppy, though, for now. 
 I pretty much used a default install, except did manually get the Video 
card & monitor set correctly.  I put the boot loader on a floppy as I 
didn't know if it would cause a future problem (with it on the Win2k hhd 
or if Win2k would be accessible if it were on the Linux hhd.  Thank you 
both for your assistance.

Belarc's Advisor says my sound card is Creative's AWE64 16-bit Audio 
(SB16 compatible) with AWE64 Wavetable MIDI (AWE32 compatible).  I 
believe this is a PCI bus card, but the only options I saw when in the 
post install were ISA & something other than PCI (that dis ol' dog can't 
remember).  What need I do to configure this?

Respectfully, Dave

P.S.:  Donald's main street extends across I-5 elevated, rather than 
passing under it, about a mile south of the Aurora/Donald I-5 exit.  :-) 
 Feller Road is the one that passes under I-5.  The Donald Cafe is under 
different ownership, but still turns out a "country-sized" breakfast 
that keeps the house packed.  Never plan on a "quick" meal there...  :-) 
 but it is sumptuous!!!  Donald population EXCEEDs Aurora, now.  :-)

I don't think LyX will respond to settings in .X* files - editres reports
that LyX doesn't understand the right protocol.  But LyX does understand
the -geometry command line switch - you could use that as part of a
shortcut to fire up LyX, possibly?

So in ATA it takes fewer platters for higher capacity because of lower
rotational speeds allowing the use of thicker platters than in higher
performance drives.  Does the RPM contribute significantly to heat and
vibration sensitivity?  

If I want to raid 4 ATA disks together to take advantage of striping to
increase speed, can't I overcome heat and vibration problems by mounting
them significantly apart from each other in seperate racks or cages? 
I've seen IBM personal computers where the second hard drive mounts
about the power supply and the first mounts in a totally different
and distant location in the case.

If you build a raid over multiple machines the problem of being limited
to 2 to 4 drives becomes less significant, speed suffers though because
of low data transfer rates between machines.
One approach I could think of is to have multiple nics
between each box increasing inter machine throughput where
at $30 a card one time cost for a 100 mbps nic it seems fairly 
reasonably to increase the number of cards by 2. 
One gigabit card in each box in your raid cluster might 
be a better way to combat the bottleneck.

Try going to http://www.kernel.org and use official kernel source
instead of Mandrake source.  One thing to try is to compile a kernel 
from kernel.org sources, then test it by setting it up as a
second boot option by putting it on a disk or adding it lilo/grub.
I don't use redhat source on my redhat systems except in some cases
the original kernel, it seems to me that things just work better
when you don't use vendor kernel sources.  If you look under /boot,
at least on Redhat, you'll find a file name config-x.y.z.  If this
is copied to /usr/src/linux/.config, assuming that's the redhat 
kernel source, the options Redhat selected will be preselected 
and you can go through them deselecting whatever isn't right.  

I for one would like to know how to install the modules to /boot 
under whatever name I want to.  This is especially nice if you 
install multiple Linux systems to the same drive where difficulties 
can arise determining which root partition goes with which kernel.  
One trick I have done that's useful is copying lilo.conf to /boot.
I don't know what Redhat's common files all are that are under /boot
such as modules-conf.  It seems that System.map is regenerated
at each boot.  The latter creates a problem if you put a read only
directive in fstab for the boot partition as a security measure.
What is System.map for anyways?

I think I was told it's for debugging stuff.. something about knowing
where to find symbols for this, that, or the other thing.

I stopped even caring about it (I don't think Gentoo even mentions it in
their installation instructions, but I could be mistaken) several months
back and haven't had any problems as a result.

I wish Red Hat would drag its sound config tool into this century.  It's not 
rocket science from a programmatic point-of-view and would make everyone so 
freaking happy.

Try this,
$ lspci

you might see something like this,
02:0a.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Live! EMU10k1 (rev 0a)

so try, (as root)
	# modprobe emu10k1

if there are no complaints, that should have loaded the emu10k1 module plus 
the ones it relies on.  To confirm, list the loaded modules,
	$ lsmod

and look for a chain like this,
emu10k1                64320   2 (autoclean)
ac97_codec             13248   0 (autoclean) [emu10k1]
sound                  71532   0 (autoclean) [emu10k1]
soundcore               6468   7 (autoclean) [emu10k1 sound]

Now cd /usr/share/sounds and type ls, pick a .wav file that looks good and type
	$ play phone.wav

or whatever.

If all this worked, you're happy and all you need to do is add this line to 
your /etc/modules.conf
	alias sound-slot-0 emu10k1

If something along the way choked, let us know and we'll go from there.

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

What's an easy way to find out if xinetd is what's launching some
daemon?  Doesn't a lot of stuff depend on it in a number of Linux
distributions?  What's the rationale for supporting daemons on 
demand other than saving memory?  Why does one need bernstein's
tools if there's no for need xinetd?  Does qmail need the daemons 
on demand feature?  On a Redhat system, 7.x on up, isn't xinetd
connected to a number of packages?  

One problem with rpm is that erase doesn't always destroys 
the files that go with a package.  So short of doing an 
rpm -ql before uninstalling a package, one may not know 
what files are getting left behind.  I'm wondering if I
can and should remove xinetd.

rm -f `locate xinetd`

You could always use 'enable=no' instead :)

I didn't realize that would work - unless you're joking and
it can't be done. I decided early on that I didn't like
xinetd so I immediately looked for an alternative. Sometimes
abandoning software based on first impressions is the wrong
thing to do. I did that with grub early on and later found out
how powerful it is.

Look at the xinetd configuration files. If you want
to be certain that xinetd launched a currently running
daemon, I guess you could use ps and look at the parent
PID, though I've not done this yet.

Someone replied to this earlier - it's easier to develop
daemons that are launched by inetd/xinetd. Also, some
people might find the inetd/xinetd access controls easier
than learning how to configure their firewall or DNS.

> Why does one need bernstein's

I generally don't need to launch daemons on demand so I
don't normally use inetd, xinetd, or Bernstein's tools.
However, if i do need to launch daemons in demand I
prefer the Bernstein stuff.

No

I don't know about Red Hat 9, but with earlier versions,
the only thing enabled is FAM. There are numerous configuration
files in /etc/xinetd.d but most of those files have the
"disable=yes" statement, so they're not active.

Dunno. I don't usually do rpm.

It's been a long time since I used qmail. Is tcpserver

Message-ID: <E19xtvW-00028H-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

Hi.
At work, where I handle the firewall for the company, we have two locations connected by 
a "leased line" dsl; it's all one big unhappy network. Recently, I've been asked to provide 
info on "if we get a DSL for the other location, how do the computers know which "line" to 
go out"? In other words; they'll need to split the network up and add routing etc.

I'm more perplexed about how this is negotiated with the DSL "modems" involved. 
Currently on each end of the "leased line" we have a modem connected right into the 
network. My firewall has another ethernet card we're not using currently- I imagine that I'll 
be using it to connect to the other network. Do I (basically) connect the firewall to the 
"modem" to the "leased line"?

And this message
http://archive.lug.boulder.co.us/bymonth/1999.12/msg00164.html
implies that I'll need:on the routers / firewalls: external IP address, gateway for network A, 
gateway for network B so basically each side of the DSL line will have one IP address 
from each network.  

Actually, I take it back; using one router here with no firewall over there (and the DSL line 
plugging directly into the network over there) wouldn't bother me much; it's the 
connection between the routers that's confusing me. :)

Has anyone tried the ATi binary drivers? What is your impression? Fast?

[Daniel Petcher] 
Determining which directions the packets should go is the function of
your router. There are several different protocols with varying levels
of sophistication and ease-of-configuration that your routers will use
in order to communicate with each other. The simplest protocol is called
RIP - Routing Information Protocol, but you may wish to take advantage
of more complex protocols like OSPF - Open Shortest Path First. If
you're not buying new routers, the capabilities of your existing routers
will make this decision for you.

It will be easier to break the network into segments in order for each
office to prefer its own local Internet connection. You will need some
sort of a router (or a multihomed computer acting as a router) at each
office, and if you've got two windows to the Internet, you'll need two
firewalls to keep naughty folk from tossing a brick through those
windows.

This looks like the simplest configuration:

Internet ---- DSL Modem --- Firewall A ---- Router A --- Office 'A' LAN
                                              |
                                              |
                                              |
                                          DSL Modem
                                              |
                                              |
                                       Private Leased
                                        DSL circuit
                                              |
                                              |
                                          DSL Modem
                                              |
                                              |
                                              |
Internet ---- DSL Modem --- Firewall B ---- Router B --- Office 'B' LAN

Each office's router knows that traffic for the other office should go
over the private link and traffic for the Internet should go through the
firewall.

After you've established the simple scenario, you can optionally add
complexity: What if office A's Internet access goes down? It would be
good for the link to failover and pass Office A's Internet traffic
through the private link and out office B's Internet connection. It
should also work in the opposite direction. The routers should be
programmed to handle this for you. Further desirable complexity would be
to set-up an encrypted connection between the firewalls through the
Internet to allow inter-office communication if the leased circuit
should ever fail.

An additional layer of complexity would be load balancing. If one of the
direct routes is congested, it might be faster to take the alternate
route. Routers can be programmed to handle this for you as well.

You can be your company's own network engineer, but you'll need to do
some reading to get the needed skills. Alternately, you can hire a
consultant. I would recommend contacting a network engineer rather than
trying to learn to BE a network engineer while you're under the pressure
of having to make it all work. A beginner's mistake could endanger your
reputation and perhaps your job.

Three things I neglected to mention above:
-Breaking your network into segments will almost always require changing
the IP addresses of network nodes in one or both offices.
-If your ultimate concern is $$$, the firewall and router functions can
be combined in a Linux computer with three network cards. It takes very
little computing power to route packets.
-If security is your biggest concern, it would be best to separate the
routing and firewalling functions into different boxen.

What did they mean by "if we get a DSL for the other location"?  Another
leased line between the two locations?  Or an Internet connected DSL at
the other location?  Or, is there a third location that you want to
connect a leased line to?  What routes are they worried about?

Where is the other end of said DSL line?

I guess I don't understand what you network topology is and how you want
to change it.

Portsentry dutifully closed the connection and banned the offending system. I like portsentry.

The only problem is that the scanning machine was my ISP's name server, actually two of the name servers. 

Is there a vulnerability on this port? Is there a possibility that they've installed this software and let it 
try to index files on their subnet?

Any thoughts on the technical side welcomed.

The message below came across the RedHat list that I read

It was very easy and I basically told the FTC that
this company SCO is committing major fraud by trying
to make people & companies pay for something SCO does NOT even own.
I got a case number in just a few minutes.

They simply dump the information into a database and the
FTC gentleman told me that if there are enough complaints
and there is a pattern, they will investigate the SCO Group.

So pass this around and start calling the FTC to stop the SCO Scumbags.

[From a Slashdot posting....]

I just got off the phone with the FTC. If everyone calls and complains 
then the chances they will investigate SCO goes up. They look for 
patterns. In other words, if the majority of their calls are about SCO 
then they will investigate. It is time to take the Slashdot effect to the 
phones.

These are the key points to make:

-You did not purchase software from SCO
-The company that "produced" your software did not purchase it from SCO
-It was not marketed or packaged by SCO
-Despite this SCO is asking for $199 from home users (You) and $699 from 
business for 1 CPU

They will ask for your name, phone number, address etc. That is mostly to 
verify your identity and citizenship I think.

Here is the number:

1-877-382-4357 option 4

They are nice and listen well. The lady I talked to even took the time to 
get a better understanding of what Linux is. The best quote from her "You 
didn't purchase it from them and they want you to pay them? That sounds 
crazy."
--
Call FTC 1-877-382-4357 opt 4
-You didn't buy from SCO
-Vendor didn't either
-They want $199 ...

            Here's some information that may help. They actually asked for 
this info:

            The SCO Group
            355 South 520 West
            Suite 100
            Lindon, Utah 84042

            801-765-4999 phone

            The guy I spoke with was actually somewhat familiar with what 
Linux is. One of his first questions was how this company got involved 
with me, which my answer was "Well, that's the problem. They didn't."

            He eventually asked if SCO has contacted me personally with 
regard to this situation, which they have not. Don't lie to them. Be 
completely truthful. At the end of the call I got a reference number, and

There might be some self selection going on there. As the Novell site is 
so inconvenient to some folks, like myself, they won't be there to 
suggest that something in Portland would be more convenient.

Since they are name servers, I would say there is a very high likelyhood
that those packets were replies to your own dns queries.

The destination udp port for a dns reply always equals the source udp
port of the original dns query.

So you're saying that my web server sent out DNS queries on these ports?
Doesn't that sound pretty odd? I've removed the DNS servers from my
blacklists, we'll see if it happens again.

Sorry for the broken thread, an old procmailrc got into the system and
tossed your reply.

probably.

> Doesn't that sound pretty odd?

no.  it's like carrier pigeons.  if I send a carrier pigeon to a
server at (ip1, port1), I have to make a place at home, called
(ip0, port0), to receive a carrier pigeon with an answer.  and
since I share ip0 with thousands of other tenants (who often die
quickly), I have to find a port0 that isn't currently being used
by anyone else.  32768 is as good a place to start looking as any.

for linux, search for "ip_local_port_range".

I chose Novell's office for the first venue because of the
free parking, built-in video projector, plenty of seats,
and Internet access. If you know of such a venue that is more
centrally located to those that might attend, please arrange it.

I don't think this is usual BIND behaviour.  BIND listens on a set port
to send recursive queries and stays there throughout its lifetime; it
doesn't randomly bind for out-bound queries like usual clients.  It
seems likely this was a genuine scan to me.

   Er, ... David, I come from Troutdale. That's probably further away than
the rest of the folks who want to attend.

  Perhaps we could meet at PSU in the future; parking is a hassle there, but
it's more centrally located. Regardless of where we meet it will be
inconvenient for someone.

The Urban Grind has all of those qualities and is within walking 
distance of my house. So obviously that's preferable to me (and most 
people who live in close-in portland.) I appreciate that Novell is 
supportive of OSS. I was recently at a Portland Extreme Programmers 
meeting out there. Nice facility.

Thanks for the invitation to arrange things, I'm sure I'll do that, but 
you go ahead with the Latex etc. meeting. I simply wanted to point out 
the self selecting aspect of your plan.

I'm not sure, but I think Wil is referring to a situation
different than what was being discussed. The original
discussion has about the ISP's DNS server responding to
queries from a DNS client. In that case, the destination
port in packets sent by the DNS server to the client will
be the same as the source port in packets sent by the
client to the DNS server.

I think Wil is commenting on BIND behavior when it is
behaving as a client and sending queries to another DNS
server. In that case, Will is correct for the versions of
BIND is done packet snooping on. However, this situation
is almost certain not to be the case unless the client
site is also running an authoritative DNS server.

Of course, I may not have interpreted the messages correctly.

Sometime in the middle of last week I was at Beaverton Library and noticed 
that all of their PC's were down and there was no internet access.  Today 
I was there again, and the PC's were still down.  Now there were signs on 
them explaining that they had been hit by a virus and were tyring to 
recover - so far they've been trying to recover for something like at 
least 4 days.  So, not only can't you browse the web there, you can't look 
anything up in their online catalog either.  I guess people are back to 
using the card catalog (do they even still have those there, I kind of 
doubt it).

This got me to thinking: This is a perfect 'poster project' for open 
source.  Basically, all they've got to do is web browsing and lookup in 
their card catalog - I doubt those machines were even running office, but 
even if they were OpenOffice could be used.  So the question is, how do we 
get a group of Open Source folks together to propose the Linux (or *BSD) 
solution?  One of our big selling points right now for these library folks 
is that they'll be much less vulnerable to viruses... the price is right 
too, but right now that's probably a secondary issue for them.

Anyway, seems like an interesting opportunity for OSS if it can be pitched 
correctly and to the right people.  Seems like I've heard about an open 
source library project out there somewhere...

Phil,

  Regardless of Web browsing, how is the card catalog run? It used to be
'dyna' and I could telnet to it from home. That suggests it's running on a
non-Microsoft host somewhere central. If so, linux and the Web browser of
your choice(s) would work just fine. OTOH, if it's a custom app running
locally then it may work only with Microsoft.

Not really. It's polite to buy coffee and food, of course. They are not 
open on week nights though, so it tends to be a better weekend spot. 
However, they did recently stay open until 8:00pm for a Perl-mongers 
meeting, but I'm not sure if that's a regularly available option.

Because they're a Personal Telco node, there's free wireless access.

For their card catalog is there any reason for them to not use a
proprietary protocol so as to be hardened against crackers?  The
other option is VPN, there's a place the OSS can community can
help.  Is it necessary really to replace Windows entirely or
can Linux be introducted at the just the network routing/network
firewall layers to raise the likelihood of it's acceptance?
Perhaps vmware should be introduced on the workstations.

  Money. Defeats the purpose.

  Suggested steps:

  1) Determine if they're interested in help and a solution.

  2) Learn what runs on those workstations -- as applications.

  3) Figure out what could be done and what advantages the library gains
from implementing change.

They're almost certainly using a networked application, as it would make
no sense to have the card catalog on each machine. If they are using the
dyna system, which seems likely, they just need a web browser and a
telnet client, easily offered by Linux. If they're using something else,
it's probably still offered by the web.

Which I found out pretty easily by looking for beaverton library oregon
on the web and coming up with this page:

http://www.wilinet.wccls.lib.or.us/polaris/default.asp

Looks like a web browser would probably be enough.

  I accessed the Multnomah County library with a Web browser just a couple
of weeks ago. For whatever reason, telneting to dyna from a virtual terminal
didn't want to work. The browser did.

  Looks like a simple solution, eh?

As a proxy server, running on everything from newer dual cpu Dell
servers to recycled PII workstations, Mandrake 9.1 has been quite
stable in my experience. I've had a few problems with 9.0, mostly
when used as a workstation and related to browser stability. 9.1 is
better, especially if you are fond of KDE. It has been quite stable
for home and 3D gaming use. I especially like the KDB CDR app, very
NERO like, and the apt-get fire and forget functionality of urpmi,
not to mention the easy package updater that doesn't require you to
register and maintain your service account like Redhat does. 9.2
should be out this month, so that's what I'm waiting for before I
upgrade my business workstation from 9.0. So far, it has met my
requirements quite well.

YMMV, Sean Harbour

Message-ID: <h79kP5PqZeeufZzKWMc5BPV7UbWH@4ax.com>

HI All,
Just wanted to post my thanks on all the recent request I've made
here.

I have a set of working Redhat 7.3 install disc, which easily repaired
the machine I managed to muck up.

I have Star Office 6.0 installed on both Linux boxes and have set
myself the goal to become familiar with it by Christmas.

I have Samba and Apache installed on both machines(have no Idea what
to do with them, but they're installed)

I have fixed a nagging Printer problem on one of the two Linux
boxes(I'm still getting strange reactions from the second box)

I have Java sdk installed on both machines and have written two basic
learning programs( how many times can one learn to say "Hello World"?)

I still have several projects I'd like to undertake but have decided
to scale back and try to get these running to my satisfaction first.
So Email and News groups are still being done on the Windows machine.
However, I really like Galeon and Konqueror.

I wanted to express my thanks to one and all for their untiring
assistance.

I want to express my regrets at not being able to take any Linux
classes this fall due to a reduction in my ability to cover the cost
for tuition. Thus making it not only painful for missing Ed's class,
but that I must miss Mike's class as well. 
I'm stuck doing a painfully useless class which the college has
decided is required for the degree. I have one more such class before
I'm free of the tether of such garbage. I'd like to know what idiot or
group of idiots within the school decided that UNIX was a dead system
and removed 90% of the classes that were available in 1999. 

Again, thank you to each of you who have been of invaluable help.

sincerely,

Harry

Not really. It's polite to buy coffee and food, of course. They are not
open on week nights though, so it tends to be a better weekend spot.
However, they did recently stay open until 8:00pm for a Perl-mongers
meeting, but I'm not sure if that's a regularly available option.

Because they're a Personal Telco node, there's free wireless access.

This is exactly why I don't use a portsentry like program any longer. 

It's very easy for someone to inflict a DOS attach on you, using your own machine. They simply spoof packets coming from various places, your port sentry denies you access to those sites, and viola...

At least, that's the scenario from the last time I run portsentry. Do they have anything to protect you from this in there now?

Subject: [PLUG] Can user defined chains be added...
Message-ID: <1063588992.4758.10.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

to the FORWARD chain?

I know this can be done with the INPUT and OUTPUT chains in iptables.

The following is an example of what I am trying to do with a
user defined chain I want to add to the FORWARD chain.
There is local DNS where goose is the hostname of one ip
address I want to work with.  The eth0 interface goes to
a lan.

#!/bin/bash

goose_ip=host goose|cut -d ' ' -f4

IN_INT_1="eth0"             # Internal network interface 1.


case "$1" in

open)

        iptables -F masq_goose

        iptables -A masq_goose -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED \
                               --in-interface $IN_INT_1 -s $goose_ip \
                               -j ACCEPT
                ;;

close|*)

        iptables -F masq_goose

                ;;
esac



The original piece where I use goose_ip is 192.168.1.0/24.  This is
part of a project to implement a selective Internet lock for
individual workstations.  If I can't add user defined chains to
the FORWARD chain, how can I find the rule that allows goose
out and remove just that rule?  If I'm not mistaken for say 
rules 1 through 5, deleting rule number 1 causes rule 2 to 
become rule 1.  The purpose of open is to add the forwarding
rule for goose if it isn't already added where close is supposed 
to remove the rule for goose.  Can you just write out the rule
you want deleted from the forward chain instead of using a number?

Message-ID: <1063593412.5286.3.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I've got a different approach than adding a chain to the FORWARD
chain which doesn't seem to work using the following script:

#!/bin/bash 
# Close or open Internet gateway for a specific host.
# First argument is open or close whereas second is the
# hostname of the host that needs to be open or closed.

close_number=`/sbin/iptables --line-numbers -L FORWARD | grep $2  | cut
-f1 -d ' '`
# Get the number of the rule that shouldn't exist or should be removed.

IN_INT=eth0
# This is the interface connected to the proper lan.

ip=`host $2 | cut -d ' ' -f4`
# Get the ip address of the host seeing a change in
# Internet connectivity status.

user=`whoami`

if [ $user == root ];then

case "$1" in

open)
        if [ ! $close_number ];then
		iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED \
         	         	    --in-interface $IN_INT -s $ip \
                       	            -j ACCEPT
        fi
		;;

close)

        if [ $close_number ];then
        	iptables -D FORWARD $close_number
 	fi
		;;
*)
	exit 1
esac

fi

The weakest is the part where I need to determine the rule number
since it assumes there will be one FORWARD rule by the hostname
that one desires to manipulate if there are any.  It would make
sense to test the arguments coming in too :-)  Course if I only
use this with a program that inputs the right arguments to it
there won't be any problems.

What do you mean "locally"?  Doesn't all of Washington County use the
same system?  Probably centralized then, and out of one library's
hand.

I think a gradual approach would go over better with them.  For
instance, you could start just with all the browsers (that alone would
save thousands in license fees, assuming they keep upgrading, and
would get the most bang for the buck in putting Linux in the public
eye).

Probably what they would like would be for some volunteers to show up
and say, here's our general idea, now we'd like to talk to your IT
folks and study it for a few weeks, then we'll present our results.
Probably the head of the committee should be someone from Beaverton,
as that would look more like "community volunteer wants to help his
local library" rather than "activist with an ax to grind."  Though if
it works in Beaverton, no reason why it couldn't easily be ported to
the other Washington County libraries.

I first thought of contacting them and suggesting Linux when I read a
few months ago that they were cutting their hours to cut costs.  I was
then going to suggest this to PLUG, but decided to READ the PLUG mail
first.

One way, use any of the mail id's found in the first column of mailq 
output and search for it like this.


find /var/spool/postfix/ | grep 0E9AAAD0F


On my system, I found a file in /var/spool/postfix/deferred/0/E/0E9AAAD0F 
with an entry of: (using ls -l)

-rwx------ 1 postfix  postfix 5467 Sep 15  2003 /var/spool/postfix/deferred/0/E/0E9AAAD0F


Use a text pager like more or less and view the contents.

less /var/spool/postfix/deferred/0/E/0E9AAAD0F


be carefull of non-readable ASCII characters due to mime encodings.

  For reasons I do not understand, postfix puts deferred mail into one of 16
subdirectories in either /var/spool/posfix/defer or
/var/spool/postfix/deferred. I've found deferred mail one place or the
other.

The other place was

and contains the second line of a mailq listing.  For this example:

I am backing up a Linux box to a DDS2 drive.  The backup shows that 4.7GB were 
backed up but it doesn't tell me how much of the tape is used to do this.

I'm simply tarring stuff off to tape here.  The tape is obviously compressing 
the data because 4.7GB is more than a DDS2 can hold uncompressed.  How do I 
tell how much of the tape is used (or what my compression ratio is)?

Not exactly - do you know what was the source port of the packets you
saw from your ISP's nameservers?

Here's an example of what may have happened:

10:04:09.097639 192.168.151.10.1059 > 192.168.98.125.53:  32563+ A?
www.rauhaus.org. (33) (DF)
10:04:09.100304 192.168.98.125.53 > 192.168.151.10.1059:  32563 2/2/1
CNAME kort.rauhaus.org., (128) (DF)

192.168.151.10 is the client, and 192.168.98.125 is the name server. The
client sends a udp packet, source port 1059 and destination port 53 to
the name server for the dns request.

The server responds with an answer from source port 53 and
_destination_ port 1059, which was the source port from which the query
came.

It may be that portsentry doesn't know to watch your outgoing dns
queries so as not to classify the replies as being hostile.

Does that make sense? So if the packets you saw coming from your ISP
nameservers were source port 53, then they may have been innocuous.

One caveat would be that there are port scanners that purposely set
the source port of their packets to 53 to make them look like dns
replies and so get past intrusion detection systems and some firewalls.

Check out this page:

http://home.t-online.de/home/Andreas.Steinmetz/unix/ddsutil.html

Basically it says to use uncompressed DDS and to use host-side
compression.  Not only will you get better compression, but you'll be able
to tell how much you have used on each tape.

To answer your question, you can tell how much tape you have left by
writing more and more to the tape until you get a write error back.  Then
you have no space left.  Isn't hardware compression great?  :-(

I did some reading about the compression algorithm that these drives
use.  I dug up descriptions, but never having coded one of these
before and because the verbal descriptions were (to me anyway)
somewhat ambiguous, I never understood it sufficiently to implement.
The compression format is called DCLZ (google is your friend).
However, if one could implement a compressor/decompressor, they (and
all beneficiaries of this work) could determine tape usage _and_ use
hardware compression.

Hi,

Fall term starts next Monday and there are two Linux classes at PCC.

CIS240L is a Linux Installation and Configuration class covering the main 
tasks involved in setting up and administering a stand alone Linux 
box.  You should have a basic understanding of a *nix file system and basic 
command line utilities.  Two sections are offered, one on the Internet and 
one that meets at Sylvania from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Monday nights.

CIS279L is a Linux Networking class covering TCP/IP plus network utilities, 
applications (NFS, Samba, DNS, DHCP, Apache, Sendmail, Postfix, etc.), 
troubleshooting and an introduction to security. One section is offered 
from 2 PM to 4 PM, Tuesday and Thursday.

Both classes are command line oriented and have lots of hands on labs.

Both classes

Go to www.pcc.edu and register online or just come to class and we'll 
figure it out from there.

Please e-mail me off list for more details or questions.

Thanks,
Mike Neal

It seems like knowing the algorithm wouldn't help if the drive itself
didn't report the compression ratio or tape used.  To make use of it you
would need to:

  + compress the data to get the ratio
  + uncompress the data
  + send it to the drive
  + drive compresses it exactly the same way
  + during restore, drive uncompresses the data on the fly

I suppose if the drive supported it you could also:
  + compress the data to get the ratio
  + send it to the drive compressed
  + drive fails to compress it any more and just stores it
  + during restore, hopefully drive sees the DCLZ format data on the tape
and uncompresses it on the fly during or else you'll need a DCLZ
decompression utility for restores

The first method probably uses more CPU time than just running it through
a better compression algorithm.  The second method may not work if the
drive stores the DCLZ data flagged as "uncompressed" so it doesn't try to
decompress it on the way out.

In either case if I really needed to know how much of the tape is used,
I'd skip the DDS compression.  Normally I don't-- when the tape fills, I
just put in a new one.  ;-)  (Or as is more often the case, I put in a new
CD-R...)

Big news from Geneva this week as the UN wraps up plans for the first 
World Summit on the Information Society. High on the list of priorities 
for WSIS is an action plan requiring governments to back Open Source 
Software so that more countries can cross the digital divide. Spurred on 
by the U.S. Commerce Dept., the U.S. delegation is attempting to water 
down the UN Action Plan while Microsoft's pet lobbying group muses about 
a cataclysmic counterstrike using the WTO. Learn more as we trace the 
latest global drumbeats for Open Source and the proprietary diplomats 
who can press the WTO button if polite diplomacy fails.

In San Francisco this week, the International Bar Association meets to 
discuss how to capitalize on hot case issues. Not surprisingly, both 
intellectual property and digital rights are on that list in this 
post-Napster world.

Theoretically you could pipe the data through a program that computed
the compressed size, but echo'd the uncompressed data.  Such a program
would probably have pretty low overhead.

Fascinating site by the way.  I like open-mag a lot.  How can 
third world countries promotion of open source software be any 
kind of world trade violation?  Microsoft should get off it's 
high horse and work on improving interoperability and the 
clearing away of bugs instead of attacking the freedom of 
individuals and even whole countries to take full advantage 
of open source options.  So much effort on locking people 
into Windows seems like a terrible waste to me.  If Microsoft 
would restructure to be OSS friendly, I'm sure the company 
can survive after a change of heart.

The greater concern I have with increasing Internet access is 
the need to address the problems on this network better for 
people who will be facing them in ever increasing numbers for 
the first time in the near future.  Unlike traditional media 
and traditional advertisement, the Internet creates a totally 
new dynamic between people.  All the more reason OSS is 
more appropriate than ever for the needs of the world at
large is it's security record and flexibility.

Doubtless you've heard of this by now. (see Slashdot)

Here are my fave quotes from news.admin.net-abuse.email:

"The incompetent amoral liars at Verisign have made it impossible to 
reject mail from .net and .com addresses whose domain parts do not 
exist, by setting up wildcard DNS on the gtld-server.net machines"

"Verisign has destroyed the root domain hierarchy! Make up any bloody domain 
name, and what do you get? The domain exists, the response mail adddress is 
nstld.verisign-grs.com, the authoritative nameserver is a.gtld-servers.net

And it advertises their services. Holy crap."

"Yes, that's right.  It doesn't matter what a client says, Verithief's
"stub" mail server says 220, 250, 250, 550, 250, 221-close.

This is presumably the SMTP equivalent of flipping one's finger over
one's lip and going "buh buh buh".

Thank goodness we have the spineless, useless ICANN overseeing these 
matters....I feel so much better now...

I'm sorry to say it like this, but is this a joke or are you really this
naive?

Microsoft makes a killing on proprietary software, Red Hat makes a bare
survival off Open Source (it's doing better recently, but nowhere near
Microsoft).

And there's a logical fallacy in your argument, indeed in almost
everything you write: there is a difference between what should be and
what is. You do not make the law, and the law does not usually derive
from what "should" be. Anytime you find yourself tempted to write what
"should" be, you might want to think about what _is_ instead. If you
want to make what "should" be happen, you need to understand why things
are the way they are.

I sincerely apologize to you and anyone else who considers this harsh. I
write this because you've written a lot of naive interpretations of what
should be, ignoring what is, and why it is this way. 

and yes, this is way off topic now.

Jeff

Actually, I *was* talking about Novell.

BTW, isn't the date (9/17) a really bad choice, since it will
interfere with the PLUG meeting?  I'd expect there'd be a big overlap
between Linux users and La/TeX users.  (Don't most Windows users just
use Office?)

(My apologies in advance if any Windows La/TeX users are reading
this.)

I don't know about dyna in particular.  Obviously it's a dumb
terminal-oriented system, right?  Did you use a VT100 emulator?
That's what most of them expect.

BTW, I sent an e-mail to the library (librarymail at ci.beaverton.or.us)
suggesting they consider switching to Linux (appended below).  It was
a general address (off their website -- they don't know about munging
addresses) so they told me they were forwarding it to their tech
planning group.  If anyone else is inclined to write, don't mention
this letter or they'll write it off as a campaign.

Kevin

------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm a resident of Hillsboro who regularly uses the Washington County
libraries (Shute Park, Tanasbourne, and Beaverton).  While visiting
the Beaverton library yesterday, I saw notices about the computers
being down due to the worm attacks.  I would like to suggest a way to
improve the security of the library's computers, as well as cut costs.
That is to migrate its computers from Microsoft Windows to Linux.

As your IT department probably knows, the recent worm attacks
exploited a vulnerability in the core Microsoft Windows operating
system.  But this is not an isolated incident.  View any of the
websites devoted to computer security, and you'll see the vast
majority of the security advisories pertain to vulnerabilities in
Windows systems.  There are many reasons why Microsoft has such a poor
security record, too many to go into here.  But suffice it to say that
people running Linux and Unix machines with a modest amount of
security knowledge have not had any problems.

Another reason to switch as many machines as possible to Linux would
be enormous cost savings.  The Beaverton library has dozens of
computers just for public use, not to mention the ones used by the
staff.  Most of these machines are just used for browsing and perusing
the library catalog.  These functions can be performed just as well by
systems based on free software (Linux or FreeBSD, for instance),
saving thousands of dollars in licensing costs in a single library
alone.  Furthermore, switching to Linux can lead to hardware savings
as well, as it is much easier to strip a Linux machine down to only
its essential applications.  This means that Linux clients can
typically run fine on older hardware which would not be fast enough to
run a current version of Windows.

An additional savings of Linux would be eliminating the administrative
costs of license bookkeeping.  As Oregon's schools found out last
year, Microsoft likes to spring surprise audits on large
organizations, knowing that given enough machines, they can usually
find a few in which the paper licenses have been lost, in which case
they can use the threat of a lawsuit to coerce a new licensing deal
which is favorable to them.  Are YOUR licenses all in order?

I know several people in the Washington County area who would be
interested in studying what could be done to lower the library's costs
while improving its security.  Please reply to this e-mail if you
think you would be interested.

Sincerely,

Kevin Theobald
Hillsboro

There's a PLUG meeting on a Wednesday in the middle of the month?

I thought they were all on the first Thursday (which never works for my

Microsoft can hang itself on it's own proprietary software 
where OSS is gaining clout and people are starting to realize, 
as they always should, that there are multiple software options.
Windows is getting worse programming wise where pushing other 
vendors out of Windows, Microsoft is slowly but surely hurting 
itself.  Ironically, it's the closed endedness of Windows that 
will make it a platform supporting fewer and fewer apps.  NT
hasn't taken over from Linux/UNIX and I'll bet Gate's $6 billion
dollars that it won't take over by any future date.  Sloppy
coding can only work for so long.
 
If anything, open source systems do not automatically translate 
to zero money made on programs and services.  Microsoft would 
have a lot easier time helping with the task of fixing bugs 
in Linux than it does trying to write a closed system that's 
anywhere near comparable.  The company is fool hardly being 
seen as a monopolist for not behaving appropriately enough
to even begin to mitigate that conception.  For one thing,
it shows a total lack of gratitude for the country that 
allowed so much monetary success amid years of 
anticompetitive activities.

I like what the free software foundation says about it not being
important to make the most money to have real clout.  Why do we 
blindly accept money clout instead of evaluating on more than one 
criteria?  I don't see anything fundamentally wrong with talking 
about how things should be and why, this in and of itself is not 
a logical fallacy though I may annoy people who only want change 
now, etc.
  
Linus's project was to create a kernel, he didn't tell 
anyone at any time not to say, "hey, I have this 
proprietary program/library or pay for service offer to help 
you use that kernel more affectively."  There is nothing 
stopping Microsoft, accept perhaps incompetence, from 
using Linux as it's base operating system and writing software,
libraries, etc. to run on top of it.  The other thing is, why 
won't we move on instead of accepting Microsoft's claim that 
it has some right to charge whatever for anything that can 
be construed to be software?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
And there's a logical fallacy in your argument, indeed in almost
everything you write: there is a difference between what should be and
what is. You do not make the law, and the law does not usually derive
from what "should" be. Anytime you find yourself tempted to write what
"should" be, you might want to think about what _is_ instead. If you
want to make what "should" be happen, you need to understand why things
are the way they are.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I wasn't aware I am writer of any laws at all.  In fact, I'm not.  I'm
not trained or even qualified to cause change.  I only see laws change
when I have a chance to vote and my vote wins.  It's early for Linux
based companies.  There's a misconception out there that no services are
needed for Linux systems or that offering such services won't pay.  This
is wrong though I'll admit I'm not lobbying for all the Linux people to
become millionaires like historic Microsoft employees.  There are people
who can obtain high levels of skill in working with information and
programming systems who will be paid something to support Linux because
there is a need out there.

The accusations quoted are not very good as they are not detailed
enough where the purpose of these accusations is also alien to me.

If hoping Microsoft will have a change of heart with regard to
attacking the GPL and advocating enslavement of all people to
a excessively confining software model naive, call me naive then.

Obviously the issue is with me and not with Linux, so why did
you post to the list Jeff creating spam for everyone?

I appreciate all the help I've gotten from various people but it's not
doing much good to be on here anymore because of a few people, who know
who they are, that seem to think it's necessary to pick on other
posters for kicks.

As far as the complaint I don't recognize how things are instead of
talking about what they should be or perhaps could be, that's rude.  
A friend of mine got off the list claiming that one of the OT topics 
got really raunchy.  I've had it.  I'm not intentionally trying to
insult anyone, yet I'm still catching flak far too often.

Some inclusive community this is shaping up as.  I think a couple
of individuals need to be kicked off the list to restore decency.  
I'm sure these individuals contributed to Ken Barber's decision 
to get off the list.

Hi Michael,

I'd be sorry to see you go. Don't leave because some people on this list
send nasty comments. Just ignore or kill file them. Rough voices are
most everywhere; the world can become quite small and quiet when you
walk from all those places.

The PLUG Advanced Topics meeting is this Wednesday, but Zot doesn't seem
to have announced it.

We just upgraded our phone system and as a result have 40 Panasonic

If anyone is in the market for something like this, contact me off

items.

Apologies for the OT.

Subject: [PLUG] SSH exploit in the wild
Message-ID: <20030916163444.GE11670@dalsemi.com>

Troubling news this morning:

http://slashdot.org/articles/03/09/16/1327248.shtml?tid=126&tid=172

Apparently there's an SSH exploit out there.  Most of the links
are already slashdott'ed, but here's another one that hasn't been
yet:

http://docs.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=2498+0+current/freebsd-security

Basically they recommend 3 alternatives until the exploit is found
and patched:

1) Switch to lsh
2) Add explicit rules to all your edge devices allowing ssh from
   only-known hosts.
3) Put ssh behind a VPN on RFC-1918 space.


Would anyone like to explain to me (us) what alternative #2 is and how
to implement it?

Colin

This code base isn't mature. It's not an option.

You can use tcpwrappers (/etc/hosts.{allow,deny}), if you've compiled
sshd against libwrap. Or, you can use the AllowUsers directive in
sshd_config to allow only certain users from certain hosts.

Subject: [PLUG] Previous request for network topology help.
Message-ID: <E19zKAv-0007pc-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

I was over thinking the problem.

I found the resolution, basically, in this document:
http://www.linuxguruz.com/iptables/howto/2.4routing-5.html
specifically section 5.3 on GRE tunnels.

To restate; I was having a conceptual problem figuring out how to set up two linux routers 
at two seperate locations. Each one has it's own connection to the internet, and they are 
connected via a leased-dsl line, and the networks behind each router need to "see" each 
other (specifically, the warehouse needs to see the servers here).

Currently, the warehouse shares our internet connection over the leased DSL line, and 
at "some point in the next three months" I will be asked how to configure the two boxes. 
And thanks to this document I think I can do it (I have a fairly good grasp of TCPIP and 
routing, I just had a hard time imagining what I was setting up where- the hardware was 
hard for me to figure out, if that makes sense.).

Thanks to all of you for your brain-cycles. :)

Apparently 3.7p1 is safe against said threat...

Upgrade!

I have a Slackware 8.1 package if anybody needs one.  I can get
Slackware 8.0 or 9.0 packages, as well, as I have a friend running
around madly patching his boxes.  Email me off-list and I'll give you a
URL... or if you have enough bandwidth to host them, even better.  :-)

Better yet, hit me on Jabber if you have it (athlonrob at axpr.net)

Here is RH's security update notification:

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated OpenSSH packages fix potential vulnerability
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:279-01
Issue date:        2003-09-16
Updated on:        2003-09-16
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:
Cross references:
Obsoletes:         RHSA-2003:222
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0693
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated OpenSSH packages are now available that fix a bug that may be
remotely exploitable.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.1 - i386
Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

OpenSSH is a suite of network connectivity tools that can be used to
establish encrypted connections between systems on a network and can
provide interactive login sessions and port forwarding, among other functions.

The OpenSSH team has announced a bug which affects the OpenSSH buffer
handling code.  This bug has the potential of being remotely exploitable.

All users of OpenSSH should immediately apply this update which contains a
backported fix for this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

I'll second that. My enjoyment of the list greatly increased when I
discovered how to toss out mail based on whether or not there were
certain names in the mail, that way I don't get the original post or any
posts quoting the poster. 

I know that sounds childish, but IRL, I get to choose who I listen to,
too. It's just more automatic this way.

How about just an emerge sync && emerge -U openssh ?

I like that better.

Why type out words?  You need extra letters and that extra - for them.

I'm a prime sucker. I have on 7.1 system that I didn't update the SSH
certificate on. Now, when I need to update it, I need to update the
up2date, too. I got the files, and went into upgrade vortex. the new
up2date needs mkinitrd >= 3.2.2. The lowest package that satisfies that
is 3.2.6-1, which requires filesystem >= 2.1.0.

That sounds serious. This system is only running an old website for a
customer until I force him to review and upgrade (it's a long story).

Since I have physical access to the system should I screw with it or
just turn SSH off?

Suggestions welcomed

Rich,
I've heard from one developer, that LaTeX may die in a nearest 
future, when everybody switches to XML/XSLT/Schema/SAX/DOM standards.
I was considering using LaTeX while I was developing company's
documentation system, but XML/SAX/Perl approach bound to MySQL worked 
the best.

Just my $0.02

With an exploit in the wild it's a matter of time before the host is 
compromised.  either enable tcp_wrappers for the host or turn ssh off.

BTW, I haven't used up2date in quite awhile to keep a rpm based system 
updated.  Rsync and "rpm -Fvh" have all that I have needed to do.

Alex,

  If you listen to people in the computer industry you'll get the answer you
received. Yes, for computer documentation, XML, DocBook and the like are a
great way to go. However, for _typeset_ output there's nothing like TeX and
the LaTeX macros.

  One-size-fits-all solutions don't. You need to consider the vested
interests of the solution promoter/provider as well as your intended use
before making a decision.

Skip up2date and all of its dependencies. Just download the ssh rpm files 
from Red Hat and apply them manually with the rpm utility:

   rpm -Fhv openssh*.rpm

wget ftp://updates.redhat.com/8.0/en/os/i386/openssh-*-5.i386.rpm
rpm -Fvh openssh-*-5.i386.rpm

...if you're using 8.0.

You probably need to adjust the 8.0 and the -5 to match up with whatever
version you're on.

afaik, Red Hat 7.1 is no longer supported. You can try installing the

or you can grab the .src.rpm and rebuild it.

I'm building from the RHL 9 src file right now on a RHL 7.3 system. The
only thing I changed in the spec file was to disable X-Windows System
stuff and away it went.
   Now to move the RPMs to the all the servers and get them upgraded.

7.1 is still supported. 7.0 is not.

Side note: If you have a 7.0 system, my experience so far is that all
Red Hat 7.1 RPM updates that have come out since 7.0 support was 
discontinued work ok on 7.0, excluding the 2.4 kernel and related packages
like modutils. (7.0 was the last to run a 2.2 kernel.)

Message-ID: <54786.68.107.223.201.1063753255.squirrel@webmail.pdxlug.org>

I have a Javascript popup window where the user chooses some settings and
then clicks submit.  After submitting, the form vars are sent to a perl
script that saves the vars as cookies on the user's box.  I would like the
popup window to close when they click submit, so I added
onsubmit="window.close()", but when I do this the cookies are no longer
set.  It's as if the window is closed before the perl script is called. 
Any suggestions on how to fix this?  I know I could just set the cookies
with Javascript, but I'm curious about how to make this way work.
Thanks,
~M

you could have the perl script do/return the following:

# processing stuff

print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";

# split into 2 print statements for mail client readability
print "<html><head></head><body onLoad=\"window.close()\">"; 
print "Close Me</body></html>";

Yes, the javascript runs before the data is submitted, and therefore
you're closing the window before the data is submitted. You've got two
choices, or at least, two obvious choices:

1) have the perl script return a page which has a button which says
"close window." This is a standard solution.
2) have javascript set the cookies. The reason this is less preferable
is that javascript is ... well, many people write poor javascript, and
the quality of the javascript interpreters has varied over the years,
and so it's less guaranteed that this will work for all users and won't
kill other things (i.e. all instances of the browser by accident =).
Still, you could do it, if you wrote impeccable javascript and assumed
everybody will be using a modern browser

I'm looking at replacing bind. I looked at tinydns, but it won't do zone
transfers, and I need that. 

I host two domains myself, and I have secondary server duties for about
8 other domains. 

Is there something besides bind that does this?

-----Original Message-----
From: owner-announce at openbsd.org [mailto:owner-announce at openbsd.org]On
Behalf Of Markus Friedl

To: announce at openbsd.org
Subject: OpenSSH 3.7.1 released


OpenSSH 3.7.1 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support to the project, especially those who contributed source and
bought T-shirts or posters.

We have a new design of T-shirt available, more info on
        http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html#18

For international orders use https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order
and for European orders, use https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu

Security Changes:
=================

  All versions of OpenSSH's sshd prior to 3.7.1 contain buffer
  management errors.  It is uncertain whether these errors are
  potentially exploitable, however, we prefer to see bugs
  fixed proactively.

  OpenSSH 3.7 fixed one of these bugs.

  OpenSSH 3.7.1 fixes more similar bugs.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.6.1:
============================ 

* The entire OpenSSH code-base has undergone a license review. As
  a result, all non-ssh1.x code is under a BSD-style license with no
  advertising requirement. Please refer to README in the source
  distribution for the exact license terms.

* Rhosts authentication has been removed in ssh(1) and sshd(8).

* Changes in Kerberos support:

    - KerberosV password support now uses a file cache instead of
      a memory cache.

    - KerberosIV and AFS support has been removed.

    - KerberosV support has been removed from SSH protocol 1.

    - KerberosV password authentication support remains for SSH
      protocols 1 and 2.

    - This release contains some GSSAPI user authentication support
      to replace legacy KerberosV authentication support. At present
      this code is still considered experimental and SHOULD NOT BE
      USED.
  
* Changed order that keys are tried in public key authentication.
  The ssh(1) client tries the keys in the following order:

     1. ssh-agent(1) keys that are found in the ssh_config(5) file
     2. remaining ssh-agent(1) keys
     3. keys that are only listed in the ssh_config(5) file

  This helps when an ssh-agent(1) has many keys, where the sshd(8)
  server might close the connection before the correct key is tried.

* SOCKS5 support has been added to the dynamic forwarding mode
  in ssh(1).

* Removed implementation barriers to operation of SSH over SCTP.

* sftp(1) client can now transfer files with quote characters in
  their filenames.

* Replaced sshd(8)'s VerifyReverseMapping with UseDNS option.
  When UseDNS option is on, reverse hostname lookups are always
  performed.

* Fix a number of memory leaks.

* Support for sending tty BREAK over SSH protocol 2.

* Workaround for other vendor bugs in KEX guess handling.

* Support for generating KEX-GEX groups (/etc/moduli) in ssh-keygen(1).

* Automatic re-keying based on amount of data sent over connection.

* New AddressFamily option on client to select protocol to use (IPv4
  or IPv6).

* Experimental support for the "aes128-ctr", "aes192-ctr", and
  "aes256-ctr" ciphers for SSH protocol 2.

* Experimental support for host keys in DNS (draft-ietf-secsh-dns-xx.txt).
  Please see README.dns in the source distribution for details.

* Portable OpenSSH:

    - Replace PAM password authentication kludge with a more correct
      PAM challenge-response module from FreeBSD.

    - PAM support may now be enabled/disabled at runtime using the
      UsePAM directive.

    - Many improvements to the OpenSC smartcard support.

    - Regression tests now work with portable OpenSSH.
      Please refer to regress/README.regress in the source distribution.

    - On platforms that support it, portable OpenSSH now honors the
      UMASK, PATH and SUPATH attributes set in /etc/default/login.

    - Deny access to locked accounts, regardless of authentication
      method in use.

Checksums:
==========

- MD5 (openssh-3.7.1.tgz) = 3d2f1644d6a3d3267e5e2421f1385129
- MD5 (openssh-3.7.1p1.tar.gz) = f54e574e606c08ef63ebb1ab2f7689dc


Reporting Bugs:
===============

- please read http://www.openssh.com/report.html
  and http://bugzilla.mindrot.org/

OpenSSH is brought to you by Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt,
Kevin Steves, Damien Miller, Ben Lindstrom, Darren Tucker and Tim Rice.

I think IIS includes a DNS server....

But.... ugh.

Why don't you like bind?  Maybe there's something you can do to it so
bind is more what you're looking for?

There's also djbdns... which lists other servers:

Yes it does. Use rsync over ssh, which is sane and dependable, or 
djbdns-axfrdns. Visit http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html, everything is completely 
documented. See http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/run-server.html for zone transfers. As 
Ed, my favorite cranky DNS guru said once, it's just moving plain text files, 
for gosh sakes, you don't need some freaky horrid BIND hack.

That might work, if the admin on the other end was interested in 
changing software too.

However, he's perfectly happy with bind.

I need standard zone transfers between servers that know each other.

Giving a cursory glance to Rick Moen's list of free software bind
replacements <http://www.linuxmafia.com/~rick/linux-info/dns-servers>,
it appears that at a minimum MaraDNS does this.

The 3rd Wednesday of each month is the "Advanced Topics" meeting.
Tomorrow night the topic is disk drives "in three beers."  (They

You can do zone transfers between BIND and tinydns. As Carla
mentioned, this is done with axfrdns. It takes a little
setup to get working though - nothing tough, just attention
to detail.

This is a nice comprehensive list that he's put together.
Just note that Rick is biased against tinydns. You can see
this for yourself on the above referenced web page. He
placed djbdns in the Proprietary category for two reasons.
He doesn't like the fact that Bernstein doesn't use the GPL.
It seems that he thinks that anything that is not GPL'ed is
proprietary software.

He also believes that tinydns is not RFC-compliant because it
doesn't support BIND-like zone transfers - and anything that
is not RFC-compliant shouldn't be used. I disagree strongly
with this assertion but I've failed to convince him otherwise.

It works great.  I use tinydns/dnscache for internal IP space and an external server
running tinydns/axfrdns for real IP space.  I have three secondary Sprint DNS server
pulling zone transfers without issue from the external server.

Internally I use rsync-over-ssh to push to secondary djbdns servers.  Again.. works
great.

Try reading the docs. You can do zone transfers between BIND and tinydns just 
fine. You didn't say you wanted to be a secondary to BIND servers; that 
limits your choices of how to actually make zone transfers.

I don't care what you use, use trained pigeons for all I care. Just don't run 
around saying it can't be done, because it can.

Message-ID: <1063783507.1139.39.camel@fastlinux.homenet>

This is a little story about the struggle to understand the workings of
the brains in Redmond.  It starts with a linux server called
"newserver".  This server is being set up to be transported off to do
some real good in the world.  The lowly test technician has just set up
Samba.  He changes the workgroup name to "WG", he makes the home
directories writable, and then he creates a common share called "share"
and makes it writable.  After running the command 

/etc/init.d/samba restart

the server starts with no complaints.

Now the fun starts, the lowly tech then goes to an XP (pro edition)
machine to test the newly started samba server.  "Where the hell is the
workgroup browsing link", he screams, "all I get with the Network
browsing button is the last share I logged into, I know the network is
bigger than that!"  After intense searching, the Workgroup browse link
suddenly appears in a spot that had been thoroughly searched before.

"Whew", he says, "now lets see if we can find the "WG" workgroup.  Ah,
there it is, but nothing is in it!"  Having seen this before, the lowly
tech then changed the XP's workgroup to "WG", did the mandatory reboot
and finally found newserver.

Now, lurking in the background is another server called "bigserv" in
another workgroup called "shop".  This server is also running bind with
an experimental gforge  install.  During the installation, the zone file
for shop was heavily modified, including a wildcard entry that points to
bigserv.

So, lowly tech logs into newserver, got the username and password
prompt, and then was shown a list of shares.  But wait, there is
something fishy about those shares.  Those are the share on bigserv!  He
confirmed this by going into his home directory, sure enough, that is
the home directory on bigserv, not the nice clean directory of the fresh
new newserver.

After the wildcard entry was deleted, the XP box did log into the
correct server, but the lesson had been learned!  You can't trust
anything that XP tells you about the network, particularly the name of
the server that you are logging into!

Thanks for letting me vent.

  Cookies are browser based.  You'll need to set the cookie value in the
browser before you submit the form.  The current cookie values are sent to
the CGI script with the HTTP GET.  You can't set the values after the
submit.  It's too late.

  I had a similar situation with a little web app I recently wrote.  I was
using cookies to maintain state information about the display pages.  The
cookie *has* to be set before submit so the CGI script receives the correct
cookie values.  I tried a bunch different techniques.  I finally used
Javascript to get it working correctly.

I'm a prime sucker. I have on 7.1 system that I didn't update the SSH
certificate on. Now, when I need to update it, I need to update the
up2date, too. I got the files, and went into upgrade vortex. the new
up2date needs mkinitrd >= 3.2.2. The lowest package that satisfies that
is 3.2.6-1, which requires filesystem >= 2.1.0.

That sounds serious. This system is only running an old website for a
customer until I force him to review and upgrade (it's a long story).

Since I have physical access to the system should I screw with it or
just turn SSH off?

Suggestions welcomed

I understand it's just a set of scripts, can I just copy them into

It's part of procmail, which is quite useful in its own right.

Good luck,

  I just had a very fine experience with an on-line technical bookstore in
California: www.nerdbooks.com. The owner's name is Dave and their service is
extraordinary.

  If you cannot find it at Powell's Technical Books, I strongly recommend
nerdbooks.com.

There's a slight difference between the cases: he's talking about the
perl script setting the cookies (which it can do) before going on to do
other things. You're talking about a submit box to a script which needs
the cookies already set. If they have to _already_ be set by the time
the script acts, then you need javascript (or an intervening script). If
they are set by this particular script (it sounds likely that this is an
intermediary script specifically for setting cookies, since it's in a
popup window) then it can be set by perl or by javascript. If it's set
by javascript, it doesn't even need to send anything to the server, and
you might be able to do it with a java applet, instead. But in either
case, they're different situations.

it's not ati or r128?

the inspirons have been using ATI cards for a while, but I'm not sure
that they still do. What do you get from this command?

lspci

And if that doesn't work, can you go to Dell's website, login using your
express service tag, and look under system information to see what the
name of the graphics card is?

Their (OO.o) regex parsing engine was broken last time I looked. I think
we discussed it on this list, so you can check the archives (search for
OO.o) for details.

  I don't have OO open now (I'm writing in LyX), but I believe that it's on
the Edit menu that one finds a "hidden" option. I've assumed that displays
stuff we normally don't see.

This Wednesday, September 17, at 6:30 pm is our first get together
for those interested in TeX, LaTeX, and related software. We'll
meet at Novell's office in Tigard across from Washington Square.
Directions are here:

http://panug.org/meetings/#direct

We'll decide then whether to meet at a more convenient place and time
in the future. We have a video projector available and I'll
bring a computer with TeX-related software and you're welcome to
as well. There's no set topics to be presented, presenters, or
even a format to be followed. We'll work that out when we meet.
There's certainly no shortage of things to be learned.

If anyone wants to setup a mailing list for TeX-related
discussions, please do so.

Actually we need opposing view points to keep the debate going and to
push us to excel at reasoned thinking and expression of those
thoughts. But sometimes we also need to walk away for a while in order
to cool those heads from heated debate.

And I liked your classes to Mike, Wish I had the money to take nothing

Can you provide some more details? Pine doesn't actually "receive"
mail; it just reads it. So, are you

1) reading a local spool file directly?
2) using imap?
3) reading folders via nfs?
4) something different from 1-3?

Actually, Dell's Inspirons have had a few options for a while now...
depending on the model, you can use Intel integrated graphics, ATi
graphics, or nVidia graphics.  I chose nVidia GeForce2 Go for my i2650
about a year ago.

My friend has an ATi chip in his i8600, IIRC.

The 'super small' laptops tend to go with the Intel chips, though...
ugh.

Sorry I can't help the OP with his Intel graphics chip, I rarely play
with anything except nVidia graphics these days.

Wil's answer is the most general, and the one I would have posted had
he not done it first. Since he did the basic work, however, I'm free
to post some, er, idiosyncratic answers:

* More specifically:

  grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo

* More obscurely, Red Hat style:

  rpm --eval %_smp_mflags | sed 's![^0-9]!!g'

* One-liner:

  ps auxw | grep -c 'ksoftirqd_CPU[0-9]'

* Obligatory Perl solution:

  head -n 1 /proc/interrupts | perl -nle 'print tr/C//'

Sorry. That doesn't tell me *how* pine is getting access to your
mailboxes.

How 'bout this. Do "less /var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME" on your server. Are
you seeing mail in less that you can't see in pine?

Another solution which may not be available in all distributions is to
type the 'top' command and examine the top of the screen to see if
activity is reported on more than 1 processor.

Ooh. I wish I'd thought of that. :-)

  As a more general use solution, I keep "xosview" running on my desktop.
It's an old application, but still a goodie.  The RPM is in the Redhat
distro, but doesn't install by default. 

  It shows separate status bars for CPU 0 and 1.  It's fun watching
non-threaded, CPU intensive, tasks bounce between CPU's as they runs.

In-Reply-To: <05AD3C7EEA42D311809300902785AC8A0559C767@eft01ms01.eft.fiserv.net>
Message-ID: <20030917215415.74226.qmail@web40804.mail.yahoo.com>

I want to put together a 2U rack-mounted server. Anyone know of a local
shop that sells rack-mounted cases? I build a system a few months ago,
but used an old rack-mounted case from an older computer, and had to do
some minor modifications to make it work.

I'd like the case to accept standard commodity components, such as a
standard ATX motherboard and power supply.

My rack is a Compaq.

I'm very happy with the server I built recently. Dual Xeon 1.8 GHz, 2
gigs, 2 120 gig IDE, mirrored, Red Hat 9. It cost me around 1/3 what it
would cost from Dell.

Thanks,

-Scott

http://www.processor.com has classified ads for this sort of equipment
as well as other stuff from laptops to "big iron." Of course, this is
not necessarily local.

okay, 
After getting all these wonderful clue bats, I realize I need to

The only way I could get an i845 to display an x-server is to use
framebuffer in the kernel and the fbdev driver in xfree86-4.  At least
it will do a better resolution than 680x480.

If you're using a stock kernel, it may already be compiled in.  I also
had to change color depth to 8 the first time I got it to start
successfully.

Good Luck,

Rob, and list,
I have a Dell Inspirion 2650 which has a nVidia GeForce2 Go and I forgot how
I implemented the nVidia driver. Can you help refresh my old, tired memory
on this process? I'm now using a RH 9.0 distri.

I've got a dual Xeon system, and doing a "cat /proc/cpuinfo" it shows
as four processors. This is because of Intel's "hyperthreading" which
is where one processor acts like it is two.

Yes.  Plenty of whitebox vendors use plain old boards in 1U and 2U
cases.  You have to get special riser boards to put cards in them, but
they're reasonably standard and can be had from a place like NWCA or
Fry's.

You're right, a standard ATX power supply would not fit in a 2U, but a
standard ATX mother board would work, with 90 degree PCI slot adapters.
I guess I would need a 3U or 4U then, unless the case comes with a good
quality power supply.

the Inspiron is anything but small - the battery alone is as heavy as my

My wife did her masters thesis in LyX.  For a hardcore LaTeX user, LyX
can be irritating because of what LaTeX capabilities you don't get,
but it's probably good for the "if it doesn't have a GUI then it must
be bad" types.  (I haven't seriously tried LyX for a few years, so for
all I know they could have improved.  The screenshots I've seen look
pretty impresssive.)

Or its clones, such as OpenOffice.

LaTeX is still the text processor of choice in some areas of academia,
especially math and CS.  (Though there is increasing pressure for
conferences to accept things in Word format.)

What I think is most funny is that LaTeX seems to be the text
processor of choice at Microsoft Research.  (A few years ago, MS
decided to set up a research lab, and went around buying up a lot of
big-name profs in areas like compilers.  Most of these people have
just continued their previous lines of research, which have led some

attached to a lot of papers in the big research conferences (such as
PLDI) so that academics wouldn't be able to diss them for not making

Thanks Galen; looks pretty informative.  I'm sure reading it will help
me get to sleep tonight :)  Anyone else not able to print page 7 on the
first doc?  I get errors in GhostScript and gv.  If I print-to-file 1-6
and 8-13, it works just fine.

It works in xpdf it seems (at least for me), you might give that one a
try.

Subject: [PLUG] Long Perl regex...
Message-ID: <47932.68.107.223.201.1063899364.squirrel@webmail.pdxlug.org>

I have 6 numbers that appear at the end of a line of text.  The 6 numbers
may or may not have spaces between each.  So, for example, I could have:

1 234 5 6
or
1234 56

I constructed the following regex to strip out the spaces:

$line =~
s/(.*)([0-9])\s?([0-9])\s?([0-9])\s?([0-9])\s?([0-9])\s?([0-9])\s?$/$2$3$4$5$6$7/;

This works, but it's long and I'm curious if there's a shorter, more
clever way.
Thanks,

You're right, a standard ATX power supply would not fit in a 2U, but a
standard ATX mother board would work, with 90 degree PCI slot adapters.
I guess I would need a 3U or 4U then, unless the case comes with a good
quality power supply.

  I was looking at 2U ATX chassis earlier this year.  They have great rack
density and price point if you're looking for cheap MIPS with few or no PCI
cards.

http://www.rackmount.com/Chassis.htm

  Of course, you get what you pay for.  This is all commodity class
hardware.  I was looking at building redundant servers.  I could afford to
lose a machine from time to time.  Mission critical services should still be
run on enterprise class hardware.

Interesting problem. I take it that the text preceding the six digits
is expendable, right?

For starters, ditch the character class and the opening grouping:

  s/^.*(\d)\s?(\d)\s?(\d)\s?(\d)\s?(\d)\s?(\d)\s?$/$1$2$3$4$5$6/;

Grouping would allow you to do it in two (shorter) steps:

  s/^.*(\d\s?\d\s?\d\s?\d\s?\d\s?\d)\s?$/$1/;
  s/\s//g;

This might buy you some maintainability, and it might even be faster,
since you're only producing $1, not $1 .. $7.

If you're up for it, you can make the second half of the regex
executable:

  sub nospace { my $x = shift; $x =~ s/\s//g; $x; }
  s/^.*((\d)\s?(\d)\s?(\d)\s?(\d)\s?(\d)\s?(\d))\s?$/nospace($1)/e;

But this doesn't buy you anything, and it's likely to be much slower
since you've got a subroutine call in every regex.

It looks like the two authoritative DNS servers for ftc.gov are handing
out different MX records.  doberman.ftc.gov lists two non-working mail
servers: saltydog and lobo.

What problem? Are you concerned that you're getting

I assign $1 to another variable to preserve the preceding text.

Thanks.  This is what I'll use (making a couple small changes to preserve

The 2003 Portland ITEC Show is December 10-11, 2003 at the
Oregon Convention Center. The show includes an Open Source
Pavilion where Linux/Open Source-focused companies can
participate at low cost (compared to the cost of normal
exhibit space). I'm handling the details of the Linux
Pavilion, so contact me for information or to sign up.

You can have 6 feet of table exhibit space for only $1000.
This also includes:

Company name listed on Portland ITEC web site
300 complimentary ITEC tickets for marketing purposes
ITEC e-ticket for marketing purposes
Open Source Pavilion banner above exhibit space
Carpet
Chair
Electricity

Note that normal exhibit space costs $2,195 per 10x10.
For small companies that can't afford the $1000, I'll be
coordinating the sharing of table space.

The Open Source Pavilion will be marketed on every ITEC
medium available (direct mail, email, e-tickets, hard tickets,
local Business Journal, etc.) ITEC expects to attract over
5,000 attendees.

Call me at 503-635-6370 for more information or to sign up.

ftc.gov mail is handled by 10 arcticfox.ftc.gov.
ftc.gov mail is handled by 10 silverfox.ftc.gov.
ftc.gov mail is handled by 20 redfox.ftc.gov.
[bigfish at kippered bigfish]$ mailq
/var/spool/mqueue is empty

  What Microsoft virus is running rampant today? I've received over a dozen
virus-attachment-infected messages, generally coming in pairs, that have the
body text related to undeliverable messages.

  Has anyone else been pestered with these?

Some would argue that they "went out of business" when bought by that
canadian company some years back.  I've posted here and on usenet
about that before.  Apparently, that canaadian company has now also
gone belly up.  Bye bye "inetarena.com".

Richard,

Here are the latest viruses found in the last 24 hours:

  W32.Swen.A at mm
  W32.Yaha.AB at mm
  W32.Moks
  W32.HLLW.Gaobot.AF
  Backdoor.IRC.RPCBot.F
  W32.Vybab at mm

Check sarc.com, do a search there to find out which one is pestering
you.

I'm just glad that Sobig.F finally took a break. We received 24,000
Sobig-infected emails in the past few weeks, but it has been tapering
off, and none have hit our mail server this week. That's not counting
the many thousands of emails from stupid postmasters telling me our
servers sent it to them, ignorant of the fact that Sobig.F spoofs the
sender email address.

-Scott

Is this always six numbers and always last?

Assume your sting is $line.

my $foo = $line;

$foo =~ s/\s//g;

$foo = substr($foo,-6,6);

Doesn't that work?

Or, in a readable language, and without using regexes:

#!/usr/bin/python
# get your string from somewhere, save it in variable line

i=0, end=-1, numbers=""
while i < 6:
    if line[end] != " ":
        numbers = numbers + line[end]
        i = i + 1
    end = end - 1

Of course, you never said anything about this either running incredibly
quickly (this is okay, but poky compared to a regex) or that spaces were
the only non-numeric characters in the midst of those numbers. Plus you
wanted to put it in a bash script.

But I'm just having fun. =)

It's faster to do a join on a list than to concatenate strings, if
you're doing it a lot.

That's part of the allure of the *nix culture. You can approach
problems with a variety of toolsets, combining them playfully. The
long-term benefit of that culture is that its members become
producers, not consumers, of the solutions.

I don't know the source of the old quip, but it seems to apply
somehow: "A football game is 50,000 spectators who desperately need
exercise sitting in the stands watching 22 men on the field who
desperately need rest."

It's only the folks who play who get any real benefit out the game;
for the rest, it's just a passing entertainment.

Message-ID: <1063917422.6224.37.camel@localhost>

folks,

is there a clinic on Saturday? Where? And finally, I have a very
hardware-sick computer that I would like to bring, and was hoping
someone might be bringing expertise and maybe a few parts to swap in for
testing, or an actual testing device. 

The computer, which does not POST, is an AMD T-Bird 900 or 1100 mhz
(forget), but 200 mhz fsb, with 133 mhz SDRAM. The motherboard was made
by Soyo.

Here is a handy way to obtain current viri information if you host a web
site or intranet.  Paste the following into a page, create the link to
that page and there you go.  Instant information from symantec's virus
notification.

  Many thanks. In pine I see only that there's an attachment of type
'audio'. There may be a one-line message, but that's it.

  These have no effect here other than the wasted time of reporting the
spammers to the sending ISP.

Cool... didn't know Norton was doing that, too.

FreeGeek has been getting a number of higher end, (900mhz), machines that 
will not post. MOST of them have bad capacitors. Look on your motherboard 
for the largest cylinders. If they are poofed up on top or have dried goo 
near the bottom you may be able to salvage it,

Apologies for the break in the thread.

I stumbled into rpmseek.com (Get it? Find and seek?) Oh, never mind.
Anyway, it looks interesting. I was turned on to it since they track
.deb's now too.

  No. That's what I have installed. I'd like a newer version. To install
that I need three dependencies to be fulfilled. The first dependency is
gimp-print-devel. However, to build that from the src.rpm, I need
ghostscript-devel, which I cannot access until I rebuild ghostscript, which
I cannot do until the gimp-print-devel dependency is satisfied, ...

  An infinite loop.

Hello,

I'm looking for a SMART HD client.  I had some I/O errors today and with all the
talk about using SMART to assess the state of the HD I would like to check the SMART
settings.  Does anyone know where I can get one?  Is it built into linux?  I have RH
7.3.

Also, without opening the computer how do I find out what HD I have in the machine.
It has been like 4 years or longer.  I really don't know.

Thanks,

Josh

Install the kernel-utils RPM.  It contains smartctl, smartd, and other

Thanks.  Now I'll just go learn how to read the SMART output.

I don't usually sell piece-parts, but I'm always interested in seeing
new cases. I could order either of these Antec cases:

So, I've tried to find some good information on how to run the SMART tools but only
find the command line docs.  They do not tell me how to read the output and where
the log files are stored. It appears on my newer drive the error logs are stored
internal to the HD.  Is this true?  Is there a log file for smartctl commands that
happen?

It also appears that the smartmontools project are better tools.  Does anyone know
about these?  Should I install those?  I don't see any way to test the drive while
there are mounted partitions.  Or so it seems.  I may be confused here just want
some good pointers if someone knows.

Thanks,

Josh

I just installed the tools (I'm in Debian-land, so it was an apt-get)
and typed:

  smartctl -a /dev/hda | less

On my Gentoo box (definitely not Debian) it was smartmontools... and
their website matches, IIRC... smartmontools.sf.net.

Not unless you're using a prepackaged kernel maintained by someone who
cares to set such things.

My favorite way to see how many active processors you've got is to set the
thing to boot with framebuffer consoles and count the penguins!

Yes I can run this command and get a report but the one drive does not have an error
log in the report because it says "

Device does not support Error Logging
Device does not support Self Test Logging


So, is there another way to test that drive for errors?  I saw something like fsck
-c /dev/hda1 will do some error checking but thought SMART would be a better way. 
Perhaps rebuilding the server is in order.  But that will have to wait a few weeks. 
Just want some assurance that the drive will last three more weeks.

uname -p might do the trick though.  I'm on a single proc right now, but 
since it's telling me what type of proc I've got, I'm thinking it might 
tell me if SMP is enabled.  Though it might do that even if I don't have 
dual.  Either someone will correct me, or I'll check from work.

fwiw, itt doesn't do anything for me. On my dual-PIII, it reads,

Aye, and in reviewing this thread I realized that 1.) "uname -r" is redhat 
specifc, which the OP said was the distribution being used, and 2.) it's 
only indicative of the kernel loaded and not the fact that both processers 
are enabled.

Nifty, but as long as its not too cute.  Cute becomes annoying in a very

Subject: [PLUG] transferring Mozilla email
Message-ID: <1063987125.7560.9.camel@osca>

Hello,

My primary email client is Mozilla running on my Windows laptop. Trouble
is, after a few months I get so much email & so many attachments that
Mozilla gets sluggish.  I moved my email directory to my Unix
workstation, which has 16+ Gig of RAM. I installed Mozilla on the Unix
workstation and muddled through getting it to read my email from the
laptop, with all folders preserved.  Despite the volume of email, the
workstation handles it easily, allowing searches, i.e. of text in the
body of an email message, that would cause my laptop Mozilla to hang.

Trouble is, I need to keep using my laptop as my primary email client
because I travel with it and plug it into the company network at remote
company sites or access email via my DSL at home.  How can I concatinate
the latest batch of laptop email to the email directory I've set up on
my Solaris workstation?  The email appears to be saved in text format
with some embedded binary encoding for attachments.  Can I simply
concatinate each email file from the laptop at the bottom of the
corresponding file on the workstation?

Thanks,

Dave Bienvenu

P.S. I have about 20 email folders set up that I need to preserve.

I'm not sure what they did. I do know that Oregon State (orst.edu) removed some of the archives they had. Broke my mirror scripts...

I use an IMAP pipe through a ssh connection. 

Alternatively, you could set up the windows box to get pop mail, but don't delete it from the server on the Windows box. When you get the mail on the Solaris machine, it will remove the mail from the server. 

The advantage of the IMAP method is both machines see the same mail spool/archive.

Well, it turns out uname -v will tell you if you have SMP enabled
and /proc/cpuinfo to find out the number reported.  With hyperthreading that
will double the number.

Message-ID: <5.2.0.9.0.20030915155706.023bcec0@www.hotsushi.com>

Hi,

Fall term starts next Monday and there are two Linux classes at PCC.

CIS240L is a Linux Installation and Configuration class covering the main 
tasks involved in setting up and administering a stand alone Linux 
box.  You should have a basic understanding of a *nix file system and basic 
command line utilities.  Two sections are offered, one on the Internet and 
one that meets at Sylvania from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Monday nights.

CIS279L is a Linux Networking class covering TCP/IP plus network utilities, 
applications (NFS, Samba, DNS, DHCP, Apache, Sendmail, Postfix, etc.), 
troubleshooting and an introduction to security. One section is offered 
from 2 PM to 4 PM, Tuesday and Thursday.

Both classes are command line oriented and have lots of hands on labs.

Both classes

Go to www.pcc.edu and register online or just come to class and we'll 
figure it out from there.

Please e-mail me off list for more details or questions.

Thanks,
Mike Neal

I agree we should get involved in this, and I think Linux can probably
provide a good solution once we know the requirements.  Web browsing
services are trivial, of course.  Regarding the card catalogs, surely
someone else has already wrestled with this problem, either victoriously or
otherwise.  I think we need to make contact with the Library staff, find out
what the requirements are, and then do some research on what's already been
done before we try to reinvent the wheel.

Possibly related, Ed Sawicki is part of a new venture in which they have
customized the kernel to provide a "sealed system".  The basic idea is that
the O/S has an area (probably a partition) for binaries and such that it
will refuse to update.  This is supposed make it highly resistant to
viruses, user tampering, etc.  This also makes it very easy to lock down the
systems.  I'm not sure if we need this, but it might be valuable in a
public-computer setting.  It might increase the Library's costs, but Ed may
be willing to make some sort of arrangement in exchange for exposure,
advertising rights, etc.  Ed, obviously, can explain his product and it's
benefits better than I.

folks,

is there a clinic on Saturday? Where? And finally, I have a very

someone might be bringing expertise and maybe a few parts to swap in for
testing, or an actual testing device. 

The computer, which does not POST, is an AMD T-Bird 900 or 1100 mhz
(forget), but 200 mhz fsb, with 133 mhz SDRAM. The motherboard was made
by Soyo.

Pardon the possible duplicate message. I didn't see the
first one come through.

I'm putting together the sessions for the Linux/Open Source
track at the ITEC show. The sessions are geared to people
who are fairly new to Linux and Open Source - not to the
experts on this list. With this in mind, I'm interested in
your opinions about the subjects Linux newbies should be
told about.

We're limited to four 1-hour sessions so apologies in advance
if I don't use your suggestion no matter how good it is.

Rich is right. The Clinic is September 20th. One of these days I'm going

Hi All,
	I saw this article posted on /. and was hoping to find some help.
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-boot.html
	The article is good about explaining how things work currently but I'm
having trouble implementing it. I've looked through the code and the
article. I'm not sure where the files belong or what all needs to be
included in the start/stop.mk files. I am running MDK cooker (soon to be
9.2).

TIA,

Is the mail spool lost--should we resend stuff that never made it to the

Riverdale HS has 100Mbps to me (MESD), but we currently have a bottleneck
of a measly 50Mbps from MESD to the internet. We're working on fixing
that ;-)

Relax & have a home brew. Your mail server will keep trying to send
the mail to the list for at least 48 hours (assuming you have a 
reasonable mail exchanger & the destination's mail exchanger has the
proper DNS records).

It may take an hour or two, however. Expect PLUG mail to trickle in
slowly and in an odd order. If you have a second homebrew, it might
not seem so odd ;-)

I haven't used the program but is there an option for running self test?
Error Logging and Self Test Logging are newer options.

If smartctl doesn't dump stuff in a user readable format then I might have
to
hack something into it.  I don't thing there is any active development on
it.

If you're going to try to do this to your system, you should really
understand 'make' first.  O'Reilly has a pretty good book about it.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0309191951540.20997@shaft.bitmine.net>

OK, I have a mail server at a remote site that is configured as the mail
host for several domains.  Authenticated ESMTP and IMAP and POP3 all seem
to work just dandily (SSL comes later).

HOWEVER...

One domain just doesn't want to work correctly.  The error message seems
to keep changing, though.

When I send mail to one of the domains from anywhere on the net, the
message is delivered fine.

But when I send mail to another domain, I get an error (more on that in a
moment).  However, I DO NOT get this error when I send from my home
machine and some few spammers seem to get through.

Roughly, the mail configuration follows the one described here:
<URL: http://www.marlow.dk/tech/postfix.php >

At first, the rejected mail was coming back with "553, sorry, that domain
is in my list of allowed rcpthosts" or similar.  So I made some changes to
the postfix_access table, that did nothing.  So I removed all entries from
that table... now the error message has changed and everything else
continues on in the same way.

550:  The domain to which you are trying to send does not exist.

Or words to that effect.

Near as I can tell, the domains are configured identically... and, again,
they BOTH WORK FINE when I mail from here (brelin.net, my house).

Ed,

A co-worker of mine is learning linux from an administration point of view.  My
first question to you would be if this was intended for end-users or Admins.  This
would help you determine what section is more important to teach in your 4 hours.

I'm guessing that you are thinking end-users.  In that case, the basics of KDE/GNOME
or some window manager is always the best and less threatening to anyone.  You could
show them the CLI as well.  In fact, I was just showing another admin how you set
things executible from the CLI yesterday.  He thought it was funny you needed to
know what the bits meant.  Which is true.

None the less, I would first decide which users you plan to address and then set up
a small good to know information.  Most end-users will want to know how to open a
file.  Where the editor is.  And many, how to run their application tool.  While the
admins should learn the basics of where files are installed and the file system
structure.

Josh

HA!

I found it!

I started reading PLUG to clear my head and NOT think about my mail
problem and I read the thread about mail to uce at ftc.gov not going through
properly... and then y'all go on to talk about the output for `host -t mx`
for the domain.

So I check the MX records on these domains, and SURE ENOUGH, the failing
domain has the wrong mail exchanger... and the MX host is a hostname that
resolves to the right address on my network, but not to the outside world!

I'm SURE that's going to solve it.

Is this going to take time to propogate?

Are you looking only for ideas or are you looking for presenters too? 
Are you looking more for tutorial how-to stuff, or broader descriptions
of the things one can do with open source software?

Mozilla stores mail folders in the plain text mbox format.  The .msf 
files are temporary indexes and are reconstructed as needed.  I had no 
trouble copying all the files from Windows to Linux when I migrated my 
home machine.  You might have trouble keeping the two machines synchronized.

Ahh, I misread the problem.  I'd write that as:

my $nums = $line;
$nums =~ tr/0-9//cd;
substr($nums, 0, -6) = "";

AFAIK only as long as it takes DNS servers that cached your domain's
record to refresh them (Max of your TTL).

Although, I should preface that with I haven't a great understanding of
DNS just yet... I muddled through the DNS HOWTO and have a BIND server
acting as primary or backup DNS for my few domains, but beyond the 'how
do I get it working from example XXXX' I'm not really doing that great
yet.  :-)

(need to find some online DNS info, methinks)

After having had my prejudices against IDE drives confirmed by Larry and
the papers Galen posted, I'm wondering where SATA drives fall.  I'm
seeing them offered in a lot of higher-end systems and with RAID
controllers and they're only slightly less expensive than SCSI.  I don't
know much about them, other than they're somehow ATA interfaces adapted
to a serial bus, like SSA or FCAL.  Are they being designed and
manufactured as Enterprise Storage devices, or Personal Storage?  Are
they so expensive just because they're still new?

Hopefully a quick one.  Searching "man bash" and the O'Reilly book haven't 
come up with an answer.

Can one do a substitution on the current command line to the effect of

But it is the previous command.  I did find that if the command line 
contained a ";" that the substitution only proceeds up to that ";".

It looks like there are both enterprise and consumer SATA hard drives 
available.  The consumer ones are more common; they are 7200 RPM with 
80, 120, 180, etc sizes.  WD is selling a 36 GB, 10000 RPM ones 
described as Enterprise SATA.  The prices for the consumer SATA drives 
are only slightly more expensive ($10-30) than the equivalent IDE ones.

Is there a tool to search the archives? I do not find one on the site.

I've tried several times to search for old discussions, this time for cheap 
domain registrars, (I know we thrashed this one to death) and google finds 
nothing at pdxlinux.org but all of the on-line docs, nothing at all at 
http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/

Does anyone keep the archives on line in a searchable format anywhere? Does 
anyone have them handy so I could put them on line?

Sorry, I'm frustrated. Nothing promotes wasted time like unaccessable

I am not sure if there is currently a better method, but you've at
least got grep.  Just grab:

  <http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug.mbox/plug.mbox>

and away you go (at least back to about February 2002).  It's only
about 67 meg.  ;-)

I've personally accumulated raw data (thanks to generous
contributions) for the main PLUG list going back much further (with a
smattering of coverage back to at least mid-1995), but haven't
mustered the energy to finish cleaning it up.

He's biased against non-openness of either codebase or protocol.  I think
that's a reasonable bias to hold.

He doesn't just have a meaningless grudge.

How is DJB's license NOT proprietary?  Can I make changes and distribute
them without DJB's permission?  Then it's his property... proprietary to
him.

Standards are what keep the network sane.  Interoperability should be the
number ONE goal of networking software (ahead of security, ease of use, or
efficiency).  It's about communicating, brother.

Message-ID: <03092113491500.07603@gate>

Hello Linux folkz,
I've just installed a couple of WDE9150 Western Digital SCSI hard drives to 
build RAID5. 
To my suprise, each of these drives shows 2048GB of its capacity instead of 
real 9.1GB. Just for the sake of sanity I tried to install Linux on one of 
these drives. Installation failed with warnings related to some IO problems.
Could somebody tell me please if I have to perform low level formatting of 
these SCSI drives before building RAID5, or these drives just defective and 
I'll have exchange them and bit crap out of vendor.
Thank you very much in advance for any help or source of information.

Deliver it to a program?  Like pipe it to something?

I think the way to do it is to put a .forward in that address' home
directory with the single line:

|/some/program/somewhere

Unless I misunderatnd your question... in which case I apologize.

Doesn't postfix use the same /etc/aliases syntax as sendmail?

address_alias:  "|/path/to/program"

You don't need a real user for that.

No, you understand, and that sounds like a pretty simple way to do it,
but I don't want to have to create a user for each email address I want
to have.

I understand now.  :-)

I'm pretty sure Jeme's method is the way to do it.  If that doesn't
work, I'll go googling.

That's the way to do it, but you may have to create a new aliases hash or
something.  Depends on how you've got your aliases loading in your
main.cf.

If you're doing virtual hosting, it's a bit trickier.  You have to
redirect the virtual address to a local alias and then set the local alias
to deliver to a pipe.

It sounds like your SCSI controller may be helpfully limiting your drive
capacity.  I'd check your controller settings or try a different one.

Low-level formatting is very seldom needed.

ATA 4 drives will allow you to monitor smart but not with the detail that
later drives provide.

The ATA 4 spec did not include the Error Logging pages.
ATA 5 rev 1.0 did and it seemed (by the date on the doc) that
it was released in May 1999.  Drives produced prior to this could
have supported it but would have been non-standard.

The ATA spec is currently at ATA6.  ATA7 seems to be in review.
For your bedtime reading here is the standards web site for ATA spec.

I use the rename command. For example, my camera names files something
like DSCP000001.JPG, DSCP000002.JPG, etc. If these photos were from a
camping trip in, I might want them to be renamed camping_2003_01.jpg,
etc. This command would do them all in this fashion:

  rename "DSCP0000" "camping_2003_" *.JPG

One weirdness of the rename command... case pseudo-insensitivity. I
prefer all lowercase filenames on my web pages, so I like to rename
.JPG to .jpg. But if you try to rename ".JPG" to ".jpg" it will not see
the difference, and do nothing. To work around this, I'll first change
".JPG" to ".xxx", then change ".xxx" ".jpg".

  I suspect that the only way to print a pdf file is to display it in xpdf
or acroread and print it from there. Is there a one-step means of printing
the file directly from the command line?

  Yes, I could run it through pdf2ps then print the resulting postscript
file, but that puts another, much larger, file on the disk. I'd like to feed
output directly to the printer.

Just curious,

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe rename takes a perl
reg. to perform the substitution.  This should work (although I can't
test it at the moment):

rename 's/\.JPG/\.jpg/' *

or, more generally:

rename 's/\.[jJ][pP][gG]/\.jpg/' *

  pdf2ps file.pdf - | lpr

Specifying an output file of '-' sends output to stdout, which is then
piped to lpr, which by default sends its stdin to the printer.

Sounds like probably dynix.  (In fact, I'm pretty sure it is.  If we are
talking about the Beaverton library, I know the director.  Used to be my
boss, in fact.  Very cool, smart guy.  Was sad to see him move on.)  I
remember him saying that he wasn't very impressed with dynix (or whatever
they have), but that's what was there when he got there.  (I'm not familiar
with it myself, so I can't help much more there.)


But I can give you plenty of background info as far as what is involved in
running library systems in general, and the kinds of things you'll find in
the library market. So here goes...


Library automation software (what you are thinking of as the catalog,
but it is far more than that) is usually a very large investment.  High 5
figures at least.  Migrating from one to another is a pretty drastic
financial decision, and migrating is a major project.  It's like a heart
transplant for the library... even when fully smooth and successful there
will be repurcussions for a long time afterward.  Months, or even a year.
I've done 2.

As far a linux goes, there's two different aspects.  One is as a platform
for the LAS to run on.

Myself (and many other admins) have been working on trying to convince our
respective vendors that we'd like to see linux available as a platform
option for a number of years now.  (Going back 5 years at least.)  But they
all seem slow to adopt any new platforms.  Even NT/Win2K was slow to be
taken up, even with as many requests as they got from their customer base. 
(Mostly admin-less libraries were asking for that.)  -- Interestingly
enough, most of the ones that run on windows don't even use the Win32
subsystem or hardly anything beyond the kernel and tcp stack at all. 
They're sitting on posix or even cygwin.  You can strip the machine away to
practically nothing, and are far more stable than any other windows servers
I've ever seen. :)  Anyway, more traditionally they are Solaris, AIX, HP-UX,
etc.  Heck, the one we had forever was MPE/iX (HP3000 series).  It all
depends on the vendor.  You pick the software, THEN you pick an available
platform... Not the other way around.  But dammit, we've been asking for a
linux option for years.  They're starting to get softer on the idea as time
goes on, so eventually I'm sure we'll have it.

Here is a list of LAS vendors: http://libinfo.com/vendors-systems.html

Some of them I've never even heard of.  Here are some major players everyone
seems to know about.  Google should tell you more:

Ameritech Library Systems
- Dynix
- Horizon

Sirsi Corporation (of note: swallowed major competitor DRA a year ago)
- Unicorn (Sirsi's flagship LAS)
- Taos (was DRA flagship, being phased out and absorbed into Unicorn)
- DRA Classic (legacy)
- MultiLIS (legacy)
- Inlex (legacy)

Gaylord
- Polaris

III
The Library Corporation (TLC Carl)
Innovative


The other aspect of course, would be an open source library automation
system.  There are actually a number of projects dedicated to that purpose,
in various states of completion.  But none of them are anywhere near being
replacements for existing, establishes LAS's.  Yet.  There is one that is at
a point where it could be a choice for a small library that has never had
any automation before... And that is the niche it is currently filling. 
Many MLS (actual librarians - Masters in Library Science degrees and all of
that) types that are programmers are working on bits and pieces that may
eventually fill in the gaps and provide a base for a full system to be built
on.  (Sort of like the GNU compiler and tools had to be there before
building anything else useful on top of them.)  I fully believe we'll have
one someday, but it is a long way off.  

Another note... Any web-based OPAC is usually somewhat tied to the LAS.  You can't
get away with setting up the Apache/linux box for to handle it, because
it'll probably need to run binary cgi's provided by the vendor in order to
interoperate.  Although many nowadays will let you choose which webserver
software you like.  And Apache will work, of course.


> I think Linux can probably provide a good solution once we know the
requirements.

The area most primed for some linux solutions is the public workstations. 
(As you've probably guessed, and seem to be focusing on anyway.  That's
good.)

I'm not going to go on about what might or might not work in a public
environment...  I'm sure any talented person can figure that out.




But here are some things that might be hangups, or things to watch out for:

- Of course, the setup needs to be as indesctructible and locked down as
possible.  Allow the user to do everything they need to do, but nothing they
don't.  The basic requirement is that when they log out (or otherwise tell
the machine they are finished) the machine should remain exactly as it was
before they started.  So that the next patrons has the same fully functional
not-screwed-up-by-someone-else mahine that the first got.

- Patrons will want to save stuff on disks.  Mounting/unmounting will need
to be automatic.

- The library probably has metering/tracking software of some kind.  This
stuff simply keeps counts of application usage (like simple tickmarks... Not
"who used what").  This is needed for statistical purposes (which in turn
means budget).  You know, to show that your services are actually being
used.  State reports want that info, too.

- They might also have a system where authentication to use the machine is
dependent on their library card number.  (Or a guest pass).  Which means
authenticating against the LAS somehow.  (Or simply against a text file
generated by a report on the LAS, and staged where accessible to the public
machine authentication system.  This is an old trick to avoid paying the
astronomical amounts of money vendors seem to want for a "patron
authentication server".  Which is is an LAS service designed to answer
authentication queries from 3rd party software. Grrr.)  In addition, there
may be time-limits involved.  Which can vary wildly.  (Certain machines may
have different time-limits.  Others may have none.  Patrons may be allowed a
certain amount of time for every individual machine, or category of
machines, etc.  Maybe a single time limit for usage of all computers usage. 
Or a nifty combination of all of the above.  15 minutes on those, 1 hour on
these, and 4 on those.  But never to exceed a grand total of 4.)  Lastly,
routing internet access through proxies etc may also depend on the patrons
age.  You can guess what that all means.

- There may be database or reasearch applications (things like encarta,
world book, and many library market stuff you may have never heard of) that
simply require their own windows client program.  End of story.  Sucks, but
all too true.  If it can be run in WINE, great.  If not, you're screwed. 
Unless they can be relegated to a few windows machines, while the others go
linux.  This is less of a problem than it used to be, though.  More and more
of these types of programs and services are becoming web-based all the time. 
Which is great for many reasons.  One is platform independence.  The other
is less work.  (The library doesn't have to run around anywhere updating
that data quarterly, monthly, or whatever.)

- Print control!  Some libraries control print costs by charging patrons for
pages printed beyond a certain amount.  Many do this in a low-tech fashion
(either honor system, or make you have to physically retrieve the pages from
a librarian).  But there are a lot of ways this is handled electronically. 
Sometimes tied to your library account, sometimes separate.  At any rate,
many libraries will need a print cost management system.

A lot of these issues are currently handled by software available for
windows desktops.  So if proposing switching them to another platform,
you'll need to be prepared to address them as well.

That's all I can think of at the moment.  I'm sure there's more, but those
are the biggies that spring to mind.  (Note: we don't necessarily do all of
that here.  But all libraries are different, and those are some of the
things you may find.)



> Regarding the card catalogs, surely someone else has already wrestled with
this problem,

There are going to be a few different catagories of access to the LAS.  When
you are referring to the card catalog, you are probably meaning the
interface that the public uses to search it for what they want.  Perhaps
also to place holds, renew items, etc.  This is usually called the OPAC. 
(Online Public Access Catalog.)  Most of them are web based nowadays, and
they don?t tend to be very browser specific.  A stripped and locked down
browser-only linux box that can only access a single site (the catalog)
would go a long way in that market.

The other interfaces are going to be what the staff uses for circulation,
cataloging, report building, acquisitions, configuration (policies, staff
accounts and access, patron account management, circ maps, hold filling
behavior, etc, etc), and maintenance utilities.  Sometimes they are all
accessible from one app, some systems have separate apps.  Unfortunately the
vast majority of these are going to be windows apps.  Perhaps WINE would be
able to run some of them.

> I think we need to make contact with the Library staff, find out
what the requirements are, and then do some research on what's already been
done before we try to reinvent the wheel.

There you go.  I'd love to see linux solutions available for the libraries. 
It'd be more stable, less work (less time fixing problems = more time to
improve services), and less cost in the long run.  I know other library
geeks that would love nothing more than to rip windows systems out and put
linux boxes in their place.  It's just that some of the stuff we need isn't
available, or just simply hasn't been put together with the parts that are
there.  And I certainly don?t have time to work on it.  (I'm taking enough
time just pounding out this email as it is.)  I'd love nothing more than to
be able to kiss my windows boxes goodbye! :)

The latter I think.
We're assuming that the audience will be mostly Windows-centric
people. Historically, that is correct for ITEC. Therefore, we
want to present topics and do demonstrations that show these
people that Linux/Open Source-based systems (desktops and servers)
are better. 

We should focus on how Linux/OSS-based systems are secure,
reliable, low-cost, and can do cool things. For example, UMLs
allow things that Windows systems cannot do. X allows remote
desktops while Windows can only do this with (usually)
extra-cost software and per-seat licenses. The Windows NTFS
file system allows users/attackers to hide files from an
administrator, while Linux file systems cannot.

I'm thinking that instead of one speaker per session, we'll
have one main speaker that introduces other speakers who then
do short presentations and demonstrations on a particular
feature of Linux/OSS.

We're not going to go into a lot of technical detail in the 1-hour
sessions but there is time between sessions for people to ask the
Linux experts/enthusiasts in the room.

I think you're wrong.  Doesn't work on the RedHat 9.0 machine I just
tried; rename is a binary file.  You may be thinking of a small,
commonly-used perl script that behaves the way that you mention:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

$op = shift or die "Usage: rename expr [files]\n";
chomp(@ARGV = <STDIN>) unless @ARGV;
for (@ARGV) {
    $was = $_;

    rename($was,$_) unless $was eq $_;

Good to know!  Does anyone know of an advantage to the binary rename
command? I find the reg. exp's to be invaluable for complex renaming..

Um, aren't you using one of the automatic filters?  Foomatic, autofilter,
or the like will just plain do the right thing.

`lp file.pdf`

Of course, you won't get this because you plonked all my mail out of

anyway.

Bring five computers, five Knoppix CDs. Knoppix now has OpenMosix on it.
Put the computers on a network together, pop in the Knoppix CDs, watch
as you get instant cluster computer.

Scares the crap out of MCSEs every time.

You sound like an expert in this area.

Have you heard of the Koha project:

http://pate.eylerfamily.org/geek/Koha.html

Blurb from the koha page:

The Koha Project is a free library automation system. It was originally 
developed by Katipo Communications for the Horowhenua Library Trust. Since 
it's inception, it has been installed at a number of libraries around the 
world.

The guy who runs the Koha project (Pat Eyler) is up in Seattle.  I've met 
him a few times.

I want to alter the weighting of the tests spamassassin assesses when an
email fails one of it's tests.

I'm out of places to look...

Slightly aside: Red Hat's rename (/usr/bin/rename) comes as part of
the util-linux package, while Debian's appears to be part of the Perl
distribution. That'd explain the differences, for sure...

My son is at Lake Oswego's Forest Hills elementary. They use MS
Publisher to write text. 

Does any of you know why that would be a reasonable choice or how that
compares to something we could edit at home with OpenOffice? He is told
he can work at home if he had a computer and MS Publisher. 

Thanks!

As the many answers indicate, there are many solutions to this
problem.  

The one I adopted is just to create a new directory for each camera
download.  The directory is named with a date in YYYYMMDD format.  If
I download the camera more than once in a day, I append a letter 'b',
'c', 'd', and so on to distinguish them.  The camera seems to notice
when it's been cleared and starts renumbering from zero again.

In descending order of good taste and maintainability, try editing

* $HOME/.spamassassin/user_prefs
* <prefix>/spamassassin/user_prefs.template
* the actual rules file in <prefix>/spamassassin

On a Red Hat box, <prefix> == /usr/share; I can't speak for other
installations.

The Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf man/perldoc page will tell you how it's
done, but let's say that wanted to increase the point count for a
message containing the term 'viagra' in the subject line (rule name is
SUBJ_VIAGRA).

The default score is

  SUBJ_VIAGRA 2.896 2.592 1.878 3.482

To raise it to, say, 3.50 in all cases, then

  echo "score SUBJ_VIAGRA 3.50" >> $HOME/.spamassassin/user_prefs

Does that help?

to do it just for your account look in ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs you'll
find some examples I believe towards the end that look something like
this:

        score DISGUISE_PORN 4
        score HTML_FONT_COLOR_UNSAFE 5
        score MIME_HTML_ONLY 3
        score FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS 3

It's been a while since I've done any work in MS Publisher -- so my
recollections may not be up to date -- but I seem to recall that I
couldn't find any non-MS tool that would read and/or write .pub files.

If your son (Hi, T!) wants to work at home, he may be able to work in
an application that produces Word .doc files. I recall MS Publisher
could import them fairly well.

But once the text is in Publisher, afaik, there's no getting it back.

Adding an alias that pipes to a program works like a charm, sorta..  
The program runs fine from the command line when I pipe a raw email to
it but won't execute when invoked by postfix, bouncing back with this
message: "Command died with status 1:"

Does anybody know why this might be happening?

It sounds like your filter might be exiting with a non-zero return
value.  Try 'echo $?' right after running it by hand to see.  If that's
the case and the filter is written to return 1 on normal exit, you can
write a little shell wrapper that runs the program and checks it's
return value, returning 0 instead of 1 on normal exit.

I had something somewhat similar happen with an Ultra 60 system.  It was a 
refurbished machine, and the vendor had installed a 36GB IBM drive.
When I started installing Solaris 8, the drive was showing up as
~9GB.  It turns out that the drive had some sort of EDS disk type written
to the disk label.  Once I changed the type back to IBM and rewrote
the disk label, everything was back to normal.

Very nice. I wish I'd had those in my user_prefs. that would have been
pretty easy to spot. I've bumped a few, namely HTML_BUGS and the one
that specifies an email address inside a URL, those both come up a lot,
but they aren't getting caught with a setting of four.

Yep.  That's one of the ones I was referring to.  (Couldn't remember the
name).  That's the one that is the closest thing to a complete open source
LAS so far, and is usable by some libraries.

I should take a peak in that direction again... It's probably been a year
since I looked at it.

Perhaps the advantage is you don't need to know perl?

If you want to do more complex renaming than the perl rename
script can handle, I have a perl script
    http://canids.net/felix/cmv
that knows how to do tricks like
    cmv 'tr/xyz/yzx/' x y z
without losing any of the files.  You can also do tricks like
    cmv -d 's(-)(/)g' *
to split files into subdirectories.

Reminds me of learning Pascal in high school.  Was told I could work at home 
using Turbo Pascal on a Z80 while everyone else used Apple ]['s.  When the 
time came to turn in the database assignment, of course my code wouldn't run 
at school so I had to drag in my computer (8" drives, external pwr. supp., 
etc).  I was a stoner then and the teacher was pretty surprised that my 
assignment kicked so much ass.

One of the things I've noticed with "smartctl" is its limited support for
SCSI drives.  Larry mentioned in his presentation (a great one, BTW) that
most SCSI drives have additional diagnostics above and beyond SMART.
Unfortunately, I've been unable to find any information about standardized
diagnostics on SCSI drives aside from SMART.

Does anyone on the list (maybe even Larry) have suggestions on ways of
monitoring SCSI drives for impending failure?  Why is the SCSI support for
smartctl so limited?  Is this a limitation in the SMART implementaion for
SCSI drives, or just lack of coding within the smartctl application?

Pointers to more information are appreciated, particularly since smartctl
seems to be abandoned and poorly documented.  (Code is from Sep 2000, with
minor updates made Sep 2001. http://sourceforge.net/projects/smartsuite/)

There was an article several months ago on this.  The original program was 
either started in Australia and a big chunk of change provide by some 
libraries in the US or the other way around.  I can't think of the name of 
the project off the top of my head.  I'll do some looking shortly.

  However, the file size is 25M! I've tried loading it in xfig and tgif to

a very good job of manipulating the image without removing clarity or

  I know that some of you have extensive graphics experience so I'm looking
for advice on whether such a large file might contain bloat that could be
removed and, if so, how I would go about doing this.

Gerardo,

    We offer colo's but the base is $100 a month.  There are groups of users
using User-Mode Linux that allows multiple virtual machines of linux running
on one box (like VMWare or VirtualPC).  If you're just looking for an email
server and web server that would be prime.  If you're looking to host a HLDS
(Half Life or Unreall Tournament) or something you'd want your own dedicated
linux machine.

I found https://www.pdxcolo.net/ to be able to provide a co-op virtual colo
box pretty reasonable.

It bugs me sometimes when people respond by trying to redefine the
question instead of answering it.  So I'll save that for the end :)

The size isn't surprising.  It's easy to get a raster image from a
vector; going the other way is difficult even for trivial images.  I'm
not sure how you printed your PS file, but it likely contains nothing
but thousands of single-color entity descriptions.  Vector formats
aren't optimized for this:  the description for each pixel/line/entity
is very heavy compared with linear raster formats (e.g. TIFF).

> and if it's possible to reduce the size while not messing up the

You can rasterize it (going full-circle) or edit it by hand in a
vector-manipulation program (e.g. KIllustrator, or whatever it's
called now).  The first option is pointless, since you could trivially
get the original raster image (unless I'm wrong -- see below).  The
second option would take forever.

Most vector-manipulation programs have ways of simplifying images, and
I'm sure there are command-line tools available, but I've not seen any
that are very good.  Unless you're writing your own AI image-
recognition tool for this job you'll have a hard time of it.

I suspect you're right.

See up a couple paragraphs.  If there's a way I don't know of it.

It really sounds like you're making a lot of work for youself.  If you
only want the image all browsers I know of [that display images] will
let you save them individually.  If you're looking for a production
solution (i.e. many many images), 'wget' should do just what you want,
even if it's a dynamically-created image.

If it's something nastier, like an image displayed in Java or Flash,
then I bet you're going to be better off getting a screen dump than
doing through the print/parse routine.  Even screen dumps can be
automated.

HTH,

Randall

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0309222012540.16917-100000@k12linux.mesd.k12.or.us>

I was just checking out some of the images that Galileo took of volcanic
activity on Io[1], one of Jupiter's moons.

One of NASA's Jet Propulsion Labs pages[2] covers plumes, calderas, and
flows. The caption released with the image defines a caldera:
 
   What's a caldera? Calderas are large, usually roughly circular
   depressions that form by collapse over shallow magma chambers that
   have been partially emptied by volcanic eruptions.

So as far as I understand it, if you start off with a shallow base and
then spew toxic fumes/magma into the environment, structural integrity
will be compromised and the whole mess will collapse upon itself leaving
a big stinking hole in the ground. That is how a caldera is made.

On Earth the process is similiar, except you start off with a Caldera,
spew toxic fumes/magma, and have the whole mess collapse upon itself
leaving a big, stinking hole in the ground. Some observers have referred
to the results as a Santa Cruz.

This concludes today's science lesson.

As an undergrad, I had a part-time job in my university's library,
working in the card catalog.  When it was really a CARD catalog
(millions of cards in drawers).  The old ones were all done manually
(with typewriters).  At some point (I think 1973), they subscribed to
a service where they would send the LC numbers of all the books they
had recently ordered, and they would gat back standardized cards for
each book (usually around 5 cards per book, since there were author,
subject and title cards, plus a master card, for each).  Of course,
that made life much easier for everyone.

I'm wondering how this is done with online systems.  Does each OPAC
vendor have a service to update the databases automatically?  Or are
there centralized servers, with the OPAC vendors providing import
tools.  And is the info in an open-enough format that an open-source
version could be made?

(BTW, relying on outside sources for cataloging information had the
downside that the "authoritative" sources of information were
sometimes just plain stupid.  My #1 complaint at both the McGill and
U. of Delaware libraries was that different years of the same computer
conference would be scattered about willy-nilly all over the QA range
(if you were lucky enough that they didn't put some in the TK area).
Which would be a royal PITA if, say, you wanted to browse all the PLDI
proceedings because you heard of a paper by Prof. Smith in PLDI but
you didn't know which year.  When I complained that the first three
years of the HPCA conference were in THREE DIFFERENT PLACES, the
librarian told me, "that's how the Library of Congress did it."  I
asked if the LoC hired rejects from the Patent office; she didn't get
the joke.)

Easy, but risks comtamination by viruses.  (Though most of them will
probably be DOS or Windows viruses, so no problem.)

I think VNC could be useful.  Though I don't know if it is possible to
have more than one person logged into NT at a time over VNC.
Certainly the other way (multiple people on Windows logged into a
Linux box via VNC) works fine.

Anyway, why is the school demanding work be in some proprietary format
(and a less common one at that)?  Do lots of people have MS Publisher
at home?  Why won't they accept PDF, or PS or HTML?  Aren't there any

IIRC, this is true. It's the moral equivalent of M$Works spread sheets,

Nope. It's got all kinds of other formatting stuff in it. If one copied
and pasted the text into word, it will do it.

I don't know if there are enough mac users or not, but even Win users
should complain. M$Pub is not the right tool to do anything other than
layout existing text in for newspapers and newsletters.

Not only is it a bod tool to teach kids to word process in, it's a
pretty poor tool in it's own right. 

Publisher is avail on it's own, and it's in some of the Office bundles,
(there are several. some include Access, most do not, some include
FrontPage, most do not...) only two of the five I'm aware of.

Some thing is rotten in Denmark, especially if she's not in a yearbook
or newspaper class...

FWIW, I taught M$ Office to 7th through 11th graders. 

My 2 cents.

Message-ID: <51395.68.107.223.201.1064337794.squirrel@webmail.pdxlug.org>

I have a Perl function that takes an array of the alphabet, does some
stuff, and if a certain criteria is met then it calls itself again and
adds another letter to the array.  So for example, this might occur:

a...
[some criteria met]
aa...
ab...
ac...
[some criteria met]
aca...
acb...
acc...
[some criteria met]
acca...
accb...
...
accz
acd...
...
acz...
ad...
ae...
...
az...
b...

And so on...  Sometimes the script dies for reasons that I'm unable to
control and I'd like to be able to start up the script and have it
continue on with wherever it was in the recursive process.  Any
suggestions?
Thanks,
~M

This is sort of a deep structural question.

There are several workable designs, but I think they depend heavily on how
the string relates to the conditions you're trying to meet, how the data
is stored internally and externally, and whether or not you care about
speed.

This is a totally unhelpful email, but if you were more specific, I could
probably be helpful.

Here's some sample code.  My goal is to be able to restart the script and
pick up where I left off, if say, we're deep in a recursion with letters
abcdefg when the script dies.


recurse_letters('a'..'z');

sub recurse_letters {
   foreach $letter (@_) {
      do_stuff_here;
      if ($something == 1000) {
         my @letters = ();
         foreach $newletter ('a'..'z') {
            push @letters, $letter . $newletter;
         }
         print "\@letters is now @letters\n";
         recurse_letters(@letters);
      } elsif ($something == 0) {
         shift @letters;
      } else {
         print "Processing $letter\n";
         shift @letters;
         do_other_stuff_here;

I'd rewrite it without recursion.  Explicitly represent the
current state of the script as a data structure.  Data structures
are easy to save/restore.

something like
    $tasks->push('a'..'z');
    while (!$tasks->empty()) {
        my $task = $tasks->pop();
        my @more = run($task);
        if (@more) {
            $tasks->push(@more);
        }
        $tasks->save()
    }

Pretty much.  OCLC is a big one.  (LC is a source also.)  I'm not a
librarian, so I'm not completely familiar with what they actually do.  (A
lot of stuff, beyond the scope of this).  Here's my oversimplified (and
possibly not-quite-accurate) summary.  Basically, member libraries
download bibliographic records, make some adjustments to them to reflect
local organization and usage, then import them into their own system. If
a record doesn't exist for an item, they will just create one, and
send it in.  It is probably stamped for approval at some point, and is then
available to everyone.  You could probably draw some analogies between these
types of services and CDDB type services.

> version could be made?

Version of what?  Central databases?  Or the data itself?

I can tell you that here they log into OCLC via a terminal program (provided
by OCLC) and work with records within their system.  When the cataloger is
finished with a batch of records, they are downloaded to a local file.  We
send that over to our system and import it.

The data is in MARC format, which is a standard.  I'm iffy on the finer
details, but MARC is a standard for both the organization of the
data (logically) and of the files themselves.  They're raw data files that
one can pick through and read with a text editor, but you wouldn't really
want to work with them that way.  There are lots of tools that can convert
them into plain text and back again, and others that let you edit them
directly.  I believe some of them are open source.

Here's a good place to learn about MARC: http://www.loc.gov/marc/

It is also possible to connect and transfer data around library systems via
a standard called Z39.50.  (Z39.50 client connects to a Z39.50 server and
speaks Z39.50.  Gets data, etc.)

Look into that a little more here: http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/

Heh, heh, heh.  The head of technical services (which includes cataloging)
sits right next to me.  I get to hear all about them all the time.  :)

I guarantee that my friend over here would be rolling over that one. :)
It's true.  To try to keep standardized, you have to go more or less with
LOC, or not too far from it. She's always griping about strange desisions
coming out of there.

And yes, (in response to the post over on PLUG-TALK), cataloging really is a
Black Art.  I think that's the best explaination I've seen in a long time.

It can, but they would be sharing the same session, and fighting over
control of the machine.  But even if that wasn't the case, I'm not sure how
this would work for the public, or what it would be intended to do.
Remember, it isn't incredibly simple, it will not fly. :)

Gtcam app. sees this camera and recognize it

Because the standardized diagnostics have been in-place for a while.
To run diagnostics on the drive you issue a send diagnostic command with
various options.

Because the SMART stuff in SCSI is very different.  It is built into the
log
pages.  If someone likes to dig through documents look at the SCSI Logical
Spec
for any SCSI drive.  It should be available for free, by asking.  The url
below has some info also.

If you really want to dive in, get the SCU utility and get the info
in raw mode directly from the drive.  Actually the SCU utility is nice
to have around as it has the ability to issue download command to update
drive microcode (actually it is write buffer with special options,
but it is part of the standard).
The utility has built in help.  It is not open source.

There is a different package that is derived from smart suite package,
which is smart monitor tools.  It looks like it in current development.

http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/

I had actually found this while putting together the talk but it didn't
get into the references.  That and I don't really think we got to the
references.

I don't have a G3, but I have a 10D (and before that D60, and before that
I borrowed a D30). All of them are handled by usb_storage module
and appear as regular SCSI hard disks. You can mount them and
copy all photos over to a directory, then sort it out from there.

Message-ID: <3F70E5E3.40700@botsko.net>

I am new to the group here... hello!

Anyone, I am hoping that someone here has some recommendations of a very 
odd issue.. I have been unable to find any adequate soltuions on the WWW.

I have Red Hat 9, and 7.3. RH9 Is three CDs which I know work fine, 
because I have successfully used them before. The two 7.3 CDs came from 
a textbook, so I assume they work correctly.

I have installed Linux before, and am relatively familair with the 
doings... but on my Compaq Presario 900 laptop, with an Atapi (IDE) 
cd/dvd drive, her eis what happens:

I have partitioned the HD as I have before on other systems. Windows XP 
in the first partition, another for Linux and a swap partition. I boot 
the computer
with the linux install CDs... I've tried this with 9 and 7.3.

The CD-ROM is the first boot option in my BIOS... and it boots fine. I 
get the "hit enter to install linux in graphical mode" screen, and I hit 
enter. RH then proceedes to load the initial files, I see it detects my 
cd-rom in the display text and I see no errors.

RH9: It asks my language (eng) and my keyboard config (us), then comes 
up with: "There were no RedHat Linux install CDs found in your CD drive."
RH7.3: I get a blank blue screen, that says "Welcome to Red Hat Linux" 
at the top, and key definitions at the bottom (space to select, F12 for 
next screen etc)

At this point, I am stuck. Nothing will allow me to procede.  I know the 
CD was in there, I have used the CDs before so I know they burned 
correctly, AND they booted just fine.

Any recommendations?

I jump off into the deep and a bought a new system.  I don't even remember
the model just a high end AMPTRON with a Athalon XP(?) processor.  (How's
that for non-geekishness?  :-)  Anyway it came with an IDE CD-RW which my
first fun pass at installing RHL 9 recognized and assigned to (pseudo-)
SCSI0.  I am parting out my other system and will be installing real SCSI
stuff from it including an Adaptec 29160 host card, and 18 and 36 GByte
drives.
   My question is will the IDE CD-RW drive get placed on SCSI1 and would
any USB drives get placed on SCSI1 or 2?


TIA,

I've run into similar problems with RHL 7.3.  Try creating an install 
floppy and booting from that.

Sounds like you may be having problems with the drive reading the CDs.
Try other CDs, burn a copy of the ones you have, anything to change the
media in the drive. 

May not be it, but some times that does weird things like this for me...

Subject: [PLUG] Help with log file merge script?
Message-ID: <20030924053449.34303.qmail@web14404.mail.yahoo.com>

Can someone provide me with an example on how to do this? I have two
log files that are in this format, a date stamp and a value:

log file 1		Log file 2

200309231012	50	200309231012	25
200309231013	75	200309231013	50
...

I want to create a third log file that is has the aggregate values of
the first two log files, that looks like this:

log file aggregate of 1 and 2

200309231012	75
200309231013	125
...

What's a quick way to do this?
I've got as far as sketching out creating two arrays in a bash
script, adding the 2nd value of each array into a third array and
dumping this back to a file, but there has got to be a nice simple
way to do this. It doesn't have to be all that fast, it's a cron job
that runs every 5 minutes and handles about 1000 data points max.

You'd have a VNC client on the linux box (probably iconified, with the
icon saying Expedia or whatever the Windows-only database is) and then
when you click on it and get the VNC window, you can interact with
that app, which is really running on the NT server.

You can't have multiple people logged on to the same NT box at once (you
can, via VNC, but they fight against one another for control)... without
Windows Terminal Server, which costs you per-seat.

Here's a first approximation (not tested):

  sort logfile1 logfile2 | awk '$1 != last { print last, sum ; sum = $2 } $1 == last { sum += $2 } { last = $1 } END { print last, sum }' > logfile3

This gives you an extra line at the top, but you can get rid of that
by branching around the first "print" if "last" is empty (or the lazy
way, by just stripping the first line of output with "tail -n +2").

If you are certain that the two input files are already sorted, then
you can give sort the "-m" option which will be faster.

Subject: [PLUG] Viewing messages in pine & filtering spam
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0309240629330.23493@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  This question is to help me understand what's going on, and why my blank
message postfix regex works some times but not all the time.

  In /etc/postfix/body_checks I have the regex:
                             /^ $/	reject ...

I discovered that I needed the space between the line beginning and line
ending metacharacters or it did not work at all. Now, with the above, many
of the (apparent) spam/virus messages that come in with no body content are
rejected before they get in the door. However, some do end up in my inbox.

  When viewd in pine they appear no different: nothing's in the body.
Obviously, there are differences; perhaps more than a single space or a
non-printing/displaying character. I've not yet figured out how to
generalize the above regex without rejecting messages where a line has any
characters in it (e.g., reject only if there's noting but white space and no
characters at all in the message body).

  As I wrote above, this is more to satisfy my curiosity and to further my
understanding of what's going on so it's not a critical issue.

Many thanks,

I'll try that... but I don't think it will it work. Booting works just 
fine... the cd reads, runs through all of the initial setup phases. It 
does everything up to
"loading /sbin/loader/"

I even tried typing linux hdc-cdrom at the boot: prompt... but it just 
does the same thing. (I tried hda/hdb but they gave kernel panics)

I took a picture of the error message I get, AFTER all of the items are 
loaded:

Once you get this error message hit Alt-F4. See if there are any errors regarding loading modules. Most of the time I have seen this it has been caused by something not loading correctly. We just need to figure out what it is.

Subject: [PLUG] text file for procmail lookups
Message-ID: <1064424747.1150.83.camel@rhws.theplatinumrule.com>

I'm pretty happy with my spamassassin and procmail filtering for spam,
but from time to time, I want to add addresses to my procmailrc.

They're always in the same header, so I was thinking it would be nice to
have my procmailrc look up values in a file. Is this possible? I'm not a
programmer and don't play one on TV. There's nothing that I can find in
man procmailrc. for an example. I'm sure I'd need a variable declaration
somewhere, but I have no idea how to proceed. I was thinking something
like this:

VARIABLE=/etc/BADSPAMMERS
:0H 
* ^Received:. *.<VARIABLE>
/var/spool/mail/procmailspam/

This way I can just pop the offending domain, like "picaper.com" into
the /etc/BADSPAMMERS file and they're instantly nailed the next time
mail comes from them.

I believe this would assign the literal text string "/etc/BADSPAMMERS" to 
the variable named "VARIABLE".  To assign the contents of the file, 
/etc/BADSPAMMERS you would need to dump its output something like "cat 
/etc/BADSPAMMERS".  In the bash shell I would do something like 
	
	export VARIABLE=`cat /etc/BADSPAMMERS`

Not sure how you would do it in a .procmailrc.  If you don't get any other 
help on this list, I recommend the following for more details.

man procmailex

http://www.ii.com

and 

http://MailMan.RWTH-Aachen.DE/mailman/listinfo/procmail

beware though, the procmail list is very busy (high volume).  I found that 
only the postfix users list is even more busy.

Message-ID: <20030924203042.59382.qmail@web10910.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I am using Coldfusion and Mysql for the web
application project. It worked fine before I restart
my linux server, the Coldfusion is automatically start
during the booting process. This time after I reboot
the server, the Coldfusion needs to be initialized by
the command "cfexec -install <dir> -docroot <dir>...",
I did the initialization, and then I have to start the
Coldfusion manually and it works but somehow the Mysql
database seems not to connect with Coldfusion, because
I can't get any data from the database. I wonder is
the link between Coldfusion and Mysql need to be reset
or the ownership of Coldfusion can't be accepted by 
the Mysql. 
 
I am appreciated any input or help for this.

Ming

get a mini keyboard that has function keys and the four arrow keys; similar
to a notebook computer keyboard.

  Does anyone know of a local vendor for these? I've found one that looks
like it would work, but it's relative pricey. The Happy Hacking keyboards do
not appear to have function or arrow keys and are very expensive.

TIA,

www.cyberguys.com has a variety of compact keybords for sale, but
they're not local, of course.

  Well, I solved the problem of huge file size by recreating the figure in
tgif. Took about 45 minutes and the final .eps file is 37K (rather than
25M).

  Thanks, Daniel. $30 is certainly better than $54 (the one I found on the
Web at the manufacturer's site).

  Isn't it interesting that a smaller keyboard with fewer keys and other
materials costs about three times as much as a "standard" one? Ah, well.

Heh. When I was working for Sears shipping arm many moons ago, I
noticed that nearly all inter-store transfers on the west coast went
through the Los Angeles cartage dock. If the Phoenix manager wanted to
transfer an item to the Tucson store, it went through LA. Sacramento
to Modesto? Same thing.

Booking a low-volume short haul was noticeably more expensive than
piggy-backing on an existing long-haul route -- even if it meant the
freight travelled hundreds of miles out of the way.

Either that, of the retailers of smaller keyboards are playing a
cynical game of, "OK, don't buy from us. Where else you going to
turn?"

The latest version of the Happy Hacking keyboard has arrow keys, but no
function keys.  It's possible to generate function key keycodes by 
holding down a special shift key and pressing the standard number keys
along the top row.

It wouldn't surprise me if it's because the "regular" keyboards have
dozens of manufacturers across SE Asia all trying to make them $0.01 
cheaper than the other guy.

I know I've personally not paid more than a couple bucks a keyboard in
the last 5 years by buying my keyboards at junk shops/surplus
stores/thrift shops - I buy a couple at a time just in case one of the
$0.50 keyboards doesn't work.. 

Last time I was at Wacky Willy's (the one in NW PDX) I seem to recall
seeing a ton of keyboards, a few of which weren't the "regular" sized
ones, you might check it out.

galen,

  I see that the Happy Hacking Lite 2 has arrow keys and a $70 price tag
(without the arrow keys the price is $130 -- on sale). I found a mini
keyboard for $30 with both arrow and function keys.

Many thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Beaverton Library again
Message-ID: <20030925001644.GB23369@gate.kl-ic.com>

Howdy, got to this discussion late.  About the Beaverton Library,
Welchia worms, Linux, and all.  I was also annoyed, looked into it,
and need to do more.  I think there is a project here.

Background:

First, there are three organizations involved in the Beaverton
library, and no doubt for the rest of Washington County.  (1)The
Beaverton library is owned and operated by the (2)City of Beaverton,
which does the computer maintenance on the computers, which are
city property.  Thus, anything affecting those computers requires
buyin from the city and the library bosses.  The library computers
talk to Wilinet, run by the (3) Washington County Interlibrary
Loan Service.

The public computers are mostly aging ~200MHz-ish Pentiums running
Windows NT, set up to always be in Internet Explorer.   The "card
catalog" computers have their browsers set up to always connect to
the Wilinet catalog system.  The "public internet access" computers
are set up to run through a (local) program that asks for a library
card number, then access Explorer.

There are also some computers "donated" by the Bill&Mel Gates 
Foundation.  What do you want to bet that the Beaverton Library
is contractually obligated to run Windoze on those computers?

The recent worm attack hit all those computers.  The Beaverton
maintenance types were fighting infection and re-infection.  The
machines were cleaned up, then left turned off until they had
cleaned up all the computers.  I wonder if they knew what they
were doing?  No doubt they will all go down again when the next
chinese virus hits, rumor has it in a few days.

The library card catalog system is accessed over the web.  The
central system for the entire county is Wilinet, the Washington
County Interlibrary Information Network.  It runs on Polaris 
library software, proprietary code from GIS Information Systems
of New York, http://www.gisinfosystems.com/default.asp .
This is a formidable mass of software, since it manages about
a million volumes at 18 libraries, hundreds of thousands of
subscribers with individual accounts, etc.  It serves general
users, library terminals, librarians, checkout clerks, etc.  It
has lots of extra functions such as making annoying phone calls
when books are overdue, ordering books from the cheapest vendor,
etc.   Big iron stuff.  It also runs on NT.  Can you say, virus
magnet? 

That said, Wilinet runs pretty well;  they recovered from Welchia
in hours, while it took the city a week.  There are open source
alternatives ( see www.koha.org ) but those are managing much
smaller collections right now, and probably lack the features.

A plan:

At the World Science Fiction Convention in Toronto, there was
an Internet Lounge with about 40 recycled computers similar to 
the old junk run by the Beaverton Library.  They were all 
running a homebrew version of Knoppix 3.2, assembled by Colin
McGregor.  That version did mail, web browsing, and attachment
viewing.  Everything ran off CDROM.  While we lost about four
computers that weekend from hardware failure, and had some
problems with the hotel network (too much cascaded NAT, I
wager), there was not one single user complaint (out of about
a thousand users, 24 hours, 5 days), no software crashes, and
nobody had problems adapting - not even the Mac people!

I have copies of that Knoppix disk.  May I humbly suggest that
we replace the splash screen with something Beaverton Library
oriented, tinker a bit, and make a few dozen copies for the 
local libraries to play with?  The next time a worm hits, they
can bring a few computers back up with the CDRom, certain that
these computers are virus-proof!  That will take some CDRom
drives, of course, and perhaps some mods to keep the disks
from wandering.  In the longer term, some sort of internal
USB flash reader might be better;  after all, when you strip out
everything but a web browser and a mailer, the compressed image
that results will be fairly small.  We might even be able boot
the machines from a boot server.

Again, this would be working with just the individual libraries
and municipalities to replace local software on machines effectively
operating as thin clients.  When that is done, and after Koha or
other open source solutions have had some time to grow, we can
lobby to install that, in Washington and Multnomah counties. 
That will probably be a few years out.


We might do better with Koha, in the short term, on some other
smaller library system somewhere in the state.  I am thinking
Benton County, City of Corvallis.  There are no doubt Corvallis
folks that would be glad to spearhead such a move (Dave M.?),
especially if the rest of us were around to help.

All you Washington County types that are interested, send me
some email.  We can arrange a meeting with the folks at the
Beaverton Library, or the Washington County Interlibrary
Loan Service (I have a number).  If we take this one step at 
a time - emergency disks for the librarians, then the whole
library, then things sorta gravitate towards permanence. 
Evolution takes patience, but always wins.

Another source of keyboards is the Tektronix RAMs Country Store,
open Thursdays at 2pm.  Company excess stock, retired equipment,
etc.  Also about 30 weirdos that line up during the half hour before
opening and shoot the breeze.  In the basement of building 38
(used to be electrochem, what *is* that brown stuff dripping down
the walls, anyway?) on the main Tek campus, and since all Portland
area technologists over 40 used to work at Tek at one point or
another, just find an old fart and ask where that is.

They sometimes get minature keyboards.  Heck, once they had a
stack of brand new ones in the box for $5.  I got one, real handy
for troubleshooting.  Last I looked, they had a small heap of
Sun Sparcstation 5's and earlier, plenty of big keyboards, a few
300MHz Pentium towers, some old test equipment, and plenty of oddball
electronic components.  A week ago, they had a huge server rack
full of 4GB SCSI hotswap hard drives, $100 for 160GB the hard way.
So odds are low that you will find a mini keyboard, but not zero.
Fairly high that you will find something or someone interesting.

File -> Open should import just about anything into openoffice, if it's
a non-native file format it'll ask you to set the import parsing rules.

Is that not working for you?  Or are you not importing tabular data?

Well, I can't complain about their choice of CPU. :-)

Of course, one question which they might ask is why they would want to
change (other than better virus immunity).  Unless they're under some
annual licensing scheme (like MS was trying to threaten everyone into
getting), they wouldn't save any money by moving to Linux, since they
BOUGHT the HW and they BOUGHT the SW.  Do they have any plans to buy
new equipment?  Are the users complaining about the machines being too
slow?  (Opportunity to make the "Linux is more efficient than Windows on
older hardware" argument.)

Those could be the servers for the legacy apps.

How can "big iron" run NT?  Are you talking about something like a big
Unisys SMP server?

Count me in.

How does this compare to the article that was posted on Slashdot a few
weeks ago, arguing that a radical switch to Linux may be cheaper than
a gradual change?  (I think their main argument seems to be that
admins who are used to the MS way of doing things will try to do
everything the same way on the Linux boxes, which is sub-optimal.)

(Personally, I think the gradual way, especially the clients-first

My son is turning nine next month and wants me to teach him how to
program.  This is something I used to do (Perl mostly) but have lost my
way.  Nonetheless, he has an interest and I would love to show him
without turning him off.

Does anyone know of a book that might guide us through this?  I should
also stress that right now his machine is Windoze machine because it is
the family computer.  Eventually if he gets decent at it, I will get him
a linux box, but right now I want him to start slow.

ahh, first open up a new spreadsheet (File-> New-> Spreadsheet) then
from the spreadsheet window try opening your file.

nevermind that - I had expected OpenOffice to do the right thing and not
pay attention to file extensions, but I was wrong, not the first time.

I guess the only reason to use OO is that it's free, as it seems to suck
as much as MS Office.

Rename your file to some "spreadsheet-like" extention - .csv or
something and then try opening it..

ActiveState Python and either a book on the subject or the Python
Tutorial.

Python is syntactically simpler than Perl, or in fact, any major
language, which makes it a great learning language. It's also very
powerful, which keeps them interesting, especially when you show them
the two lines of code required to open up the system's default web
browser and view a page[1]. I helped teach it to about 120 college
students who were only in the course to fulfil a science/math
requirement last year, and even the most braindead of sociology majors
managed just fine. Although the football players did resort to
cheating...

The real benefit of it is that ActiveState Python comes with a fabulous,
simple IDE for Python which gives immediate feedback so that it's easier
to program in it. Write a line or two of code, hit run, see if it works.
Get errors. The tutorial and documentation is in the help menu.

I just opened a MS Word document, used OO writer. I selected the text in
a table, copied and pasted it into calc. Worked like a charm.

How does that do for you?

  That's because the developers insist on making it as much like MS-O as
possible. I had this discussion with them a year ago and I walked away from
it when they just did not get it.

  My point: why would _anyone_ switch to OO.o when it's no better than MS-O,
and the user didn't pay (separately) for the latter in any case? If somone
offered to replace your computer with one exactly like it, would you
instantly jump on the opportunity? Of course not! So, OO.o sucks by design.

It depends.

Maxtor, and Seagate have gone the low price road. Their drives are 
their better consumer grade drives (7200RPM 8MB Cache) repackaged to 
use SATA. Internally, many of their drives are really, old parallel IDE 
electronics, that have a SATA to PATA (Parallel ATA, or old IDE) 
converter added. Drives that use the SATA to PATA route will not be 
able to take advantage of the full 150MBps data rate that SATA allows, 
but the drives were typically, Ultra ATA 133, so they do get close.

Future iterations of drives from Seagate and Maxtor will eventually 
take better advantage of SATA and should get to where they can send the 
full 150MBps. The current price premium on SATA versus PATA is ~$30.

So for Seagate and Maxtor, SATA will filter from the top of the 
consumer market to down like all Ultra ATA 133, and Ultra ATA 100 
before it.

Western Digital is different. Initially, Western Digital decided to use 
SATA as an enterprise type of drive. The first Western Digital SATA 
drive was a 10K RPM ~36GB drive that costs almost as much as similar 
SCSI drives. I've recently seen advertisements for Western Digital 80GB 
drives with 8MB cache, for about $30 more than the PATA version of a 
similar drive. Which looks like more of a simple repackaging of current 
IDE offerings. So who knows.

It seems that SATA is going to be for both high and low end drives.

What I think will be the biggest pain for dealing with SATA is that 
there is only one drive per IDE channel. While this does mean no more 
dealing with master/slave/cable select, it also means motherboard 
manufacturers will need to put more channels on. The standard two 
channels just isn't going to cut it. Until that happens PCI SATA card 
makers will be happy.

All this to get rid of those short fat IDE ribbon cables....sigh...

  Cheers,
Brad

Didn't pay separately? Is Microsoft Office now included in the
price of Windows or the price of computers?

I want something small and inexpensive.  I print colorful things

Computers.  And, FWIW, I bought a Toshiba about two years ago that
didn't have MS Office on it, and my current Dell, which didn't have MS
Office on it about a year ago.

When I sell a computer to somebody, unless they specifically say they
want MS Office on there, or are in an environment where OO wouldn't
quite do the trick, I just put OO on there.

  It's not uncommon, or is a small incremental cost at time of purchase
- I just bought a laptop for somebody and to get MS Office it was only
an additional $55 I believe.

  It wouldn't surprise me if in large -IT organizations even *thinking*
about it costs more than buying it on a per-computer basis (making sure
your licenses are valid costs much much more of course)

Not a universal opinion, by the way, on any of those counts.

(For example, Perl v Python is merely a matter of exposure and
familiarity.)

But you knew that.

No, I'm not arguing for Perl. :-)

But Smalltalk is probably about the syntactically simplest language
(other than Lisp :), and is a much better learning language,
especially for OO concepts.

See www.squeak.org, and look for "Squeak: Object-Oriented Design with
Multimedia Applications" by Mark Guzdial (copies sitting on the
Powell's shelf right now), for a good cross-platform *real* IDE and
great learning environment.  Also check out www.squeakland.org for how
Squeak is being used in training environments.

Why not JavaScript? Okay, sure, it's a buggy, ridiculous language, but 
there are some nice features - write a script to change the browsers 
color, things like that. Since it works within a web browser, there's an 
immediate sort of buy-in for beginners - it's not like you have to go 
through the process of explaining the command line. Plus, syntactically, 
it will provide somewhat of a bridge to Perl, Java, and C.

Message-ID: <37568.68.107.223.201.1064509471.squirrel@webmail.pdxlug.org>

I have a webpage where a user selects a variety of parameters, including a
directory containing images, and these parameters are saved as cookies.  I
haven't found a way for the user to select a directory instead of a
specific file.  It looks like HTML only allows the selection of a specific
file and not an entire directory.  If anyone knows of a solution of how to
have the user browse their filesystem and choose only a directory, I'd
love to hear it, maybe using some other non-HTML method?  Currently the
user has to go into the directory and choose a specific image.  Then in my
Perl script I strip off the image name, leaving me with just the
directory, which works, but it's confusing to the user to select a
specific image.

In another unrelated field I have the user choose a specific file and I
save the path to that file in a cookie.  When the user returns to the
config form, I want the field to be automatically filled in with the
previous file name which would be retrieved from the cookie.  Using
onload="document.blahblahblah=cookievalue" in the body tag works for other
input types, such as text fields or pull-down menus, but it's not working
for input type="file".
Any suggestions, oh wise and knowledgable web developers?
Thanks,

No doubt.

I disagree.  The more Perl I do, the more I like Python.  I've had
adequate exposure to both, I think.  Sure, there are a handful of Perl
gurus like you who can keep the myriad of dark corners in your mind
(how's that for mixed-metaphor?), but I feel lost the more I know about
Perl.

I also seem to recall you saying once that the only parser that can
fully parse Perl is the Perl interpreter itself and that any other
parsers, like syntax high-lighters, were doomed either to failure or to
being as complex as the interpreter itself.  I seem to recall you were
bragging about it at the time and I was impressed at the time, but the
more I think about it, the less I think it's something to be proud of.  

I recall it having something to do with 'eval', so maybe Python is in
the same boat, since it has a similar mechanism.  I do note, however,
that there are at least three different implementations of the Python
interpreter: CPython (the one everyone uses), Jython (in Java), and
Stackless Python (which, uh, is stackless).  I cannot say whether this
means a Python interpreter is easier to implement or Python people just
love to implement interpreters; I'll leave that for the reader to
decide.

SmallTalk is a cool language, from what I've read.  I learned enough of
it at one point to understand the handful of examples in "Design
Patterns" that were in SmallTalk.  But I think it has a few drawbacks,
particularly for a teaching language:

  o I don't think it's easy to learn mere procedural programming; OO
might be a little difficult for a 9-year-old to start with.  Maybe not.

  o The syntax is completely different from most of the other languages
one deals with, like C, Perl, Python, shell, etc.

I will also note that one of the Randal Schwartzes of the SmallTalk
world, Adele Goldberg, co-author of "SmallTalk-80", considered by many
to be bible of SmallTalk, gave a presentation this year at OSCON--on
using Python.

One of my associates used to teach SQL as a user's first
language. He claimed that users learned interesting and
useful things right from the start - unlike the less than
useful "hello world" exercises commonly done when starting
to learn other languages.

I suspect it would be easier for a kid to start out with OO rather than
procedural programming, since OO models the real world better.

Hi all,

I am using Coldfusion and Mysql for the web
application project. It worked fine before I restart
my linux server, the Coldfusion is automatically start
during the booting process. This time after I reboot
the server, the Coldfusion needs to be initialized by
the command "cfexec -install <dir> -docroot <dir>...",
I did the initialization, and then I have to start the Coldfusion manually
and it works but somehow the Mysql database seems not to connect with
Coldfusion, because I can't get any data from the database. I wonder is the
link between Coldfusion and Mysql need to be reset or the ownership of
Coldfusion can't be accepted by 
the Mysql. 
 
I am appreciated any input or help for this.

Anyone know of a simple program to resize an entire directory of
images? My digital camera creates images that are 1280x1024, but for
web publishing I like to shrink them to 800x600, and make thumbnails
160x120. Using TheGIMP takes a lot of clicks to do a bunch of images.

I think Smalltalk is a great language to learn for a very important reason:

It was designed for children initially.

- OO is in the core.  This leads to an extremely simple syntax and ease of 
understanding.    Everything is an object.  Even the virtual machine is 
exposed as is GC, the memory subsystem etc.  

- Children were regularly exposed to it and taught to use it to see how well 
and how fast they could learn it.  Various things in the language were 
changed based on these experiments.  This is not to say that Smalltalk is a 
toy language, just that it is really easy to grasp and learn and has been 
designed to be so.

- Anthropomorphic projection is one of the key aspects of the way children 
think (and most adults).  We all tend to assume that everything around us has 
desires and feelings.  "My car didn't want to start this morning."  With a 
pure OO language, this natural psychological tendancy fits the system very 
well.

Smalltalk is one of the many things that came out of the Dynabook project(s) 
that Alan Kay has been working on in various ways for decades.  Squeak is 
what Kay and some of the other Smalltalk core people have been working on for 
a while.

That said, once you've used a good Smalltalk, programming in other languages 
seems cumbersome and frustrating, at best.  Of the languages I've looked at 
so far, only Ruby comes fairly close to Smalltalk (and it may be better than 
Smalltalk for just hacking together something that works).

So teaching your child Smalltalk may result in a precocious programmer, but 
also in one who detests C/C++/Java/Perl/C#/Python... :-)  I've known long 
time Smalltalk programmers who see little difference between programming in C 
and programming in assembly.  "Why would I focus on moving bits when I can 
focus on solving the problem?"  I'd assume that long time Lisp programmers 
feel much the same way.

Scheme is also a good learning language, but it might be a bit more abstract 
to deal with.

As I said above, Ruby seems something like the slightly odd offspring of Perl 
and Smalltalk.  Everything is an object, but it has a fairly rich syntax.  It 
has objects, classes, methods, regex syntax, closures, yadda yadda yadda.  If 
anything, it's problem is that, like Perl, it is pretty rich.  It is also 
fairly young and doesn't have the cohesive and consistent libraries found in 
CPAN or Smalltalk. Personally, I like what I see a lot, but what I see is 
mostly potential at this point.

I would definitely focus on the agile languages.  I'm old enough that I first 
learned to program in C. I feel this constrained my programming thought 
process to some extent.  I believe that, like natual languages, your thought 
processes are somewhat colored by what you first learn.

Best,
Kyle

Alright, I'm probably going to catch flames from damn near everyone on the
list for this, and perhaps rightly so, but hear me out on this.
vb
/ducks
Yeah, I know it has a ton of problems _but_
It is _painfully_easy_ to "program" simple programs with it - and he can add
pictures, sounds, stuff like that, stuff like output to a text file and
connecting to a sql database is _very_ simple.
Once he has a basic understanding you can introduce stuff like OpenGL
through it, which will probably catch his eye and you can lead him into
learning another language. It will also let you know that you messed up that
variable name or ?? as you are typing it (option explicit and option strict
on). MS gives away enough vb.net trial and beta copies you can almost
replace toilet paper and the documentation isn't too bad either. Of course,
if you've never touched vb, it probably would be a bad idea to introduce it.

	My "logic" if there is any in this reccomendation is that he is 9, he might
be a really bright kid, but I'm sure he gets bored pretty easily, and fresh
stuff helps to keep him interested - which, of course, is the entire point.
If he doesn't want to do it, he will go watch whatever mindless crap they
have on tv after school finishes or go play doom or whatever.

Alternatives?
x10 programming? I'm not sure how they are still around, but I got about 20
wall plugs and the serial controller and a bunch of remotes for about $6 a
while back - turning on / off lights etc might be interesting.

Those lego thingies that hooked up to the computer - still around?

A good java IDE for a kid, if one exists /shrug.
If you can dig up an old copy of qbasic and introduce him to some of the
graphical stuff first, that might keep him interested in it long enough,
although he might get bored.

I'd say c has a pretty steep learning curve before you get to do the "cool"
(9 year old kid's POV) stuff.

Javascript is also pretty cool, others have suggested it.
someone suggested robocode, he would probably be interested in that too.

If you have a windows based pocket pc (yeah, I'm going out on a limb here,
but I've pretty much guaranteed a beatdown at the next plug meeting, so why
not) programming for that is even easier - there are a lot less things to
deal with - and the "look ma! I hit a button on this thing and it shows a
picture of my hamster" factor might be a biggie here.

You're talking about Lego Mindstorms. Still around. Still having annual
competitions based on national standards and doing quite well. 

You can find them on www.lego.com. there's a dedicated site, too. The
Portland Robotics Club has stuff to do with it. Buy them at Fry's. 

All published software is Win based. there is a Linux port of the IR
software needed to program it.

Got a set. They're fun, but my 14 Y/O has been there, done that.

Mike

Consumer Reports' current top-rated inkjet is the Canon Photo Printer
S530D.  They've rated it a "best buy," which is very unusual for them.
 They say it's $150, very good quality, 8ppm.  The next best looks to
be a Epson Stylus C62 for $70: nearly as good, but noisy.

http://www.linuxprinting.org lists drivers for the C62 but not (that I
can find) the S530D.

Matt,

I don't know of an easy solution. For a product I've done in the past I
used an ActiveX component and a Java applet. But they have to be signed
with a code signing certificate (or the user puts up with the warning
messages).

In order to give my family a means to upload a set of pictures to our
web album I gave them rsync and a Windows batch file. Here is a page
that explains the installation: http://selover.net/postpictures/.
Actually, they also get a SSH certificate and now they can upload
without login (not included in the download of above instructions). The 
pictures are put into a designated folder on the client and double click
on a shortcut uploads them without further interaction. Not pretty but
dead simple to use.

but if that's your main criteria for choosing a language (ease of

I actually think it would be easier to teach a 9-year-old OO programming 
to start since it's very natural for people to think in terms of objects.  
The reason that picking up OO was difficult for some of us was that we had 
been steeped in procedural programming first (and for several years).  
I seem to recall a study that said it was easier to teach OO to new 
programmers than it was to teach it to seasoned procedural programmers.

True.  But that's because we're more used to C-like syntaxes (I suspect).  
I believe one of the early reasons for creating Smalltalk was to teach 
non-programmers programming.  If you've never been exposed to any of those 
programming languages you mention, I suspect that Smalltalk syntax 
wouldn't seem any stranger than C|Perl|Python|Ruby etc.

Well, it would seem ththat the Randal Schwartz of Perl just recommended 
SmallTalk.

While I would tend to recommend Ruby, I also think that Squeak would be a 
good choice for teaching kids to program.

Yes, this is the risk: By teaching him SmallTalk first, he might be put 
off by any of the industrially popular languages  He encounters later.  I 
say this half in jest, but only half ;-)  On the otherhand, you may not 
want him to grow up to be a programmer anyway given the current and future 
instability of that profession.  But even if he doesn't end up being a 
programmer by profession, it's still good to know how to program.

Well, I would contend that Ruby's builtin libraries are very cohesive and 
consistent and for me that's part of the draw.  Now if you're talking 
about things like web progamming libraries, yes, there are lots of 
libraries and the community has not yet settled on which are the 'winners'
For some that might be a bit frustrating, but it also means that there is 
great opportunity to create soemthing that will become the next 
(useful|popular|elegant) web programming library.

I recall seeing a presentation at RubyConf2002 where a console app for 
making train reservations was converted to a web app by only changing two 
lines of code.  It even handled the back button correctly by making use of
continuations - very impressive.

Indeed.  Static typing only gets in the way when you're learning (and 
later on you learn that it only gets in the way period).  You're better 
off learning any of (Ruby|SmallTalk|Python) first instead of statically 
typed languages like (C|Java).

It's interesting that colleges and Univeristies have 'sold out' to 
commercial interests by teaching C,C# or Java as first languages.  Instead 
of trying to teach concepts first they're going for syntax first.  If you 
learn the concepts well, syntax is irrelevant; you can pick up any 
language

[ Snip my potential comments about well-balanced childhoods, etc,
which I know is part of your point and with which I agree. ]

Most people who play Go profesionally start learning the game when
they're 5 or 6.  It's very unusual for anyone who learns Go after the
age of 10 to make Pro.  The complexity that a young mind can deeply
aborb is stunning, and those years make a big difference.

I think it's good to expose children to as much complexity as they can
handle as early as they can handle it.  There's nothing to say that
teaching a child to program can't be concurrent with their having
friends and plenty of time to run around outside.

> He'll probably be spending enough time in front of a screen later in

I don't think that's the only issue.  Programming is creating
complex chunks of logic that can be understood by other complex
chunks of logic.  Learned early and properly it's a skill that maps
well onto many non-computer problems.

I'd say Scheme and Logo are two more candidates.  I actually have
never used Logo (or to my recollection even ever seen it running), but
it has a reputation as the canonical children's programming
environment.  Probably worth looking at.  E.g.:

  <http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/programming.html>

Scheme, being another Lispy language[1], has very simple syntax rules.
There are some simple books for learning Scheme: _The Little Lisper_;
_The Little Schemer_ that teach by example (literally).  There are
some cool Scheme environments, like the MIT Scheme I think, which have
graphing libraries.  I recall there is one associated with _Structure
and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics_ (Sussman and Wisdom, MIT
Press), freely downloadable (the book and the software).

One of the very, I think, crucial things about good learning languages
is the Read/Eval/Print loop (the system reads your command, evaluates
it, and prints something, usually your result).  It gives the user
*immediate* feedback about what they just did.  No lengthy
edit/compile/debug cycle to get frustrated over.  Save that for after
they are hooked.  The immediate gratification will draw them in and
then (Vader: "If you only knew the *Power*!) it's all over.

[1] Curiously, Common Lispers don't like to acknowledge that Scheme is
    a Lisp with some justification that makes sense to them, while
    Schemers just assume that it is a Lisp and are amazed that there
    could even be such a controversy.

Unless the various alternatives are truly opposites (e.g., life and
death) or the situation demands only one choice (soup or salad :-),
posing an either/or question is usually fallacious. Would anyone
seriously ask, "What should I do, teach my child to talk or teach her
to read?"

Obviously, the question is one of balance.

Does nobody teach logic or rhetoric these days?

Jon,

    I learned how to "program" in about 5th grade and it was in qbasic
(that's why there are quotes around program).  Then I went off into VB3, 4,
5 and then 6, and then ASP, then i found my ways into PHP/Perl and some C
and became a linux admin.

If i could offer some advise, learn something that is cross platform.  C or
C++ would have been a much better language for me to start off with because
i used to think 'what does this in basic?' and i was screwed up for a long
time because of it.  I do a lot of PHP scripting now so it's not as big of a
deal.

PHP is easy to learn but maybe not as portable as universally accepted.  My
biggest issue was qbasic was the only thing readily accesible to me growing
up.  I didn't have linux or a webserver.  I'd stay mainstream with C++ to be
honest.  And if that is too complicated for a nine year old (which it could
tend to be i would think) I would go with PHP to create dynamic web sites
and stuff.

Overall, if you're a programmer you know this, you just need a purpose for
what you want to design.  If he wants to design graphical games C++ is the
engine, if he wants to go for database/web sites PHP.  I don't know, when i
was 12 i wanted to design games.  I just didn't have a compilier nor the
internet (man to think this was just 10 years ago :) ).

My two cents.

Logo is a pretty lisp-y language (minus the syntax).  We had it
on an Atari ST, I think it was standard on the system.  I tried
to show my younger brother how to program in it, but he wasn't
really into it.  Maybe he was too young at the time.  I don't
think there's any particular advantage to Logo over any other
interactive language, its big idea was "turtle graphics", which
is simple to use, but probably looks as boring (or as exciting)
as Spirograph to kids these days.

Absolutely! And with the kids sitting many hours at school and then over
their homework, some TV and computer gaming I like seeing him outside,
for the sake of balance. 

I didn't touch a computer until in the 20s and do just fine with complex
logic (compared with people's abilities left and right). There doesn't
seem to be a necessity to hacking at age 9. Unless, of course,
professional Go is one's life's goal.

<< Many great suggestions snipped >>

If you are *really* interested in teaching your kid about programming, you
should:

1) Make three stacks of 3x5 cards.  On the first stack, write out a high
level description for a programming project.  On the second stack, name an
arbitrary software development methodology.  On the third stack, define an
arbitrary time frame.  Randomize the three stacks, and then deal your kid a
three card project.  Something like: "Card 1 - Implement a hardware device
driver, Card 2 - Using Object Fortran, Card 3 - within 30 days" would be
appropriate.  

2) Implement the most bizarre and difficult software version control system
possible.  Run a cron job to mung the database on a regular basis.  The
point is to spend more time futzing with the tools than writing code.

3) Declare that there is no time or budget for training.  Your kid will need
to learn programming on the job.  

4) Schedule daily update meetings to make sure your kid is working hard
enough.  

5) Reward yourself for doing a great job!  Buy yourself a new sports car.

6) Sell something completely different than what your kid is working on.
Don't tell your kid about the changes.  Whine that engineering doesn't
design products we can sell.  

7) Reorganize!  Put your wife in charge of programming.  Demand she cut the
schedule by 50%.  Slash your kid's allowance.  Demand he works longer hours.
Offer stock options and Pop Tarts if he sticks around until he's 18.  

8) Schedule twice daily update meetings to make sure your wife and kid are
working hard enough.  

9) End of quarter!!!!  Ship out your kid's bike, the stereo, the toaster,
and the microwave oven as product.  Apply the value to Accounts Receivable.
Report your profitable quarter with the SEC.  Send out a rosy press release
that the family is shipping product and "operating in the black".  Sell your
stock when the price spikes.  

10) Lay off the cat and dog.  Sell the family to the next-door neighbor.
Get yourself appointed to the Board of Directors of the new company.  

11) Outsource your family to India.  

12) Travel extensively throughout Asia and Europe while staying in 5 Star
resort hotels.  Claim you're "opening new markets".

13) Start a new family.  

With apologies,

Steve D...   ;-)

I agree. I've often wondered where I'd be had my parents bought that TRS-80 for me in Junior High. Too bad they considered it a $300 toy, and so, wouldn't spend that kind of money on a toy.

Fry's has one, $14.99 pretty good feel, they also have one with a crappy
feel.  The good one is a BTC-9118.  I think the Fry's SKU is 3574394

Of course not, you have to be some kind of commie hippie subversive to even

Thanks for all the response.  I will look into SmallTalk.  I know a
little bit about it, but don't know if I have even seen it.  Might be
fun to learn it together.

As as outside time...... been to Oregon much?  Winter is coming on and
its being hounded for TV, computer games, or learning something new.

Also, I am glad that I could touch off the ever predictable debate:
Perl, Python, Lisp, or whatever.  Personally, I think they all taste
great and are less filling :)

Well you are not alone, I understand why some people don't like them.

One thing to watch out is there one that looks just like it that is USB.

My eldest 2 sons ( ages 10 & 11 ) are both starting with Python and Pygame.
All they want to do is learn how to write games.  So I set them up with these,
it also helps that they can use these these two can work on either the Linux 
systems or windoze in our house.  Currently they only have Python docs and some online tutorials.

Finn,

  Charles River Media publishes a book on using AI for game development. It
apparently gives characters more human features. Alternatively, it can give
humans more character.

I think VB would be a good starter language. Many a years ago I decided I
wanted to learn to program. I looked at what the popular languages were
and decided to learn C. I bought one of those tech yourself C in 21 days
books. I did a few of the days and lost interest. I didn't want ot program
some lame dos looking things, I wanted stuff that looked like it belonged
in Windows.

I kind of lost interest in programming. VB was my first "real" language I
learned. I don't consider Logo to be much of a language. In high school
the stupid computer teacher had us learn Logo on some super old Macs. Then
I took a specialed program at another school all about computers and
learned VB 5. I liked it a lot, programmed "real" apps that looked cool.
VB might not be the greatest of all languages but I thought it was fairly
simple to learn and you got impressive results in a short amount of time.

When I got to college it was all C/C++ and I came to appreciate C/C++,
also everything we did was on *NIX machines and I came to appreciate
and run *NIX.

Basically I'm trying to say is don't turn the kid off with some language
that's textual unless thats what he wants. I think most kids would be more
interested in creating something with a GUI.

But then again, do we really want to help Beaverton?  The city itself
is a blight on the Tualatin Valley to be eliminated.

Despite public dissent against it, they moved to Windows NT in the
late 1990s.  I stopped using Washington County Libraries and destroyed
my card at Hillsboro Central Library, telling them I'm not using their
libraries anymore because the new system is slow, frequently down, and
frequently wrong.

Just use Multnomah County Library.  They'll ship to you if you don't
want to go downtown.

I thought postfix body_checks regular expressions were applied to every 
line in the body.  Not the whole body at once.  Your regex would reject 
any message that has a line with a single space in it.  I think postfix 
can use PCRE regular expressions.  Since those are like Perl, they can 
be put in multiline mode and match against the whole string.  This regex 
should put match any body that only contains whitespace

/(?m)^\s*$/

Subject: [PLUG] firewire external enclosure
Message-ID: <86smmk59v7.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

Last night I put together an external firewire/USB2 enclosure and
installed a firewire/USB2 card (Adaptec DuoConnect).  I recompiled a
2.4.22 kernel with the appropriate support.  USB2 is working fine and
satisfactorily, but for some reason the Firewire isn't.  When I plug
in, /var/log/messages gives me:

  Sep 25 23:17:02 celilo kernel: scsi3 : SCSI emulation for IEEE-1394 SBP-2 Devices
  Sep 25 23:17:02 celilo kernel: blk: queue dbb84818, I/O limit 4095Mb (mask 0xffffffff)
  Sep 25 23:17:02 celilo kernel: ieee1394: sbp2: Logged into SBP-2 device
  Sep 25 23:17:02 celilo kernel: ieee1394: sbp2: Reconnected to SBP-2 device

Then I try to mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt, and I get:

  # mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt
  /dev/sdc1: Input/output error
  mount: you must specify the filesystem type

When I try specifying the filesystem type:

  # mount -t ext3 /dev/sdc1 /mnt
  mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdc1,
         or too many mounted file systems

When I disconnect firewire and plug in USB2:

  Sep 25 23:31:41 celilo kernel: ieee1394: sbp2: Logged out of SBP-2 device
  Sep 25 23:31:51 celilo kernel: hub.c: new USB device 02:08.2-4, assigned address 3

And then when I mount with "mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt":

  Sep 25 23:32:20 celilo kernel: kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds
  Sep 25 23:32:20 celilo kernel: EXT3 FS 2.4-0.9.19, 19 August 2002 on sd(8,33), internal journal
  Sep 25 23:32:20 celilo kernel: EXT3-fs: mounted filesystem with ordered data mode.

Any clues why the firewire isn't working?

As much as I enjoy watching Beaverton twist in the wind and
(hopefully) approach bankruptcy, it would save them money to move away
from Windows.  IT guys having to do weekly diaper changes on all the
Wintendos gets costly quick.  Plus, if you want to upgrade to a newer
Windows OS, guess what?  You get to replace the hardware as well.  And
you can bet they're going to need to reinstall those machines more
times than WinXP allows per license.

They ditched the perfectly good Dynix system they had and all the
terminals for a slew of i386 machines.

Get a cheap laser printer - you can find cheap ones for ~$120 if you watch
the deal sites for a week or two and get a seperate color for the color
print outs, I think albertsons has a cheapo inkjet for $40 or something, if
you really don't care about print quality that much . . .

Now, my laser printer info / advice
If it is an newer lower end HP (like 1?00 series), call up their support and
get the 3 year extended warranty - it is around $40 and they send a unit out
to you next day air when and no matter how many times it breaks (and don't
be cheap on this, because it WILL break at least once in 3 years, and
shipping printers is expensive), I'm guessing the same thing for the other
brand's lower end lasers - generally the fusers aren't made to last 3 years,
most are designed to work for a year.

 Of course, check compatibility before you buy - I believe the laserjet 1200
had some issues with macs under X a while back, but I think it has been
rectified - just don't expect much support from any printer company (short
of processing rmas). And here's an hint for calling support about printers,
always try and get the mac folks - hold times are usually a lot shorter, and
if the printer is smoking, they won't ask you to do much software
troubleshooting ;)

You will save so much $ in ink that you will be very happy and you will
virtually never have to change the toner. Print quality for letters, etc is
much better too and no more smearing printouts in our great portland
climate. I've recently printed the better part of a _box_ of paper on 1
toner cartridge on my laserjet 3p that was made in '92.

If you want to do some fixup work (and probably changing the pickup rollers
is all you need to do), there are quite literally tens of thousands of
pre-carly (key word PRE) HP laserjets out there. Sure they are big, but they
will last (laserjet 3's, 4's, you probably want to avoid the 5's though, the
laserjet 4000 and 4050 are kind of big but I've seen several with a page
count of over a million pages - basically 3 or so years of printing 24-7,
work it out if you're bored.) virtually all are available for dirt cheap -
around / under $50 or so. You can always remove extra paper trays to save on
room and used wired print servers (like a 170x or 300x) go for cheap
nowadays so you can leave that printer into a different room.

Good luck. . .

Oh and on most hp laser printer's with a display, you can change the ready
message by sending the following code ;)

Hey Jon...

Why don't you get your son and some of his friends and participate in the
ORTOP competitions. www.ortop.org or www.firstlegoleague.org 

It's a really cool way for the kids to learn to program a robot and compete
with it. The total cost is a little pricey... but if you get 5+ kids
involved you can split the cost. :)

I'm currently coaching a team of girls, and they're having a blast. It's a
great way for the kids to play with legos, learn to program a robot (a

there is a local team in the area that your son can participate with. I know
that several schools are sponsoring teams... with your son being 9 he's
right at the beginning age for the competitions (9-14 year olds).

Subject: [PLUG] Teaching My Son To Program

My son is turning nine next month and wants me to teach him how to
program.  This is something I used to do (Perl mostly) but have lost my
way.  Nonetheless, he has an interest and I would love to show him
without turning him off.

Does anyone know of a book that might guide us through this?  I should
also stress that right now his machine is Windoze machine because it is
the family computer.  Eventually if he gets decent at it, I will get him
a linux box, but right now I want him to start slow.

It sort of depends on what sort of learner your son is: visual,
verbal, ...?

If he's a typical boy, he's probably a visual learner, in which case
most of the GUI clients (incl. Mozilla) will probably do fine.

If he's more verbal, PC Pine isn't such a bad choice -- plus it'll
shield him from viruses and obnoxious HTML mail messages. :-)

Hey, now.  We have an opportunity for a child to experience Not Crap
at an early age.  Why not a quality client instead of Mozilla?

Mozilla is a competent MUA on the Windoze platform, and it keeps its
mail boxes in a standard format so they can easily be migrated when he
learns Linux. It's also a nice web browser.

Ahh, the cure for the "winter blues" is to take up winter sports.

Once I started skiing (and later snowboarding), I found myself every
fall just gleeming with anticipation for that first big cold storm.
And every formerly "yucky" day turned into "hooray - more powder!".
The first spring days brought me down a bit, and by the time the sun
was out for more than a week, I'd go into some serious depression.

It really changes your outlook about the weather.  Winter!  Love it!

So is OE, since kmail and knode exist.  Think of those two as OE if OE
didn't suck raw eggs through a coffee straw.

Sure, Adele is using Python (I'd call her the Tom Christiansen of the
Smalltalk world :).

But Alan Kay and Dan Ingalls (The Larry Wall and Randal Schwartz of
the Smalltalk world) are still actively developing Smalltalk as
Squeak, which is a direct descendent of the original Smalltalk-80
image that I used at Tektronix in 1981.  It's interesting to ask a
question on the squeak mailing list, and get an answer back from Dan
that starts with "Well, for Smalltalk-72, we considered that, but by
the time we got to Smalltalk-76, that feature had been dropped...".

Yes, Smalltalk first, Ruby next, then Perl to get the real world stuff
done.  Python if you're in to bondage and indenting the One True Way.

It would seem nice to have the Linux Clinic in Troutdale. Last July the the

 From a library user's perspective Dynix was merely "serviceable", and a 
far cry from "perfectly good", most of the web-based replacements I've 
seen are much nicer to use.

  I'm still trying to use my Kyocera QCP-6035 smart phone (with Verizon) as
a celluar modem with my Toshiba Portege 3025CT running Slackware-9.0. From
what I was told, the secret to staying connected is in the AT command
strings. But, I cannot find anything on the Web about the command set used
by Kyocera.

  Can someone here suggest a mail list, news group or other resource where I
might find help? I wonder if any local telephone/computer experts hanging
around here might be able to help me.

Eudora is available for Windows.  If that is too complex, I would set up
Squirelmail or some other web mail client.

Are you sure it is attaching the device as sdc?  Nothing from those
messages would indicate that.  Looks like it is not the right device
being used.

Try sda instead.  (Or is something else using that one?)

Also make sure all the firewire modules are loading.  My Canopus card
sometimes has problems due to only half the drivers getting loaded.

Children should be taught assembly first, then APL, then Fortran, and

If they can't write working sendmail configs by age five, swap them out
for a less defective child.

You forgot about Ada. Where would that fit in? I'm thinking just after

Not going to help, since it is mostly compiled in, not modular.  Hmm.
I wonder if there are firewire parts that _are_ modular.  I'll go
look at my .config:

  #
  # IEEE 1394 (FireWire) support (EXPERIMENTAL)
  #
  CONFIG_IEEE1394=y
  CONFIG_IEEE1394_PCILYNX=m

  CONFIG_IEEE1394_CMP=y
  CONFIG_IEEE1394_AMDTP=y
  # CONFIG_IEEE1394_VERBOSEDEBUG is not set
  CONFIG_IEEE1394_OUI_DB=y

I think the SCSI stuff should be all right, since it works with USB2.

Quite possibly, but I tried the obvious ones (/dev/sd[a-d]1)

Did.  There is something else using that, another USB device
(SmartMedia Reader), though there wasn't any media jacked in at the
time.  I think the media reader uses two SCSI devices

When I googled on this, I did see an example where a special
incantation was needed for some devices at load.  Maybe I should
recompile modular and experiment with that.

The de-motivating factor is USB2 works and seems fast.  However, I got
the dual media (firewire/usb2) card and enclosure in order to
experiment with the two and compare.  If I don't get firewire working,
then I can't do that.

Why not ask the source who told you that was the secret?  If they

Russell,

It may be a long shot, since it seems system sees the scsi device, but
try the rescan-scsi-bus.sh script at http://linux1394.org/sbp2.html.
That's an  oft-suggested remedy on the linux1394-user mailing list.

Russell,

  Because he uses a different phone and a different cellular provider.
Apparently the AT command sets are modified/extended by each manufactuer and
what Nokkia did will not apply to Kyocera. And, what the other provider
accepts as commands may not be what Verizon wants.

Ah!  Well something worked!

I can mount /dev/sdd1 now on the firewire interface.  It is possible
that I only tried /dev/sdd before, or it might have been the
rescan-scsi-bus.sh script that did it.  Anyway, it is working now.

Thanks all!

I've never tried to compile it in, but I had situations where something
gets hosed and the only way to fix it is to reload sbp2 module. I'd never
compile any of the hotplug stuff into the kernel.

Are you looking for safety / parental controls, client functionality, or both? 

ComputerBits used to have a series of articles devoted to Internet use by
children. They may still have the series going, I haven't been looking for new
hardware, so haven't been reading it lately.  There seem to be some resources
on a google of "email for kids". The k12linux list might be a better place to
ask. as I assume they have covered client, as will as safety, issues in their
project. 

I personally prefer to keep in touch with my family, mother and sisters, via
IM. We pass the occasional email, but mostly we chat. If you think this is an
option, then Trillian is my favorite client for windows. I would think that it
is easier to control unwanted contacts via IM, than via email. My experience
with this is limited, however. I usually sent up the accounts for my family so
that only people in their buddy list can contact them. I don't keep tabs on
what they do with it after I set it up as they are adults, so can't speak to
how safe this is. I have no experience in locking down a internet connected
computer so that it remains a safe envirnoment for children. 

Thank you
Russell

I've recently started to wonder when my 9yo will be wanting email, but
fear the inevitable question: "Dad, what is viagra for? "  or "What is
the email about penis enlargers?"

Spam filters and such have been known to work well, but eventually one
slips through and I am left answering endless questions that I would
rather not answer.

Funny what people worries. I have no problem at all telling them about
these silly things but I do cringe seeing them kill and destroy in a
computer game. I wish they could grow up without this.

This is from the "How do they do _that_?" department...

I use pine to read email.  I just got an email a few minutes ago which was 
from someone I didn't recognize, but the subject was a subject of an 
earlier email in my inbox.  So out of curiosity I opened it up and found 
out it was just a spam for 'herbal viagra'.  I closed it and then noticed 
that no subject was now shown in my inbox for this message (it was just 
blank).

So, how does that work?

How do you tell what server a particular Web page is from? Let's say the 
identical page is on two different servers, on two different networks- how do 
you know which one? (No, you cannot change one, it is not under your control)

Tell her not to publish her e-mail address, make it something unlikely 
to be hit by an automated bot, and put it on your own domain, on your 
own server, with a spam filter.

That will probably mitigate the risk to a reasonable point.

Sounds to me like a bug in pine - the subject was probably blank, but
when it was drawing itself, it didn't refresh the line the subject was
on until you left the message.

Also, would you mind composing a new mail to plug at lists.pdxlinux.org
instead of just hitting reply on any old message?  See, a great many of
us (the majority, I would guess) use threaded views for mailing lists
like this, so replies to earlier posts get threaded into a tree-like
view, similar to what you see with news readers.

If you just reply to a post like this, you're replying to 'email for
kids' rather than starting your own thread.

There's no easy way to know unless your Web browser stores
that information with the page when the page is loaded. I've
never seen one expose that information to you via the user
interface and I've never seen IP addresses in browser caches
but it could be there in binary and I would not have noticed.
It's possible that the IP address is in a cookie sent by the
site but you couldn't rely on this.

Web browsers don't generally keep log files so you're
out of luck there.  

I maintain mirrored servers and I try to put the server
identity as meta information in the <head> section of pages.

When I replied to Carla, I assumed that the Web servers would have
different IP addresses - that we weren't talking about a cluster
of servers all with the same IP apparent address. If my assumption
is correct, asking DNS for the address would yield two or more
answers and she wouldn't know which one.

Right. Doing any of the usual lookups- dig, host, nslookup- do not trace the 
origin of a specific page. I was futzing around with some domains hosted at 
different providers, and got sidetracked because each one uses the identical 
Apache Test page:

69.57.134.33  <-- new web host, citadelhost
207.218.248.34  <-- old web host, Page-zone

The Apache Test page displays when you enter the URL of a domain hosted on 
their server, but DNS is not caught up yet, for whatever reason. What would 
be lovely is each site putting some kind of identification on their default 
Apache pages. (I asked already)

For those who like to fool around with this kind of thing, try 
www.mtgadvocates.com and mtgadvocates.com. You'll either get the site, or an 
Apache Test page. There are a lot of chefs in this DNS kitchen: 
Easystreet.com manages their DNS. The site is hosted at Citadelhost.com. 
Easystreet configured them so:

;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.mtgadvocates.com.   77810   IN      CNAME   mtgadvocates.com.
mtgadvocates.com.       77813   IN      A       69.57.134.33
mtgadvocates.com.       77813   IN      A       69.57.134.153
;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
mtgadvocates.com.       77813   IN      NS      dns3.easystreet.com.
mtgadvocates.com.       77813   IN      NS      dns1.easystreet.com.
mtgadvocates.com.       77813   IN      NS      dns2.easystreet.com.


Querying both the Citadelhost nameservers looks like this:

69.57.134.33 
;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.mtgadvocates.com.   14400   IN      CNAME   mtgadvocates.com.
mtgadvocates.com.       14400   IN      A       69.57.134.33

;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
mtgadvocates.com.       14400   IN      NS      ns5.xfwm.com.
mtgadvocates.com.       14400   IN      NS      ns6.xfwm.com.

69.57.134.153
;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.mtgadvocates.com.   14400   IN      CNAME   mtgadvocates.com.
mtgadvocates.com.       14400   IN      A       69.57.134.33

;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
mtgadvocates.com.       14400   IN      NS      ns6.xfwm.com.
mtgadvocates.com.       14400   IN      NS      ns5.xfwm.com.

It wouldn't even be all that interesting, except the old host I moved 
mtgadvocates.com away from uses the exact same Apache Test page. So I got to 
wondering about how in the heck to know which one I was hitting? (I assume 
that once DNS propagation takes place (the DNS was changed yesterday) that 
ole test page won't come back. )

So that is how I waste^H^H^H^H gainfully spent my Saturday.

Even though I changed the subject line?  How does the threading get messed

If you look at your message headers, you'll see this right under the
Subject line:

In-Reply-To:  <1064706556.4188.12.camel at localhost>

...and that's what it threads based on.  :-)

Your mua automagically inserts that when you decide to reply to an email

Hmm, force your client to go through a cache like Squid and see what shows up 
in the cache logs?  I think you'll have enough info there...  need to have it 
save IPs, not host names though.

Would that do it?

I am wondering how to create a list of allowed smtp senders under
postfix and I'm also wonder how the deny unknown clients in the from
line for smtpd restrictions works since that option seems to block
the plug list.  I want to implement this so I don't have to deal
with people who forge the from, reply-to, etc.

Unfortunately, seems like a lot of people's email is broken somehow
and the lookups are failing even though they exist and are valid.

Subject: [PLUG] OO.o page style creation
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0309280801500.30091@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I posted this question to the OO.o users mail list several days ago but
there have been no replies. How do I create a page style?

  Looks like a simple question, but the answer eludes me because there is no
"create", "creation" or equivalent entry under "styles" in the on-line help.
Worse yet, my trial-and-error fumblings have not produced results either.
Here's the context:

  Many letters I write are longer than a single page. The fist page is done
on a template that has the letterhead in the header, the current date and
the signature block. For subsequent pages, I want a page style that has a
header with the recipient's name, the letter creation date and the page
number. It's turning into a major project. I can create this second_sheet
(as I call it) as a template, but I need it as a style to be called by the
letter template for subsequent pages.

  I've tried using the stylist and Format > Styles > Catalog > New, but the
attempts don't stick and become visible in the page format dialog box for
the letter template.

  Has anyone nailed down this process of style creation? I'd really like to
know what I've missed here so I can get past this distraction and work on
the next one.

TIA,

Rich

So... you've been following this list for awhile, haven't you. :)
The bottom line is many admins don't bother with PTRs, so I'm not sure I'd 
consider it reliable for any kind of filtering or blocking.

Just for fun, do traceroutes on samspade.org, it flags DNS errors. Almost all 
the time it's "xxx has no reverse DNS configured."

In the interest of spam control, one doesn't want 
to accept incoming smtp connections from people 
who won't identify themselves properly making it 
difficult to deal with them in an affective manner.  

Black hole is an option, but noone wants to receive 
stuff they don't want anyways just to throw it
away.
  
You need to know you don't want the email before you
grant the connection to download it, what are your
options here?

There are legal concerns with allowing connections 
for spammers of any sort unchecked, liability 
concerns.  For example, imagine someone decides
to figure out you have an email address and
then sends illegal material to it.  If law 
enforcement finds out about this material say 
you go to prison for it.  I think it's clear 
that you can be held responsible for anything 
on your computer no matter how it got there, 
even if only a ghost of it is left.

Why is anyone against requiring Internet sites 
to maintain proper PTR records for all mail service?  
Is a special dns record needed for each mail address 
at a site or is just a reverse record for the mail 
server's ip address needed?  Anyone have a better 
idea to address the problems of fake from, no abuse
address that works, fake reply, etc?

Yes this involves looking someone up before accepting 
them in, however, forcing spammers to use addresses 
that are registered is more likely to push them out 
into the open where it's possible to get them or 
someone relaying them to stop sending the messages
to your server.  The latter is usually the best 
solution.

The only alternative I can think of is to use Postfix's
pattern matching and limit acceptable addresses to the
one's I know I need to work with, for obvious
reasons this is a dubious approach as it doesn't 
allow for growth very easily where I don't know how
to do this either.

More on the legal end, how can you best protect yourself 
from what may come to you or go out from you via email?

You've brought up an interesting forensics problem that
I've been concerned about for many years and have written
and lectured about. If, for example, child pornography is
attached to a message in your e-mail inbox, I doubt you'd
be prosecuted (even with the present administration)
because it can be assumed that it's unsolicited. 

But delete the message and the attachment and the data is
logically deleted but still there on your hard disk with,
perhaps, no way to determine that it's origin was 
unsolicited incoming e-mail.

However, this may have little to do with the discussion of
PTR records.

Just a single record for the IP address (the in-addr.arpa
domain) normally maintained by your ISP or whoever the
ISP delegates that portion of the in-addr.arpa address
space to.

I don't know the answer to your question, but I don't
want you to feel neglected. One possible reason for a
deficiency of resources in this area is that a style
doesn't have any appearance of its own; it merely
modifies the appearance of other html documents. It's
not WYSIWYG. (The style sheet I use for my own simple
Web site, below, has two lines.)

If OO does have these capabilities, however, I hope
someone will answer your question.

Message-ID: <01C3841B.B6F0BE80.drcaldwell@cablerocket.com>

G'mornin', Folks...

I've tried, in my naive way, to install this pkg. thus:  hda1 = /boot @ 
20MB; hda5 = / @ 1.7GB; hda6 = /home @400MB; hda7 = swapspace2 @ 2x 
SDRAM; 2.1GB Unallocated.  Hdb = Win2k w/several partitions.  Hda set up 
came from "Linux for Windows Addicts" by Michael J. Miller (who no 
longer has a valid e-mail adr. as published in his book).

With this partitioning set up, I assumed the /boot would be the 
partition that all boot-related files would go into, however, when I 
bootup, I don't get any OS choice.  To switch from Win2k to Linux, or 
vise versa, I have to either edit the default hdd in my BIOS, or leave 
it set to the Win2k hdd & use a floppy to get to Linux.  What's wrong 
that I don't get the boot menu?  Is there some file that needs to be 
hand-edited, & if so what are the needed commands?

Maybe my 1st question ought to be ... am I following descent 
recommendations, or not???

Ain't it fun dealing with a neophyte????  I've forgotten all the 
commands to using vi & emacs from 20+ yrs ago, so is there a more 
word-like text editor to use in Linux?  My text editor of choice in DOS 
was QEdit... but don't know how to access it on hdb.

Thanks for any & all serious help... humor can come later, please... all 
I'd need is tongue-in-cheek being taken as sound advice...  :-)

About six sites didn't resolve.  I think part of the problem is that
you often have to ask the ISP to enter a reverse record because the
ISP controls it.  I bet 90+% of UCE comes from sites that don't have 
a PTR record.  Sites need to be required to have abuse addresses
that work.  If you don't figure out how to deny a connection for
spammers, you've lost to them.  I think a lot of people spam 
regardless of whether or not they get the reply they want based 
on perhaps as little as where you've been or even less than that.

One option is a program that tests email to see if it's spam then
email a reply back if it is deemed so indicating why.  Unfortunately,
the reply-to address can be wrong or in the case of some spammers, 
disabled because they are abusive.  I've seen cases where the abuse
address is disabled also, this is true for yahoo.com.  I block 
yahoo.com now because I get spam from it and can't complain about
it.

At ftp://ftp.robinson-west.com I have rfc2505, rfc2505.txt, which
states that we should all be running PTR records and check for
them with our mail servers as one measure to control and reduce
spam.  My ISP controls my public subnet's reverse zone where I 
contact them about what records I need for it.  For my private
dns I do forward and reverse dns for every computer on my lan.
It's not hard to do reverse zones if you can do forward zones.

Well I have some classmates in physics whose email addresses are
the following, domain only: hotmail.com, msn.com, and hotmail.com
again.  Are there reverse records for these domains or do I need
to do something special under postfix to let my classmates email
me so as not to abandon the deny unknown clients in the from
line protection?

I'm a novice C and C++ programmer so I thought I'd look at the source
code of fortune-mod to figure out how to add a feature that would make
it easy say in a gtk program to select individual fortunes for removal
and add new ones.  I can't read the code, it doesn't make sense.
Is there a way to easily a create a new fortunes database?

Anyone know of a good reference on Linux C as opposed to ansi C?
I want to know what the system libraries are being included and why
they are being included.  This Amy what's her name didn't put any
comments in the code to help me follow it where there seem to be
a lot of macros.  The makefile seems to be far more complex
than anything I've ever done.  My idea of a makefile is:

all:main.c etc.c
	gcc -o desired_name main.c etc.c
clean:
	rm -f *.o desired_name

A lot of packages require fortune-mod under Redhat, but I'm not sure
why.  I like the idea of a fortune program and wanda the fish is
cool, but I want to fix what the actual fortunes are.  There are text
files and .dat files.  Apparently the .dat files hold pointers into 
the text files.  Is there a way to update the text files, a.k.a delete
the fortunes I don't like, and then rebuild the .dat files?  There are a
lot of things I don't agree with in fortune or don't find particularly
funny.

The Holy Grail of email management is finding that magic method of identifying 
spam. Unfortunately there is no magic spam key. It's a continually escalating 
war, and the dirty bastards ruin everything they touch. They're like rats who 
piss on what they can't eat. William James said it best in "Thanks the 
Spammers", http://www.spamreaper.com/thankspammers.html

Spammers get paid to send zillions of messages. I doubt that many care how 
many are received, let alone read.

Most spam not only has forged return addresses, they're sent via open relays 
and hijacked proxies. Any kind of autoreply is as useless and annoying as 
those lame anti-virus programs that autoreply to the forged sender. Which is 
what, all of them?

No, it's not difficult at all. I don't know why so many admins don't.

Having good whitelists is crucial when using any kind of filtering or 
blocking. I think blocking mail based on PTRs is going to lose a lot of 
legitimate mail, if it were me I'd monitor the logs very closely, and make 
sure my whitelists were complete.

When you look at all the millions of winduhs boxes on cable/dsl that have been 
Trojaned and turned into happy little spam relays, and all the crap proxying 
software for winduhs that ships wide open, such as the extremely popular 
AnalogX, and all the other hijacked proxies and open relays in the world, and 
spam-friendly countries like Brazil, China, and Korea, and organized 
spam-crime gangs in Russia... well I don't what to think, except it's a 
complex problem. And it's frustrating to have a pile of perfectly good 
sticks, and no spammers at hand to beat.

  Er, "Tim", we're writing about two different things. Strange as it may
seem, styles are not used only on the Web! Really!! In LaTeX there are
styles for books, reports, articles, letters and so on. In OO.o there are
styles for paragraphs as well as for pages.

  As with the Web, styles control layout. However, I don't write in html;
particularly not in letters to clients, agencies and others.

This scheme looks okay, 20Mb used to be plenty for /boot, and will probably 
be okay as long as you don't install more than two Mandrake kernels.

Partitions are not your problem.  Looks like you don't have a boot loader 
installed or setup properly.  Mandrake is probably using 'grub' by now, the 
other option is 'lilo'.

Boot into Linux and look for the config file for your boot loader. (If using 
grub: /boot/grub/grub.conf, or if using lilo: /etc/lilo.conf)

If you don't find either of these, or do this anyway, find the X-windows gui 
app from your menu.  (I'm not familiar with Mandrake so you'll have to poke 
around.)  If you can't find anything at all in the menus, bring up a 
terminal (xterm, rxvt, gnome-terminal, whatever) and type,
	
	$ rpm -q grub
	
if it returns "package grub is not installed", then you now know you need to 
install it.  If it returns an affimative response, then post your grub.conf 
here and we'll see what we can see.

I highly recommend 'nedit' (If it's not already installed or on your cd, get

Most excellent editor, no bullshit.

I think my email address is too attractive.  Some of the stuff 
I'm getting, let's just say it's probably targeted at the name 
in my email address because it's a male name.  I want to switch 
to an alias and forward to my michael account so that michael 
is removed from my email address making it less attractive to 
dirty married women and dirty pharmaceuticals.  Only one other 
account on my mail system is getting hit, my email address 
being the clear favorite.  

So I've been thinking I can do aliasing under Postfix where I'm
wondering if I can alias a gender neutral number to michael then 
block anything addressed to michael instead of the alias from 
outside my local area network. 

It looks like a losing battle to keep the michael address reasonably
clean.

I don't think supposed gender of the username has anything to do with
targeting. I get all kinds of crap for both sexes. Changing your username
won't help unless you /never/ use it in a way that spammers can discern.

Cleaning my computer room, I found a copy of Leslie Lamport's "LaTeX: A
Document Preparation System" 2nd Edition.

See, I bought this book and immediately lost it (without even opening it,
it seems) and bought it again a few weeks later.  Last week I was cleaning
up some stuff and found the book in the bottom of a box along with a bunch
of stuff from an old job that I'd archived (and a pristine VHS casette of
The Hudsucker Proxy, which was a real boon).

Anyway, it's brand new and if anybody either has a good use for it or a
chunk of the retail price, it can find a new owner.

Oh, I also have ass-loads of cables and old hardware that needs to go.
Particularly these double-ended PS/2 cables for KVM switches and maybe
even a double PS/2 <--> SBUS cable for sun folks that want to use a KVM
with their PC.  And lots of big hefty external SCSI cables.

Um, there's a few bajillion SCSI drives, too.  All SCSI3.  Sizes vary.

Anyway, if anybody needs this junk, let me know.

I thought about hauling it to the Lab on Thursday and then leaving the
leavings in a dumpster before coming home, but that whole "out of sight,
out of mind" thing is just too much for my stomach.

Has the time come to use organizations that understand one's beliefs and
preferences for email filtering with the technical skill to deal with
the current abuses.  It wastes your time and frankly some of this stuff
arguably shouldn't be dealt with for too long because it's nasty.  In
this scenario, your mail server can only connect to the proxy and it's
current identity is given to the proxy so that all email routed to you
goes to the proxy for checking and the proxy handles abuse claims, etc. 
Internet service providers in our country can block transmission to and
from the open proxies of foreign countries if there's an easy way to
detect these.  If these countries want to reach us, they'll close those
open proxies when they're blocked or set up acceptable exchangers.  
It's hardball, but I bet it would work.

One curiosity about the junk were all getting, has anyone found an easy
way to reduce getting the same stuff twice?  A sum of the characters in
the bodies of some of these messages would be enough for a test to find
and block subsequent copies as a lot of this spam seems to be the exact
same message multiple times.

Looking on one spam list I found out some of the stuff I'm getting is
definitely spam.

How does the ipcop firewall forward outbound requests for
masquerading?  In my environment you need to have the
correct ip to go out and the administrator needs to run
a command to add a specific forwarding rule for you.
Is the ipcop box an smtp server that needs to relay
her computer as well as yours?  Are you both on the
same subnet?  Do you know if there's a heavy load
of email or other data that could explain an
outage?  Does your machine and hers compare
performance wise?  How about programs she is
running in the background?

I've got a RH 7.1 box that goes down on apparently random Sundays, some
time after 0400, after it runs it's nightly backups. By down, I mean
that it's powered up but unresponsive to the outside world in any
meaningful way. No display, no samba, no ssh, nothing I can verify from
my remote location. I have the customer power it down via big black wire
in the back (they broke the case switch, pressing too hard one Monday
morning a few months ago) 

It comes up just fine, ready to work it's heart out.

I cannot find anything in the logs that points me in a single direction
that I can tell.

Should I be keeping a new kind of log?

I'm not running any cron jobs on a weekly basis that could be jamming me
up, where do I find out when logrotate decides to do it's thing?

There is plenty of space on all partitions.

Historically, it has not failed,in any way, due to hardware.

There's this /var/log/samba/nmb.log entry this morning that makes me
curious, though:

[2003/09/27 04:02:57, 0] nmbd/nmbd.c:sig_hup(92)
  Got SIGHUP dumping debug info.

The most consistent cause of system failure is flaky power
supplies, power connections, drive performance, and in the
case of one machine I had it was shorting.  Do you have enough
electrical power, I guess I recommend 300 watt or larger power
supply.  Are the drives that are installed designed for the
distances they are set apart from each other?  Does the processor
stay cool enough or does it overheat slowly and trigger an
emergency halt?  what does pstree give you and is the server
running anything it shouldn't?  What version of samba is running?
Can you put samba on a cheap say 486 to isolate it from this system
and see if in fact that is the part that's failing?  Do you have
one and a proper wins server set up?  Does your customer have too
many cascaded hubs?  Do you have one samba domain master browser?
Is authentication information for samba on this box or another,
you'd be amazed how often I cause a problem by taking down a 
system that another one depends on for it's operation.

Take a peek at /etc/crontab. It'll look something like this:

# run-parts
01 * * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.hourly
02 4 * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.daily
22 4 * * 0 root run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
42 4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly

System-level cron jobs scheduled for daily, weekly, or monthly
execution will run between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m.

In particular, the /etc/cron.weekly/* scripts are launched at 4:22 on
Sunday mornings.

A serial console connection might be useful in that case; of course,
if /bin/login is unresponsive, you're pretty well hosed. :-)

logrotate is runs at 4:02 every morning as part of /etc/cron.daily.

  I used to have this problem with the networked host when we were running
RH 6.2. Every few days -- 3-4 usually -- it would be comatose from the
keyboard, but reachable vis nfs. Paul Nelson had a similar problem at the
school.

  When I upgraded to RH 7.3 the problem went away. As I had not installed
7.x prior to .3 I've no idea if whatever caused the problem was fixed
earlier.

Do you usb devices at all?  I've had timeout issue with usb keyboard and
mouse.  The other strange phenomenom I've run into with keyboards
is that you should be able to plug one in at any time to the
standard port and have it work, but even under 7.3 with a dumb
switch I lose the keyboard sometimes and have to unplug then replug
to reset it.  Redhat does probe I believe for a keyboard, maybe
something needs to be done to inform it that there isn't any keyboard
connected to it.  Turn off gpm, that might help. 

One thing that has been locking up on me in Redhat 7.3 is apm.
Why anything was ever implemented in bios for this I'll never know.
If manufacturers would stick to a standard or publish the apm design
they use with their products, it would help.

Subject: [PLUG] X "pauses", kernel questions
Message-ID: <3F785B37.3070002@spek.org>

Hello,
   Ever since I "upgraded" to RH9 I've been experiencing huge 
multi-second pauses whenever a process has to "get going" after a period 
of inactivity.  It's particularly bad when getting started up in the 
mornings after being idle all night, sometimes it takes 30 seconds for 
xlock to unlock and show the desktop.  I don't have a real screamer of a 
machine, but it's no slowpoke either (Athlon XP 1700, 512MB ram).

   I recall reading somewhere that this behavior may be alleviated by 
choosing a "better" kernel version.  Where can I find a listing of these 
kernel version to version differences to help me make the choice? 
Preferably something better than the changelog file, which often just 
lists the fix and not what the fix actually means to an end user.

thanks,
Brent

  Are there any LCD monitors in the 17"-19" range that do not play well with
linux? Fry's (much as I hate them) has an 18" monitor for an almost
reasonable price and it would certainly free up some desk space for me.

  For the Aracnet customers here: their upstream news feed suddenly imposed
a monthly transfer cap which was exceeded yesterday. We may not have Usenet

Message-ID: <20030929164607.GB11205@gate.kl-ic.com>

> Complaints about spam.

Michael, the spam you are getting is not because you have a male name,
it is because you use a common one.  Initial+name cuts it way down.
Why?  Because sites that respond properly to incorrectly addressed
email let the spammer's bots know that "fred at site.com" "joe at site.com"
"sam at site.com" aren't valid, while passing through "michael at site.com". 
Sadly, adhering to RFCs isn't always wise.

Registered DNS + Common name + No bounce = new victim.  While jeme
probably gets spam, I betcha he doesn't get the 200 per day that he
would get as james.  Unless, of course, we are being less than
fastidious with this mail group, and it is being mined by spammers.

I installed bogofilter.  It is nowhere near perfect (specificially,
it is not tweakable to detect certain things like random title
characters, or html attachments only, as probable spam) but it
does knock out 90% of the stuff.  Keeps me sane.

On the one hand, spammers make me livid and I fear that if I ever
encounter one I would be in deep legal doodoo afterwards.  On the 
other hand, the reason spam happens at all is because a few people
want the products, and right now there is not a better way to serve
these customers.  If those customers could learn about their viagra
someplace else, and if the fraud merchants were identified and
jailed, and countries that ignored local fraud merchants saw
their international communication links go dead,  spam would be
far less profitable.  Most of the trailer-court DSL crowd would
have to find more honorable work, like armed robbery. 

Think about it.  Why would any merchant pay to insert their ads
into my mailflow (at $900/million current pricing, 0.03% response
rate) when they could pay far less for a venue that targets their
demographic?  Spam is ludicrously cheap, but a targeted alternative
with a 0.5% response has got to be a better way to spend a K buck, and
you don't have angry victims ready to run you through a meat slicer.

Spam is the price we pay for ineffectively serving some customers,
and treating some kinds of products with scorn, and not prosecuting
crimes that are already on the books.

  All the Linux distro's I've seen use GCC (EGCS) by default.  It's ANSI C
compatible.  You should be writing to POSIX, unless you intended your code
to only run on Linux.  The GTK+ and Gnome libs runs on non-Linux platforms.
See the GNU and Gnome pages for coding guidelines.

Do: man fortune.  There are command line switches to modify fortunes

Aaron,

  Take a look at LyX (http://www.lyx.org). It's a gui front-end to LaTeX and
it makes writing, math and tables much simpler than text-mode LaTeX (never
mind TeX -- except for Dean).

Can you tell what the computer's doing during the pauses?  Is the hard
disk spinning up or is it thrashing about?

I understand that the 2.4.10+ series is more "swappy" than others, but I
thought RH hacked a bit on that for their distro kernel.

Never seen problems with LCDs and Linux.  They Just Work.  I saw that
monitor too.  Isn't its native resolution something low like 1280x1024?

  When your eyeballs are more than 40 years old 1280x1024 is _high_. I keep
my 19" CRT monitor resolution at 1024X968 so I can read most text without
reading glasses. Once upon a time I, too, could read maps and telephone
books without reading glasses. Of course, I was slimmer then, also. :-)

I don't think so, every 5 minutes or less I get mail that presumably has

To make sure it's not where can I check to see if they are set to spin down?

I can't tell, my case is too quiet when it's closed, too loud when it's 
open, and I don't have a hard drive light.

Would upgrading to the latest 2.4.22 help you think?

Does anyone know of a way to set commit control by branch? i.e., For files
in a given CVS module, commits to the head are allowed to all, but commits
to a branch tag are restricted to certain users?

That's not broken, that's just atypical.

It sounds like you're trying to reinvent the wheel there, and making the
standard mistakes.  Have you considered simply using one of the excellent
anti-spam systems already out there?  SpamAssassin and smamc/spamd both
work well using the heuristic approach you seem to be taking, though
Bogofilter works well enough for me.

Rob,

  $400 minus a $20 refund cupon for a net cost of $381.36 (adding the cost
of the stamp for the refund <g>).

Go ahead and send me personal mail with a suggested price.  I paid like

Um, that goes for everybody that wanted the thing.  Let's do a little

Dang.  Sounds like it's dying during logrotate or backup, which can be
the highest-stress time for a typical office server.  There also may be a
problem with the backup hardware.

Do an "echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq" to turn on Magic Sysrq.  After
that, you may be able to get the keyboard and display back with an
Alt-PrintScreen-R.  Does it run X?

Not even in the old messages or dmesg logs?

Unless it started immediately after you changed kernels, this is almost
certainly a hardware problem.  It sounds like the customer is very
frustrated with this problem, and I'd STRONGLY recommend you cut out
the diagnostics and fix it ASAP.

Compared to lost business, damaged reputation, ill will and legal
expenses, it's not terribly expensive or difficult to simply move the
drives and backup into another box and test the old one at your leisure.
And yes, that's even if you have to buy a ticket and fly there.

Make sure you run a full backup after the swap to make sure it's not the
backup system that's killing it.

Also, is the server on a decent UPS?  Maybe there's a regular brownout or
power spike that's doing it.

I would guess that most of my spam comes to me via an address harvested
from this list.  The few other lists on which I participate use different
mail addresses.  This is the only list public list to which I subscribe
with my standard address.

But you're right.  I don't get anything like 200 spams each day.  And my
name (as well as Michael's) is gender-ambiguous and I would still say
nearly all of my spam is for viagra and penis enlargement systems.

This is one of the many reasons that, if I were ever in the unfortunate
circumstance of having to name a human being, I would certainly choose
something unusual if not downright unique.  While it's a pain the patootie
to have to spell your name to people all the time and have each teacher
call you something different your entire school career (until you get old
enough for proper respect and then they only botch your last name in a
couple of different ways), it's well worth it to be able to do a google
search and know the results are for you and to not get random spam and the
like.

I mean, until we start referring to everyone by their Universal Security
Identification Number, our given names should be unique handles.

I use spamassassin and it works just handily-dandily.

I'm using the stuff at some fella's Debian backports archive.  I'll post
the apt.sources if anyone's interested.  It works great and I get fewer
than 1% error since I started feeding my mailboxes through as ham and the
missed spam as spam.

That reminds me, is it necessary to pass the filtered mail back through
spamassassin for extra weighting or is it just read once and counted?

I guess I'm just unsure of whether the system needs reenforcing.

Of course, that's illegal by treaty.  It's a restriction of trade and the
WTO forbids such interference.

I think it's the midwestern subdivision DSL crowd.  Those crackerjack

Woah.

Spam is the price we pay for insisting that the only way to improve the
human condition is by driving up consumption at a rate faster than our
increases in productivity.  This requires a constant increase in the type
and quantity of items we purchase.  It's not good enough to just buy food,
clothing, and shelter.  The economy can't survive unless you're also
buying a bunch of shit you don't need like viagra, life-like baby dolls
(made from a latex cast of a still-born baby), and USB thumb-drive
vibrating "love" toys.

If we just did the RIGHT thing and brought up employment by dropping
profits, increasing wages, and decreasing work hours (like we did seventy
years ago), people could be employed honorably (producing food, clothing,
and shelter) and not turn to such dubious lines of income.

It's time for the 30 hour work week and a $15 minimum hourly wage.

Place the busness end of a screwdriver (#4 phillips works well) on the
drive before unlocking xlock and put the butt of the handle firmly
against your ear, you can almost always hear the vibrations of the
other end clearly through any background noise.

This is also great for localizing problems in general.

  I'm still having problems with this triad (ghostscript-6.52 on Red Hat
7.3) and I'm not sure where to go for help.

  First, I print a pdf file to disk (*.ps) and get two different file sizes:
10M with xpdf and 25M with acroread. Cannot understand why.

  Second, with this same pdf file, I cannot get pstotext, ps2ascii or
prescript to successfully disassemble the postscript file to a text file.
All this used to work, of course. The postscript file was created on a
Microsoft system at a federal agency.

  I've looked on the cmu "Gallery of Adobe Remedies", but that discusses
protected pdf files. I've found three different versions of prescript (-0.1,
-2.2 in python and one in perl) but no docs or explanation of why they may
not be working.

  The last time I tried to build ghostscript-7.07 from the .src.rpm, I ran
into a big bunch of compatibility problems with the existing 6.52
installation.

  If anyone is good with this type of conversion among text types, I'd
greatly appreciate some guidance or other help.

Thanks,

Totally different PS generators, thus different PS code.  Differences in
graphics rendering and compression become significant here.

Sounds like you're stuck with extracting bitmaps (GS can print to TIFF and
other formats) and feeding 'em through an OCR program.

  No! And that threw me for a loop. I thought that I could cut and paste if
I couldn't disassemble.

  Oy, vey! Anyone have gocr or jocr running well? What I'll need to do is
convert _all_ these multi-hundred page documents into something I can use.
Groan!

Aaron,

  The 'gs' man page doesn't show the option for output to .tif. Do I just
need to specify that on the command line? Hmm-m-m. I'll try it.

I don't think CVS allows this, but I'd love to be proven wrong...

  I don't recall who recommended cyberguys.com for the mini keyboard, but I
want to thank you very much. My order arrived today and I finally have a
keyboard that lets me sit in front of the monitor (rather than offset to the
left) and I really like it. The layout is identical to that on my Toshiba
Portege notebook, so I'll eventually get used to hitting the backspace key
rather than the home key on both. :-)

I'd vote for the removal of Reply-To munging *if* somebody can figure

Otherwise, I'll prefer my lists munged.

To tell you the truth, I'm not sure how to check or set this in Red

  Thank you, Aaron, for setting me on the right path. I've done the first
part now: the conversion. Rather than use ghostscript I used 'convert' with
the .ps as the input file and .pnm for the output file. Took quite a while,
but there it is. Now, ... on to gocr!

Subject: [PLUG] Can anyone rationally explain Open Office Presentor Stlye behavoir?
Message-ID: <1064884330.580.22.camel@kat>

[I am using ximian's rc4 of 1.1, but this happens all the time to every
version I have used.]

So I make a set of slides.

I use outline mode.

When I indent the outline level it changes the style (makes text
smaller).
When I modify the style, it modifies the text.

[This step may or may not be important]
Then I create a new slide.
I attempt to copy the slides from file 1 (open) to 2
It crashes


Now I save 1 as v3, and start to edit.

Now all the fonts are willy nilly.
When in outline mode, it uses the last font for the outline.  So if I am
sitting on the slide title, hit return, hit move right/indent/move in
outline, it stays at the title font, size, and attributes.  I can modify
the styles in present, which now have no bearing on the text.  If I
indent, it changes the bullet, but not the style.  

More often than not I cannot click on fill format mode (paint bucket). 
I read the help which says:

        Applies the selected style to an object on your slide. Click the
        paint bucket icon and then click an object in your slide to
        apply the style. Click the paint bucket icon again to exit this
        mode.

This does not appear to be true....


[Other factors]

For some reason it saved file 1 and file 2 as powerpoints.  I have no
idea why.

[History]

This has cost me untold hours of re-formating time for all the talks I
do. 

Can anyone explain how openoffice is *supposed* to work?

Thanks.  Sorry if this note is hard to follow, I am a bit frustrated.

About a month ago I bought one of the noname 17" flatscreens at Fry's
for my mother-in-law. Worked right out-of-the box with RH9 (where it
needed the CD supplied drivers for Windows 2000). However, the picture
was so blurry that I exchanged it against a Phillips that was on sale
that day. She's happy with that one now.

The problem with Fry's is that they use splitters to feed several
monitors from one computer. That prevents the customer from evaluating
the quality of the picture. 

BTW, I have yet to see a reasonable priced LCD that properly displays
gray shades. Does that exist?

Subject: [PLUG] The battle for IOmega Ext. USB 250 Drive
Message-ID: <200309291610.10807.guy1656@ados.com>

This is REALLY getting frustrating:

I have an IOmega External ZIP drive (250MB)

It is simply a bitch to connect to my Mandrake 9.0 Box.

A good friend who first set up the system for me set it up so that I could 
jist type "mount /mnt/zip" from a command window and it would behave, just 
like say, mounting a floppy disk.

Then the computer changed, and figgured out how to disobey the command. Months 
ago, when I posted to this forum, a kind soul suggested:

 mount -t vfat /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part4 /mnt/zip

... and that was miraculous. Then one day it too stopped working. The computer 
had figured out a way to beat me again.

So I installed VMWare and run W2K inside it. Because file system sharing in 
VMW 4.0 is straightforward enough for me to learn, I could fire up W2K, plug 
in my zip drive and have an info-box pop up ("W@#$# has found new Hardware: 
ZIP 250") and I could transfer files from the zip drive to my home directory 
(or whereever.)

Then computer got wise that I was actually getting things done, and I learned 
about "rmmod usb-storage" and "modprobe usb-storage."

But the computer has beaten me again: now VMWare won't even 'see' the USB 
drive when I plug it in.

MY QUESTION:

Is there an rpm (download & double-click to install, from your file system 
GUI) that will allow the ZIP drive to operate as flexibly as PLUG-n-PLAY is 
supposed to be? (OK, I'll tolerate one or two shell commands such as 
'mount.')

Hi All,
        Ive searched high and low but have not been able to find a
solution to this problem. For the background, I run a photo web
server(around 600 pages or so and growing) at my home for a track club
here in the Portland area. They recently acquired their own domain-name
and I need
to replace all the homepage links in the HTML with the updated address.

ex. replace www.foobar.com/RCTC/ with www.RCTC.com/

        My question is..... is there an easy way to do this other than
the obvious highlight and pasting of text?

        I'm using MDL9.1 and Apache.

        Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Are these links scattered through 600 static html pages and not done via 
SSI's or some other dynamic method?  Oof..

I'm sure there's a perlish or sed way to do it but I'd probably use my 
editor's multi-file search and replace so I can see what's going on with 
each replacement, just in case your matching pattern doesn't properly 
match some instances of the link.

Alex, 

I'm sure Paul Heinlein et al. will offer you some mind warping Perl
stuff, but if you feel comfortable with running a Java tool, I've
written one to replace text in multiple files. It can be run with a
little dialog or in the console. Scripting is also possible with a
config file for recurring tasks. It can also replace XML attributes and
other XML stuff. 

You can download it here: http://selover.net/~holger/tmp/sandpiper.zip

I am not usually a Perl advocate, but Perl has an option to do
in-place editing (the -i option, I think).  Probably some combination
of that and a perl-ified sed expression sounds like "appropriate
technology" in this case.

On the other hand, appropriate combinations of grep, backtick and sed
at Mr. Shell would also work.

It worked out of the box with RH7.3, 9, and console mode.

While not Linux related I can speak to this directly.

Merely having child porn is not enough to convict.  You must be shown
that you know you have child porn.  Unfortunately that can be enough. 
Thus the reporters and researchers who have been prosecuted.

BTW, having worked a few cases,  there is usually *very* little doubt
when you have child porn on a machine.  Cases are not won on 1 images,
but often 100's, and 1000's.

I have seen some very air tight cases with 10's to 100's thrown out on
various technicalities.

So while it is possible to abuse civil rights in the name of protecting
children (i.e. get warrants, make people cough up information, change
laws), it is harder to actually jail someone based on the scenario
above.

The devil is in the details, but a quick hack that outlines the issues:

First we must list the files, then edit each file to a temp file, then
move the temp file over the original:

find /path/to/website/files -type f -exec sed -e 's/www.foobar.com\/RCTC\//www.RCTC.com\//g' {} > {}.sed \; -exec mv {}.sed {} \;

find find all files in the path given
  -type f says look at files.
  -exec save exec this until the \;
    {} is the filename being looked at (find subs in)
    sed runs the regex (-e) on the script
       the \ is to protect the / from looking like the end of the regex
       g says do global (i.e. work more than once a line).
     
Having not tried this I bet it fails for any of the following reasons.

I failed to escape the redirection '>'
The {}.sed does not work.
the second exec does not happen.
You have binaries with the expression in them.
You have other things besides links with the regex search pattern.
You have mixed case links.

So make sure you do this on a *copy* first.

For a fairly common thing to do, I have have not seen a common util to
do it.  Often the details cause this approach to work.  I know some web
editors will do this for you.

Guess what New does :)

One nice thing is the definition of Next Style.  That means your
"first_page" style can always be followed by your "other_pages" style,
and other_pages are also followed by other_pages.

This can be used for number restarting and things like that.

According to Camel (2ed), page 332, you want something like:

   perl -p -i.bak -e "s/foo/bar/g;" <filenames>

If you've got a whole subtree of potential files to fix, get the
filenames to use with a recursive grep:

   grep -rl 'foo' . | xargs perl -p -i.bak -e "s/foo/bar/g;"

Lurking gurus welcome to correct as needed.  

Test before applying to valuable data.

Section 3: Six Wednesdays, October 15 - November 19 from 5:00 - 7:00 PM
at The OGI School of Science & Engineering at OHSU (Beaverton/Hillsboro)

Use game development to unlock the mystery of 'good' computer code. 

You will deconstruct and analyze the inner workings of the computer game
3-D Pong. This process will teach you about object-oriented design, data
logging and analysis, visual math and the intricacies of designing
user-friendly programs. By the end of the class, you will modify and add
to the game engine or design a multi-player computer game. 

Dr. Pavel Boychev of the University of Sophia in Bulgaria developed the
instructional game and engine.

  Create a video game using the technology of Game Maker. Learn how to
design and modify your own exciting PC game by studying examples from
Game Maker and analyzing the codes used. 

Begin by looking at basic games like Pong, then move up to more
intricate examples and coding language. With this understanding, you'll
learn how to control characters, objects and outcomes in your game, then
increase the difficulty level and add more features. If you've always
wanted to design a speed racing game or a version of PacMan, Mario, or
Dragon Drop, this class will provide the techniques you need. 

Game Maker is a freeware game engine designed by Dr. Mark Overmars of
the Computer Science Department of the University of Utrecht. 



INSTRUCTOR: Edwin Pilobello, a programmer for over 25 years, is a
Microsoft and Visual NQC Developer and Robolab beta-tester. 

GRADE LEVELS: 5 - 8 

TUITION: $145  

Edwin uses a set of free/share ware programs to teach with.  I recently
met with Edwin and he would love to see Linux ports of this language.

Contact me off list for more info.

I'm trying to control who can send mail to my host without blocking
valid email or making it overly difficult to increase the number of
people who can contact me through email.  Specifically, I latched on to
the PTR test thinking spammers love to use addresses that aren't
properly registered in dns.  Unfortunately, it appears that PCC isn't
properly registered either.  Is it pretty much settled that the
PTR check recommendation in rfc 2505 should be ignored?

Postfix has some ability to check dns based user maps, should I use
this and if so what should I set up?  I have the email addresses of
people that must get through to me.  To get pluglist through I
added it to mynetworks, there is probably a better way.
Considering the PTR checking has stopped most if not all the
trash, I like it unless there's a better way to do the same 
thing.  

In some cases to set up a mailing list for example it might make
sense to blacklist all people trying to send to it explicitly
whitelisting the people who are list members so that only 
trusted people can post.

Can spamassasin stop unsolicited or hostile connections based on 
content or does it only figure out what to throw away after it 
has been loaded down from wherever?  The latter can create the
impression a message is getting received which is something 
noone wants to portray when it comes to spam.

Would it be better to substitute greylisting for PTR checking? 
Something I read said that a lot of spam programs only transmit 
once where legitimate email sources will retransmit.  Essentially,
assume that a server that will retransmit is more trustworthy than 
one that won't.

One classmate got through to me, but evidently PCC addresses in 
general can't.

At one point if I have to receive spam I'm going to want a filter
to detect offensive patterns in email affectively and discard
those messages or at least move them out of the good stuff.

  This is not obvious; I learned this from a response on the OO.o users
list.

  True. Now try saving it and applying the new style to a template.

  It turns out that one needs to open the template for which the new page
style is intened to be applied (in my case, the 'letter' template with the
new page style as continuation pages).

  Now one can open the stylist (menu or F11), right-click for the menu and
create a new page style. After saving it, go to the template document and
add the new style in the Format > Page dialog box. Now it will be there.

  Also, by trial and error, I discovered that I needed to hit return until
the cursor moved to the next page in order to enter the information needed
in the header of the continuation pages. Saved modified style and went to
bed.

  One of the development team asked me to file a bug report because the
on-line help has nothing on creating a new style -- only how to create one
from selected text. So, I'll file a sharp point on the report for them.

Thanks,

Here's what I'd do, assuming that your example is correct. Let's say
that the documents are all in /var/www/rctc/public_html.

  #!/bin/sh
  #
  # out with old, in with the...
  oldurl="www.foobar.com/RCTC/"
  newurl="www.RCTC.com/"
  # make a backup copy of the document root
  mkdir /tmp/rctc
  cd /var/www/rctc
  tar cf - ./public_html | ( cd /tmp/rctc && tar xf -)
  # using the backup as a base, overwrite the production copies
  cd /tmp/rctc
  for f in $(grep -lr "$oldurl" public_html); do
    sed -e "s!$oldurl!$newurl!g" < $f > /var/www/rctc/$f
  done
  # make sure any remaining foobar references are valid
  grep -r 'www\.foobar\.com' /var/www/rctc/public_html/*

If something goes horribly wrong, you can always restore the temp copy
of the tree to the production environment. Otherwise, delete the temp
tree and head off to enjoy a cold beverage of your choice. :-)

I'd love to help out, Rich, but are those distro dependant? If you want to send 
me your distro version, off list to avoid controversy, I'll see if I have one of 
those...

WOW! Thanks everyone. Printing this all out as I type. I'm definitely
not a Perlmonger but I'll back up and try anything once. To answer a few
of the questions, yes they are all static pages although I did use a
small program to build them and I did hack the CSS page to get the right
color for the background. The pages are nested and here is the link for
anyone that interested to see what I've done.

Mike,

  I doubt that it's dependent on the distribution (which is RH 7.3 on this
box). I believe that the library name with the longest string is the "real"
file and all the shorter ones are symlinks. Here's what I have:

[root at salmo /usr/lib]# ll libcups*
-r--r--r--    1 root     root       853680 May 27 10:56 libcups.a

-r--r--r--    1 root     root       519154 May 27 10:56 libcupsimage.a
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root        95078 Jun 13 11:04 libcupsimage.a.O*
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           17 Jun 14 07:14 libcupsimage.so -> libcupsimage.so.2*

lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           19 Mar  6  2003 libcupsimage.so.O -> libcupsimage.so.2.O*

  So, I want to confirm that libcups.so.2 is the real file and
libcups.so.2.O should be a symlink, not an 800K file. Similarly with
libcupsimage.so.2.O. But, before I step on my toes and trip myself up I want
to confirm this.

Thanks,

Rich

If this is the case, how did it used to work?  Are these new/different PS
files than before?

How are the PS files actually created?  Do you have any control over that
process?  I.e. could you get them to stop pasting images of text into Word
before they print and run it through their own OCR first like they used
to?  ;-)

galen,

  Because I am writing this document for one agency to submit to another
agency on the former agency's letterhead. Therefore, I need to send it to
them in winWord format. If it was intended for submission on paper I'd use
LyX/LaTeX (which I'm getting to know _really_ well as I write my book).

  Besides, I write my letters with OO.o because it's much easier than
learning the idiosyncrasies of letter writing in LaTeX. Perhaps once I
create my letterhead as a graphic file for inclusion in a LaTeX letter I'll

This really should be the most reliable way of mounting the thing.  As
far as I can tell, there could only be four things that might have
changed;  the bus number, the target number, the lun number, or the
partition number.  The partition number will only change if you have
repartitioned the disk, try part1 instead.  The lun number probably
didn't change (I think only real scsi buses use it).  The target number
may have changed if you have plugged in some other USB device that acts
like a block device, try target1 instead.  The bus number might have
changed if you have plugged the drive into a different USB port, try
bus1 instead.

The log file should help out (/var/log/syslog), it should let you know
what it finds when the drive is plugged in.

About the only thing I can think of is hotplug, but it most likely is

Message-ID: <20030930182103.D0E0D8F03@tinman.seitzassoc.com>

Yesterday I decided switch to a usb keyboard and mouse.  Should be
simple these days, eh?  I was running a 2.4.20 kernel that I compiled
myself.  After connecting the keyboard, everything was fine in the bios
and grub, but the keyboard was dead after the kernel booted.  When I
switched back to redhat's 2.4.20 kernel, the keyboard would work.  I
checked my usb modules against the working redhat kernel.  Everything
seemed fine.  Extensive searching on google found that some people,
perhaps those with Via hardware, had usb keyboard problems around
2.4.20.  To make a long story short, the keyboard started working after
I moved to 2.4.22.

Maybe this will save someone here a few hours.

If you installed an rpm, you can do

$ rpm -q --whatprovides /usr/lib/libcups.so.2

mine returns,
  cups-libs-1.1.14-15.4

then,
$  rpm -qilv cups-libs

-rwxr-xr-x    1 root    root           111655 May 13 03:06 /usr/lib/libcups.so.2
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root    root            75802 May 13 03:06 
/usr/lib/libcupsimage.so.2

but there is one softlink libcupsdconf.so
so,
$ rpm -q --whatprovides /usr/lib/libcupsdconf.so
kdelibs-3.0.5a-0.73.2

and,
$ rpm -qilv kdelibs |grep libcups
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root    root           274709 Jul 14 07:57

/usr/lib/libcupsdconf.so -> libcupsdconf-gcc2.96.so


Remember you need to use full path/filename for the -q switch.

Subject: [PLUG] contacts into Evolution
Message-ID: <1064947272.1142.30.camel@rhws.theplatinumrule.com>

I'm dumping my Opera addresses into evolution. Evolution does not have
an Opera importer.

I've reformatted the list into a name, address format, and saved it in
HTML. I e-mail the doc to myself and view it inline in evolution. That
gets me a lot of the way there, now I can right click the address and
add it to my address book. The only thing that doesn't make it is the
name. 

How do I get evolution to attach the name to the address so that it adds
both at the same time, saving me the cut and paste?

Is there another way, like making the addresses into mbox format?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0309301219520.16085-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

Since I got, first a hardware firewall with serial port (for a modem) and
then DSL I haven't had to deal with doing a dialup connection on a linux
box.  Back in the olden days I used diald which worked quite well but as
the kernel and distributions progressed diald seemed to disappear.  What
I've seen now requires manually making the connect and manually dropping
the connection or leaving it on full time.

We just got a call for setting up a SUSE machine and I've never dealt with
it besides looking at the box and watching someone else install it
stand-alone.
    Anyone using dialup access using just their distributions tools?  If
not what are you using?  I'm interested in all distributions and tricks.


TIA,
Rod

I once used kppp with SuSE and it surely must still be

Subject: [PLUG] Canadian major ISP appear to be blocking a website
Message-ID: <20030930201602.69984.qmail@web20003.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,
  I'm tech rep on a website hosted in Portland by a linux group (linuforall) maintainer who has a direct dsl line to the net.
  The website owner has no, or irregular access to the site, and thus to his mail server as well. All other customers of the same isp Shaw Cable in Vancouver Canada have no access to his site either. Customers of ISP Telus DSL all have access. I have reliable access here, as do friends in Canada, USA and abroad. 
  His ISP claims the web host may be blocking them, or a DNS "push" may be the problem. So far they are looking into it, but claiming it isn't their problem. 
  The LUG web-hoster has confirmed he blocks no one.
  Without asking legal advice, my questions are
1) Does the technology exist (major ISP hardware and software) to block access to individual sites? Is it possible? Can it 'reasonably' happen by accident, or only intentionally?
2) Who would be best web contact orgs responsible for controlling, preventing or stopping such censorship, not just whining about it? (yes I am googling - so vast)
  The website owner previously discovered this same company doing religious censorship in their public kiosk computer terminals and has a Canadian Radio telecommunications Commision (CRTC) complaint over those events as do I. 
  His business is suffering due to his inability to access his website and mail.
  
Thanks all.
Marc

Thanks.  A starting point.  Do you know or remember if it handled
disconnects due to inactivity and/or connect when it detects the need?

Does anyone know what the topic of the next PLUG meeting
will be? All I know is that the meeting will be held this
Thursday at PSU.

(Maybe Dave will be presenting it on the topic ``How to get
people to remove their old computer hardware from your
garage in time for the closing date of your house" ;-)

At this rate, I will have the information for the Advanced
Topics meeting up on the PLUG web site *long* before the
general meeting.

Question 0 ought to be, What troubleshooting steps can he take to
document the problem?

* Run a traceroute from his home computer to www.linuxforall.com to
  ensure that basic routing is in place. It may be that the ISP's
  internal routing tables are mucked up.

* Run dig/host in various ways against linuxforall.com and
  findmoore.net to ensure the nameservers, mail exchanges, etc. are
  configured correctly.

My cursory reading is that DNS is misconfigured for these domains.

Two of the four NS records for both domains point to non-existent
hosts:

  [tmp]$ for h in $(dig linuxforall.com ns +short); do host $h; done
  ns1.findmoore.com has address 208.187.227.114
  Host ns2.findmoore.net not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
  Host ns3.findmoore.net not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
  ns0.findmoore.com has address 208.187.227.113

Of the two valid names, one doesn't have a valid reverse pointer:

  [tmp]$ host ns1.findmoore.com
  ns1.findmoore.com has address 208.187.227.114
  [tmp]$ host 208.187.227.114
  Host 114.227.187.208.in-addr.arpa not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)

Additionally, the primary and secondary MX servers for linuxforall.com
are the same host:

  [tmp]$ dig linuxforall.com mx +short
  20 smtp.linuxforall.com.
  10 mail.linuxforall.com.
  [tmp]$ host smtp.linuxforall.com
  smtp.linuxforall.com has address 208.187.227.113
  [tmp]$ host mail.linuxforall.com
  mail.linuxforall.com has address 208.187.227.113

At this point, I'm more likely to believe the trouble is a DNS
misconfiguration than any form of censorship, intentional or
otherwise.

The following procmail directive works for me and my mutt:

   # re-munge PLUG list's reply-to headers while sorting
   :0:
   * ^List-Post:.*plug at lists.pdxlinux
   | /usr/bin/formail -R "Reply-To" "X-Reply-To" >> l-plug

It may not be *pure* (since there's no "Reply-To" at all after it's done,
I'm assuming it must use the "From" header), but it does work.


- Paul, who can't take credit for the above hack. Someone else here
thought of it first.

I did several months, well actually many months ago, and it seems to have
gone stale - really stale.  It is up to version 1.0 but the docs (FAQs)  
reflect version 0.16.5.
   Diald was great when I used it.  In fact I installed it for several 
businesses and churches years ago.  I believe some are still using it but 
the slip gateway interface wasn't optimal and using the TUN (or another 
interface which I can't remember) wasn't documented worth diddly.  I then 
got, as I mentioned, a hardware firewall and diald wasn't needed any more.

Sad long store that.  The real downer is diald doesn't appear to be 
included with any distribution so it has to be found, packaged (floppy, 
CD), then loaded and configured.
   Well I might be doing this for our customers.  We anticipate an 
increase in linux users and in fact advertise we support Linux (just 
servers at this time  :-).

Thanks for reminding me of the sourceforge project.

First of all check to see if the site is on any RBLs. samspade.org checks all

Sure, it's common to block by IP as a means of spam or content control. It 
could happen 'accidentally' if the site is part of larger netblock that is 
being blocked. There are also all kinds of content filters, like Net Nanny.

"My server, my rules". If a private ISP wishes to filter traffic, that's their 
privilege. Absent any law compelling them to allow your traffic on their 
network, they don't have to. But you probably want to find out for sure 
before anything else. Like ask them directly?

I previously used diald as well.  What I remember from the tail end of
that time period was that demand dialing capabilities of ppp were
becoming preferred over diald.  Have you investigated the current linux
ppp implementation?  It may already do what you want.

Galen, Paul;

Thanks for the reminder.  I'll look at it again but the last time, two
years ago, it was a pain.  Not sure if that was a RedHat-isms or some
basic problems with WvDial.
   I'll probably have to get back into this so I can help users or at

Heh.
Likely, these folks are opening the file in Wurd and printing to the Adobe
Acrobat PDF print driver, which looks like a printer but generates PDFs.
I don't know what particular setting would make that combo generate bitmap
PDFs, but it sounds like they've unfortunately hit on it.  If you can
figure out exactly what to change, and who to ask nicely, you might be
able to get 'em to change it on the grounds that the PDFs will then be
much smaller, thus making 'em available to folks with dialup.  Heck, they
may even be small enough to fit on a floppy.

So Michael, you ever feel like you are tilting at windmills?

I've been down this path, and I decided that banging my head 
against the monitor did not offer sufficient yields.

There seem to be very few fundamental rules of the internet. Just
about the time you think you have things nailed down, all the
rules change. Well, most of the rules change - you can trust
that a few of the rules will remain the same.

Take DNS for an example. There have been all sorts of cool tricks
done with DNS over the years. Dynamic DNS, Hesiod, all those weird
things active directory does, IP over DNS, etc, etc. The one constant
throughout the history of DNS is that everyone gets it wrong.

The expectation that every domain's DNS should be 100% correct is the
path of a long and painful net experience.


Rather than trying to add your own DNS records for every site on the
net that does not meet your expectations, you may want to reallocate
that time to investigating alternate paths.

Spam detection has become an advanced science. There is a significant
body of recent anti-spam literature available that is much more likely
to lead you to the spam-free nirvana than the crude methodology of
relying on correct PTR records.


-Eric

The purpose of DNS is to identify hosts and networks 
without having to know ip addresses.  If trusted responsible 
authorities took care of the PTR zones for all Internet 
sites, that would help.  Fortunately, it looks like I 
finally got Postfix's access table hooked up allowing 
me to punch addresses I know I shouldn't block through.  

I suppose I can do a program that filters email after 
receiving it, but I want to block the data rude people
want to send me.  Internet clients need 
reliable dns, face it that having to use the numbers 
would be absolutely ridiculous and highly error prone
especially considering that so many of the numbers are
in address pools.

The alternative is to throw away source as a filtering
criteria and accept connections from anywhere.  This 
approach cannot address denial of service from mail 
floods though.

Is there no way to encourage sites to set up DNS
correctly?  Is dns a hopelessly untested system?
It's seems ridiculous that people are giving up
on determining intent before allowing anyone to 
connect to their server and inject data or
programs into it.  Maybe a filter will keep
the inbox clean, but downloading a message and
the deleting it without any intention of 
reading it is downright inefficient.

I found this link on www.rpmfind.net and is a link to a relatively new 
version of SUSE (I think).

ftp://216.254.0.38/linux/SuSE-Linux/i386/8.2/suse/src/diald-1.0-187.src.rpm

This is a binary version also.

The interface it used was, IIRC, ethertap.  You could manage more that 
just ppp links.  And I liked the diald-ctl tool to monitor the link in 
real time.  Truely a shame it is not being developed anymore.

PTR records point an IP address back to name. Your average
shmuck only cares about A & CNAME records, the mappings of
a name to the IP address. From time-to-time, you find someone
who knows what a MX record is.

Reverse lookups seem to be a fading fad.

Converting a name to an IP is handled by A & CNAME
records. As we are all too-painfully-aware, the 
internet can indeed function without PTR records,
more often than not anyways.

Huh? What exactly is the correlation between spam,
PTR records, IP addresses, and DOS attacks?  If the
lack of PTR records leads to indefensible DOS attacks
we're all in trouble, since the bad-guys are in control
of the PTR records...

I have read only a small portion of this on-going
thread, so I may have missed something important,
but from my statistical sampling all I've seen have
been comments about how 100% correct DNS is required
for proper spam filtering.

If my impression is correct, you need to sit down
awhile and think through the implications of spam
being sent from servers with correct DNS information.

The vast majority of spam I see, and that my users forward
to me, come from "xasd342sdf at hotmail.com", compromised servers
(correct DNS != patched/properly configured servers), and other
such attrocities that have nothing to do with DNS what-so-ever.

Michael, many of us here agree with you that the state of
DNS records tends to be dismal at best. It has been bad
for a long time, and is gradually getting worse. Fight it
if you wish, I wish you luck.

But before you go, re-read this sentence you wrote:

>It's seems ridiculous that people are giving up

>programs into it. 

How much information can you glean from a syn bit?
Is it possible to determine intent before allowing
a connection to your mail exchanger?

Is it possible for the "bad guys" to forge every single
bit of information required to establish a connection?


My comments are not focused on "giving up", they are
intended to point out an approach to this problem that does
not work in most cases. The only thing that whining about
the sad state of DNS seems to accomplish is annoying the
sysadmins on the list who have to live with the sad state
of DNS...

pppd has the "demand" option.  Look into that.

Subject: [PLUG] how to remove usb
Message-ID: <0674JD62LF63GEVRJWVYV09A0FEJIN.3f7a7352@miked>

RH 7.1, I want usb support out. This server will never need it.

This is in the dmesg:
usb.c: registered new driver usbdevfs
usb.c: registered new driver hub
usb-uhci.c: $Revision: 1.251 $ time 20:53:29 Apr  8 2001
usb-uhci.c: High bandwidth mode enabled
PCI: Found IRQ 12 for device 00:04.2
usb-uhci.c: USB UHCI at I/O 0xd400, IRQ 12
usb-uhci.c: Detected 2 ports
usb.c: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
hub.c: USB hub found
hub.c: 2 ports detected


I cannot find any package, man file or anything that has anything to do with 
these. It looks like I could remove all of the usb devices from /dev and the init 
script would not load it, but that seems crude.

Any other suggestions?

This reminds me of RFC 3514[1].  Once that is more widely implemented,
I think all our problems will go away.

Recompile your kernel without USB support, remove Hotplug if it's
installed, and then any USB utilities RH may have installed (although I
really don't know what those might be).

Then you'll be USB free.  :-)

Subject: [PLUG] latest RH kernel
Message-ID: <WRKFOI5Y74EB2WC8D0QHEKJUT5YUPE0.3f7a76c6@miked>

So, I've got this RH 7.1 system I admin about 70 minutes from my house, when 
there's no traffic. I'm a good sysadmin, so I keep it patched.

It goes down occasionaly, I think there's a very marginal glitch in the swap 
partition. While I'm convincing the customer to replace the server or upgrade it 
to use SCSI drives, it goes down today. On reboot, it has fits and runs a couple 
of hours and locks up. Starts spewing all kinds of IDE errors. I'm thinking that 
the drive is going catastrophically. The customer can't wait another 20 minutes 
for me to show up on site and tries another reboot. This time, it wants a system 
disk. Cr--, I'm thinking. It's dead. Customer had set the drive to none in the 
BIOS.

I take the errors that I got over the phone, and google them. Turns out that the 
newest kernel does not like the PII, PIIx based IDE controller. Rebooted with the 
last kernel, and, viola, no more IDE errors.

Hope this helps somebody. I know it's bad to leave unknowns un-rebooted, but it's 
so easy to do when it's not handy to watch it reboot.

Recompile your kernel.  The overhead is probably minimal though.

I hope to never (never say never) compile a kernel. Isn't there an easier way?

Hotplug is not installed.
