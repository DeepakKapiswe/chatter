Dick,

   I don't understand why you chose that product. They've certainly
re-organized their web site and product naming since selling the company,
but that looks like an enterprise product that's meant to be used by
multiple people simultaneously.

   Several years ago they forked their one product into the "workstation"
version and the "enterprise server" solution. I've been using the former
since version 0.7 or 0.8 and now have 5.5 installed. It's been hosting
win98se for seeral years and does just fine. I suspect that you don't need
the server edition. And, the workstation (look under Products->Developers,
that's where it's now tucked away) is sufficiently expensive by itself.

   The server will partition your hard drive into multiple virtual machines.
Is that what you want? The workstation will install into an existing linux
partition and let you install a guest OS that's there when you need it.

Let me add to this that VMWare has a free PLAYER and a free SERVER
product.  I made heavy use of the free player until I recently
discovered the free server.  The server is an awesome product.  It
allows you to run your VMs on a remote machine, and attach to them using
the remote console (also free).  This splits the CPU time between 2
machines.  The machine running the guest OS does not have to deal with
the display, and the machine dealing with the display does not have to
deal with the running processes.  This arrangement gives me a great
performance boost.  Also, you can simply X out of the console, and the
VMs stay running.  It's like screen for virtual machines.

Go to http://www.vmware.com/products/server/ and get that puppy!  Or, if
you are running gentoo, simply do:

emerge app-emulation/vmware-server
emerge app-emulation/vmware-server-console
emerge app-emulation/vmware-modules
env-update
source /etc/profile
vmware-config.pl

Carlos,

   How interesting! Neither of those existed when I started using VMware.
Since the workstation does what I need, I stick with it. The only reason I
upgrade is to get support for a kernel that's not in the installed version.

   So, I guess the free server is the way for most folks to go.

My boss actually paid for my VMWare Workstation license 9 or 10 months
ago ($400 so I could run windows, so I could check my mail, because they
won't turn on IMAP, thus preventing me from using pine).  When I found out
about the free server, I put it on a spare machine under the pretense of
setting up a testbed for bug tracking software evaluation.  I quietly
moved my windows workstation over there, and have been running remotely
ever since.

They did buy me 2G of RAM to make my box run better with VMWare.  That's
why I am keeping the move quiet - I don't want to give up the RAM.

I actually had a paid license for Workstation on my workstation at work,
but when the free ($) Server was released I switched--because with
Workstation I cannot detach/close the console to my VMs and logout of my
desktopX  session, but since the console and the VM server are decoupled
on Server, I can.

Wil,

   That's not an issue for me; two legacy apps that I use on very rare
occasions. But, how difficult is it to move the embedded guest OS and all
applications from the Workstation to the Server?

VMWare guest OSes can be copied around with ease.  I never tested it,
but I believe you can even copy a guest created under a linux VMWare
host to a windows host and vice versa.

I have run guest OSes created with VMWare Workstation under both the
free player and server.

Not difficult at all, I had VMWare images from VMWare Workstation 4 that
moved just fine into the free VMWare server. You just point VMWare server
at the (host) filesystem location for the Workstation images.

Unfortunately all the other connections available here are only at 3 megs up and down. Bummer eh....  I've pulled down torrents and other files a lot faster than that.  I do think that they could ease up a bit.  But I also think that they had to ?make a deal? with the powers that be to get the big network built.  I think FTTC will help with the price and maybe even the restrictions.  I definitely have my fingers crossed.

I don't think it's a big priority.  They don't have to do it.  The AT&T backbone does it to them.  It does it to all of them. Most forms of  traffic go over that thing.  Thanks to some of the laws that have come out of D.C. in the last few years.  If they really want us.  They have all of us.

Steve,

   That's good to know for the next time I need to upgrade so that VMware
continues to run on whatever kernel is installed. I have the files in their
own filesystem, /vm/win98/, and it's nice to know that all I need is
installation of the Sever somewhere on the box and pointing it to that
location.

Many thanks,

Rich

   Thanks for the insight, Carlos. I see it's a matter of telling
Workstation, Server, or Player where the filesystem and image reside, and
all those applications will use the same setup.

   I appreciate all of you -- starting with Dick Steffen's travails -- making
me aware of frugal options with VMware. I use it so infrequently that the
upgrade price is disproportionately high compared to value returned. But, I
need access to the two apps.

The directory of kernel headers (version @@VMWARE@@ UTS_RELEASE) does not match
your running kernel (version 2.6.18).  Even if the module were to compile
successfully, it would not load into the running kernel.

Okay, I compiled a new kernel from vanilla source off of kernel.org.  I removed
kernel-devel using rpm.  2.6.18 IS my running kernel.  Did I accidentally turn 
off support for third party modules???  Well, I'll try to check that now...

Message-ID: <1159725178.5545.47.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I am interested in being able to trigger: shutdown, restart, or logging
out remotely.  I share my computer with someone, I don't want to be in
the position of fighting this person for the keyboard in the event that
he/she is impolite.  One option is to try to use a standard telephone
and call into the computer's modem.  Ideally, I should be able to
remotely lock someone out of my system.  I may want my system to
continue running but I want my guest to get off.

Another thought is a custom PCI card and a modified ATX power supply
that is capable of receiving radio signals.  The ATX supply could have
batteries.  He who controls the power can get around a cracker's
software block.

Does anyone make a product for this purpose?

One thing that happens when you get a kernel is that some of the headers are
not defined until you do 'make config'.  Until that time anything the
would normally
use the headers from the kernel tree will normally fail as the CPU
arch is not defined
and that determines which arch headers are linked into the include/linux dir.

Subject: [PLUG] VMware Player and Screen Resolution
Message-ID: <20061002154857.GA4120@gate.kl-ic.com>


I just installed Vmware player on my Linux laptop, with a Win98 guest.
I used the www.easyvmx.com site to generate the .vmx config file.  I 
know the free server provides more features, but for the intended
application I needed ease of installation instead of features.  I will
move to Vmware server if it is known to solve the problem below.

I started with generic vmplayer, and used the VM Tools "windows.iso"
off a demo CD for workstation 5.5 to upgrade the vmplayer guest to
the SVGA drivers.  Much faster, and 800x600x32b instead of 640x480x4b. 
The host screen is 1024x768.

However, I would like to be able to build a "1024x704" virtual screen
for VMplayer, as big as possible.  Is this practical with any of the
VMware tools?  Will the windows drivers permit arbitrary shapes for
screens, or will available vmx_XXXX.drv files for windows guests only
do the standard size screens?   Is there a more capable driver than
vmx_svga.drv for Win98 guests?

Keith

(PS - why Win98?  That is the last windows version that doesn't send
spy info to Redmond, and I have a few licensed copies.  Why windows
at all?  I am participating in the port of a proprietary Windows CAD
tool to open source and Linux.  Exciting details soon.  YAY!).

Why would they?  It's not discussion-oriented mailing-list software,

"Eating your own dogfood" is a great way to end up with stuff that
tastes good to you but is no good for your customer's dogs.

I remember when MS started insisted on using MS SourceSafe for its own
major codebases.  SourceSafe is meant for *small* projects, not major
applications with hundreds of devs.  Code was lost, work was lost,
schedules slipped, and SS devs were universally reviled for having
produced a product that merely did what it was meant to.

If you can ssh into the machine, you can just kill all their
processes.  You could probably write a script that does this
automatically, and then hook it up to some trigger -- a wireless
joystick or similar device, so you wouldn't need to do the "logging in
as root" part.

   A couple of weeks ago, Daniel was kind enough to look into this gtk+2 problem
and offer a solution. Unfortunately, that solution did not work for me.

   This one, from a subscriber to the pilot-link mail list, is simple and it
worked for me! Now all my gtk+2 calendars on this box begin on a Sunday. So,
I pass it on in case others come across the problem.

Reply-To: pilot-link General List <pilot-link-general at pilot-link.org>

Actually, J-Pilot is not at fault here, it is just using the GTK calendar
widget, which itself relies on the locale to determine the first day of the
week.  There was a long thread about this on the jpilot list a while back,
and IIRC there is a bug reported against glibc.  One of the jpilot
developers posted a workaround which works for me.  I got tired of hunting
down the workaround every time I updated glibc, so I eventually wrote down
the required steps, reproduced here.  Adjust the locale as necessary, use at
your own risk, make sure to backup your files, etc.

1) run 'locale -k -c LC_TIME'

This should have a field called week-1stday. In my locale, en_US, using the
latest Gentoo libraries this field is 19971201. December 1st, 1997 is a Monday
which explains why the first day of the week is Monday, rather than Sunday as
it should be.

2) edit /usr/share/i18n/locales/en_US'

Find the line under LC_TIME which has '19971201' and change it to '19971130'.
November 30th, 1997 was a Sunday.

3) re-generate the binary locale data
  'localedef -v -c -i /usr/share/i18n/locales/en_US /usr/lib/locale/en_US'

4) Verify the change took place with 'locale -k -c LC_TIME'

HTH,
Jason

Subject: [PLUG] Synaptic, Ubuntu, removing packages
Message-ID: <893659065.1159896802046.JavaMail.root@fepweb02>

In the Synaptic Package Manager (as it runs under Ubuntu), when I want uninstall a package, I have a choice between "Mark for Removal" and "Mark for Complete Removal".

The help seems ambiguous about which I should choose. A note says to use "Mark for Complete Removal" only for Debian, but since Ubuntu is a Debian derivative, I'm not sure if this applies.

Also, if I choose "Mark for Removal", the Synaptic Package Manager  checks for related packages, which it does not appear to do if I choose "Mark for Complete Removal".

What I want to do is do a clean uninstall of Mysql and then reinstall from scratch. Anyone have any advice?

Thanks.

Most applications keep configuration files in your home folder (or
sometimes elsewhere). In other words, every time you change something
in the app's preferences, your change is saved in a config file
somewhere. Even things like the most recent files you opened with the
app, or the directory you looked in last, are saved somewhere.

If you do a regular removal it removes the program, but not the config
file(s). If you do a complete uninstall it wipes out all of it.

I think there may be other things that a complete removal nukes as well
-- libraries used only by the app, for example.

Go for complete removal, it scrubs the config files too.

I don't know the answer to your question, but windows drivers in general
seem to be pretty limiting in terms of what resolutions they support;
I've never seen one support the equivalent of writing your own modeline
for the X server. But my experience with them is limited.

Does <ctrl>-<alt>-<return> not work in the vmware player, or is there
some reason why fullscreen mode won't work for what you're trying to use
it for?

For the life of me, I cannot find a complete suse 10.1 package mirror
anywhere.  I found lists of mirrors that claim to be "complete", but
browsing them shows that there are only a handful pf packages to be
found there.  mirrors.kernel.org/suse is an example of a "complete"
mirror that looks way too lean.

Does anyone know where I might find a really complete mirror?

I dont know if this is useful but I'm running VMware (the free version). My Linux screen is 1680x1050, the same as my Windows screen. I'm running VMware under Windows and booting Ubuntu as a virtual OS. The resolution comes right up.

It's full screen. If I drop the resolution, I can have a full screen or one that I can move around. I have not been able to get a screen I can move around at the high resolution.

Carlos,

   I have no idea what a "really complete mirror" looks like, but have you
visited http://suse.osuosl.org/suse/i386/10.1/?

I have.  It looks like the rest of the "complete" mirrors out there,
like mirrors.kernel.org/suse .  I would expect to see 4G worth of
packages in a complete mirror.  These fall way short of that.  With my
limited exposure to the suse way of doing things, it is likely that I am
missing something.  If Novell's site lists a mirror as "complete", you'd
think it were true.

Another interesting point comes up: are opensuse packages supported by
Novell?  Can I pull a package from an opensuse mirror site without
rendering the machine support-less?  An even better question: can I
convince my company that debian rocks, and we should quit using heinous
corporate distros?

opensuse packages are as supported as SUSE packages were; they are
becoming one and the same. AFAIK (which isn't a whole lot) the 10.2
version will be called openSUSE[1]. So yes, you ought to be able to
install opensuse packages and get the same level of support as if you
had installed SUSE Linux 9.3 or 10.0 and installed additional SUSE
Linux packages.

That's a question you'll have to answer for yourself. :-) (And no,

I've seen a report that recent versions of nVIDIA's windows driver will
allow you to do just that. Something along the lines of an advanced tab,
or one of their extra programs. Alas this isn't too likely to help with
the problem at hand.

Message-ID: <20061003203648.f134fe5b.johnxj@comcast.net>

OK, if you want to perform skullduggery on others, being invisible has
its points. But when it comes to files in a file browser, it is
definitely uncool.

I have this CD that came with a phonetics textbook. It has 411 MB of
sound files and also numerous PDF files of exercises and stuff.
Everything was fine until today when I went to access some exercises
for Chapter 2. Not there. The pdf files of exercises for the other
chapters are there, but not for Chapter 2. And previously I discovered
that some of the sound files alluded to in the textbook were also
missing. This is on Ubuntu Dapper amd64.

So today, at PSU, I went to a computer lab and slapped the CD in a
drive. Clicking on My Computer revealed that all the missing files are,
indeed, there. There is nothing wrong with the CD.

Windows reports that the CD contains 411 MB of data. Linux says the
same thing.

I copied the entire CD to a folder on my hard drive. But I get the same
results. Some of the files that appear on a Windows computer are simply
invisible.

On this computer I have Nautilus (default file browser), plus Thunar,
XFE, Konqueror and Krusader. I have Krusader set to launch as root. All
of them fail to show the "missing" files. I also navigated
to /media/cdom0 and used ls command, but the "missing" files still do
not show up.

Admittedly I am a dummy when it comes to file ownerships and
permissions, but shouldn't they all at least show up? If I lack
ownership or permissions I won't be able to open, print, save, move,
edit, etc. But the file should be there at least, shouldn't it? What do
I have to do to get to the "missing" files?

Here is an exerpt from this web page...

BEFORE YOU INSTALL READ THIS:

The package manager in SUSE 10.1 is regrettably broken on most systems. 
To correct this you should do the following after you have installed SUSE:

     * Open Yast chose "online update configuration" , click next and 
wait until finished.
     * Press the updater icon on you taskbar/panel
     * If it updates, congratulations, all is well.
     * If it throws up an error. Close it.
     * Follow the instructions in this SDB article or this mail.

You probably also want to read about Using 10.1 and the Most Annoying Bugs.

Could be the reason Yast isn't playing nice.

At the risk of stating the obvious, did you try ls -a to find those missing files? Do you know their names? Could they begin with a period?

Are these "hidden" files, ones that begin with a "."? I don't recall if 
you're using KDE, GNOME, or another tool, but with the KDE file browser, 
Konqueror, click on the "View" menu and then on "Show Hidden Files". 
Most of the time, all those "." files are an annoying thing to look at, 
but once in awhile it helps.

Absolutely; not being able to do network installs and updates would
irritate me no end and I'd run a different distro.

> If this is true, [...]

I just verified the kernel.org url I gave:

  http://mirrors.kernel.org/opensuse/distribution/SL-10.1/inst-source/

works as a yast source (I'd been using a private mirror), both for the
gui and for command line package installs via yast -i by installing
some packages I had neglected to grab (how could I not have installed
nethack?!??! The horror!).

Note that yast treats updates as a seperate source from the
initial installation, though you add them as an installation
source in the smae location. So for the kernel.org mirror, you'd add
http://mirrors.kernel.org/suse/update/10.1/ as an installation source.
(And then you'll wait a while. the libzypp backend in 10.1 is really
hideous, though getting better. I'm hoping it'll be much improved
in 10.2.)

If your 10.1 installation is fresh, you'll probably want to do an
update cycle a couple of times; the first thing it will try to update
is yast/zypp itself, and then the update tool will want to restart.

Note that yast will use an ncurses interface and so can be run through
an ssh session; there's no requirement to be in front of the box to

After further poking around I am coming to the conclusion that the CD
is flaky. 

My Ubuntu laptop consistently fails to display one folder. While at PSU
yesterday I took the CD to a computer lab and stuck it in a Windows
machine. The Windows machine showed everything fine. The CD is from a
book that I bought a week ago. The very first thing I did after
removing the CD from its wrapper was to make a copy of it. And then I
copied its contents to a folder on my hard disk. However, the copy is
exhibiting the same behavior, and the folder is also lacking files.
Plus, my professor said that he was unable to copy the CD to his hard
drive on his Windows XP computer -- which he assumed was a copy
protection thing. Hence, my conclusion that there is something weird
going on with Linux reading CDs, or at least reading this particular
CD, or that there might be a copy protection issue. The latter would be
weird, though, as all the othe folders work fine.

But just now I put the CD into my Windows desktop. It has one SCSI CD
player and one ATAPI CD-RW, both of which are shared, so my plan was to
see if I could copy the CD onto the laptop hard disk from the drive in
the Windows machine over my home network. The Windows desktop machine
is several years old. Neither drive would even mount the CD, or the
copy. So something is going on with the CD. 

I wish I weren't so far fom PSU. I should just go back to the lab,
mount the CD, then e-mail its contents to myself or use my thumb drive.

I want to thank the members of this list for their help with my suse
growing pains, and for their patience with my ill-conceived, opinionated
remarks about certain linux distros.  I am glad to have been proven
wrong where suse is concerned.  People like me need to be put in their
place.

Once I plugged in the provided mirror source, yast worked like a charm,
needless to say.  Yum and apt are available from the provided mirror,
which is a nice added bonus.

I think I can now make a very strong case for my company to dispense
with redhat in favor of suse.  I loooovvve suse.

I would like to hound you good folks with one more question.  I am
trying to determine whether building a custom kernel is supported in
suse.  I already found words to the contrary on redhat's site.  But I
cannot find any explicit verbage on this subject for suse.  Does anyone
know if it's supported to build a custom kernel on a suse enterprise
box?

Absolutely; not being able to do network installs and updates would
irritate me no end and I'd run a different distro.

> If this is true, [...]

I just verified the kernel.org url I gave:

  http://mirrors.kernel.org/opensuse/distribution/SL-10.1/inst-source/

works as a yast source (I'd been using a private mirror), both for the
gui and for command line package installs via yast -i by installing
some packages I had neglected to grab (how could I not have installed
nethack?!??! The horror!).

Note that yast treats updates as a seperate source from the
initial installation, though you add them as an installation
source in the smae location. So for the kernel.org mirror, you'd add
http://mirrors.kernel.org/suse/update/10.1/ as an installation source.
(And then you'll wait a while. the libzypp backend in 10.1 is really
hideous, though getting better. I'm hoping it'll be much improved
in 10.2.)

If your 10.1 installation is fresh, you'll probably want to do an
update cycle a couple of times; the first thing it will try to update
is yast/zypp itself, and then the update tool will want to restart.

Note that yast will use an ncurses interface and so can be run through
an ssh session; there's no requirement to be in front of the box to
configure it.

You definitely will want to read the using suse 10.1 page at
http://en.opensuse.org/Using_10.1 .

My guess would be no, but if you want an informed and official answer from
someone actually speaking for my employer, you should contact Novell's
Sales and Support channels. Sorry I can't be more helpful than that.

What do people use for lex and yacc on Ubuntu Dapper? Thanks.

Ted,

   On my Slackware boxes, /usr/bin/lex is a soft link to /usr/bin/flex. Do
you have the latter without the symbolic link?

The open source equivelants of lex and yacc are flex and bison, respectively.

Assuming you searched for lex and found nothing.

Do you have apt configured for "universe"?
http://packages.ubuntulinux.org/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?searchon=names&version=all&exact=1&keywords=ml-lex
[aka google for ubuntu lex and go for feeling lucky result]
shows ml-lex as the tool of choice as part of the universe repository.

When I just search for lex as part of package description from the Ubuntu site I
see flex is available in the standard repository - that would be a better way to
go.

  Well the whole SuSE distro system is in a mess. You need to download
the ISO's, the update programs are broken and you need to apply a patch 
to get them to work.

Is it possibly a multi-session CD, and that your CD-ROM doesn't work 
well with those?

Fast-Lex for lex, package "flex". There is GNU's Bison, which isn't
entirely backwards compatible, or Berkeley-Yacc; packages "bison" and
"byacc".

Thanks, Rich. I used the Synaptic Package Manager to download flex and gawk and bison . I also added libxml2-dev; I had libxml2 but the php configure wanted the dev version.

So after editing apache's httpd.conf I can now use Firefox to access php files on my own computer! Neat.

A long way yet to go .... is there anyoneout there also starting the journey to LAMP?

If I recall correctly they have a README.SuSE file in their kernel source
rpms that tells how to build a kernel/modules (don't have a SuSE box handy
to check right now though)

Beats me. 

First, others have suggested that it is a . file or folder, but it is
not. After all, this CD accompanies a textbook and is set up for
Windows and Mac users. No . files. As for multisession, I can't imagine
why the publisher would make it a multisession CD. But what do I know?

Second, I later surmised that the CD is just a bad burn, or however the
publisher makes them. Oddly, the CD drives in the computers at PSU seem
to read it the best. The CD has 411 MB on it, and my thumb drive
(FAT32) holds 512 MB, so today I went to PSU and copied the whole thing
to the thumb drive, and from there to the hard disk in the laptop. So
far everything is working correctly now, except that you are supposed
to launch the sound files and pdf files from an html page in your
browser. The html page thinks I'm going to launch something in Windows
to play the sound files. So instead I just look at the URL at the
bottom of the html page to see what file is being called, and then open
it in Audacity. (Audacity has its annoyances, but it happily plays WAV
and AIFF files, which is what the publisher used.)

I did have a major PITA copying the files to the thumb drive using one
of the Windows computers at PSU. Using Explorer, I dragged the whole CD
to the thumb drive and it started copying away. But then it got to a
file it couldn't read and Windows just aborted the whole copy sequence.
No option to continue copying the rest of the files and folders. Hence,
I had to try to copy folder by folder, being careful to recreate the
folders (and half a dozen subfolders).

It was so annoying doing this that I moved to a Mac, thinking that
perhaps its file drag and drop would be more sensible. But I totally
failed as a Mac user. I couldn't even figure out how to get the CD
drive open.

Guess I'm going to have to stick to Linux.

Thanks...I downloaded flex, bison, gawk and libxml2-dev, none of which my Ubuntu had. I had libxml2 but not the dev version. So I have successfully built PHP5 and can run it with apache.

Is anyone else just beginning the journey to LAMP? If so, I'm offering to share war stories...so far things seem to be working ... I want to use PEAR, but have not yet.

Message-ID: <4524D696.8000301@subtend.net>

Would anyone be interested in an informal round-table security discussion?

I have all these best practices and principles, but would like to
discuss what other people are using, and how conditions and process can
be improved.  I could gather a summary of our discussions and turn it
into a presentation for the monthly meeting.

Topics I'm interested in (both listening to and giving my experiences on):

 * Local storage encryption: performance and management
 * Key and passphrase management: multi-employee consulting
environments, change control
 * Passphrase generation
 * Tinfoil-hat vs. practical use of security practices
 * Log/IDS analysis: useful, and time effective methods of parsing large
amounts of data
 * Tying it all together: system, network, application security..
finding the weak points
 * vi vs. emacs (j/k)

I could host this at my place in Tigard.  Probably host it on a Friday
evening this month or early Nov.  If at least 5 others are interested
I'll make preparations.  Keep replies on list if possible.  Interest may
 spark interest. :)

Others of interest to me:

* securing off-site backups
* working with users to determine appropriate security policies
* administrative password change policies and practices
* wireless networking security practices and configurations

Oct 27 and Nov 10 are bad for me; other Fridays seem clear at the 
moment.

VPN setup and termination.
Policies and setups for remote access w/security.

I'm interested but I don't know if I would add much to the discussion except
to ask a lot of questions.

Ok, we have more than 5. :)


----------------------
Informal Security Chat
----------------------

What:

Geeks gather and talk about practical security practices and personal
experiences in attempting to provide a more secure computing
environment.  Emphasis on GNU/Linux, all UNIX's basically apply.

Why:

After working on a recent system with LVM, dm-crypt, OpenVPN, etc., I
was curious how others handled the problems I was trying to solve, to
see the creativity of others and to provide my own experiences to those
who might benefit.

When:

October 20th, 2006

Start gathering around 18:30 to begin at 19:00.  I can go fairly late,
but lets say we cap it at midnight.

Where:

http://www.subtend.net/contact

Informal agenda:

* Local storage encryption: performance and management
* Key and passphrase management: multi-employee consulting
environments, change control
* Passphrase generation
* Tinfoil-hat vs. practical use of security practices
* Log/IDS analysis: useful, and time effective methods of parsing large
amounts of data
* Tying it all together: system, network, application security..
finding the weak points
* securing off-site backups
* working with users to determine appropriate security policies
* administrative password change policies and practices
* wireless networking security practices and configurations

Notes:
* This isn't necessarily a meeting on crypto.  I doubt many of us will
be able to argue the strength and math of Blowfish vs. AES.  Flame wars
such as SSL vs. IPsec are more appropriate. :)
* Please RSVP.  If more than 15 want to show up, there might be a
seating/space problem.

My guess would be no, but if you want an informed and official answer from
someone actually speaking for my employer, you should contact Novell's
Sales and Support channels. Sorry I can't be more helpful than that.

"Supported?"  It seems to me that if you have a compiler and an application for  configuring the kernel, you could do it. Or even build it on another  system.

It gives me greater control over the features built into the binary. It's
possible I might find a prebuilt version that has what I want (MySQL
support), but I feel safer knowing what I get. So I guess the real reason is
lack of knowledge about what a prebuilt version has. I used
--with-mysqli=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config
--with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs on my PHP configure line.

For example, I built apache also because I wanted to ensure I had support
for Dynamic Shared Objects (--enable-module=so on the apache configure
line).

What I'm trying to do is get a dev environment for LAMP, not necessarily to
run LAMP, although of course I will run it. But it's the dev environment I
want. And if I configure/make/make install and things break in the process
and I fix them, then at the end I have that dev environment.

It's also true (I hear but no data to support) that binary distributions do
perform better, however. Some rumor about people using commercial optimizers
for binary distributions, but I'm just starting out on this and performance
is not top on my list, but if all goes well, it will become so!

You know, I had my audio recorder with me... I was going to offer
to audiorecord the whole show and make the sound available to David.

Would there have been any interest in that, or does a presentation
that is primarily visual have any value in having an audio recording?

As I remember, the user that's allowed to use vmware is the one who
installed it.

If you were someone else when you installed it, then you can always go
and fiddle with the ownership of the files.  You might have to change
the file(s) that contain the virtual disk.  You definately must change
the config (.vmx) file.

If you want to give a bunch of people permission to access the vm,
then your best bet is probably to create a group for them, and chgrp
the files.

When I say "supported", I am strictly speaking in the corporate sense.
If I do anything that voids the service agreement, that is unsupported.
It matters not a bit that I will never use the service agreement, ever.

"Supported" also means that there is someone to sue if something goes
wrong.  A corporate palace like my workplace would never use a product
that is made by a non-corporate entity because there is no one to sue if
the product does not work.  This litigational chain provides a sense of
security for those of a coprorate mindset.  The finger must always have
somewhewre to point.  Tux is too cuddly; he makes a poor scapegoat.

Also, there may be a need to add all vmware users to a "vmware" group,
depending on your vmware installation.  On gentoo, for instance, I need
to add myself to the vmware group, else I cannot even run the vmware
executable.  I confess I have never installed the product from a VMWare
CD or tarball downloaded from their site.  I always use the portage
packages.  Perhaps this group constraint is applied by the ebuild.

I've created my first virtual machine. When I try to install Win98SE the

beep I got with the other mother board when I was trying to install SuSE 
10.1.

I can shut everything down cleanly, and when I power off the machine, 
the beeping goes away. When I power back on, the machine acts normally.

I tried changing the drive the virtual machine looks for from hdd, my 
DVD reader, to hdc, my CD-RW burner, but got the same results.

I haven't had a reason to use either drive since the SuSE 10.1 
installation, so I put a CD in the DVD drive to see what would happen. 
SuSE popped up a window asking me if I wanted to open the CD in a new 
window, and when I said yes, it opened a Konqueror file browser window 
that displayed the correct contents of the CD. I get the same results 
with the CD-RW drive.

So now I'm wondering if there's something odd about my drives, and there 
really wasn't anything wrong with the other mother board.

But, the bigger question is, how do I trouble shoot this thing, or find 
a work around. If I can read the CD's, I can copy the contents as an ISO 
file to the hard drive and point VMware there, right?

You can dd the contents of a cd or dvd to an iso file, and tell vmware
that this iso file is your "cd drive".  In fact, this is preferable to
using an actual cdrom drive, as it is much faster to install an OS from.

Working with unix in the business community there are hurdles to 
overcome.  Syncing blackberries, scheduling meetings, etc.

Well today, I found a solution to one of those hurdles.  The web based 
way to share or demo products has always been webex other IE based products.

So next time someone wants you to attend a webex, recommend,

Installs on windows, linux and mac, and just works.

It's probably moot at this point, but there are a number of good free 
third-party CD diagnostic tools available for Windows.  There are 
probably also Linux equivalents, but I haven't had occasion to look 
around for any.  In days gone by, though, I used CDCheck on problematic 
CD-Rs and it worked well.  Thing is, your problem disc might be a 
pressed CD rather than a CD-R, so I don't know if that particular tool 
would be the best bet.  And, of course, PSU might not take kindly to you 
trying to install software on their computers.  I'd be surprised, 
though, if there aren't similar utilities for Linux.

Heh, I had the same problem when I first encountered my mom's iMac.  I 
had all but turned the thing upside down looking for a button to push, 
when she pointed out that the drive opens from a key on the keyboard.  
Sneaky.  Also, I panicked when discovering that the key no longer worked 
after I installed Debian on it -- until I learned about the "eject" command.

Subject: [PLUG] building xchat, missing perl, Ubuntu Dapper
Message-ID: <5c1beu$thkdlg@mxip19a.cluster1.charter.net>

I'm trying to build Xchat and it configures but make tells me it cannot find
-lperl. As far as I can tell I have perl installed. It's not clear to me
from the Synaptic Package Manager what perl library I am missing. Has anyone
built Xchat sucessfully on Ubuntu Dapper? Can anyone tell me what library I
am missing and where to get it? 

 

I can run Xchat-gnome I think successfully although I don't have anyone to
chat with. It comes up and I can see the channels. But I wanted to run the
original Xchat.

 

Here is the message I get..

 

gcc -shared  .libs/perl.o  -L/usr/local/lib
/usr/lib/perl/5.8/auto/DynaLoader/DynaLoader.a -L/usr/lib/perl/5.8/CORE

Subject: [PLUG] Partition analysis
Message-ID: <45270EE2.5080407@comcast.net>

My "new" machine has a nominally 60GB hard drive. Before I installed 
SuSE 10.1 I ran fdisk and deleted all the partitions on it. Then I 
accepted the defaults during the installation. Here's what I have now:

Disk /dev/hda: 60.0 GB, 60022480896 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 7297 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

    Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1               1         199     1598436   82  Linux swap / Solaris
/dev/hda2   *         200        2810    20972857+  83  Linux
/dev/hda3            2811        7297    36041827+   f  W95 Ext'd (LBA)
/dev/hda5            2811        4605    14418306   83  Linux
/dev/hda6            4606        7297    21623458+  83  Linux

I'm not sure why hda2 is as big as it is. I assume there needs to be 
enough room to put stuff for grub, the kernel, and any additional 
kernels I might some day want to create. But, 20GB?

So, before I go messing up the partition table, what's a reasonable size 
for the boot partition?

About Xchat not finding -lperl. I made a link in /usr/lib called libperl.so

Now I'm trying to figure out how to use this program!

 

Sometimes it seems I grew up on a different planet.am I like the only person

Dick,

   What do you see in /etc/fstab? That relates the partition to the
filesystem mounted on it. It will tell you what is assigned where.

   Even better is to type 'df -h'. This shows the partition, mount point, and
size. For example, my server/workstation is set up this way:

Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda1             479M  177M  302M  37% /
/dev/hda10           1004M  265M  740M  27% /tmp
/dev/hda11            3.0G  1.9G  1.1G  65% /vm
/dev/hda12             60G  9.3G   50G  16% /data1
/dev/hda13             22G  7.5G   14G  36% /data2
/dev/hda2              55M   40M   16M  72% /boot
/dev/hda5              15G  5.9G  8.9G  40% /home
/dev/hda6             7.9G  3.4G  4.5G  43% /usr
/dev/hda7              20G  1.8G   18G   9% /usr/local
/dev/hda8              20G  1.1G   19G   6% /opt
/dev/hda9            1004M  482M  523M  48% /var

   Note that /boot takes only 16M (of 55 available); but that's for
Slackware. The /vm partition is where VMware lives.

   Depending on the number of kernels you want available, and their
compression, you could probably be well servered with a 25M /boot.

Odd. /dev/hda2 doesn't show up in these lists on my machine, but it does 
with fdisk, and the machine boots.

Sounds like I could recover 19.5 GB, easily. But I guess I should 
understand why it's not showing up in fstab or with df before I go 
adjusting things.

Have you ever actually *read* a EULA?

There is no software the market that you can use according to its
contract and retain the right to sue.  Not Microsoft, not Macintosh,
not Solaris, not Linux.  Everything comes with a "not warranted to
function" license.  So your suits are smoking rope if they think
they can sue Microsoft if Excel eats the annual report.  They will
get laughed out of court, and possibly countersued when the jackals
of Redmond sics the Business Software Alliance on them.

That said, they can buy better support from Redhat or Novell or
most especially IBM than they can ever get from Microsoft.  They
can ignore that, and watch their more savvy competitors eat their
lunch.  If they are Linux-phobic (and many B-player suits are,
Microsoft paid good money to keep them that way) and feel the
need to waste money, they can buy their support from Sun.  But
IBM can feed them Linux at a high price and give them the highest
reputation service organization in the world.  So the "supported"
excuse for not using Linux is dead in the water.  IBM and Novell
are making the transition to Linux *precisely because* it allows
them to improve their service offering.

Not that you can sue IBM, either.  The IBM legal team is referred
to as the "Nazghul" (the evil demons of Lord of the Rings) amongst
the savvy legal community.  Which is why you want to be on IBM's
side, not on SCO's side.  The hills of Utah will ring with the
shrill screams of Darl McBride for a long, long time.

Message-ID: <659b9ea30610071212n71d57301o4aadac5be2465222@mail.gmail.com>

I have a friend who knows zero about web pages.  She wants to put up a
site.  I am happy to host for her, but I do not want to get into the
day to day management when she needs to put up new pages.  She thinks
MS Publisher will be usable for her.  Does anyone know if there is
software I can use to allow her to publish into the site if I do the
hosting.  I will be on a pure Linux environment.  Does WebDAV work?
Or, does anyone know of a good WYSIWYG in-browser editor that is super
simple to use?  Perhaps TinyMCE?

Thanks,
Chris

According to man df on my system, "If no file name is given, the space 
available on all currently mounted file systems is shown."  So I would 
guess that /dev/hda2 doesn't show up because it isn't mounted.  I have 
two partitions (created recently for an alternate installation) that I 
haven't added to my fstab and have not mounted, and they don't show up 
when I do "df -h".

Seems odd, though, that it wouldn't be in your fstab.

All,

Can anyone recommend good computer repair shop local to portland? Something on
my motherboard is shorting out. I've tested by pulling each component off
except the cpu to no avail. At this point I think it's probably best if I get
someone to look at it.

thanks,

Dan,

   My experiences with Northwest Computer Support in SW Beaverton have been
positive. They fixed one portable and added additional RAM to another. My
only other experiences were with local retailers (one in Beaverton and one
in SE Portland), both several years ago and neither positive.

I'll ditto Rich's comments. I've had several occasions to take equipment 
to NWCS in the past 10 years or so, and have had a positive experience 
each time, including the one where they told me that there wasn't 
anything they could do to fix the problem (I fried a chip that was no 
longer available).

Note that if you go looking for them with Google, you will first come 
upon an outfit of the same name up in the Seattle area. Here's the 
information for "our" NWCS:

  I think you need to install the perl-modules package

The Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister
A scripting language with delusions of full language-hood, Perl is used
in many system scripts and utilities.

This is a stripped down Perl with only essential libraries.  To make
full use of Perl, you'll want to install the `perl', `perl-modules' and
optionally `perl-doc' packages which supplement this one.

My friend keeps getting a screen that says out of range.

Before, she had my very dark Viewsonic E790.  Her new monitor
is a Viewsonic flat panel.

I tried having her delete all the resolutions in xorg.conf in
subsection display that are greater than 1280x1024.  That hasn't
worked.  She tried system-config-display from the console, 
it won't work.  She is on an SG72 Abit board with a 2.4 Ghz 
Celeron D using the built in video card.  Maybe the mode code
under the DRI section is the problem.

Subject: [PLUG] email over the Internet...
Message-ID: <1160195666.45272e5267924@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Working with a seller on ebay, he said I bounced 2 of his emails to me.

I greylist, what else can I do to avoid having to content filter the 
junk any random zombie on the Net tries to throw at me?

According to postconf mail_version:
mail_version = 2.1.1



I use postfix on a mail relay, my main.cf follows with comments embedded:

queue_directory = /var/spool/relay_spool
command_directory = /usr/sbin
daemon_directory = /usr/libexec/postfix

mail_owner = postfix

default_privs = nobody

canonical_maps=hash:/etc/postfix/canonical

mydomain=robinson-west.com

myorigin=$mydomain

inet_interfaces = 209.210.202.170, 127.0.0.1

mydestination=
local_recipient_maps=
local_transport= error:local delivery is disabled

virtual_alias_maps=hash:/etc/postfix/virtual

mynetworks=127.0.0.0/8, 209.210.202.168/29
relay_domains = $mydomain, goose.$mydomain
parent_domain_matches_subdomains =
    debug_peer_list smtpd_access_maps

relay_recipient_maps=hash:/etc/postfix/relay_recipients
transport_maps=hash:/etc/postfix/transport

in_flow_delay = 1s

smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name

# What should smtpd_banner be and why does postfix allow flexibility here?
# What is in_flow_delay for and what should it be set to?



smtpd_delay_reject = yes

smtpd_helo_required=yes

disable_vrfy_command=yes

smtpd_reject_unlisted_sender=yes

# I don't understand smtpd_delay_reject, help.

# Why does postfix need smtpd_helo_required?  Isn't this standard behavior for
# the (e)smtp protocol?  What does smtp_helo_required do and will the helo 
# address ever be used in a standard way?

# I don't understand what verify is about at all.

# I am assuming the smtpd_reject_unlisted_sender is for the greylisting, spf,
# and blacklisting rules that follow as a sort of default policy.



smtpd_helo_restrictions= check_helo_access hash:/etc/postfix/access,
                         check_helo_access hash:/etc/postfix/invalid_helo,
                         reject_invalid_hostname,
                         reject_non_fqdn_hostname,
                         reject_unknown_hostname,
                         permit_mynetworks

# Again, is any standard followed on the Internet for the helo address?  The 
# above rules are recommended in a lot of postfix documentation, but these 
# rules appear to be for a standard that isn't adhered to.  The invalid_helo 
# file is just a way to prevent mail coming in on my server that claims to be 
# from the server itself.  Is a requirement that a fully qualified domain 
# name match the helo string not adhered to?  How about the unknown hostname
# and invalid hostname rules, are they RFC and standard practices compatible?

Subject: [PLUG] abuse not supported anymore...
Message-ID: <1160201396.452744b44c0d9@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Both ebay.com and earthlink.net don't support an abuse email address.

Don't the RFCs make it clear that this address has to be supported?

Who else is disregarding the RFC standards concerning email?

Is the requirement to support an abuse email address deprecated now?

Failing to support the standard abuse address creates a real headache 
for anyone trying to route an email abuse claim via email to the 
appropriate people in an organization.

Support of webmaster, noc, and ... are these addresses going by the 
wayside as well?

Why is a blacklist for rfc ignorant people who don't support abuse
still in existence if that requirement is deprecated?

Subject: [PLUG] VMWARE WORKSTATION won't configure.
Message-ID: <1160369871.4529d6cfdaa7f@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

This is an excerpt out of vmware-config.pl that isn't working right...

  #
  # Check that the running kernel matches the set of header files
  #

  if (not (-r $answer . '/linux/version.h')) {
    if ($source eq 'user') {
      print wrap('The path "' . $answer . '" is a kernel header file '
                 . 'directory, but it does not contain the file '
                 . '"linux/version.h" as expected.  This can happen if the '
                 . 'kernel has never been built, or if you have invoked the '
                 . '"make mrproper" command in your kernel directory.  In any '
                 . 'case, you may want to rebuild your kernel.' . "\n\n", 0);
    }
    return '';
  }
  $header_version_uts = direct_command(
    shell_string($gHelper{'echo'}) . ' '
    . shell_string('#include <linux/version.h>' . "\n" . $pattern
                   . ' UTS_RELEASE') . ' | ' . shell_string($gHelper{'gcc'})
    . ' ' . shell_string('-I' . $answer) . ' -E - | '
    . shell_string($gHelper{'grep'}) . ' ' . shell_string($pattern));
  chomp($header_version_uts);
  $header_version_uts =~ s/^$pattern \"([^\"]*)\".*$/$1/;
  if (not ($header_version_uts eq $gSystem{'uts_release'})) {
    if ($source eq 'user') {
      print wrap('The directory of kernel headers (version '
                 . $header_version_uts . ') does not match your running '
                 . 'kernel (version ' . $gSystem{'uts_release'} . ').  Even '
                 . 'if the module were to compile successfully, it would not '
                 . 'load into the running kernel.' . "\n\n", 0);

     print "$header_version_uts\n";
     print "$gSystem{'uts_release'}\n";
    }
    return '';
  }

It says my kernel headers don't match my running kernel, but they do.
I'm trying to figure out how this code is getting the wrong answer but
it is too cryptic for me and naturally under commented.  

I tried commenting out the last if statement in the above code and I added 
the last two print statements, compilation failed.

I'm trying to vmware Workstation 5.5 on a Fedora Core 5 system where I'm
beginning to think that this just doesn't work.

Here is the standard error:

What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your running
kernel? [/usr/src/linux/include]

The directory of kernel headers (version @@VMWARE@@ UTS_RELEASE) does not match
your running kernel (version 2.6.18).  Even if the module were to compile
successfully, it would not load into the running kernel.

@@VMWARE@@ UTS_RELEASE
2.6.18

This 2.6.18 kernel is my own vanilla kernel.




Here is what happens when I comment out the offending function:

That seems like it will answer all your questions. (google for "email
abuse rfc" to find more links that may fill gaps in the above
information.)

Ebay wants you to report any phishing/scam attempts to spoof at ebay.com
Earthlink has their own spamblocker tool and will allow their users to
make reports
but if you get something that is from somewhere other than earthlink they
want you to report it back to the originating ISP based on the mail headers.

One of my biggest complaints with most mail readers is how hard it is to 
forward mail in a way that preserves headers.  And it is not just 
Windows...  Linux has the same problem in most cases.

  In pine:
    1. Press 'h' to show all headers
    2. Press 'f' to forward messages
    3. Press 'y' if you want to forward message as attachment
    4. Address message and send

One of the reasons I still use Pine.

Now if the UW people would just fix the ^%&%* license agreement...

It's not that hard.  If you "forward as attachment" it preserves all 
headers in Thunderbird on both linux and windows.  I believe the same is 
true of "forward as attachment" in Evolution.

  In mutt:
    0. add "set mime_forword" to .muttrc
    1. press 'f' to forward messages
    2. address message and send

  If you set mime_forward to either ask-yes or ask-no, it will ask you
  (a la the pine example above) whether to forward as a mime attachment,
  the -yes or -no is the default answer.

Hello,
   Occasionally, like today, I have to grep/slice/dice/munge ~30K files 
and bash it seems can't deal with that many files, here's an example:

   $ zcat * | grep "foo"
   bash: /bin/zcat: Argument list too long

Yes, it seems that I could finally figure out how to use xargs or 
something but I'd rather that bash just worked.  Is there a way to make 
that happen?

thanks,

In this particular case, have you tried using zgrep?

Redistributing, not reselling, is the problem. Binary packagers (Red 
Hat, Debian, and a gazillion other FOSS packagers, big and small 
alike) can't distribute patched binaries.

Want to fix a security flaw that hasn't been fixed in the official UW 
tarball and distribute patched binaries? You're in violation of the UW 
license.

Want to add a cool patch that adds NextGreatWidget to your nifty pine 
binary package? Same story.

So you either have to distribute a completely vanilla binary *or* 
distribute the source code, your custom patchset, and a script that 
patches, compiles, and installs it.

Of course, that means that anyone who wants to use your source 
distribution has to have a machine with all the development headers 
and libraries needed to build a full-function pine: ncurses, OpenLDAP, 
OpenSSL, &c.

See:
http://www.asty.org/articles/20010702pine.html

I think the upshot is, either you try to use free (gpl'ed, bsd'ed, etc.) 
software, or you don't.  Pine's license is non-free.  That matters to 
some people, doesn't matter to others.

Forward as an attachment, then all the headers get preserved automatically.

I'm unsure why you would consider it an 'issue'. Arguments passed to a program are 
stored in the kernel so limiting them to some sane number sounds reasonable, if only to 
reduce the chance of something trying to pass 10 million arguments of 65k, quickly 
consuming more than half a gig of memory.

there are plenty of ways around this limit too, even much more efficient in doing large 
numbers of arguments:

blunt bash-only compatible code below:

while read FOO; do
	something $FOO
done < <(ls)


or just use `find . -type f -exec grep "bar" {} \;`

Cheers,

Auke

I consider it an issue because I have to type different commands to 
process different numbers of the same kind of file, it really seems like 
something that the shell or kernel should accommodate without bothering 
me with it in this day and age.  And in this day and age half a gig of 
memory to process 10 million arguments seems pretty sane to me.

Yes, it is a kernel issue.  And, not just your command-line, but also 
your environment variables.

From the kernel source:
  $ grep ARG_MAX include/linux/limits.h
  #define ARG_MAX   131072	/* # bytes of args + environ for exec() */

If you're regularly dealing with 30k files, you should consider doing 
something like readdir() in Perl.

If you insist on recompiling your kernel, I would like to see some 
benchmarks, because I believe this memory is statically allocated for 
each new process :-D  If that's the case, it is not so much a 
memory-conservation issue as a speed optimization.  I, for one, would 
rather be able to start many small commands quickly than a few large 
ones slowly.

if the shell (foreach ...) complains as well,

use find with -exec argument, or xargs

another is to see if you can break the list into
chunks with shell regex's. something like
doit a*;doit b*; etc.

PS Don't know how well ext3 handles lots of files
in one directory, but the old days it was not a
good idea to go over oh .. like a 1000 files per.

of course, but can you please tell me how long you have been using linux fine without 
hitting this restriction?

The argument that everything should be possible obviously does not accomodate any sense 
of security at all. Do you open 2000000 files simultaneously often? Keep 2TB large log 
files? use more than 32 processors? How about running 65k processes at the same time 
sleeping?

At one point the Operating System has to decide that resources (which are limited on any 
system) and that anyone trying to use all of them might be doing bad things. Setting 
limits to resources is always a smart thing, even when they seem ridiculously low or 
restrictive - most people will benefit from them.

Your computer can often do much more than your OS allows, but that may often not be the 
smartest thing, if you want to actually get some work done ;)

Cheers,

Auke

You would think this could be set from ulimit.  That would be too easy.

ulimit does handle a few things that you used to have to recompile for, 
such as filehandles.  If it handles arg_max they have not updated the man 
pages to cover it.

It is larger now, but still starts to slow down A LOT after about 100,000 
files.

This is why you don't use mh to read the kernel list. ]:>

Yeah, in the bad old days having so many files in a directory would be 
painfully slow, today it doesn't seem to be any problem.

I believe this is why the '-O dir_index' option now exists in 
mkfs.ext3/mke2fs and tune2fs:
"Use  hashed  b-trees  to  speed  up lookups in large directories."

I'm not sure if this is implemented implicitly with ext3 or if it has to 
be specified explicitly.  Anyone know the answer to this?

It can be, it is not as easy a limit to hit.

I remember someone who wrote a web cgi script that dumped one entry into a 
directory for every hit on the script.  It had a HUGE number of entries. 
Trying to even "ls" the directory would bring the system to its knees.  I 
had to use a number of tricks to drain the file swamp.

I never did find out how many files were there.  I know it was at least 
250,000.  Maybe more.

mh and nmh are mail readers that keep every message as a seperate file. 
It used to be painful to use when you have a huge number of messages in 
one folder.

It's not the default, but I know that Red Hat's installation utility 
(also used in related distros like Fedora Core and CentOS) adds it 
when creating filesystems at install time.

I am pretty sure you have to set this by hand.  It is not backwards 
compatible to older kernels and it requires running "e2fsck -D" on the 
partition afterwards.  Not something you do on a whim.

Yep. You are right.  tune2fs -l will list the options on the partition. 
"dir_index" will list if the option has been set.

Yes, it forces one-column mode, but it would have been 1 column
mode anyway. No need to type -1.

Anyone who claims to know scripting and didn't recall these two solutions
needs to go back to Scripting 101 class for a refresher on basic
commands.  :-)  I suppose all too often this is done inside a shell
nowadays, but this is an old and very effective solution.

Yup, know this one. Knew the solution that has already been mentioned
too. Back with Debian and a 2.2 kernel, /var/lib/dpkg/info was pretty
painful. Given that 2.2 is pretty rare now, in most cases setting
dir_index is a good idea.

Now there is no need but I have run into this on other systems. 
Thinking hard I believe it was AIX.  Old habits die hard, plus if Brent 
is having issues with the argument list being too long other stuff could 
be different.

36,000+ files in a directory?  Time to think on the concept of a more 
robust directory structure.

Since I don't see any performance problems with putting them in one 
directory I don't see any reason why not to.

And I still have to fold, spindle, and/or mutilate all 36000 files with 
a command, whether I dump them into a deep directory tree or in one flat 
directory it doesn't much matter to me since I'll get the same "argument 
list too long error" using the same methods that work for smaller number 
of files.

  I think you need to install the perl-modules package

The Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister
A scripting language with delusions of full language-hood, Perl is used
in many system scripts and utilities.

This is a stripped down Perl with only essential libraries.  To make
full use of Perl, you'll want to install the `perl', `perl-modules' and
optionally `perl-doc' packages which supplement this one.

"Supported" also means that there is someone to sue if something goes

This is repeated so often I'm starting to think it's a myth. Has anyone ever 
actually sued a tech vendor? You'd think Microsoft would be the leader in 
lawsuits from unhappy customers.

the last time I looked in a disctionary the words 'supports' and 'is liable' were 
different. Now I know that some people tend to disagree, but I'm pretty sure that 
Microsoft's laywers will never ever let those two words cover the same legal meaning 
without a fight to the bitter end ;)

*Starting* to think it's a myth?  "Who do I sue if something goes
wrong?" is one of the classic anti-OSS arguments.  The only reasonable
answer is, "the same people as you would with propriety junk."

No idea why product-liability law applies to everything but software,

It is the excuse used by management.  It does not mean it is true.  They 
like the idea of being able to hold someone "accountable", even if it is a 
delusional fantasy.

>From a programmer perspective, having source code is a much better 
assurance than to have someone I can point at and blame.

"Support" means I have someone who can answer questions if I get stuck and 
provide patches if it breaks.  I have both with Open Source.  In fact, I 
get MUCH better answers from the Open Source community than I have ever 
gotten from a proprietary vendor.

An example:

Back in the Windows 3.1 days, I was working on a DOS program written in C 
and real mode x86 assembly.  I was trying to port the code to the current 
Microsoft compiler toolchain.  I found a set of assembly language macros 
with a Microsoft copyright in them.  I called Microsoft support with what 
I thought was a simple question.  "Where was this macro documented and 
where did it come from?"

No one at Microsoft support could tell me.

I found it later on.  The macros were from a Windows SDK.  They were fully 
documented, but their "support" had no knowlege of their existence.

In my experience, support from proprietary companies is next to worthless.

On the other hand, Open Source allows me to know who wrote a program and 
who to talk to if it breaks or I find a bug.  I can talk to the 
programmer, not just some Stream employee with a standard sub-standard 
level of training on the product.  Not only that, I can get it fixed. 
When was the last time you could say that about a Microsoft product?

It is much more practical to use Open Source for critical applications. 
Anyone who says otherwise is trying to sell you something.

I used one some time back (no idea what brand, it was big,
silver-colored, and somewhat difficult to open), and more recently
used a simple usb drive adapter (sans cage) and it Just Worked.  They
are generally pretty simple devices, and should all conform to the usb
storage requirements (whatever those are).

Obviously, try it before you leave the country, but they should just
work.  That said, it sounds like you'll want one that's relatively
easy to get in/out of, and one that supports usb2.

I wish "just work" was true in my experience, but unfortunately it's 
not.  One of my friends in Australia had a generic external hard disk 
enclosure that was USB 2.0 compatible; they bought it in Britain.  The 
enclosure worked fine on my computer but refused to work on his or 
another laptop.  The problem?  It would get recognized and work okay at 
first but after a little while it would just give itself up and die.  It 
would only do this on VIA chipsets.  The enclosure worked fine on every 
computer I tried (about 10), but anything VIA just died.  It didn't 
matter whether it was Linux or Windows.  It's probably not much of a 
problem anymore with the enclosure market mature, but I would warn to do 
some fairly robust tests (reading and/or writing a whole disk) just to 
be sure.

was pushing the limits of the machine.

Now that I have SuSE 10.1 running on a 1.7 GHz machine with 1 GB of 
memory, I expected that problem to go away. It hasn't. I'll try to 
figure out with whom to file the bug report, but in the meantime, can 
anyone recommend some good reading material on how to construct which 
command to achieve the same results? I realize that's a big question, 
which is why I'm asking what manual to read instead of what command to 
type. :-)

Alternatively, or in addition, does anyone have a recommendation for a 
GUI tool for burning CDs? I need to burn both data and audio CDs.

And while on the subject of audio CDs, my recollection is that 700MB 
CD-Rs work for audio. Do I remember correctly, or am I mistaken?

Thanks.

Dick,

   I've used only xcdroast for years. Or, I'll use the mkisofs and cdrecord
tools which the xcdroast uses under the hood.

I have not had problems with k3b.

I have had problems with having a marginal burner.  Replacing the drive 
fixed the problem.

Yes, they work fine.  Some older players might have problems with those, 
but only if you have data out past the 650meg mark.  (Pre-1995 cd 
players.)

cdrecord is the command-line utility that most, if not all, GUI
frontends use to do the dirty work of burning a CD.  You can use
cdrecord from a shell very easily yourself.  To burn an .iso directly to
a disk:

cdrecord -v -eject dev=<cd-device> speed=<something-reasonable> -tao <filename.iso>

dev used to be a SCSI bus identifier (like "1,0,0").  with a 2.6 kernel,
it's far more likely to be an IDE-looking device (like "/dev/hdc").  Do
an "eject /dev/hdc").  If it ejects the CD tray, it'll probably work in
the cdrecord command.

For duping audio CDs, you need to use a combo of cdda2wav and cdrecord.
Here is a sample script:



#!/bin/bash

rip()
{
     rm -f *
     cdda2wav dev=/dev/cdrom -vall cddb=1 -B -Owav
}

wait()
{
     eject /dev/cdrom
     echo Place the blank CD in the drive and wait 30 seconds.
     echo
     sleep 25
     echo 5 seconds left...
     echo
     sleep 5
}

burn()
{
     cdrecord -eject -v dev=/dev/cdrom speed=16 -useinfo -text *.wav
}

cd /var/tmp/xcdroast

case "$1" in
     "rip")
         rip
         ;;
     "burn")
         burn
         ;;
     "all")
         rip
         wait
         burn
         ;;
esac

echo "Done!"
exit 0

That's rather funny - effectively it should do the same, except that xargs doesn't call 
the shell to pass the arguments. Apparently on that platform `ksh` is limiting the 
amount of arguments more than the platform itself, and I would definately consider that 
a ksh bug :)

It also exposes that ksh uses /usr/bin/find internally in a rather stupid way :)

Anyway, if you're really doing something like above, you should have used:

grep -r "ABC" .

which doesn't care how many files there are :)


Cheers,

Auke

I've just installed xcdroast 0.98alpha15. It started up fine, took a 
while looking for devices, made some ratcheting noises on at least one 
of them, and then provided this list:

Starting to scan for devices...
[ATA:1,0,0] SAMSUNG  CD-R/RW SW-252S  R951
[ATA:1,1,0] SAMSUNG  DVD-ROM SD-604   1.0
[ATAPI:0,0,0] SAMSUNG  CD-R/RW SW-252S  R951
[ATAPI:0,1,0] SAMSUNG  DVD-ROM SD-604   1.0
Scan finished.

I guess that means that it found what it needed. I'll have to read up on 
the difference between ATA and ATAPI.

Meanwhile, I'll see if I can find an LP I need on a CD to test it.

Thanks. That's the answer I was looking for. I'll go read up on cdrecord.

SuSE 10.1 (and 9.x, too) use the 2.6 kernel, so my burner is at /dev/hdc.

Thanks, but I won't be duping CDs, I'll be recording LPs with gramofile

Larry,

   I looked closely at SugarCRM. I even installed mysql to run it. I didn't
like it because its focus is not on my needs.

Mine did.  And it would work with some medias and speeds and not others 
until it would not burn correctly at all.

New 16x DVD burners are $37 at Pacific Solutions.

Flakey drives are not worth the time.

   In case others are interested, the ZohoCRM looks like it will work for me.
It comes with postgres-8.0.3 (and I'll see how to have it use the
already-installed 8.1.4), and is bundled with tomcat so I don't have to futz
with that. The native PostgreSQL support is a welcome find.

   They have a free edition that supports up to three users. Interestingly
enough, root cannot install it, only a user can. (The instructions for a
winduhs installation require administrator priviledges on that platform.)

The only recommendation would be to make sure that you can provide external
power.  Most USB2 connections can provide enough power but if you happen
to plug it into a port that uses too small of a cable to allow current
to flow without
a significant voltage drop, the drive will not function and the whole
setup will be
worthless.

Isn't cdrecord on its way out?  Debian has already replaced it (in fact, 
my update this morning to Etch removed the cdrecord package), and from 
what I understand, SuSE, Red Hat and others will follow suit.  Most 
distros have already been patching cdrecord heavily because of 
incompatibilities with upstream and the 2.6 series kernel.  Now I think 
they are giving up on it altogether.

Assuming, of course, you're on a platform where grep has a recursive
option.  (AIX 4.3.3 and Solaris 8 don't, for example.  Yes, I'm still
suck with an AIX 4.3.3 box around.)

"Forward" is sufficient in Evolution.  It's also sensible enough to
display the headers of embedded messages like the containing message's
headers, and toggle them with "All Message Headers".  Now if only they'd
fix some of the other broken shit, like the utter insanity required to
add or change keyboard accelerators, kinda lousy IMAP support,
half-assed WebDAV, etc.

Message-ID: <1160439999.452ae8bf1cccf@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Fedora Core 3 and Redhat 7.x seem to be largely incompatible...

I try to mount from Redhat 7.3 box an nfs partition exported on
a Fedora Core 3 box and end up getting a mount version error.

Slackware 10.1's perl isn't compatible with Redhat 7.3's...

I try to run an EasyTCP socket program between SW10.1 and RH7.3
box only to get a perl-Storable version mismatch error.

Centos 4.3 to Fedora Core 3 also gives me NFS trouble.  
CentOS 4.3 as the client produces a mount version error.
So much for netbooting Redhat 7.x boxes into CentOS to
back them up to a FC3 NFS share.  I thought FC3 and 
Centos 4.3 Final were essentially supposed to be the 
same distribution.

For people who run mixed enterprise and bleeding edge
Linux distros, don't they need to talk to each other?
Is there any simple way to ensure compatibly between
FC3 and other Redhat variants new and old?

What if I have an old system running Redhat 6.2 and I 
want it to be able to mount shares off of a FC3 box?

Which RFCs deal with HELO addresses and what they have to be?

Will IPv6 improve the dns infrastructure across the Internet at all?

Are these failed connection attempts most likely zombied Windows boxes?
What are the most accurate ways to detect zombie hosts without breaking

As I understand it, using the pipe turns the list of command line args
into a fifo pipe from ls to xargs -- the pipe can then be any size (as
long as it can hold one file name).  xargs is then responsible for
managing storage of the entries, and (probably) processes them as they
come in.  It does the same thing, but in a very different way -- it
allows lazy evaluation of the arg list, in effect.

One should note that the above command will fail without passing "-0"
to xargs -- it will break on files / directories with spaces
otherwise.

ls | xargs -0 grep "ABC"

I'm sure X-CD-Roast is a wonderful program. Considering the strong
recommendation above, I installed it. Fifteen minutes later I
uninstalled it.

Why? Well, for starters, it insisted that I launch it first as root to
configure it. I did so, and there was a button to start it so that any
user could launch it. I did so. Then there was a button to go ahead and
launch it. I clicked on it and it launched it, but insisted that there
was no configuration file. After a while I found the config settings
and told it to save them. Then I exited and restarted, whereupon it
repeated that there was no config file. After three attempts I finally
got it to launch without that error message.

Then I put a CD in the drive and told it to duplicate it, whereupon it
told me that it could not find any CD drives. I told it to rescan and
it still couldn't find the CD drive. Finally I added it manually. It
took a lot more fiddling around, but eventually I came to the
conclusion that it is not able to see my CD-DVD R+W drive. Oddly, when
I told it manually that the device was /dev/hdc it found the stuff
identifying the manufacturer and model number (or what looked like a
manufacturer and model number). I can put a CD in the drive, the drive
whirs, Nautilus pops up a window, but X-CD-Roast says the drive is
empty. It shows an icon for the drive and everything, it just can't
read it. Also the Eject button doesn't work, more evidence that there
is a fundamental problem.

So, back to K3b and Gnomebaker. They read/write to the drive just fine.
Time to leave well enough alone. :)

RH7.3 is "ancient", seriously consider upgrading.  If you can't,
prepare to build a new kernel and replace some core binaries so it is
at least _somewhat_ bugfixed, secure, and interoperable.

Warnings on doing an NFS mount between versions is "normal", as long
as the mount still takes place you're OK.  RPC/mountd/lockd/statd
versions change, versions of nfsutils/mount change, etc and generate
warnings.

I wouldn't say you're running bleeding edge there... RH6/7 and FC3 are
pretty much outdated.  At the very least, they're full of known issues
that have been fixed in recent distros/kernels/packages, since they
haven't had updates for a while.

Get some packet captures and strace output of the client when you
attempt these mounts, it should shed significant light on what's going
on.

Cheers,

/eli

RH7.3 has been maintained (including security fixes) by the Fedora 
Legacy Project (fedoralegacy.org) all the way through October 1st of 
this year.  Security fixes may even continue to be done until December 
31st; I'm not sure about this due to the working on the project page. 
It's not riddled with security holes yet...but probably will be soon. 
It's definitely time to consider executing that upgrade path.

RFC2821 says it has to be an IP address in square brackets or a FQDN.

As a side note, given an non-updated fedora core 4 system, how do I

`wodim` from "cdrkit", http://www.cdrkit.org/  Looks to simply be a fork
of `cdrecord` due to those maintainence difficulties. Bit of a pity
there, I've found I like FreeBSD's `burncd` utility to have a slightly
nicer command line.

Of course if you're adventuresome you can try the kernel's UDF
write/packet writing capability. Seems to work pretty well with RW media.

Subject: [PLUG] Seeking a Metrix Mark II / Pyramid Linux guru
Message-ID: <334c4450610111905u3c4890ch577239f9fddc5d6c@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I stumbled across your list while doing some research and have seen some
posts referencing Pyramid Linux and
from the majority of the posts, it looks like I've come across a fairly
Linux savy crowd.

I'm performing a research project in Omaha, Nebraska (a little far from
Portland I know).

I'm not a Linux Networking guru, but know just enough to be dangerous (or
break things).

Problem #1:

To begin, there is little documentation on Pyramid or the Metrix Mark II
kits.  However, I've got them built and running
and am able to login (yada yada).

I can't seem to get eth0 on these guys to obtain an IP address on my network
via DHCP.

Via the WebAdmin, I've disabled the DHCP server and enabled DHCP client.

Afterwards, the entry in /etc/network/interfaces looks like this:

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

Nothing too complicated.

After issuing ifup on eth0, I see:

#ifup eth0
udhcpc (v0.9.9-pre) started
Sending discover...
Sending discover...
Sending discover...
No lease, failing.
Failed to bring up eth0.

I know my cables and networking gear are OK as my Windoze boxen can obtain a
DHCP address fine.
Furthermore, when configuring eth0 to use a static IP and serve DHCP, all is
well.

Anyone have a clue as to what I'm missing here?


Problem #2:

The goal of my research is to understand the feasiblity of getting a
community based wirless network going
here in Omaha.  So I've got 2 of these Metrix Mark II kits.

One of my desired experiments is to get something like this (multihop
wireless communication) going:

|Laptop 1| <--1--> |Metrix A| <--2--> |Metrix B| <--3--> |Laptop 2|

Link 1 is an 802.11b connection between Laptop 1 and the wlan0 (in AP mode)
interface serving DHCP on Metrix A.
Link 2 is an 802.11a connection between the Metrix boxes running OSLR on
ath0 (in ad-hoc mode) of each box.
Link 3 is an 802.11b connection between Laptop 2 and the wlan0 (in AP mode)
interface serving DHCP on Metrix B.

I've got links 1 and 3 tested with no problems.  Also, I've got link 2 setup
and can see the OSLR visualization map.
What about the routing between wlan0 and ath0 on the Metrix boxen?  What are
some good address schemes to
allow Laptop 1 to address Laptop 2 (and vice versa)?

Later on, I plan on pulling the eth0 interface(s) of the Metrix box(es) into
the picture to allow Internet access.

Any suggestions or direction to example setups would be much appreciated.

Thanks for putting up with my long-winded post, just getting a little
frustrated.

Ben

Have you considered the possibility of it being an issue with the 
firewall not letting DHCP packets through?  I'm not running Pyramid 
Linux, but the following might work to open a hole in the firewall for DHCP:
iptables -A INPUT -p udp --sport 67 --dport 68 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --sport 68 --dport 67 -j ACCEPT

or you could try flusing your entire firewall:
iptables -F
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT

The above might not work...just depends if there is anything 
custom/special about how the distro has set up the firewall.

Daniel,

Thank you for your prompt reply and suggestion.

iptables isn't configured yet (I was looking at configuring that and/or
bridging to solve Problem #2).

In the default install, there are no rules in any of the 3 stock chains and
the default policy for each chain is to ACCEPT.

I went ahead and gave what you suggested a try anyhow, but still no luck.

Thanks again,

Ben

Interesting. I saw the warning about having to do that, but ignored it 
and it worked fine. I installed it using YaST, so someone may have done 
the adjustments ahead of time.

To each whatever works.

This is an example of how parts of the GNU/Linux experience are not 
quite ready for the unwashed masses (not that I'm much more than wet 
behind the ears), but also how the community provides multiple ways to 
solve the same problems.

Pyramid is just a whittled down Ubuntu, with some things thrown on
top, like the web administration interface.  I have quite a bit of
experience with the Metrixes, but not so much with OLSR.

Regarding your DHCP problem, have you considered a wiring problem?  If
you use a static IP can you ping across your network cable?

The sending mail server needs to be able to identify itself using a real DNS name, 
otherwise we cannot return bounces and other problems to it. In the above case, I think 
that they didn't provide a proper name at all (HELO\n) or something useless (HELO 
localhost.localdomain\n).

> I am

An A record resolves a name into an IP. If you look at it that way, the name part is a 
required part in that ;)

> Are these DNS records most likely being put out by verizon 
> or are they complete duds?

Since the host didn't identify it properly postfix resolved the PTR record for that IP 
address, which gave something like pool-72-93-204-6.bstnma.fios.verizon.net. That's 
convenient since now you know that a verizon customer was trying to reach you and you 
can call verizon about abuse, etc.

don't know by heart, sorry :)

> Will IPv6 improve the dns infrastructure across the Internet at all?

unlikely :)

> Are these failed connection attempts most likely zombied Windows boxes?

of course! did you really think you had that many friends? ;)

ah! now that's a really good question.

I'm afraid there's no such thing as 'most acurate' as almost all methods have flaws in 
them. Being a bastard at smtp level by dropping bad HELO names, things like rfc-ignorant 
etc. all help, and some dnsbl lists seem to work ok (no false positives), most of them 
are still not good enough to my taste (spamassassin, bogofilter) to deploy on larger 
systems. SPF? not widely used and paranoia-driven if you ask me.

since kernel.org switched filters I'm getting 3-10 spams a day :/ (they switched to 
bogofilter afaik)

I prefer dropping and blocking people during the smtp session itself when badness occurs 
(I have a custom syslog daemon that drops IPs on certain messages). That does make some 
spam trickle through but prevents my servers being targeted by zombies directly, and 
gets rid of a lot of abuse quickly.

Cheers,

Auke

Subject: [PLUG] Freedos 1.0 EMM386 problem...
Message-ID: <1160625293.452dbc8d29b58@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I have an Intel 440LX Pentium II 300 monorail mobo.  Okay, I'm trying to run
Freedos 1.0 on a Compaq 4.3 gig scsi hard drive connected to an Adaptec 2940U2W
scsi controller.  The emm386.exe driver works fine off of the cd.  When I
try to start freedos booting from my scsi hard disk I get:

     getFATblock failed: 0x00005c68

This is version 2.26 of emm386.  I know emm386 is crashing because commenting
it out results in a successfull boot.  What I find strange is that emm386 
which came with Beta 9 release 1, maybe release 2, doesn't crash on me.

I believe the scsi card is at address e800h according to the scsi utilities.
I see "using PAGEFRAME e000:0000"  I think my scsi controller's code,  what 
is loaded to ram, is being overwritten.  This is just a guess, but it would
explain the getFATblock failed message.  Naturally, this also explains why
I can't load command.com after this error.  What I can't figure out is why
I can boot from cd and start emm386 without losing hard drive access.

I am dissapointed having purchased a cd from Linux Mall that it is a CD-R
first off and second off that the source code to wget is corrupted.
What else is wrong with it?  It's awfully strange for the first stable release
of freedos to be less functional than the last beta.  I really like gem.
FAT32 support isn't finished and it should have been dropped in my opinion.

Is there a dos driver for the adaptec 2940U2W that I need to install?  It
should be on the cd in my opinion, but it seems that my freedos cd wants
Internet access to download drivers and possibly patches.  DOS is supposed 
to be simple and fast, not Internet repository dependant.  Still, what 
freedos can do is pretty impressive.

Or they returned a bogus name used behind a firewall.

I had this problem with my mailserver.  The name "blackbox.fnordora.org" 
did not resolve to anything and caused this sort of rejection.

Bringing this thread back to life. Still trying to figure this one out. I
have ruled out SSH as using Telnet causes the same behavior with the second
CPU enabled. However with both CPU's going and logging in locally the issue
doesn't happen. So its something with sockets/bash or some other weirdness
but I'm at a loss now. Someone at work suggested maybe a glibc problem but
I'm running a recent version that supports NPTL and bash is using those libs
and when I force standard linux thread libs it still has the same problem.

I had some issues with external USB cages and Linux, which could be
similar to the problems Daniel mentions.  It was a while ago, on 2.4
kernels, and may be resolved by now.  See:

     http://www.keithl.com/usb2bug.html

My approach for on-the-road backup for my IBM T30 is to use a hard
drive ultrabay adapter.  I power down the machine, unlatch the CD and
latch in the hard drive adapter. I reboot the machine in single user,
unmount all the partitions but /, and do a:

     sync ; dd bs=1M if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdc

This copies the complete 80GB disk image at about 1GB/minute to an 
identical drive.  Since the second hard drive is easily removable
from the ultrabay adapter, it is easy to swap into the primary slot
if I lose the main drive while on the road.  I keep the spare drive
wrapped up in a ziploc bag in my dirty laundry for padding - I just
have to be careful not to wash it!  The drive plus the adapter is
very light compared to most external USB drives.

I've actually started doing this too -- although not for backups (yet)
just to have more space. I haven't tried it, but thinkwiki claims you
can hot-swap these drives now:

Message-ID: <20061012193800.80167.qmail@web509.biz.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hey I got a problem recognizing NTFS with Knoppix or any other Linux distro for that matter. It sees the drive but does not allow me to make changes, overwrite, or paste to the drive. I can copy from it.

2 reasons I need to use NTFS.

1. I want to work on XP computers from Live CDs.
2. I want to build a Linux Distro that can import or access existing files from Windows to share them (of course it would be nice if Windows could recognise Linux partitions too but lets stop dreaming).

If anyone has any advice on how to do this I would appreciate it.

Outstanding!  Alan Cox put drive swap into the later 2.4.x kernels,
and the 2.6.x folk took it back out.  It is good to see it is in
there again.  I use hotswap on my server, and this means I can 
upgrade my kernel.

For the backups, I am taking things down to single user so the machine
is quiet, so it would not save me much effort for the T30.  But it
would be nice for single file restores!

NTFS write support is usually not allowed by default on most Linux 
distributions because it has the potential of damaging your Windows 
partition.  There is write support

Have a look at the following FAQ entry on Knoppix's website:
http://www.knoppix.net/wiki/Using_FAQ#Q:_How_can_I_write_data_on_NTFS_partitions.3F

The FAQ entry just above it is also useful as it explains how to make 
the partition writable with Knoppix 5.x.

As far as Windows detecting Linux partitions, it depends on the 
filesystem you are using for Linux.  EXT2/3 and ReiserFS can be accessed 
within Windows.  For ReiserFS, have a look at the external links at the 
bottom of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReiserFS .  For EXT2/3, have a 
look at the external links at the bottom of 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext2

Something funny is going on with interrupts, probably.

 o Have you tried a different NIC, preferably not on-board?
 o Have you tried pinging it, preferably more than the default 4 times 
   Windows ping does? You might find some odd variances in ping times 
   where there should be none.
 o If you can do a flood ping or otherwise send other traffic to the 
   host while making the connection and see if that causes it to not 
   happen--it sounds like a buffer somewhere isn't getting flushed as 
   often as expected and pumping data through might cause it to be 
   flushed.
 o Run Wireshark (nee Ethereal) while logging in and compare packet 
   timings, look for broken packets, etc.
 o Check /etc/profile, /etc/profile.d, /etc/bashrc to see if something 
   gets run or set on login.  You might temporarily enable tracing by 
   putting 'set -x' at the top of the /etc/profile and see if you can 
   pinpoint where it stops, if it actually stops.

I read this but I don't understand how to access, use, or turn on libntfs and fuse.
Do I also need to change the mode of read write to NTFS also? I believe I would. hmmm. Oh another thought. Does this work with SATA drives. I don't get the same icons for a HD as the ones shown on the FAQ page for a Hard Drive instead I get a USB device icon. Is this just a bug? I am suing Knopix 5.0 and 4 neither one seem to help me. I don't want the risks involved with 4. 5 sounds safer.


A: Knoppix 5 supports write access for NTFS (http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS) partitions using libntfs and fuse. While preliminary results show generally good stability and a low likelihood of data corruption on the NTFS partition, these libraries are still beta and there is risk of data loss and disk corruption (back up your data first). Knoppix (and the Linux kernel) can read NTFS partitions just fine, the danger is only present when attempting to write to it. 
Older versions of Knoppix can be forced to write to NTFS partitions, but at great risk of scrambling the underlying NTFS filesystem (Captive NTFS (http://www.jankratochvil.net/project/captive/) used the existing NTFS drivers from a Windows system to acesss the NTFS drive, but was slow and unstable.)

We have a mixture of these OSes in our lab:

Redhat	7.2 through RHEL4 latest update
Mandrake/iva 8.0 through 2007
SuSE 8.2 through 10.x
FreeBSD 4.1 through 6.1
Solaris 2.6 through 10 on Sparc
Solaris 10 on x86
AIX 4.2 through 5.3
HP-UX 10.2 through 11.23

All of these above mount nfs partitions between each other, as long as 
you honor the nfs versions that each support. Some of the systems don't 
support nfs version 3 or 4. Some support nfs over tcp/ip, while others 
support udp, and others support both.

> I try to mount from Redhat 7.3 box an nfs partition exported on

I suspect the Redhat box is just asking, and the Fedora box is trying to 
serve a newer version than the Redhat box supports. But that's just a 
guess. Without more information, it's impossible to say.

> Slackware 10.1's perl isn't compatible with Redhat 7.3's...

I'd expect some incompatibilities when writing a perl script on a 10.1 
box, since the perl on slack 10.1 is probably 5.8.x, while on 7.3 it's 
5.004 or something... Lot's of changes in there. New features and stuff.

Again, if perl-Storable has been updated in the last 5 years, then it 
probably has changes that your script doesn't take into account.

You have to write to the lowest common denominator. So if you must run 
the script on both system, write it on the oldest system. That doesn't 
guarantee anything, but I bet you'll have fewer issues to resolve.

Then why would they have two different distros? I use a knoppix CD to 
boot my x86 boxes and dd the drive to a RHEL4 nfs share. It works great.

For laptop backups I use a usb laptop hard drive adapter.  It holds a 2.5"
laptop drive.  It is small enough to carry around.  It is made of aluminum,
so it does not add huge amounts of weight.  It also supports firewire on the
same enclosure. You can get laptop drives of at least 100 gigs these days.
(Just depends how much you want to spend.)

And it has a REAL bright light on it.

I picked up mine at Pacific Solutions for about $35.

The support is variable, but you could also try UDF. Linux can read and
write UDF (but fsck for UDF isn't in all distributions). I'm lead to
believe that W should also be able to do so (due to use on larger USB
keyfobs?).

I'm looking at reasons to migrate from Unix to Linux. So far I've come up 
with:

-cost
-flexibility
-better feature set
-dependency-resolving installers like apt and yum
-runs on lower-cost hardware
-not moldy

*bsd or OpenSolaris are also possibilities. I don't have any Unix experience, 
so I'd appreciate some wisdom from wizened I mean wise old Unix geeks.

Other things that come to mind:
-Open code means more security review
-Open code means more F/OSS applications that use deep-ish system hooks 
are available
-Open code means that if you run into a really nasty bug, you can edit 
the thing yourself (or hire someone to) and have a different, fixed, OS 
for an entire enterprise within hours. Just try that with HP/UX, SCO, 
etc.
-Choice and variation: Just try to find 30+ versions of any closed *nix 
that will cater to your needed languages, equipment style, desktops, 
etc., or allow you to make your own version.

"It's the applications, stupid!" -- More important to most people (end
users particularly), OSS applications are in demand and, with rare
exceptions, there is no better platform for OSS applications than a
Linux distribution.

No, I haven't done a Google on it but will.  I'm just looking for some

Dependency-resolving installers and packaging is *very* valuable.  At
OSDL we had a policy that we could rebuild a production system from
OS install onwards, automatically.  If there was software on the system,
it came from a package that was checked-in to CVS and listed in CFEngine.  
When you can clone or rebuild a prod. system from bare-metal in less
than an hour, it makes problems *much* less stressful.

I'm sure these are mostly explications of "cost", "flexibility" and "not
moldy", but here's mine: 
* Runs on a wide variety of hardware, incl. some old Unix boxes.  
* You can run the exact same OS & software on servers, dev-boxes and
  sandboxes.  There's usually no extra licensing charge, and the devs
  can actually work on usable desktop systems.  
* Runs on commodity (which means "available in standard form from a
  variety of vendors", not "cheap") hardware so you can comparison-shop,
  run competitive bids and buy precisely the hardware you need.
* Open Source means no End-Of-Life, ever, if you're willing to pay.
  Recent versions of popular packages & distros cost less to support, of
  course.
* You can rent generic linux boxes (or even VMs) in hosting centers
  at competitive prices instead of running your own datacenter.
* Linux is now the standard platform for most opensource applications;
  other platforms are less well-supported and often lagging.
* If you make a major conversion, you can throw out your overpriced
  monitoring and management software and substitute OSS stuff.
* Sysadmins and techs are *much* easier to hire.

And as some bearded older guy whose site I can't find anymore said,
Would you rather have proprietary vendors dragging you down, or dragging
down your competitor?

As a wizened old Unix user (1975-1999), my main reasons for switching
to Linux were:

1) Rapidly developing and adaptive ( "not moldy?")

2) Books and online information and community.  Far more information on
   how most things actually work.

3) Open source.  Sometimes the code needs tweaking.  Sometimes you have
   to look at the source to see why things do what they do.

4) Control.  I am master of my own systems and software.  I choose upgrades
   and fixes on my own schedule and for my own needs.

5) Opportunities to give back to the community.  Open source users help
   each other, and helping others builds character.

These features were not available for Solaris, closed BSDs, and SVR4
variants when I was using them.  The deciding moment for me was when
I was unable to patch or replace some of the applications that were
Y2K noncompliant on a proprietary *nix.  So here I am...

Just don't rely on UDF for anything other than short-term 
storage/transfer.  The beginning of the end of my trust in proprietary 
software solutions was when I discovered I'd been hoodwinked by 
Adaptec/Roxio's fantabulous marketing claims for packet-writing to 
CD/RW.  "Use your CD-ROM drive just like a floppy drive and get 500X the 
storage capacity!"  Yeah ... how about, "Lose 500X the amount of data 
you can with a floppy!"

But then, I've never claimed that I've never been naive.

System Programmer in an IBM mainframe shop.

  The biggest difference I see with OSS is that you are free from
vendor lock-in.  You don't have some sales vampire with their hand in
your back pocket.  I could carry on all night with horror stories from
my encounters with SUN, HP, and IBM sales staff.  It's been a decade,
but I *still* carry a cold place in my heart for HP-UX because of my
last encounters with their sales staff.

  To paraphrase a comment made by a Wall Street CIO.  He didn't give
damn what OS his server farm was running.  He switched from Solaris to
Linux because when he put out an RFP for server chassis, he had Dell,
Compaq, and IBM tripping over each other to give him the best quote.

Doesn't the linux kernel support packet writing?  I've never used it
(for reasons like those mentioned already), but I see the option in the
kernel config.  Perhaps someone out there can actually explain how to
make use of it.

I'm stuck ... I'm not even sure where to look any more, but I'm sure what I want to do is simple and has to be described somewhere.

I want to send mail from within a php script. I'm running Ubuntu Dapper with Apache and PHP5.  I have a PHP example, which does echo the right stuff to the screen but the mail never gets set. My mailer is evolution (whcih on its own picks up mail just fine). I don't know how to invoke it from within php.

The script invokes mail in its last line (which apparently, I don't have?) I've tried various other versions of this line, including trying to invoke evolution but with no success.

I know this is a simple problem, but I've put in a bunch of time and I'm clearly not looking in the right place....

that requires a form of sendmail on your machine, be it postfix or any of the other smtp

1. Yeah, K3B is a finicky beast. The current version I have (0.12.17)
doesn't like to run as other than "root". Previous versions have
exhibited other nonsensical behavior, and as someone in this thread
noted, there isn't really a "responsible programmer" one can go to for
fixes. You pretty much have to do your own debugging, etc.

2. xcdroast isn't really actively maintained, and you have to do some
finagling to, say, download an ISO with BitTorrent and burn it straight
to a CD or DVD, and operation which is a simple button push in K3B.

3. I have not found any other GUI tool I could even make work. Nor have
I bothered to investigate command line tools. I simply live with the
gotchas in K3B and xcdroast.

4. This whole DVD/CD/intellectual property vs. free software business
isn't something I have the energy to deal with. If I have something that
works that I paid for, like a laptop that plays DVDs using Windows XP
Home, I use it and I'm happy. When someone comes along like Sony did and
messes with that, I'm unhappy.

Subject: [PLUG] Spotty DNS Resolution
Message-ID: <45316844.6000507@digitree.org>

I am trying to track down the cause of some spotty DNS service, which 
has recently started causing me to lose emails from some people.

My DNS server seems to work fine in itself.  I'm using BIND 9.3.2.  I 
can use nslookup to query every single hostname in my zone file when I 
point the queries at my nameserver.  I can do this locally on the box 
that has BIND, from any other machine on my local network and from 
computers on the "outside".  I haven't tested enough from the outside 
yet to know for certain.  My DNS configuration seems fine and it is the 
same configuration files I used to use a year ago without any problems 
and the service responds as I would expect.

The problem then is that some DNS servers on the Internet get the 
correct DNS information from my server while others don't.  Sometimes 
the DNS server will get some of my DNS records but not all of them.  I 
have not updated my DNS records in a couple of months so it's not an 
issue with propagation time.

I'm using Dotster as my registrar and they require that I provide two 
fully qualified hostnames for my DNS.  I only have one DNS server so I 
provide the registrar with a hostname that doesn't have a DNS server on 
it, using another static IP address I own, but not on the same network.

I'm using DSL-Only as my ISP with a static IP address.  I have a Linksys 
WRT54G router that is set to forward all DNS requests to my nameserver; 
I am not using OpenWRT on this box, but  rather just the standard software.

To do some testing, I contacted two of DSL-Only's DNS servers, 
sulfur.dsl-only.net (63.105.16.4) and silver.dsl-only.net (63.105.16.2). 
  sulfur is able to correctly provide me with information for all of my 
DNS entries.  silver, on the other hand, can only provide me with 4 of 
about 13 records and returns failure on the other 9, including failure 
for my MX record.

Throughout my period of DNS woes, I have been receiving email from all 
of my mailing lists without any major hiccups.  I have been able to 
communicate with many companies in a timely fashion who have their own 
mail servers and have not noticed any missed communications (no 4 hour 
delays, etc).  Rich Shepard and one other individual written to me about 
problems DNS resolution problems from their end using public nameservers 
(Rich, care to elaborate?).  Google's Gmail used to work but now doesn't 
work for sending email to my address.  I'm still waiting for Gmail to 
report back an error message.  I haven't tested Yahoo or Hotmail.

My DNS server is authoritative and is the first entry in my list of DNS 
servers with my registrar.  It's not something silly like using a 
possibly unresolvable hostname, as I have entered a hostname that is not 
managed by my DNS server itself (ie. subxx-xxx.member.dsl-only.net.

I'm wondering if my Linksys router is to blame.  I might put OpenWRT on 
it in the middle of the night tonight if nobody else can offer up any 
suggestions (I have my configuration settings all ready to go from 
another Linksys box I had).

Any thoughts on where to start?

Cheers,

This is likely your problem. Most DNS servers these days, it seems, give up 
after about 2000ms if they can't get the info you want. Especially when just 
doing forwards. The DNS scheme is that you have multiple servers so if one is 
down/unreachable you can keep trying all the servers for a zone. Since most 
software doesn't seem to do that anymore, your listing a non-DNS server as a 
server for your domain is likely the cause of the problem. Resolvers are 
probably trying that one first, and giving up.

In cases where I've had no other options, I've run a second IP on one host and 
listed both IPs as the two nameservers for a domain. No redundancy, but at 
least all DNS requests are satisfied if the host is up (and any services on 
that host would be down if the host were down, anyway, negating any benefit 
to redundancy)

If all else fails, you could use everydns.net for a secondary server. I've 
used them for a while now without any problems. (Free/donation requested 
service)

Timeouts could be a very likely issue and may be my main problem.  There 
is always a possibility on the server that the DNS response might lag by 
a couple of seconds.  This is because I don't have very much memory on 
the machine and some other services on the box might cause BIND to swap 
out of memory at the wrong time.  Good suggestion; not much I can do 
about it besides get more memory or move it to another box (ie. OpenWRT 
router or something).

This is what I used to do several years ago.  Getting a second IP 
address in the short term is a no go as I'm getting ready to move in a 
couple of days (servers will stay "for now"), but may be viable in a 
month or so.  When I moved overseas I was able to update Dotster's DNS 
server list to only have a single entry so I only had one IP address 
there which worked well.  When I moved back to Portland and set up a 
server here, Dotster had updated their inteface to require a minimum of 
two servers (very annoying).

I tried a similar service to everydns.net once a couple years ago; I 
can't remember the name of it but I don't think it was everydns.  I 
wound up losing my DNS records for almost a week it suddenly stopped 
serving my domain.  I will consider trying everydns, thanks.

Instead of trying to put your IP address into the Nameservers box, you
should park the domain name on the Dotster DNS server, and then use
their Total DNS Control interface to edit THEIR DNS records to forward
all requests to your IP address, where you DNS server is waiting.  The
following two A records are all you need (substitute your own IP
address):

HOST    Points To       TTL
----------------------------
@       70.168.39.139   3600
*       70.168.39.139   3600

The only users who can put meaningful informatin into the Nameservers
boxes are those who own large blocks of IP space handed out by ICANN.
Someone, somewhere, has to resolve your domain name to an IP address.
If ICANN isn't doing it, then you need to have Dotster do it.

I'm not a Dotster user, so I do not know what their web interface looks
like.  I have seen only 1PlanHost and DirectNic, whose interfaces are
identical to one another.  One key difference between the two: 1PlanHost
supplies the Total DNS Control feature for no added cost, while
DirectNic charges an extra 5 bucks a year.  I had to hunt around for it,
and haul out my credit card.

I certainly wouldn't use RW media and UDF for long term archival storage,
but for short term they appear to work well. UDF has sparing tables to
compensate for sectors that die so you shouldn't lose files. UDF also has
the advantage of being very widely supportted so various OSes can read
the filesystems (useful for a removable hard disk).

Yes. If you're lucky and have a drive with good firmware, you won't even
need that option (the +RW drives are supposed to simulate 2K granularity
rewritable sectors, but not all drives actually do). For the majority,
enable that option.

For CD-RWs and DVD-RWs:
cdrwtool -d /dev/cdrw -q (burns the entire media so several minutes)

For DVD+RW:
dvd+rw-format (takes 30 seconds, the + group did do neat things with RW)


modprobe pktcdvd (assuming it is a module)
pktsetup foo /dev/dvdrw (early 2.6 foo needs to be a number, later foo is
an arbitrary string)
mount -t udf /dev/pktcdvd/foo /mnt/mnt -o noatime
(have fun)
umount /mnt/mnt
pktsetup -d foo (no "/dev/pktcdvd/" on the begining!)


For good drives the use of `pktsetup` isn't even needed, directly mount
the device. I'm unsure whether the last step is supposed to be required,
but the drive tends to get locked if you don't do it.

Subject: [PLUG] Syntax to connect to network drive
Message-ID: <20061014224449.4b110996.johnxj@comcast.net>

This has bugged me for a long, and I've not been able to learn how to
do it.

At home I have ethernet, on which I connect my Windows 2000 desktop and
my Ubuntu Dapper laptop. Both computers also go through a switch and
router to the cable modem. It all works just fine (normally).

However, I also have a 250 GB USB disk hanging on the Windows desktop.
I created two partitions on it, which the desktop sees as F and G. I
formatted F as NTFS and have been using it as backup media for the
Windows desktop. That part works fine. I formatted the other partition
as FAT32 and I want to use it as backup media for the laptop. 

I can create an rsync or tar command to do the backup from the laptop.
But on the command line I cannot get the syntax right for rsync to see
and write to the USB disk. Note: Nautilus sees it fine; SAMBA is
working perfectly. The problem is the command line syntax. Lots of //
and :: and stuff that I can't get right. I've read documention on this
for a long time and I can't figure out how many /'s to use and
where to put them. Also, when I access the drive with Nautilus I always
have to pop in my username and password for the Windows desktop, so I
suppose that must be handled as well. Or maybe that will automatically
pop up once I finally figure out how to tell rsync where to copy the
files to. It's the syntax for specifying a network partition that I
can't get right.

The laptop is Devil5 and the desktop is Devil4. So the destination
should be something like //Devil4/G:/Backups/ -- except that doesn't
work, so I must have it wrong. (/Backups is a folder I created on the
G:/ partition on the USB disk.)

I'm sure those of you who work in networking environments can't believe
that someone could not just automatically understand this, but I can't.
Any help is welcome.

First, mount the USB volume:

     mkdir /mnt/smb
     smbmount "//<windows-box-netbios-name>/g$" /mnt/smb

Then rsync to /mnt/smb/Backups.  If ubuntu does not have a smbmount
command, look for mount.smbfs or the like.

Note the g$ notation.  Winblows uses $ for hidden shares.  By default,
every volume can be accessed this way.  Try it on your co-workers'
machines!

Ah! Now I see things much more clearly. It did not occur to me to
*mount* the share.

OK, there is still a problem. First, I went to the Windows desktop and
rearranged things a bit. That is, I just created a new share
(Linux_Backups) so I could mount something with a name I could
remember. Then I tried:

mkdir /media/smb
smbmount "//Devil4/Linux_Backups" /media/smb

And I got "Command not found." So I tried "mount.smbfs" and got the
same error. After googling a bit it appears what I need is (with sudo):

jjj at Devil5:~$ sudo mount -t smbfs "//Devil4/Linux_Backups" /media/smb

That command finally worked, except I got the following error:

mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock
on //Devil4/Linux_Backups, missing codepage or other error
       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail  or so

So I tried:

jjj at Devil5:~$ dmesg | tail

Forget the stuff about Bluetooth -- this computer doesn't even have
Bluetooth. And I was running Audacity earlier; something must have gone
wrong with it. The important line I think is the last one:

[27136.988451] smb_fill_super: missing data argument

Unfortunately, I don't know what it might mean.

It's too late at night to think any more. Tomorrow morning I may get
more ideas. In the meantime, additional suggestions are welcome.

Oh! OK, I'll be there for sure, rain notwithstanding.

Some may have thought it was next week because the first Sunday of
October was the first. I just doesn't feel like the third Sunday yet. :)

Uh, yeah, sorry about forgetting to mention you need to be root.  My
bad.

I'd look for smbmount or mount.smbfs with apt-cache search.  You really
want to use one of these wrapper programs, rather than going the "mount
-t smbfs" route.

Can you access the share with smbclient?  That would be a good
troubleshooting measure to take.  Maybe also try konqueror or nautilus,
if you're a GUI guy.  Using these tools will help you identify share and
NTFS permission issues.  Remember, BOTH share AND NTFS permissions come
into play with winblows shares.  You get the more restrictive of the
two.

Can you access the share from another winblows box on your network?  If
not, time to haul out ethereal (now called wireshark).  Filter for TCP
ports 138 and 139, and UDP ports 137 and 138.  Let a packet trace run
for quite a while (a half hour).  Then look for all packets whose
protocol is "BROWSER".  See if anything looks fishy.  For instance, are
two or more machines battling for master browser?

The kernel config needs to be checked for CIFS support.  In "make
menuconfig":

File systems  --->
     Network File Systems  --->
         <*> SMB file system support (to mount Windows shares etc.)
             [*]   Use a default NLS
             (cp437) Default Remote NLS Option
             <*> CIFS support (advanced network filesystem for Samba, Window and other CIFS compliant servers)
             [*]   CIFS statistics
             [*]     CIFS extended statistics
             [*]   CIFS extended attributes
             [*]     CIFS POSIX Extensions
             [ ]   CIFS Experimental Features (EXPERIMENTAL)

This is how I have my CIFS options set, and it works (even in an AD
domain).  Some settings may be optional.

You are using an appliance router, correct?  In this case, it is highly
unlikely that your machines are getting weird netbios settings from
DHCP.  But it might be worth a check.  For instance, DHCP can tell
clients where to find the wins server, and also whether they should
be allowed to broadcast or not.

The above steps are not in proper order.  I would check the kernel
config first, as that is quick and easy to do, and you'll get nowhere if
it isn't right.  It may be that smbclient (and its GUI companions,
konqueror and nautilus) don't require kernel support.  These may be
tried first as well.  Calling in another winblows box would be dead last
on my list.

OK, it's morning and the coffee is working. I've been googling and
still can't get it to work. But something occurred to
me: //Devil4/Linux_Backups is already mounted. Nautilus sees it and I
can drag and drop files to and from it with Nautilus. Therefore, it
must be mounted, right?

If that is the case, I don't need to mount it. I just need the command
line syntax to put files on it with cp, rsync, tar, etc. I tried:

cp /home/jjj/CheatSheet //Devil4/Linux_Backups/CheatSheet

But that gives me "cp: cannot create regular file
`//Devil4/Linux_Backups/CheatSheet': No such file or directory." I can
drag CheatSheet to the Windows share with Nautilus, but the command
line syntax is wrong. The ls command (and presumably all others) gives
equivalent error messages:

jjj at Devil5:~$ ls //Devil4/Linux_Backups
ls: //Devil4/Linux_Backups: No such file or directory

I think the problem is that I need to figure out where Samba mounted
the share. The mount command doesn't reveal anything obvious to me:

jjj at Devil5:~$ mount
/dev/hda2 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
/sys on /sys type sysfs (rw)
varrun on /var/run type tmpfs (rw)
varlock on /var/lock type tmpfs (rw)
procbususb on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)
udev on /dev type tmpfs (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
devshm on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
/dev/hda3 on /media/hda3 type ext3 (rw)
binfmt_misc on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type binfmt_misc (rw)

How do I figure out where Samba mounted it? Or is my thinking completely wrong?

I think that your situation proves that nautilus (and konqueror and
smbclient) do not mount anything; tht is, they do not employ the kernel
CIFS filesystem support.  Rather, nautilus has its own implementation of
samba-speak.

So off to the kernel config you go!

First I have to figure out how to do that.

In the meantime, I opened Synaptic and discovered that samba and
samba-common were installed, but smbfs was not. I installed it, but it
didn't help. 

Well, off to the Clinic in a little bit. Maybe someone there can
explain how Samba is supposed to work. It's always easier to learn in
person.

I've got pretty aggressive spam fighting measures in Postfix (See main.cf

Perhaps you could try mount -t cifs instead of smbfs.

apt-file finds out what files belong to what package:

$ apt-file search giftopnm
netpbm: usr/bin/giftopnm
netpbm: usr/share/man/man1/giftopnm.1.gz

Before you run apt-file for the first time, set it up with this command:

$ apt-file update

Re-run this every so often to keep it up to date.

What does it mean when there's no response from a web site, and the 
attempt to connect to it doesn't time out? Firefox just says, 
"Connecting to www.ccel.org" and never changes.

I've been to web sites that are broken, but usually I get some kind of 
error message after a short while. This one's still waiting after about 
10 minutes.

Just tried it myself, connected to "Christian Classics Ethereal Library" 
website. Took less than a minute.

Anything in dmesg, or other log files?

Nothing in dmesg related to Firefox. The last thing has to do with the 
last time I shut down VMware.

What other log files should I check?

I still get no response from Firefox on this machine. I now get a time 
out alert from Firefox on my Win98 machine, and I get this message from 
Konqueror on this machine:

-----------------------------------------------------
An error occurred while loading http://www.ccel.org/:
Timeout on server
  Connection was to www.ccel.org at port 80
-----------------------------------------------------

It took less than a minute to get those messages.

As soon as I finished sending my last response, I got this message from 
Firefox:

The connection was reset

The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading.

     *   The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try 
again in a few moments.

     *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's 
network connection.

     *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or 
proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.

Try again.

I'm guessing they're having intermittent problems, and that you were 
able to get to them at one time, but I was not at another time.

I just loaded this web page using Ubuntu 5.10 and Firefox 1.5.0.7.  It 
took a while to load (about 45 seconds), but it did.

Works fine for me now, too.

I'm guessing they may have been having some issues to resolve, and have 
done so.

I had a problem resolving the web site while using openDNS as my nameserver but
gmail (google) didn't have a problem sending mail.  Haven't tried recently.

I don't think that mount will autoload smbfs.ko so you might want to do
modprobe smbfs prior to doing the mount -t smb

Thanks Carla. I didn't have an apt-file (?), but I had apt-cache that Aaron at the clinic suggested I use. I searched for netpbm on the Synaptic Package Manager, downloaded what it found and now I have the utilities I wanted. Along with manpages!

I have found that what management really cares about is cost. Cost of
migrating, cost of licensing, cost of hardware, and ongoing cost of
ownership. If you can spell things out in dollars and cents, they will go
for it. They probably don't care that penguins are cute. Although, you are
right... penguins are cute.

I have found that to be false in most cases.  Otherwise why would anyone 
ever buy a Windows print server CAL?

What they want is security.  They want to go with what makes them 
comfortable, no matter how much more it costs them.  If they believe that 
Windows will give them that "warm and fuzzy experience", then they will go 
with Windows.  For some shops it is Solaris.  Others it is Oracle.

Cost is rarely the number one reason for any management choice.  They are 
managers, not accountants.  (Besides...  If they don't spend all of their 
budget, they get less next year.)

Sometimes the "warm and fuzzy experience" has to do with indirect (but 
real) financial expenses...

 * avoidance of official IT infrastructure is a financial expense,
   because it means that employees are having to spend time to
   develop their own solutions, and usually not very efficiently.

 * employees who stovepipe their own IT solutions often do so using
   tools that aren't designed with corporate security in mind.
   whether the problem is information leaks or inbound viruses,
   cleanup is a financial expense.

 * spending time answering questions from cranky users or addressing
   problems introduced by software that doesn't work as most
   employees think it should is a real financial cost.

...but sometimes the cost isn't financial...

 * getting berated in management meetings or losing status in an
   organization sometimes involves financial costs (less budget
   next year), but often the cost is psychological.

 * there's also a high psychological price to pay by IT staffers
   who perceive that their work is being dismissed by their
   co-workers; it's harder to work with people in a "bad mood."

I was speaking of IT management.

When I worked for NCD, there were cheaper, more stable solutions.  But 
because of comfort issues we went with the more expensive options.

And they paid for it too.  Most of the time was spent keeping the three 
multi-user NT boxes and the one Outlook server running.  The rest of the 
Unix boxes were managed to require little heavy lifting.

But there is always the assumption that they people making the decisions 
are doing so for rational reasons and not just what they last read in the 
management magazines or something they read while traveling.

More IT decisions are based on what an article said than it was by asking 
someone who actually understood all of the issues.

About the UNIX/Linux issue ...

What I've seen is companies wanting to contract and not hire support staff. Reasons are I surmise that they don't want full-time people that are not directly generating revenue and it's much easier to let a contract expire or cancel one than it is to lay off employees.

Companies that used to have full-time security people and full-time building maintenance, now often contract that out.

There are support Linux companies that one can contract with, but (and please correct me if I'm wrong) they appear to be small ops and not general comp support -- that is, you contract for specific apps and configs.

This discussion about dumping UNIX for Linux brings up Microsoft and I don't think Microsoft is doing UNIX support currently, but then I don't really know.

I'm sure this is not the only issue ... many other valid ones brought up here. But it's definitely part of the mix.

ee, I have Microshaft on the brain. I should have said "big commercial vendors 
have the advantage of superior incentivizationability of technically 
non-astute managers and decision-makers."

Uh ... IBM?  Novell?  Redhat?  Expensive, but quite large and
general.  If you mean there are no large local Linux support shops
like there is for M$, that is true but not really important (unless
you are looking for a job in such a shop).

There are some perfectly adequate general-purpose local Linux support
companies;  there is a list at www.possepdx.org .  Some of them will
grow quite large in time, as the need appears;  there is certainly
enough local talent to grow out of.  But one real advantage of Linux
compared to other non-Unix systems is that it can be securely supported 
from anywhere.  I don't /need/ any more than a local screwdriver jockey
to physically maintain systems.  Software/application wise, experts in
Europe or Asia can (in principle) maintain my machines as well as an
expert in Tigard can.  I contract locally because good talent is here,
and I suspect that the talent suppliers will grow faster than I can. 
The fact that I /like/ these folks as well is a pure bonus.

I'll put a plug in for the folks at OpenSourcery 
(www.opensourcery.com), a Portland-based IT and development company. 
They can provide general as well as more specialized support.

And John is instrumental in making that happen.  One thing, though;
we are all there to have fun, and solving small Linux problems is
fun.  Solving huge problems is work, and not fun.


One of the larger problems we have is people bringing in odd bits
of hardware they picked up cheap and expecting us to get them going.
The most common example of such hardware is cheap Frys wifi cards
for laptops.  We have good success with Atheros G chipsets and with
PRISM-II B chipsets, but most cheap cards use Windoze-only chipsets
with poor or nonexistent Linux support.  That is the nature of
Wifi cards, and it is rooted in FCC requirements supported by
proprietary vendors.  That said, some vendors "get it", and you
should support them.  You have to do some study of individual card
types, and the chipsets they use, BEFORE you buy them.  If you don't
know that a card will work, DON'T BUY IT, and DON'T expect the clinic
volunteers to compensate for your carelessness.  There is plenty
of good wireless hardware that you can buy with good manufacturer
support for Linux.  Here are two good lists of working chipsets:

  http://www.seattlewireless.net/HardwareComparison
  http://www.linux-wlan.org/docs/wlan_adapters.html.gz

And if that is too hard, just look for Senao NL-2511 (PRISM-2.5) on
the web and buy those.   Cheap and good range.  They are not G cards,
but how often does the wireless access point connect to something
faster than 11 Mbps anyway?  

If your laptop has builtin wireless, you might be able to get that
running with some work.  However, laptop builtin chipsets are often
obscure (we spent 4 hours fighting a Broadcom BCM43xx chipset), and
even if you get them running they are typically low power with limited
range.  Personally, I prefer a card that I can pull out and keep in
my pocket - then I can be sure I am offline, whether or not my software
has been damaged, and I am not wasting battery power while offline.

You can get many windows drivers to work with something called 
"ndiswrapper" - sometimes that works, often it does not.  It is just
one more thing that can go wrong.

The Linux clinic is currently being held at FreeGeek;  wireless service
there is "special".  Most of the time it works good, but if there is
someone in another part of the building using wireless then the diversity
antennas may point at them rather than you.  There are other open APs
nearby that can interfere.  In general, it is not a very good place
to debug Linux wireless, and most of the volunteers are not wireless 
experts.  Fortunately, I was able to help one fellow debug an Atheros
chipset DLINK WNA-2330 card (after we fixed yum and found a spot in
the building that would connect) but two other fellows were not so
lucky, and there was much hair pulling and gnashing of teeth.  

One way to deal with wireless cards and laptops would be to schedule
quarterly "wireless days", perhaps in conjunction with the Personal
Telco Project.  We would want a venue where we control the wireless 
environment (our own AP, no others in range), good connectivity (for
looking up things on the web, and downloading drivers) and plenty of
wireless savvy people (Tom Higgins, Don Park and Russell Senior 
spring immediately to mind, but there are plenty of others).  This
would not be a monthly thing.

Also, since the lists above are kind of old, it would be handy to
do a monthly "store scan" to update a list of currently available
wireless cards at Frys and Compusa and Bestbuy (and other stores
that carry them) and then research them for chipsets and drivers.
That does not require a rocket scientist, anyone who wants to 
contribute to the community can do that.  We can divide cards into
"easy", "difficult", and "impossible".  Impossible cards will be
taken out to the sidewalk and stomped.  You Have Been Warned.

And for built-in wifi - assume that doesn't work.  If you get it
working, that's wonderful.  Write down what you did and share it
with others.  But just because somebody somewhere got the built-in
working with their own particular setup, that doesn't mean we can
get YOURS working in just a few hours.  It is far easier to buy a
card that lots of people have gotten working with many versions of
Linux.  You paid >$500 for the laptop; be a mench and spend >$40 
for a wireless card.

Not sure about morphs, didn't even try. But it seems it would mean 
something along the lines of how susceptible one or a group would be 
conditioned to looking for and possibly accepting incentives. Just a guess.

I wish I would have been there.  I have that driver working.

It is now supported by the kernel, but you have to find the firmware 
packages.  They can either be obtained from the debian packages or 
seperated from the Windows drivers with an application in Fedora.

I agree 100% with Wil.  It is the APPLICATIONS that count.
If this wasn't true I would never ever run Windows.

Linux is easier to use than most other Unix OSs, and it 
has tons and tons of ready to load applications available
for it.  Has a result, it makes a wonderful desktop for 
lots of people.  I personally prefer Linux to Windows
or Mac OS because:

    -  It is easy to administrate
       (This is also true of any good Unix.
       Some people even think Windows is easy to administrate, but I 
       have trouble.)
    -  It is easy and friendly to use 
       (at least for a power user like most PLUG members)
       Most other Unix OSs have desktops similar to Linux, but they
       aren't quite as nice.
    -  There are tons of OpenSource applications for Linux
       (These can be ported to most any Unix or even Windows, but they 
       are usually ready to run on my Linux desktop without any pain at all.)
    -  Linux networks well with any Unix machine
       This makes it easy to use specialized proprietary applications on
       proprietary Unix computers without the expense of giving everyone
       a proprietary Unix computer.
    -  Linux sort of works with Windows thanks to products like
       Samba, Wine, and VMWare.
       This isn't perfect, but it is better than many proprietary Unix 
       computers do.

On the other hand, I would never restrict myself entirely to Linux.
Many applications (mostly proprietary) are only available for Windows
or some proprietary Unix.  If you need SAS or ArcInfo you need to 
run something other than Linux.  Moreover, Linux is getting more
and more stable, but it still lacks features some people need in
enterprise computing.  At least, I think it does.  This becomes less
true everyday.


                                          Sincerely,

In theory yes, in practice the results are a bit more murky, at least in
present circumstances.  RedHat support isn't cheap, and the lock-in isn't
any less substantial in most cases.

It works like this:

An ERP app requires Oracle to run.

Oracle is supported on X,Y,Z (commerical, pay for support) linux distros,
Solaris and Windows.

No one in their right mind runs Oracle on Windows.

 Since the stacks are vertically integrated, it's basically a toss up
between Solaris and Redhat and/or SuSE if you want support from both
Oracle and the ERP vendor.  Regardless of the kool-aid you end up
drinking, you're probably going to end up spending roughly the same
amount;  uptime, stability and CYA still costs $.

Coincidentally, this is probably why Larry Ellison wants to create his own
Linux Distro.

Regards,
Max

If you run a windows shop, and have no expertise in linux or unix, then a
"Windows print server CAL" may be a more cost effective solution that open
source alternatives. All software has a cost, even if the licensing is free.
In some cases, it is more cost effective to buy software with a big price
tag from a vendor than it is to use an open source solution or to develop an
in-house solution. Management like to rely on vendor provided support for
the "warm fuzzy feeling" you describe. This is directly related to the cost
of ownership. Security, in the sense that you mention, is very important.
Again, I think this is related to cost of ownership. Managers like to be
able to predict costs. If they know there is a licensing and support cost
that is payable to a vendor, it becomes a line item in the budget. If you
decide to use an open source solution, your cost is a big question mark. How
much will it cost to implement, support, fix bugs, resolve issues? Sure, you
can estimate these cost, but what if you're wrong? How much variation
between the estimated cost and the actual cost can be tollorated. These
things play a huge deciding factor when management chooses a solution.

But there are free versions that give you exactly the same thing as the 
supported version without the support. (i.e. Centos.)

It may cost you time and work, but the GPL does keep you from getting 
locked in to a specific vendor.

You did remember to save all those Source RPMS?

Only if one considers IBM and HP as "small ops."  Debian was originally
supported primarily by Pixar Animation Studios of all places, and when
Software in the Public Interest took over the Debian Project, HP became the
big sponsor and was Debian's primary financial sponsor for almost a decade.

Microsoft forked XENIX off AT&T UNIX System V in 1979, support ended in 1987
when Microsoft sold XENIX to the orignal SCO (now known as Tarantella, Inc)
so they could focus on OS/2 and Windows.

The nice thing is Microsoft announced two months back that Vista will be
Microsoft's last operating system so they can focus on virtualization and
their console products.  Good riddance!

And I got the cheap Fry's card running, before I bought the Atheros
mini-PCI card I'm now using. It's not hard, but it IS tedious the first
time. The $45 for the miniPCI card is money well spent for so many
reasons.

Your main problem is that you listed a non-nameserver as nameserver
for your domain.  Resolvers will randomly choose one of the
nameservers listed for the domain.  They do not try the first and
fallback to the second. If they choose the non-responsive one, they
will wait for the timeout (I think it is 2 sec) until they try the
other one.  Resolvers may be smart enough to cache the fact that one
of the nameservers was non-responsive and use the other one for later
queries.  But the first query for the domain has a 50% chance of being
really slow.

Well, here's a how-to from the Gentoo Wiki (don't you use Gentoo, Carlos?)

http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Packet_Writing_on_CD-RW

More to Paul's point, though, I just don't trust packet writing as a 
method for archiving.  I don't know if, overall, DVD+RW media are any 
more reliable than CD-RW, but I have read people complaining about some 
data becoming unreadable six months or so after the burn.  That was my 
experience with CD-RW, so I just stay away.  OTOH, it could be useful 
for reusable short-term data transfer in some situations, and people 
probably have other uses for it that go way beyond my needs, skills, 
and/or interests.  Me, I just stay away.

When you logically AND the linux distro support choice lists for all
your corporate products, you'll find that it's down to redhat or suse.
Oracle may support redhat, suse and asianux, while vmware supports all
these plus a few more, but IBM and Dell only support redhat and suse,
period.  The support number you're most likley to call is the one for
your hardware vendor.

I had initially considered a wiring/hardware problem, as I'm always
suspect to that sort of thing (I should really start labeling things as
"known good").

To test the hardware (the cable), I set the Metrix box to serve DHCP
via eth0.  The laptop is configured to obtain its IP via DHCP.  I connected
the two directly and viola, the laptop gets and IP.  So I'm fairly confident
in my cables.  I perhaps I should suspect the network admins.  For
another quick test, I'll power up a router and connect the Metrix box
to that to see if it can get an IP.

In some circles it seems odd to reply to your own posts, but I figured
I'd let you know that the DHCP client on the Metrix box works afterall.
I powered up a little router I had lying around and plugged eth0 of the
Metrix box into the router.

A quick "ifup eth0" later and its got an IP.  I guess I'll have to consult
the LAN admin elite in my building.

Thanks for all your suggestions.

IIRC, HP was until recently a sponsor of Debian, and I think they still
provide commercial support.  http://debian.org/consultants can help here.

I was thinking in cruder terms, like "bribes." But yours is quite good.

Here is a partial list of Linux vendors who sell white boxes with no operating 
systems or Linux preinstalls:

Have you explored using Enterprise DB in lieu of Oracle.

Its an open source solution to Oracle. They tout that you can run most
oracle apps unchanged. I heard that Sony Online just dumped all its
oracle instances and are using it, saving buko $$$.
Just a thought.

I think you are using the Dotster admin tool incorrectly.  You should
not use the 2 hostname text boxes to enter your DNS server location.
These are meant for those customers who own large blocks of IP address
space, given out by ICANN.  A private individual like you or me will
never be able to play ball in this league.  If I am mistaken, and you
are a company who has a block of IP space doled out by ICANN, then my
bad.

Instead, you should look for a feature caled "Total DNS Control" or
something similar.  I use 1PlanHost (Windows servers, I know, but I
started using them years ago and now I'm stuck).  A friend of mine who
uses DirectNic has the identical-looking admin interface.  This makes
me think that the interface is common to many domain registrars.
Anyway, the idea is this: instead of telling the internet that your
DNS server is the primary nameserver for your domain, you should
instead let Dotster be the primary DNS server, and use the tools
provided to customize their DNS records to simply point all requests
to your IP address.

I have ten domain names set up with 1PlanHost, and they all have DNS
records that look exactly like this:

A RECORDS:
@  	70.168.39.139  	3600
* 	70.168.39.139 	3600

Notice the lack of CNAMEs and MX records.  These two A records suffice
to send all requests directly to my IP address, into the arms of my
DNS server.  Every request for one of my domain names goes to
1PlanHost first, and then to me.

Where you attempted to put your DNS server information, you should
instead click the "Default Parked Nameservers" button, thereby letting
Dotster be the "real" DNS server.  Once you park your domain name(s)
on Dotster's DNS server, you can edit their records as described
above.

I get the Total DNS Control feature for no extra charge with
1PlanHost, but my DirectNic buddy had to pay an extra $5 to get the
feature, even though the web interface is identical.  I had to hunt
around a bit to find where I could purchase the feature for him.

I wish I could put screenshots in this post, but I cannot.  If you
would like some, I can send an email directly to you (provided you can
receive it).

Subject: [PLUG] Version creep and patching...
Message-ID: <1160947131.28430.50.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

What are the major problems being found in perl that perl 5.008
is not very compatible with perl 5.8.0?  Isn't a newer version of 
a program generally supposed to be compatible with older versions?

I often hear, "you have to upgrade or you are insecure."  Well, some
hardware won't run the newest version of Linux.  The Linux community
needs to reign in the bloat and realize that increasing complexity in
the kernel is starting to become a major problem for people trying to
use it effectively.  I'd say that inadequate documentation for the 2.4
kernel is a problem that has carried over to 2.6 in spades.  How many
people wonder if they have something when attempting to configure the
2.6.18 kernel and don't know what decision to make?  If that which is
not in the kernel tarball to explain the choices is on the net, what
good does that do anyone?  With sufficient bloat, not everyone can go 
to the Net to download everything they need.  Oddly enough, most 
Americans are still limited to dial-up connections magnifying the 
bloat issue greatly.

I don't know of any series of standard places one can look if some
portion of the kernel documentation is wrong about where to go for 
a particular option.  I don't know how to follow library changes, I
am not a highly skilled programmer.  Heck, most people aren't
programmers at all.

Upgrading is not always a viable solution.  Sometimes you don't know
what you are breaking.  My Maple 9.0.2 for Linux does not seem to run
on any Linuce that's newer than Fedora Core 1.  How often is it
reasonable to do a major upgrade?  It seems that Fedora supports more
than it's Enterprise cousins, but it turns over so rapidly.  The
enterprise variants are very limited in new hardware support, so one
loses on the equipment side of the equation.  I think dropping 386
support in Slackware 10.1 was the wrong move.  For Linux to be better
then the alternatives, it needs to be the best choice for the hardware
that exists already and the hardware of tomorrow.  Fragmentation after
Windows 2000 evidently upset many Windows advocates and is potentially
lowering consumer and corporate demand for it.  Is the Linux community
making the same mistake?

Should I remind everyone, within the past three months the evaluation
download for VMWare Workstation 5.5 was still distributed for Fedora
Core 3?  If FC3 is so ancient and off official support, what is with
the producers of VMware?  On the topic of VMWare, why is sound support
only partial under Fedora Core 3?  Nothing like hearing only one 
channel of a stereo connection.  I still haven't gotten VMWare
Workstation 5.5 to run on Fedora Core 5.

Anyone starting with Linux today will probably run into upgrade 
issues sooner than later.  Even if you stick to purchased 
"Enterprise" distributions, the problem isn't completely avoided.

Internet speeds are not keeping up with growth.  The Internet which made
Linux both possible and successful is becoming rapidly overloaded.  If
the Internet falls will Linux fall with it?

Isn't putting up a non nameserver as your last name server a standard
anti abuse tactic?  Don't the weights put on nameservers mean anything
anymore?  Isn't querying a site's last nameserver first non standard
behavior?  The whole point of having two nameservers is that one of them,
either one, could be down.

Wow -- I tried to send this last Saturday or Sunday, and it didn't go
due to graylisting of my hostname (I was messing with VM for emacs at
the time).  Guess it finally went.  Meanwhile, I assumed it would never
get delivered, and I sent another post in its stead.  Sorry for the
duplication.

How in Fedora Core 3, etc., do you enable support for
older versions of NFS and perl?  Can I run an NFS
version 2,3, and 5 server?  Can I support perl
5.008 and perl 5.8?

Hmm, these versions coming out from perl --version are fairly close.
However, I doubt this means that perl-Storable etc. is upgraded.

What weights?  You may be thinking aobut MX records for mail servers
which do have weights.  And putting in a bogus (or honeypot)
high-weight MX record is a tatic for reducing spam.  NS records don't
have weights or ordering.  Like A records, the resolver randomly
orders the list to load balance access to the servers.  The point of
having two nameservers is that if one of them is down, the other will
be evenutally accessed.

if people would only fix problems and never implement new features, that
would be true. In reality, the very start of a new project is decided
by new features, thus backwards compatibility is always an issue, and
never sure.

Unless you're talking about a 386 with 8mb memory, I'd say that's wrong -
almost no hardware has been 'defeatured' and removed support for in the
kernel. Plenty of new additions in recent 2.6 kernels allow even smaller
systems to run this kernel too!

The kernel process works the other way: new hardware is not supported in
*old* kernels, not the other way around.

everlasting discussion, can't be solved: today you want things to be
more stable, tomorrow you want your new system to be supported. You
can never make up your mind as a customer: you want both, and at the
same time.

not the kernel community problem to solve! Have you tried mail-ordering
CD's? there's tons of people providing this service... Seriously!

I was disconnected for a while with only dialup access and intermediate
hi-speed, and with patience and planning I was able to regularly develop
and partake in large projects. It's all possible.

You shouldn't be trying to compile/run your own kernel then, but really use
a mainstream distribution targeted at you :) ["and just shell out the
bucks too, just like you take the 3-year SEARS service plan for the fridge!"]

Companies like RH will support old installations for up to 7 years on the
original installation with fixes only. Perhaps that's what you need?

> I think dropping 386 support in Slackware 10.1 was the wrong move.

Why? are you certain that the small slackware community could test the
new software and features on this hardware properly? If they decided to
keep maintaining i386, they might waste so many resources on it that
they effectively kill progress in the rest of the project. If you value
your project, you keep it alive, but not in suspended animation!

again, 2.6.18 supports pretty much all old hardware, so I completely disagree
with your suggestion that newer kernels don't support old hardware anymore.

In a personal note: I've crashed and burned trying to 'remove' or 'suspend'
hardware support in the kernel already a few times. even the suggestion of
'removal' is completely not accepted by the kernel community.

It's a closed-source shop, with not a huge amount of interest in paying
back into open source. Why complain to the linux community about them?

Once they figured out how to support fc3, they like to keep their
current customers supported, so obviously they'll work harder on that
than on supporting newer customers.

Involves patching vmware code with some random russian guys' patches and
messing with their startup files, and yes: that's insane.

Perl 5.008 and 5.8.0 are the same version.  The older way of
representing Perl version numbers is as a floating point number.  So
5.8.8 is 5.008008.

Fedora is not the best distribution is you want compatibility and
stability.  They have been aggressive in introducing new technologies
and in deprecating old ones.  For example, FC5 provides glibc 2.4
which removes the old LinuxThreads support.    Fedora tends to
introduce new versions of packages instead of backporting fixes.  RHEL
is much better about providing compatibility packages and they
backport fixes instead of releasing new updates.    Backporting fixes
and providing compatibility is a lot of work which is why Redhat
charges for their support.

Actually, it was held for moderation because you posted with an address

 Have you explored using Enterprise DB in lieu of Oracle.

It doesn't matter.  If problems happen, and they always do, once the ERP
vendor discovers you're not using contract compliant software, you're
exposed to risks and liabilities that you would not otherwise be exposed
to.

In situations where you control the stack (custom in-house developed
applications) you don't have the same sort of problems.  But you're
average ERP (Just an example) situation is not the same as an internally
engineered system.

Sony Online spends a significant portion of $ on developing said system,
so they can assume that risk... Many other shops do this, but those
projects are typically run by the HR department :)

There are some distros that specialize in supporting older hardware.

Well, as long as the release you're dealing is supportted, you can patch.
Patches tend to be very small changes, hopefully the absolute minimum
needed to patch the security problem. Once the version you're dealing
with is no longer supportted by the distribution, you do have to upgrade
or be insecure (or roll your own, but that is a PITA). If you don't like
upgrades, you go with RHEL, SuSE, Debian or one based on those, enjoy the
long upgrade cycles, but endure software that is older. If you need to be
on the bleeding edge, you go with Fedora, Debian-unstable or another
such distribution, but have to bleed (upgrade frequently). There is a
whole spectrum here, depending on how often you're willing to deal with
upgrades and how close to the edge you wish to be.

Well, as already mentioned, if you can't deal with sparse documentation,
*don't*! Leave it to the distribution to make choices that aren't
optimal, but cover 90% of the cases. If neither of these is acceptable,
then hire a professional system administrator, they're expensive, but
that is because they will deal with these problems.

As far as bloat, well some distributions do go for the eye candy. If you
need a minimal system, that is quite doable too. On occasion I deal with
a PPro 200 system. Obviously Gentoo is hopeless for that system, but that
is why it doesn't use Gentoo. Does surprisingly well given its age. What
were you commenting about older hardware not working with recent
distributions/software? If you can't handle it, there are plenty of

compared to what companies like a certain Redmond company *requires*.

Again, if bandwidth is an issue, use a smaller install. Also avoid full

Yes, and that is why you go with a stable distribution that doesn't
require you to be a programmer. You choose to either deal with
difficulties on the bleeding edge, or you go for something where you
don't have to, but don't get the latest thing. You don't get both, so
make your choice.

Again, it is the same choice. Bleeding edge or support. You don't get
both unless someone puts in a *lot* of time. This can be you, or someone
paid by you. Make the choice.

How many 80386 class machines are still out there? Sorry, but they're
dying. If you're really that desperate to use an old machine, then the
time has to be spent. The distribution folks rightfully are moving beyond
because it is too much time for them for a trivial number of machines.
Even a WRT54GL is many times faster than an 80386 machine! The cost to
replace one with a faster machine is pennies! Far cheaper to replace them
than spend the hours of time for support.

Why is this decision such a bad one?

Again, make your bloody choices and live with them! You cannot have the
whole world bowing at your feet to suit your whims unless you're willing
to pay the cost either directly in time, or indirectly with money.

Fedora is a *bleeding* edge distribution! They say very clearly that
their support cycle is a grand total of 2 years, *period* (and even that
is far longer than they originally planned on). If you do not understand
that, then what point would there be in additional documentation in the
kernel for obviously you would not bother to read it?

If you want support then choose a different bloody distribution!

Yeah, enterprise systems say 5 years, though often it extends a little
bit beyond that. That is what companies demand, and they are willing to
pay for that. They also get distributions that have older software. They
just plan ahead and a software upgrade once every 5 years isn't that big
a deal.

Make your choice and live with it. Don't go ranting about something
you're not willing to pay for in time or money.

Hi all,

   Just checking to see if you all have any standard practices or tips
when it comes to server forensics.
   We had an instance where an administrator installed an FC4 box
outside our firewall and while testing the machine he stopped iptables.
DOH! Wouldn't you know it, in no time a pesky little hermit crab(not to
offend hermit crab lovers) scrambled along and crawled in. This
particular crab used the server as an IRC server and for some attacks
and reconnaissance(this is how the administrator was alerted to the
intrusion). Immediately the admin unplugged the network cable and
shutdown the machine(we try to teach them not to shut the machine down
but those darn knee jerk reactions take over sometimes). 
   I have currently booted into knoppix mounted the lvm and studied it a
little. I am also scp'ing the contents of the lvm to another machine for
a more intense look. It appears that this particular hermit crab
connected consistently from one IP address in Romania. By the looks of
it I wouldn't doubt if this was his IP. He did nothing to conceal his
work on the server. We have the complete history file all his scripts
and links to where he houses his scripts(a bank of scripts on a
geocities site and an irc server camouflaged as a pdf on an undisclosed
server etc.). Pretty interesting really.
   Thanks in advance for the help and tips.

Subject: [PLUG] Asus M2N-SLI Deluxe mb BIOS setup problem
Message-ID: <453692A0.70709@bctonline.com>

Hi,
I just bought a computer from Cool Tech PC, Inc in Vancouver, WA 
(endpcnoise.com). I ordered it without Windows installed since I plan to 
run Ubuntu on it. They did a 48 hour burn-in with Windows and then wiped 
the disk and declared the computer ready. When, when I try to run Ubuntu 
live/install 6.06.1 LTS the first error message I get is

       "Detect drives done: not any drive found".

Then the "Start or Install Ubuntu" screen comes up and when I click this 
I get the following BIOS error message:
    
    MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO_APIC
    Kernal Panic - not syncing: IO-APIC + timer doesn't work!
    Boot with apic=debug and send a report. Then try booting with the 
"noapic" option.

I was able to format the drive using a GParted Live CD so it found the 
HD OK and the problem appears to be strictly in the bios setup for the 
motherboard. When I called Cool Tech about the problem they suggested 
that I Google the net or bring the computer back and they would install 
Ubuntu for $40. Perhaps this is the best solution but I thought I would 
first see if any of you good people could offer any suggestions and save 
myself another trip to Vancouver. If they regularly install Ubuntu then 
they must have known that I would run into this problem when I tried to 
install. Here is a summary of the system - motherboard et al:
    
Asus M2N-SLI Deluxe Motherboard
AMD Athlon 64 AM2 X2 Dual Core 3800 CPU
2GB ( two 1GB ) PC-5300 Kingston memory
56K V.92 PCI Hardware modem
Microsoft BLACK Keyboard/Mouse Combo
Samsung Quiet 160GB SATA2 HDD HD160JJ
No Operating System
Nexus 500W NX5000 Power Supply
MSI NX6200TC 256MB PCIE (Fanless)
Antec P180 BLACK Case
Plextor (Beige or Black) PX-760A DVDRW
Zalman CNPS9500AM2 CPU Cooler

The bottom line message may be -- don't try to buy a Linux system from a 
Windows shop.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Or at least take something with to test the system out first.  A live
CD of some kind, like Knoppix, or in your case just take the Ubuntu
live CD with when you go to make the purchase, and leave the computer
there (taking your money with you) until it works.  There's no greater
incentive to a vendor than money literally walking out the door.

You can try the following BIOS test kit:

Depending on the vendor you may approach them and see if you can get a
customized contract to support your db of choice. Most of those sales
persons are eager to please. If not, check with their competitors. And
let them know that you are. ;)

Bingo! It's all about credibility, predictability, track records and

CentOS is "binary compatible" with RHEL but it is absolutely, positively
not "exactly the same thing" as RHEL. I've used CentOS, and I like it
for what it is ... if you like boring, stable Linux platforms, it's
fine, but then, so is Debian "Sarge", and if all goes well, "Etch" in
December. :)

Why bother to save the source RPMs? Red Hat posts them on their FTP
server, as required by the GPL. :)

When you come right down to it, a Linux distro is composed of:

1. A Linux kernel,
2. The GNU utilities and tool chain, compilers, editors, etc.,
3. Networking and associated tools,
4. An X windows implementation,
5. A package management system, and
6. Office/desktop, workstation and server applications.

Layered on top of this will be a community, a corporation, or both.

Along these lines, one of the things that never ceases to amaze me is
that businesses run production servers and desktops on Fedora rather
than CentOS. In other words, they believe a community distro "blessed by
Red Hat" is better in some sense than something that's binary compatible
with RHEL.

I'd say that that's the *last* thing that they look at, and most people will choose a 
distro based on things like hearsay and personal experience. I doubt that anyone will 
pick CentOS of Fedora because "it is closer to what RHEL is", because that is a very 
poor argument to make, and doesn't say anything about whether you like it or not, and why.

Did you try booting with the "noapic" option?

Did you try Googling?

You'd be surprised, but other people tried running Linux on that board:
http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-bugs at lists.ubuntu.com/msg67698.html

http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/2005/03/17/msi-rs480m2-il-athlon-64-motherboard-mini-review

In sum: It's a sucky board, possibly under recall, but there's a kernel
patch that may help.  Booting with noapic helps, as does enabling the
IDE compatibility mode on the SATA controller.

I just finished an EE degree so I could get out, but I'd recommend an
MCSE[1] cert to anyone who wants to break into the exciting world of
systems administration[2].  Not because you'll actually use whatever you
memorized to pass the tests, but because you're much more likely to get
hired by the e-ignoramuses who make such decisions.

Add a CCNA and you're a High-Dollar Network Engineer.  Combine with a
Linux cert and you're Cross-Platform.  RHCE is the best-known, but LPI
is way cheap through Free Geek and studying for it is amazingly educational.

Oh, and don't forget to deduct training costs off your taxes.

It's all about the keywords on the resume,

It doesn't amaze me at all, really. It all depends on what you want, 
and the time you're willing to invest.

While I was at OGI, I relied on Fedora for login servers and desktop 
workstations. Fedora provided tools of recent vintage that tended to 
work better with newer hardware. Prior to each Fall term, I'd nuke and 
repave all the Fedora machines. It took some time to figure out what 
configuration files needed tweaking, but getting the newer tools was 
worth the investment in time.

The amazing thing is that people install Fedora while desiring 
long-term stability in the face of Internet-borne threats...

CentOS or Red Hat were better choices for machines that offer stable, 
always-on network services: DNS, DHCP, RADIUS, web, e-mail, database, 
calendaring, file services, and what-not. Living with increasingly 
fossilized (albeit maintained) versions of service software was worth 
the stability they offered.

The amazing thing is that people install RHEL/CentOS while desiring a 
bleeding-edge toolset...

Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses -- and I've always found 
myself in situations where I need both, because they solve different 
problems.

Wow. First, everyone knows that MCSE especially, and CCNA's to a lesser
degree, don't know much. PHB's don't normally make the hiring decisions,
it's the people who already do the work. After you get the interview,
it's all about technical knowledge rather than certs. Do feel free to
state "instructor-level knowledge for CCNP and RHCE," that works well
for getting past HR :)

I do agree that getting certs (shady business, as the cert industry is)
is a good way to get entry-level jobs. Afterward, experience and
networking (the people kind) are what's required. It's really scary to
explain technical things to MCSE's sometimes.. and yes they do make
decent money. But if you ever want to get out of the rage they're in, it
won't happen with only cert knowledge.

And finally, CCNA holders don't get high-dollar wages. Many people
looking for mid-level network engineers won't even consider CCNA's. They
might consider a CCNP holder, if you have tons of experience too, but
you're really better off not going the cert route.

I've had my head buried in writing a book for the past

it called now? Is it shipping yet?) have a built-in
firewall whose functionality comes anywhere close to
Linux Netfilter/iptables?

I'd have to agree 100% with what BOTH Aaron and Charlie wrote.  For my
planned career an MCSE is useless for everything EXCEPT getting by the
HR department who will be screening the resumes before the hiring
manager ever sees one.  And there it's well nigh indispensable.  But I'm
working on my LPI now and don't have time (or the inclination) to pursue
a MS cert now.  I have these Windows resources that will go to the
library tomorrow unless I find someone who wants them.  No point in
letting them become obsolete dust collectors in my closet.

Plenty of other books on VB and various other nooks and crannies of the
MS world going as well.  Holler if interested.

Afaict, you have three choices with Windows Server 2003:

1. Simple TCP/IP filtering on a per-interface basis:

   Network Connections -> $INTERFACE -> Local Area Connection
   Properties -> Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties ->
   Advanced TCP/IP Settings -> TCP/IP filtering

   The default is to let all traffic pass; exceptions are blocked.

2. Stateful packet analysis/filtering using Internet Connection
   Firewall (ICF). When enabled, ICF's default setting is to
   deny unsolicited inbound traffic. Exceptions must be made
   explicit. There's a logging module, but it's not as configurable
   as netfilter.

   Note that ICF can't do masquerading; that's handled by the
   Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) application.

   Both ICF and ICS are included with the most popular versions of
   Windows Server 2003.

3. For extra $$, you can purchase the Microsoft Internet Security
   and Acceleration (ISA) Server, a software suite that application-
   level filtering and proxy capabilities.

Message-ID: <45380433.2080502@bctonline.com>

Hi,
Thanks Jason and Aaron for responding to the above subject.  I took the 
computer back to Cool Tech to let them install Ubuntu, i.e., get the 
bios set up properly. It turns out that they use the non-graphics 
install iso.  The Live CD doesn't  have the 'noapic' option according to 
them which is why I kept getting the 'Could not find kernal image: 
noapic' message. 

I don't know if the problem will be solved in  6.10 or not but they said 
Ubuntu and Asus are working on this. They said this is a problem with 
all M2N socket motherboards. Would have been nice to know this before I 
took the computer home. I fault them for not being more forthcoming but 
maybe they didn't want to scare away a customer. I might have been able 
to solve the problem by ordering the non-graphic install disk from 
OSDisk.com which is where I buy all of my Linux CDs.  Being on dialup is 
just to slow (21 MB/hr) to download a complete iso.

Anyway, thanks again,

Jack Hoke

You will also discover that the greater Portland area is divided into 
six quadrants: N, NE, NW, SW, SE, and S. Somebody else chose to call 
them quadrants -- probably one of the folks who thinks there are three 
kinds of people in the world: those who can count and those who can't.

The East and West are divided by the Willamette River. North and South 
are divided by Burnside Street. The North and South designations are a 
bit fuzzier. South starts south of the Clackamas River. North is west of 
N. Williams Ave., and north of the Steel Bridge. In spite of all that, 
or perhaps because of it, finding your way around isn't too hard.

Walk to NW Lovejoy (the streets in that neighborhood are named with 
initials for each letter of the alphabet, so going north you've got 
Glisan -> Hoyt -> Irving -> Johnson -> Kearney -> Lovejoy) and get on the 
streetcar.  That will take you straight to the PLUG meeting.

Huh?!?  Who ever refers to "South Portland"?!?

There are five quadrants and that makes sense because the city is divided 
by the river east from west and Burnside north from south.  The river then 
curves west and so the NE quadrant's zero divider runs due(ish) north 
while the NW designation is picked up only on the west side of the river. 
Hence, there is a North Portland (which, historically, was a separate city 
pre-1890).

> The East and West are divided by the Willamette River. North and South

Huh (again)?!?  If you're south of the Clackamas, then you're also east of 
the Willamette.  So that's SE Portland.  Once you're outside the city 
limits, nobody cares.

The streets are labelled to designate which of the five quadrants they 
occupy.

So what streets are labelled "S Somethingorother" and are within the city?

> North is west of N. Williams Ave., and north of the Steel Bridge.

Williams doesn't exist south of there because that's where the river bends 
West.  So, west of N Williams is de facto north of the Steel Bridge.

Note that the only street that is labelled W or E without a north or south 
designation is Burnside, the north/south divider.

Welcome Skip,

    Hope you can tell, PLUG is alive and well.

    We meet on the first Thursday of the month at 7:00 PM at 
Portland State University in Smith Memorial Center, Room 294.
I'm still trying to line up the speaker for November.
If it works out it will be someone from Symantec.

    We also have hands-on clinics every third Sunday of every month
from 1-5 pm at Free Geek Community Technology Center, 1731 SE 10th Avenue.
And we have Advanced Topics Talks every third Monday at 7:00pm at
Jax (826 SW 2nd Ave).  And finally there are lots of other closely
associated groups in Portland like Biznix, Personal Telco, PASA,
Perl Mongers, the Python and Ruby groups, a Postgres group, and 
so on.

    Welcome to Portland.

    Also, you will have to let us know what is happening in
Montana.  I got a degree from the University of Montana 
in Missoula once upon a time - long, long ago.

                                          Sincerely,
                                          David Mandel

We are quite active.  You can look at the website for time and place,
www.pdxlinux,org.

We typically have 30-50 at the general meeting, 20 at advanced topics,
and 12 or so at the Linux Clinic.  There are also meetings for Perl,
Ruby, Plone, Open Source Entrepreneurs, Personal Telco (community 
wifi) and lunch meetings at the Open Technology Business Center. 
Occasionally special events at Portland State University or elsewhere; 
we've recently had Richard Stallman, Jeff Waugh and Mark Shuttleworth,
and we will have Cory Doctorow on 11/16 .   Plan on being immersed in
Penguin Luv.

Unfortunately, there is no Glisan street in southeast.

2104 *North West* Glisan is in the neighborhood sometimes called
Nob Hill and more often just the Northwest, close to the Cinema
21 theater.  However, I think that location is a one story shop
building, with a pharmacy at 2100 NW Glisan if I recall.  Perhaps
there are upstairs apartments that I haven't seen.  There is also

I am guessing that you are talking 2014 Glisan, the Biltmore
Apartments.  You will be near two busy streets and a couple of
busy taverns, so I hope a Montana boy can get used to the city
noises!  The park across the street from 2104 is nice on a summer
day, and there is a free wifi node nearby, but there are sometimes
evil doings there at night.  

And remember, no discharging of firearms in the city, unless you
are a police officer and the suspect is unarmed :-/

Yes, I got the address, section of the city... just about everything a
bit off. It is the Biltmore. I'll be moving in weekend of November 11th,
but I'll be up next Thursday to start getting things rolling.

Montana boy? No, this has been like being exhiled to Siberia for me.
I've spent the last ten years prior to Montana in NYC and SF. How'd I
end up here? Extended sabbatical.

Looking forward to PLUG meetings! Sounds like a good group!

Message-ID: <ff01ea180610192031t11907561hb8be98b6a3a3d3d2@mail.gmail.com>

  The Flash Player 9 Beta is available for download.  It seems to work
fine on my FC5 system with Firefox version 1.5.0.6.  It's worked with
all the web sites I had tagged as Flash 9 only.

Flash Player 9 Update
http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer9/

  I just downloaded the "Installer for Linux" version and unarchived
the file.  There isn't any installation program.  Just move
"libflashplayer.so" into the "/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins" directory,
chmod 755 the file, and then restart Firefox.

You've missed a significant word in my statement: greater. I never said 
that there was a South Portland, or that there were streets named S. 
something in the city of Portland. For confirmation of my description, 
have a look at The Thomas Guide or GoogleMaps.

The "great renaming" (I don't recall when it happened, or if it was 
really called the "great renaming") involved the cooperation of most of 
the communities that make up the metropolitan Portland area (in Oregon), 
which includes parts of Washington and Clackamas counties in addition to 
Multnomah. The cooperation got a little fuzzy in Gresham. They kept 
their name and numbering system, as did Oregon City. But the counties 
around them switched. I live outside Oregon City, and have a S. street 
name. SE 242nd Ave changes its name to SE Hogan Road when it crosses the 
county line, and enters Gresham, changes to NE Hogan Drive when it 
crosses Powell, and then becomes NE 242nd Dr when it crosses Stark.

(Note to Skip: As you can see, we sometimes get carried away with off 
topic stuff.)

I live on SW 139th in Beaverton, which is 139 blocks from the Willamette 
river... :)

Near me is the intersection of SW 139th Ave and SW 6th St.

And my address is neither in the 13900s, or in the 3 digit range.

  It looks like it's known bug.  You need to delete *all* the symbolic
links to the Flash 7 player.  Having both versions of the plug-ins
installed causes bad things to happen.

  Enter, "about:plugins" into Firefox.  Remove the symbolic links
until you don't see Flash installed.  I found extra symbolic links in
"/usr/lib/firefox-1.5.0.6/plugins/" and "~/.mozilla/plugins/".

  It seems to be working OK since I removed all the links to the older
version of the plugin.

Works great on Dapper too.  Just put "libflashplayer.so" in 
"/usr/lib/flashplugin-nonfree"  as Steve says "chmod 755 the file, and 
then restart Firefox".  Finally transformersmovie.com bliss!

Subject: [PLUG] PLUG and BSD?
Message-ID: <45391FBF.3010101@bigskypenguin.com>

Hey all,

I get the impression from looking over the web 
site that PLUG also has members up on or 
interested in the BSD troika, and other *nix 
flavors as well?

That would be great in my book, since we use both 
Penguins and Devils around here.

The small PHP/MySQL shop we will be moving to 
Portland in a couple of weeks uses Debian Sarge 
running Fluxbox WM for workstations, but I've been 
using FreeBSD on servers for years and have 
carried that on through, even though I have no 
complaints whatsoever about Linux servers.

Just figured I could keep up on BSD too, and we're 
currently migrating our two 1U MBX jobbies to 
FreeBSD 6.1.

Workstation-wise, we also keep a Windows machine 
on the network, mostly for checking PHP apps out 
on IE, but I've not installed Samba or anything 
that allows it to mount the servers, just thinking 
if it's all loaded up with viruses maybe that will 
slow them down a bit from spreading around.

To paraphrase Bart Simpson, "Why would anyone want 
to touch a Windows box? Everybody knows that's 
where cooties come from!"

(Cite the original Bart quote and I'll buy you a 
beer when I get to Portland.)

PS. Just in case I've already annoyed some Windows 
users, no harm meant. I know it has its place. I 
was just joshing.

You won't offend any windows users on this list. In fact I think you'd be
hard pressed to _find_ many day to day windows users here heh. There is a
BSD group as well but they're a small bunch and not nearly as well organized
as the linux folken.

Yes, PLUG doesn't restrict itself to Linux and never ever has.
Indeed, a number of years ago we changed our name from
          The Portland Linux Users Group (abbreviated PLUG)
       to
          The Portland Linux/Unix Group (still abbreviated PLUG)

Basically, we are simply a group of people interested in OpenSource
software.  This includes Linux and the open BSDs; but also includes
open like systems (proprietary Unix) and OpenSource applications
on proprietary OSs.  We are even interested in open stuff on
Windows.  One of these days I want to have Microsoft speak about
it's move toward open systems.  (Is it real or is it marketing?) 

                                          Sincerely,
                                          David Mandel

Look at http://www.codeplex.com for Microsoft opensource community info.
I don't think it's unreasonable to expect to get some Microsoft person

At the risk of oversimplification, PLUG members

* know and love Linux
* know and love core Free software (GNU utils, LAMP stack, ...)
* are aware of and respect the BSDs
* tolerate Windows as a necessary evil

BSD-esque questions are treated as first-class citizens, but I'm not 
sure this is the forum to which I'd turn for widespread, hard-core BSD 
knowledge.

Back in the 90s, however, we had a discussion that led us to expand 
the PLUG acronym as "Portland Linux/UNIX Group" (contra "Portland 
Linux Users Group").

Of course, the usual blithe quote around here is, "If you say you're a 
PLUG member, you *are* a PLUG member." I guess the first corollary is 
"If you say PLUG is concerned about BSD, it *is* concerned about BSD."

Windows users are way more annoyed with the OS than they'll ever be 
with comments like that. :-)

I'm on a BSD list for that, albeit a rather 
dormant one. My main motivation was curiosity more 
than anything else, but if I could find some 
fellow BSD users when I get there that would be 
helpful.

Sorry about that.

That's true.  In my case, I'm merely interested, not actually
experienced in *BSD.  I have never typed "make world".  I keep meaning
to muck around with installing and configuring a few variants.

That and building an eCos system are on my ever-expanding to-do list.

I'm not a professional sys admin by any stretch. 
I've been a developer for 20+ years. Grew up on 
C/C++ in industrial apps, so the OS was Unix or 
*nix flavored. Then telecom where HP-UX was pretty 
ubiquitous.

But I've always been around the servers in the 
smaller shops, so as I moved out on my own 
recently I was more comfortable having servers at 
my own site where I could get at the console than 
who knows where at some hosting facility. I know, 
old school, but I like saying things like "Why 
back in my day, by cracky...!"

Also, as an educational experience I find being 
able to get my hands on them beneficial.

So in our shop here we keep our own servers for 
development, and I maintain them, but occasionally 
go for outside help if the need arises (which is 
less and less).

BSD's ports collection is pretty easy to build 
stuff with, and I've had good success with FreeBSD 
as servers, so I don't plan on changing that any 
time in the foreseeable future.

Love Linux for workstations though. Plenty of good 
applications and 'apt-get install' is a breeze. We 
tried Kubuntu, bit I'm partial to light WMs, so 
Fluxbox got the nod.

One of my pet projects I'd like to get going when 
I get to Portland is to try to set up workstations 
to run as thin clients, booting from a server, 
etc, and all that stuff. No real strong reason to 
do it other than to see how it's done, how it 
work, etc.

   Look at the Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP). It's in use in the
education environment around the state. I _think_ there's a link to the K12
linux project on the PLUG web page ... yes, it's at the right end of the
menu along the top, just under the banner.

Ubuntu has an LTSP-based variant called Edubuntu.  Quite nice, I understand.

While cleaning out old cupboards and such, I ran across a 15-year-old
Hardcard, an add-on disk for early PCs that fit into an ISA slot.  It
is still in its original box and is complete with manual and floppies
(5-1/4" floppies).  It is the "Plus Hardcard II XL 105" meaning it adds
a whopping 105MB to your PC.  I suspect it is an MSM disk.

Does anybody here have an interest in such a historical oddity?  If
so, let me know and I'll see about getting it to you.  Otherwise, it
will get trashed.

Before you trash that, let me talk to a guy at work who collects ancient

I'll take it.  I've got one that still works in an old AT&T PC6300.
Well, where "still works" meaning that you have to drop the case about
six inches onto a hard surface to break the stiction and allow it to
spin up.

No rush.  I am not in a hurry to trash it.  Lord knows I've kept it

I concede to the gentleman who actually owns a "working" one of these.

Subject: [PLUG] thunderbird sending plaintext passwords when talking to
	dovecot
Message-ID: <20061021033624.5C9DD8F00@tinman.seitzassoc.com>


I'm seeing a problem where thunderbird sends passwords in the clear
while talking to a dovecot imap server.  Thunderbird is configured to
use imap without SSL, TLS, or secure authentication.  This was done
intentionally just as a test.  Dovecot is configured to disallow
plaintext authentication.  I was expecting thunderbird to not even
attempt to login, but it does anyway.  Is this normal?


Dovecot sends the following in response to thunderbird's capability
request.

  * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 SORT THREAD=REFERENCES MULTIAPPEND UNSELECT IDLE CHILDREN LISTEXT LIST-SUBSCRIBED NAMESPACE STARTTLS LOGINDISABLED\r\n

Since it says LOGINDISABLED, I expected thunderbird to just give up, but
instead it prompts for a password anyway.  After entering a password and
hitting return, I see the username and password in the clear on the
wire.

  2 login "user" "notapassword"\r\n

Thunderbird then pops up an alert message from dovecot.

  * BAD [ALERT] Plaintext authentication is disabled, but your client sent password in plaintext anyway.If anyone was listening, the password was exposed.\r\n


Dovecot is dovecot-0.99.11-4.EL4 running on Centos 4.3.
Thunderbird is thunderbird-1.0.8-1.1.fc4 running on Fedora 4.

My goal is to use imap when connecting via localhost and imaps for
everything else.  I suppose I can block imap using iptables or possibly
tcpwrappers, but I didn't think that would be necessary.

Here's one solution to throw into the bucket: stunnel.  With vm for
emacs, for example, using an external SSL wrapper is the easy (or only)
way to encrypt those pesky packets.  A .vm config file might start like
this:

(setq vm-stunnel-program "/usr/sbin/stunnel")
(setq vm-imap-server-list `("imap-ssl:mail.pippiandcarlos.com:993:INBOX:login:ME:PASS"
                             "imap-ssl:mail.wrlug.org:993:INBOX:login:ME at wrlug.org:PASS"
                             "imap-ssl:mail.viralvideo.ws:993:INBOX:login:ME at viralvideo.ws:PASS"))

Sorry I have no Thunderbird-specific tips.  Also, this does not further
your goal of allowing non-encrypted local traffic.

Try cupsdoprint to print from a client to a remote CUPS server.  My
command looks like this:

cupsdoprint -H ns.pippiandcarlos.com:631 -P HPDeskJet812C <filename>.ps

where ns.pippiandcarlos.com is the machine where my cups server is
running (and the printer is attached), and HPDeskjet12C is the name of
my printer as I named it in the CUPS server config.

Anything interesting at http://localhost:631/jobs ?

CUPS uses Apache-style ACLs (i.e. <Location /> \n Order Deny,Allow \n
Deny from All \n Allow from localhost \n </Location>) and allows most
things only for localhost out of the box, so you might want to check
/etc/cups/cupsd.conf

Tailing /var/log/cups/* can be informative, possibly more so after
setting "LogLevel debug" in cupsd.conf.

imaps works fine, that's what I'll use.  I was just surprised to see
thunderbird making a plaintext login attempt when the imap server said
they were disabled.

What do your logfiles (/var/log/cups) say? The default loglevel is info, so 
you might need to kick it up to debug to get useful information (cupsd.conf). 
Clear your print queue with lprm, restart cups, and try it again.

It could be that network sharing is not enabled. This is a basic barebones 
cupsd.conf that should work:

LogLevel debug
Port 631
<Location />
Order Deny,Allow
Deny From All
Allow From 127.0.0.1
Allow From 192.168.1.*
</Location>
BrowseAddress 192.168.1.255

   I sent this yesterday to plug-devel but it never showed up. So, I'll put
it here.

   Anyone here conversant in python and willing to work an hour or two with
me over coffee on some coding issues?

   I've read several books and think that I understand both the OO concepts
and how python implements them, but I keep getting stuck on syntactical
issues. My experience in self-taught programming languages (Fortran and C)
has benefitted from having someone much more expert than I point out the
specific errors in my code and explaining how to do it correctly. I learn
much more quickly that way and can be productive instead of hunting down
errors when I'm not sure just why they're errors.

   Urban Grind on NE Couch would be a central location, and I'll have the
code on my notebook.

OK.  How do I get it to you?  I am somewhat housebound with a
bedbound wife, but I could ship it.  I don't often get into Portland,
but that is a possibility with a little planning.

I kept a Central Point Copy Option board out of the huge pile of stuff I
have to Free Geek in the last move.  Better than seeing it junked.

Maybe one of these days I will get it working under Linux.  (Like I have the

Subject: [PLUG] SuSE 10.1 Install Experiences
Message-ID: <453A80DF.2020103@comcast.net>

Over the last month or so, I've been setting up a new (to me) machine
built of parts from multiple sources. Many of you helped me through a
number of problems. As it turns out, it appears that all of those
problems are related to marginal CD/DVD drives.

During the 'overheating' episode, I assumed overheating was the problem
because of the beep codes I was getting. Switching to a different mother
board seemed to make the alarm go away. Alas, it did not, and that was
when it became obvious that the CD/RW drive was the problem. Someone
suggested that it might be marginal, and recommended purchasing a new
DVD/RW drive from Pacific Solutions. That was where I bought the CD/RW
drive a few years ago. Some day I will probably get another one, but
maybe somewhere else this time.

The next time the problem came up was when I was trying to install
software on a VMware Win98 virtual machine. When I put the CD into the
drive to copy it to an ISO file, the alarm returned. I removed the CD/RW
drive and set the DVD reader to be the only drive on the second IDE
controller. The alarm went away.

For a variety of reasons, I decided to re-install SuSE 10.1. I
downloaded the DVD ISO, copied it to my XP laptop, and burned the DVD.
The install progressed to the point where it was trying to install
Firefox, and then died, claiming that the software was not present. From
this, and another experience related below, I'm assuming that the DVD
drive is also marginal. That one came from an old e-machines box I got
from my sister.

I reverted to a network install and carried on. During the install
configuration stage, a list is presented that describes what the
installation program will do. The proposed partition scheme is
described. Before I started the DVD install, I deleted all the
partitions on the 60GB drive, and when the proposed partitioning scheme
was listed I saw three partitions #1 for swap at about 1.5 GB, #2 for
root at about 20 GB, and #3 for home at about 35 GB. When I started the
network install, there were extended partitions (5 and 6, IIRC) with
sizes identical to #2 & #3, above. By editing the install configuration
I was able to tell it to use the whole drive, at which point it said
that it would delete the old ones and create 1, 2, and 3, as described
above. It probably didn't matter as far as day to day operation is
concerned, but now I understand it better.

Finally, I reinstalled VMware Server, this time from the RPM. It worked
fine, but now I have a problem getting ISOs for it to use. I copied the
Win98SE install CD to an ISO, but the winders install program thinks
there is dirt on the ISO. It's kind of hard to wipe off. I'll try
cleaning the CD and making a new ISO, but adding this experience to the
one with the DVD install of SuSE 10.1, I suspect that drive to be
marginal, too. I think I have another couple of CD drives laying around,
so I'll try swapping them in.

Meanwhile, I've successfully configured T-bird to use the profile file
I've been copying back and forth to whichever machine is working, and
I'm mostly back in business.

I need a microphone to record speech clips in Phonetics class. The
usual telephone quality microphones are not high enough quality, but I
don't need the kind of microphone they'd use to record a symphony.
Should be unidirectional and noise-cancelling. 

I bought one today at Radio Shack, but will have to take it back
because it doesn't put out enough juice to make a loud enough recording
on my Compaq R3240 notebook with Ubuntu amd-64 Dapper. I cranked all
the sliders to the max, but it was just not loud enough. For the
record, the specs on the Radio Shack microphone are:

	60-16KHz frequency response (a sheet inside 
		had a graph which was fairly flat) 
	Impedance 500 ohms + or - 30%
	Sensitivity -75 dB + or - 3 dB

Of course, I have no idea what the sound card in the computer is
expecting. I looked in Device Manager, but other than "NVidia nforce 3"
there is no mention of a manufacturer in any of the sound device
listings. Is there a command line I can use to figure out at least what
the device is? If I knew that maybe I could google and find out what
kind of microphone it is expecting.

I don't know much about laptop sound systems, but I wanted to point out 
a couple of potential problems.  1. Was the mic connected to the wrong 
input(line versus mic)?  2. Does your laptop even have a mic input?  If 
not, output level of a normal microphone is likely to be too low.

I have had good luck with most microphones on both Windows and Linux on 
my laptop. I'm guessing either you plugged it in the wrong port as 
suggested here, or your software is somehow misconfigured.

Some things to check:

1. Open a terminal in "root" mode and do "lspci". That will tell you 
what sort of sound card you have.

2. Make sure the module for that sound card is compiled and loaded. Do 
an "lsmod" to see if it's there.

3. Use the "alsamixer" console app. Make sure the little "M" is turned 
off on the microphone. The volume settings should be out of the red 
zone; I generally bring them up until they turn red, then down again. On 
my sound card that registers about 71.

4. Install a graphic recording package and use the VU meters in it to 
see if you're getting a signal. I've forgotten which ones are the best 
-- what little mike work I do these days is Skype with a gamers USB 
headset with built in mike and on Windows. :)

You might want to take a look at Varkon as well.

galen,

   I looked at -- and lightly used -- Varkon years ago. According to their
web page, it's not as good at CAD as it is with other tasks. Of course, it
may have changed since I last looked, so I'll look again.

Thanks,

Rich

It says:

Audio (rev a2)

Well, I already knew it was NVidia nforce 3 from the GUI Device
Manager, but neither Device Manager nor lspci tells me what the name of
the module is. Just "lsmod" gives me a long list, several of which
start with "snd-." But I don't think this is the problem -- the sound
*does* work. Playback is fine. It even records. It's just that the
microphones I have tried are apparently not putting out enough juice.

I opened alsamixer, but a lot of it is mysterious, and the man page
doesn't always help. The first problem is that I don't have any idea
what some of the controls are, that is, what they are supposed to do.
For example, the first item is Master and underneath it shows 100<>100,
and the color bar above is white, green and red, in approximately equal
proportions. The man page doesn't tell me what the function of master
is, or what the colors mean, or what the 100<>100 means. The next item
is Master Mono, which appears to be Off, but again, I have no idea how
it is different from Master, or even what Master does. Moving along,
Line Jack Sense appears to be Off also, but I remember turning it on in
the Gnome panel applet, and it definitely is on, that is, the speakers
do go silent when I plug in headphones.

But in spite of my kvetching above, alsamixer does seem to have done
something for me. Arrow-keying along the different controls I got to
Mic and Mic Boost. Mic was already set to 100<>100 (which I am guessing
means the max input from left and right channels), but Mic Boost was
"MM." I changed "MM" to "OO" and then tried the two microphones I have
(one crappy old ancient thing and one brand new high quality Radio
Shack one), and both now record at acceptable levels. Well, "almost
acceptable," because I still need the Mic setting in Audacity set to
the max. I worry that setting all these controls to the max is inducing
distortion. Plus, I had to hold the Radio Shack microphone right in
front of my mouth, which is not really suitable for recording a
linguistics informant.

As noted, I'm definitely getting a signal. Just not enough signal. And
Audacity does have VU meters, which are dancing back and forth as I
speak into the microphone. Plus, Audacity displays the waveform, which
also shows the sound level.

I think I am going to try a microphone designed for computers. After
googling a bit, the Labtec 524 sounds like a good one to try. I think
the Radio Shack microphone is designed for a PA system, which is
expecting a different level. Like I'm plugging a magnetic phono
cartridge into the Aux input on a stereo. I just wish I knew what the
microphone input on this computer was expecting so I could buy a
microphone matching those specs.

I have a wonderful Plantronics USB "Gamer Headset" -- I forget the model 
but I got it at CompUSA. You'll have to do some kernel-level juggling to 
get the devices right, but I think it would be a good one for this. But 
you're right -- get a microphone specifically designed for computers. 
Radio Shack should have them, and CompUSA has boatloads of them.

This may be an electrical, not a software problem.  Most laptop
microphone inputs to laptops are designed to work with "electret"
microphones - these mimic the old-style capacitance microphones,
and have an internal amplifier requiring power and produce far
more signal than an unamplified microphone does.  You can check
my hypothesis by plugging your soon-to-be-returned microphone
into another laptop, perhaps at Radio Shack.  

What to do?  Perhaps a microphone pre-amplifier before the signal
goes into the laptop - this allows you to use the best microphones.
Otherwise, look around (perhaps on the web) for microphones designed
to work with laptops.  I think, but I'm not sure, that microphones
designed for cassette recorders have similar behavior.  

There are people in PLUG that know a lot more about microphones
than I do.

I've renewed my subscription here after a long absence.

A friend of a friend wants to get up to speed on Linux relatively
quickly and asked me to tutor him.  I've used Linux for
several years (Red Hat, Mandrake/Mandriva, now (K)ubuntu) and can
do what he is asking.  I'm not sure what rate to charge, if any.  I've
tutored before in the public schools on a volunteer basis, but never
Linux, except on an informal basis.  The only references I have found
on the net with rates (one in Canada, one in NC) quote $15/hr as a
minimum.  Is that good? Bad? Indifferent?  Anybody doing anything
like this now?

I doubt that I know more about microphones than Keith, but I do know
that in addition to what he mentioned above, I have noticed the
built-in audio capabilities of several laptops I have owned have a
relatively high level of noise.  If you care dearly about the quality
of the recording, you might wish to use an external sound device, such
that the signal is converted to digital before getting anywhere near
you hard drive/processor/memory/whatever causes all that noise.

Free Geek offers basic classes for free to volunteers.

Otherwise, haven't seen it much.  Just work out what your free time is
worth, discount as you like, and quote him a rate.

A higher rate might encourage him to do more studying/hacking on his
own, which is a much better way to learn in my opinion.

I love you guys.

Give people a little taste of anarcho-communism and look how it grows!

Although I am working on a project that may lead to the port of
an industrial grade EE Cad program to Linux, right now some of
my Cad programs run under winders.  VMWare Player works,  sorta,
"security" dongles and all.

Yeah, it's what motiviates all of us.  Since we can't get enough we charge for
everything.

Once livelihood is covered everything else _can_ be given away.

Keith,

   My needs are for a generic 2D drafting program. I've established
communications with the PythonCAD author (and the mail list) and identified
three bugs when I asked why things weren't working as expected. So, while
it's still an application at early stages, I'm learning how to do the things
I need.

   The QCAD looked nice, but also didn't work as advertised and Yahoo! would
not let me sign up for their mail list. The confirmation messages never came
through. Oh, well.

Thanks,

Rich

Given that both Cadence and Mentor work under Linux, do you mean
industrial grade _and_ open source?

I have done a couple building drawings with Cycas.  http://www.cycas.de/
They have a free (beer) version for Linux. You can draw walls and get nice
3D renderings.  It has a good tutorial and is relatively easy to learn.

   Thanks for the insight, Bill. The advantage of a mature CAD system for
drawings like this is the ability to dimension lumber and have those
dimensions incorporated into calculations.

   PythonCAD is nice, but it's still young and needs a lot of ripening.

Sorry guys im kinda new to computers in general, and im gonna need some help

all wrong?

A: a single firewall running Fedora Core 5 that has multiple connections 
(DSL, Cable, FIOS, Satellite)

B: a hosted FC5 machine with lots of bandwidth and low latency.

C: the hosted machine configured with OpenVPN in server or server-bridge 
mode (more overhead for server-bridge mode?)

D: the Firewall needs multiple OpenVPN clients, each client connecting over 
one of my low cost internet connections.

E: Bond all the virtual adapters together at each endpoint and have my 
hosted machine act as a gateway/proxy

F: The firewall needs to support some sort of failover among the multiple 
connections

G: local traffic will go over the internal network's regular gateway

Im trying to create a large WAN pipe to the internet, maybe i need to use 
multilink ppp as well?  Any help or advice is welcome

Subject: [PLUG] Sound in SuSE 10.1
Message-ID: <453D7097.4090602@comcast.net>

Sound in general works on my recent installation of SuSE 10.1. I get the
little melody when the system starts up. I've successfully installed
RealPlayer and can connect to and listen to KBPS (allclassical.org). I
can successfully record and playback using gramofile.

Other programs that should produce sound, don't. NoteEdit, a MIDI
sequencer that has a graphical input for writing music on a staff can
successfully generate .mid files, but doesn't produce a sound when I
click on the "play" icon. I can see the notes being played (the black
note change to red as the song progresses), but I don't hear anything.
I've tried various settings on KMix, but nothing changes for this
program -- it does correctly control the line input used by gramofile.
Amarok plays .wav files, and claims to play .mid files, but I get no
sound when it does.

I'm guessing there's some connection missing between MIDI files and the
sound code. Any recommendations on what to look for?

Unless you're exchanging it for something else, ridiculously low. You
might get some at Universities at that rate as a service to the students,
in exchange for volunteer work or something else. Otherwise, $15/hr is
someone who can tell you what the book says, but has never actually done
anything vaguely related.

Figure a decent system admin in a real position is going to be $20/hr
full-time, with benefits. The above situation is more like a contracting
situation, so more like $40/hr. *If* this is pay-only not a favor to a
friend. The other way would be a teacher in front of a class, in which
case the students might pay merely that amount.

These days, most sound cards aren't midi-capable.  You're expected to run
some software to convert the midi file into a wav file and push it out to the
sound card.

The most commonly used software is probably timidity.  See if you already
have it.  If you do, try 'timidity some.mid' to see if that works.  If
it does, then
you may be able to configure noteedit to use it to play the midis, or you might
be able to set up timidity as a demon.

If you don't already have timidity, then suse might well have an rpm for it.
If not, you can get the source at sourceforge.  (You may also need to find
some patches - They didn't used to be included in the source tarball.)

Richard,

You might want to look at conflicts between OSS and ALSA under SuSE.  I
run SuSE 10.0 and have seen som eissues getting sound working consistently
with my TV/Radio Card and playing MP3s.

I don't have more advice other than to see if both OSS (I think it's the
OSS - Open Sound System or something like that) and ALSA are conflicting
or causing problems with regards to the software playing the sound.

I've used command line tools like mpg123 (and mpg321) to help with some of
my troubleshooting.

I'm no expert, and others will no doubt have other opinions. I usually
go to http://www.pricewatch.com/ and look under Computers/Notebooks
to see waht the spread is. Low end w/winXP seems to be about $450-700, 
which gets you 2+GHz (single core), 512-1Gb mem, 60-250GB HD, nice 
graphics with dedicated memory, but no monitor. LCD monitors seem to be 
about $150-$250. There are also PCs with No OS, if you're looking for
something unspoiled on to which to install Linux. The CPUs are
comparable, but the mem/HD configurations tend to start out smaller.
On the upside, the prices start at about $200 (still no monitor). And 
there are outfits like System76 <http://system76.com/> that sell PCs 
with Linux installed.

This is just a starting point. Dual core/64bit architectures are taking
over, at least from the advertising standpoint, and there doesn't seem
to be much of a price hit, if any.

Good Luck.

I ran across this yesterday.  Seems like it would be pretty nice if they 
double the ram and HD, but then it might break $200.

Not an endorsement by any means.  I've never dealt with tiger before.

As for IBM, I have a PI 133 that's been happily humming along for about 
364 days now doing DNS and failover apache.  I guess their hardware is 
less flaky than typical desktops.

Message-ID: <453E66A2.3040509@bigskypenguin.com>

Hey all,

I have two workstations with basically identical 
installs of Debian Sarge and Fluxbox, and I've 
just installed Skype on both of them.

One is here at the office, the other at home. When 
I use the headset for Skype here in the office, 
all is well.

When I take the same headset home and use it 
there, the person on the other end of a Skype 
connection here's a reverb of their own voice 
going on so loudly it makes it unusable.

Any ideas what might be causing that? I know squat 
about sound card configuration, etc.

I did some Googling and found a post that says it 
is due to the mic picking up the person's voice, 
but it does not do it on the machine here at the 
office, even when I use the speakers to hear the 
callers voice.

It only does it on the machine at home and even 
with the same headset. Any advice would be greatly 
appreciated.

Hello,

 

I currently live in Bend and my fianc? and I are looking for a change of scenery.

 

I know this is the Portland lug but I'm sure most of you have spent time in both cities. 

Would you recommend Portland over Salem? 

 

Sorry for the Off-Topic post, but I am just curious.

It usually has to do with feedback. This can happen if the mic is too 
close to the speakers.

That's the foundational piece of information I didn't have.

More digging will be needed for setting up timidity to handle the MIDI
work of other programs, but...

YaST does have an rpm for timidity, and I successfully installed it.

The reference I found on the SuSE forums page:

http://nfs-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/doc/suse/suse9.2/suselinux-userguide_en/ch15s10.html

had a dead link, but Googling located another source:

http://alleg.sourceforge.net/digmid.html

The first link they provide downloads eawpats12.tar.bz2. This is not the
same file name as the on in the instructions (listed two links up), but
the content seems to be the same and, after taking that into account, I
successfully installed timidity and its patches.

I also successfully used timidity to play .mid files, and have it as the
default action when clicking on a .mid file in the Konqueror file browser.

That will be satisfactory for the time being. Later on, when time
permits, I'll look into setting up timidity as a daemon to handle the
MIDI needs of other programs.

Thanks very much for the needed insight.

The default player on my system is amaroK, which uses xine as it's
engine. It does not play MP3s and recommends using some other engine. On
the other hand, that's the only engine available in it's configuration
wizard.

I'll have to look into that further.

I use mpg123 on my trusty old 200 MHz machine running RH 7.0. I
downloaded and installed it on this machine. It works fine.

I suspect that my problem is that what I was trying to do required
further setup. I now have workable ways to play .mp3 and .mid files.
When I have more time I'll try to make things more transparent.

Thanks for the reminder to install mpg123!

My observation on this list and other places has lead me to believe that 
the 64-bit architectures aren't supported nearly as wonderfully (in, say, 
Debian) as the 32-bit.  Is that still the case?

Does the dual-core technology require anything of the software?  Does 
stuff compiled for SMP work on the dual-core CPUs seamlessly?

Haven't messed with debian since my switch to 64-bit.  In gentoo it was
shaky a year ago, but now it's gold.  WMA video will continue to be an
inconvenience until a 64-bit win32codecs (oxymoron?) becomes available.
For now, it's right-click, view source, find the video link, and launch
mplayer <link> in a shell.

Only if you run unfree/unclean software.

I have been running 64-bit Fedora since FC2 without major problems. 
Closed source codecs and apps are the only problem. (Flash, for example.)

And you can still run 32 bit apps under the 64-bit kernel.

No software changes that would not be required of an SMP app.

And you can run purely 32-bit on 64-bit-capable hardware, which is what
I've been doing on my work and home workstations.  (I'm too lazy right
now to spend the time figuring out what's required to get Flash, Java,

The premise that ordinary people will be put in an increasingly difficult
position over time if they want to compile their own Linux kernel 
from current vanilla sources, is that an ideal premise that most OSS folks 
want to see come true?  The comment, "if you don't know how to do something,
don't do it," isn't the most inviting attitude one can communicate.  
Fedora Core 5 is a mainstream disrtribution even if it's a more bleeding 
edge variant of Linux that is upstream from an enterprise distribution.

It's too expensive for me to buy enterprise Redhat and so far I've 
had bad luck trying to use a free enterprise variant.  It looks
like I need to pick a free enterprise Linux variant and move all
my servers to it.

There is nothing new on the 386 these days.  Up until Itanium came out, 
the PC's architecture was simply a superset of the 386's architecture.
I don't think that even Pentium architecture is something that students
are taught about in most computer architecture classes yet.  I've heard
that 386's are slow, why support them?  Well, what is wrong with 
reimplementing the 386 in a low power configuration for embedded 
tasks such as implementing a smart phone?  Some major complaints 
against the modern PC are: it is too loud, it runs really hot, it
consumes too much electricity, it is too patched and complex.  I 
see nothing wrong with a market that focuses on yesterdays hardware
unless that hardware becomes really rare.  There is more old hardware 
than there is new, especially with the rate at which Microsoft has been
demanding more processing power and memory to even install Windows.  I 
bet there is a larger market for an operating system that is current, 
patched, and will run on older equipment than there is for an OS that
requires the latest and greatest dual core system.

As far as companies focusing on rare hardware is concerned: 
http://www.cloud9tech.com/ 
is a good example.  What this company is not doing though is
providing itself a clear migration path when the last color 
computer disappears.  I don't see any attempt to clone it 
with a more powerful and featureful version or even produce
a machine that is 100% compatible using modern electronics.  

In the software arena, I think ReactOS is in trouble because
it focuses on supporting proprietary Windows software when it
could become a proving ground for popular new applications that 
vendors etc. aren't willing or able to write for Linux, open 
source or otherwise.  The level of proprietary software support 
ReactOS has achieved is minimal and unfortunately it isn't 
even stable yet.
http://www.reactos.org/

Concerning the premise that there aren't enough people to work on 
developing the most secure and most patched OS for yesterdays 
hardware, what are the limiting factors?  They're not: an 
inavailability of aging computer systems, a universal lack of 
interest in retro computing, total lack of interest in recycling 
old computers.  If yesterdays computer is one that was even bought
as recently as a year ago new, that means there are a ton of old 
computers around.

Geez, how is not putting my name on an email an insult to people's intellect?
Whining doesn't mean that my posts won't get past the moderator.  Interesting
that I should have to pay something to get something from Linux.  I am very
grateful to the many people who have contributed to OSS thinking their
contributions won't cost other people something.

Subject: [PLUG] Bash functions...
Message-ID: <1161394136.453977d86841e@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I am trying to write a bash script to break a postfix mail log down.
I want to seperate the greylist errors from the blacklist errors, etc.
and when I'm done build a useful web page to inform my users.

I'm at the beginning of a project to provide a way to allow users
to see who should be getting through my mail relays that isn't.  I am 
not really familiar with a method to make postfix more fine grained on 
whether an email server that exhibits problems should be blocked or not
directly, so I'm taking an establish a universal whitelist approach.  
First though, I want to get an informative web page up built on 
information culled from /var/log/maillog.

In bash if I make variable bar local to function foo, is bar global to any
function called from within foo?  Another approach is for me to use an array
to sort multiple strings such as "Service is unavailable;", but I want to
avoid that for now.  In C++ there is a concept called namespaces, but this 
is for object oriented programming.  Yes an array is a common solution
to store a collection of strings uniquely, but you have to know how many
strings you are going to need ahead of time and possibly how long they will
all be.  So far, I use these identifying strings with grep, tail, and head
to search for a particular class of errors and effectively sort it out from
everything else dumping it to a file.  If there is a syslog or postfix
configuration trick to cause my mail server to log in such a way that the
different types of errors are seperated...

Subject: [PLUG] The helo address...
Message-ID: <1161453635.453a6043e65a3@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

First off, why do simple mail transfer protocol based systems have this
helo address?  There is a sender address and a recipient address, that
seems to be enough to cover where a message is from and where it needs
to go.

I'm running into a common issue with some sites sending a helo that is
a fully-qualified hostname and others sending a helo that is at best:
some sort of text message, complete garbage, or a non resolvable
fully-qualified domain name.

My ISP Opus gets through okay with a valid hostname for a helo, but 
other sites don't use one.  Why use something else?  If sites
don't use somehing I can look up, aren't they inviting anyone on the
Internet to pretend they are them?  Makes me wonder if some junk 
email claiming to be from hotmail, etcetera, really isn't. 

With Postfix 2.1.1, is there a simple way to test the helo compliance
in a weighted fashion so that something else has to be wrong such as:
recipient is invalid, source is blacklisted, user not in relay recipient
table... before a message will get blocked?  Skipping all tests for 
sites that aren't set up correctly is not the most inviting solution.

ISP's seem to be willing to program exceptions for strange helo addresses,
but shouldn't they be cracking down?

Anyone know of a Slackware 10.1 friendly replacement for Xtuner 2.0?

Does slackware 10.1 not come with an xforms package standard?

I'm trying to run an old ISA Reveal RA300 FM radio card.

I tried to use dosemu to support the card, but this doesn't seem to 
work for an nfs mounted server.

I guess there is always the option of getting X going and running
vmware-player. 

The 2.0.37 kernel has been superceded for a very    long time.

literal).  That a host name resolves to an A RR is so fundamental that it's
included as part of the definition of host name.

It's actually the address literal part of that paragraph that is its
purpose.  Section 3.6 begins by saying

    Only resolvable, fully-qualified, domain names (FQDNs) are
    permitted when domain names are used in SMTP.
    
It then goes on to allow only two exceptions, address literals in EHLO names
and "postmaster" recipients with no domain name at all.

As in most RFCs, "domain name" means "name within a domain", not "name of a
domain", which is made evident in section 2.3.5:

    The domain name, as described in this document and in [22], is the
    entire, fully-qualified name (often referred to as an "FQDN").

("[22]" is STD 13 - RFCs 1034/1035, the DNS standard.)

That makes this worth quoting again:

    Only resolvable, fully-qualified, domain names (FQDNs) are
    permitted when domain names are used in SMTP.

Any domain-based name used in SMTP must be (forward) resolvable.

A client EHLO/HELO name that's the name of a domain - especially any
well-known domain - is itself a high-probability spam indicator, unless the
domain is hotmail.com.  Hotmail uses the name of their domain as the EHLO
name, in violation of RFC2821 (and earlier RFCs)."



Quoted by Michael C. Robinson
-----------------------------
 
Okay, why is someone upset with hotmail in this post???
What is the difference between EHLO and HELO???

I've run into some comments on google that attempting to 
check a helo address is an act of espionage.  Any thoughts?

Is it true that there is no RFC requirement for a HELO
address to be a standardized and useful piece of information?

I've seen "friend," among other things for helo addresses.  I
get "localhost" and "localhost.localdomain" a lot as well.

If what the helo is going to be is so ambiguous, why in postfix
is the standard anti spam approach to try and resolve it?

yes:

$ foo() { local bar; bar=1; echo $bar; baz; echo $bar; }
$ baz() { echo " $bar"; bar=2; echo " $bar"; }
$ foo
1

wrote that for just this type of thing - it's basically a full syslog replacement that 
can match regexes, spawn commands on certain log messages, does remote logging (so you 
can stack it on top of a normal syslogd too). I use it to block ssh login attempts 
instantly (okay, withing half a second or so) and even have it trigger on spam attempts 
from the postfix logs (are you faking your HELO? bye bye!): (example lard configuration 
snipplet)

command "/usr/sbin/block-ip-from"
     log mail.*
     match "Service unavailable; .* blocked using"
     match "Helo command rejected"
     match "Improper use of SMTP command pipelining"

etc :)

lets rephrase that then:

"if you don't know how to do something, please pick one of the following options:

(a) don't do it
(b) ask someone to help you
(c) learn how to do it"

better? :)

working with OSS I can tell you that I've never gotten past (a) with a lot of people, 
because (b) is often preceded by complaints and (c) is not an option: they just don't

of course, someone else must be inclined to help you in case you pick (b). They 
generally are in case you pay them to do it.

Everything comes at a price.

  I'm still having occasional trouble playing Flash 7 videos from
locations like YouTube.  The Flash progress bar plays for 2 secs and
then hangs.  I've been able to clear the problem by closing out
Firefox and trying the video again.  It's a bit of a pain.

  The problem has been reported on the Flash Beta Wiki.  It doesn't
look like there is a fix available.  The download file hasn't changed
versions yet.

Wrong sort of payment, but otherwise, yes. I'm a bit far away to do it
casually and I'd need to do a lot of organization.



The other method is on Debian, install the package "libgtk-2.0-doc", go
into /usr/share/doc/libgtk2.0-doc, and look at the files
"gtk-tutorial/book1.html" and "gtk/index.html". The first is a pretty
decent tutorial and a good starting place. The second is the raw
documentation that would traditionally of been in man pages.

Alternatively, look at the files "docs/tutorial/html/book1.html" and
"docs/reference/gtk/html/index.html" in the GTK tarball. I imagine most
distributions have a package that includes those, but I don't guarentee
the filesystem location on anything but Debian.

I was out at a lunch lecture at OTBC;  the subject was allegedly
"Making Money on Open Source".  The lawyer speaking actually spent
most of his time talking about how bad the GPL was.  One of his
points was that although the FSF makes about 30 out-of-court 
settlements a year, the GPL has only been tested once in court (it
won).  He thought that was insufficient testing.

I was pretty riled by this guy, so I spoke up with "Well, nuclear
weapons have only been tested on cities twice, but I wouldn't want
to be in the next city one goes off over!"

That brought down the house.  Feel free to use it elsewhere.

Good resource. Thanks for posting it.

This is the first Nvidia card I've had. I assumed it would handle 3D,
but when I tried to run the included game XMOTO (2D), I got an error
message (forgot what it was, but something about not having 3D
capability). Because of licensing issues, certain closed source drivers
are no longer included, and have to be installed separately. The
Using_10.1 page gives complete directions for installing "the famous
Nvidia-update". It's very straight forward, and the game now runs. (I
don't imagine I'll spend any time with the game, but it was useful to
test the capabilities of the driver.)

What was the delay?  I ran into a website claiming that FC6 has problems.
Can Fedora Core 6 support DVD playback out of the box?  Is the package
set any tighter than it was in Fedora Core 5?  Does Fedora Core 6 support
vmware?  The newest Fedora I've been able to run vmware on is FC3.

For Fedora Core 5, why is there a livna repository and why does it have to be
added to yum to enable DVD movie support?  Why is it you can buy a television
and dvd player to watch movies where the prices don't appear to be going up, 
but lately problems have arisen providing that functionality to Linux users on
their Fedora Core workstations?

It seems ridiculous for the owners of mp3 and various DVD codecs to essentially
crack down on individual people's ability to watch movies and listen to music
on their computer.  For some people, there is no room for a television and
dvd player.   I bet Vista will support movies, but with the bad experiences
I've had with XP I want nothing to do with Vista.

What does the 64 bit refer to?  Is it: the word size on these processors, 
the memory addressing space, a clever way to shove 2 32 bit processors 
into one package?  For all the recent duo core hype, is it really 
merited?  Sounds to me like problems from IA-32 architecture are still 
causing trouble for operators of the newer Itanium architecture systems, 
if that's what it's called.  I have an Alpha system.  A miserable 
experience, everywhere I went it was hard to get the right software 
for it.  To make it run again, I need to modify a new power supply for it.
  
Linux was lagging behind on Alpha and Microsoft abandoned both their 
Windows NT and their Windows 2000 port.  What will make or break 64 
bit computing?  Alpha got killed,  what makes Intel think that their 
64 bit offerings are going to live?  What makes AMD so confident?

The computer industry has pushed for speed, speed, and more speed.  Are
the current technologies being taken as far as they can go?  Hard drives
have grown in capacity impressively fast, yet lately their reliability
seems to be dropping.  Motherboard level: APM, plug and play, and ACPI 
implementations still seem to vary a great deal causing problems even 
in Windows.  Are features still designed for Windows by chipset and
processor manufacturers without any consideration of other OS'es.  Maybe 
our computers are getting fast enough, but what good is a race car without
tires?  What good is a duo core pentium system if the $10 power supply 
dies?  People say 64 bit computing is a reality, but then I see a long
discussion about problems running flash on these systems.

Reliability needs to catch up to speed increases.  Maybe skillful use of
pelsiar devices will allow the newest processors to operate fanless and
save on power consumption.  Nothing like losing a $3000 computer because
a $20 fan failed.

As I was writing that last post I was noticing that the text looked
fuzzier than before. I checked text in a number of other windows and
noticed the same thing. I decided to switch back to the previous
xorg.conf file and, sure enough, the text is now back to nice and crisp.

Glad I'm not into 3D games, because I won't be using the Nvidia-update
driver. And I'm VERY glad I saw that xorg.conf was backed up during the
Nvidia-update installation process. It only took me 5 minutes to figure
out where it was kept! Time stamps on the files told me which one was
which (there was another backup made a few minutes later by sax2).

Nvidia's download site has a special note for SuSE/OpenSuSE users that
states you are to download the shell script installer and use that.  You
would need to do that for every time the kernel gets updated.  I haven't
had any issues for years.

The first time I installed VMware Server I didn't do it from rpm; the

Thanks.

After some additional reading I discover that I didn't really need to
know that -- at least if I understand what I've been reading. It appears
that I'm supposed to install the guest OS first, and then install the
VMware Tools for that guest OS using a menu entry in the VMware Server
Console.

So, on to getting the guest OS installed.

Subject: [PLUG] Installing a Guest OS in VMware Server
Message-ID: <45411213.2080004@comcast.net>

Several attempts to install Win98SE as a guest OS in VMware Server have
all failed at the same point. After "power on" the virtual screen
reports that I have an invalid system disk.

I have replaced the CD drive several times (a CD/RW burner, a DVD drive,
and two other CD drives), and have tried copying the Win98SE CD to an
.iso file several times using the command:

dd if=/dev/hdc of=Win98SE.iso

The latest attempt was with the newest (to me) CD drive. Shortly before
the copy finished, the annoying alarm that I've been getting from time
to time, returned. The copy finished, and I power cycled the machine to
silence the alarm. I've repeated the process with two separate Win98SE CDs.

In each case, I've edited the virtual machine settings and, using the
browse button, selected the .iso file I just created.

What I can't tell is if I've got a whole house full of marginal drives,
or if there is something else I'm doing wrong.

Any ideas?

Dick,

   Are any of the drives marked "RMS?" If so, they'll accept only GNU/Linux
images and not Microsoft ones.

Indeed. This though is understandable given how copyright law has been
distorted recently. Why don't you talk to the legislaters instead of
complaining to this list? You could look up all the information on the
EFF's website if you really want.

Addressible memory is generally 2 to the power of the word size, 2^32 for
processors with 32-bit words, 2^64 on processors with 64-bit words. ia32
of course had the segment registers which messed this up, but in 32-bit
mode those were pretty well ignored. I guess you haven't heard all the
mentions, Alpha is dead and Itanic is pretty well DOA (Intel claims it is
still alive, but almost everyone agrees it looks pretty well like a
zombie on un-life support).

Generally they're always refering to the word size (since that is the
number that matters). The one field where the manufacturers tend to lie
was in the console market, the N64 didn't use a 64-bit word, it merely
had a 64-bit wide bus.

Do you really think Alpha, Itanic and ia32 are the only processors ever
made? There are plenty of other processors, such as 68K, ARM, MIPS,
PA-RISC, SPARC and PowerPC. Of those the last 4 all have 64-bit modes,
PA-RISC has been terminated by HP, SPARC looks like it will be slowly
dying off, while MIPS has been consigned to the embedded space (who don't
need 64-bit words *yet*), and with Apple gone PPC64 isn't on very many
machines. Nonetheless all four do have 64-bit modes/varients.

What will make 64-bit computing common is the 4GB barrier. 4GB is
2^32, once you've got 4GB of memory there isn't too much point of adding
more memory to a machine with 32-bit addressing. Even before then, a
fair slice of a process's address space tends to get grabbed by various
things being mapped in that aren't needed. Even at 2GB of memory address
starts becoming scarce. With normal consumer desktop systems heading
towards that, 64-bit is here to stay. Professional desktops of course are
already well past that point.

Intel has two 64-bit offerings. There is their implementation of amd64
(later P4s, and Core 2), and ia64 (Itanic). Their confidence in ia64 is
insanity, that is management trying not to admit defeat even when the
reality is they're DOA. Core 2 is a decent amd64 implementation, it is
faster than AMD's current generation (but that generation is now old) and
its power consumption isn't too awful. But, we've yet to see AMD's
answer, otherwise Core 2 is expected to be reasonably successful.

AMD of course produced the amd64 architecture. Their magic card was that
it was fully backwards compatible with ia32, as opposed to ia64 which
merely placed an ia32 core on the same die as the ia64. Since they've
only got one architecture to deal with, they don't have to waste as much
effort. Given how ia64 is DOA, and amd64 is now well established, AMD is
right to be confident in amd64. OTOH they're still behind Intel in
percentage of the market, but they've been making massive inroads.

Yeah, you get what you pay for. Cheap garbage is, well, cheap garbage.

Flash doesn't have a 64-bit version. Running an ia32 version of Flash
inside a browser that uses amd64, is a little interesting (though I'm
surprised no one has taken a serious whack at it yet).

Only problem is the peltier devices use a *lot* more power than a fan.
All of the current generation of processors have a shutdown on overheat,
so that isn't too big a deal (well, they shutdown, but they don't fry).

Rich got me on that one. I was on my way out the door and it didn't sink

Any thing's possible, but I doubt the disks are bad. One of them worked
just a couple of weeks ago -- I should have found a way to keep the .iso
files before reloading SuSE 10.1. I got the same error with the second
one, today.

The main thing that is different is that for the first installation, I
installed VMware Server from the tarball; this installation is the rpm
YaST has available. With the first one, I hadn't gotten to the part
where I could launch VMware as an ordinary user, but was running it as
root. With this one, the rpm sets all that up for me.

Is it possible that there are ownership issues with the .iso files? I
run dd as a normal user, so the ownership of Win98SE.iso is rsteff -
users, and the permissions are -rw-r--r--. Does VMware need something else?

I can guess, though I can't tell for sure without seeing your
Windows 98 install disk.  Win98SE CDs come in /at least/ two
flavors, and one flavor of CD is designed to install on a new
computer while another only contains the files suitable for
restoring to an already-configured computer.  You probably have
the second kind of less-useful CD.  In "Bill's World", installing
on a clean hard drive (or a clean VMware partition) constitutes a
new copy, and you are supposed to use a CD capable of that.  These
full installation CDs are more difficult to find at garage sales
and on Ebay than the more common re-install CDs, since in theory
the full install CDs are limited to the folks that build computers,
not the folks that merely buy complete computers.

The full install CD for Win98SE will say something like "For
distribution with a new PC only" on them.

And of course it would be wrong, very wrong, to violate the rules
of "Bill's World" and make copies of full installation CDs and
use those copies, even if it was technically possible, which no
loyal American would know about anyway.

The CDs I have been using are the first kind. They say "For distribution
with a new PC only..." Both of the PCs that they came with also came
with "Recovery" CDs, which when inserted into the CD drive at boot time
would cause the factory installation to be written to the hard drive.
This would include all the drivers as required for that particular
computer. I'm not trying to use the recovery CDs. Also, I did
successfully use one of these "distribution with a new PC" CDs in my
first, successful attempt to use VMware a couple of weeks ago, before I
re-installed SuSE 10.1.

Keith,

   That's an excellent point. A number of years ago I upgraded my VMware
guest OS from win95 to win98se on the advice of the VMware tech support
folks. I tried a Windows upgrade cdrom and it would not work. I had to pay
$100 _more_ to get the version with the floppy disk, and had to use the
floppy to allow the cd to be read. Highly annlying.

   Back then, I bought my box at Office Depot.

Subject: [PLUG] VMWare Player and Samba and caching
Message-ID: <20061027142430.GB25100@gate.kl-ic.com>


Since VMWare is a hot topic, I will ask a few questions I have
encountered so far.  Here's the first:

I have a copy [*1] of windows 98 SE running under VMWare under
Linux, connected through VMWare's Samba to my account on the
native Linux host "t30".  I can see the files in \\T30\keithl\
and copy them into Windoze.  The problem is, when I copy a file
from the host, change it, then copy it again, I get the old 
version.  It is behaving like the copy process is reading out 
of a cache somewhere.  The workaround is to make a renamed copy
on the host, copy into the guest,  and then rename the copy back
on the guest, but this is time consuming and error prone.  Not
to mention very lame.

Is this a problem with Windows 98?  Samba?  VMWare's version of
Samba?  Or am I being smitten by an angry God, disgusted with my
profane and unnatural descent into Microsoft Hell? :-)

Note, this is part of a project to port a Windows app to Linux,
so at some point I can ditch VMWare and return to blessed purity.
Thus I discount the smiting explanation,  God should favor the
recovery of a lost program into the blessed light of Linux!  :-)

Tee hees aside, have any of you seen this apparent caching problem
with VMWare, or can you suggest some alternate keywords besides
"caching" to Google the problem with?

Keith

Keith,

   Yes, to all of the above.

   How is your smb share configured? Is there a common directory readable and
writeable by both linux and win98?

   I have such a directory and have not had any problems in the almost 10 years
I've run win9x in VMware. Here's that share definition at the end of the
/etc/samba/smb.conf file:

; share name -- modified by RBS 2004-09-22
[winstuff]
    comment = Shared directory for group vmwin98
    path = /data2/winstuff
    writable = yes
    valid users  = @vmwin98
    locking = yes
    create mode = 0660
    directory mode = 0770

Subject: [PLUG] Free Fujitsu old-school tablets, Saturday 28 Oct downtown
Message-ID: <20061027024459.GS15237@ontology.tercent.com>

Hi folks,

What: ~ 10 Fujitsu tablet PCs in various states of repair.
    Proc: 486, I think.
    HDD: None, but accesses a PCMCIA HDD or flash card reader
    Batteries: Dead, but runs on 12 VDC (a few hacked adapters
    available)
When: Saturday, noon-3 PM or so
Where: Downtown (SW), near 12th and Morrison
Who: Randall, 617-905-7467 (cell)

A year or two ago, I picked up on a posting on PLUG about Free Geek
giving away some Fujitsu tablet computers.  I got a bunch with the
thinking that I might write some software for them (low-power routers,
survey tablets, email / VT100 screens for around the house, etc.).

Well, I never wrote the software and I'm too busy.  So, I'm giving them
back to the community.  Plus, I'll throw in a few 12 VDC transformers
from the el cheapo bin at the thriftshop, in case you don't have 12 VDC
at home, so you can power 'em up.

These boxes have something of a following on the net -- googling around
should yield some hobbyist / hacker pages.

If you want 'em, just give me a ring and I'll arrange to meet you
downtown by 12th and Morrison to give you the pick of the litter.
First come, first serve.

There were issues with a badly done patch that made test 3 uninstallable.
There were also a few other bugs that showed up last minute.

I have it running on my laptop.  Works fairly well so far.  Compiz is not
working right. Other than that, I have not seen anything fatal.


Can Fedora Core 6 support DVD playback out of the box?


Nope.  And it won't until they don't have to worry about the DVD Consortium
taking legal action against them.

But, as always, there are ways around that.

I had a back and forth conversation with someone on the VMware Forum
site. The recommendation was to install from the CD. Here's the
instructions:

With the virtual machine virtual CD-ROM drive configured to use the
physical CD, power on the VM and when you see the VMware Logo click the
mouse in the virtual machine window to get focus of the virtual machine
and press the "Esc" key. Select the CD-ROM as the first boot device.

This was a step I did not do before, the <ESC> and selection of the
CD-ROM. Following that procedure, I successfully installed the guest OS,
and then successfully installed the VMware Tools in the guest OS.

Subject: [PLUG] Annoying alarm -- embarrassing discovery
Message-ID: <4542E29E.8010505@comcast.net>

This probably belongs in the same category as "is the power cord plugged
in?" or similar user error stories.

During the installation of the guest OS in VMware, using the physical CD
drive, I got that annoying alarm I've been getting since I began
building this machine. I was sure the machine wasn't overheating, but I
decided to get down under the desk and double check. Sure enough, it was
not the machine. The embarrassing discovery was where the alarm was
actually coming from: the battery backup. This machine has a 450 watt
power supply. All the older ones had 300 watt or less. I have two
machines powered through this battery backup. Spinning up the CD drive
on the new machine was enough to overload the battery backup unit. I
shut down the other machine and the alarm shut off.

This means that there is probably nothing wrong with the first mother
board, or any of the CD drives. On the other hand, this one works, and
is fast enough for my current needs, so I'm leaving it alone.

So, the next time I am able to make it to the clinic, you'll recognize
me because of the paper bag I'll be wearing over my head. I suppose the
headless horseman costume I'm wearing to a party tomorrow night would
also be appropriate.

Also, for those that are interested, there is an issue with getting VMWare 
to install on Fedora Core 6.

There is a bug in the installer that installs the 586 kernel instead of 
the 686 kernel.  The fix is to install the 686 kernel and kernel-devel via 
yum.  Should fix the problem.

I know I've read on the PLUG website that ALL *NIX discussion is
welcome.  I cannot find the verbage right now, unfortunately, or I'd
paste it here.  Lots of the website content uses the word "Linux", but
one gets the feeling that this is a shorthand for "All *NIX".  The
members have put up with my open infatuation with gentoo, which leans in
the direction of BSD.  You're probably on firm ground.

As for your actual technical issue, I can be of no help whatsoever.
Sorry.

Subject: [PLUG] Hardware Question ( server video card )
Message-ID: <20061028214611.40343e89@badger.had1.or.comcast.net.>

I figure it's been a good long time since I've asked a stupid
question. There's a bunch of preamble here, if you want to see the
question, skip down about 5 paragraphs.

I'm minimally in charge of a set of servers. Some of them are very old
Pentium-4 class machines, and their motherboard has a lot of integrated
electronics, but this particular one has no video card. It has 3 pci
slots and one agp slot. 

It's a 2U chassis. Currently it's refusing to boot without a
video card. I can install one, but to do that I have to remove the
motherboard, brace it with non-conductive materials, insert agp
card (it's what I have handy), and leave everything connected to it.

This won't work in a server, and I can't leave my agp card in it. It
sticks up outside the box and it generally won't go into the
motherboard; it doesn't fit right; seems to be a little short
lengthwise, and some of the chassis openings for the bracket of the
card to connect to the monitor cables are in the wrong places. It has 3
vertical and one horizontal opening in the case; perhaps the horizontal
one would come off of a riser card of some sort?

I've tried all the things I can do to change the BIOS settings et
cetera, and I honestly can't make it come up without a video card.
Which is strange, because this is a relatively new problem- this system
booted fine without a card last month.

vvv===The question===vvv
If I go to order a video card for this box, what is it called?
Do I order a "low rise video card" like the video cards on this page ?
http://www.directron.com/lowprofile.html

As a side note; if I have other cards I need for similar boxes, am I
just looking at ordering 'low profile' cards?

Look at your COM port settings and see if you can find console redirect, 
or something to that effect.  Enable it to see if that makes a difference.

This is what I started thinking you needed before I read to much.

What I'm confused about is you saying your AGP card is a little short. 
The physical slot and position of the slot is no different than on a 
normal desktop board.  It's nothing special outside of the low profile 
backplane to fit the chassis.

It may be aresult of my jamming the agp card into the slot without
taking the motherboard out of the chassis; because of the shape of
the chassis and the height of the card, I would have to maul the agp
card to fit right.

Never mind I just had to run dpkg-reconfigure postfix. Apparently I
missed the question when I installed 6.10. I know worse then a windoze

Subject: [PLUG] Need help booting M0n0wall (FreeBSD) using Grub
Message-ID: <20061029155529.Z25765@eehouse.org>

This weekend's project is a WRAP box I use as a home firewall/router.

For storage I have a 1G (Sandisk) CF card with GRUB on the MBR.  There
are three extended partitions, formatted ext2, with Grub's files in
one and a couple of LEAF releases in the others.  Everything works
that far: on boot I see the Grub menu over the serial console and can
boot either of the LEAF releases.  Here's how LEAF's fdisk sees the
card:

Command (m for help): p

Disk /dev/hda: 1024 MB, 1024966656 bytes
32 heads, 63 sectors/track, 993 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 2016 * 512 = 1032192 bytes

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1               1         125      125968+  a5  FreeBSD
/dev/hda2             126         250      126000   a5  FreeBSD
/dev/hda3             251         375      126000   a5  FreeBSD
/dev/hda4             376         993      622944    5  Extended
/dev/hda5             376         377        1984+  83  Linux
/dev/hda6             378         382        5008+  83  Linux
/dev/hda7             383         387        5008+  83  Linux

I got the card (1G Sandisk CF and SD cards are $20 at Staples this
week, BTW :-) and set aside the larger primary partitions in order to
play with M0n0wall, a FreeBSD-based firewall/router distribution.  But
I can't get Grub to boot M0n0wall.

I downloaded a monowall image, and wrote it to an old but proven 8M
card (in a USB reader) just to confirm that it works:

# dd if=/tmp/wrap-1.22.img of=/dev/sda

Here's what my desktop's fdisk says about that card after dd finishes:

Command (m for help): p

Disk /dev/sda: 8 MB, 8028160 bytes
256 heads, 63 sectors/track, 0 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16128 * 512 = 8257536 bytes

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda4   *           1           4       25000   a5  FreeBSD
Partition 4 has different physical/logical endings:
     phys=(1023, 255, 63) logical=(3, 25, 41)

I can boot my WRAP box off of this card, and it takes me into the
M0n0wall setup process, so I think the image is good.

But if I then write the image to the 1G card grub can't handle it.
I've tried writing the original image (the same I dd'd to /dev/sda) to
/dev/sda3, which I think was wrong since that image is an entire disk.
But I've also dd'd /dev/sda4 from the working M0n0wall 8M disk and
written that to /dev/sda3 of the 1G disk.  In either case grub can't
boot, and the failures look the same:

root (hd0,2)
 Filesystem type unknown, partition type 0xa5
makeactive
chainloader +1

Not ufs
Not ufs
No /boot/loader
 
>> FreeBSD/i386 BOOT
Default: 0:ad(0,a)/kernel
boot: 
Not ufs
No /kernel
 
>> FreeBSD/i386 BOOT
Default: 0:ad(0,a)/kernel
boot: 

I got my Grub off my desktop, which is current Debian "testing".  It
doesn't seem to include support for ufs.  But what I've read about
booting FreeBSD suggests that at least the chainloader method should
work, yet it doesn't.  I downloaded grub 0.97 sources (apt-get source
is broken for me for some reason, so I went to gnu.org) and built with
ufs support, but it wasn't clear to me how to install onto the CF
card, so I haven't tried that yet.  I did copy the ufs2_stage1_5 file
over, and ran grub's setup command on the WRAP box, but that didn't
help.

All of the instructions I've seen for dual-booting FreeBSD with Grub
assume you're doing a normal install onto a disk, then setting up
Grub.  I'm working with an image, and suspect that's part of the
problem.

Can anybody suggest a next step?

Thanks!

Russ,

   Allow me to ask the obvious question: since the system board has an AGP
slot, have you contacted the system manufacturer/vendor to ask what video
cards they intended when they chose that component? I assume they're still
in business.

Subject: [PLUG] weather monitoring station gear?
Message-ID: <868xiy7qdv.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I am about to mount some wifi gear on my roof, which is something of
an operation due to the pitch of the roof and my wobbly knees.
However, I've arranged for some scaffolding, which will help get me up
there, on a short-term basis.  

It was suggested that I might mount some weather gear at the same time
(anemometer, insolation, air temp sort of stuff) something that I
could monitor/record from a linux box.  Anybody done this before, have
any advice?

To be perfectly frank, Rich; I believe this particular unit was bought
from a clearing house of dot-com failures, and this motherboard doesn't
exactly match the scratched up, coverless, over-labelled (six different
companies/owners have labelled this unit) chassis. The motherboard does
sit close  enough that the connections (com1/2, usb, eth0, parallel,
game port and ps2 ports ) all stick out "right" but through an
unmodified rectangular outlet.

It looks *sarcasm* extremely professional */sarcasm* but it does work,
or at the least it needs some sort of (AGP or PCI) video card.

I googled for agp riser card and got some hits that look apropos. No
idea if they'd actually line up right for you, given what you've said.

Otherwise, low-profile is the way to go. I've seen NICs with alternate
low-profile mounting bracket.

   Oh. Well, does the motherboard have a visible name that connects to a
company still in business?

   From your description, the entire setup may be old enough that a new
replacement -- with serial console access -- could be the least expensive
option, and easily justified against your time and efforts.

Message-ID: <45462834.6040505@openboxbuilder.com>

Can anyone recommend a Linux-friendly computer store near Vancouver that 
has good support?

A friend is about to buy her first computer and is willing to try Linux. 
  She has used a computer at work, but is not computer savvy by any 
means, so she needs to be able to take her computer in if there is a 
problem.  I would prefer a store that won't try to switch her to 
Windows, since she will probably buy whatever they suggest.

I appreciate any suggestions you can make.

Message-ID: <8fcf3b560610301043t5cf8e0b2k31a4e1f67a5801f9@mail.gmail.com>

I was playing around with an old laptop this weekend and got to wondering
something.  Is there any way to use VNC to sort of simulate a dual-head
setup, even though I only have a single-head graphics card?  My desktop has
a Matrox Millineum G400 single-head graphics card, but I was wondering if I
could create 2 Screens in xorg - one of which is just there for a VNC
connection.  Then I could setup my old beater laptop as a view-only client
to that screen and essentially have a dual-head setup for my desktop.  I
google'd around a bit and didn't have much luch so was wondering if anyone
on this list had any ideas.

I have a drive with an orphaned LVM partition. The LVM config and backup
were on a separate drive that failed. I don't have LVM metadata backups
because I only back up /home, not /etc. Which with LVM is not very smart-
recovery is easy as long as you keep copies of /etc/lvm/backup/
:(

How can I recover the orphaned partition? All brilliant ideas welcome.

You can try a vgscan which should scan the disk for LVM data. You might need
to do a vgimport after that if it shows up as exported when you do a
vgdisplay plus a vgchange -a y if its showing as inactive.

   My experiences with ENU on NE 122nd Ave. have consistently been positive.
That's more than I can write about any other retailer in the area.

Well, you'll probably also need port 6000 (x11) and perhaps 7100 
(xfs).

The other thing is that most X configurations these days don't open 
themselves to remote access. You'll have to tweak things a bit. If 
you're using GNOME, you'll want to start in /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf. 
Look for the [xdmcp] section. (If you're using a more generic X login 
manager, look in /etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess.)

Paul,

No joy.  XDMCP still only operates if the firewall is down.

Thanks for letting me know about ports 6000 (x11) and perhaps 7100 (xfs).
 
I have made changes in the following:
	/etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess
	/etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config
	/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.config 	[fc5: /etc/gdm/gdm.config via

I just thought to look at it under Ethereal...

The response from port 177 is:
 Internet Control Message Protocol

This in spite of having used system-config-securitylevel to open port 177.

Did you open up port 177 for all IP protocols or just TCP? You need to 
open it to UDP for XDMCP to work.

from Jax or Free Geek or PSU or Lucky Lab).  :-/

Opinions?

Subject: [PLUG] /bin/loadkeys Runs Only As Root
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0610310859410.18434@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   For a reason I don't understand, when I boot my notebook and log in as a
user, ~/.keymap is not successfully read by /bin/loadkeys. The perms are
755, and it used to work fine. Now, the only way I can invoke the changes is
as root.

   Does anyone have any ideas what might have happened, and how I fix it?

      you know they have a lot of cool projects going on.
      The Open Source Lab at OSU is nationally recognized and is
      home to a number of major Open Source projects.  The 
      Open Source Education Lab and the Oregon State Linux Users Group
      are also neat and provide ways of getting undergraduates 
      involved with OpenSource software.

Stupid and obvious suggestions/questions category: Does /bin/loadkeys 
work if you
rename the file and run it manually from the command line? Are there any
error messages produced if you run /bin/loadkeys on ~/.keymap from
the command line? Is ~ expanding to what it should?

   755

   rwxr-xr-x

   It's owned by root.bin.

tony,

   If run as a user, then there are permission errors. If run by root, no
problem.

   However, /bin/loadkeys is world executable and that's why I don't
understand the errors and lost ability to properly run.

Rich,

I don't know whether or not this helps. I'm running Mandriva 2006 at the 
moment
(haven't looked on my Ubuntu laptop yet). The* loadkeys* man page here says
anyone having access to /dev/console can load keymaps. On this system,
/dev/console shows
*crw------- 1 tonyr root 5, 1 Oct 31 08:08 /dev/console
*(owned by me). It's something to look at.

So the ~/.keymap is owned by root? Try chown <youruser>.users ~/.keymap and
then re-run loadkeys [filename ie ~/.keymap]

I think Rich is using Slackware. Here's the bone stock defaults I have
running Slackware 11.0

You *sure* it doesn't have onboard video, that's just been temporarily
disabled or permanently fried?  Most PC systems give an 8-beep code and
many won't boot w/o video.

I'd recommend you hit the Free Geek thriftstore for (a) another 2U box,
(b) a replacement mobo, or (c) a short PCI or AGP video card.  You can
just leave the bracket off if it's too tall.  And they might have a
low-profile card floating around, or in the "untested" pile in the back
corner.

Ah ok gotcha .. yea thats pretty funky then. Did you  drop down to single
user to do the upgrade? I read in the readme/ugprade.txt for the first time
that you _had_ to be in single user to do the package upgrades, something to
do with glibc, and I bet that could be causing part of your problem. As far
as the modules go, you should be able to install the default 2.4.x module
package along with the other 3 kernel packages (kernel-ide, source and I
can't recall the other off the top of my  head).

Complete shot in the dark but maybe its udev related? You're booting
2.6.xif I read your response right, try doing the module install,
updating lilo
with the 2.4 image as default and booting into that and see if the
permission issue happens again.

I'm not entirely sure that Pat will help you un-fsck the situation but its
worth a shot or you might try alt.os.linux.slackware as a last resort ..
prepare your flame retarded suit though :-p

Drew,

   This problem with loadkeys has existing for several weeks, if not several
months. It's totally separate from a distribution upgrade.

   Huh! I read that in UPGRADE.TXT when I replace 8.0 with 8.1. So, yes, I do
always run upgrades in single-user mode.

   No, not booting 2.6.x. Everything on my systems run just fine with the
2.4.x kernels.

Thanks,

Rich

Doh .. I guess I skip those little bits =p .. hmm I'm stumped .. what
happens when you run loadkeys with no input file specified?

Group,

Thanks to Paul, I have succeeded.
I have summarized what it takes to get XDMCP to work through the firewall on
FC6 below:

XDMCP Setup
        /etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess, uncomment "# * #any host can get a login
window".
        /etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config, comment out "DisplayManager.RequestPort:
0".
        fc4:/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf, set enable status to True (or 1) in
[xdmcp].
        /etc/kde/kdm/kdmrc, set enable status to True (or 1) in [xdmcp].
        The system needs to run in init level 5 (/etc/inittab).

        To increase number of sessions:
        FC4:   Change/Set DisplaysPerHost in gdm.conf
        FC5/6: Use gdmsetup: Set remote same as local; Remote admin login .


        Firewall defaults will prevent operation.  
        fc5/6: Use /usr/bin/system-config-securitylevel
        Open ports (both TCP and UDP):
             xdmcp (177)
             x11   (6000)

        Reboot the system after modification.

Well, you'll probably also need port 6000 (x11) and perhaps 7100 (xfs).

The other thing is that most X configurations these days don't open
themselves to remote access. You'll have to tweak things a bit. If you're
using GNOME, you'll want to start in /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf. 
Look for the [xdmcp] section. (If you're using a more generic X login
manager, look in /etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess.)

And I should say what exactly?

Is there any alternative such as ogg vorbis which is used for music to 
produce full DVD movies?

If I can get vmware running on top of Fedora Core 5/6 and install an
inexpensive, non Microsoft system, that will let me watch movies as a guest,
this I might not mind so much.  Does EFF stand for electronic frontier
foundation?  If the recording industry wants to use a proprietary format, 
that might be reasonable if I don't have to install Windows or the proprietary
software of any other company I don't like for that matter to view it on 
my computer.

As far as copying movies, I've heard that it is legal to copy VHS tapes that
are rented or purchased as long as a profit isn't sought by the copier.  Why
should DVD's be any different?  I suppose there are some in the motion picture
industry that hate DVD's because they don't wear out as quickly as VHS tapes 
do and you can theoretically maintain superior quality over multiple
copies to tape.

Seriously though, why shouldn't the recording industry be in the business of
forcing people to purchase proprietary technology?  After all, the recording
industry claims that it needs to make money and the movie industry views the
public as a cash cow.  Where there is a lack of acting talent, maybe some
companies are becoming desperate.  There is a whole culture that says, 
"you have to pay for it."  Unless someone can demonstrate that the wrong 
people end up paying, I doubt that anyone will get anywhere with the EFF.

As far as talking to legislators, it's generally better to do through a group.
Enough voices says, "there is a a real issue that really matters to the voters."

Based on what?  Isn't the space shuttle covered on the bottom with pelsiar
devices so that it can generate electricity when it's turned toward the sun
off of the temperature gradient?  There's zero applied power, so I don't know
what it is your talking about.

Having your processor not shut down is no big deal unless it isn't overheating.

That is why I pointed to the EFF. They provide sample letters. But comes
down to support the EFF (this is the area they specialize in) and tell
them not to add additional copyright enforcement laws and repeal some of
the ones that already exist (DMCA).

The file format is ogg, the video codec is "theora". http://www.theora.org/

Yes.

No. Various entities (such as the EFF) would tell you it is not. Some
very limited copying can be done under traditional "fair use", but that
is quite limited (mostly very short snippets, such as used for fan-made
music videos) and even that is in jeopardy due to legislative action on
behalf of the MPAA et al. Fair use most certainly DOES NOT allow copying
of entire shows, whether or not you make any profit.

Yeah, they dislike that, though with the much lower manufacturing costs
there are also reasons they like DVDs.

Yeah, they claim that. The problem is not so much the proprietary
technology, as their efforts to make even touching that illegal. Such as
making defeating DRM illegal, despite DRM being broken and defeating it
actually being fixing the problem. They are desperate though, that is why
they're resorting to using the legal system to gain them more money,
rather than trying to actually make good stuff.

Yes, that is why I'm pointing towards the EFF.

This is why SSH X tunneling is very much the prefered method of doing
things similar to this. SSH does a good job of tunneling the X
connections, and takes care of the security. Needs "-X" with OpenSSH.

I assume you mean peltier, not pelsiar.  I do not know what pelsiar is.

Zero applied power would mean no sunshine.  On the shuttle, the device is 
operated as a source of electrical energy rather than a heat transfer device 
(runs the thing backwards compared it its use in a computer).

The use of peltier devices for heat transfer uses more energy than the heat 
energy being transferred, by a factor of two in many cases.  So it is necessary 
to dump the heat from the processor plus the extra heat generated by running the 
peltier.  This is worth it in some circumstances, such as keeping something 
cooler than the heat sink temperature.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peltier-Seebeck_effect

http://www.heatsink-guide.com/content.php?content=peltierinfo.shtml

 From the above link:

Peltier elements have very low efficiency. They will consume more power than 
they transport! Actual peltier elements may consume twice as much energy (in the 
form of electricity) as they transport (in the form of heat). So, if you are 
using a peltier element, the heatsink it is used with must be much more powerful 
than a heatsink used for cooling a heat source without peltier element.

I am not Slackware conversant, but the little bit of reading that I did
leads me to believe that there are two paths to keymap modification.
One is at startup, through the *rc* process, either via 
/*etc/rc.d/rc.keymap*
or *rc.local*, using *loadkeys* to read a keymap file in a known location.
In this case *loadkeys *would indeed be running as *root, *and so would 
succeed.
The other way is through an X session startup, in which case the
keymap modifications should be in *~/.Xmodmap*, who's format,
I believe, is not the same as a keymap file read by *loadkeys*.

None of my searching turned up an example where a local user's
*~/.keymap* (or ~/.<anyfoo> for that matter) was used, in Slackware
or anywhere else. I'm gonna guess that you've been using the
~/.keymap method for a relatively long time, and maybe even have
a *loadkeys* command in your .login or .profile or .bashrc or .cshrc
or whatever your shell startup file is.

Since my (old) Mandriva system shows that I own */dev/console*, and
your Slackware and my Ubuntu do not show that, I can only
conclude that somewhere along the way Slackware changed
it's mind about how keymaps should oughta be loaded. Interestingly,
in Mandriva I can READ and parse the file as user tonyr, but cannot
update the KeyMaps (permission denied). In Ubuntu, I have no access
to *loadkeys* functionality at all as user tonyr.

Subject: [PLUG] PDF viewers for editable PDF files
Message-ID: <20061031223506.f80b80f0.johnxj@comcast.net>

When Adobe came out with Adobe Reader 7.0 they included the ability to
fill in PDF forms. The user can type into blanks in the form and then
print it out. However, the user cannot save a copy of the edited form.
At the same time that this feature was added to Reader, Acrobat was
enhanced to add the ability to create editable PDF files.

I can create editable PDF files with OpenOffice.org Writer. I have
opened them in Adobe Reader 7.08 on my Ubuntu amd-64 Dapper laptop and
I can edit the forms. I can also print them, but I cannot save them.
However, I have a workaround for the latter problem ?- CUPS-PDF
printer. I have installed it and now I can create a PDF file from any
application that can print, including Adobe Reader.

There is an equivalent to CUPS-PDF printer on Windows, called
PDF-Creator. I haven?t checked it out, but it is free from sourceforge.
As for Macs, all modern Macs come with the ability to print to file as
a PDF. It?s built into the OS.

My goal is to create homework files as editable PDFs. The student can
fill them out, print to CUPS-PDF printer or to PDF Creator, and e-mail
the results back to the professor. Fast, simple, no paper, and the
professor can actually read the student?s work because there is no
handwriting. This is ideal for distance education. This could be really
cool because in OOo you can make the editable field a blank to type
into, a radio button, a drop-down list, or any of several other types
of controls. What a cool tool for creating exams, quizzes and homework
assignments!

However, there are some gaps and questions:

1) Macintosh users. Adobe Reader 7.0 for Mac can fill out editable PDF
forms the same as the Linux and Windows versions. But I don?t have a
Mac so I can?t test the built in print-to-PDF utility. I bet the reason
Adobe Reader can?t save a copy of the edited file is a DRM issue, in
which case I bet the built in print-to-PDF utility won?t work if the
file is an edited PDF. Being the owner of an iPod it would not surprise
me if Apple included that restriction. Are there any Mac owners here
who might know?

2) I can do it on Linux with Adobe Reader 7.08, but doing so is a pain.
Adobe Reader does not have a drop-down printer selection box in it
print dialog box in the Linux version. You have to type in an lpr
command. Thus, every time I want to print to a new PDF file I have to
change the command that says it is to print to my laserjet. And then
when I want to print to the laserjet, I have to retype the command
again. To get around this I tried Kpdf, evince, and Xpdf. All of them
have a proper printer selection drop-down window, but none of them can
edit the editable PDF file. Are there other PDF viewers that might be
better than these three?

Message-ID: <200610312251.35379.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Hi all,

I wanted something to make it easy to switch networks on my wife's 
thinkpad and couldn't find anything that fit the bill.

I use ifup/ifdown with profiles defined in /etc/network/interfaces (e.g. 
"ifup eth0=eth0-home") and wanted to stick with that.  Also, I found a 
lot of gui apps for wifi, but nothing that worked with the interfaces 
file.

This uses kdialog to let you choose an interface (it reads the 
interfaces file to build a list and checks /etc/network/run/ifstate to 
tell you what's on at the moment) and then ifup's the selection after 
doing ifdown on everything else.

  http://scratchcomputing.com/svn/ifswitch/trunk/bin/ifswitch

You'll need to 'cpan IPC::Run'.  I think that's it.  Build is not really 
setup yet.  You will (of course) need ifupdown and such.

I hooked it to the thinkpad key with tpb, but it is designed to run as 
root and autodetect the user/display, so you can hook it to acpi events 
or whatever button daemon you like.

The ifscheme package does this.  I use it on my laptop.
