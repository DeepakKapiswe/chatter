Subject: [PLUG] Best File Format for OOo Writer <=> MS Word Collaboration?
Message-ID: <4f29704e.anWm7zfax8eiXCo+%jgw@sdf.org>

Greetings PLUGers,
I'm trying to help out a first-time author using OOo Writer 3.2.0 on Ubuntu
10.4 who needs to collaborate with a book editor using MS Word, probably
the 2007 version on Windows 7.  Ideally, the book editor would be using
the "Record Changes" feature in Word, then forwarding it back for the author
to run "Edit>Accept or Reject Changes" on. Probably several rounds of this
sort of thing on an approx. 400 page book.  Alternately, it appears both
programs can also merge differences via the "Compare Files" feature which
avoids having to deal with externally-generated "diffs" as with "Record
Changes".

Anyways, my simple single page tests using the .rtf format were a mixed
bag, sometimes resulting in file corruption.  The .doc format seems to be
more robust over several rounds of changes.  However, there are several
Word versions available under "File>Save As>File Type" and I'm wondering
which is most likely to be best for this project?

OOo "Save As>File Type" choices:

MS Word 6.0 (.doc)
MS Word 95 (.doc)
MS Word 97/2000/XP (.doc)
MS Word 2003 (.xml)
MS Word 2007 (.docx)  ## I think this is read-only so a non-starter

I've not tested OpenDocument Text (.fodt) or DocBook (.xml).

I am aware of the ODF Converter module for MS Office however it didn't
perform well in my tests which featured frequent MS Word (earlier 2000
version) crashes whenever an .odt file was opened.

My guess is MS Word 97/2000/XP is the best candidate but I'd like to get
some real-world feedback before committing.

Regards,

Jeff W

I can't caution /against/ this enough.

OO has a long and distinguished history or corrupting documents in
many ugly ways.  Often, this corruption only appears once the document
is loaded in Word.  eg: Everything will look peachy to the
linux/OO.org user, then the client (or in this case, publisher) will
see something that looks like it went through a blender.

This might work if you don't have any formatting or images (eg: if
you're essentially sending a text document), but given that Word is
even in the picture, I suspect that that is not the case.

The publisher may offer other formats that are acceptable, such as
LaTeX or DocBook.  Those technologies have strong support on a number
of platforms, and offer a better solution.  If Word is a requirement,
then I strongly recommend setting up a VM with Word installed, and
accessing it via VirtualBox.  It will cost $200-300 in licensing, but
you'll save days of frustration.

Anyhow, be very cautious with converting from OO -> Word; in my
experience, what you see in OO has little relation to what shows up in
Word.  If you must do it this way, then find a copy of word to at
least preview the deliverables before sending them off.

Try the latest version that is available and also try LibreOffice 
(www.*libreoffice*.org) There have been numerous changes made since the 
fork to LibreOffice.

FWIW, I regularly use LibreOffice 3.3.4 on my Fedora system to open 
received .docx files for my wife and save them in Word97 .doc files so 
she can edit them. She has been successful sharing these with 
colleagues.  She uses the equation editor, but not the change tracking 
features you mention.  I think investigation would be worth your time.

Interesting.  I was just corresponding this morning with a new Ubuntu
user who was telling me that she couldn't find the option to save in
*.doc format in LibreOffice.  I wonder if Ubuntu's version is behind
Fedora and doesn't have that capability, or if she just couldn't find
where to do it?  (I don't know her well, but I get the distinct
impression her computer skills are not highly developed.)  I suggested
to her she might check into installing OpenOffice.org, but perhaps
that isn't necessary.

Could she have been thinking it would be an export type of function 
under the File menu?

Tell her it's in the dialog box that opens when she tells Libre Office 
to save the file. There is a line that says, "File Type" and has a 
little arrowhead pointing to the right. If she clicks on that line the 
arrow head changes to pointing down and there is the list of all the 
available file types. My Ubuntu installation of Libre Office has options 
for saving as a .doc in MS Word 97/2000/XP or MS Word 95. There are also 
options for saving as MS Word 2003 XML (.xml) and MS Word 2007 XML 
(.docx). These are lower in the list, and not adjacent to the .doc 
options. Perhaps that's why she couldn't find .doc.

Another possibility is that she was looking for the way to tell Libre 
Office to always save a file as .doc. This is under the Tools > Options 
menu in the Load/Save section. The extensions are not shown, but the one 
she probably would want is MS Word 97/2000/XP. In this tool all the MS 
file type options are grouped together. It might have been confusing to 
her because the file extensions are not shown.

I fixed the wireless.  I loaded Meego, release 1.1, on it and edited the 
/etc/rc.sysinit file adding the following line:
ifconfig wlan0 up
before the line:
[ -x /usr/sbin/connmand ] && /usr/sbin/connmand -W nl80211,wext

It is running an ancient kernel, 2.6.35.13-23.1-netbook.

            Intro to Salt / Salt Stack (saltstack.org)

                        <daniel at digitree.org>

Salt is a distributed configuration management and remote execution
platform built on top of ZeroMQ and Python. Simple, fast, powerful and
extensible.

Daniel will give a presentation on the architecture of Salt and how it
leverages ZeroMQ to provide a simple but highly scalable and parallel
method of software deployment.

"Salt is a distributed remote execution system used to execute
commands and query data. It was developed in order to bring the best
solutions found in the world of remote execution together and make
them better, faster and more malleable. Salt accomplishes this via its
ability to handle larger loads of information, and not just dozens,
but hundreds or even thousands of individual servers, handle them
quickly and through a simple and manageable interface."

Thanks, Dick.  I told her where I thought it would be, based on where
it is in OpenOffice, and what you're describing sounds like a very
similar location.  I'll pass along your description and see if that
helps her.

   I want to write a shell script to run as a cron job that checks the
Frontier-assigned IP address of my DSL line against the current IP address
and, if changed, uploads the changed address to namecheap.com's DNS servers.

   I can see the address (at least while it's static) on my Netgear VFS318,
but there's not a specific URL for that field on the admin web page. There
are a bunch of web-based lookup sites; while they immediately display my IP
address I don't see a way to extract that information from the web page
(perhaps in the page source code?) for local storage and upload to
namecheap.com.

   Many of you folks are professional network administrators and may already
have such a script. Or, you can advise me how to proceed.

whatismyip.com has an automation page that returns ONLY the IP
address.  You can easily use curl with the correct link. For
bash:

   MYIP=$(curl http://automation.whatismyip.com/n09230945.asp)

Jim,

   Now that is super convenient! This I will use in the script, and then use
Mike's suggestion of ddclient to push it to namecheap.

Thank you both very much,

Be sure to pay attention to WhatIsMyIP's usage policy (spelled out
in the FAQ).  In essence, try not to hit that link more than once
every 5 minutes, less often if possible.

Jim,

   Since the IP address _should_ be relatively stable, I doubt that I need to
run the cron job more than once per hour.

Thanks,

To make it lil' easier on WhatIsMyIP, you could run a ping test for a few
days, weeks to figure out the DHCP lease time. Really, unless they change
something on their end or there's a loss of IP connectivity between you and
your service provider your current leased ip addr should continue to be
renewed.

Perhaps, the most efficient way to do this is incorporate a ping test into
your script. When the ping fails for a given amount of time say 5 or 10
mins, then run the curl whatsmyipaddress command, compare it against your
last known ip addr and then update DNS.

If you are running a DHCP client, then when your dynamic ipaddr
changes your ping will continue to succeed and you won't be able to
tell that anything has changed.  The better answer is to take control
of the software running on the gateway and just have a script *there*
watch for a ipaddr change.  OpenWrt FTW!

In reality the assigned DHCP ip address on a DSL modem shouldn't change
that often. In fact most providers will tie a the MAC Address of the DSL
modem to a specific ip address in the DHCP pool via a mac address
reservation for better record keeping.

The only circumstances that the assigned DHCP ip address might change is if
the there's a loss of ip connectivity between the DSL modem and the DHCP
server that originally assigned the leased ip address and if there's an ip
network reconfiguration / reassignment at the ISP. If you disconnect the
DSL modem from the network and the reconnect it as long as it talks to the
same DHCP server the originally assigned DHCP ip address should be
reallocated according to how the DHCP life cycle works.

If the assigned DHCP ip address does change, the ping should fail because
the originally assigned DHCP ip address will be pulled back into the pool
and very likely not reassigned within a few minutes. DLS modems are not
requesting new IP addresses at the rate you would expect laptops connecting
to a WIFI AP at an airport.

If I were doing this, I'd spend a bit of time studying how often and under
what circumstances the DHCP assigned ip address of your DSL modem changes
before  writing one line of code...

Ah, you mean to ping the last known public ipaddr of the DSL modem.
That wasn't clear.


[ Internal host ] --- [ DSL ] ---- [ ISP ] --- [ whatsmyip.org ]

So, your suggestion is to have a script on the internal host that
every hour or so queries whatsmyip.org and every
<much-more-frequently> pings the ipaddr that query returns.  If the
ping fails significantly, re-query whatsmyip.org immediately.  If
ipaddr has changed, fire off the DNS change.

What type of URL is it? HTTP? FTP? There's really not a one-to-one
mapping of URLs to specific files, or even directories. There's nothing
that says the server even has to provide a list of files visible
at a given path. Some servers do so as a default, but others may
not. You have to know how to request a list of those files from the
server, be able to parse it, and then issue the appropriate commands.

   When I navigate to that page I can see all the files and select each one

   I'm trying to update the BIOS on my Dell Latitude E5410. The only firmware
files I can download from Dell come in .exe format. I have installed
'dellBiosUpdate-compat' which works with a .hdr file, not an .exe file.

   I've installed Wine on that machine (aside: despite the disclaimer on the
SlackBuilds.org web site, Wine builds, installs, and runs using the multilib
and 32-bit-compat libraries), but it won't run the .exe file and neither
will dellBiosUpdate-compat.

   I thought that perhaps the .exe was a self-extracting archive, but it's
not and will not produce the .hdr file with a Windows version of unzip.exe
under Wine.

   For those of you working in a multi-boot environment and knowledgeable of
Windows, is there a way to extract a .hdr file from these .exe files, or do
I need to beg Dell for the proper format?

   Dell does have a directory of .hdr files, but not for the ID 0x0429 that
is my machine; they have 0x0420 and 0x043c files.

I can't imagine that Wine would do what you need because the .exe needs
to access hardware that is on the very bottom of the pile.

I don't know the answer to your question, but I wonder if the .exe will
run under DOS. If so, it is pretty easy to make a bootable DOS USB
stick using FreeDOS. I have done so and I know nothing. I even still
have the USB stick somewhere.

I do this all the time with wget. I use -r  to get everything, then remove
what I don't want afterwards.

As I recall, the wildcards (*, ?, etc) only work with FTP.

wget can do that for you.  My preferred wget command line:

  wget -nc -k -r -np YOUR_URL_HERE

With that command line, wget will download the document pointed to in
the specified URL, plus (potentially) any documents linked from it.

The options in that command line tell wget to:

  "-nc": Not overwrite files that have already been downloaded. This
is handy if you have to halt the download and start over again for
some reason.

  "-k": Convert links in the documents downloaded so that they point
to each other, and not, potentially, to the server they were
downloaded from. This is handy if the documents contain
fully-qualified URLs (e.g.,
http://appl-ecosys.com/photos/my_dog_spot.jpg) as opposed to relative
URLs (e.g., ../photos/my_dog_spot.jpg).

  "-r": Download recursively (i.e., follow links to documents in
sub-directories).

  "-np": Don't follow any links to directories above the one
specified. E.g., if the URL provided on the command line is
http://appl-ecosys.com/good_times/sunday.html, and that document
contains a link to http://appl-ecosys/photos/my_dog_spot.jpg, the
photo of your dog Spot will not be downloaded. This option is critical
in my experience. Without it, you could come back to find wget has
downloaded half the Internet while you weren't looking.

Paul,

   I saw that on the man page, But that does not download all files shown on
that page when they're not linked to each other.

   Example (and what set me looking for a solution): I wanted to download all
multilib libraries (those that allow both 34- and 64-bit applications to be
built and run on the box) and the 32-bit compatible libraries. Each is a
separate tarball, but the list is on a single web page.

Thanks,

Rich

Ken,

   That seems specific to MegaTrends boards/BIOSes. I suspect it would not
work on the Dell. Anywho, I have the FreeDOS iso and will buy a small USB
flash drive this morning so I can install fd11src.iso and the BIOS .hdr
files on it.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <4F3027B5.6030701@cyber-office.net>

I'm looking for some examples of bad coding.  Specifically programs that 
  ignore their children (creating zombie processes) and that do not exit 
cleanly (creating orphans) for init to adopt.

Though that may sound like I know what I'm talking about I don't 
completely.  I was asked during an interview about the kill command 
which led to getting rid of zombie process.  I made a complete fool of 
myself with my answer (who frets about no-human zombies theses days?) so 
went a-lookin' and found the _right_ (more correct?) answer(s).  Now I'd 
like to test them.
    The example code I've found so far has been pretty simplistic -- 
create a bunch of zombie processes then exit cleanly, cleaning up after 
itself.  Plus the program didn't run long enough to even test using 
'kill -s SIGCHLD <ppid>'.
    Finally I'd like it to exit without cleaning up causing the 
zombie(s) to become an orphans.

Not asking much am I?  :-)


TIA,
Rod

Hello and good afternoon,

 : I'm looking for some examples of bad coding. 

You may have come to the right store.  Well, anyway, I'm happy to 
place my own bad coding examples on display here.

 : Specifically programs that ignore their children (creating zombie 
 : processes) and that do not exit cleanly (creating orphans) for 
 : init to adopt.

Why are there so many angry teenagers in the world, bent on becoming 
zombies?  While I'm not crazy about the Twilight series, I guess I 
like a vampire-centric world a bit more than these pesky 
parent-hating zombies.

You have two questions there.  One question is about creating 
zombies and the other is about orphans.  They are two distinct 
issues.  The code below, should illustrate first abandonment:

  $ perl zombie.pl abandon
  I forked a kid (PID 3224) and abandoned it.
  I hate my parent (PPID 3223)!
  $ My parent abandoned me (PPID now 1)!

Note that the parent exits and we get a shell prompt back.  Three 
seconds later, the child reports its new parent and then exits.
This code also demonstrates zombification (two shells open to do 
this):

  $ perl zombie.pl zombie
  I forked a kid (PID 3231) and plan on ignoring it.
  I hate my parent (PID 3230)!
  My parent is ignoring me--as retribution, I'm going to become a zombie as PID 3231.
  Check the process table with 'ps w 3231', and you'll see that 3231 is a zombie.

And, here's your zombie:

  $ ps www 3231
    PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
   3231 pts/16   Z+     0:00 [perl] <defunct>

OK, so what should you read to get a better handle on what's going 
on here?  My advice is to dig up a copy of 'Advanced Programming in 
the Unix Environment' (APUE) by W. Richard Stevens and Stephen Rago 
and read the first 8 or 9 sections of the Process Control chapter 
(chapter 8).

I would note, as well, that process control and signal handling are 
reasonably intertwined, so if you are going to dive into APUE, I'd 
suggest reading the chapter on Signals (chapter 10), as well.

 : Though that may sound like I know what I'm talking about I don't 
 : completely.  I was asked during an interview about the kill 
 : command which led to getting rid of zombie process. 

The kill command does not get rid of zombie processes--not when 
applied to the zombies themselves, at any rate.  You would have to 
find the parent and send a signal to the parent to get it to either 
A) reap its children or B) exit, thereby letting init do the job.

 : I made a complete fool of myself with my answer (who frets about 
 : no-human zombies theses days?) so went a-lookin' and found the 
 : _right_ (more correct?) answer(s).  Now I'd like to test them.

Unless something is seriously broken on your system, or with your 
init, or init replacement (runit, upstart, etc.), then your init 
process should reap the zombies quite quickly after they become 
orphaned.

Others may be able to provide more detail on why this is, or whether 
this is uniformly the case across various *nix, but a child which 
has been orphaned is typically inherited by process ID 1, a.k.a. 
init.

This is better than I hoped for.  Just what I needed ... and in Perl.

This I understand now.

I think -- reading this now -- I may have forgotten to check for the 
parent pid and assumed they hadn't become orphans.  Well actually they 
went away when the program ended so must have been reaped and not abandoned.

This was my understanding after doing some research but I really want to 
test it; therefore my questions.  Other upsides were I came across an 
new command (or one I don't remember ever reading/using) 'watch' and got 
into 'ps' like never before.
    A positive side to doing less than stellar on an interview. :-)

Thanks for the more in depth explanation and code.

The interlinks for the files have no effect on this.
I just set up what I believe is the kind of site you are accessing, based on your descriptions.
A "web page" that is an auto generated list of files in a directory:

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1202070854240.12163@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   After a half-hour on the phone with a tech rep from Dell I learn that Dell
builds some portables (including some Latitude models) so that the BIOS can
be upgrade with linux (i.e., they provide the firmare as .hdr files), and
others can _only_ be upgraded via Windows or DOS. My E5410 (and its
replacement, the E5420) will run linux perfectly but the BIOSes cannot be
upgraded with this OS.

   If someone has a FreeDOS bootable USB stick on which I can copy the two
.exe files (because the BIOS version needs to be upgraded first to A10, then
A11) I would like to borrow it.

   Alternatively, if someone can teach me how to make a bootable FreeDOS USB
drive with a vfat file system rather than an iso9660 file system
(read-only) from fd11src.iso, that would work, too.

   I'm quite upset that Dell would support linux on only some models and not
others. But, since I've a lot of money invested in this laptop I want to
upgrade the BIOS so it will use all 8G of RAM and fix a few other glitches.

I have such a USB stick. I was even able to find it. It is only 512 MB,
because I made it a long time ago when that was the sweet spot for
prices of USB sticks. 

Now the trick is how to get it to you. I am in North Portland, but
tomorrow afternoon I will go to PSU. If I recall correctly from previous
conversations, you are extremely suburban. It might be cheaper

This would be the ideal scenario. Tragically, I cannot remember how I
made the bootable USB stick.

   I have (had?) a 128M one but cannot immediately put my hands on it. The
two .exe files are 2.8M each so space is not an issue.

   I spent time futzing with the USB drive here and will test it tomorrow or
Thursday (depending on how much client work I get done today and how much of
tomorrow is getting around Frontier's blocking of outgoing port 25 even
though they're not the ISP but the copper between here and aracnet.

   Anyway, I used parted to remove all partitions on the stick. Then cfdisk
to make two partitions: /dev/sdb1 is vfat 32 (10M) and /dev/sdb2 is vfat 32
LBA (the rest of the 4G drive). /boot/initrd-tree/sbin/mkfs.vfat put the
file systems on each partition.

   Turns out that FreeDOS 1.1 lacks the bootable capabilities of 1.0. So I
downloaded dfbasews.iso and fdboot.img. The former has not been used, but I
used dd to copy fdboot.img on /dev/sdb1 (wasting most of the space, but that
doesn't matter at all). For whatever reason, I as user could not copy the
two BIOS files (*.exe) to /dev/sdb2, but root could. So, now I have
command.com, driver/, fdconfig.sys, freedos/, and kernel.sys in /dev/sd1 and
the BIOS images on /dev/sdb2. As soon as I can, I'll boot the laptop with
the USB drive (I think that kernel.sys is what's needed, then see if it
finds the .exe files to run.

More when I have it,

Rich

I didn't actually test my USB stick here because I can't easily reboot
the computer at the moment. But I stuck it in a port and observed the
following files on it:

m613z15
	ABITFAE.BAT
	awdflash.exe
	M613Z_15.BIN
	M613Z_15.TXT
	RUNME.BAT
fdboot.img.old
fdodin91_2.img
ldlinux.sys
m613z15.zip
memdisk
Shortcut to CD Drive.lnk
syslinux.cfg

<+ a bunch of irrelevant coursework files>

The .old file was probably a renaming done by me, as I commonly
add .old to files when I want to get rid of it, yet save it for just in
case.

The awdflash.exe file I am sure was the file I used to flash an Award
BIOS on my old laptop, a Compaq R3200. It was at least five years ago.
But at least it tells me that FreeDOS can run an .exe file.

If I mail this to you it would arrive no later than Thursday, probably
tomorrow. Better you should have it and not need it than need it and
not have it.

Subject: [PLUG] Anyone use the Blue Snowball USB mic w/ Linux?
Message-ID: <4F31FE36.3010208@zenlinux.com>

Hello,

I'm getting serious about developing some screencasts at work, and I'd 
like to get a decent microphone for voice recording. I have some friends 
who have done podcasting before who rave about the Snowball USB 
microphone by Blue:

http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Snowball-Microphone-Aluminum/dp/B002OO333Q/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1328676180&sr=8-2

My searches are coming up with conflicting reports on whether this 
microphone works with Linux. As I'm trying to sort this out, I thought 
it wouldn't hurt to ask on this list if anyone has experience with this 
mic under Linux.

Alternate recommendations for something good quality known to work very 
well with Linux at under $75 are also welcome.

Thanks,

Scott

I briefly looked into voice recording on the computer. I don't have 
direct experience with that microphone, or any other USB mic. I do have 
a recommendation from some professionals that one should stick with an 
analog mic connected to the mic in port of the sound hardware. They 
talked about latency or some such.

Like I said, I don't have direct experience. But if you're doing any 
multi track work, delays from the USB mic might be noticeable.

Have you considered a Zoom digital recorder?  Easy to use, great quality.

I have used this device with Linux and it works just fine.  It has
been working fine with the last few versions of Ubuntu.  Sometimes
Pulse Audio messes things up and reverts back to the internal mic
after a boot, but once it's working and selected as the main source,
Skype and such seem to pick it up just fine.

Subject: [PLUG] Resetting the WordPress admin user password
Message-ID: <4F32C962.2000702@comcast.net>

Back in early December, 2011, I installed WordPress on my home Apache 
web server. Then I got busy and didn't use it. I carefully logged the 
password for the admin user in the notebook I use to track changes I 
make to the machine. That's not where I usually write down passwords, so 
when I had some time the other day to fiddle with WordPress again I 
couldn't find the password. The log in screen offers to reset the 
password and send it by e-mail but it appears that's on option that I 
have to turn on. Of course, I didn't turn it on, and I need the password 
to get to the place where I can turn that feature on. Sigh.

So, I Googled the problem and found this page:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Resetting_Your_Password

I followed the instructions in the section "Through MySQL Command Line" 
but I still can't get in. I do remember my MySQL password and I can 
successfully step through all the steps in that method of resetting a 
password. I tried both the one where I manually run md5sum on a file 
with just the new password in it, and the version of the method that 
takes advantage of the MD5 function in newer versions of MySQL. Both 
looked like they worked, and both produced the same md5 string. But 
neither of them got me past the login screen for WordPress.

At this point I'm willing to drop the wordpress database and start the 
installation over since I don't have anything of significance invested 
in it, but that doesn't seem like the UNIX way. So I ask the assembled 
wizards if there's something else I can try.

Thanks for any and all ideas.

Just out of curiosity, did you try any of the other methods (ftp, email,
emergency script) that were offered? It's possible there could also be some
kind of db corruption that's hanging things up.

John,

   Hold off for the moment. I need to learn if my USB stick will work. And,
tonight Frontier is switching me from a static IP address to their DHCP
server and that requires reconfiguring postfix, too, to use port 587
outbound rather than port 25. I think a lot of tomorrow will be spent geting
mail working again.

The only other one I tried was email. But I probably haven't set that up 
right, yet, so it didn't work.

I missed the emergency script method. I just tried that and it worked.

Thanks. I put the new password in my normal hiding place instead of in 
my log book.

Bill,

   Someone on the SlackBuilds.org mail list just submitted a package to build
unetbootin on Slackware. As soon as it's approved I'll give it a try.

   Now that I figured out how to replace a VFAT file system on the USB flash
drives I don't worry about getting them all messed up. :-)

Thanks,

Rich

When a client app uses LDAP for authentication . . .

Must it
request user attributes (for example email addr / mail ) from the server?
? or
Does the server push those attributes?

My sniffing
says if you asked for authentication all you get is a result code showing
success or failure.? But in the context of what we've done I cannot yet
rule out some caching of information by the application.? 

So
which is it?

I'm not an expert but I've worked on authentication via LDAP for 
Subversion. It is my understanding that all you get, by default, is 
confirmation of authentication. You have to request any further information.

By "the system" do you mean the bios, or the OS (Linux, presumably?)?

If it's the former, then there may be a hardware problem, if it's the
later, then you probably just need to install a different kernel.

In my experience, the SMP kernels shipped with common distros also
have the proper support for seeing > 4gb of ram, but others on this

The first test is to look in the BIOS to see if the BIOS is in fact, seeing all the RAM. If it is, then it's a software issue. If the BIOS isn't seeing all the RAM, then I suspect a hardware issue that a BIOS update will not resolve. 

But that last part is just an educated guess.

Rich,

Of course you reseated your memory a couple of times.  Another reason 
may be you need to switch pairs around.  Another reason maybe bad 
memory.  Have you been able to run a memory checker?  It might ignore 
the BIOS.

Russell, Wes, et al.:

   After I sent the message (of course!) I realized that I needed to check
the BIOS setup. Apparently, one of the memory modules was not fully seated,
so I took them both out, swapped them (which would tell me if one was bad),
and carefully re-inserted them. The system now sees all 8G.

Mea culpa!

   There are a number of perl experts here so I hope that I can get the help
I need. Frontier has changed my IP address three times since last Wednesday;
about every 2 days. Therefore, I need to build, configure, and use ddclient
to check the IP address and update the DNS servers on namecheap.com when
there's a chenge.

   The SlackBuild.org ddclient requires the perl module, perl-IO-Socket-SSL.
I cannot download and install it using 'perl -MCPAN -e shell' nor the links
to the source or homepage on the SBo web page. I am hoping one of you
experts might help me find a copy of version 1.24 (or later) so I can move
ahead with ddclient.

TIA,

Rich

Don't sweat it. I'll bet that nearly every one of us has done the same a time or two.

ddclient? If so, I'd like a reality check on my ddclient.conf file.

   I read the namecheap knowledge base and _think_ I have it correct, but I'm

I sent you a very simple script which works quite well for updating
Namecheaps DNS servers. All you had to do was add your passwords and
domains and change that one line that determined your current IP
address.
Does it not work. It should be much easier to configure than ddclient.

Rich,
   You can use this in my script in place of the line that queries the

NEWIP=$(curl -s http://automation.whatismyip.com/n09230945.asp)

Rich,
At a more fundamental level, updating the DNS server is just a matter
of putting the new IP address in a url and accessing that url.
Here is the relevant explanation.

Bill,

   I know about this syntax. /etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf has a sample section
for NameCheap, and namecheap.com's Knowledgebase has directions for
switching the DNS to Dynamic and assigning passwords as well as a sample
section for ddclient.conf.

   However, I see discrepancies between the ddclient.conf section for
NameCheap and the latter's Knowledgebase. The former uses the domain name(s)
and the latter the login name. Also, I have two domains (sharing the same IP
address) and an A record and MX record for each. Since I'm far from familiar
with this whole DNS process I've no idea if I've created a valid .conf file.

   Also, how do I set the daemon to at least 600 seconds in the script?

   Just in case you or someone else has some expertise to share, here is
/etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf with my namecheap passwords removed:

daemon=300				# check every 300 seconds
syslog=yes				# log update msgs to syslog
mail=root				# mail all msgs to root
mail-failure=root			# mail failed update msgs to root
pid=/var/run/ddclient.pid		# record PID in file.
ssl=yes					# use ssl-support.  Works with
 					# ssl-library

## To obtain an IP address from Web status page (using the proxy if defined)
## by default, checkip.dyndns.org is used if you use the dyndns protocol. 
## Using use=web is enough to get it working. WARNING: set deamon at least
## to 600 seconds if you use checkip or you could get banned from their

I have been hooking asterisk to vitelity.net to provide my in and out
trunks, and it usually works well.  Once in a while, maybe once or twice a
week, I can make a bad call, and the person I called has a hard time
understanding me.  When that happens, I can call the echo number
9093900009, and sure enough, my voice is breaking up.

I've submitted 4 trouble tickets to Vitelity, and they say they have made
routing changes, but the problem keeps recurring.  They ask for a
traceroute to I guess their server when it acts up, and here is the current
one, in case someone on the list can solve my problem with this.

 It looks like it is taking the long way there.

In fact the phone isn't working at all right now.

The asterisk log is full of:
[2012-02-12 04:02:02] VERBOSE[32718] asterisk.c: -- Remote UNIX connection

ptimlick at 64.2.142.15' timed out, trying again (Attempt #3)
(probably 30 more lines as above)

I'll reboot my asterisk box, and that might heal it up for a while.

Does anyone have experience with a voip provider who delivers reliable,
quality voip calls over a DSL line, in the Portland Metro Area?

Hello all,

 From what I can tell, few laptops have three mouse buttons with the 
most common one appearing to be a ThinkPad.

Could anyone with a three mouse button laptop please comment on its 
comfort, for lack of a better term? The ThinkPad third button appears to 
be above, rather than below the trackpad, leading me to question its 
usefulness.

Thanks,

I've been lurking here for months since I took a class with Dave Mandel. Finally, a question I work with.

I have two Thinkpads: a X100e and a R61e. They both have a third button.

I never use the third button on either of my Thinkpads. 

It doesn't really get in my way though. So, I wouldn't call it uncomfortable. I just wouldn't call it useful.

My Dell Precision M6500 has 3 mouse buttons.

Standard configuration, trackpad above and three buttons in a row below.

It seems to work well, though I don't use the middle button much, it would
be comfortable if I did.

I've used a couple of ThinkPads, and never had any trouble using the
middle "mouse" button.  I must admit, though, that I always used the
trackpointer, rather than the trackpad, so the the upper buttons were
in the right place.

If all else fails, I suppose one could buy one of those cute little
pocket-sized "laptop mice".

I've owned a few ThinkPads and the buttons worked so great for me I bought
a stand alone keyboard with the same configuration to use with my desktop.

The laptop provided by my employer, an HP Elitebook has three buttons below 
the spacebar and three below the track pad.  I use them equally.

Linux life without three button mouse is painful in my experience. 
I paste with it all the time.

I disable the trackpad, and use the trackpoint ("eraser tip")
only.  The upper three mouse buttons work with that. 

The trackpoint is easier on my back.  I don't need to turn my
upper body into a rigid platform to keep my hand still for a
trackpad or mouse.  I usually leave my palms in one place on
the palm rest, moving the trackpoint with whatever index
finger is free, and mostly use thumbs on the mouse buttons
for point and click.  For precise work (such as selecting
a row of text or drawing a box) I use the other index
finger on on the buttons - thumbs aren't as agile.

For the small subset of you getting older:  my hands are still
quite steady, but I know folks in their late forties and early
fifties that are developing some tremor in their hands.  That,
combined with back pain, makes a trackpad hard to use.  And if
Don Knuth (xkcd/163) is sitting next to you at a conference, and
wants to borrow your laptop to check email, the trackpoint helps.

If you get a laptop with a trackpoint, use the "mushroom cap"
top, and have a spare around.  They polish and lose friction
over a year or so.  The bigger cap won't dimple your finger,
and because there is more surface the friction is better with
a lighter touch.

Trackpads, trackpoints, and mice are kludges.  Someday,
somebody will invent a better way to manipulate the pointer.
Something that allows your back to roam.  Perhaps a tongue
mouse.  Then /nobody/ will ask to borrow your laptop. :-)

Obviously, tastes vary.  

I use the trackpad on my thinkpads (a T42 and a T60p).  And I use the
middle mouse button, which I like.  I primarily use the buttons below
the trackpad with my thumb for left/right.  I never use the trackpoint
thingie, but I appreciate it being there just the same, because it
looks cool, and might save my ass if the trackpad were to ever flake
out.

I don't have a middle mouse button on my netbook trackpads, and i miss it.

I *REALLY* like the keyboard illumination feature on the Thinkpads (it
hurt me when keith broke one once while I was watching).

I have never pressed the "ThinkVantage" button, so I don't even know
what it does or is supposed to do, but it sounds AWESOME, whatever it
is.

   Yesterday evening, just before Frontier changed my IP address for the
second time that day, someone here posted a response that IP addresses don't
change unless the DSL bridge or router go off-line. I accidently deleted
that message, but will respond now.

   Other than a middle-of-the-night power outage a few weeks ago that
darkened the entire neighborhood, there have been no incidents that have
taken the DSL bridge or router off-line in several years. Last evening, I
was sitting here working on this host when I checked alpine at 7:00pm and
saw the mail from the hourly cron job that showed the old IP address as
ending in .248 and the new one ending in .110. No power changes to explain
why it changed.

   I may be the only one being hassled by Frontier this way, but it's not
because I'm doing something wrong here.

   Now I believe that I have the DNS servers properly configured for the MX
records on both domains and need to wait for Frontier's next change to see
if the cron job script successfully changes the IP addresses for both
domains.

Is this still the fallout from SpiritOne dropping support for fixed
IP addresses? If so, I would expect this is an issue with SpiritOne,
not Frontier. I don't think Frontier necessarily needs to be blamed
for what's probably a configuration issue at SpiritOne.

It's possible that they configured the DHCP server with unrealistic
lease times. It's also possible that your router isn't requesting the
same IP address when it tries to renew the lease.

If it's SpiritOne you should call them and see if they can help. While
I'm disappointed by their change in policy they've always been 
proactive in helping with issues like this - that's one of the reasons
I stayed with DSL/SpiritOne long after Fios became available in my
neighborhood.

John,

   Actually, it's the fallout from Frontier dropping support of fixed IP
addresses and SpiritOne's routers not accommodating the change. At least,
that's what they tell us. DSL-only is not affected by Frontier's changes.

   I know of one other Aracnet/SpiritOne customer with the same issues as I
have on frequent IP address changes, and one who has seen no such changes
since the switch last Tuesday. So, milage varies with driver.

   What I've been told by Aracnet/SpiritOne is that they would have preferred
retaining static IP addresses for those of us with them. I get the
impression that it's a hardware/router software issue, but I neither know
what it could be nor care to know.

   If the simple script Bill Barry provided updates the DNS servers every
time Frontier changes out IP address I really don't care how often this
occurs. It was usefull to know the static IP address because too many hotel
servers (running Microsoft, of course, and maintained by those of
questionable skills) cannot resolve the IP address when I enter 'ssh
appl-ecosys.com'. Yet all of these worked flawlessly when I entered 'ssh
216.99.206.23'. Now, of course, I cannot determine the IP address unless I'm
able to get it via a Web browser first.

   Bought my friend a Sony Vaio VPCEG to replace the failing Toshiba
Satellite. She was working on the Toshiba (connected to the 'Net via the
wireless AP here) while I installed xubuntu-11.10 without networking on the
Sony. Now I want to configure networking and get it working upon boot/login,
but I'm not having any success.

   As you well know, I don't know the Debian-based distributions such as the
ubuntus. I try 'iwconfig wlan0' but that does not bring it up; ifconfig -a
shows no network RUNNING. I've left /etc/networks/interfaces as the
installation default because that's the way it appears in the working
laptop. Same with /etc/host* and /etc/networking. I've also looked at the
ubuntu wiki pages found with Google searches, but haven't seen what I need.
I'm really at a loss on what to do. If it was Slackware I'd be able to fix
everything, but the laptop does not see any wireless networks while the old
one sees ours as well as a half-dozen in the neighborhood.

   I'd appreciate guidance and directions to get this working this week; as a
last resort, I'll bring it to Sunday's clinic for help from all the experts
there.

If this is a 'buntu disto, you're probably best off using
NetworkManager.  That is, so far as I know, the default for them, same
as it is for Fedora.  I don't know about straight Debian, though.

There should be an icon in the info tray for NetworkManager if it's
running.  If it is, you can set up the networking from there -- right
click on the icon and select "Edit Connections..."  Select your
interface and click "Edit..."  Set it up as you want, and click the
"Available to all users" checkbox.  That may be your whole problem,
right there.  NM always seems to default to that being unchecked.
(*grrr* *snarl* *snap!snap!*)

Anyway, I hope this helps.

What they identified was flaws in two databases of products of
allegedly random numbers.  With luck, those were put there to
troll for researchers.   Probably not, sigh.   Random is hard.

I sell hardware random numbers (I hope).  ALL random numbers
are hardware random numbers.   Some come from hardware running
software that is seeded from limited entropy that may have
unexpectedly high correlation.  Your computer did not get a
correlation/entropy test before it was shipped. 

If your entropy generator is dependent on the user flailing
at "random" on the keyboard and looking at timing, the keys
won't be all that random.  Hands and fingers trajectories
are predictable by physics and psychology.  Timing resolution
is dependent on the keyboard scan rate (80 to 400Hz), not
the exact microsecond your finger landed on the key.  If
the scan rate was faster, your keyboard would emit a lot
more detectable EM radiation, making you vulnerable to
a TEMPEST attack. 

With the right model, I bet the entropy of keyboard banging
will turn out to be a LOT less than programmers imagine.

A lot of things are like that.  Hardware designers try to
design entropy OUT of their systems, so they behave more
predictably and are less likely to fail.

Those "random" numbers are used as a seed for a polynomial
generator.  That generates a lot of numbers, most of which
are not primes.  Primality can't be proved, but it can be
strongly conjectured by repeatedly running so-called
"orthogonal" tests, each one doubling the confidence that
the number is prime.  You might run a thousand tests, and
expect the chance that a surviving candidate is not a prime
is one in 2^1000.  But if there is any correlation at all
in the tests, not between a pair, but in large combinations
of them when applied to the subset of seeds your entropy
generator produces, you are hosed.  And how do you examine
all the combinations?  The math becomes much too hard.
You just hope a lot, and ignore the fact that many eyes
tend to make all secrets public.

Even if the numbers really are prime, this kind of test
is a sieve - it throws out non-primes with high confidence,
but it also throws out plenty of primes.  There may be
detectable patterns in that, "the ghost of the sieve",
resulting in a subset of possible primes that are far more
predictable than you would like.

The first question about random /must/ be:  how can you tell?
The second question is, what are the consequences of a failure?

There are two applicable xkcd cartoons:

Message-ID: <20120215050939.GA29939@gate.kl-ic.com>

Many web pages come with a left and right sidebar (and banners
and footers and all sorts of other nonsense).  Using Firefox,
if I want to print just the content in the middle, I can try
selecting it with the mouse, but the "print selection" checkbox
is often disabled.

I found a Really Cool firefox addon:  "Print Edit" (V 7.1 )
This allows me to graphically edit the page, selecting the
elements I want to print or delete.  I can reformat the edited
page with my own CSS.  I can save the result locally.  All I
really need to do for now is delete the left sidebar, but it
is nice to know there are tools for serious page surgery.

It would be nice to have an option or addon that lets me
combine multiple edited page fragments into a new page,
so I can remix content, but that may be going Too Far.

Mike,

   I'll work on this this evening. I can use the ethernet connection, I
hope!, to get the rfkill; since wireless connection isn't working I cannot
use either the package manager or the command line to access it from outside
here.

   Since the Intel Web site says that this radio chip has been in the kernel
since 2.6.24 I would suspect it's a ubuntu glitch. Obviously, the older
Toshiba has a different radio since there was no problem with xubuntu-11.10
on it.

   I have a ton of client work to get out today, and Frontier Comm. changed
my IP address twice last evening (7 and 8 pm) and the cron script changes
only one domain at namecheap.com. This is the 8th IP address since last
Wednesday evening at 9:07pm when they took away my static IP address. Makes
no sense to change it this frequently, but it's out of my control even
though it really ticks me off. So, I won't get back to getting the Sony
working wirelessly until after work.

Thanks,

Rich

I highly doubt it is related to a bug in Ubuntu since I have the same 
hardware in my laptop
and have zero issues. If you would like to join us on Freenode #ubuntu-us-or
we have a number of people from Canonical's various teams and 
experienced users
who could troubleshoot this for you.

Subject: [PLUG] Recommendation desired for Open Source project lurking
Message-ID: <4F3BFA31.9040802@comcast.net>

A management consultant needs to understand how collaboration works in 
open source. I wondered if lurking on the development mailing list of an 
open source project would be enlightening.

Does anyone have any recommendations for what list(s) would be useful in 
that regard?

Thanks.

I have a SATA hard drive with the following partition structure:

255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 121601 cylinders, total 1953525168 sectors

Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

Disk identifier: 0xa8a8a8a8

?? Device Boot????? Start???????? End????? Blocks?? Id? System

Parted won't work with it because FreeBSD (sdb1) goes beyond the end of the disk. In any case, I'd just like to get rid of that partition, but I can't use parted to do it. Will fdisk itself do it with d and then 1? In the meantime, I'm going to try to back up the Linux partitions, which I want to keep: in any case, "destructive" partitioning will be necessary if the use of an application like fdisk fails.

   Try cfdisk. It's an ncurses version of fdisk that lets you see what you
have and what you're doing.

Subject: [PLUG] More detailed info than what is on man pages - where?
Message-ID: <4F3C219F.7040406@pcnetinc.com>

Someone from another list (and continent ;) is helping me 
with a problem.

Has suggested that I use two commands from a terminal session:
   $ dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc
   $ sudo grub-install /dev/sda

He has shut down for the night and I wish to do some 
research while I wait for his reply tomorrow.

I'm looking for finer grain information on dpkg-reconfigure 
and sudo grub-install than given by the man pages.

I'm using Ubuntu 10.10 (GRUB version 1.98)
I've search ubuntu.com, debian.org, and some Google searches.
I can find "current info" or "detailed info" but not 
"current detail info".
[and the detailed info only hints at what I'm looking for - 
some even explicitly states that it does not address my 
environment]

I think this is the type of search I should be able to do, 
but I don't yet grok the Linux mindset.

TIA

This strikes me as a kind of thing you learn by doing, not by lurking.
I wonder if there is not some open source project out there where your
friend might not add some specific value to the project and might as a
result also learn about the collaborative process.

If push comes to shove and you remain unsure of your options, you 
might try using Clonezilla (or directly use one of its consitutent 
utilities like Partclone) to get an image of each of the partitions 
you'd like to save. Then you can nuke the existing partition table and 
restore your images.

It's actually a third (or fourth) had connection. From what I understand 
the consultant has only a moderate level of technical acquaintance, and 
not a programmer. Still, there might be some role working on 
documentation or such. I'll pass that idea along.

Dick,

   I think you can find some good ideas on collaborative working on the Web
and pass those on to the management consultant. There are probably also
books written on the subject.

                        Open Data and Interoperability

                                      by

                                 Arlo Belshee


Lots of us want to expose our data via RESTful web APIs. We also want to 
consume data exposed via such APIs. REST + Json works well for this. 
However, we'd also like to mash up multiple data sources and build 
higher level tools. For example, it would be nice to create Business 
Intelligence (BI) tools that can point to any API and start charting the 
data, or create JavaScript control libraries that can be bound directly 
to data sources.

Unfortunately, that isn't possible with just REST + Json.

The problem is that each service is custom. No two services follow 
exactly the same rules. Sure, everything exposes sets of resources. But 
how do you get from a resource to its related resources? How do you ask 
the server to tell you about related resources? What, exactly should the 
server do when it gets a PATCH verb? Each server interprets these 
differently, which prevents making general tools.

I'm going to talk about the OData protocol. This is an open standard 
that defines uniform semantics and modeling for RESTful web services. 
I'll show how this allows general tools to be built, and data from 
multiple sources to be combined together in interesting ways - without 
requiring custom code for each server. I'll also show how this enables 
people working in different languages. A single library can be written 
for each language which can then support all OData-compliant RESTful web 
services.

Most of the examples will be with open source frameworks and tools, but 
I'll also show ways that you can use OData to break out data that is 
trapped in closed-source systems and expose it to the open source ecosystem.

     *******************************************************************

         Agenda:

             7:00 - 7:30  Business
                  We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects
                  including PLUG's monthly Advanced Topics meetings,
                  PLUG's monthly hands on clinics etc.

Another option would be to view the discussion tabs for any article at Wikipedia

Subject: [PLUG] Virtualbox locks up computer
Message-ID: <20120215195251.3c25a103@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Fedora 16, x86_64 on Thinkpad T61 using nVidia drivers. All updates
applied.

I require Virtualbox to run Windows 2000 in which I run Quickbooks. I
need to run it only once every couple of weeks, but when I need it I
really need it.

Today I launched Virtualbox, which came up without error. I tried to
start the Windows 2000 machine (which always worked flawlessly before),
and got a dialog box that said:

	Failed to open a session for the virtual machine Windows 2000.
	The virtual machine 'Windows 2000' has terminated unexpectedly
	during startup because of signal 9. 

The first time I tried this there was a "details" button that offered
additional information, none of which was in English, just stuff that a
programmer might understand. I did not copy it down. I decided to
Google on the problem and got a Google page open, then the entire
computer hung - no keyboard, no mouse. There were no flashing lights. I
had to hit the power button. In three years of running Fedora I have
run into issues, but I have never had the computer hang completely.

Upon restarting I tried again. This time I was able to write down the
above error message, but when I tried to click on the details button to
copy down the additional information the computer had hung again.

Upon restarting I opened Yumex first and applied all available updates
(33 of them), then rebooted. After rebooting I tried Virtualbox again,
and this time it hung as soon as I selected "Windows 2000" and hit the
Start button; I never even got the above error message.

I also have Windows XP installed as a virtual machine. Trying to start
it locks up the computer the same as the Windows 2000 machine.

Fortunately, everything else works just fine, as before.

I posted this morning on the Fedora forums. So far 95 people have
viewed my post, but no suggestions. I am out of ideas and I really need
to print an invoice so I can ship an order. Any suggestions welcome!

Never mind how it works, what does it do?

Can't Google for punctuation, not in the Bash references I searched, the thread about web searching for punctuation
isn't findable via search engine.

So it's up to Plug and its repository of knowledge.

You could try booting Windows 2000 into safe mode. That could give you some
idea of what is going wrong.

Message-ID: <20120215214808.24d3e0c1.johnxj@comcast.net>

OK, now I,ve done it. My Thinkpad T61 with Fedora 16, x86_64 hangs at the Thinkpad splash screen. It says "To interrupt normal startup, press the blue ThinkVantage button." From past experience, pressing this button takes me to the BIOS configuration page, but now it does nothing. It just hangs, no flashing lights, nada.

This occurred while rebooting the umpteenth time today. The reason for the reboots is that I have been trying to get Virtualbox running again. For my most recent exercise I uninstalled 3.2 and installed 4.1 with Yumex. These are the Oracle versions, not the OSE versions. Virtualbox launches fine, but when I try to start either of the Windows virtual machines the computer locks up. /var/log/messages is silent. 

I know nothing of BIOS problems. At the moment my main computer is dead and I need it back ASAP.

Virtualbox doesn't offer any such options. There is just a Start
button. Or at least, I couldn't find any way to launch Windows in safe
mode.

It's not a Virtualbox feature it's a Windows 2000 feature. You launch
normally with Virtualbox Start button and then follow the instructions  in

I have this problem on y Lenovo T61.

It seems to be heat related.

If I let it set. take the plug out and let it cool off, then I can boot it.
Leaving the plug in, seems to delay this considerably.

I take the battery out. I unplug it. I leave it for a bit until it is
cooled and then it boots again.

Seems strange, but It seems to make a difference.

Well, I no sooner than hit the Send button after typing that on my
desktop computer, and suddenly the Thinkpad started booting. Fedora
came up normally, and here I am. 

Obviously, the first thing I will do is a thorough backup, although I
have copies of everything important elsewhere. Corralling them all for
a reinstall would be a pain, where a complete backup would make things
simpler, as well as more secure.

But in the meantime I don't dare shut the computer down. Is something
wrong with my BIOS? How to test? Is it related to the Virtualbox
issues? How could a hang of the computer cause the BIOS not to be able
to find Grub, or whatever it finds to boot Linux?

Oh, I see. Unfortunately, Windows won't even start to the point where I
can use the startup options. Just clicking the Start button in
Virtualbox instantly locks up the computer. And the lockup occurs
whether I try to start my Windows 2000 or my Windows XP virtual
machine.

geez, i really wanted to be the one to answer this.  I've never used
the ampersand that way, and i though maybe (due to your quote) that it
was ash-specific, but no dice (thought the ash man page may be my new
sweetheart, it's less than 1/3 the length of bash(1) and is extremely
concise everywhere & is mentioned at least =))

but the best answer i found was from wikipedia, which merely expounded
upon the possibilities while maddeningly not expanding:

" In Bash, the ampersand can separate words, control the command
history, duplicate file descriptors, perform logical operations,
control jobs, and participate in Regular expressions. "

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand)

Sorry to frustrate you with my sloppy cut and paste and brain addled proofreading.
That should read:

   Bash continues to amaze me.

I know what & does in the general sense, and I suspect that &(...) forks off 
some processes from within a script. 

But

I don't _know_ what that does. Lack of punctuation based searching in impeding my efforts to look it up.
Having had to work last night (jobs are useful but sometimes ...) prevented me from experimenting.

So I asked.

As to what the root problem is, I like your heat theory. If it were me, I would clean out any ports, and possibly disassemble enough of the system to get at any fans to blow those out.

Have you looked in the VirtualBox log?

knowing virtually nothing about bash, I searched the Bash Reference
Manual.  I got 80 hits for & ; none for &( .  Does this apply? (I can
say that the Bash Reference Manual is as opaque as Bash itself.)

HISTIGNORE
A colon-separated list of patterns used to decide which command lines
should be saved on the history list. Each pattern is anchored at the
beginning of the line and must match the complete line (no implicit
?*? is appended). Each pattern is tested against the line after the
checks specified by HISTCONTROL are applied. In addition to the normal
shell pattern matching characters, ?&? matches the previous history
line. ?&? may be escaped using a backslash; the backslash is removed
before attempting a match. The second and subsequent lines of a
multi-line compound command are not tested, and are added to the
history regardless of the value of HISTIGNORE.
HISTIGNORE subsumes the function of HISTCONTROL. A pattern of ?&? is
identical to ignoredups, and a pattern of ?[ ]*? is identical to
ignorespace. Combining these two patterns, separating them with a
colon, provides the functionality of ignoreboth.

I know I've had load problems on my T410 when I've run Virtualbox...
might try getting a baseline before you try again, i.e. get the current
temp on your system with the following command.

cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM0/temperature

and of course for current load

John, I wonder if Virtualbox is locking up your system by overloading
your CPU.

Side bit, possibly unrelated -- I can't run Virtualbox and KVM
simultaneously.

Thanks,
Mike

I'd be curious to see this in the larger context? "&" be used as a control
character among other uses. There does exist the command ((...))

--enable-dparen-arithmeticInclude support for the ((...)) command (see
Conditional
Constructs<http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Conditional-Constructs>
).

Single parens usually denote an expression "(value)" with a used in a test
utility. But the "..." is what really throws me. This is generally used as
a symbolic reference in describing BASH commands such as  name=(value1 ...
valuen).

Whatever the command syntax does, it seems to not be very highly
referenced...

Yep. First thing I looked at. The only logs that exist are for previous
instances where I launched the virtual machines. Evidently it locks up
the computer so fast that no new log is generated. :(

Ditto for /var/log/messages.

True reconciliation is never cheap, for it is based on forgiveness, which
is costly. Forgiveness in turn depends on repentance, which has to be
based on an acknowledgment of what was done wrong, and therefore on
disclosure of the truth. You cannot forgive what you do not know.
Archbishop Tutu

Can't rule out the heat theory, but last night when it finally booted
one of the first things I did was run Palimpsest. It reported zero
errors on the hard disk, not even any sectors that had been
reallocated, and the temperature of the drive was 32C. That doesn't
mean the CPUs weren't overheated, but it makes it seem less likely. As
I recall the laws of thermodynamics, stuff gets hot all over. I don't
remember the details, however. :(

It's still running fine, although the backup I did last night is acting
weird. I started it about 11 pm, it is just now noon, and it is
still running. That's wrong. Shouldn't take more than 2-3 hours.

Have you tried transferring one of the VM's to another computer running a
compatible (or same) VM "manager" (VirtualBox, etc.)?

This would potentially serve 2 purposes:
1) Verify that the VM itself is not the problem - more precisely, it would
act as a data point to help you draw conclusions/narrow down where the
problem may exist (it wouldn't necessary rule anything 100% "out", or "in").
2) Give you a way of using/accessing your critical apps/data while you work
to get things working as desired again.

Also... you might want to build a quick-and-dirty NEW VM (from standard
install media/iso)... just as another data point in isolating the problem.

Just some thoughts.

Subject: [PLUG] Manually stop a shell script
Message-ID: <20120216121638.7bceca52@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I run rdiff-backup from a simple shell script with an external text
file of excluded folders. Even if I haven't run it for a long time it
never takes more than 2-3 hours to do everything. That is, it backs up
200 GB of data on the laptop hard disk to a 500 GB hard disk in the
Ultrabay (where the CD drive normally lives). 

I want to terminate the backup from the command line, but I have no
idea what command to use. Quit? Exit? Stop? Halt? Stop-already? I could
just eject the destination media, but I'd rather stop the backup as
gracefully as possible. 

Of course, after I stop the script, I want to inspect the destination
media to see what it actually did, then probably restart the backup.
When I do so I would like to add a -verbose switch into the script so I
can better see what it's doing. But I don't want to see everything, just
main events. The rdiff-backup man page is not helping me here.

Also, there is are a couple of error messages generated at 1:30 am
today that say the same thing, e.g.:

SpecialFileError dev/log Socket error: AF_UNIX path too long

And here is the script:

#!/bin/bash
sudo rdiff-backup
--include-globbing-filelist /home/jjj/rdiff_excludes.txt / /media/Backups/Full_system_backup_Fedora
	2> /home/jjj/rdiff-errors.txt 
sudo rdiff-backup
--list-increment-sizes /media/Backups/Full_system_backup_Fedora
	> /home/jjj/rdiff-stats.txt

Suggestions?

Good ideas. I have Virtualbox on my desktop (Lucid, x86_64). The VMs
are about 9 GB, so it wouldn't be too much trouble to copy them to the
desktop. 

However, it seems doubtful that the problem is in the VM because there
are two of them (Windows 2000 and Windows XP), and I get the same
lockup with both. 

But still good ideas.

maybe its not the VM's themselves but the Virtualbox build/software?

Are there any USB or other types of devices trying to load at boot?
Perhaps try disabling all of those in settings.

Good thinking.
I suspect that it's some sort of hinkiness (probably hardware) in your
Thinkpad.  Running a VM is a big job that uses RAM and CPU heavily, and
thus is more likely to trigger problems.

First guess: bad RAM.  Second guess: CPU or chipset heatsink has come
loose.  FreeGeek Store has 2GB DDR2 SODIMMs for your laptop, they might let
you do a test-swap.

Unless it's running in the background, you should be able to use Control-C.
If that doesn't work, I use Control-Z (puts it in the background and gives
you a shell) and then type "kill %1".  After that, I can type "fg" (bring
the background task back to foreground) and it will usually stop.

Alternately, you can open another terminal, then type
"ps ax | grep rdiff-backup" - this will usually show process information
about 2 things - your rdiff-backup process, and the grep process you just
started.  The first number is the process's ID number, or PID.  You can
then tell the process to stop by using "kill [PID]".  If you want to be
more forceful about it, you can use "kill -9 [PID]", or if the pricess is
running as root, "sudo kill [-9] [PID]"

Have fun,

Subject: [PLUG] Cheap asterisk hardware?
Message-ID: <20120216225732.GC20633@kailarose.respond2.com>

Since I haven't gone and started a VoIP group yet, I'll ask here.
I'm hoping to bring my wife's office phones gently into the 21st century,
which means I need a way to interface at least 3 POTS lines and 5 analog
cordless phones to an Asterisk server.

I would like to test them out on it first, so before I go and drop $600 on
a PCI line card or analog gateways, any ideas on cheap or loaner options?

I really like the looks of the Sangoma Vega 50 - it has a power-fail mode
where the first 2 FXS ports are conencted to the 2 FXO ports.

?or, perhaps a dconfiguration has gotten corrupted. Can you move/rename

one of your existing disk images?

You might want to set the default power mode to "max battery" and/or tweak
the CPU utilization level in the BIOS to the lowest level - both will help
control cooling.  I've got an old T23 and I almost never hear the fan spin
up with the forementioned settings.

If it's bad hardware, then the existing hardware has failed. I can say
that with certainty because I never had a problem with either VM in the
past. Therefore, the hardware has always been adequate. The computer has
4GB of RAM, and I allocated only 1 GB to each of the VMs, and I have
never run more than one at a time. The hard disk is 320 GB, with about
100 GB free space. And as for heat, I wasn't doing anything serious
with the computer at the time I tried launching the VM. Plus, I tried
again after doing the latest updates and rebooting; in other words, I
had nothing at all running and I still got a lockup when trying to start
the VM.

The issue of the BIOS hanging is likely unrelated to the VM hangups. I
doubt that it is heat, but there are other possibilities. The VM
hangups are more likely due to some software incompatibility.

You might check out Rowetel.com (http://www.rowetel.com/blog/?page_id=445).
I have one of their IP0X embedded systems.  It was much less expensive than
the Digium solution.  It will support up to 8 POTS connectors, split between
FXO and FXS on even-numbered boundaries.

My only mistake: I blew over any consideration of upgrading the firmware
first.  The supplied version of Asterisk is pretty old and the shell is
quirky if you need to do scripting.  The site discusses flashing the device
with newer software, and I probably should have done that before I went into
production.  Still, I'm happy with the box.

Or

   pkill rdiff-backup

Or, more severely

   pkill -9 rdiff-backup
   pkill -KILL rdiff-backup

I like the second form because it makes me think about the signal I 
really want to send. It's easier to transpose digits, rending "-9" as 
something unwanted.

At the risk of unleashing a fire hose of responses, what do people recommend
for blogging software?

My requirements:
- I'll be running on a current Linux system (OpenSUSE 12.1).
- I don't need a lot of fancy bells and whistles
- I'll be running on a fairly lightweight machine (32 bit, dual core
hyper-threaded, 1.5Ghz, 2G memory)
- I expect light traffic.  If I get 30 hits a day other than spiders I'll be
pleased.
- I want something that's not too bleeding edge.  Reliability is important.
- Reasonably secure -- at least not a long history of exposures.

Recommendations?

Octopress.

It uses github to host very nice-looking blog content, external
webservices for things like comments, and all the actual hosted
content is static, so there's nothing to exploit other than spamming
via comments, if you have comments enabled via eg: discus.

http://octopress.org/

I used to run wordpress and movabletype, but they were both /far/ more
effort to maintain than I wanted to deal with.  I've also been
blogging on blogspot for a while now (6 years), and I'd recommend
blogspot for media-heavy blogs, but it's hasn't been good for code
samples or other technical content.

Hello from Alaska

Given the ((...)),
the dot-dot-dot represents an algebraic type math expression.
Remove quotes in expressions below.
Normally you can't have an expression in bash of the sort "a*5%3" (e.g. a
times 5 modulo 3).
An alternate form is "let b=a/3"
Look for "let" under Bash built-ins in the referenced Bash manual.
This lets you not have to use "expr" for computations.

Depends on what sort of blog it is. But I'll put in a pitch for Wordpress,
which I've used on a number of blog for more than seven years. Been very
happy with it. The more recent versions have been getting ever easier to
install and work with, and they're very flexible - it'll accommodate most
any kind of blog. And it has a huge user base and user community, so there
are plenty of resources available.

Not exactly.  If I'm reading correctly, there is not any special 
construct '&(...)' -- it just backgrounds the commands before the & and 
runs a subshell of the () part.  It's the same thing as '& (...)' 
c.f. '; (...)', which seems not as interesting as '$(...)', '<(...)', 
or '>(...)' I think.

I did run across coproc while reading though and now need to find a 
chance to use that.

without more context, it's hard to say what Mr. Riviera was complaining
about. I would start with that all variables should be quoted whenever
possible. mkdir -p "$var"

if this were used in a script, perhaps one enabled for a user via sudo, you
could create a serious security hole by not quoting your variable.

it's better not to worry about whether it's dangerous in this instance or
that one or not but maybe a little or what if I'm the only user but maybe
someday this could go somewhere with more exposure... just quote it every
time. :)

it's also possible that the complainer did not think that was the most
optimal solution to mr-green06's problem. if we knew what that was, we
might be able to offer more insight.

I don't recall ever seeing this mentioned on the list.  Looks interesting.

"Try out namebench. It hunts down the fastest DNS servers available
for your computer to use. namebench runs a fair and thorough benchmark
using your web browser history, tcpdump output, or standardized
datasets in order to provide an individualized recommendation.
namebench is completely free and does not modify your system in any
way. This project began as a 20% project at Google."

Ha! Much as I had suspected and why I asked to see it's use in the larger
context as it was indeed a "syntax reference" not an actual command, "&(
... )" that someone saw being used in functional script.

The <( ... ) syntax creates a temporary named pipe which makes the stdout
of thesort | tr commands look and behave like a file, allowing diff to
operate on the expected type of input.

issues related to running FreeNAS on 32-bit repurposed hardware. We 
toured its user interface and explored its status information from a 
system administrator's perspective.

This month we will look at this issues relating to building your own 
64-bit new hardware system and explore ZFS resource usage.

As before, you are welcome to bring various client machines to 
interrogate and hopefully pound on FreeNAS with.

Bring your own food and drink.

See you there!

I was curious so I tried namebench. It's great!

A while ago it seemed that my ISP's DNS servers were slow, seemingly
referring a lot of my DNS queries to higher level servers repeatedly,
so I installed dnsmasq as a caching nameserver on my desktop machine.

Running namebench confirmed that there are faster DNS servers that I
can place in front of my ISP's primary DNS (Google and OpenDNS) so I
have done that. Now dnsmasq finds my habitual website haunts at 0 ms
and all my other website lookups average under 40 ms, or 150% faster.

Thanks, Galen!

This is entertaining and informative.  
I opted for sharing my anonimized results, you can see thm at 
   http://namebench.appspot.com/id/6284106

The entertaining part:  Google Public DNS (the famous 8.8.8.8) is noted
as "google.com apears incorrect."  And PayPal is hijacked?

   This morning my inbox contained a message from root generated when the
hourly cron job ran at 4:00am:

/home/rshepard/shell-scripts/ngetip.sh: line 4: [: !=: unary operator expected

   Here are the first few lines of the script:

NEWIP=$(curl -s http://automation.whatismyip.com/n09230945.asp) 
if [ $NEWIP != $OLDIP ];  then
     echo $OLDIP
     echo $NEWIP

   This script has run for the past week plus without generating any errors.
Looking in my ORA bash shell book the syntax for an if statement (using
brackets to deliniate the if condition) seems correct. What might have
caused this message to be generated?

In my experience, this usually means one of the variables wasn't set. 

Assuming the /home/rshepard/CURRENTIP file exists, then I would assume curl was unable to connect to the URL given. This would cause $NEWIP to not be set, and the test condition to fail.

Look at your inputs. What happens if curl returns something with no data or
with random data in it. Especially if it has punctuation in it.

Russell,

   OK. CURRENTIP does exist. Even if curl could not connect to the URL why
generate an error message about expecting a unary operator for the !=?

John,

   Good question. I suppose then that bash scratches its head and returns
anything as an error message since there's no default else condition.

Because, unfortunately, when curl returns nothing (as it dose on error
with -s) then $NEWIP is also set to nothing, which (due to the way
bash behaves -- badly, IMHO) causes that left hand argument to *go
away*.  eg:

if [ $NEWIP != $OLDIP ];

turns into somthing like:

if [  != $OLDIP ];

Quoting $NEWIP in the conditional will probably fix this.  eg:

if [ "$NEWIP" != "$OLDIP" ];

so you at least end up with:

if [ "" != "$OLDIP" ];

which still makes some sense.

Subject: [PLUG] Partition table editing
Message-ID: <1329592766.32117.YahooMailNeo@web120804.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Previously I mentioned difficulties I had with an inconsistent partition table that prevented me from using gparted. I fixed it and then made it worse again; at present it looks like this:

Disk /dev/sdb: 1000.2 GB, 1000204886016 bytes
104 heads, 52 sectors/track, 361228 cylinders, total 1953525168 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0xa8a8a8a8

?? Device Boot????? Start???????? End????? Blocks?? Id? System
/dev/sdb2?????? 235352062?? 782227455?? 273437697??? 5? Extended
/dev/sdb5?????? 235352064?? 245116927???? 4882432?? 82? Linux swap / Solaris
/dev/sdb6?????? 245118976?? 293956512??? 24418768+? 83? Linux
/dev/sdb7?????? 293947392?? 782243003?? 244147806?? 83? Linux

I was able to see in in gparted until I used Partition Table Doctor (a Windows application) on it. PTD noted slight gaps between some of the partitions (logical) and offered to "correct" this. What I have now is sdb7 going slightly beyond the end of sdb2 (the extended partition) and sdb6 and sdb7 also overlapping slightly. Exactly how could I fix this? I know that fdisk doesn't make permanent changes before "w" is issued. Do you have to delete all the partitions before re-creating the table? Or can you just change the offending one? Changing sdb7 alone, at both ends, would correct the overlap. Also, I note that in no case is there a gap of only one sector from one partition to the next. How large should it be, and how accurately do you have to estimate it?

The error doesn't happen until the 'if' statement. The curl command fails silently, leaving $NEWIP unset because there was no return value. 

When the variable is unset then you are asking if something is not equal to an unset variable. This causes the error because it doesn't handle that case. It's like saying "2 != ", and bash goes, "huh? 2 is not equal to WHAT???" It's missing a required operator for that operation.

The only problem I see with this is then the script could try to set DNS to an empty string. It wouldn't handle transient errors well. 

As it is, the script fails, and DNS remains the same.

At least, I think that's what may happen.

Message-ID: <CAArUT0gAzyf1TV1HtTiPbnra5LseCMyKvGaXfqkHY-KEcVVOgw@mail.gmail.com>

I did something stupid. Yesterday (Saturday) evening a window popped
up saying someone wanted to log in.  I permitted it thinking it was my
son.  Within two minutes I found out that it was not he, so I shut
down.

This morning I perused the logs (network off).  I found that on Friday
the auth.log shows many (over 300) messages such as:

23.19.81.173.rdns.ubiquity.io [23.19.81.173] failed - POSSIBLE BREAK-IN ATTEMPT!
Feb 17 16:56:10 R2D4 sshd[2649]: Invalid user rookie from 23.19.81.173
Feb 17 16:56:16 R2D4 sshd[2651]: reverse mapping checking getaddrinfo
for 23.19.81.173.rdns.ubiquity.io [23.19.81.173] failed - POSSIBLE
BREAK-IN ATTEMPT!

Where "rookie" changed to many different names.

Background: On Friday I changed from DSLnorthwest to Comcast.  The
Comcast installation was completed just before noon on Friday.  When
the tech set up the machine he attempted to install some software, but
he said it failed.  He said they have software for Windows and Mac.  I
wonder if anything nasty was stuck on the machine at that time, of if
Comcast was attempting to do the failed installation.

Advice?

Denis,

   Almost every morning my ssh logs show cracking attempts: invalid user, bad
password, reverse mapping failures, attempts to log in as postfix, dovecot,
etc. I ignore them since they all failed. All I look for are ssh logins that
succeeded: mine from my portable and my partner when we're sharing data.

   Some days the log shows tens-of-thousands of attempts by script kiddies
using password dictionaries and lists of login names. In 15 years no
unauthorized user has cracked our network.

I'll suggest, again, using iptables to cut down the number of attempts. 
  I use a recipe that starts dropping the connection attempts after 3 
failed in one minute.  I also provides a free pass to (no timeout for 
failed attempts) for specific IP addresses or IP address ranges.

Two issues (one I haven't taken the time to resolve) are:
    1) if you get hit by a bot/zombie net you'll get a pile of different 
attempts and if they retry several times or
    2) they use a paced attack you'll see more than 3 attempts in the 
logs. (Because there are several max-3 attempts for the days logs.

Yes security by obscurity (use a different port) helps but I've seen 
probes that run through a pile of high level ports until they find some 
that answers as ssh then a flood of attempts on that port.  You're back 
to square one.

If there is any interest I can post an anonymized version.

I have heard this before from many people.  But this is the first time
it has happened to me.  It must be that the dsl connection was not
attractive to hackers.

Does this imply that the login attempt message I received was of a
different sort of attack?  My modem (not a router) has wireless that I
cannot turn off.

Denis,

   _I_ don't think so. What's most important is that every attempt to crack
into your system/network via ssh fails. We can no more eliminate these
attempts than we can eliminate spam.

I've been runnin SSH on several Internet-facing servers, and
used to get hundreds, if not thousands, of these messages in
the logs.  I finally got tired of this and moved my SSH server
to a different port (such as 12345 -- not what I use :-), and
now NEVER get these.

For added security, I long ago disabled password-based logins
and accept only public-key authentication.

Recognize that breakin attempts will happen, use good passwords, sleep easy.

Install something like fail2ban 
  http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Fail2ban:Community_Portal
to reduce log file clutter and lower the chance of your attacker getting lucky.

I think the core of my question is what is the likely result of my
saying YES to the login request?  I appreciate the advice on keeping
the machine secure and keeping the bad guys out, but right now my
concern is that a bad guy has already gotten in.  If not, then I can
see about keeping them out.  If yes, how do I know and what do I do to
send him away?  I am taking my machine off-line all the time now,
except to occasionally read and send messages like this one.

Thanks,

   I would not. Set up the host to accept logins only from authorized users
(e.g., your son and yourself). Using ssh from the remote host enter
password/passphrase and the user is authenticated against /etc/shadow. No
action on your part required.

   There are tools available to check whether you've been rooted but I've not
had need for any so others can better advise you.

Use `last | less` and see who actually logged in when you did the approval, 
then see what they did while logged on.

For instance, mine looks like:

   michael  pts/3        shed.jamhome.us  Sun Feb 19 13:29   still logged in   
   michael  pts/0        shed.jamhome.us  Sun Feb 19 10:28   still logged in   
   gritton  pts/3        c-174-52-130-208 Mon Feb 13 21:53 - 21:53  (00:00)    
   michael  pts/1        shed.jamhome.us  Mon Feb 13 15:50   still logged in   
   michael  pts/0        hive.michaelsnet Sun Feb 12 05:16 - 06:10  (00:53)    
   gritton  pts/0        c-174-52-133-59. Sun Feb  5 19:15 - 19:16  (00:01)    
   michael  pts/4        shed.jamhome.us  Sun Feb  5 05:14 - 05:33  (00:19)    
   
   wtmp begins Sun Feb  5 05:14:05 2012

There's me logging in from two other hosts on the local net and (Jamie) Gritton
logging in for a minute or so once a week.

Alternatively you can examine /var/log/auth.log for the time you're intested
in and see if you approved an ftp, ssh or ____? login

   Well, I built and installed weechat, but the extensive documents haven't
helped me figure out how to connect to freenode#ubuntu-us-or. I try examples
from the help screen only to see that I'm not permitted to type in that

Everyone (including John and Keith who tried to get wireless working at the
clinic today):

   I have it running!!! Well, it's up and recognizes the neighborhood
networks, including ours. I found a blog page that showed the problem and
the fix. Turns out that running rfkill told me there's another driver with a
soft lock on the radio: acer_wmi. Removing that from the loaded modules
'modprobe -r acer_wmi' and blacklisting that module solved the problem.

   The one remaining ubuntu issue with which I need help is getting the
system to 'reach' the network. I entered a bunch of local IP addresses with
host names in /etc/hosts, and edited /etc/resolv.conf but to no avail. Tried
'/etc/init.d/networking restart' but that did no good either.

   When I try to ping a host on the local network, or one outside, I see
'network is unreachable.' What do I do to fix this?

TIA,

Rich

   I learned about Setup->Network Connections and entered the host IP
address, netmask, and gateway IP address. Restarted the system. Still cannot
ping anyone.

   I also entered the PSK for the Linksys WL-520GC in the configuration for
our network. Still no joy.

   No idea what I'm missing here.

Rich,

Running Ubuntu, the network-manager does not setup as a static ip 
addresss well.  I have installed wicd and have no problems with it.  
Everything looks good when I fill in all the blanks.  The computer hooks 
up to my network, but can't ping or access anything.  I am not sure if 
this falls under the Xubuntu problem, but thought I would mention it 
just in case.

Bruce,

   Yes, I installed wicd on the older Toshiba. Guess I can see if that's
still available.

   It wasn't working DHCP, either. That's why I entered the static IP
address. Neither of us cares which works as long as one does.

   Yep. That did the trick. Hooked up the ethernet cable and installed wicd
(and my favorite small editor, joe). Wireless works flawlessly now.
Connected to local network, pings another host and external site.

Evan is logged on as I type.  He has found out that Vino (the VNC
server) does not generate any log entries, and that is what he
suspects generated the window that I said yes to.  He has changed
thing so that Vino will not work.  And I will get a router real soon
now to keep out the creeps.

Thanks so much for your help.

Hi PLUGers.

I was doing some routine maintenance on my Debian box and I noticed that
the Linux kernel is now up to version 3.2---and version 3.0 was released
less than 6 months ago. Has there been a fundamental shift in the
nomenclature of the kernel version numbers? Previously, all even numbered
minor releases were stable releases while all odd-numbered minor releases
were development / bleeding-edge releases. But now a kernel version 3.1 is
marked as being *stable* on http://www.kernel.org! If there has been a
change in the version numbering scheme,  could someone bring me up to speed
on what the new version numbering scheme is?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Hi everyone.

I have recently noticed that for the last few months none of the replies /
questions that I've been "sending" using Thunderbird have been being posted
to the PLUG mailing list, yet when I use Gmail, everything works just fine.

Could anyone give me some ideas as to what could be causing this rather
annoying issue? Thanks in advance for your help!

   I read not long ago that Linus and the kernel development team did make 
changes, but I did not pay attention to the rationale. You can probably find
the explanation on kernel.org or with a Web search.

the last message I see from you before today is Jan. 29. Have you been
sending stuff since then?

based on your confusion, I assume you haven't been receiving bounces. Can
you send an email directly to me (wes at the-wes.com) from your thunderbird
and I'll see if I can figure out what the PLUG list server might have a
problem with?

I've seen similar problems with Thunderbird.  It seems to be related to
the 'Reply-To' header looking like this -

Reply-To: "General Linux/UNIX discussion and help;
	civil and on-topic" <plug at lists.pdxlinux.org>

It seems to confuse Thunderbird, which, at least for me, construct
an incorrect address when it tries to send the email. I noticed that
if I change the semi-colon (';') to a dash ('-') it seems to work just
fine.

Here's a sample email sent from Thunderbird using a simplified PLUG

I believe I have encountered this as well but had not taken time to 
investigate.  I removed all the quoted text and the messages go through.

Well, I just got an ack from the PLUG mailman server, so that seems to 
have solved the problem.

If I didn't have other more pressing things to do today, I might go and 
check out the Thunderbird source code to see what could be causing 
Thunderbird to choke up here...

Yes, there was a change. Version 3.0 marked the 20th anniversery of the 
Linux
kernel, and then they dropped part of the numbering pattern.

Under 2.6 each new release was 2.6.x. The stable-release team would 
extend that
to 2.6.x.y for their releases.

Starting with 3.0 each new release is 3.x (or 3.x.0) and the 
stable-release team
gets the third part for their use. So no more four-part version 
numbers.

The even/odd stable/development release numbering scheme went out
the window starting with the 2.6 series of kernels.  Now,
development releases are marked "-rc<number>".  Stable releases
have regular version numbers, without the "-rc" tag.

The header contains a  List-Id entry that that has the text containing

I don't have any more time to investigate, unfortunately.

Denis - This is a brute force scripted attack on the well-known SSH port.
Any system that has a public ip address is very likely to see this type of
activity.

The only way you can say "YES" to the login request is if the SSH password
is guessed. So as someone mentioned use a strong password and change it
every now and then.

There's also the practice of port knocking.
http://www.marksanborn.net/linux/add-port-knocking-to-ssh-for-extra-security/


Routinely looking through your logs and running malware checks is a good
way to know if a bad guy has gotten in because that's what scripted attacks
do. They're looking for easy openings to install software to zombify your
machine for a botnet.

Unless you have some really valuable information on this computer it's
highly unlikely that it's a target attack by highly skilled cracker (bad
guy)...

Using the big, public namservers can have unwanted effects on traffic
from CDNs, such as Akamai, etc.

Since many of these CDNs source their traffic from caches "proximate"
to the DNS server used to resolve the hostnames, using a nameserver
not proximate to the actual downloader can be sub-optimal. Google has
provided a proposal (edns-client-subnet) for resolving this:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vandergaast-edns-client-ip-00

The namebench tool is pretty neat!

Last month we discussed the history of FreeNAS as a BSD project and the 
issues related to running FreeNAS on 32-bit repurposed hardware. We 
toured its user interface and explored its status information from a 
system administrator's perspective.

This month we will look at this issues relating to building your own 
64-bit new hardware system and explore ZFS resource usage.

As before, you are welcome to bring various client machines to 
interrogate and hopefully pound on FreeNAS with.

Bring your own food and drink.

See you there!

   Running cfdisk on a new machine. There are 3 partitions: sda1 is 300G,
sda2 is 8G swap, and sda3 is 192G. There's an asterisk next to the size on
sda3; what does this mean?

   When the installation disk asks to format each partition and I select the
quick check with ext3 as the filesystem, sda1 completes very quickly but
sda3 takes a very long time. It's as though a quick format cannot be done on
this partition. Is this related to the asterisk after the size?

 From the man page for cfdisk (from Fedora 15)

If a partition does not start or end on a cylinder boundary or
if the partition length is not divisible by the cylinder size,
an asterisk (*) is printed after the non-aligned sector num?
ber/count. This usually indicates that a partition was created
by an operating system that either does not align partitions to
cylinder boundaries or that used different disk geometry infor?
mation. If you know the disk geometry of the other operating
system, you could enter the geometry information with the change
geometry command (g).

According to the cfdisk(8) man page, the asterisk means that the
partition is not aligned on a cylinder boundary.  I'm not sure that's
really important these days.  If you need a DOS partition, perhaps,
but Linux doesn't care.

This shouldn't be related to the partition alignment at all.  Other
than that, I'm not sure what to say.  What do you mean by "quick
format"?  mke2fs(8)'s run time depends mostly on the size of the
partition, unless you're running with the -c (bad blocks check)
option.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no "quick format"
option.  There is the "-S" option, but that only reinitializes the
superblocks and group descriptors, it doesn't do anything else.

Dale,

   Yes, I saw this.

   Slackware allows a quick format that does not check for bad blocks. When I
specify that for sda1 mounted on /, control returns immediately. When I
specify that for sda3 mounted on /home, there's the usualy delay as the fs
is installed on the partition.

   Think I need to check for bad blocks on sda1 because I get the error of
insufficient disk space on sda1 and that should not be the case.

Thanks,

Rich

Hrm, yeah, you probably should.  It takes time to format a partition,
so control should never return immediately.  Especially in your case,
where sda1 is 300Gig.  That's going to take time to format, regardless
of whether you're checking for bad blocks or not.

As a test, you could try hooking this disk into your regular system.
Then you could do the formatting directly from the command line, and
see how long things take.  Just to see if the installer is ignoring an
error or something.  You can also set mke2fs to be verbose, and it'll
give you all sorts of info while it works.

Dale,

   That's why I kept repeating the fdisk partitioning.

   It's a 2.5" portable drive. What I suspect is that the original win7 did
something funky to the beginning of the hard drive that xubuntu ignored when
I installed that but which catches slackware. I'm re-installing xubuntu (or,
at least, running it without installation) to see if I can identify what
happened to the hard drive.

Thanks,

Rich

Ah, okay, I didn't realize this was for your laptop.  Yeah,
Windows can do some odd things, sometimes.  But if you've
re-written the partition table that shouldn't be a problem.  It
sounds to me like something created a really small filesystem in
sda1, rather than the full 300 Gig partition.  Why this would
happen, I don't know -- I'm just guessing, here.

BTW, you might want to invest in one of those little 2.5" hard
drive enclosures that hook up to USB.  That way you could check
the drive from your regular system, without having to open it up.
:-)  I highly recommend them, especially if you've got a laptop.

They aren't terribly expensive, given that there's no hard drive
included.  And they're really quite handy for external storage.
(For instance, I keep my music collection on one.)  Granted, USB
isn't terribly fast, but you wouldn't be using it for main mass
storage anyway.  And, depending on the drive that you use, you can
actually power it directly off of the USB, without needing an
external power supply.

Dale,

   I think you've made a very good guess.

   I have a unit that lets me attach 3.5", 2.5" and SATA drives to a USB
port. But, I ain't gonna' take apart the new laptop.

   For the past 3/4-hour the laptop's been formatting sda1 checking for bad
blocks. I re-partitioned it so sda1 (/) is 200G at ext3, sda2 (swap) is
100M, and sda3 (/home) is 299G of ext3. I'm sure the latter will run
overnight. :-)

   As long as sda1 is formatted and ext3 is put on it I am confident that
there will be sufficient room for the OS. I switched from Red Hat to
Slackware in 2003 and this is the first time I've had a new drive tell me
there's insufficient space to load the OS.

300 Gig is *oodles* of space for your system.  Heck, 30 Gig is
plenty.  I have a 34 Gig partition for my laptop's system (Fedora
16), and I'm using just under half of it.  The rest of the 100 Gig
drive goes to /home, /opt, /usr/local, and misc data storage.

Subject: [PLUG] Stupid apt-get problem
Message-ID: <20120224000925.53582f8c@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I am trying to install the latest Opera web browser on my Lucid x86_64
desktop computer. Currently Opera 9.20 is installed, which I did a long
time ago by downloading the .deb file and installing it with gDebi or
dpkg. 

This evening I downloaded the latest .deb (11.61) and tried to install
it. I got an error message that, although not very clear, led me to
believe that it could not be installed without first removing 9.20. I
also found instructions for adding the opera repository, which I did,
and now Opera 11.61 is listed in Synaptic. But trying to install it with
Synaptic results in the same error message. 

I can launch Opera 9.20 and it runs fine. But Opera 9.20 is not listed
in Synaptic. "Aptitude show opera" says there is no such package.
"Aptitude remove opera" says no packages are to be removed.

WTH? How do I get rid of 9.20? How is it that I can launch and run a
program that is not installed on the computer?

Jason,

You will probably have to use dpkg -l to find the exact Opera package 
name and dpkg -r %packagename% to remove it.

The command "apt-cache pkgnames | grep <pkgname>" command will list any
packages in the apt-cache that have that name.

e.g.

root at mc-sidux:~# apt-cache pkgnames | grep chrome
google-chrome-unstable
xserver-xorg-video-openchrome
google-chrome-beta
xserver-xorg-video-openchrome-dbg
google-chrome-stable

If by chance Opera isn't listed try using the "locate" or "mlocate" command.

e.g.

root at mc-sidux:~# locate opera
/lib/modules/2.6.32-2.slh.4-sidux-686/kernel/drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/dvb-usb-opera.ko
/usr/include/c++/4.4/parallel/set_operations.h
/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload/operator.so
/usr/share/icons/oxygen/16x16/actions/irc-operator.png
/usr/share/icons/oxygen/16x16/actions/irc-remove-operator.png

You may need to update  the locate database with the command "updatedb &"

If you find Opera directories and files you will have to remove them
manually.

You can also try apt-get install -f Opera and see if that will fix broken
package dependencies. Which sometimes happens in situations like these.

Good luck!







aptitude remebers which packages you deliberately installed and which have
been automatically installed to satisfy dependencies. Upon removal of a
package aptitude will remove those automatically installed packages to keep
your system tidy. apt-get isn't that smart.

aptitude will quickly become an indispensable tool once you use different
repositories with different versions of a package. Imagine you are working
with backports.org or inofficial repositories like debian-multimedia.org.
Then aptitude will show (at the bottom of the details page of a certain
package) the available version number and allow you to select one.
If you get into a situation where programs conflict due to such usage of
inofficial repositories you will see a "Broken: ..." display on the top.
You can type l~b (limit / flag / broken) and just get a list of packages
that conflict with each other. Makes it much easier to resolve the conflict
manually.

That's what I needed, the -l switch. I did

	sudo dpkg -l |grep opera

And it listed the package as opera-static. WTH? What were those Opera
people thinking? "Static"? Who would have guessed that? And note that
Synaptic never listed opera-static. At first it listed nothing, then
after enabling the special Opera repository it listed Opera 11.61. Very
strange.

Anyway, once I knew the name of the package "sudo dpkg -r opera-static"
got rid of it. And then "sudo aptitude install opera" found version
11.61 in the repository and added it. 

All is peaceful again in Lucid-land. Thanks for the hint. :)

you need to uninstall in (roughly) the same way that you originally
installed. since you didn't install opera via apt, you should not expect
apt to know about it or help you uninstall it.

And for further fun-
The "static" most likely means that the package is statically linked to the
required libraries, instead of relying on the ones installed on the system
(which would be dynamically linked), which could sometimes lead to version
conflicts.

Just my $0.02 :)

"There are two basic types of installations, static and shared:

*Static version*: Opera has the Qt library built in. It is a larger
download, and it does not use anti aliased fonts on menus or the file
chooser, and uses aliasing in the browser window and most other interface
elements.

*Shared version*: Opera uses the Qt installation on your system. It
integrates with the system, using whatever anti aliasing setting you have
for other Qt applications.

Which is better? Probably the Shared version. Try the other one if you run
into installation problems."

Explain why I should not expect apt to know about all packages
installed on the computer. You see, in my silly way I assumed that
whenever a package was installed, regardless of what package manager
installed it, it would then be listed in a central database file of
installed apps. Thus, all package managers would know about it. The
whole operating system would know about it. Menu editors would know
about it. Even (gasp!) the user of the computer would be able to find
out about it. There would be no confusion and fragmentation of function.

I don't doubt the truth of what you say. I just think that a package
manager that is not aware of all packages installed on the system is a
fail.

I don't know if I can, with any degree of sanity. If there were only one
package manager, this wouldn't be a problem. Different package managers
exist for a reason - no comment on whether this is a GOOD reason or not.

You see, in my silly way I assumed that

This is a fictional item.

Thus, all package managers would know about it.


Package managers maintain their own lists of things they've installed. it
wouldn't really be reasonable to expect one package manager to stay up to
date on all the latest from all the other managers. And then there's the
problem of applications installed without the use of a package manager.
Package managers are different for the same reason that different
distributions of Linux are different.

The "operating system" doesn't know or care about any packages that are
installed. It's not like there is a central "registry" where all the info
about everything is stored. This is why package managers were invented to
begin with.

Even (gasp!) the user of the computer would be able to find

I agree, the user is a very hard problem to solve.

There would be no confusion and fragmentation of function.

Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Maybe you expect too much.

According to 
http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkgtools.en.html <snip> 
'It is important to understand that the higher level package management 
tools such as aptitude or dselect rely on apt which, itself, relies on 
dpkg to manage the packages in the system.' </snip>

If I read this right, any software package 'installed' via aptitude / 
apt should be listed by dpkg.  At least on a Debian based machine.

I did qualify 'installed' because there are several programs and 
packages you simply unzip in a folder of choice and execute. Mozilla 
Firefox and Thunderbird on Debian Lenny / Squeeze / Wheezy / SID being 
two prime examples of unzip and execute.  Because they are not handled 
through a 'package manager' nobody would know of their existence.

Because the package manager is only going to know about the software you
installed with it as there's a difference when software
is installed from source (not a .deb or .rpm *package*) in which the user
may be required to sort out dependencies and conflicts verses
letting the package manager logic sort it out.

The level and complexity of the logic, the richness of features and keeping
the integrity of installed software intact are the reasons
package managers exist. Before then everything was installed / removed by
hand. How fun it must have been to be a Sys Admin then.

There is however a way to create a virtual package when installing from
source which would create a place holder in the package system inventory
which would allow you to search the package system for source installed
software and to also keep track of all the dependencies.

Do you mean the refresh button in the browser? If your browser is
Firefox, the refresh button is at the right end of the address bar.
Or you can just use Ctrl-r.

I have to take exception with previous statements about a lack of central
package tracking in debian-based distros. This is completely false. The
/var/lib/dpkg directory is used exactly for that purpose. This way all of
the apt-based (which as previously pointed out is all dpkg-based anyway)
can query any installed package and do stuff with it.

To prove it to yourself strace some dpkg or apt commands.
strace -o /tmp/dpkg.out dpkg -l >/dev/null && less /tmp/dpkg.out
strace -o /tmp/dpkg.out dpkg --get-selections >/dev/null && less
/tmp/dpkg.out
strace -o /tmp/dpkg.out apt-cache search chrome >/dev/null && less
/tmp/dpkg.out

You'll notice that with any of these commands that they open() and read()
/var/lib/dpkg/status among others files.

Cheers,

bd

Subject: [PLUG] Where'd my LibreOffice macro go?
Message-ID: <4F4BC141.1080908@comcast.net>

I ran an Ubuntu upgrade this morning. It included a number of things 
related to LibreOffice. I just started up a spreadsheet I use to track 
my time. The macro I created to insert the current date/time into a cell 
is gone. (The macro puts in the value of @now, copies it, pastes it back 
as the value.)

Is it normal for a program to eliminate a user macro as part of an upgrade?

   No. However, when LO upgraded from 3.4.x to 3.5.0 it lost the ability to
display recently opened documents. Oops! It's a bug and on the list of
things to be fixed in 3.5.1. How such a visible feature could be lost
puzzles me.

   Perhaps they trashed macros, too, in their hast to meet semi-annual
upgrade releases.

Sigh.

Well, I could have spent time rebuilding the macro (which really means 
spending time relearning how to build a macro) but I found an extension 
that inserts "fixed values" for date or time. I was inserting @now which 
includes both date and time, and in the long run is more useful for 
calculations. But I can get along with just inserting the current time 
for the purposes of this time sheet spreadsheet.

What browser, what version do you have now and what version did you use

What OS?
Does this happen on all pages you try to refresh on all sites?

I reread the original post and subsequent responses. To be sure, for any
Debian based distro there is only 1 package management *system* and that is
dpkg which uses ".deb" package files. There are however many different
Debian package management systems such as Apt, Aptitude, Synaptic, tasksel,
and dselect.

What I was taught was to use dpkg as much as possible to mitigate
communication and sync errors between it and other package mgmt tools. But
often times when I'm following a tutorial on how to do something or showing
a less experienced friend how to do things I will use different pkg mgmt
tools.

You can use all the other tools in addition to dpkg but you can't use them
w/o dpkg being called into use. And just because some writes a higher level
more user friendly tool doesn't mean they know how the lower level tool
works in totality and can write a program that won't corrupt or be out of
sync with the lower level tool.

On at least a few occasions, I've gotten different information in respect
to what's installed and what's not between different pkg mgmt systems. So
while I think it's reasonable to expect dpkg to know about any and all
software pkgs installed by other pkg mgmt tools, I also think it's just as
reasonable to expect that if you're using a few different pkg mgmt tools
that somewhere along the way things are going to get out of sync.

First, as others said, the refresh does not work on all web pages,
some page constructions make the refresh button not do what you think
it should. Another problem may be that your cache is corrupt. Try
Ctrl-Shift-R  to get a completely new page, bypassing the cache.

Lots of us want to expose our data via RESTful web APIs. We also want to 
consume data exposed via such APIs. REST + Json works well for this. 
However, we'd also like to mash up multiple data sources and build 
higher level tools. For example, it would be nice to create Business 
Intelligence (BI) tools that can point to any API and start charting the 
data, or create JavaScript control libraries that can be bound directly 
to data sources.

Unfortunately, that isn't possible with just REST + Json.

The problem is that each service is custom. No two services follow 
exactly the same rules. Sure, everything exposes sets of resources. But 
how do you get from a resource to its related resources? How do you ask 
the server to tell you about related resources? What, exactly should the 
server do when it gets a PATCH verb? Each server interprets these 
differently, which prevents making general tools.

I'm going to talk about the OData protocol. This is an open standard 
that defines uniform semantics and modeling for RESTful web services. 
I'll show how this allows general tools to be built, and data from 
multiple sources to be combined together in interesting ways - without 
requiring custom code for each server. I'll also show how this enables 
people working in different languages. A single library can be written 
for each language which can then support all OData-compliant RESTful web 
services.

Most of the examples will be with open source frameworks and tools, but 
I'll also show ways that you can use OData to break out data that is 
trapped in closed-source systems and expose it to the open source ecosystem.

Ctrl-Shift-R  Worked!!! Hurray!! Thank you!

I now have a sticky note to myself on the computer to remind me to use
Ctrl-Shift-R to refresh a page.

(Why does this have to be so complicated?)

Thank you!

You might try View / Toolbars / Customize / Restore Default Set

and then drag the buttons/icons/whatever to your liking.  E.g., I
liked it better when home and refresh and stop were all over to the
left, so that's where I put them.

Message-ID: <20120228220544.6d4c5a16@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I keep the major distros on my computer because I have pretty good
bandwidth at home and plenty of storage space. Mostly I do so for use
at the Clinic, but I am always happy to provide them to people who have
slow connections.

I just went through my Distros folder and updated to the latest
versions. I have the ISOs in 32- and 64-bit (when available), and I
keep the various spins for those distros that come in different
flavors. Here is what I maintain:

ArchLinux
Damn Small Linux
Fedora (last two releases)
Knoppix
Mint
OpenSuse
Porteus (was Slax)
Puppy
Slackware
Ubuntu (10.04 through 11.10)
Rescue CDs (half a dozen different ones)

I will have my computer with me at the meeting this Thursday. Bring a
blank CD/DVD or a flash drive and take home whatever you want. They're
free!

I'm also wondering if there is a way at the Linux Clinic to provide a PXE
network boot and install? My Debian install on my Toshiba Netbook became
corrupted and non-functional. it doesn't support booting from the usb
drive...

Preboot Execution Environment. 

There's lots of documentation on the 'net on how to set this up. Basically, you'll need a a dhcp server, and a tftp server that can serve the install files to the network clients.

PXE booting is the easy part.? Providing the
server...I'll do that too.

Hello all,

I have heard yet another person say that http://www.freepbx.org/ does 
not suck and is in fact is quite good.

Is anyone using FreePBX and if so, would you like to share your findings 
at a General or AT meeting?

Thanks,

Michael

I cannot say that I would make a great speaker, but I have quite a bit 
of experience with
several versions of FreePBX with my oldest version over 5 years old and 
running great.

I am about to rebuild our outdated version with the latest build as well 
so it will
be fresh in my mind

I volunteer.

It does sound like fun. I've often thought about combining a short
educational session with each Clinic. This might be an opportunity to
try out the idea.

I think we have at least one router and one switch in the PLUG box at
Free Geek. Plus we have cables in abundance and probably miscellaneous 
other equipment. However, bear in mind that we will need our own
network, as we don't have permission to install things on Free Geek's
network. I'm sure everyone has already thought of that; I just wanted
to mention it to be sure that everyone knows.

Great = know more than we do and communicate it to the best of your 
abilities.

Excellent!

Will April work? General or AT? I have a group working on a talk that 
can go either way, leaving the other slot open.

Hopefully we can talk tomorrow night.

Michael

P.S. With profound hesitation for fear of breaking the most sacred of 
PLUG traditions... I updated the pdxlinux.org main page to reflect the 
upcoming events. It needs much work but I removed the worst of the dated 
information. Daniel, let's talk github etc.

Lots of us want to expose our data via RESTful web APIs. We also want to 
consume data exposed via such APIs. REST + Json works well for this. 
However, we'd also like to mash up multiple data sources and build 
higher level tools. For example, it would be nice to create Business 
Intelligence (BI) tools that can point to any API and start charting the 
data, or create JavaScript control libraries that can be bound directly 
to data sources.

Unfortunately, that isn't possible with just REST + Json.

The problem is that each service is custom. No two services follow 
exactly the same rules. Sure, everything exposes sets of resources. But 
how do you get from a resource to its related resources? How do you ask 
the server to tell you about related resources? What, exactly should the 
server do when it gets a PATCH verb? Each server interprets these 
differently, which prevents making general tools.

I'm going to talk about the OData protocol. This is an open standard 
that defines uniform semantics and modeling for RESTful web services. 
I'll show how this allows general tools to be built, and data from 
multiple sources to be combined together in interesting ways - without 
requiring custom code for each server. I'll also show how this enables 
people working in different languages. A single library can be written 
for each language which can then support all OData-compliant RESTful web 
services.

Most of the examples will be with open source frameworks and tools, but 
I'll also show ways that you can use OData to break out data that is 
trapped in closed-source systems and expose it to the open source ecosystem.

     *******************************************************************

         Agenda:

             7:00 - 7:30  Business

I planned on bringing an an port switch.  To do this we need to control
the DHCP environment.  All we'll need is cat 5 cables.
