Subject: [PLUG] Looking for Linux laptop, SATA, >= 2007
Message-ID: <20110202000626.GA32444@gate.kl-ic.com>

A former plugger is now in foreign lands, and wants a replacement
for his venerable Thinkpad T30.  He likes the Lenovo T60, but most
of those on eBay are going for more than he can afford.  Being
stateside, I can buy and fix and test before sending to him.  Once
it is shipped, it will be difficult to maintain, so we want something
robust.  SATA and WIFI are required, something 2007 or newer needed
so it has some life left.  He will be running Ubuntu, probably 10.04 .

Any T60s available under $180 among you?  More likely, do any of
you have another quality brand of laptop which you can recommend
for reliability and for Linux drivers? 

We are thinking HP if we can't afford a Thinkpad, but I have
insufficient experience with their reliability.  I've seen far
too many failures with Dell to take a risk with those.  Heck,
many models of Thinkpads have flaws (some T30s, some T61s), but
at least I know which ones to avoid, the Linux Thinkpad community
shares lots of stories.

Please don't think of this as an opportunity to unload a junker.
This machine will be my friend's livelihood, and he will not earn
the funds for replacement for a long time.  We need data more than
we need a particular machine.

Haha.  

I did already give one a couple of years ago:
  http://projects.sentinelchicken.org/howtos/lug-ipv6

Looking back at the presentation, it's remarkable how close the
estimates were on exhaustion.  Of course the past prediction data is
all available in the IPv4 Address Report.

I'm not sure if I'd have time to put together another talk with a
different focus... But I would be interested in attending and lending
discussion points though.

But wait, there's more!

There will be a door prize!

Two DDR2-667 512MB sticks, SiS brand. They came from a recent laptop
and were working fine when removed. If you're the lucky one now you can
upgrade that laptop!

Subject: [PLUG] fun with iptables
Message-ID: <4D48C44B.40000@gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

Sorry about the newbie questions... This one is giving me fits. I have 
the openvpn client rules set up (as per my question yesterday - thank 
you again EJ), and the correct ip is being assigned to my test account.

Now, I am trying to restrict that test account to only be able to access 
one specific server. All other traffic of any form should be allowed. As 
it is, my test account is not able to access anything except the openvpn 
server itself. If I turn iptables off, everything is talking to 
everything again.

Here is the output of the iptables file (I have also added comments to 
the five custom entries I made in iptables. Also, IPs and names have 
been changed, not that it really matters):

    [dan at server1 sysconfig]# cat iptables
# Firewall configuration written by system-config-securitylevel
# Manual customization of this file is not recommended.
*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:RH-Firewall-1-INPUT - [0:0]
-A FORWARD -i tun0 -s 192.168.0.1/30 -d 172.16.0.50 -j ACCEPT #This 
client should be able to access this one server.
-A FORWARD -i tun0 -s 192.168.0.1/30 -j DROP #The same client should not 
be able to access anything else.
-A FORWARD -i tun0 -j ACCEPT #Everyone else should be able to access 
everything else.
-A INPUT -j ACCEPT #All traffic directed directly to this machine should 
be allowed.
-A INPUT -j ACCEPT #All traffic originating from this machine should be 
allowed.
-A OUTPUT -j RH-Firewall-1-INPUT
-A FORWARD -j RH-Firewall-1-INPUT
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type any -j ACCEPT

-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

[dan at server1 sysconfig]#

The output from iptables-L looks good (to me anyway):

[dan at server1 sysconfig]# iptables -L

ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:ipp
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere            state 
RELATED,ESTABLISHED
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            state NEW 
tcp dpt:ssh
REJECT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere            reject-with 
icmp-host-prohibited
[dan at server1 sysconfig]#

It was my understanding that iptables processed rules from the top down, 
and that once a rule condition was met, it skipped any further rules. 
Maybe I'm wrong. Does anyone see a problem with the above? Thanks in 
advance!

I'm trying to talk one of my co-workers to brush up his presentation and give it

Hello,
    I've made a survey for Linux User Group members across North America. I
would like to get the pulse of different groups and see what's working so
that all LUG's can improve the experience. This data will be published on
http://clug.ca (the Calgary Linux User Group website) on August, 2011. The
survey is only 12 questions, and shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to
complete.

Subject: [PLUG] when was the first release of Grass 64 bit? (fwd)
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1102020957560.4447@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This is a interesting thread from the GRASS (Geographic Resource Analysis
Support System) GIS mail list. Apparently, Wikipedia notes that a
Windows-based GIS called Manifold was the first 64-bit GIS when released in
May 2006. The author of that article is apparently un-aware that GRASS
started life as the Ft. Hood Environmental Information System in 1988 and
was developed by the Army Corps of Engineers' Construction Engineering
Research Lab (CERL) at the Univ. of Illinois in Chambana for use on UNIX
systems.

   For more than a decade, since CERL dropped development, it has continued
to grow primarily through the efforts of European developers. The main
platform since then has been linux and the *BSDs, but proprietary unices
were supported for a while.

   So, for anyone who cares, here are the pertinent selections from this
thread:

---------- Forwarded message ----------

> Does any know when GRASS 64-bit was first released?

http://grass.osgeo.org/announces/announce_grass500pre2.html
GRASS GIS 5.0.0pre2 released 13 September 2001
"Platforms supported by GRASS:
Linux, Sun Solaris, Sun Solaris/Intel, Silicon Graphics Irix, HP-UX,
DEC-Alpha, PowerPC, MacOS X, AIX, BSD, CRAY and other UNIX compliant
platforms (32/64bit), experimentally Windows NT/2000 running Cygnus"

... so that was way before 2006.

Subject: [PLUG] Trying to change gnome-terminal command behavior
Message-ID: <AANLkTimhvtr2jQv+ZumOhoGNS7-rU5GAwJp2-HJuH-En@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to open a new window on my desktop using the
"gnome-terminal" command line, but have noticed a peculiarity which I
would like to find a fix for.

When the command first comes up, it switches the active focus to that
new window on the desktop which is traditional behavior.  The mouse
and keyboard follow suite and are echoed in the new window.  A person
can jump out by mouse clicking outside the new window.

However if I am running on a different desktop and have a background
program which issues the "gnome-terminal" command in a different
desktop area, gnome-terminal brings up the active window in my desktop
area, not the one of the issuing program running the script file.

This is quite annoying, as it grabs the mouse and keyboard entries,
right in the middle of my work and leads to problems.

How can I force gnome-terminal to not jump over desktops but stay
rooted in the desktop of the shell script file that issued the
command?

The script files issues multiple gnome-terminal commands, since a work
file is being processed, so I don't need this constant popping up and
grabbing the focus behavior.  I want gnome-terminal to stay in the
original desktop where the script file resides and let me work in
peace.

Any ideas?

p.s. I am surprised that the command doesn't have an option to control
this behavior.

i too am a hater of focus thieves.  but then, i use a window manager
that doesn't require a mouse most of the time =) (network-manager is
the bane of my existence on a flaky wireless network i'm forced to
use--it pops up the password dialog repeatedly whenever flakiness
occurs.  grr!)

in the grand tradition of this list in failing to answer the original
query, i have to ask why the background job is using a graphical
terminal at all?  perhaps if you describe the workflow of the
background job we could offer alternative non-gui suggestions, which
would certainly be my preference for a job i am not currently
interacting with.

to address the actual question, as far as i know (and i am no expert,
even after using the x window system for 17 years), there is no way to
address workspaces via xwin geometry which would be the easiest
suggestion:  just tell use the -geometry flag and specify a geometry
on the appropriate workspace.  unfortunately workspaces are a window
manager trick, not an x window server level trick, so i guess that
isn't surprising really--the x server doesn't really know about the
workspace phenomenon (or if it does, doesn't at a geometry level, just
at a "cache the display from these various "viewports"" level).  if
you were having it come up on the wrong *display* (monitor), that's
the right answer.

depending on your window manager (ok, every one i've ever used, which
is probably a dozen, but that leaves dozens i have no experience
with), most support you tying a window to a workspace in the window
manager--but you'll probably have to give it a title and key on that
title, otherwise all gnome-terminals will do what you want the rogue
one to do.  i don't even have gnome-terminal installed to test this
theory, but i would be surprised if it didn't have some way to set the
title on invocation.  that way might not be via command flags, but
perhaps via .Xdefaults/xrdb(1).

so if all that doesn't give you enough rope to figure it out on your
own, we likely need more info to provide you an actual answer.  such
as:  what window manager do you use ('gnome' is probably not enough.
'gnome with metacity' or similar is probably better).

this question probably has a simple answer in the end, but not knowing
it or being able to determine it without the more info requested, i
just said everything relevant to the situation that came to mind.
hope it helped.

Similarly to Chris, I"m having a hard time brushing the fact that your
script is running gnome-terminal under the rug... but ok. I'll try to
ignore that :)

This sort of behavior is controlled by your window manager, by
default, so finding an option may be difficult. Depending on your WM,
you might be able to tell it to always load certain windows in a
certain place, but that's likely to be fickle, since you may not
always start the script from the same desktop).  You might be able to
force the terminals to run minimized with the WM, but you will have to
find a way to uniquely identify those terminals (possible through a
certain title bar format.)

There are some other options though, that hinge on gnome-terminal's
comand line flags.  If you can update your script to invoke
gnome-terminal with certain flags, you can probably make it work:

--class=CLASS              Program class as used by the window manager
--name=NAME               Program name as used by the window manager
-t, --title=TITLE               Set the terminal title
    All three of these are useful for giving all the terminals that
the script launches a unique name.

--display=DISPLAY               X display to use
--screen=SCREEN                 X screen to use
    Force terminals to always show up on a specific X screen/display
(exactly what these mean for you is hard to say -- you'll have to
experiment).  Figuring out which is the right one, for a given
invocation of the script is tricky, but possible. (see below).

--geometry=GEOMETRY             Set the window size; for example:
80x24, or 80x24+200+200 (ROWSxCOLS+X+Y)
   This is just good to know of, but probably won't help much.

--maximize
   Not at all useful, really, but it indicates that there *might* be
an undocumented --minimize flag, which *could* help.

Figuring out where the script is running -- this also depends heavily
on your window manager, and honestly I don't know enough about the
tools to say for sure how to do it.  I have some ideas...

You almost certainly need the window ID for the window you're
launching the script from.  I use this little hack:

winIDHex=`xprop -root _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW | awk '{print $5}'`

That assumes that the window is active -- so you *must* do this very
early in the script (the first thing, ideally).  If you move focus out
side of the window before getting the window id, you will probably get
the wrong result.

Once you have the window id, you can use tools like xwininfo to get
the geometry of that window, WM hints, etc... I don't know if that is
enough -- probably not, so you may need to find a WM-specific tool
that can take a window id and return a screen.  Then you can use that
with the --screen option to gnome-terminal later in the script.

Good luck!

Assuming you're using metacity since this is in reference to gnome-terminal...

While not a perfect solution, you can prevent any window opened from a
terminal from receiving focus by default.  You can get this behavior
by changing a registry key in the GConf configuration
$> gconftool-2 --set /apps/metacity/general/focus_new_windows --type
string strict

About the focus_new_windows property from the documentation:
"This option provides additional control over how newly created
windows get focus. It has two possible values; "smart" applies the
user's normal focus mode, and "strict" results in windows started from
a terminal not being given focus."

There is a second key, /apps/metacity/general/no_focus_windows, where
you can modify focus based on the name or class of a window:
"This option provides a way to specify new windows that shouldn't get
focus. Normally an application specifies whether or not it gets focus
by setting the _NET_WM_USER_TIME property, but legacy applications may
not set this, which can cause unwanted focus stealing. The contents of
this property is a space-separated list of expressions to match
against windows. If any of the expressions match a window then the
window will not get focus. The syntax of expressions is: (eq
[name|class] "<value>"): window name (title) or the class from
WM_CLASS matches <value> exactly. (glob [name|class] "<glob>"): window
name (title) or the class from WM_CLASS matches the shell-style glob
pattern <glob>. (and <expr> <expr>) (or <expr> <expr>) (not <expr):
Boolean combinations of expressions."

If you set the name or class of the terminal window with --class= or
--name=, you should be able to control its focus.

There's a tool called Devil's Pie
(https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Devilspie) that allows you to
control window behavior based on a configuration file.  Among other
things, you can make it so that when a window matching a certain
description is created that it automatically gets opened on a specific
desktop.  Definitely worth checking out.  Additional documentation on
it's config format:

Subject: [PLUG] Still having fun with IPTables
Message-ID: <4D49BBFD.7040805@gmail.com>

Hey all,

I tried to send this yesterday, but was having some issues with the 
wireless network. I didn't receive it from the list, so I'm resending. 
Any suggestions on what the problem may be would be _greatly_ 
appreciated. If others have already received this, please accept my most 
humble apologies.


I have the openvpn client rules set up (as per my question earlier this 
week - thank you again EJ), and the correct virtual ip is being assigned 
to my test account when i connect through openvpn.

Now, I am trying to restrict that test account to only be able to access 
one specific server. All other traffic of any form should be allowed. As 
it is, my test account is not able to access anything except the openvpn 
server itself. If I turn iptables off, everything is talking to 
everything again.

Here is the output of the iptables file (I have also added comments to 
the five custom entries I made in iptables. Also, IPs and names have 
been changed, not that it matters, no one could identify anything with a 
private IP.):

    [dan at server1 sysconfig]# cat iptables

The output from iptables-L looks good (to me anyway) too:

[dan at server1 sysconfig]# iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)

REJECT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere            reject-with

[dan at server1 sysconfig]#

It was my understanding that iptables read rules from the top down, and 
that once a rule condition was met, it skipped any further rules. Does 
anyone see a problem with the above? Thanks in advance!

I don't know why, but Gmail is flagging your messages as spam. Whatever
crazy thing you're doing, I suggest you knock it off :)

Hi Wes,


Thanks for the heads-up. I can assure you i am not doing anything 
"crazy"... Perhaps something in the email was causing gmail to flag it 
as spam (keywords or links). I have removed the configs and links from 
this email. Hopefullt that will enable it to get through.

I noticed that both of my emails did make it to the Archives page. If 
anyone is willing to help me with my original question, the original 
email may be in your spam folder, or perhaps you could utilize the 
February 2011 Archives on the pdxlinux website.

Once again, thank you for any assistance you may be willing to offer!


Best regards,
Daniel M. Head

this one came "From" a different address, so I'm afraid I'll have to suggest
again that you are doing something... not straightforward.

However, this one did come through correctly.

I wish I knew something about iptables which could help you.

If you're using Compiz, the Window Rules and Place Windows plugins let 
you manipulate a lot of these setting via a decent GUI (CompizConfig 
Settings Manager).

Someday, I need to do better tests of my own iptables setup.
Thinking about Dan's problem, I stumbled across this:

http://ozlabs.org/~jk/projects/nfsim/howto/

I don't know whether it is actually useful, but it appears to be
a way to test the iptables rules offline.  After the rules are
tested and installed, I would use something like nessus to see
if they are keeping the bad guys out.

I've been thinking about how secure my own firewall is.  I looked
at the stats for my firewall machine last night.  In the last 70
days, I saw a total of ~40GB of movement on eth0, the WAN port, and
only ~20GB of movement on eth2, the internal LAN port.  Since I do
nightly dirvish backups on all machines, including the firewall,
I would expect slightly more internal than external traffic.

This makes me wonder if the firewall is 0wned and being used to
spew spam, or whether it is merely fending off a lot of attacks.
I will turn on more logging and observation.

Unless you are doing backups *to* (or from) the firewall, the amount
of traffic it sees on the internal interface isn't going to reflect
traffic within your network.  Your backup traffic is going to hit a
switch and go directly to its internal destination.  You didn't
mention eth1.  I suspect it might make up the balance of your
traffic.

Message-ID: <AANLkTik-3AGXdDt2_cp8DQAf6g1vP1VnasDuAr7JHepw@mail.gmail.com>

Gmail just destroyed an email reply that took me 1/2 to make...

The answer to the focus problem was found by changing a parameter
under the compiz screen0 settings.  I used the gconf-editor command to
open up the editor and to go to the appropriate location.  Metacity is
not used on my Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid OS, but compiz.

I can live with this partial solution now, and might look at what it
takes to force a gnome-terminal into a certain desktop issue.

grrrrrrr:  I took the time to answer the questions and then gmail
smashes everything and gives the "we don't know what happened,
temporary system error, come back later" reply.

Sorry, no, but I wasn't clear about why I don't see this as any better
performing than port knocking.  However, on reflection, I would even
grant that claim: the use of a DNS label as the password is easier,
and requires less pre-configuration than port knocking.  It is also
much more likely to pass unmolested through the (frequently stupid)
outbound filtering on various vendor networks.

I would suggest, however, that it is actually less secure against
eavesdroppers, since you can observe a well known and structured
protocol, and even automatically scan for data that doesn't follow the
standard distribution of English text to find interesting labels to
consider.

As you note in your thesis, adding additional cryptographic systems,
or an OTP, to the protocol would secure things nicely ? but it would
require appropriate client software, at which point the advantage over
other secure protocols is more limited.

*shrug*  Overall I don't think my assessment compared to port knocking
has been changed, but the reasons have.  I appreciate your taking the
time to talk it over for that reason. :)

*nod*  I certainly don't deny it, and I don't think this is an excuse
to just throw up hands and give up.  I just think that it limits the
degree to which we should worry about DoS issues compared to other
attacks.

I don't have a lot of respect for that guy.  His argument consists of
some irrelevant accusations and reasons-to-possibly-hate-google, not
really germane to whose search engine is better.  He seems like kind of a
shill.

It sounds like maybe Microsoft is just mining associations it finds
flying by, but that is a little lame compared to people really working
at making the associations to begin with.  It is particularly ironic
in light of Microsoft's claims in its TV ads of how it provides more
relevant results than google.

Note: i've cross-posted this to plug-talk, maybe we should continue
the conversation there.

Subject: [PLUG] NX and shared clipboard
Message-ID: <4D4B49B1.4010609@gmail.com>

Greetings friends!


I've put the OpenVPN issue on the back burner, at least for today, so I 
could get some work actually completed. The latest project today was to 
uninstall FreeNX and to get NX Free Edition installed on a server. My 
manager also wanted to limit the copy-paste buffer to 200 characters, so 
that if someone were trying to steal code, it would be an extremely 
frustrating undertaking (but couldn't they write a script?).

Anyway, I found out how to completely disallow copy/paste between the 
client and the server (the admin-guide, section 10.9 says to edit the 
/usr/NX/etc/server.cfg file EnableClipboard to = "none".

That's great, but my manager wants to be able to copy and paste, just 
with a seriously restricted buffer.

Does anyone know of an option to do this? Maybe by limiting X11's 
clipboard buffer or something?

As always, any help is greatly appreciated!!!

before you spend a lot of time delving into this...is there really no
other way to ship the code out of a session?  they can't (possibly
download and) fire up ftp, scp, a web browser, or anything else that
takes an entire file as input, whether or not you limit cut and paste?

it just seems like you might be chasing a fox out of the henhouse but
leaving an army of cat burglars in there.

Hi Chris,


Thank you for your thoughts. These issues crossed my mind as well. The 
idea is that we will eventually have an OpenVPN tunnel with a firewall 
that only allows NX traffic to a single machine, for a limited number of 
remote users.

So in a way, yes, this all may be moot if I am not able to set up 
OpenVPN and IPTables the way we need... But I *think* it's doable, I 
just need to figure it out.

If the client computer isn't secured then all bets are off.  A
screenshot of an 800x600 resolution image can store a good 1.5 million
bytes of data, approximately 18,000 lines of 80-column text.  You can
get even more if you compress the data before encoding it.

Something like the following would do the trick...
$> cat file1.c file2.c /dev/zero | rawtoppm 800 600 > encoded.ppm
$> eog encoded.ppm

The PPM file format is ridiculously easy to generate so, even if
Netpbm packages are not installed...
echo "P6
800 600
255
DATA" > encoded.ppm

Why give yourself away that way?

Thanks for the thought everyone.

Even though someone might have a lockpick, and someone else might break 
the window, I still think it's a good idea to lock your front door.

The 2 somewhat obvious choices are Asus Eeee pc and Acer Aspire One. Just
curious what other Netbooks people are running Linux on and what their
experience has been. I'll probably run my Linux of choice on it Sidux.
Unless there's a really compelling Netbook distro that I just must run
because it's just so awesome.

For my purposes, battery life, light weight, overall speed, durability and
the ability to upgrade at least the memory are the most important features.

Thank you in advance for your insights, stories, and recommendations.

No.  There will be no performance hit, full stop, if you use cables
that meet the specification for gigabit Ethernet.  (Obviously, damaged
or substandard cables may not deliver. ;)

So, no, that should be just fine, as would either Cat6 STP or fibre.

If I was in the market for a netbook I'd look at the Motorola Atrix 4G.
You can get a laptop dock for it that basically turns it into a
netbook. When it's not a netbook its an Android 2.2 phone. Of course,
if you don't need a phone, then it becomes too expensive for a netbook.
At $500 for the phone + dock bundle it's even expensive for a phone +
netbook. But you'd have a netbook that can always connect and doesn't
need a friendly coffee shop.

Ah yes, I recall reading about this and then forgot about it. Thanks for
reminding me! This was just revealed at CES, correct? I recall thinking how
amazing I thought this product was and how happy I was to see MotoroIa
innovating again! I wonder if it's actually on the market yet...

I am using a Toshiba N305 and am quite happy with it.  Commonly get between
7-9 hours of battery life, easy memory and hard drive upgrades.  It has a
10" screen and a nice, almost full ( for a laptop) sized keyboard.

It had a couple of glitches with the backlight not being adjustable and it
hesitating due to a lack of interrupts.  Both of these problems have been
addressed with recent updates from Ubuntu.  Never tried Sidux so I cannot
speak about if these issues exist with it.  If you are interested, let me
know and I can try running a copy of Sidux on it, and see if everything
works right.

Not knowing what Sidux is I went a-googling.
Important News: sidux is dead, long live aptosid
http://sidux.com/index.php?module=News&func=display&sid=616

As I am sure you are all aware, there have been interesting times for sidux recently.   The bad news is that the sidux
project is dead.   The good news is that aptosid has been aptly born like a phoenix from the ashes and will provide a
smooth upgrade for sidux systems.   In many ways nothing has changed but our name.

I know most of the PLUGers & Free Geekers are big fans of Ubuntu. But I'm

Maybe Ubuntu Netbook is faster/better than Ubuntu "standard". I'll at least
give it a spin. I'm also curious
about Jolicloud, which is Ubuntu based, and Chrome OS. But not totally sold

There's some interesting distros I found here to try as well:

Subject: [PLUG] EISA partition on Toshiba laptop
Message-ID: <AANLkTinQHGML6itdkKQbstJ9x1g4rniQO+t_1OW++yAC@mail.gmail.com>

I was wondering if anyone better versed in the complexities of laptop
hardware -- which is probably almost everyone on this list -- could
provide some useful advice about how to set-up my Toshiba L505 laptop
for dual-booting.

fdisk -l shows this now:

Disk /dev/sda: 320.1 GB, 320072933376 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 38913 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x74b860c1

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1   *           1         192     1536000   27  Unknown
Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary.
/dev/sda2             192       19882   158165141    7  HPFS/NTFS
/dev/sda3           37729       38914     9512960   17  Hidden HPFS/NTFS
/dev/sda4           24981       37729   102398977    f  W95 Ext'd (LBA)
/dev/sda5           24981       37206    98190336   83  Linux
/dev/sda6           37206       37729     4207616   82  Linux swap / Solaris

Partition table entries are not in disk order

This laptop (and many other Toshiba models) come out of the box with
three primary partitions.  What is currently /dev/sda3 is a recovery
partition, useful for restoring the computer to its "out-of-the-box"
state or some variation thereof.  However, I made recovery discs, so I
already know that I don't need this partition.  What is currently
/dev/sda2 is where Window 7 resides.  When I installed Ubuntu, all I
did was shrink /dev/sda2 and created the extended partition
(/dev/sda4) on which Ubuntu resides.

The partition I'm not sure about is /dev/sda1, which as you can see is
apparently bootable.  I found this discussion:

http://forums.techguy.org/windows-vista/619983-solved-mystery-partition-toshiba-notebook.html

It seems to indicate that /dev/sda1 is an EISA partition, and I'm not
really clear on what that means or whether I actually need it.  My
problem is that I wanted to try installing Arch Linux and Arch uses
cfdisk for the install.  cfdisk doesn't like the fact that /dev/sda1
doesn't end on a cylinder boundary and it craps out with a fatal
error, saying something about me having illegal partitions (grrr).

After some investigating, I figured out that I can get rid of
/dev/sda3 and I decided what I want to do is reformat and reinstall
Windows 7 using the recovery discs I made, then install Arch (or maybe
Debian, if Squeeze really is released this weekend).  What I'm not
sure about is, do I need this mystery EISA partition?  I'm not sure
what will happen when I do the recovery.  The Toshiba manual says you
have the choice of restoring to out-of-the-box state or reinstalling
on a custom-sized C:\ partition.  It also says the recovery process
will completely wipe the hard drive.  It doesn't say anything about
whether it will recreate this small mystery partition.  In fact,
there's no indication anywhere in the manual that this partition even
exists -- it's like they don't want you to know about it.

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of thing?

Michael

If I wanted a Netbook I would get a Starling Netbook from System76.  It has 
Ubuntu 10.04 Netbook Edition (Lucid Lynx) 32 Bit Linux installed on it. I 
already have a laptop from System76. I got it last September and I have been 
upgrading it every 6 months when new release of Ubuntu comes out. I have it 
upgraded to 10.10 right now.

Not quite yet. The February 3 edition of the Wall Street Journal had an
article stating that AT&T (the only vendor) would take orders starting
February 13 and that the ship date would be March 6. However, that was
the WSJ, and there has been no word from Motorola confirming or
denying. Rumors have been flying ever since CES, and at one time both
Amazon and Costco had ads listing the phone for $150, but the pages
were quickly removed, although Amazon does currently list four pages
of accessories. There are also reports on the net that AT&T employees
are currently receiving training on it.

I plan to get one as soon as I can, but just the phone, not the dock,
although I'll also get a 32 GB microSD card. (Note to self: Figure out
if the microSD card will fit in my Thinkpad T61.) The phone is $200
(with new plan or upgrade contract), and the dock is $500, although you
can get them both in a bundle for $500. You can get a real netbook with
more power for ~$350, which is why I said that it's a bit overpriced if
you want it as a netbook. The only justification for the price is the
convenience of using it as either a phone or a netbook. Or the fact
that you'll be the coolest kid on the block.

A general rule of thumb for computers.  Always have a second copy.
Hard drives are cheap.  Most laptops have a way to attach a second
drive (thinkpads use "ultrabay", swappable between CD and floppy
and battery and hard drive tray.  With linux, you can use dd (or
ddrescue) to make a bit level copy to a second drive. 

Windoze may complain if you boot from that second drive (windoze
tracks hardware) but even if it won't boot,  you still have a
copy of the original bits you can restore to the original disk.

If you use a model-identical hard drive under Linux,  then the
copy drive functions almost identically to the original.  This
is good for on-the-road backups.  Not sure about grub2 - that
may "helpfully" insist on the same drive ID.

Hard drives are getting cheaper, so a drive on the shelf is not
a good investment, dollars per gigabyte.  But it is an excellent
investment in a quick-swap spare.  An identical drive may not be
available next year.

So, buy a second drive, copy the bits onto it, see how it behaves
used as a replacement (probably usably but poorly under windoze). 
Then try removing /dev/sda3 and see what happens; now you can put
it back if it doesn't work.

Keith

PS:  Lately, in my more paranoid moments, I wonder if these
unexplained partitions are where the Chinese People's Liberation
Army hides their cyber-war logic bombs.  Not much hiding, but
Americans don't do much looking.  It wouldn't be difficult to
write an app that checksums these partitions, looking for changes
over time or between machines.  That would be interesting.

Message-ID: <1296944875.4766.10.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I have an old PII 300 system in a separate building the purpose of which
is to act as a wireless router and camera platform.  Why a PII-300?
Don't care if it gets stolden.  I use SCSI hard drives, a Cheetah 18 gig
and two Compaq 4 gig drives connected to an Adaptec 2940U2W.  Trouble
is, the hard drives randomly drop.  Anyone experience this problem that
knows of a solution?

Another question, a full blown computer seems like overkill.  I want a 
non intrusive indoor AP, possibly wireless cameras, and phone
capability.  It should be possible to call through the network anyone
in the other two buildings and via a special code perhaps access an
outside line.  The output of the cameras should be visible from anywhere
on the network.  So, I'm looking at 8 locations for telephone.
Alternatively, being able to ring a bell remotely would be helpful.

Another problem I'm having, I have a USB connected APC ups that I'm
trying to connect via the latest version of NUT.  I get kernel won't
release or something similar, permission denied errors.  Obviously,
running a battery backup when the computer has local hard drives
is important.

For the phone thing, you can use voip devices - like Linksys spa2102.  Those are
are out there on the cheap.

For the camera and wireless, something like http://www.pcengines.ch/
alic boards with a
wireless card and usb camera attached would work.

Then again if you are really on the cheap, and time is not really an
issue, getting replacement drives
might be a better way to go.  Checking the  drives, get the sg3-utils
package and use sg_logs -a /dev/<device>
to get a list of errors the drive is seeing.

The 1000baseT spec only calls for Cat5, so 5e is more than fine.

If you're using 1000baseTX on the other hand Cat6 is specified,
although likely would work fine for short runs, FSVO "short".

It would seem 1000baseTX lost the gigabit ethernet war (similar to
Betamax vs. VHS) so odds are you're using 1000baseT.

Silly question, did you remember the '-o loop'  in the mount command?
I have run across problems mounting images that were pulled from cd,
research suggests it may be a problem with DAO vs TAO burning. A utility
called iat does image conversion to iso, this has cured my issues in the
past.

What kind of disk image is it?  You mentioned /mnt/dvd ... is it a DVD
image/iso?  If it is a hard drive image, then most likely the easiest
way would be to mount the partition(s) within the disk.

Once you figure out what byte offset your partitions start at, you can
mount them by doing (as root):

# losetup -o ${OFFSET} /dev/loop0 /path/to/disk.img
# mount /dev/loop0 /partition/mount/point

To figure out the offset, there are several ways.  You can use 
'fdisk -l ...', but I find it cumbersome.  If you install the
sleuthkit, it will provide a nice utility called 'mmls' which lists
partition tables.  The offset output is always in 512 byte blocks.
Often the first partition on PCs is at block offset 63, so you might
find yourself running:

# losetup -o $((63*512)) /dev/loop0 /path/to/disk.img



An alternative approach to this is to instead load the kernel's
"loop" module with a non-zero max_part parameter.  Then you can create
the loopback device without any offset parameter:

# losetup /dev/loop0 /path/to/disk.img

And from there, the kernel should automatically detect the partitions
and create extra devices named: /dev/loop0pN  where 'N' is the
partition number (much like /dev/sda provides partitions /dev/sdaN).
Then you can just mount the /dev/loop0pN devices as you see fit.

If it is an image of an entire drive, you can also just use parted to view
the size and offset of the partitions within.

parted BackupImg.dd

It will complain about it being read only, of course, but it will still show
the required information.  You can then either mount as Tim mentioned or use
dd with the offset and count to extract the partitions to separate files.
Then, they can be directly mounted using the loop option, if that would be
better for your purpose.  I did some of this in a Digital Forensics class
last quarter and probably still have the lab/notes from it if you would like
a more explicit walk through.

   Google found no tool named iat that would be appropriate for this task. I
did find cdd2iso, but it ain't workin'. It wants ffmpeg and links, both of
which are installed and it cannot find.

   Sigh.

Tim,

   I've no idea. It probably comes from some version of ESRI's ARC/Info (or
ARC/GIS, whatever they're calling in nowadays.) The beginning of the file
has EHFA_HEADER_TAG.

Can you give us a little more background?  Namely:

- Where did you get the image?

- What programs normally use it?

- How do programs normally use it?  Are you expected to burn it it to
a DVD first and then have some program read it directly?

Rich,
    Did some tinkering after Tim's suggestions, hopefully this can help.

$ sudo losetup /dev/loop0 /path/to/.img
$ sudo mount /dev/loop0 /mount/dir


This was all that was required to mount an image to browse. mmls gave me no
information on the image, nor did sfdisk. They both complained about being
unable to read the image file or not recognizing the file system.
Hope this helps.
on a side note many image files actually show up as an hfs file system (-t
hfs).

It is the standard Debian/*Ubuntu repos. it simply converts image files to
iso.
>From $man iat

DESCRIPTION

 iat  (Iso9660 Analyzer Tool) is a tool for detecting the structure of many
types of CD-ROM image file formats, such as BIN, MDF, PDI, CDI, NRG, and
B5I, and  converting them into ISO-9660.

Good advice, but I'm broke.  Anyway, the problem isn't /dev/sda3, the
problem is /dev/sda1.  As Patrick pointed out, it's small potatoes at
less than 1.5GB (of a 320GB hard drive).  The problem isn't the size,
the problem is certain Linux utilities (namely, cfdisk) don't like it
and fail simply because it exists.  That's why I was trying to figure
out if it is actually necessary.  That's hard to do when I don't even
understand what it is or why Toshiba (and others) set up some of their
laptops this way.  Must it be present for the laptop to boot?  I don't
know.  Will it be untouched, deleted, or recreated if I use Toshiba's
recovery system do a custom reinstall of Windows 7 to a smaller "C:\"
(aka /dev/sda2) partition?  I don't know, but I guess I'll find out.

Some searching seems to indicate that is this a fairly common
question.  Answers, however, are harder to come by, and as always you
have to stumble through a lot of wild speculation and misinformation
to find them.  As best as I've been able to determine, this "EISA
partition" contains some kind of utilities that perhaps interact with
the BIOS and/or fill some kind of hardware diagnostic function.  fdisk
can't even identify a file system on this thing.  It doesn't seem to
be a Windows thing, it seems to be a hardware thing.  It might be
related to the recovery software various manufacturers ship with their
laptops, since many manufacturers are no longer providing recovery
discs, or it might not.  On this laptop, Toshiba's actual recovery
partition is /dev/sda3, which is about 10GB, and which can be deleted
if you make your own set of recovery DVDs (which I've done).  But
maybe the recovery process actually needs /dev/sda1 to be present?
Again, I don't know.

In any case, GParted doesn't seem to mind /dev/sda1, so if necessary I
can use the GParted Live CD to create my partitions in advance of
installing any Linux distro, and not worry about whatever touchy
partitioning tools any particular distro uses in its installation
routine.

I don't think that is a disk image. Is it a real image/data
combination in some proprietary GIS  format?

From
home.gdal.org/projects/imagine/iau_docu1.pdf
We find that "The Ehfa_HeaderTag is used as a unique signature at the

   I would expect to find a .e00 (ARC Export format) file hidden in there. It
is used in GIS applications for spatial analyses and modeling. Why it was
created as an .img file I've no idea. Probably because whoever did so wasn't
thinking.

Bill,

   Well, I am suitably embarrassed. I should have searched with Google for
that header string before doing anything else.

   Yes, it does. I use gdal for all raster imports to GRASS.

Subject: [PLUG] Slackware upgrade...
Message-ID: <1297028267.5290.4.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

First problem, I don't have the ISOs for slackware 10.2 and 11.0.

I've already upgrade slackware 10.1 udev to slackware 11.0 udev using
slackware 10.2's udev as an intermediate upgrade.  The kernel is vanilla
2.6.18.8.  Question is, what else needs upgrading?  I assume glibc needs
to be upgraded, but what packages have to be upgraded with glibc?

I'm having trouble with nut-2.6.0.  Trouble seems to be traceable to
udev permissions.  If I do upsdrvctl -u root start, that sort of works.
Of course, the cgi scripts don't work when you have to be root and the
rc scripts don't either.  It should be simple to fix this issue, but for
the life of me I can't figure it out.  There is supposed to
be /dev/bus/usb/XXX/YYY, but that doesn't seem to exist on my system.
I seem to have a line in fstab to mount usbfs, so that isn't it.
Apparently, there is a change being made that affects how udev and
hotplugging function.

I submit that cfdisk is complaining about the partition limits,
not the type ID of sda1.  Note that the End & Start blocks of
sda1 and sda2 are the same.  The same holds true for sda4/sda3,
sda5/sda6, and sda6/sda3. This is bad.  Though you're not likely
to ever reach the last block of a partition, it is possible.  In
which case, the starting block of the next partition would be
overwritten, which would hose the whatever filesystem is resident
in that partition.  This could make for a very bad day indeed.

(FWIW:  A list of partition types I found on the web lists ID 27
as "'PQservice' -- Acer hidden rescue partition.  Must be FAT32.
Press Alt-F10 during boot to start this.  Also other
manufacturers use this type for their rescue partition."  See
<http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/partitions/partition_types-1.html>.)

Well, that's disturbing.  I wonder why all those other partitions (after 
sda2) are so configured.

I don't remember the exact error message from cfdisk, but it was 
something along the lines of the partition not ending on a sector 
boundary or a cylinder boundary.  Nothing about type ID.

Thanks for finding that.  I think the manual is rather confusingly 
written because it claims that the recovery process will (or can, 
depending upon which option you choose) destroy all other partitions, 
but I suspect that it really won't.  I bet it leaves /dev/sda1 in tact.

Subject: [PLUG] stress testing hard drive and laptop before shipping
Message-ID: <20110207100811.GD17426@gate.kl-ic.com>

About a week after it arrives, I will be shipping ebay-purchased
laptop to a friend out of the country.  Once shipped, it will be
difficult to maintain.  I've got the hard drive (new WD5000BEVT,
good reviews on newegg and amazon) , battery, and a few other
removables that will go on it, and I am testing them now, in a
different laptop.

I installed Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat (10.04LTS Lucid had
some issues, sigh).  I added some plausible packages:  bonnie,
ctcs, phoronix, stress, stressapptest, and computertemp to make
sure the laptop doesn't cook too much.

Right now, I am running "bonnie" on the hard drive, for a day
or two.   When the target laptop arrives, I will load the 
removables on it and use one or two of the test packages.  I
have not used them before.  Free Geek uses "stress" for a few
minutes on their laptop.  Rather than a quick but possibly
damaging test, I would rather run something moderately
stressful for days.

Any suggestions?

Keith

Subject: [PLUG] SCO Rescue diskettes/CDs, fixing vxfs file systems
Message-ID: <003801cbc6f2$e69179f0$b3b46dd0$@martinconsulting.com>

OK, so there are a lot of solutions for SCO in general, but those won't help
my situation.  I'm looking for anyone that has some old SCO rescue diskettes
or CDs they can lend me.

Here are the details...

I have a new client with an old SCO system (Open Server 6 according to the
splash screen) that is in trouble -- root file system full, some file
systems corrupted.  All should be easy to fix once I log on as root, but the
system has a preinstalled menu that pops up for root logins (including
single user mode and file system recovery logins).  The menu includes an
item to go to the shell prompt, but it doesn't work, presumably because of
the various system problems.  The other menu items are similarly useless.
^C, ^Z, and ^\ won't get me out.  I can't log into other accounts due to the
system problems, so su is out.  Possible solutions I can see are:

1) Think of some clever way to escape or avoid the menu

2) Bring up a rescue system to resolve the various file system errors (and
maybe kill the stupid menu).  The root file system is vxfs.  Research
indicates that Knoppix and most Linux systems don't understand vxfs, though
I didn't have the media with me when I was there to try it.

So, my questions are:
1) Does anyone have any clever ideas about escaping the menu?
2) Does anybody have a bootable media that will allow me to reliably work on
a vxfs file system?  The hardware is a Xeon, and supports CD, floppies, and
perhaps USB for booting.  The disks are SCSI.

   I don't use Google Earth much, but I can find my way through menus and I
even watched Google's tutorials without finding how to change the geographic
location of a placemark.

   A series of UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates was provided;
they're in Nevada Zone 11S and I have the eastings and northings for each
point. My Google search for instructions on how to enter these values
(rather than an address or place name) revealed that from version 5.2 on
they can be directly entered. So, I upgraded my 5.1 version to 6.0.2. All
well and good, so far.

   Using the "Add Placemark" toolbar feature (left most icon of a pushpin
with a + above it), I specified the zone, easting, and northing. Gave it a
name and clicked "OK." However, GE doesn't like the position and insists on
changing it.

   What I entered was (easting) 557018.00 m E, (northing) 4411377.00 m N. The
values displayed on the map are 557356.98 m E and 4411268.25 m N. I cannot
drag that icon to a new position and no matter how many times I re-enter the
desired coordinates for it it refuses to go there and immediately changes
the values to what it wants. The imagery data is 2006 and should be about 15
m resolution. While the position might not be precise (although it should be
since it's reported to 1 cm on the status line) it should not be so far off.

   Any suggestions from those more conversant with GE than I will be
appreciated.

The coordinates in the placemark represent the currently focused
position.  Not even sure why the fields are editable as it doesn't
refocus the window.  The actual coordinates the placemark uses for
focusing the view is whatever is in the "View" tab.  Unfortunately
this doesn't understand UTM coordinates, even if you change it in your
settings.

You can get what you're looking for by entering the following into the
"Fly To" field in the main part of the interface and the creating a
new placemark from that:
11S 557018 4411377

Daniel,

   Ah so. I was going by the forum threads. Either I mis-read them or the
answers weren't correct.

   That was the only syntax I didn't try.

I know nothing of SCO and have no media to help, but there may be a
Linux tool that will help:

Interestingly, it appears that John the Ripper can sleuth out passwords
on a vxfs system.

Subject: [PLUG] IEEE Cyber Espionage meeting
Message-ID: <20110207220658.GC25270@gate.kl-ic.com>

An important meeting coming up.  If you can afford to attend
next Thursday, please do.  While the speaker may not cover
the most important material, this is an opportunity to 
gather with managers thinking about security, and that
aspect could have enormous impact on our careers and the
survival of our community.

I just finished reading Richard Clarke's "Cyber War".  The
U.S. is very vulnerable and close to defenseless against
automated attack of interconnected SCADA systems running
the electric grid, oil pipelines, and the net itself.  
While Gary's meeting is focused on corporate espionage, 
the same spying techniques can also be used for sabotage.  

ObLinux - while the book is mostly focused on the political
stuff, Clarke does mention that China, by agreement, has
the Windows source code.  The US government, financial,
and industrial organizations do not.  So while the NSA is
busily analyzing Linux for security problems, contributing
to the patch stream, they aren't doing that for Windows.

ObPLUG - a lot of us are unemployed.  When companies wake
up (hopefully /before/ they are wiped out by logic bombs)
we will be overpaid, overworked, and overstressed.  So 
spend your downtime learning about security and getting
in good physical shape.  Your community will need you!

I don't mention this to be a scaremonger, especially not
if it leads to conflict with China or other countries.
We can be friends and partners.  But the current 
situation - no defense, expensive development of cyber
attack tools by the military - is an invitation to war.
The hot kind, with megadeaths.  Perhaps initiated by one
crazy person, like world war 1.  Proper cyber defense
is a way to protect the world without harming anyone.
Seat belts and defensive driving, not shooting at the
other cars.

Anyone know of a torrent download source for Slackware 10.2 and
Slackware 11 that I don't have to sign up for?  Strangely enough,
I've run into sites that are evidently porn sites trying to
grab a copy of Slackware 10.2 and Slackware 11.  So far, I have
only managed to pick up disk 1 for Slackware 10.2.

I checked isohunt.com out and there are 2 problems.

Problem 1, for the DVD torrents for Slackware 10.2 and Slackware 11.0
there appear to be 0 peers.

Problem 2, I don't appreciate the picture of a woman in lingerie with
the caption, "Want to make friends?"

Question, are udev and hotplugging ironed out by Slackware 13?

Anyone have these archived that I can purchase a copy from?

Subject: [PLUG] update on making a special Gnome-Terminal window
Message-ID: <AANLkTinE3-yK0NUj4+Sm1d3MrVWae-xGTj+_5DKg-LUh@mail.gmail.com>

To all:

Here's an update to the question I asked about setting a window in a
desktop with certain characteristics.

Procedure to set up a particular window on a specific desktop in the
background with no focus

Valid in the Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Edition running the compiz window manager.

1. Install CompizConfig-Settings-Manager using the Synaptic Package Manager

2. Under the System Preferences tab open up the Manager

3. Click the Window Management icon in the left column

4. Enable "Place Windows" and "Window Rules" icons so they are checked

5. Double click "Place Windows" icon to bring up that window

6. Tab to "Fixed Window Placement"

7. Underneath the bottom tab, Windows with fixed viewport enter in the
window identifier (usually the title), and then set the viewport X and
Y positions. It appears that 1 is desktop 1 for X. (not sure about Y
viewport position)

8. Hit the Back button in the lower left hand corner

9. Double click "Window Rules" icon to open that window

10. Under the tab "Below" enter in the window identifier (usually title)

11. Under the tab "No focus" enter in the same identifier.

I used the wild card character * on my Window title to match.

12. Hit the Back button to return to the CompizConfig Settings main screen.

DOUBLE CHECK: Make sure that the Enable Window Rules and Place Windows
are enabled

In the script file you can use the CLI command:

"gnome-terminal --window-with-profile=MyProfile

to initiate the popup window in the correct desktop.

I picked no-focus and background for my window, since I wanted to keep
working in any of the 4 desktops that I have.

It's now working great.

It might be nice to figure out how to set up metacity to do this?

I would suggest your choice of Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network

are extremely cpu bound so will test if your fans a spinning and blowing

UTM is a geographic coordinate system.  Nevada Zone 11S sounds like a state

I'm on a Slackware 10.1 system where udev has been upgraded to the

compiled 2.6.18.8 kernel.  This idVendor and idProduct info appears
under /sys, so I don't get why udev isn't seeing it.  There was an
experimental option involving the netlink device, I'm wondering if
I have to say yes to that?  Should I try an even newer kernel?  If
I do, what else do I have to upgrade?

I have some friends I am trying to help who live out in Gales Creek,

access. After viewing the horror stories reported by Blue Sky users, we 
are thinking mobile broadband. It is my understanding that presently, in 
their outlying area, it will be 3G rather than 4G.

Of course when you mention Linux to sales people, they wet themselves. 
One fellow corrected me that their USB "Card" did not contain a radio 
!@#$.  Does anyone have experience with Ubuntu (or other distribution) 
and Verizon wireless broadband devices? How fast and did you consider it 
usable? It HAS to better than dial-up????

I use a Verizon usb dongle (USB727) on my laptop (Ubuntu 10.04) when 
traveling. Not sure if that's 3G or not. I think it's pretty good. I've 
only had connection issues once in a high rise in Chicago. It's fast 
enough for web surfing, email, and iso downloads. I haven't tried to 
streaming movies on it, but based on the iso downloads (dvd in about an 
hour to hour and a half) I don't think speed is that bad.

I use wicd as my network manager, so I use wvdial on the command line 
for the modem. The defualt NM-Applet will work with the modem directly 
form the desktop though. The only setup issue I had was initializing the 
modem in windows first using the VZ manager program, but after the 
initial setup I've never had to go back into it.

I use my Droid phone for this.  Enable wired tethering on the phone.
Plug the USB cable into the laptop or desktop. Network-manager
recognizes the device and sets up a network connection. I only use
this occasionally for laptop access away from home or when my DSL
connection disappears at home, not for permanent access.  Speeds are
quite acceptable and way better than dialup when you have a good
signal.

I'd second the good experiences with Verizon dongles; I've used a USB760
quite a bit with the same caveat of having to activate it in Windows the
first time.

I tested a 3G USB key from AT&T and found that it's linux support was quite
lacking, I wish I remembered the modle number so you could avoid it, but I
sadly do not.  Obviously YMMV depending on what's out there now.

interesting that you had a bad experience with the ATT dongle. my 
parents used an ATT dongle with Ubuntu for a while (don't know the model 
either), and the hardest part of setting it up was finding where she had 
put her passphrase.

if it's reasonably feasible, i'd just suggest bringing the laptop into 
the shop to verify the dongle you get is supported before you sign a 
contract.

Wayne,

FYI - Gales Creek is on the edge of voice and data coverage.  You may 
want to see if their location is even covered.
http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/CoverageLocatorController?requesttype=NEWREQUEST

Verizon 4G in Oregon is only available in a small area around the 
Portland airport at present.

Regards,

Jeff

Yes, I was aware that 4G was only available at PDX at the present, but 
we may elect to get the 4G capable USB device anyway hoping Verizon 
really will "Build Out". They may also get a laptop in the future that 
they will travel with and use the device in other locations.

Thanks for the coverage link, I was surprised with the detail of the 
map, they are just west of Dorman Pond, foliage permitting, etc., they 
may be OK.

Jeff:
Oops, you are probably right. After I initially looked at the map I 
discovered that the map initialized to voice coverage. When I set it to 
data coverage, they may not be far enough west of Dorman Pond to get 3G 
service.

to recover this message. Is that correct?

Sorry ... haven't used pine/alpine in a long time ... does alpine have a 
"Sent" file?  If so, could the message be there? I may be learning more

Oops ... I just found this: "~/mail/sent-mail           Outgoing message 
archive (FCC)." ... so maybe I answered my own question?  If so, then I 
should guess the message is lost, but again ... I haven't used

Thank you for your reply, and the information ... during my use of pine

Fred,

   When I need to save mail to a client/project mbox file I change the Fcc
from sent-mail to that filename. What I must have done was to accidentally
delete that line and not notice until after I sent out the message.

Fred,

   The default Fcc: is 'sent-mail'. Since that message is nowhere to be found
in ~/mail/* I must have hit ctrl-k (to clear that line) before ctrl-x (to
send the message). This time the fingers were quicker than the eyes.

The situation seems to have resolved itself with a couple of rounds of 
the recent upgrades from Ubuntu.
I believe it was a Java thing - something was waiting for a procedure 
using a Java 'class' to come up with an output but if it hung then the 
browser would not complete loading of the page.

So I spent the last couple weeks in 1997-land, texts with choice of font 
size and colors only.

But it seems than much has been restored so far.

Thank you for your replies ... as I thought, I have learned more than 
helped ... sorry ... I suppose having the client (or anyone else if 
there was more than one recipient) send you back a copy is out of the

Fred, Wes, et al.:

   Here's another lesson: alpine stores copies of messages (either in whole
or in part) in /tmp as pico.* (even when the silly pico editor is replaced
with a more capable editor). I found a copy of that non-saved message as
/tmp/pico.53391.bak, saved it to a text file, and will now mail it to myself
for saving.

   It occurred to me early this morning that I should look for it in /tmp and
there it was.

wes,

   I searched my entire mail directory without finding anything. If it wasn't

Now that I find very interesting (-r) ... often my quest is for a file 
(or files) containing some specific piece of text, and the 'find' for 
that isn't nearly as pretty as this.

Which is faster for this purpose (if you know), find or grep?
Thank you

   Find locates files by name or part of the name. Grep searches for strings
within files. Horses for courses (i.e., different tools for different
purposes.)

You are very correct, find by itself will not look inside of a file.

The two each have their own advantages, and additionally, can be combined
for extra power and precision.

See p. 16 of this presentation:

   http://www.deer-run.com/~hal/Unix_Command-Line_Kung_Fu_(OSBridge).pdf

Surprisingly, "find ... | xargs grep ..." is very slightly faster than
"grep -r ...".  Both of these approaches are significantly faster than
"find ... -exec grep ...".

find (the directory you want to start with) -type f | xargs file | grep 
-i text | cut -f1 -d: | xargs grep "the string you want"
... is of course no match for elegance when compared to ...
grep -ri "the string you want" (the directory you wish to start in)
... but the question was (if anyone knew off the top of their head) 
which might be faster ... so off I went to do a little bit of testing ...

Preliminary Results
Context is still the biggest issue ... meaning that neither approach 
magically excludes a long list of somewhat irregular files, and 
therefore each may spew out a large quantity of undesirable stuff to be 
waded through.

"stuff to be waded through" means tweaking the command to exclude most 
if not all of that which is "undesirable" while not excluding that which 
is "desirable".

Short answer ... probably not a good idea to run either one beginning with /

YMMV

Preliminary conclusion ... if you can find what you want the way Rich 
did (by reasoning), that would be way cool!

And a tip of the hat to Hal, as well.

Fred James

   But, reasoning is much slower than a quad-core/4G RAM system. :-)

Subject: [PLUG] crashing a bash shell script with double free memory errors
 on Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 OS
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=soocKZhKaYjM61WCHaP1+B5HXquVyO2fRiHNr@mail.gmail.com>

The following bash shell script seems to constantly crash my AMD 64
Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid OS with a double free memory error on line 4.  I am
running linux v 2.6.32-28-generic on a 64 bit machine.

Can anyone verify this behavior, or is it just my machine that has
this pecularity?

Subject: [PLUG] LibreOffice - Worth the trouble?
Message-ID: <4D540C24.2080608@comcast.net>

Is anyone using LibreOffice?
Did you switch from OpenOffice?
Was there any trouble switching?
Was it worth the trouble?

I've been using OpenOffice, saving documents in .doc or .xls format, on 
my Linux machine for a few years and am satisfied with it for the most 
part. I still like MS Excel 97 on my XP laptop better, but can get by 
with OOCalc. I am annoyed by some incompatibilities between OOWriter and 
MS Word 97. Simple documents convert OK in either direction. But do 
anything unique, like putting the tilde over an n in a Spanish word, or 
use bullets and it's hit or miss when I open one in the other. (I 
suppose it's possible that the more recent version of MS Office has 
"improved" in that regard, but I'm not holding my breath!)

Anyway, what are your thoughts on OO vs. LibreOffice?

Regards,

Dick Steffens

I would look at character sets. Windows is going to force codepage 1252 down
your throat. If you must interact with it, why not use the same character
set in OO?

i've never been a fan of OO, and like others i edit MS Word or Excel 
files in MS apps if they're complex and require 2-way sharing with 
Windows users. OO Impress is quite weak in displaying PowerPoint files, 
so i tend to fire up XP in Virtualbox whenever i need to read a 
presentation.

OO/Libre office are fine for casual spreadsheet and word processing (for 
serious writing i use Lyx, which i learned about from this fine mailing 
list). i hope the new team addresses some of the problems with display 
updating in Writer, it's quite annoying. The UI is functional (moreso 
than the MS Office 2007 "ribbon" nonsense, imho) but ugly.

Switching to LibreOffice on Ubuntu was minimal trouble (thanks to the 
PPA), and worth the effort. The less contact i have with Larry Ellison's 
reality, the better.

Dick,

In my brief experience Libre Office has proved visibly quicker and more
responsive than OpenOffice.org. I've also read that since splitting from
Oracle, interoperability between Libre and MS Office has improved, although
I'm not sure if that extends as far back as '97! If you enjoy the old Excel
style, and assuming you are using gnome, you could try Gnumeric which has a
similar interface to the old Excel style and comparable features.

Why do I look at this and think "buffer overflow attack"?

Fails here using Bash version 4.1.7(1)-release (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu) Linux version 2.6.35.10, AMD 64 X2 Dual Core 4600+.  It's Fedora 14, rather than Ubuntu, but Bash should work the same no matter which Linux distro it's from.

Subject: [PLUG] Is Linux only for nerds?
Message-ID: <1297392247.5141.24.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

This shows how popular Linux has become that this is even a concern now.

I wonder if not having enough information is plaguing kernel developers
still and if this is by and large why you have to be a "geek" to get
Linux to work with computer X containing hardware device Y?

Microsoft is so big and provides the OS for such a large percentage of
the computers on the planet, at least the personal ones, that it isn't
hard to imagine Microsoft having an edge when it comes to knowing the
hardware's design.  In fact, secret agreements between Microsoft and
hardware vendors has long been a problem.

If the design of the hardware is well understood by kernel developers
and enough talent is attracted to the challenge of supporting it,
drivers should be better and being a geek should be less necessary.

I find that there are some annoying aspects of trying to use the latest
computer for a Linux desktop.  For example, anyone have difficulty
streaming video on 64 bit Linux?  Apparently, there isn't a stable flash
implementation yet.  There is work on a free implementation, but I don't
know that the lightspark project has enough talent signing on.  

On my AMD multi core systems, Dirk Dashing which was designed for a 32
bit computer has some major problems.  I've tried to let the writer
know, but he hasn't solved them.  Unfortunately, Dirk Dashing is closed
source and probably always will be.  The outfit that writes a Linux game
should be sensible about supporting it over the long term.  If Dirk
Dashing 1 doesn't work well on my fancy quad core computer, why should I
buy Dirk Dashing 2?  Microsoft has done a lot of work to make sure that
old software, at least popular old software, still works.  This lead
undoubtedly to bastardizing Windows, but it kept Microsoft popular.

I hope that compatibility issues as Linux is getting somewhat obese
and having to adapt to radically different computer architectures
don't kill Linux's popularity in the long run.  In mygamecompany's
defense, Dirk Dashing runs beautifully on a Pentium 4.

There is some work to make Linux as capable of running Windows software
as Windows is, but I hope that that doesn't end up only making Linux
more vulnerable to malware.

There is some commercial software these days for Linux, but I don't see
that that software is ultimately on par with or even directly competing
with offerings for Xbox, PS3, a Windows PC, a Mac, etcetera.

Building Linux From Scratch for an old computer, I have a system that is
much tighter than what you typically see.  Thing is, I've never been
able to build X from scratch and even so, the system won't remain tiny
if I do so.  Building from scratch by the way, painful.  You find out
just how many dependencies there are and how complex Linux has become.

Goal: to execute a block if one or more files exists

bash file test -e will tell you if a single file exists but

will croak with "too many arguments" if there is more than one file


conversly a construct like
    for S in ~/Maildir/.aspambin/cur/*
will attempt to act on a file named * if the directory is empty.

So before I go convert this to Perl and for the learning

    What kind of bash/shell script contruct works on 0, 1, or more files?

# might be a cleaner way, but this should work...
if [ "$(ls ~/Maildir/.aspambin/cur/* 2>/dev/null)" ]; then ...

How about one of the following?:

# doesn't handle files w/ spaces, possible injection
for S in $(ls ~/Maildir/.aspambin/cur) ...

# handles files with spaces and other problematic characters
find ~/Maildir/.aspambin/cur -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 ...

i recently had to turn dma off for my wlan... not sure if an ide 
controller's going to take the same approach, so ymmv. somehow showing 
sounds easier than trying to explain in english this early...

[nathwill at asgard ~]$ cd /etc/modprobe.d/
[nathwill at asgard modprobe.d]$ cat openfwwf.conf
options b43 nohwcrypt=1 qos=0 pio=1

so the "pio=1" bit in that options line for the device module is what 
got my system to quit griping about dma errors. i'm running fedora 14 
fwiw. g'luck.

Looking for a small, relatively inexpensive Atom (or similar) that'd be up

Feedback from a non-nerd 

I'm not a Linux nerd or any kind of computer or technology nerd. I have
nothing against nerds; I just don't want to be one. Or even be thought
of as a nerd. I migrated to Ubuntu Linux years ago after mounting
problems with Windows XP and total frustration with the basket case MS
Vista was. I build my own PCs from scratch with parts from Pacific
Solutions and ENU so I need an OS that does not need to be  installed
and burned-in to flawless behavior by a team of computer engineering
PhDs at H-P or Dell. 

Windows may be great factory-installed but it is far worse than any
Debian distro if you need to make it work well on a home-rolled machine.
Windows refuses to support legacy hardware, probably the cynical
self-serving trade-off Microsoft made with hardware vendors to get that
special inside hardware info.  Why should I junk perfectly good
scanners, SCSI cards and printers to make Microsoft and their hardware
partners richer? Especially when I don't need to.

The non-free nVidia driver works right out of the box with no tuning,
ditto all my hardware 15 years old or cutting edge. I have not had a
problem with Flash since the Jaunty release, the 32- or 64-bit versions.
I use them all the time to access and download music videos and audio
files. Ditto the sound driver, which is more than could say for
Vista.   

I don't do video games apart from passing time with solitaire or the
like so maybe the gamers out there need to  stick with Windows. In fact,
given that a Linux strength is the superior security it offers due to
the comparatively minuscule number of non-Windows machines making Linux
less interesting to the dolts who write and deploy malware, I hope Linux
never seriously challenges Windows' user base. Right now Linux seems to
have the optimum number of users, enough to support a plethora of apps
and drivers but insufficient to attract the mindlessly destructive. May
it always be so!

I'm unsure about your definition of "nerd," but my guess is that an 
extremely large percentage of the American population would apply that 
term to someone who builds PCs from scratch. :-)

My requirements for DSL are to be Covad,
not Qwest, based. 
Covad can get a 3mbps+ signal to my home, Qwest won't
try.

I guess I was thinking of the term applying to people who build their
own kernels or write complex apps in Python or such. What code I write
these days is in bash-shell, yet another advantage I find in Linux vs.
Windows. Nearly everything I need to do can be done with off-the-shelf
open-source apps right out of the repos or, at worst, on the command
line. 

One or two apps may not be there and those I can get and install as
a .deb file, e.g., Googlearth. I have WINE or virtualbox for the rare
need that might mandate Windows but that situation has yet to appear.
For systems that others may use who prefer the look and feel of Windows
7, Vista, XP, Win2K, NT, Win95/98, Windows 3.1, OS/2 or AppleOS, I can
create near twins to those OSes using and tuning the various window
managers available in Ubuntu or other Debian distros.  

I might have been more of a nerd code-wise with Windows, because it had
no useful shell programming. More often than I liked, I was forced to
create something in MS Access or Virtual Basic or Java because the
underlying system was so lame and the appropriate commercial application
was more costly than I thought necessary.

Ditto. I don't know if Qwest has made DSL possible out my way, and I do 
have cable, so I'm not a current Spiritone subscriber; I was back before 
cable came out here. But I always recommend SpiritOne when asked. My 
late mother-in-law was always happy with her SpiritOne service, and I've 
always had good responses from them when I had to call them on her behalf.

JM> Recommendations?

The answer is going to depend on what your problem is.  All DSL is
going over Qwest copper.  If the problem is with the copper, then
switching ISP's won't help.  Some copper terminates on Qwest DSLAMs
and gets forwarded to your ISP by Qwest.  Other copper terminates on
Covad or Integra or maybe some other CLEC's DSLAM and gets forwarded
to the ISP by them.  If the problem is in the DSLAM, then you should
pick an ISP on a different "better" one.  If the problem is at the ISP
(their internal or upstream routing, their services, their customer
service or billing) then you can pick another ISP to try to solve the
problem that way.

I am an Aracnet customer (on a Qwest DSLAM) at home and am fairly
happy.  We have a few outages a year.  Personal Telco has worked with
Integra and generally have good service from them, but they tend to
focus on business customers only (they apparently have a bonded-DSL
service that can be quite fast).  There is Easystreet, Hevanet,
Spiretech, DSL-only.  In the Pearl, depending on where and if you have
room for an antenna, you might be able to get service from Stephouse
Networks over wireless.  I am sure there are others I am leaving out.
There are some Personal Telco nodes on Clear as well, and our
experience with them has been: if you have a strong signal, you are
okay; if you don't have a strong signal then look out!

Comcast is fast, generally, but they are monopolists that don't
respect your freedom.

There is the Alix 2d13 from PC Engines, but personally I wouldn't run
a full-blow desktop/server distribution on it.  Openwrt is small, is
linux, has thousands of packages available, is tuned for running on
flash storage, is robust against sudden power failures, comes back up
in about a minute.  OpenWrt on Alix is what Personal Telco uses at its
heavy-use sites, and it seldom gets above 5% CPU utilization doing
routing, OpenVpn, snmpd and a few other minor services.  It uses a
500MHz x86 CPU, the AMD Geode LX800, has 256Meg of RAM soldered on,
and three "real" ethernet interfaces, it even has a 44-pin
laptop-style IDE port if you really want a spinning platter.  And it
draws around 5W.

Another choice would be one of the Ubiquiti RouterStations, which are
not x86, but OpenWrt supports them well.  As of a year ago, the case
choices weren't as good as for the Alix though.

I have a lot of experience with the Alix and with OpenWrt, I'd be
happy to learn you some of my teachings.

Personal Telco is planning to do a group order from Alix in a few
weeks (when they get stock back in).  Ordering directly from Zurich
tends to be a little cheaper, even with the expensive shipping and
7-10 day shipping time.  If you want, maybe you can get in on that?
If not, there are domestic suppliers, like Netgate, for example.
Google should give you some choices.

He did say he was in downtown/pearl, so the ILEC that owns all the
copper is Qwest.  Yes, in the Portland suburbs, the ILEC is
(typically) Frontier nowadays (post-GTE, post-Verizon).  Qwest is
about to get renamed too, having been purchased (not sure the sale has
closed compleetly) to CenturyTel, based in Louisiana I think.

Message-ID: <4D55E4A3.8040901@frankhunt.com>

Comcastic provided me with a "free" Netgear WNR1000v2 router which 
replaces my old Linksys WRT54G.  I am having trouble getting 
ddclient.conf setup correctly so it can sense when/if my IP changes.  
Looking for some help getting the config right before the IP changes.  
Here's my current config:

I need to change the "use=linksys,    fw=192.168.0.1:80" line and the

You didn't say what Speakeasy is doing that's pissed you off. I am
curious because that's my ISP and I haven't found problems with it.

This 1.5Mbps DSL link stays up 24/7/365, except for infrequent and brief
maintenance hits, and it seems reliable to me, since I use it
constantly, including for remote work at a website based in the UK.

I did notice some months ago that Speakeasy's DNS servers in Seattle
seemed to stop caching website URLs, so I'm running dnsmasq on my PC
behind my firewall, and that appears to be working.

Speakeasy has been owned by Best Buy (shudder) for a while now, but just
as long as my line works and it doesn't hike my rate, I'm fine with that.

So what's changed that is making you want to switch to another ISP?

You ask the phone company (either directly or via an ISP) if they can
provide service at your number (or maybe address).  They have records
will show whether your phone pair is within the number of wire-feet
necessary.  Sometimes those records are wrong, but it's what they
typically go by.

You can contact SpiritOne via the following page:

http://www.spiritone.com/spiritone-services/spiritone-dsl-access/150-what-does-spiritone-dsl-offer

They ask for your name, phone number and e-mail address. They will get 
back to you with the answer of whether you phone line qualifies for DSL 
service.

Message-ID: <20110212090928.196a9c8f@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Google Summer of Code is taking applications for 2011, and the Scribus
development team are actively seeking student applications. Students
will be mentored by one of the experienced Scribus developers. The
program is three months long and students will receive a stipend of
US$5,000, with another $500 to the mentoring organization.

Last summer Scribus mentored three students, resulting in development
of several new features, an excellent educational opportunity for
beginning programmers, and a general win for everyone. 

Of course, if you're not excited about Scribus there are many other
open source projects that will be mentoring students. Last year the
total was in the neighborhood of 3,000 students, so whatever open
source project you're interested in, you may find an opportunity to
participate.

At our office (50th & Division) we were on the outer end of copper reach
from the Belmont switch.  We recently switched to comcast business and our
DSL on that is very good.    At home (Near Univ of PDX) I had comcast and
switched to CLEAR.    They have improved the signal strength and stability
greatly in the last year.   I like it a lot as well as the fact that you can
get a USB Portable modem for $5/mo. and it also works well at most Portland
areas.   The office on NE Broadway has a pretty accurate map that shows
antenna locations.  We did move the home modem upstairs to get a little
better signal shortly after we got it, but the "n" wi-fi has worked very
well with it also.

Looks like Qwest has blocked outgoing port 25 so if you are not sending

Subject: [PLUG] Ethernet patch cable alarm...
Message-ID: <1297559330.2963.11.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I am interested in a specialty part that should be easy to make.  
The problem with patch cables is that they can be unplugged.  I 
have Internet connected lines going to servers where the lines
themselves are filtered by those servers.  If the cables are 
unplugged, the servers are effectively bypassed.  I want an
obnoxious alarm that I can put inside the steel lockbox, one for 
each patch cable.  If you unplug one of these patch cables, the 
alarm goes off.  Better yet, an alarm goes off and no transmission
through the patch cable is allowed until it is plugged back into the
appropriate ethernet card.  So effectively, I want to detect the MAC
address and link status.  Unplug the patch cable, the alarm sounds.
Plug the cable into the wrong computer, the alarm continues.  I want
this to be as loud as a smoke detector.

Does anyone make a 10/100 ethernet switch with an alarm based on 
MAC address feature?  It should be easy to make a device equipped
with an alarm and an AC connection that detects disconnect, but
detecting a foreign computer plugged in is trickier.

This looks like the solution if I go the modular route.  I went the
compiled in route so I don't have to have an initrd.  I'm having to
manually do an hdparm -d 0 /dev/hdg every boot.

What about having the computer from which you don't want an ethernet cable
unplugged make a noise when it is unplugged?

As long as we are drawing in the sky ... an appliance built into the 
middle of the patch cable (in other words, that cannot be disconnected 
from the cable)?  This headless computer could be programmed to know the 
MAC at either end (or both) and sound the alarm should one (or both) not 
be seen ... maybe photograph the un-plugger at the same time.

But seriously, if I may, what is the need exactly?  Are the cables being 
unplugged?  Who is unplugging them?  Why are they doing that?

Wouldn't it suffice, and perhaps be easier, to "cap" the end of the 
cable in such as way as to make non-un-pluggable without some sort of "key"?

As for identifying the un-plugger (if there is a need for that), add a 
network camera to monitor the location.

Any help?
Regards
Fred James

The need in this case, is to protect a content-filtered Internet

A physically locked patch panel cabinet would probably suffice.

Yes, but that is a very expensive solution.  As far as photographing,
that isn't necessary.  What I'm after is a device that goes into a
locked cabinet on one end of the patch cable with an alarm and
the ability to detect the presence of a foreign computer.
I suppose the servers could be programmed to beep, but a locked up
headless device that cuts connectivity and beeps is even better.  
Yes, super gluing the patch cables in place or putting the servers and
Internet equipment in a locked cabinet, these are potential answers.
Thing is, I am leery of the super glue idea where the locked rack 
route is too expensive at this time.

Out of curiosity, how do I program a Linux server to beep when a patch
cable is disconnected from it?

I'm surprised there isn't a smart ethernet switch for doing this sort 
of thing already.

Just to be clear, I have a small locked cabinet.  The problem is, the
servers are outside that cabinet.  So this exposes the patch cables
going to these servers to abuse.  The who is not important, suffice 
it to say that temptation is a difficult issue.  A simple rack by
the way will not necessarily be closed.

I suppose I can whip together a Linux computer that will fit in the
cabinet and replace the switch with that machine...  I have an extra 
P4 processor handy and there is probably enough room in the cabinet
for a micro atx motherboard...  Another option is to use an extra 
K6-III I found lying around.

Subject: [PLUG] Replace ethernet switch with Linux bridge?
Message-ID: <20110213023811.7082w2j7k00s0ksw@web.robinson-west.com>

Is this something that is doable to go from a dumb switch that doesn't care
what MAC addresses are connecting to a smart switch that does?

Currently, my DSL modem is bridged and I have 5 global IP addresses.
I use a Netgear 10/100baseTX 8 port switch to connect all my servers to my
modem.  Question is, can I simulate the switch with a Linux server and
be more careful about which MAC addresses get service?  I also want this
bridge machine to have one of the global IP addresses.  Naturally, I  
want to implement an alarm feature for when and if a foreign computer  
is detected.

Is implementing a smart switch the sort of thing that the Linux  
bridging code is used for?

Sounds awfully like you have a "critical piece" located in a "public 
thoroughfare" ... not generally considered a good idea, but perhaps you 
have reason.  I wish you luck on that one.

But to the question of how: this sort of thing is usually based on a 
"heartbeat" detection program, where one computer queries the other(s) 
about its(their) condition or existence, and preforms a desired action 
(or set of actions) as needed.  That would normally be done over a 
private network using a dedicated NIC in each machine (preferably 
without going through a switch/router, but just a direct connection).  
The reason is traffic of course, but also to avoid the potential of some 
one interfering in some way with the signal.
Any Help?
Regards
Fred James

PS: supper glue?  where did that come from?  did I miss something?  I 
mentioned locking the ends, but I guess I missed the suggestion of 
supper glue.  Locking the ends is done by sliding a close fitting tube 
up the cable to butt the NIC, and then locking the tube in place.  Not 
perfect, but it generally keeps honest people honest.  Possibly honest 
people are not the problem, being located in a "public thoroughfare"?

If they're not *too* motivated, you can cut the narrow part of the release
tab off of the cable head.  That's the part that sticks out when a cable is
plugged in, that you press on to release the cable.  Without that, you have
to use a small tool (small screwdriver, nail file, etc.) to reach the
remaining part of the release tab.  It's more "security theater" than
security, but it's quick, cheap, and might meet your needs.  If your cables
have non-snag boots on them, it'll be even less obvious what you've done.

> Out of curiosity, how do I program a Linux server to beep when a patch
> cable is disconnected from it?

I don't know, but at least some distros show an entry in the syslog when an
Ethernet cable is plugged or unplugged.  Linux has a configurable hardware
event notification system.  Someone on the list probably already knows a lot
about it.  I believe this is the mechanism that also responds to CDs being
loaded, USB devices being plugged and unplugged, etc.  If the external
server OS is trusted, you could probably use this to just have it turn off
the network interface in response to an unplug until someone (you) comes and
fixes it.  One or two cycles of that and people will learn that moving the
network cable breaks the server and doesn't get them what they want. 

The bigger issue is "why are they doing this".   If it's porn, downloading
pirated movies, etc.,  that's a firing offense at most companies.  A memo
from the manager reminding them of that keeps you out of the policeman role.
If it's a legitimate work-related need, then you need to find a way to help
them meet their job needs without circumventing the content filter.
Technology is often not the right solution to people problems.

As in, to get the "smart" switch deal without having to lay out the
money for one?

Well, you can, but there might be an easier solution.  Anyway, first:
you absolutely can bridge multiple ethernet ports together and Linux
will behave like a big switch.  You get the effect of the Linux system
having a single Ethernet card connected to that virtual switch, too.

If you do that you have to ask if the system you are deploying has
access to a sufficient number of Ethernet ports, of course, and also
if you have the bus, memory and CPU bandwidth to deliver sufficient
(ideally, full) rate across the entire switch.

You can add port locking using ebtables or iptables to limit
communication to systems that are in your whitelist (but remember that
the MAC is trivially faked), or something smarter like 802.1x
authentication.

Alerts for new arp stuff could be hung off either the {eb,ip}tables
logs, or off some arp watching daemon.

Anyway, what I would do is just lay out the couple of hundred dollars
to get a switch that would do 802.1x access control, and port MAC
locking, so that you can have fixed ports for things that have real
limits, and just use 802.1x to auth any other port that gets connected
to.

DSL != comcast.  DSL usually refers to a specific family of
technologies that operate on twisted pair infrastructure.  I think you
are using DSL here as synonym for Internet, which isn't really accurate.

It might be confusing to refer to the University of Portland as "Univ
of PDX), since the unreleated Portland State University has the domain
name pdx.edu.  The University of Portland (on N. Willamette Blvd) is a
private catholic institution, its domain name is up.edu.

Also, historically, there were no Linux drivers for the USB dongle
that Clear sells.  So, at least check on that before you buy.

Maps may well be accurate about tower locations.  However, the fickle

I'm not yet a *nix user ;)
But, Windows(tm) volunteers the info that "a network cable is 
unplugged". That seems to indicate that standard hardware can 
detect that situation. I assume *nix is as capable as Windows (I 
duck for cover ;). Monitor that function for a 'change of state'.

Whether to add this to "client" or "server" [terms used *loosely 
;] is left to implimentor.

This is, of course, the concept. But Michael (the original poster) is not a
programmer. He is more asking whether a tool that can be used for this
purpose already exists.

If not, he will probably have to improve his programming skills and write it
himself :)

Actually, I'm a computer science major.  If there is a smart switch that
does 802.1x and MAC filtering, that will be enough.  If it is a couple
hundred dollars, I'm sure I can swing that down the road.  Not a now
solution, but I guess it'll have to do.

As far as a fireable offense, this is a home network which I'm sure many
people have.  That said, what is viewed from this network is still a
concern.

On a non technical note, how do other people deal with addictive
Internet content whether it be: gambling, social media, or 
pornographic web sites (which includes hulu depending on what you
watch).  You can let yourself go of course, but if surfing certain 
types of content is a fireable offense at work, why get in the 
habit at home?  The Internet is not policed at all or pornography
wouldn't be freely available to anyone.  There is such a thing as
decency which broadcast television had mostly observed until recently,
the Grammy's tonight being a prime example.

Everything from inappropriately revealing costuming to sexually
suggestive dancing to inappropriate host comments.  The comments ranged
from I had sex with the next performer to I was smoking Salvia with
Miley Cyrus back stage.  The cavalier attitude about sex displayed at
the Grammy awards is disturbing and in stark contrast with what is
expected of people in the real world.  Maybe in our society there is a
push to treat sex as a performance and a form of recreation, but
sex is not a performance and leaving marriage out of "recreational sex"
is wrong for so many reasons.  The way the Internet and the media are
today, you would think that all Americans are cavalier about sex,
marriage, and children.  I'm sure most of us realize that a majority of
people follow a set of moral principles that demand a very different
attitude.

Just because someone has values, addiction is still a very real danger.
The difference today verses 31 years ago is that the Internet delivers
addictive content at blazingly fast speeds to people in potentially
private spaces.  Add that many Americans live in rural areas or
otherwise find themselves socially isolated in our fast paced modern
world.  The social dynamic that could help alleviate the addiction
danger is gone.  Humans are social creatures, we do better among others
with similar values than we do alone.  Addicts are usually alone,
unseen, and they usually try to hide their problem.  Internet in the
home can be a disaster.

Thing is, a true addict sooner or later will slip up and the addiction
will affect their real life.  This is as true of alcoholism as it is of
a porn or gambling addiction.  Getting fired is just the tip of the
iceberg, people end up divorcing and there are other potentially worse
consequences for addicts.  I realize the home is treated as the castle
where censorship should stop at the door, but the problem with that is
that the Internet takes you out of your house and potentially nothing
you do on it is private.  One wants to be able to follow a value system
whether that means stay behind a filter or whatever that may entail.
Addiction topples a person's value system.  Technical barriers to keep
the honest honest are not solutions to the addiction problem, but these
barriers can help people who are trying to do the right thing anyways.
So much energy has been focused on giving people access to the Net that
I fear little has been done to address what people have access to and
how this will affect both individuals and entire communities.

Linux is a positive outcome of the Internet, but increased proliferation
of pornography is not.  Fighting a billion dollar industry by saying I'm
just going to stay away, I'm just going to leave the filter on.  I won't
look at pictures that are likely to turn me on...  The danger is, you
likely do turn the filter off sooner or later regardless of your values.
The Internet needs to be policed and the sex trade ought to be called
what it is.  Portland residents should be ashamed that there are so many
"Adult" businesses that promote sexual activity.  The problem should be
tackled from the supply side.  Tackling the problem yourself by saying I
won't be a consumer of this, curiosity can trip you up.  The supply of
pornography and other addictive Internet deliverable materials needs to
be reduced.  Yes one can say, "I won't go back for more of this
material," and possibly succeed.  What about people who can't accomplish
this or who haven't accomplished this yet?

Technical solutions like use 802.1x authentication combined with having
another person administrate the actual Internet connection, these
solutions reinforce a person's value system and complement it.  As far
as societal decay in general and the Internet specifically, this is a
broad discussion that needs to happen sooner or later in communities
around the world.  I hope, sooner than later, that law enforcement 
will crack down on the sex trade and other Internet enhanced criminal
activity.  There should be support groups for people who have to use the
Internet on a daily basis who struggle with some of the things the
Internet offers.  If there aren't, maybe this community should form
some.  While were at, we should tell the media that we are tired of
shows like Two and a Half Men and other violent shows.  The less good
clean wholesome entertainment there is, the more people will fall back
on technical approaches to keeping the unhealthy stuff out of their
lives.  The battle can't be won without community effort and attacking
the supply side.

We deal with it the same way as any other addictive item.  We avoid it.
If a person is an alcoholic, they do not keep alcohol in the house.
If a person is a drug addict, they stay away from them.

Just because some people are incapable of controlling themselves does not
mean that we have to regulate the entire Internet.
If you need to filter your home Internet content, there are many dns servers
that you can use that will help.  If you do not have the willpower to not
'sneak in and change back to the normal dns' then change it in your modem's
configuration and set a random password on your modem so you lock yourself
out.  Problem is taken care of...

The problem with "regulating the Internet" is a matter of who's morals do
you want to be restricted to?  What constitutes as obscene?  From what you
have described, it sounds like you want to go back to the wholesom 50's.  Of
course you realize that I Love Lucy was risque because they slept in the
same bed, right?
My point is, that things change and you should do what you feel is right,
but everyone else is doing the same... just seemingly in the opposite
direction as you.  Vote with your dollars and do not watch cable TV,  don't
listen to radio stations that have offensive content, don't go to
grocery/book stores that sell offensive material like Women's Day,  and most
of all.... don't use the Internet.  That should keep you from being exposed
to most of things that are above a PG13 rating.

You could also just move to China, where they do filter most of this content
out.

Best of luck,
Jason

Personally, I find that my own personal responsibility is very easy to use. But then, I've been trained, and I keep my training up. Work is work, and vice versa, Not safe for work content isn't viewed at work. The fact that there's an acronym for this content indicates how much this topic gets discussed. NSFW content is always on the radar.

Some of my places of employment have employed content filters, and most of those were setup with a user usable bypass for the case of the false positive. False positives are logged and could be checked out. Usually, the content filter is in the IT closet, where it's under lock and key, so relatively few people have access to it. Most of my places of employment placed these content filters in place to block content that was accidentally requested, as in the case of a typo, or during an internet search where content was lumped into a search, but was not appropriate. The by-pass is for cases where content IS work related, yet it is inadvertently listed in the filter. I've had both scenarios happen to me. 

While reducing the amount of lost time at work is a nobel goal, is it the job of the IT department to eliminate the chance that people will be people? I think not. The fact that it IS a fireable offense is enough of a deterrent for more folks, and those that it's not, do you really want them working there? Are you really a baby-sitter? We're supposed to be adults, and you have the ability to track traffic. If someone wants to hang themselves, they will find a way.

Also keep in mind the words of Princess Leia. "The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers."

On another note about your inline filter. How are you going to stop people from setting up their own connections to the internet? More and more cell phones are capable of being tethered, and more and more are capable of being wifi hotspots. Several droid models, and the iPhone of Verizon are prime examples.

While the content below WAS written from a work perspective, the very same points work just as well from the home.

I'm not sure the fifties were as clean as people think.

I don't have cable television, don't want it.

DSL modem is bridged, can't solve the problem there.  Besides, Opus
threw out the specs for the modem and how to program it a long time
ago.  This is pre the modem is a wireless hot spot, so no I don't
want a new one.

I think anyone who says self control is the only thing is missing
something about addiction.  Addiction topples self control and personal
values.  The best thing a soon to be addict can do is tell on themselves
and take steps to reduce temptation.  As far as are there cross cultural
values of what is acceptable and what isn't, yes there are.  These
values may not go far enough, but they are a place to start.  I would
like to see the acceptance in society of promiscuity and porn turn
around.  This acceptance fuels the sex trade which is very real.

As far as gambling goes, online gambling is dangerous and perfect for
would be addicts who want to slip under the radar.

One can say, people who look at porn or gamble online just want to
create a problem for themselves.  This is a very cynical view where I
take a somewhat different one.  I think we need to examine the supply
side more and not look at the consumer so much.  Porn viewing and online
gambling are social events.  These events involve potentially millions
of people.  The potential negative effects can be widespread.  Turning a
blind eye because someone may not share my values, where ultimately does
that lead to?  I'm not a pluralist, I reject the notion that all schools
of thought and all value systems are equal.  What kind of society do we
want to live in?  Do we want the kind of society where promiscuity,
conspicuous gambling, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse in general run
rampant?  This is where our media society is, I sure hope our real world
society isn't.  But when does what happens in the virtual world matter
in the real world?

As far as imposing values goes, society imposes many necessary values on
us in order to function.  Why is child porn widely condemned?  Why is
murder in most societies considered a grevious act?  Why is there legal
verses illegal gambling?  Why are payday loan places regulated?  To not
elevate society preserving values above contradictory value systems is
problematic at best, disastrous worst case.  Following society
preserving values starts in the home where Internet addictions can take
hold.  I don't see using technology to fight addiction as babysitting.
I don't see self control as the end all be all.  Self control is the
ultimate solution, but failing to address the direction of society and
the supply side of the problem is a terrible mistake we should not make.

Second paragraph.  The first two paragraphs refer to comments made
earlier in the thread.  The topic is going tangential, but it is still
germane.  Ethics is something that comes up when discussing IT.  My hope
is, people will at least talk about technical solutions.

This probably belongs on Plug-talk, but I'll reply to you one time here.

I don't follow Plug-talk, btw. So if you want to reply please do so via
private email.

Truer words have never been written than "You can't legislate morality."

That also applies to trying to shut down those who profit from vices or
trying to censor the Internet as a whole, or even your own small corner
of it. The name "Portland" reveals that this has always been, and still
is, a seaport town. Think about that for a moment. If you read history,
you'll find that the term "Skid Road" was invented here when they were
still logging the West Hills, and only later it morphed into "Skid Row".

The stories about there having been tunnels beneath a few Old Town bars
that led directly to the waterfront are true. Many one-time loggers got
drunk downtown and woke up on a sailing voyage to Shanghai, China, thus
the term "Shanghaied". San Francisco was more flamboyant in its sinning
but Portland was perhaps just a little more businesslike, and discrete.

I won't go through the history, but suffice it to say that the Memorial
Coliseum was built over a red-light district that had flourished in the
Rose Quarter. Chinatown was once a nest of opium dens and Chinese clubs
mostly dedicated to gambling, and even the Lotus Cafe was at one time a
card club, a block away from the courthouse. Now it is just a lunchtime
cafe for lawyers, judges and juries, but as recently as the mid-1980s I
can recall that it was a dire dive where some drunk shot the bartender,
dead, .357 in the chest just for having told the guy to leave, earlier.

Then there was Bill's Gold Coin, the hooker bar just on the other side
of the facing block from Jakes restaurant, where there's a gay bar now,
or was the last time I looked. The upper floors were a gay 'bathhouse'.

Bud Clark was perhaps Portland's most honest and effective mayor in our
city's history, but consider that he got elected from running the Goose
Hollow Inn, which was a free for all venue for sex and drugs in the 70s
although he did close the place a bit early to encourage responsibility.

Bud Clark lost his first family to a drunk driver, but built the Goose,
so if you want to talk about society and morality you might look him up.

Neil Goldschmidt, on the other hand - Portland's golden boy of politics
and later Oregon Governor and US Secretary of Transportation - had been
fucking his underage neighbor girl while he was in office and continued
to do so for many years. You can sometimes run into him at Goose Hollow
but the woman died recently, a life ruined, and a very long awful story.

Goldschmidt's driver had an affair with his wife, but Bernie Giusto got
the job of Multnomah County Sheriff and he managed to hang on to it for
a long time. He was only forced to withdraw after much of this came out.

The fact is that in Oregon we live on the edge of a corrupt and failing
military industrial empire that's distracting us proles with irrelevant
sex and sports and advertising the tacky consumer gadgets made in China
and sold at Wal-Mart, and it's up to us to maintain a sense of morality.

Every bar you might walk into in Portland has lottery video poker, that
inexorable tax on the innumerate who can't figure out that they'll lose
over time by playing. That the State runs this is exceptionally odious,
but it's a tax on stupidity so I guess the losers deserve the fleecing.

There are stripper bars all over town, "gentlemen's clubs" where you'll
be welcome as long as you keep buying drinks and tipping dancers. There
are also sex clubs, I've heard. You can buy drugs in any downtown club,
and that's not new. It has been more or less the case forever, I think.

And yet, you want to worry about the best way of filtering the Internet
for yourself and your subscribers? Wake up, Michael, we're in Portland!

I think you need to get out more, and perhaps read some of our history.

The bottom line is how you choose to live your life. Want to wank it to
a video? Go ahead. Got a special lady friend you'd like to save it for?
You can do that instead. It's up to you. No women in your life? They're
over 50% of the population, and unlike China, there are girls your age,
and most importantly, you do not need to be the censor for anyone else.

If you have people asking you to censor the Internet, tell them that is
up to them. As in, if you don't want to see it, don't look. That is the
case in real life, and it also applies on the Internet. It's up to them
to live their life and you should not let them put in on you, not ever,
not for business accounts nor most especially for people's home systems.

Just take care of yourself and what you do in your own life, and allow
other people your respectful space to let them take care of themselves.

Best wishes,
Robert

Awesome response!  I would add for the OP that if you really feel like making your router an island unto itself, DynDNS has many free tools to do so.

This isn't the first time Michael Robinson has had trouble following the
rules here. I gather the trouble with this user has gone back to 2004.
It appears to be a recurrent addiction of his.

He received what I thought was a final warning back in November of 2009,
ref http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2009-November/066046.html 

after Keith L. proposed that we campaign for Linus Torvalds for the
Nobel Peace Prize. I quote the entire message here:

Move it to plug-talk.  There are rules.  If you can't follow them
on this list, you are gone.

Michael Robinson is certainly a handful, among other things, but one thing
he is not, is a troll. The sooner you (and everyone) stop engaging him, the
sooner he will stop feeling the need to defend himself.

Keith, while a highly respected member of the PLUG community, is no more in
charge here than you or I. Anyway, this is irrelevant under the
circumstances: it was not Michael who took this thread off-topic, he merely
chose to respond to replies in the same forum which they were posted.
Considering that the replies he is responding to could be seen as a
challenge to his beliefs, it was necessary (from his perspective) to meet
that challenge in front of the same audience which they were presented.

As such, I suggest that it is all our collective responsibility to either
make these challenges via plug-talk, or keep them to ourselves. I realize I
have just violated my own suggested responsibility by posted this to the
main PLUG list.... well, nobody's perfect :)

I'd just prefer you left the Christian rhetoric out of the discussion,
since it could make non-Christians feel out of place on a mailing list
that should be as welcoming as possible.

REMINDER: February PLUG Advanced Topics

BSD (Berkley Software Distribution): Enterprise Open Source From Day One

W&W: Tuesday, February 15th, 7PM at Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Ave

Synopsis:

You use BSD software every day.

Virtually every packet you send travels through BSD-based routers.

BSD gave us the Internet, which gave us Linux and the FLOSS revolution.

The iPhone contains BSD software, as does Andriod.

OpenSSH is a BSD project.

Michael Dexter of BSD Fund will give a tour of how BSD is being used and
discuss why it happily lurks in the shadows of open source. BSD myths
will be addressed along with an open discussion of what the audience is
doing with BSD.

What Christian rhetoric?  Christian realize is a very large umbrella
that covers most people.  Add Muslim rhetoric, Jewish rhetoric,
and rhetoric appropriate to some Eastern religions you have almost
everyone in the world covered.  This rhetoric isn't christian though.
Society sustaining values are not just Christian.

Wow.....

If I'm not mistaken this linux discussion group, this feels as if it belongs
else where http://www.moralgroup.com/
IT is pure simplistic logic and solution therein, not a personal moral
discussion forum, if you have questions about filtering have at, someone
will help.

But adding commentary along the way about your personal feelings is
completely irrelevant and not called for.

If you want to preach, preach about why vi is better than emacs.

The rest is simply inflammatory and trolling.

Very diplomatic Keith, bravo.  I haven't broken any rules here except
perhaps don't irritate anyone's atheistic leanings.  That I've irritated
you without Christian or religious rhetoric of any kind is something.

As far as Portland is a seaport town, that is a valid excuse for
anything goes and the Neil Goldschmidt sex abuse scandal, I respectfully
disagree.

Neil Goldschmidt deserves to be in prison for his sex crimes, but the
system gives him a pass while some priests because they were religious
don't receive one.  Never mind that all of these priests are dead.
I'm not against rewards being paid out in sex abuse cases, but I am
against giving former governors of the state preferential treatment.

The past is the past, nobody I hope is being shipped to Shanghai China
now.  Using the past to justify things going on today in Portland that
aren't healthy for the population, weak.

Refusing to assist with technical approaches that can help people filter
their Internet access, maybe their values are religiously based,
unimpressive.  What kind of coward quite frankly says to his brother,
"it's your problem, solve it yourself?"

I want a name for a switch that does 802.1x and MAC based filtering and
if at all possible a cost.  Barring that, I want information on how to
simulate such a device using a Linux based server. 

If the I want a free operating system problem famously brought up by
Linus had been met with, "it's your problem, solve it yourself," we
wouldn't have Linux today.  Willingness to help your brother with his
problem is both a religious and more than that a community value.
Addressing community problems like sex trafficking and even drug
trafficking on the consumption side only doesn't solve them.  Linus
trying to produce Linux without gnu or anyone else, that wouldn't have
worked.

I would simply point out here that continuing to engage with this

It's not a disscussion I care to continue in any forum.

Subject: [PLUG] PLUG-talk is not a community list...
Message-ID: <1297851440.4133.18.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

Who reads plug-talk?  How many topics labeled not plug appropriate are
there that the person who got the troll label was able to transfer to
plug talk and see anything meaningful come of that?  I have been told
that I preached, that I offended the non religious people, that I'm
foisting opinions on others trying to get a discussion going on how 
to secure a home based Internet filtering setup.  Clearly, some people
are so angry that they have to dig up seven year old posts and they
think they can make a point with them (not that they hold grudges of
course.)

I don't think anyone who is an atheist deserves a nobel peace prize 
and that includes Linus.  I said it seven years ago and I am just as
comfortable saying it today.

Obama is a terrible president no matter what shoes he wears.

The last two paragraphs aren't coming from nowhere by the way, the idea
that Linus should get a nobel peace prize was promoted on this very list
even though there is nothing technical about giving him such a thing.  

The Obama needs new shoes comment, whether plug or plug-talk is where
this was said, the point to take away is how biased the discussion was.

Taking the discussion of how can people work together to filter 
home based Internet access to plug-talk will effectively kill 
that discussion.

I'm not sorry that I pushed the idea that people ought to help each
other when it comes to filtering ones home based Internet access.  I
didn't go on a religious crusade like Keith might suggest nor did I
preach.  The technical side of how people can help each other filter
home based Internet access is completely germane to this list and I
expect people to thoughtfully consider telling me where I can get
an 802.1x enabled network switch.  Better yet, how do I set up the
authentication on both sides of the link?

Subject: [PLUG] combined BSD and Linux security monitor
Message-ID: <20110216161258.GA27805@gate.kl-ic.com>

I was thinking about Michael Dexter's BSD presentation last night.
One of my concerns about software is the insertion of logic bombs.

While open source code is decently reviewed by many eyes, the
review process is unlikely to catch intentional malware whose
behavior is scattered through many interacting  modules.  A
line of code here, a regexp there.  It would be difficult to
make all that add up to an exploit, but not impossible.

So, I assume that well funded agencies with enough brainpower
(US National Security Agency, Chinese People's Liberation
Army, Iranian Sep?h) can, and have, inserted logic bombs in
my Linux systems through seemingly innocent contributions to
open source software.  The insertion process would have to
be continous, and uncertain, as patches introduced by others
might deactivate parts of the behavior the logic bombs depend
on.  An arms race, where one side is trying to hide their
manipulations, and the other side is unknowingly defeating the
manipulations through the general process of code improvement.

I assume different code trees, like Linux and BSD, do not share
enough commonalities for the same subtle exploits to work on
both.  So if the two operating systems are running side by
side, processing the same inputs for the same intended outputs,
a third system could monitor the outputs of both and look for
differences.  This is a very high level abstraction; of course
the outputs and their sequence will differ, even if they follow
the same overall specification.  But if the specifications are
specific enough, the differences will be small and predictable,
and serious discrepancies detectable.  Both systems might have
some of the same overall exploits, but the time-to-exploit would
likely be different.  That should be enough to get attention
and trigger intervention.
  
On a less paranoid level, a "two OS plus detector" system
might be useful for testing code, or looking for failures in
systems needing ultra-high reliability.  Yes, the maintainers
of such systems will need big staffs to deal with a lot of
false alarms, but their code will become very well tested as
the sources of such alarms (bad specs and noncompliant code)
were eliminated.  

While I personally do not have the resources necessary to
maintain multiple OS'es (production Redhat and dabbling
with Ubuntu is all I can manage), those who can support a
heterogeneous collection of systems might consider setting
up some test systems like this. 

So, I'm glad some of us geeks are running BSD!  Keeping that
knowledge alive and ready to spread will be vitally important
in an emergency.

If we geeks ever find ourselves defending the region's
infrastucture from large scale attack, we may need to rapidly
deploy such systems to keep the generators from melting and
the gas pipelines from exploding.  From what I've read, the
US government and military are focused on cyber offense, and
the defense of their own systems, not protecting the general
population.  We are on our own - someday, the people on this
list may save Portland.

There was an open discussion on this topic and Keith had some good
points: monocultures (software or otherwise) are very dangerous if
vulnerable; simply look at "slapper" and other Windows viruses that can
spread at worse to "only Internet-connected Windows computers".

Keith is also right that it is a pain to maintain multiple OS's for the
same purpose. I consider the solution to be a focus on POSIX/SUS, not
RedHat GNU/Linux, Ubuntu GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris, AIX etc... While a
bug could be found in the common standard, it is far less likely than
any one implementation of that standard.

Similarly, stress and security testing suites should be as agnostic as
possible and you may recall how SATAN was the hot test to run back in
the day.

I'm not sure if there is a magic want for this problem, short of
sticking to standards.

I'm not a Linux kernel dev nor even a patch contributor, but my
understanding of the process of getting any code into the
mainline kernel code where said code could to do extensive damage is highly
unlikely. Any code that is submitted to mainline tree is extensively
reviewed by other developers.

So the likely hood that someone unknown person is going to happen along and
inject some malicious code into the mainstream kernel is pretty low. Not
saying it can't happen, the Titanic sank, but the best thing we can do as
users of FLOSS is to keep up w. security updates and know our systems well.
How many people check their log files every day???

So, I wouldn't be so concerned about these types of things at the OS level
but more so at the application level. But even there, you take a
distribution like Debian. A typical Debian testing stage is 2 - 3 yrs before
any new app code gets merged into the stable tree.

I found this preso on this topic interesting...

www.cs.ucf.edu/courses/cot4810/.../Trap_Doors_*Logic*_*Bombs*.ppt

I run Debian on all my boxen and I subscribe to their security announcement
list.
debian-security-announce at lists.debian.org

I see a few of these every day and it gives me sense of (maybe false)
confidence that the code is consistently being tested, reviewed, and
secured...

OpenDNS only solves the filtering issue if you are pointed at the
correct DNS servers.  No Internet service provider that I know of will
force that issue, so there is a weakness between the server that should
force use of the correct DNS servers and the modem.  If you can bypass
the server, you're unfiltered.  If what you have to plug into beyond the
server requires authentication and you don't know the secret, you aren't
toast.  So what I really need is an authenticating switch that I can
lock inside my modem cabinet.  So what is this switch called and what
does it cost?

Nothing you do will be 100%, unless you unplug from the net. So. you need to decide how much risk you are willing to take. This is what every IT manager discusses with the CEO and corporate attorneys. You have it easy, in that you are all three in this case. :)

What you are talking about is a proxy server. There are commercial ones (like netnanny) and I'm sure there are FLOSS ones too.

What you do, is place your 'modem' in your closet. Then put that connection to the system running the proxy also in your closet. The proxy is also your filter. ALL connections go through the proxy server. If you don't allow DNS connections THROUGH the proxy, then those systems inside the proxy HAVE to use the DNS service you offer INSIDE the proxy. 

This won't stop someone that tethers their cell phone, but it does stop any connection you want to stop over the wire you have control over. 

Oh, and you remember that proxy/filter I told you about at one of my places of employment? I showed the IT manager I could bypass it without causing any logs to be created by simply going to a search engine, and looking at the cached content of the search engine, without going to the originating site.

Linux should run just fine on it. Possible trouble areas:

	Suspend/resume
	Compiz for video, depends on the graphics chip
	Battery life

But $350 sounds rather high to me for a machine that sounds like it is
at least four or five years old. Thinkpads are well made, but not
immortal. Check eBay.

All,

I'm looking for feedback on some of the firewall distros/applications 
out there. I've been using Clark Connect 4.1, but I'm thinking I should 
move to something easier to maintain and patch.

I'm looking to see if anyone has used Zentyal, ClearOS, and pfsense. Any 
feedback would be appreciated.

thanks,

I'd look at the current crop of netbooks. It seems to me you can get
one with faster CPU, more hard drive, for about the same price or less,
and it will be brand new. Probably no DVD, though. But Free Geek could
probably scare up a USB DVD drive. And it will be much lighter weight,
easier to tote to school and back.

I don't know if you can get a new netbook without OS or with Linux
preinstalled, but various netbooks have been discussed on the list
numerous times.

After listening to a bit today from PaloAlto networks, they were
claiming to be the only ones to filter the various Enterprise 2.0
applications that go through ports 80 and 443. 

I'm not sure about that, given the talk out there w/r/t "content
filtering," But their option does sound interesting. Not sure how open
source friendly they are, however.

Thanks,
Mike

ClearOS is the replacement for Clark Connect.  It's based on Centos 5.

There is a couple others, untangle - http://www.untangle.com/
Vyatta - http://www.vyatta.com/

Both of these are commercial but are derived from open source so they
offer a free version and source.

Yes, and in fact there are some academic papers out there that
establish this pretty convincingly.  This problem is well studied in
the context of trying to prevent prisoners from passing messages to
one another without being detected.  I've also read papers on how
communication can be achieved just through the timing delays of
packets sent on innocuous data transfers.  If you assume the person 
inside can set up a service outside of the link, there's always a way
to tunnel through.

With that said, there are many legitmate reasons to attempt to filter
traffic to protect people from malicious sites and to try to keep
people from getting distracted at work.  But really, it all just comes
down to a best-effort compromise where you just decide how much effort
is reasonable to keep honest people honest most of the time.

Late to the thread, but I once actually worked on a project which
involved giving prisoners access to the internet (via a work program,
where the nodes were connected with internet-capable computers)....
our solution was based on serious machine, and router-level,
whitelisting, and locking down the hardware. If there's *any* link at
all, blacklisting solutions just don't cut it, as any horny 12 year
old, mid-age oppressed political dissident, or old hacker can tell
you.

I've been running various versions of Debian Linux on my refurbished T60
that I bought for $1500 back in '07. Initially, I had some challenges w. the
ATI Radeo video adpater, Intel wifi chipset, Gigabit NIC, and suspend. But
all of those issues have since been resolved in the mainline Debian / Ubuntu
stream.

Some things to consider...

The Thinkpad is thee most solid built laptop I have ever used. I've been
using my refurbished T60 as my everyday computer for 4 yrs. now w. nary a
hardware problem. I just replaced the keyboard, which I got for free. There
is also a known noisy fan bearing problem. It finally started happening on
mine about a year ago. It hasn't affected the cooling ability of the fan.
The fan can be easily replaced.

I also upgraded mine to 4GB of RAM. For most of us, who aren't actually
doing real computing or graphics intensive tasks, memory is going to be more
important than CPU. The cpu in the T60 is higher performing than an ATOM but
it uses more power.

The key benefit of an ATOM processor, is it's low power consumption. I get
approx 4 hrs on the stock battery, I would expect an ATOM based netbook to
get double that. I have an extra battery I carry w. me that's easy to swap
out.

For any problem I've had be it software or hardware, I've been able to find
the information I need fix it. Because there are lots of people out there
running various versions of Linux on Thinkpads.

There's 2 very good online resources for running Linux on Thinkpads:
http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkWiki
http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/ibm.html

Also, Keith L has a neat thing he's done to the display that greatly
increases the resolution!

So, I say $350 is a good deal. I just bought a 15inch T61 from a guy on
Craigslist for $450. If you don't want to buy it, let me know, because I
will!

Everyone else covered the risk matrix thoroughly, so the only thing that you need as the one gentleman pointed out is to secure the router in a tamper proof location, password protect its maintenance screen, and then prevent your users from being able to adjust ip settings on their accounts.  Honestly, if you are filtering content for people who are "curious" (like your average teenager or employee who is not disgruntled) but not blatantly malicious, it is easy to do, and most likely you have everything you need already.  That is basically what the army does, except for the fact that they can afford realtime monitoring.  If you have the cash to spend and you want a 100% solution, buy an old school marm for each user who isn't afraid to hit adults or kids with sticks and have her stand behind each employee and monitor their usage.  Not the warmest work environment I can think of, but probably adequate for a captive audience such as children.

There is some sarcasm hidden in the above post just in case any think I'm advocating the beating of children... ;)

Here is the     link..

I have bought computers here before and been happy.  They were new
desktop that took Linux with no sweat.  With laptops I was more
concerned because, I have always heard they are a bit harder to get
Linux on at times..

I think I have found a cheaper one..

I'm trying to set up an Asterisk server and I want to be able to use a
standard analog telephone on the far end of an IPv4 network.

Do I want a Linksys SPA2102 NA or a Linksys PAP2 NA?  I'm thinking of
using one of these devices typically used to connect to a VoIP provider
in conjunction with my Asterisk server instead.  For starters, all I
want to do is enable local calling to different buildings/rooms on the
IP network.  

I plan on tying in 2 local phone lines in via the Asterisk server
with a 2 FXO/2 FXS card, but this may not be a right away thing.

Do I use one Linksys PAP2 NA per room or is there a better way to go
about this?

You should be able to use direct ip-to-ip dialing.  You need to set
this up in the configuration of the
ATA device.  If you point them to the asterisk server then your
dialing plan could have the simple
dial codes for all your rooms and even handle your remote ip to ip calling.

If you have your asterisk server register with your voip provider and
set a dial plan in the server
then you could use any phone to do ip-to-ip or out to the outside world.

QWest blocks port 25 if you use dhcp.

If you have a fixed IP address you can turn off port 25 blocking by
going to qwest.net and change the settings for your account.

One other problem you may have is that your outgoing address needs to
resolve correctly for your domain. (I had this problem. The CentOS
version of Postfix kept setting my domain as
"localhost.clueserver.org".) Look at the masquerade rules to fix this.

I have a T61 laptop at work. I have expanded it up to 4 gigs ram and a
500gig hard drive. Works pretty well. I have it running Fedora 14 with
Windows Se7en running in a VMWare instance.  (It is a work laptop.)

It does pretty well. For that price it is a pretty good deal.

I have a few scripts which I run at logon.  I set this up some time ago, but
as those of my vintage may understand, I have forgotten how I set them up.
 Searching, I find that with Ubuntu 10.04 there is a GUI:  Systems,
Preferences, Startup Applications.  All the many things which get launched
are there--21 of them if I counted correctly.

My question, for the sake of curiosity only, is where is this list stored?
 I have been advised to Check with Google for the answer.  But I have been
unable to pry the answer out of Google's clutches.  Can somebody here either
direct me to the file(s) which contain the data displayed in the GUI, or
suggest what magic words might open Google's tight fist?

Thanks,

There is a set of directories in Ubuntu in /etc/rc*.d
Each of these refer to different states and different levels of running the
system.

If you want to add something, you probably want to put it into /etc/rc.local

You also have a choice to do this at the login level and to have it startup
when you run a shell, in which case you would put it into your home
directory in a .rc file for your shell. This is best if you are running
something you want set for command line services. As opposed to system or
GUI services.

That app is gnome-session-properties. It will start stuff described
with a desktop entry in:
/etc/xdg/autostart
~/.config/autostart

As a special added attraction for tomorrow's Clinic we will have a
Canon LiDE 30 scanner to dissect. 

I purchased this scanner new several years ago and it worked well for
the occasional use I gave it. However, it recently developed a problem
where it scans only the left side of a page. The other side of the page
comes out solid black. I suspect a hardware failure, but it could be as
simple as a loose wire. I plan to take it apart at the Clinic. If we
do succeed in repairing it I will be happy. If it's not repairable, no
loss, and we will have gained some knowledge of how scanners work.

   It's political! Obviously, because the scanner lives in Portland it
detests the Right but will scan the Left very progressively. They probably
have scanners that don't work on the Left up in Walilla, AK.

I don't know about the price, but I had a T60 at work and it worked 
flawlessly with Linux.

Message-ID: <20110221213731.GA17086@gate.kl-ic.com>

I have a few T60s, some built from portions of other T60s.  I plan
to keep using them until somebody starts making 4:3 screens again.
No major Linux problems, some minor video sluggishness, possibly
due to the older video drivers available for my slightly older
distro (RHEL5.4 clone); possibly also due to a 2048x1536 screen,
causing more time to render.

The T60 docking cradles suck.  Which is sad, because docking
cradles are a good way to reduce wear on the ethernet ports.  
The AC adapter socket is on a pluggable cable, so if that wears
out it can easily be replaced.  Much better than laptops with
the AC adapter socket soldered to the main board - a significant
source of stress.

Regards the T61, there is a known flaw in the manufacturing - poor
chip attach inside the graphics coprocessor, which means that over
the years many of the chips will come loose and the video (internal
and external) stops working.  Unrepairable - there is no source of
replacement graphic coprocessors, and replacing large surface-mount
modules is close to impossible.

There were problems with some of the T30s, where the second memory
socket would fail.  Again unrepairable, not quite so catastrophic
since a 2GB SODIMM will fit the other slot.  I don't know about
other recent Thinkpads, but most have extensive communities online. 

A warning - most Thinkpads can have passwords enabled for the BIOS. 
It can be very difficult to discover or remove these on a used
laptop, and in some cases renders the main board useless.  Never
buy a used Thinkpad unless you can see the BIOS Config page (depress
F1 during boot) and you can research the model number and BIOS version.

Surprisingly, items like CPUs, screens, backlights, etc. are 
replacable - though most repair shops can't do it.  Screens can be
swapped from other brands, the cable connections are surprisingly
standardized, though you may need to reflash the EDID info with a
Windoze program, "powerstrip", so the BIOS will recognize it.  You
can also swap out the whole main board, but if there is a limited
lifespan part soldered to it, the replacement main board will
probably have the same problem (and cost too much).

Before buying any used laptop, use google to find out about other
people's experiences.   If you see the same flaws cropping up over
and over, this may be a manufacturing defect, limiting the lifespan
of every unit made.  Thus, 2007 manufactured laptops may outlast 2011
manufactured laptops, if the 2011 laptops are flawed.  Sadly, many
wearout flaws don't become common until after the warranty expires.

This is exactly why I still use a laptop from 2003. I keep buying used ones
of the same model to steal parts from. I will continue doing this until
either my computing needs overrun the laptop's functional limitations, or
until the interweb runs out of parts for me.

my screen does 1920x1200 and I can run for 7 hours on good batteries (the
optical drive is swappable with a battery, floppy drive, and I'm sure other
things).

It's a dell d800. this sucker is OLD, but it just refuses to die. I also
don't need a cooling pad on the bottom, as I have thus far been unable to
overheat it. I have no problem letting it sit on a cushy blanket or pillow
for hours, and then it can go straight on my lap without a subsequent need
for application of burn cream.

The hingest are starting to wear a bit, and the screen doesn't get as bright
as modern models, and some of the thinner parts of the casing are starting
to develop cracks, and the bottom corners of the screen have broken off
completely at this point, but these are all minor cosmetic things caused
more by my abuse of the poor thing than by normal wear & tear. Plus, they
are all easily fixable by buying one with a broken screen or something and
swapping them out.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1102211452220.15851@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Despite looking again at the sed/awk book, I don't see how to write a
functioning script. The input file is 39M (almost 111K lines) and sed it the
right tool for the job.

   I need to change the delimiter character in a CSV file from ',' to '|'
whenever it appears between two digits, and not if the subsequent character
is a space or letter. I _think_ that I have the pattern properly expressed,
but I fail to get the single substitution of a '|' for a comma within the
run of digits.

   In English, I want to locate one or more digits followed by a comma and
one or more digits, then replace only the comma with a pipe.  What I've
tried include:
 	s/.*[0-9],[[0-9]/\&|/g

but this puts the entire pattern string in the output followed by a pipe. My
lack of regex knowledge on the substitution using part of the pattern
hinders me in emacs and grep, too.

   Clues needed.

   More searching with Google lead me to this:

"The section explains how to do the apparently complex task of moving text
around within lines. Consider, for example, the output of ls: say you want
to automatically strip out only the size column-- sed can do this sort of
editing if you use the special \( \) notation to group parts of the regular
expression together. Consider the following example:


 	sed -e 's/\(<[^ ]*>\)\([ ]*\)\(<[^ ]*>\)/\3\2\1/g'

"Here sed is searching for the expression \<.*\>[ ]*\<.*\>. From the chapter
on regular expressions, we can see that it matches a whole word, an
arbitrary amount of whitespace, and then another whole word. The \( \)
groups these three so that they can be referred to in <replace-text>. Each
part of the regular expression inside \( \) is called a subexpression of the
regular expression. Each subexpression is numbered--namely, \1, \2, etc.
Hence, \1 in <replace-text> is the first \<[^ ]*\>, \2 is [ ]*, and \3 is
the second \<[^ ]*\>."

   So, I tried

 	s/\(.*[0-9]\),\([0-9]\)/\1|\2/g

but nothing was changed. Perhaps closer, but still not there.

Rich,

# sed -e 's/\(<[^ ]*>\)\([ ]*\)\(<[^ ]*>\)/\3\2\1/g' < 
<filename.with.commas> > <another.filename>

sed is a stream editor.  You need to create a stream.  '<' is input 
file. '>' is the output file.

First, since your're interested in <DIGIT>,<DIGIT> why match anything else?

Second, I don't do sed, so here's how it can be done in perl


#!/usr/bin/perl

while(<DATA>) {
    s/(\d),(?=\d)/$1|$2/g;
    print;
}

__DATA__
work with 19,43  or so
14,99
we have, at most, 14,23 to do though some say it is 18,44
Without digits, all the , will remain.
With digits 9, Ah ha! or
With,3 no change for a 2nd line
But again 3,4,5,6 all have bars.
^^^^^^^  produces vvvvvvvvvvvvvv

Which I believe covers the cases you described. 
Cut #!/usr/bin/perl through the line starting }
remove the DATA text and you can run it on your data.

And after a bit of poking around I now know a little bit more about perl.
Change that to:
#!/usr/bin/perl

while(<DATA>) {
    s/(\d),(?=\d)/$1|/g;
    print;
}

Fred, John, et al.:

   Yes. Somewhat. And why not totally I don't -- yet -- understand. It does
make sense that if characters are going to be grouped in the pattern part of
the expression, then all characters need to be grouped. Including the single
comma. Per John's suggestion I dropped the '.*' (intending multiple digits
preceding the comma), yet not all instances of the pattern are substituted.
The first lines of the input and output files show this.

   Input:

   The first five instances of the pattern have the pipe substituted for the
comma. Yet, in the middle of the second line (0,2 and 1,2.00) are not changed.
In both cases the preceeding pattern is a single digit rather than 2 or more
digits.

   Almost there!

That's because the leading 0 in 0,2 and the leading 1 in 1,2 were part 
of the previous match.  Sorry, I'm not sure what the correct solution 
is in this case.

Running the command twice against the input, cleared up the stragglers.  
The SED file would look like this ...
{
        s/\([0-9]\)\(,\)\([0-9]\)/\1|\3/g
        s/\([0-9]\)\(,\)\([0-9]\)/\1|\3/g

Galen,

   Aha. So if there's a succession of matched patterns then the search
proceeds after the last matched character. That makes sense now that you
explained it.

   Seems to me that multiple passes should do the trick.

Thanks very much,

Fred,

   I was going to run the script manually. However, your suggestion makes
sense.

   Is there a way to determine, a priori, how many passes might be necessary
in any such file?

Many thanks,

   Thinking about this, two should be sufficient. It is for my data file, at
least. Now the only commas are within text strings.

   Thank you all for enhancing my understanding of sed.

Worst case scenario ...
    1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
... after pass one ...
    1|2,3|4,5|6,7|8,9|0
... after pass two ...
    1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|0
... so you are correct ... "two should be sufficient" ... a third pass 
would be unnecessary, but harmless (other than overhead).

In case of concern (wanting to check, for example), vi the file and do a 
search for the pattern ...
    /[0-9],[0-9]

Hope that helps

Subject: [PLUG] Yocto Project seeks local testers - free food/beer!
Message-ID: <4D63E7EE.5020404@zenlinux.com>

Hello all,

I work with some folks at Intel who are really passionate about embedded
Linux development. We've been working on the Yocto Project, a build
system and set of tools you can use to create embedded Linux
distributions. If you're familiar with OpenEmbedded or Poky, we are
based on these projects.

http://yoctoproject.org

One of the things we're adding to this system is an Eclipse-based
development environment to help accelerate the creation of embedded
Linux userspace applications and Linux-based products.

We'd like to get some feedback from people about how well our tools
work, and as such we're going to sponsor a little get-together for some
folks who want to be our "guinea pigs" to try out our software. We're
asking for informed opinions about what we're doing and how we could
improve, and in return we will be providing free food and tasty
beverages (yes, I mean beer).

This gathering will be one evening in late Feb/early March. I'm thinking
that the SE Lucky Lab function room would be a good spot to hold this -
but this isn't set in stone and in fact is open to suggestions by those
who would like to attend.

In order to keep this session focused and productive, I'm looking for no
more than a dozen people to participate. One or both of the following
things should be true:

* You've done embedded Linux development before (or are quite familiar
with the process - perhaps by setting up a router with OpenWRT and
customizing it)
* You are familiar with an IDE that runs on Linux, particularly Eclipse

We would be open to having 1 or 2 people join this who may not have an
embedded background or Eclipse knowledge, but you should be a software
application developer and well-versed with your build tools.

You have to be willing to do some "homework" first by setting up Eclipse
with our plugin. Here's information about where to obtain the plugin and
a screencast which demonstrates some basics of using it:

http://yoctoproject.org/projects/eclipse

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZlOu-gLsh0

To be clear, this isn't intended to be a "training" course on how to use
our tools. We're looking more for what your initial impressions are
about using these tools and observing how you'll attempt to do a few
things with them at the event. Of course we'll be happy to answer
questions in-person and on our mailing lists.

Does this interest you? If so, please drop me a line (off-list) and we'd
be happy to buy dinner and drinks!

Thanks,

Scott Garman

And neither should be used.  Instead, harden your sshd.  Simple.
Effective.  Having said that, I don't run sshd on port 22, and have not
seen *any* scanner hit my sshd in months, even though I was getting
routine (daily or hourly) attacks on 22.

In other words, you don't need port knocking.  Just be slighly uncommon,
and you're good to go.

Is this security through obscurity? 

Yes.

Does it work?

In combination with good practices, yes.

The same way that Linux and other *nix based OSes are smaller targets and in turn, not as inviting. There are a LOT of targets out there on port 22, and if you know how to change the port sshd listens to, you probably know how to make sshd more secure as well.

It (might) reduce overall risk, but it doesn't...

...improve security.  You are frobbing the likelyhood side of the
equation instead.  Also, there are ... well, rather a lot of attacks
on Linux out there, and it is an inviting target.  The profile is
different to Windows, but I don't honestly know that there are less
attacks.

Daniel

Last time I counted the CVE stuff showed that Win32 and Linux were
about even in terms of vulnerabilities, at least, and that you were
much more at risk if you used something outside the big three distros,
or Win32.

I don't really want to reincarnate this thread, but I think we're
talking at two completely different levels.  What I mean is that I'm
trying to discuss the theory of what you *could* do with a very large
address space, while many of you want to discuss the concrete problem
of protecting SSH.  That's just one example of an application of one
example protocol.


You are right in that changing your default port typically
accomplishes the goal of stopping most ankle-biters from guessing your
SSH passwords.  But really, you're far better off just requiring your
users to use SSH key pairs and disable password auth.  Or you'd be
better off requiring them to use OTP. Unfortunately, all of these,
including port knocking, require clients to do something different
than what they are used to.  They either require them to set up ssh
keys (very good idea, but most people don't grok public key), use a
different port, or have a list of passwords in their pocket.  Port
knocking requires some kind of special client.

While the proposal I have made doesn't require any of this, (it simply
requires knowing an obscure domain name) I'm not necessarily trying to
focus on SSH alone here.  There are many situations where you simply
don't have the resources to properly harden a semi-vulnerable service
(IPSEC, PPTP, etc), but that service doesn't necessarily need a whole
extra layer of real authentication.  You're merely trying to cut down
on resource utilization or reduce the noise in your firewall logs.


And then taking another step back, there are other fun things you can
do with the huge address space.  Embed part of the hash for your
public key in the last bits of the IPv6 address to help clients
automatically look up your IPSEC/other key.  (Something like this is
used in some proposed protocols that I'm not intimately familiar
with.)

You typed "more" where I think you meant "less".

Linux holes are far more useful to exploit than say, FreeBSD holes,
simply because there's far more Linux out there.

And I dare say, Linux is also a bit leakier, unless you're running
the almost useless SELinux.

See OpenBSD's completely sane claim of having had only two (three?)
remote exploits in over a decade.  The average time between remote
exploits in Linux is measured in months.

No, I meant more: smaller distributions had known vulnerabilities for

I gathered far less data on this, although my recollection is that the
*BSD group were generally about as risky in the "real world" ? once
applications were installed from ports ? as Linux was.  Their base
system was usually much smaller, so had less holes, but it didn't help

They carefully limit that to only their core distribution; your
comparison would be the absolute minimal Debian installation, rather
than the standard one.  That said, they may well be more secure.  I
was loose in my comments above, which I mostly intended to refer to
Linux, and commercial distributions.

No, I meant more: smaller distributions had known vulnerabilities for

Subject: [PLUG] Fedora 14 vs. 2005 laptop
Message-ID: <20110224222654.GA28788@gate.kl-ic.com>

At the Clinic on sunday, a fellow brought in his Compaq R4000 
laptop, and a Fedora 14 install disk, intending to combine
them.  The R4000 is a large beast with a big screen, but
the RAM and disk and optical drives on the various R4000
versions range from pretty good to pathetic. 

Unfortunately, his R4000 had 200MB of RAM, a 40GB hard disk, and
(I'm guessing) a 4X CDROM reader.  He wanted to split up that
hard disk between WinXP and Fedora, and had used Partition Magic
to make two 5GB partitions for Fedora.  He was upset that Fedora
would only install a minimal text-only system. 

I had other people to help (including a fellow who drove up
from Salem at my invitation) so I did not figure out why.  I was
trying to steer him towards Damned Small Linux but he was having
none of it.

According to the Fedora website, the minimum install requirements
for Fedora in RAM is 256MB for text and 384MB for graphics, with
512MB recommended.  A complete set of packages could occupy as
much as 9GB of hard disk.  I knew that 200MB was too little, but
I was unaware that Fedora would automagically install text-only
in these circumstances, and refuse to install graphically when
the space was not available.  So I could not get the fellow to
the "look, this doesn't work, you need more RAM or a leaner 
distro" realization.

One of the harder tasks at the clinic is convincing people that
their older hardware won't run newer distros.  Yes, there is 
ten tons of free candy in that big pile, but you are not going
to carry it all home in your little red wagon. 

It would be good to have a discussion of the latest supported
distros and applications for older and smaller machines.  As
M$ turns a cold shoulder to folks with older hardware, we
have an opportunity to gather lots of refugees.  Conversely,
for many devices (pocket computers) the emphasis is moderate
capability consuming miniscule power.  Those can also benefit
from the leaner distros.

Keith,

   The minimums for Slackware-13.x are:

It will run on systems as far back as the 486. Below is a list of minimum
system requirements needed to install and run Slackware.

     * 486 processor
     * 16MB RAM (32MB suggested)
     * 100-500 megabytes of hard disk space for a minimal and around 3.5GB
for full install
     * DVD drive

Additional hardware may be needed if you want to run the X Window System at
a usable speed or if you want network capabilities.

   Running Xfce rather than KDE (even though the former is bloating not
everything needs to be installed) keeps the X requirements down.

   I ran Slackware (and earlier version) on my Toshiba Portege with 96M RAM
(including Xfce for the X Window System).

Several thoughts come to mind:

1) The Compaq R4000 can take up to 2 GB of RAM, and hard disks plenty
large enough. It also comes with nVidia graphics that can drive a
screen up to 1680 x1050, although not all R4000s come with that kind of
screen. My point is that the gentleman in question could easily upgrade
his R4000 to at least enough RAM to do the job, at a fairly cheap price.

2) The Compaq R4000 was my first Linux computer. I bought it brand new
from Compaq. This was back in the day when Breezy was the reigning
version of Ubuntu. I brought it to a Clinic at Riverdale School and,
after a couple hours of futzing with various 64-bit distros, I finally
got the screen running at 1680 x 1050 with Breezy. I later returned the
R4000 to Compaq after discovering that it was impossible to get the
wireless working, not even ndiswrapper would work. I replaced it with
an R3240, which served me well for two and a half years until I gave up
due to a hardware fault in the motherboard.

Having said all that, my R4000 (and R3240) came with 60 GB hard drives
and 2 GB RAM, because that is the way I ordered them.

3) You say his R4000 had 200 MB RAM, but that sounds odd. There are two
slots, so he could have had 192, 256, or some other multiple of 64, but
I don't see how he could have 200 MB. Not that it really matters, as
none of these numbers is sufficient. In fact, I can't imagine that it
would even run Windows if it has only 200 MB. (It comes with 32-bit
XP).

It would also be good to have a few RAM chips that we could sell to
people like the gentleman with the R4000. In practically every case
where we have had someone bring in an underpowered computer, the
computer could have taken additional RAM, if only we had some
available. Too bad I gave away the two 512 MB chips that I had. They
would have solved the problem with the R4000 right off.

I need to make a trip to Free Geek to donate a few items. Perhaps
before the next Clinic I can pop into the thrift store ask what kind of
RAM they have available and pick up a few miscellaneous sticks.

If if you could get a lightweight distro installed chances are it's not
going to be all that useful to the person. It will be less user-friendly and
they won't be able to install very many apps.

  One of the harder tasks at the clinic is convincing people that

Don't confuse "newer" distros w. lightweight vs. fully loaded distros.
Puppy, DSL vs. Fedora, Ubuntu. There are plenty of good lightweight distros
under current development.

Might I also suggest live cds of some lightweight distros and/or running
some of these lightweight distros in virtual box so people can give them a
test run.

Agreed! I think I have some 512M sticks laying around from when I upgraded
my T60. I would totally rather have them be used in a newly minted PLUG
Linux Clinic computer than just collecting dust... :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Retrieving Mailman subscriber lists from backups
Message-ID: <20110226034340.GA1579@gate.kl-ic.com>

Not a problem, but a solution.  I wish I could have saved
an hour by finding this same solution via Google.  Maybe
posting this will save someone else an hour.

The important information:

  The subscriber database for Mailman is stored in the file:
  /var/lib/mailman/lists/[listname]/config.pck


The details:

I used to be volunteer webmaster for another organization. 
Mailman, wiki, some online forms, and some static http content.

The president of the organization got increasingly demanding 
about doing things his way, and my time commitments got too
crazy, so I said "Do it any way you want.  I will not be your
webmaster in 6 months" about a year ago.  I actually pulled
the plug on the site and the mailing list in November.  Then
El Presidente complained that Mailman was still sending out
subscriber password reminders, so I used the Mailman "rmlist"
command to zero out the list (saving the archives, while
removing the config files) in January.

Yesterday, El Presidente asked for the subscriber lists. 
A month after I deleted them.  Fortunately, I have nightly
backups of my server going back for years.  Unfortunately,
I could not find any documentation saying which file[s]
actually store the subscriber information, or their format. 
I spent about an hour Googling, and found nothing.  

Why, why, WHY don't programmers document their architectures?

I found that REMOVING the /var/lib/mailman/lists/[foo]/ directory
for another still-existing Mailman list "[foo]" caused the
Mailman command "./list_members [foo]" to fail.  I put the [foo]
directory back, and pulled the [deleted] directory for the deleted
list off the backups.  With that, I could run the Mailman command
"list_members [deleted]" and send the resulting file to El
Presidente, then remove the [deleted] directory again.

Okay, that wasn't documented on the web, it is now.

Keith

Subject: [PLUG] Speech-to-text Applications for Linux?
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1102260657260.16365@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My Google searches find a number of text-to-speech applications (including
some for emacs), but not speech-to-text applications. There seems to be some
work on toolkits useful for application developers (such as the toolkits
being developed at CMU), but not much in the way of working applications.

   Does anyone here know of applications that run on linux and can transform
speech into text using any editor? By "any editor" I mean it doesn't matter
what the written portion uses not that the software need work with any text
editor.

   I believe a couple of subscribers know folks who use or need such an
application so all suggestions and pointers would be helpful.

Subject: [PLUG] Device is read-only
Message-ID: <20110226090104.14d57993@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I should know how to do this, but I don't. Or maybe it can't be fixed.

The computer is a Thinkpad T61 with Fedora 14, x86_64. The device is a
Transcend 32 GB SDHC card. According to dmesg it mounts automatically
when inserted at /media/FC30-3DA9/. The filesystem is vfat, which is
how it was formatted when I bought it. Any attempt to copy files to it
results in "the device is read-only."

The card has a slider on the side to lock the card, reminiscent of the
slider switch on ancient floppies. But it doesn't matter which position
I place the switch in, I cannot copy files to it, either with Nautilus
or from the command line as jjj or as root. According to Nautilus I am
the owner of the device.

As root I can umount it and then mount it again. But if I mount it with
the -w switch it gives me an error message that the device is read-only:

[root at Devil8 media]# mkdir SDC
[root at Devil8 media]# mount -w /dev/mmcblk1 /media/SDC/
mount: block device /dev/mmcblk1 is write-protected but explicit `-w'
	flag given

And curiously, even thought I told it to mount the device
at /media/SDC/ it is mounted at /media/FC30-3DA9. From a plain mount
command after mounting it as above I get:

/dev/mmcblk1p1 on /media/FC30-3DA9 type vfat
(ro,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks,uid=500,gid=500,shortname=mixed,
	dmask=0077,utf8=1,showexec,flush)

Maybe the device is defective, like the slider switch is not unlocking
it? Maybe I don't know what I'm doing?

I ran into this problem recently it turned out to be the permissions on
the dir it was mounted to that were the issue for me.

I think it is just defective. 

[root at Devil8 media]# umount /dev/mmcblk1p1
[root at Devil8 media]# mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /media/SDC/
mount: block device /dev/mmcblk1p1 is write-protected, mounting
	read-only

At least now I can get it mounted in the SDC folder that I created for
it. But mount insists that it is write protected, regardless of which
position I put the slider switch in.

The Mailman "dumpdb" script will deserialize and pretty-print a
config.pck (a python "pickle" file), i.e.:

python /usr/lib/mailman/bin/dumpdb /path/to/list/config.pck

I agree this could be better documented.

somewhat belatedly I know...)

Actually Free Geek uses stress_test which is just a shell wrapper around
stress that specifies the length of time it runs and what is does.

Stress itself can run for arbitrary lengths of time and has lots of
tuneable parameters that effect how much you stress stuff, and what gets
stressed.

Subject: [PLUG] Broken Sony Vaio PCG-691L
Message-ID: <20110226182603.7ba77436@mailhost.pdx.edu>

While visiting with a couple of friends this afternoon they showed me a
Sony Vaio PCG-691L computer that is broken. The problem is that the
power connector is kaput. The battery is currently dead, but they told
me that even when it was charged the computer would not boot. They took
it to RedTop <unknown to me> computer repair who advised them that it
was unrepairable. One of the two took it apart a bit but was unable to
determine if it was a broken wire or exactly where the problem resides.

I wrote down the following from the bottom of the case:

Model	PCG-691L
P/N		28155130
Ser #	3221143
ATI Mobility Radeon 9200

They are aware that I am part of the Linux crowd and they asked me if I
knew anyone who could fix it. I advised them that I could install Linux
on it for them, but if there was an insurmountable hardware failure I
would not be of much help. However, I also said that I would query the
group to see if anyone had any suggestions. 

They have another laptop and a desktop computer, so this computer is
unneeded, but they'd like to have it working again. I might get them to
use it as a computer to learn Linux on (they are both interested in
Linux), if only it could be repaired.

Suggestions?

as you know, laptops aren't very modular, nor standardized, so it's tough to
troubleshoot hardware problems. That said, if it showed up at the clinic and
I'm able to be there, I would give it my best shot.

what I usually do on these is look for one of the same model with a broken
screen or something on ebay and steal its parts to make one working unit.

John,

   A few times I've taken notebook/laptop computers to Northwest Computer
Support off 217 (10240 SW Nimbus Ave Ste L7, Portland, OR 97223;
503-684-3280). They've done excellent work, told me the problem and cost
before doing the repairs, and were reasonably priced.

   While it's a long haul from out here I will go back to them if I need
service on a portable computer.

   Of course, Wes's price is going to be much lower than NCS's price. :-)

Marvin,

   1.) Science ain't exact ... until the politicians get to it.

   B.) Gravity is often the cause of broken laptops.

I guess my question is what does this mean 

-- a common problem with many systems that are too light is the power
jack on the laptop side, something which I gather can be resodered from
a new jack. 

With the battery, when the computer powered up, could they get to a BIOS
menu, or was there anything POST-like on the screen (or in audible
beeps).

When I had a Sony years ago (a PCG-GR290), I got a used docking station
-- and was able to power it up (and even recharge the batteries) through
that. It worked fine for a couple of years after, until I eBayed it (I
no longer have the docking station)

Thanks,
Mike

My daughter dropped off a Sony Vaio laptop several years ago that she'd
used at college, saying it wouldn't turn on anymore and she thought the
power switch might be broken. I never tried to get it fixed, because it
was about six years old by then and she didn't seem anxious about that.

But maybe it's just the power switch on your friends' Sony Vaio laptop.
If so, and Sony used the same switch for years, it might not cost much.

Robert

PS - If anyone wants a couple of old P3 laptops, that Sony Vaio and an
HP Omnibook 6000 with a dead hard drive are both *free* for the asking.

I searched on eBay and there are at least half a dozen sellers offering
DC power connectors for prices under $10. I am guessing that this is a
common failure in this particular laptop. I told my friends to shop on
eBay and maybe they can fix it themselves. There is also a seller
offering a diagnosis for $10, cost of repair to be determined after he
has it in his hands and has looked at it. If he can't fix it the
diagnosis is free. One way or another it looks like their PCG-691L is
repairable.

Now, if I could just get them to put Linux on it.

   Twenty years ago I had a Gateway portable that was designed and built for
them by TI. The internal power supply failed at 13 months (with a 12-month
warranty, of course). I paid to have it repaired and when the same thing
happened a second time the company admitted the power supply was a poor
design and they were failing just after the warranty periods for many
suckers ... er, customers. At the third failure I got rid of that computer
and never bought another product from Gateway.

Subject: [PLUG] IPTables question
Message-ID: <4D6BCC40.20709@frankhunt.com>

I want to block an entire class A address set and then allow a few of 
the addresses within that set to have access.
I figured I could block all the addresses in the set then allow the 
specific address(es) that I want.
Like this:

iptables -A INPUT -s nnn.0.0.0/8 -j LOG --log-prefix "IPTABLES DROPPED"
iptables -A INPUT -s nnn.0.0.0/8 -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -s nnn.0.6.135 -j ACCEPT

But

It is not working and I can't figure out how to do what I want.

Thanks,

DROP

DROP is a terminating target - once it is used no other
actions occur.

Reorder your rules to put the ACCEPT first and you
will get the behavior you describe wanting:

iptables -A INPUT -s
nnn.0.6.135 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -s nnn.0.0.0/8 -j LOG
--log-prefix "IPTABLES DROPPED"
iptables -A INPUT -s
nnn.0.0.0/8 -j DROP

Subject: [PLUG] How to Troubleshoot a Dead Machine
Message-ID: <4D6C287E.2030003@gisnet.com>

My super-cheep China-made PC clone running FC5 died last weekend after a 
power failure and the disc drive was off for a day or two. It never 
recovered. When I powered up on Monday, the CPU fan would switch on 
normally and that's all it  would do. No boot, didn't even get to grub. 
Everybody in the office here told me that it was the motherboard. Well I 
have backups and it wasn't a front-line machine anyway, but I still 
would rather get the old disk running than dig out the archives because 
my backups are not up to the minute.

So I had another old machine that worked and I removed its drives and 
stuck this other machine's drive in its place and tried to boot it. What 
I got was basically no drive info found. It couldn't find VolGroup01 and 
then it couldn't find other system files it was looking for and it froze 
at switchroot failed to mount...
The setup menu can see the disk though. Could it be a conflict in what 
was in CMOS memory, or something like that? Does one not "just swap 
drives" on linux machines like that?


So I replaced the orignial drives, booted, and everything came up roses. 
I changed the initial runlevel to 1 for some reason I've forgotten now 
and tried to reboot. Now I got the exact same thing as with the other 
machine's drive. It can't find anything and stops at switchroot 
failed... These disks were running FC9.

What's the logical procedure for diagnosing this sort of thing?  
(besides scrapping the machines?) Do I now have two dead machines and 
three wiped disks? I did some Googling, but I didn't know exactly what I 
was looking for so that wasn't very productive. If someone could point 
me in the right direction, or can tell me what to do, I'd appreciate it.

TIA,
- Bill Thoen

Don't try to boot, use a live-CD or something, and then *mount* the
drives from the dead system (read-only, if possible).  Then copy
whatever you need (possibly everything) onto another machine or disk
or whatever you think is best for you.  Keep the old disks intact to
preserve your options, at least until you are absolutely certain you
have everything you need off of them.
