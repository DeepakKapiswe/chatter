Subject: [PLUG] Neat idea on blocking sites...
Message-ID: <40BC585F.1070803@robinson-west.com>

The following URL describes it, or at least it did tonight...

http://www.planetmars.co.za/forums/index.php?s=769e240650eb5cad9b8dbadfe19f06da&showtopic=13195&st=0&#entry159345

It says to put:

     127.0.0.1    badsitename

in /etc/hosts.


It's not a dns solution.


I want to be able to block access to certain sites using
something other than iptables rules.  Using iptables rules,
I get an ip list that goes stale very rapidly.  With enough
entries, it takes a long time to resolve all of the  hostnames
that I list.


I want to be able to say only these sites, or, alternatively, any
site but these.  I've read about tuns and taps, ipsec, PPTP,
and ssl tunnels.  I wonder if a tun can be used in site name
filtering as well as encryption?  I want to filter the URL a
user types into their web browser.  I don't want to force
anyone to configure proxy settings or in general use a proxy.  
Some sites break when accessed through a proxy.


If I extract the destination ip out of an http TCP connection
request, I figure a user space program can resolve it and check
a list.  Maybe a bad site list should be in the local DNS
to avoid resolving blocked site names.  I don't know if I can
figure out what URL is being requested via a tun.


In dns can I simply do:

127.0.0.1    A    badsitename1
      .
      .
      .
127.0.0.1   A    badsitenamen ?

Or is there a better way to do the latter?


An ip address can be typed into a web browser.
An example of this is:     

http://192.168.1.112

         or

         192.168.1.112.

Any ip address does not have to be looked up in
order for the browser to connect.  Is there a simple
clean fix for this problem?
 

Another content filtering method is to use a database
of blocked sites on the web and install special software,
or activate special browser settings.  This seems like a
silly approach since only Windows solutions googling
around have shown up so far.  The potential advantage
of using a third party database is that someone else will
know of a site you would block before you run into it.

This has become a problem since I re-built my home network and added a 
printer sharing box.  When I print from Mozilla I see only the Default 
System Printer (or some such -- I'm sitting are work right now.)  I find 
nothing in the near-line documentation on adding more printers to Mozilla.

Any pointers as I start a search at the Mozilla site?

Geez I did it again.  Wasted bandwidth before trying a simple search.

Xprint is the tool/trick.  Now to get it going at home.

Folks:

If no one else pops up, I would like to initiate a discussion
on open source replacements for the Microsoft Exchange infrastructure
that many companies use as a shield against full embrace of linux
in the corporate enterprise.

I am working on a project to try to find the best solution for
an 'Exchange/Outlook' type of infrastructure. I have come up with
Opengroupware and Kolab. I think it might be nice to have a discussion
on this topic.

Rod,

  When I press ctrl-p in mozilla and select 'printer' as the destination, I
see a dialog box with a 'properties' widget to the right of the widget with
'PostScript/default' as the printer name. In the 'properties' dialog box I
can change the printer command string from the default (lpr -P laser5_ps) to
use the color printer (lpr -P color). Most of the time the default is what
we want.

Sounds like fun.  We had to deal with that at the OSDL.  Luckily, senior
management was willing to move beyond their comfort zone. 
Otherwise, things would've been, erm, suboptimal.

Their report on the process:
http://osdl.org/projects/cmptblclndrng/results/
Note the requirements.  It was surprising what features needed to be
fully supported, such as delegation and busy/free.

That still strikes me as the "oh just go recompile the kernel" answer,
though. Should users need to know about modifying command line
parameters to change their printer? And what about CUPS environments
where lpr isn't used at all?

(Just playing devil's advocate, sort of.)

  Yes.

  CUPS is what we've run here the past few years. It will use either 'lpr'
or 'lp' as the command.

Mark,

    This sounds great to me.  One of the problems we had 
marketing the Netule EM-I (Email Server) was that we didn't
worry enough about MS Exchange.  It turned out that potential
customers wanted Exchange features that we hadn't thought to
be all that important, and they were very difficult to get.

    In any case, this discussion sounds great to me.
We will plan on it.  I will send out an announcement later
today.

P.S.  Let me know if you need anything like a projector.
Since this is an informal  discussion, I'm assuming you do 
not need anything unless you tell me otherwise.

Shotguns are legal for "police" uses, which would include MP/SP and I
don't know but shipboard use is probably legal under the Geneva
convention.

Although I don't use KDE, I use the kprinter utility instead of lpr.

My guess is that having a dedicated MC to moderate would be a Good
Thing.

Just to confirm.. this is at 6 tonight in Owen, right?

What an MC?  Evolution seems like a good Outlook Express candidate except
for the fact that it has crashed a lot when I've attempted to use it.

You're mixing up your email lists/meetings.  MWVLUG meets tonight at 6:30
in Owen 101 on the OSU campus in Corvallis, and the topic is
designing/building custom computers.  The PLUG meeting discussing MS
replacements is on Thursday in Portland at PSU.

Oh yeah, OpenOffice.org, works fine.  It was a breeze to set up.  So 
simple I don't even remember the steps I took.  I think I did it via the 
gnome printer setup and there it was in OOo.

You'll see in a later message I found the answer.  Xprint.  I got it
installed and I believe configured (I do love ssh) and will be testing it
this evening when I get home.

This covers group scheduling, but what about those that use Exchange to
share a Contact List, is there any hope for them?

Dear All:

I just upgraded to 2.6.6 kernel after upgraded to Fedora RC2.
I just tried to burn a CD.  It was working fine before and I did not remove 
or add
any hardware.
Not only does cdrecord -scanbus looks different (the scsi/tar/lun ID is 
different),
but cdrecord spits out an error message.

Anyone has any clue why I am getting an error?  -scanbus as well as
actual cd burning output is below.  Thanks for any tip.

Make sure you are not using ide-scsi emulation.  I suggest you try using 
k3b as a front end.  It does a good job of determining the environment and 
"doing the right thing".

ide-scsi is no longer supported in the 2.6.x kernels.  (At least not so 
that it would be usable.)

Seems like this should be a simple thing...

How can I make connections to the IP address of my box go to one dir and
connections using a domain name go to a different dir?

I think you should just have to setup two virtual hosts, one for the
IP and one for the Domain and point each to a different directory.

So like in my conf I have virtual host for <machinename>.<domainname>
as the default for the IP - and a virtual host setup for all the other
domains I host on it.

This box has multiple IP addresses...  I've got the ServerName parameter
set to one IP address.  Then I have the NameVirtualHost parameter using
the same IP address.  Then I created VirtualHost entries for the IP
address specified in ServerName and well as entries for the other IP
addresses.  Connections to the other IP addresses and domain names work as
they should, but connections to the IP address in the ServerName parameter
seem to ignore the VirtualHost entry and instead use the first VirtualHost
entry in the httpd.conf instead.  So I fixed it by moving the VirtualHost
entries around so the first is a default dir.
Strange.

Sounds like "url rewrite" may help you.

Replaced the UPS.  The machine was running this morning and hadn't 
rebooted during the early morning hours.  The APC Smart-UPS came with 
a CDROM with software, which I thought might be the usual WinXX only 
stuff, but no.  There's a Linux version on there, which I will try.

Thanks all....

Matt,

You fixed it correctly.  You have to place the listing of VirturalName
Host in order of the one with the IP you want to default to when the
Domain name is not given.  Thus you need all these settings for two
IPs or more.

IP 1 : 10.0.0.1  (Allow it to answer request)
IP 2 : 10.0.0.3

Listen 10.0.0.1:80
Listen 10.0.0.3:80

NameVirtualHost 10.0.0.1:80 (allow for a Virtual Host)
NameVirtualHost 10.0.0.3:80

<VirtualHost 10.0.0.1:80>
ServerName domain-one.com
ServerAlias www.domain-one.com
DocumentRoot /usr/domain-one.com
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 10.0.0.1:80>
ServerName domain-two.com
ServerAlias www.domain-two.com
DocumentRoot /usr/domain-two.com
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 10.0.0.3:80>
ServerName domain-three.com
ServerAlias www.domain-three.com
DocumentRoot /usr/domain-three.com
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 10.0.0.3:80>
ServerName domain-four.com
ServerAlias www.domain-four.com
DocumentRoot /usr/domain-four.com
</VirtualHost>

What this will do is that if Apache doesn't find an address to the
first request for the domain in the VirutalHost and it is not
mentioned in the ServerName then it will resolve the IP and use the
first hit.  This will mean that 10.0.0.1:80 will go to domain-one.com
and 10.0.0.3:80 will go to domain-three.com.

I have this setup on an Apache 2.x system and works great when I want
to go to my IP.  Or need too.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux router with aliased IPs
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0406021536030.8953@neon.netpro.to>

I have a Linux router with two interfaces (running Arno's IPTables
script).  The external interface has 3 IP addresses assigned to it,
using the devices eth0, eth0:0, and eth0:1.

When I make outgoing connections I end up using the IP assigned to eth0:0.
Any ideas why it wouldn't use the IP for eth0?  Is there a way to change
this behavior?

I don't see anything referencing the eth0:0 IP address when I list the
iptables rules and there's nothing I could find under /proc.

I'd like to force all outgoing connections to always use a particular IP
address.
Thanks,
~M

Not sure if this will solve it but you should be able to set an
iptables line as:

/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s $LOCALNET -d \! $LOCALNET -j
SNAT --to-source $ME

LOCALNET = 10.0.0.0/24
ME = External IP you want to mask from.

Then all computers in the 24 block of 10.0.0.0 will NAT to the correct
IP.  Or should.  Then again I could be all wrong.  It works for me but
I have only one external IP on that box that I NAT but I do specify
the IP.

Message-ID: <BAY9-F40kOFYZTyPvXb000672d5@hotmail.com>

Hello:

Sorry if this appears to be a stupid question...

I put in Fedora rc2 on several boxes last week
and one of the boxes has an Nvidia Quattro card that
seems to run into that 4k stack problem.  So I cannot fire up X.

I got hold of an SuSE 9.1 demo CD over the weekend and
I just sticked it into the very same Quattro box today.  It is demo only but 
it has a KDE environment and
X is firing up just fine.  It is running kernel 2.6.4.

So is the 4k stack problem appears only in post-2.6.4 kernel?
I think Fedora RC2 ships with 2.6.5.

Unfortunately that didn't work...  I wonder if there's a conflict with
MASQ rule from Arno's iptables script...  (ip changed below to protect the
guilty)

iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING
Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
TCPMSS     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere           tcp flags:SYN,RST/SYN TCPMSS clamp to PMTU
MASQUERADE  all  --  192.168.1.0/24      !192.168.1.0/24
SNAT       all  --  192.168.1.0/24      !192.168.1.0/24  to:1.2.3.4

I almost think that Linux randomly chooses an interface if you have
aliased interfaces and then it uses that IP from that point on...  because
when I first set things up I remember moving the IP addresses around so
the right one was being used for the outgoing IP.  But after a reboot, it
appears that it's changed.
Thanks,

Hmmm...  I included your rule as a custom rule for Arno's script to read
and now it works.  Apparently providing it on the command line after
starting Arno's script didn't work.  The order of the rules in the output
is now different:

SNAT       all  --  192.168.1.0/24      !192.168.1.0/24 to:1.2.3.4
MASQUERADE  all  --  192.168.1.0/24      !192.168.1.0/24

Thanks for your help, Josh.

AFAIK, Apache assumes if the request is aimed at the IP address Apache thinks 
is "the" IP address, it considers it as directed at no domains at all, so it 
feeds it the first VirtualHost, which is your default VirtualHost.

Actually, it shouldn't feed it to ANY virtual hosts.  The default host
settings should be the ones outside any VirtualHost directive.

I have a nvidia card, I tried the 2.6.6 kernel without luck.

I had to use the 2.6.5, this worked well.

I don't think there was a 4k stack problem with 2.6.4, I think it was
introduced in the 2.6.6

What I need is a rule that allows machines inside the firewall to go to 
the website with the FQDN instead of the private inside ip?

It worked with floppyfw but i made a better one and it does not work now.

I have tried some that other firewall scripts use but none work in mine. 
  If you want I can let you see my rules.

Thanks

I might be missing something here, but I'll take a stab at it.

Looks like the device file isn't there. If you're using devfs (or maybe
udev), that means your driver isn't loaded. Do you have all the right
modules loaded?

If you're just using regular device files, then run your MAKEDEV script
(if you have it) and make sure /dev/sg* appears. On my Debian system,
it's /dev/MAKEDEV, which is a symlink to /sbin/MAKEDEV.

The 4k stack comes from a custom patch to the Fedora 2.6.5-1.358 kernel. 
  It was included in the stock 2.6.6 kernel as a config option.  It 
supposed to be possible to rebuild the kernel from the patched 
kernel-source package without that config option.

Gah.  Not you Rob.  Michael, go to gentoo.org.  Look for the sound 
configuration guide.  It might be desktop.

Most of your problems it seems, you keep skipping steps.  Once you've 
played around with it enough, you can then skip by some of these.

If this doesn't make much sense, I'm on some lovely pain meds right now.

The 2.6.* kernel doesn't need SCSI emulation to burn CD's using ATAPI
devices.  All you need to do is specify the device by name, instead of
by SCSI numbers.

It looks like you have your burner as slave on the secondary IDE bus, so
try:

cdrecord -scanbus -dev=/dev/hdd

and:

cdrecord -v -eject speed=32 dev=/dev/hdd LiveCD-9.1-01.iso

Good Luck,

Well I've made some progress.  I now have in Mozilla both my network 
printers and a couple of converters -- ps and pdf.

Took installing Xprint (rpmbuild --rebuild xprint...src.rpm) and tarballs 
are available plue a deb package.

Rebuilding Mozilla with xprint enabled -- Redhat/Fedora disable it by 
default.

Finally tweaking the /etc/init.d/xprint that comes with the xprint package 
to be compatible with chkconfig.


Now I'm hunting/building the definition files for my printers.  The format 
used by xprint is not PPD.

Thanks to all that responded for the ideas to solve the problem.

Wow, great article. 

Warning: It's long

http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/0422/040602_news_microsoft.php

In the last two paragraphs the author talks about passion (and the
lack thereof for MS products). This strikes home with me recently on
my Debian laptop. Gnome 2.6 is on its way into the Debian unstable and
the other day after an update, I was excited to see an animated
cursor. I was happy to see that the arrow just got a little orb molded
into it with dots circling in it. I like the feedback and am glad it
doesn't interrupt the pointing end of the cursor, nor does it display
a detached pulsating icon like KDE used to. My first reaction to the
KDE animation (and this is two years ago or so) was to try and shake
that thing off my cursor. It's those little incremental improvements
rather than a Advertising firm media blitz of social engineering to
make you buy something new.

It's all about passion, about being part of a community, sharing in
successes. Sometimes when I relate a cool tool to a Windows guru
friend of mine, he replies "Just like Windows". He just doesn't get
that community side of it. It's like watching your pro team win a
championship versus you being in a recreational league and being on
the winning team.

Also the closed source nVIDIA driver has the problem with 4k stacks.  The 
Open Source driver does not.

I took option "2" and it seems to have worked, and was less expensive than
I initially thought it would be.  The only bad part of this solution is it
effectively locks me in to 1GB total system memory, since my chances of
finding a 1G module that would "match" my 2 512MB modules are pretty slim.

Also, to answer Rob's questions that got lost in the shuffle:

> DOES reducing the memory bus frequency solve the problem?

Yes.  This works flawlessly, but I didn't get the 400MHz chipset and
400MHz CPU just to run at 333MHz.  ;-)

> DOES slowing down the timings solve the problem?

No, in fact this seems to make things worse-- however I suspect that the
magic I-know-what-I'm-doing override to enable them in my BIOS also turned
on something else that broke it.  I didn't follow up to find out exactly
what this may have been since I wanted everything to work at full speed.

Google about and you'll find explanations for why they cannot do this.

Legally, they'd find themselves fighting a lot of lawsuites, I fear, if they 
opened their driver code up.

They *are* a business out to make money, after all.

I am just wondering why he has to rebuild it every reboot.

I have found the nVIDIA drivers to work pretty well.  They also support 
cards that are not just their top of the line models.  (Like ATI.  BTW, 
don't get an ATI Radeon 7000.)

It is in x.org or xfree86.  It is called "nv".  (Instead of "nvidia".)

Juast have to change your config file for X.

The issue as it was explained on the LKML a while back, is this:

In our Patent-happy world, it is virtually impossible to create any computer 
hardware that doesn't step on some patent somebody has somewhere, especially 
if you're designing something as complex as a graphics card.  It simply isn't 
feasible to make sure your hardware violates no patents out there already.

If they released the source code to their drivers, everybody would begin 
inspecting it for evidence of violations.  Regardless of whether or not there 
are any violations, they're going to be sued.  As the only people to win in a 
lawsuite are the lawyers and consultants, that would cause nVidia to lose 
money even if they won the suites.  Guess who will foot that bill?

We, the consumers, will foot that bill.

So, look at it from nVidia's point of view.  Right now, they aren't losing a 
significant number of customers because of their closed-source driver model.  
What happens if they open their drivers?  They get sued.  They have to raise 
prices.  They lose more customers than they gain.  How does this make good 
business sense?

I don't like using the closed-source stuff, but I've had to do so with
other folks' machines quite a few times over the last month or so and it's
not such a pain, really.

For the record, I use the Debian source package and do
make-kpkg modules_image

Work like bear-bone charm.

Just in case anyone didn't already know the USPTO has granted some
ridiculous patents:

Subject: [PLUG] PHP OOP Programming question
Message-ID: <060420040347.3159.40BFF0E000081E3400000C5722007358349B029A08020E03040709@comcast.net>

I'd consider myself an above-average PHP programmer (waits for the laughter to die down) but I haven't done a lot of OOP programming. I've done some basic stuff- making classes, methods and properties, and used them with some success. What I'm trying to say, is I'm familiar with the basics of OOP Programming in PHP. 

However, I'm working on a fairly large project, and I think it'd be great to use classes for it. In contemplating the "structure" of these classes, I have a question.

If I make a db_access class, with you know, queries, return values, connections to the db server, etc.
And I make a "tasks" class with deadlines, tasks, id numbers, etc, what is the approved way to have tasks use the database. Should make a base class that includes the db stuff, and then extend it for various other classes, should I instance that db class when I instance the other classes 

i mean this:
class Foo(){
  var bar;
  function Foo(){
   $this->bar = new db_class;
 }
}

These ways seem fairly weighty to swing around when I instance code, and it seems like I'd have a lot of extra connections to the database.

Any suggestions/best practivces?

Why not, nethack plays just fine with the nv driver. :-)

Don't expect suspend-to-RAM to work [1] if you use the binary nvidia
driver either, or an odd resolution like 1280x800 (though I didn't poke
very hard at getting the latter to work when I discovered the former
wouldn't).

[1] To be pedantic, suspending to RAM works fine with the binary nvidia
    driver. However, if you actually want to resume from your suspended
    state...

I would imagine that he only reboots after changing his kernel, which
will keep the nVidia module from loading.  The 2.6 kernel seems to be
doing a better job of this, you don't have to recompile the nVidia
modules if you don't change the kernel version, but you do change your
kernel.

I haven't looked at ATi cards for quite some time... but when last I did, 
their drivers worked similarly to nVidia's... a chunk of binary-only and a 
chunk of code to make that binary stuff work.

Are their drivers fully opensource now?

Have you looked at PEAR? It's designed to be "a framework and distribution
system for reusable PHP components." More to the point, it has a
standardized database interface. Theoretically, you could code an
application to use one DMBS and later switch to another without a lot of
effort. I say "theoretically", because I have not done it yet myself. :)

This is good advice.  I have two things to add:

1) There is no "approved" way of using "safe" scripting environments
   like PHP (and it's ilk).  Those tools were created for (and are
   best for) relatively small jobs where you're trying to optimize 
   between so-so programmers, high throughput, and rapid development.

   So, this implies that the real answer is:  do whatever works.

2) If you're stuck in a position where you have to use a lightweight
   tool like PHP to do heavy lifting, then, by _any_ means necessary,
   jump on some bandwagon with a community of developers and use a
   set of tools that can be debugged, used, and criticized by as
   large a number of people as possible.

   E.g. the only reason perl [cough] even _works_ is because there are
   so many people _involved_ in it.

And I'll throw in a piece of opinionated trash, too: If you want to
learn OOP, start with smalltalk ... or, maybe, Sather or Self.  Don't
pollute your thinking with garbage like Java, C++, PHP, Perl6, etc.
If, however, those obscure languages are not interesting and you
aren't inclined towards purity, pick something reasonable like Python.

All I know, is that the video cards I have used over the years, have all
been supported by X, no kernel modules have been needed.  But of course
I'm not a l337 gamer.  I do not believe that patents are the real reason
that Nvida refuses to provide the information needed for drivers to be
written, unless they really are violating somebodies valid patent.  I
think they a just paranoid and afraid that is anybody actually saw their
design they would laugh.  I see it all the time companies are so
convinced that they have some magic jewel of a technique that gives them
a leg up on everybody else, and they are almost always wrong.  In every
case, it would be easier to implement the functionality from scratch,
based on public knowledge, that it would be to aquire the magic jewels.

Who is working to convince companies that there's an advantage to producing
publicly designed hardware?  What research has been done on this approach to
demonstrate that a given company won't go bankrupt or fail to produce a
superior product?  It's fun to poke at companies that keep secrets, but do
companies have any other option?  Proprietary hardware wouldn't be such
a big problem if there was proprietary hardware designed to work with Linux
and X.

Message-ID: <40C0DA22.8050300@robinson-west.com>

I compiled apache 1.3.20 with mod_ssl where I'm wondering why it 
requires having a certificate before the
compilation takes place?  I copied one from another server, I just 
cheated.  Can I just produce a valid certificate
now or do I have to start from scratch and produce the valid certificate 
first?  Do I have to remove all apache
files every six months or so?  My instructions are for an awfully old 
version of apache by today's standards.
I don't know how far I can upgrade without using a newer Linux release 
than Redhat 7.3, but getting behind
is not good for security.  I don't like any of the newer Redhat releases 
much.  Fedora doesn't appear to be
getting very good reviews.  I'm starting to explore gentoo, but I've got 
a ways to go with it.

I don't have autoindex support enabled.  Is this why all these *html.en 
files from the apache documentation
had to be copied without the .en extension manually to get them working? 
 I certainly want to have the
documentation working.

I took Alan's advice (Thanks Alan) and got a copy of the latest X server

Subject: [PLUG] Slackware-9.1 network connection problem
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0406041420410.28568@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I know there are some other Slackers here so perhaps I can get some
distribution-specific guidance for a problem I've not before encountered.

  Since the last clinic -- the one devoted to WiFi -- I've not been able to
get eth0 working. It used to be there when the system booted. Now the
"network is unreachable" and both 'netstat -rn' and 'route' show loopback
but no eth0. /etc/hosts is fine (I had to rebuild it after re-running
'netconfig'). The static IP address, netmask and default gateway are all in
/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf under eth0. I checked the cable for fully-seated
plugs on both ends; they are. I even moved the cable from one port on a
switch to another port on a different switch.

  While out of town earlier this week, I plugged into the dsl port in the
motel, ran 'dhcpcd -d eth0' and got an IP address right away. When I checked
/etc/resolv.conf today it was not overwritten by the dhcp server.

  Once, this morning, by running 'ifconfig eth0 down' followed by 'ifconfig
eth0 up', I established the connection (but without a default gateway line
in the kernel routing table) long enough to scp a file from the portable.

  After the clinic, EmperorLinux found part of the WiFi problem in
/etc/hotplug/firmware.agent. That's the only file deliberately changed.

  I'm really puzzld by this. Haven't see this in any box since I set up my
linux network 7 years ago. So right now I have no network connection --
wired or wireless -- from the notebook. Not nice.

  Ideas appreciated.

Thanks,

Rich

Good point, and salient too- but I think my use of "fairly large" is slightly different from your use. It's more of a "ten tables large" as opposed to the "three tables large" I generally work with. I think it's still ok to use PHP in it.  Thank you for your insight, and the fascinating link though (I bookmarked it).

That's a good piece of advice, since I'm planning to use Smarty anyhow, and the server has some of the base classes of PEAR available. Ok then, how do I make 

class Foo {

  function getFoo($id) {
     $db->execute({sql});
      ...
    }
}

That is, how do I reference other classes from within a class? Surely, I don't make Foo extend DB?

I know we're not being helpful for this thread's purposes, though I
see plenty of help going on elsewhere, so I'm not too concerned; but I
must chip in and agree whole-heartedly. I would also add that PHP has
the strongest history of encouraging security loopholes in code. I
wish I had the time to go find it, but I do remember reading a good
article on common pitfalls in PHP code to avoid -- I wish someone here
would post an URL to it.

I'd recommend investigating Zope or Mason, myself. But it sounds like
that may just be adding too much work from the original poster's
perspective. Caveat builder.

I think it's hard to make money on a product if the design is public in the 
same sense OSS software is public.  There would likely be a lot of 
innovation, I think, but the only thing a company could do would be 
manufacturing the hardware...

It might be neat, but I think it would be a mess.

There was some discussion on the LKML a while back about what it would take to 
get a group of hardware and software engineers together to design a video 
card for Linux that would do as good a job as ATi and nVidia do... it was 
deduced they likely *could* do it, but one of the lower end cards would cost 
upwards of 3-4 times the cost of the current ATi and nVidia cards (which are, 
BTW, not very inexpensive).

That would be an excellent argument; except it is a problem for ATi.
There is an open source driver for ATi's cards, however, as with the open
source nVidia driver, the open source ATi driver is *strictly* 2D, none
of the 3D capabilities. If you want to make use of the 3D capabilities,
you must go for a binary-only module.

No commentary on whether the patents are valid (non-obvious and
non-trivial).

They provide enough information for a 2D driver (well not exactly, they
wrote the 2D driver and have no problem with that being open source).
Just nVidia does not provide information on utilizing the 3D capabilites,
but then again no one else does either. If open source is the critical
factor for you, the driver is "nv"; no problems with 4K stacks, no evil
closed source; but you sacrifice the (software 3D works, but is hideously
slow in comparison with hardware).

Looking at the companies involved, it does seem likely they've got those
magic jewels. They're large enough to hire very smart people, and create
very fast and efficient hardware and software.

If you're using a static IP, Slackware essentially just runs ifconfig and 
route for you...

Can you manually run the appropriate ifconfig and route commands and see what 
happens?  Something like:

# ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.15 netmask 255.255.255.0
# route add default gw 192.168.1.1

...then test your connectivity.

What does the output from ifconfig and route -n look like?  On ifconfig look 
for bytes tx and rx, the IP address, and the netmask.  Under route -n, look 
at the default gateway (0.0.0.0) and what interface it is assigned to.  If 
you're playing with your wireless connection, check iwconfig for an access 
point and signal strength.

Works, but it is a bit of a kludge.

I believe there is an executable under the StarOffice

can run to configure printers for star office docs to use.
Don't  know if that will help.

Rob,

  Yes. And it was doing just fine until a couple of weeks ago.

  Nope.

  The 'ifconfig ...' works just fine. But, as soon as I press [Enter] for
the 'route add default gw ...' I see: SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable.

  ifconfig shows both eth0 and lo up. But, eth0 has receive packet errors
and does not display an IP address. 'route' shows only localhost (lo).
'route -n', after running ifconfig with the explicit eth0 address, shows the
Destination of 192.168.55.0, but the gateway is 0.0.0.0.

  The WiFi card is not in. I want to get the wired connectivity working
again -- consistently and upon booting -- before more attempts at the WiFi
access are made. Wait a moment ...

  I just remembered that Kurt suggested that I turn off the WAP. When I do,
ifconfig shows the proper IP address. Still can't ping ... but I'm rebooting
the notebook. Rats! No difference. That is, the network still doesn't come
up on the notebook. But, I suspect now that this has something to do with
the switches. Perhaps I cannot daisy-chain two regular LinkSys 4-port
switches and a LinkSys WAP. Anyone have an 8-port switch I can borrow to
test this theory?

Thanks,

Rich

Sorry, closed source means people's computers often don't work and they 
don't know
why.  You can't prevent someone else from growing an apple for example, 
but this does
not mean that having an orchard is nonprofitable.  The problem is 
clearly patent law,
noone should be able to sue someone else for using a common idea.  I 
also feel that
the outsourcing of valuable jobs by companies importing or exporting 
goods needs
to be limited.  We should not let any company this country does business 
with outsource

Yeah, could you imagine manufacturing something that isn't patented and
expecting to turn a profit?  Like, say you wanted to make dining tables or
sewing needles or clipboards or something and you didn't have a patent
that gave you exclusive control over the technology, what would you do?
You couldn't possibly stay in business making things without a state
monopoly.

There wouldn't be innovation because there wouldn't be a profit to justify
the R&D.  You either would have to keep your research results a secret
(and, therefore, not open source your drivers to hide your precious
secrets) or publish your research results and have the wealthiest folks in
your sphere of manufacture (or extremely wealthy people outside of your
industry) beat you in the marketplace.

(The answer, of course, is to remove the means by which wealth is
accumulated and thus redefine "the marketplace".)

No doubt.  Welcome to the death throes of market capitalism (which might
actually be the greatest victory of market capitalism and the death throes
of civilization).

We don't have market capitalism Jeme.  There's no market, just a few 
really powerful
companies that want to do business elsewhere and pay foreign employees 
nothing.  
With  true capitalism there's competition.  The computer hardware 
industry isn't
a competitive one.  This is suggested by the idea that only a few very 
smart people
can build 3D video cards.  In a competitive sector, there would be more 
than just
a few really smart people.  I hope we're not in the not so smart crowd, 
guess we'll
have to ask Rob about that.  Either we have to be smart or make do with poor
Linux support for today's fanciest video hardware.  I don't see an 
alternative
where this thread doesn't appear to be on track to finding one.

If you need the output (but AFAICT, there never is any from iptables),
you can do this:

$command = '/sbin/iptables ....' .
' .... ' .
' .... ';

$output = `$command`;

If you don't need the output, this is probably preferable:

system('/sbin/iptables ... ' .
' .... ' .
' .... ');

This really boils down to how to quote multiline strings. When using the
string in system() or backticks, the newlines are interpreted as command
separators, so you have to get rid of them:

$command = '/sbin/iptables ...
...
...';

$command =~ s/\n/ /g;

You can also write it like this (which doesn't appear to work with
backticks):

$command = '/sbin/iptables ... \
... \
...';

I hope one of these works for you.

True, true. The ATi and nVidia cards are much more readily available
though. Brian was sounding like he strictly wanted 2D so I was addressing
that.

Interesting find. I'm left wondering how complete the drivers are. It
/looks/ like those only doing the final rendering to the framebuffer. I
also note the partial R300 driver includes closed source microcode. The
modern cards can do vertex transformation in hardware, I'm unsure whether
that is supported. Certainly that is well understood and not encumbered
by patents, however all the interesting features of modern cards are
affected.

That is because ATI can't code a stable driver (on purpose) for windows, let
alone any other o/s.

  When a network consists of both wired and wireless switches, does it
matter to the proper functioning of both in what order they are used? In
other words, does it matter if the connection from the firewall/router to a switch
goes to the wired switch or the wireless switch?

  On the same broad topic, I just bought an 8-port switch and will re-wire
the network this weekend. I'll have two LinkSys 5-port switches for sale and
a bunch of cat5 cable (including 2 100-foot rolls -- one blue, the other
yellow) all at very reasonable prices.

Can't you export it as Postscript (a.k.a. 'print to file') or PDF? You could

Depends on the wireless switches - If they are just a switch, then it 
would not matter - but if the are providing NAT or DHCP (wireless 
router) then it does. Realistically though you really should put the 
wireless switch of a seperate leg of the firewall.

My neigbor was really pissed at me when I showed him how easy it was for 
me it use (and abuse) his wireless network.  Now he has an old p75 as a 
firewall and a lot more security.

  Well, I have two NICs in the floppyfw box so I suppose I could put in a
third one. The WAP I have (sorry for the inaccuracy, Wil) is rather dumb:
four ethernet ports and one marked for the Internet. I'll connect the uplink
port from the new 8-port switch to one WiFi port and see how everything
works when I'm done re-wiring. Probably some time next week as this weekend
is fully committed.

Sure, you can test by telnetting to the pop server at its port
(default 110): issue the initial telnet command, as below, and when
it replies type in the "USER" and "PASS" and "LIST" commands like
in the below example; if working it will let you login and display
any msgs. on the server.

you at client$ telnet server 110

You should be able to telnet to it on the appropriate port and see
that's it's working.

Sean,

  Despite that being winduhs-oriented it reminded me of what to do.

it in future announcements.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0406071224570.2937@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

My system has been working great, until ....

I have been playing around with usb thumbdrives, usb cammeras, music CDs, 
and I have been removing and adding hard drives.

This shouldn't be a problem, except SuSE 9.0 trys to automate things
(a bit like Microsoft does) and this can lead to problems.
At the moment, my /var/log/messages file is getting lots of 
messages like:

    Jun  7 12:09:13 sco302 kernel: Device not ready.  Make sure there is a  disc in the drive.
    Jun  7 12:09:44 sco302 last message repeated 12 times

    Jun  7 12:21:45 sco302 last message repeated 24 times
    Jun  7 12:22:13 sco302 last message repeated 11 times

Unfortunately, nothing seems to give me a straight forward
indication of what drive is causing the problem.

Anyone have a quick idea of what might be wrong?

Not sure if the USB devices show up with the mount or (my simple favorite)
df command.  If they - your devices - are using the USB/IDE/SCSI tricky 
stuff they should be.
   And of course you have as a last resort the three finger dance to rid
yourself of the messages so you can try again and see where it all went
wrong.  I seem to remember there is a setting (somewhere) to turn off the
MS-ish stuff ofUSB and IDE CD-R(W) drives.

Oh yeah,  There is the /proc file system but since I'm stuck at work 
dealing with a WinXP machine I can't check on the particulars there or the 
mount/df commands.

If you get memory on E-Bay where the seller says it's good, or that it's 
so much, and a number of the
modules turn out to be bad, is it best to complain to them directly via 
email or is posting
negative feedback called for?

A lot of these items are so cheap.  The shipping is so high that sending 
them back isn't really a good
option.  How can they know to refund you if there's no way for the goods 
to be inspected by them,
because it's too costly to send them back?

With E-Bay's feedback system, it looks like someone could easily post 
feedback for the wrong item.
Due to the fact that feedback is irretractible, a negative statement is 
awfully strong.  Thanks to the
buyer apparently risking a lower score from negative feedback, It seems 
that fraud is encouraged
because complaints cost the buyer points.  

I've been trying to add memory to my Linux servers.  Looking for 30 pin 
4 meg simms and 168
pin PC100/133 256 meg DIMM's, it's hard to find these locally at a good 
price.  If I wasn't being
shipped goods from New York, etc., I could return them.  With $6-$12 
shipping fees, I don't
want to do that with  low cost items.

Subject: [PLUG] Mail access from laptop on the LAN
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0406071605320.23482@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I've made a discovery with the inability of my fiancee to access mail from
her laptop by turning on 'telnet' at the server. When the MUA tries to
connect to 'mail.appl-ecosys.com', the connection is attempted to the
external IP address. And, I have port 110 shut on the firewall.

  Is there a way to configure a MUA to look on a local host? I've tried
telling it to use just the host name and the non-world-readable, class C IP
address but without success. Or, is there a user-transparent way to ssh in
to the network and access mail that way?

  I realize now why there's no problem from the networked workstation: that
has /var/spool/mail nfs-exported and mounted. D'oh! So, unless told
otherwise, I believe I've identified the problem. However, I've no idea how
to solve this one. FWIW, I don't have this problem on my notebook because
when I'm away from the office I ssh into the network then read mail on the
server, not locally on the portable.

TIA,

Rich

I try to resolve it first via email with the seller.  I had three bad
experiences, one the seller had made a mistake and replaced the item.  The
other two were bad faith so I gave them negative after trying to resolve
it with no luck.

I think I have a bag (probably ~50 sticks) of 30 pin ram somewhere. If you
want it, I'll look for it.

Contact the bidder, at least give them a chance to redeem themselves. You
can always post negative feedback and let ebay know that the items were
broken, etc, if the seller is an ass. (Probably get your money back too)
You have a limited amount of time to file a fraud claim.

I suppose running memtest86 would be a good idea, just to have some evidence
that the ram is bad. I'm assuming it is being detected, etc. There were too
many damn problems with ram compatibility years ago (fuck dell).

USPS ships priority in their 1 rate envelope for $3.50 nationwide, you can
fit a _lot_ of stuff in one of those envelopes with a lot of padding. I've
managed to fit nics wrapped in 2 layers of the big bubble wrap into one of
them.

If you are running your own dns server, you could use bind's "views"
feature to have queries for mail.appl-ecosys.com that come from
internal lan hosts answered with the internal, private address for your
mail host.

You'll need to do some reading up on how to do it, but your named.conf
would go something like this:

view "internal" {
	match-clients { 192.168.1.0/24; };
	...other options...

	zone "appl-ecosys.com" {
		type master;
		file "/var/named/db.appl-ecosys.internal";
	};

view "external" {
	match-clients { any; };
	...other options...

	zone "appl-ecosys.com" {
		type master;
		file "/var/named/db.appl-ecosys.external";

  Thanks, Stafford. So far I run a cache but haven't finished installing

I think you should at least give the seller the chance to make the situation right. I don't think that buyers will not leave negative feedback when it is due, for fear of retaliatory negative feedback from the seller. Sure it happens, but when I am reviewing feedback for a person and I see a negative, I will drill down and look at the feedback of the person who left the negative feedback, to determine if it was retaliatory or not. I have had several bad experiences, where I have left negative feedback and the seller has not retaliated with negative feedback. I have also had several potentially bad experiences, where I have contacted the seller and they have corrected the situation and ultimately received positive feedback for following through and not blowing me off after getting paid.

  Progress to report:

  Using sylpheed (rather than mozilla mail), I set the SMTP server address

Why is bind less secure? It's been sometime since I've seen bind run as 
root on any Linux system I've setup to use it. If bind is being run as 
root I'd agree with you about security but newer distributions  of Linux 
I've setup run "named" with a userid of "named" not "root".

Even if local root is not compromised, if your name server is
compromised, your identity can be hijacked. Just think if paypal.com
is diverted to some site that sniffs your password information and
then snags all your money.

BIND's track record is miserable. tinydns's track record is perfect
(and backed by a money guarantee).

Tony,

  It's what I've read from folks much more informed than am I.

  Please remember that linux is about choices: most options are different
but not necessarily better or worse. I like emacs (and joe), you like vi. I
like pine, you like mutt. I like Slackware, you like Debian. So what? Do we
care? Not I. As long as it does the job, is easy to install, configure and
maintain the choice doesn't matter to me.

  I'm glad that folks are happy with bind, sendmail or whatever. I'm happy
with tinydns, postfix and the otherever. :-) If you want to discuss values
and beliefs I'm sure there are plenty of Usenet newsgroups available. And,
let's not forget talk radio on the AM band.

  Whoa! Halt! Cease! Desist! And cut it out, guys. My question has to do
with getting my fiancee's mail to her laptop when connected to the local
LAN. Let's not head off down a side path into oblivion of the original
question.

  To restate: using sylpheed she can send mail when the SMTP server is
specified as 192.168.55.1. But, with the pop3 server specified as the same
IP address the connection is closed by the remote host. That's running
qpopper-4.05, by the way.

Thanks,

Have you checked Fry's for these items? I picked up some PC100 128 MB's
for a few bucks on clearance. You could always try "Kingston value ram"

 As far as disputes leaving bad feedback can lead to a nasty war,

Seconded. I also would be surprised if tinydns didn't offer something
similar to bind's views option.

Another option, and this may have been mentioned already, would be to
modify your firewall rules to allow pop connections from your internal
lan to your external interface address.

Depending on what the order of operations is, i.e. nat first then check
rules, or check rules then nat, you might need something like "allow tcp
source_ip $external_nat_address destination_ip $external_nat_address
port pop3".

It says part number 811708 on the back as well as C/S: A

For Radio type it says: PC-24E-H-FC

This pcmcia wireless card says it is Linux compliant.  I don't know
if it's 802.11b compliant, but I thought it was an Orinoco card.

My brother is playing with the second one, he says he's had
no luck with it.  It apparently locks up with the Orinoco driver.
The driver you're supposedly supposed to use is wvlan.c.
Is wvlan.c getting phased out?

The web site for the manufacturer is http://www.alvarion.com.

I picked it up from a company in California selling lots of two
on E-Bay out of a bulk order.

My brother says he saw a kernel panic and shutting down interrupts
error when he tried to fire the other card up.  He's using 2.4.23
kernel and he think he's running the recent Slackware.  If he can't
get it working, I'll loan him my SMC card that does work.

Maybe the card he's trying to get going is just bad.  Do Type II cards
work in Cardbus pc card slots?

Is the client or the server displaying this message?  The log file on
the server should give you a lot more information, unless the qpopper
daemon isn't running at all.

You really should try to telnet from the laptop to the pop3 port on the
server.  This is a very good reality check.  I have set up several LAN's
where the pop3 server (qpopper) is accessed by ip address rather than
host name and they have always worked (still are as a matter of fact).

Good Luck,

  I believe that it is, but I will certainly check ...

  Hmmm-m. I guess not. I cannot find a 'popper' in the process list. What is
the daemon name?

  I turned telnet on on the server and that's when I discovered that if I
set the MUA to seek mail on mail.appl-ecosys.com it attempts to get in the
firewall because the name is resolved to our world-visible IP address rather
than the internal LAN IP address. 'salmo' or 'mail' resolve to the
192.168.55.1 address, but not if the domain is specified, too.

  I'll check further for the qpopper daemon upon return to the office. (Off
to the gym now.)

Derek,

  I've looked, but I cannot find a running qpopper daemon.

  We can take this off the list if that's preferred, but perhaps others
could benefit as I learn, too.

  I have /usr/local/sbin/popper, but invoking that does not produce an entry
in the process list. And, despite my reading the pdf guide that came with
the source, I don't know how I want to configure it. IOW, I need some help
here. :-)

  In qpopper-4.0.5/samples/ I have two files: qpopper.config and
qpopper.xinetd. The former begins with:

# This file lists all Qpopper configuration file options.  To use,
# copy the desired setting to your own configuration file, remove
# the leading '#' and set the desired value.

Do I copy this to /etc/qpopper.config? I'm not sure what values to put in
most of these variables.

  I'm not running xinetd on the server. But, it looks like it invokes the
service for pop3 on port 110. I suppose this file needs to be copied
somewhere and invoked in /etc/rc.d/rc3.d or ../../init.d?

  All in all, I suppose that once I learn how to configure and fire up
popper I should see better results when trying to connect from that laptop,
eh?

TIA,

Rich

  Allow me to correct this: I've gone at least part of the way through the
GUIDE.pdf's configuration section. I assume that I want stand-alone mode
rather than Internet mode; if so, do I enable entries in either or both of
/etc/inetd.conf and /etc/services?

  I did put in both files the recommended lines (which may conflict with
each other, but I'm not clear on this) then ran kill -HUP <inetdpid>. So I
assumed the daemon was running. Apparently he's not even walking.

  That's as far as I got before. I'll trudge on.

Got a live one on the phone on Friday. Her name is Barbara and she
is from a market research group that has been contracted by Intel
looking for Fortran and C++ on Linux programmers.

Here's the deal. Intel will give you $100 (if you meet the above
requirements) to try out their new compilers for a couple of hours and
give them feedback on what you like and don't like. This is NOT a coding
gig, but rather market research targeting programmers.

If this describes you, please contact Barbara at MDC Research @
503-977-6719 between 7-4:30. Good luck.

Peace,

/etc/services is just an association table (names to numbers), like
/etc/hosts.  If there is a pop3 entry in /etc/inetd.conf then you
won't see a running daemon in your process list unless someone is
actively connected to the pop server.  The inetd "superserver" daemon
will launch the program speicifed by /etc/inetd.conf for you when
someone tries to connect to that port.

  Thanks, Russell. That clarifies things for me. However, I also rebuilt
qpopper with the --enable-standalone switch during the ./configure step.
According to the administrator's guide that should have the daemon running
all the time. I suspect that I need to do something with the .config and
.xinetd files, but I have no clue what.

Well, if you are going to run qpopper in daemon mode, you want to turn
it off in the inetd.conf.

Why do you want to run it in daemon mode again?

  OK.

  Again, according to my understanding of the administrator's guide, that is
appropriate for access within the local network. There will be no one
accessing the service externally. OTOH, if it doesn't make any difference
then I don't care how it's running -- as long as I can get it working, that
is. :-)

Running it in daemon mode is really only important in high-performance
situations, like when you have a tens or more users.

Daemon mode is better if you are trying to debug the server program
because you have more control over how it starts, can attach a
debugger to the process, etc.  But otherwise, in your situation it
doesn't make that much difference which you use.

Did Comcast muck with the local broadband Internet connections recently?

I'm asking because today I'm unable to make a VPN connection I've been
making everyday for the last year.

Nothing has changed on either end, so I'm suspecting Comcast mucking
around with ports, etc...

What is the ip and the port? I can try pinging you from
outside Comcast and see if I can get through.

If it's an IPSEC vpn, than the problem could be passing IPSEC-ESP or
IPSEC-AH traffic, which are neither TCP, UDP, nor ICMP, but rather their
own protocols.

I think it was the first Google hit on "comcast" and "vpn" that brought
me here:

Which suggests that, mmmmm, just maybe, they mucked it up to strongarm
folks into buying their Comcast at Home Pro product.

What would happen if you were to tunnel IPSEC-ESP and IPSEC-AH over
something else (HTTP, SSH, DNS, whateve) to bypass any filters
that Comcast has in place? If you tunnel it through ssh, you should
be able to prevent them from seeing whatever you are doing.

I can tell you that I was at my mother's house last night and this morning before work trying to install a linksys router for her. Her connection became fubarred over the weekend, and comcast technical support convinced her she needed a new router. 

It's not just the router, the cable modem lights were randomly flashing too. I've done this before, and never had this sort of problems- it's pretty much not rocket science. My own comcast connection went belly up on Friday but came back on Saturday morning.

Subject: [PLUG] Converting old laptop to portable monitor and keyboard
Message-ID: <1086751902.23231.10.camel@timmy>

I have a very old machine here (Thinkpad 760L, type 9547, model U0A)
that I would like to attempt to convert to a portable monitor and
keyboard I can plug into my headless servers. I'm looking to be able to
futz with the BIOS and the bootloader, so a software solution won't
work.

Is this even remotely possible? I don't care if it's extremely
difficult, just as long as it's possible. This is just a project, so I'm
not interested in things I could buy.

To test that the screen and keyboard are working correctly, I want to
get into the BIOS of the laptop itself. What's the key combination for
that?

Thanks!

Evan

I found it out - hold down F1 while booting. And it works!

The yenta driver needs to be removed and pcmcia card services version three
needs to be installed.  The orinoco_cs driver should be used instead of

Message-ID: <40C65A06.3040406@robinson-west.com>

I'm looking into why I'm getting IO errors with my scsi drives.  
Thinking it's a bad cable, I now wonder if I need a newer card
that is more recent on the LVD/se standards?  The drives are Compaq 
MODEL MA3043LP.  The label says Wide Ultra 2 scsi. 
Looking this up on google, I'm a bit surprised to run into the 29160 
adaptec controller.  It supposedly operates at 160,
twice the 2940U2W's 80 speed.  What happens if I plug a drive meant for 
ultra 2 wide 160 into an ultra 2 wide 80
controller?  Does the drive merely run slower?  These 68 pin LVD cables, 
what the difference between an Ultra 320
one versus an Ultra 160 one, etc.?  can I buy a cable for a newer scsi 
card that's 68 pin and use it on an older one?

It drops the same drive every time, probably a bad cable.  I wonder if a 
250 watt power supply for an onstream SC50 and four
of these compaq drives is too small?  I'm trying to get a new five 
position cable.  I'm almost tempted to get a box of 10 new
three position cables cheap and add a second scsi card.  Would I be 
better off with a different scsi card manufacturer?

I have tried swapping in my spare drive.  Unless the spare and the drive 
I swapped out are both faulty, I'm at a loss.
Why would it work for a while and then err out with an ext3 fs io 
error?   My coco had a  problem with a bad disk drive
cable which caused  behavior  similar to what I'm  running into.  Is 
there some site I can get a Linux friendly adaptec
2940u2w bios from, just in case it's a firmware issue?

/Is there something like memtest86 to test the scsi card itself?  I

Does the scsi cable have a TERMINATOR on it?
Depending on your configuration, an SE/LVD terminator may be necessary.
Most SE/LVD terminators out nowadays run up to U320 speeds.

The problem is if you include an SE device into the bus. Then the whole bus 
has to drop out of hyperspace (LVD mode) and play in 80-ohm single end mode.

Consider it like a Hi-IQ club party or a high shop-talk party, and along comes 
Gomer and Harriette. It's impolite not to include them in conversation, but 
now no one's talking about Sekigahara, Degas, Dali, Bohr, Hofstader, what's 
in /bin,  Bronowski, etc - everyone has to drop down to talking about sports, 
the weather, and how the kids are doing.

Dave, have you checked the /etc/fstab file? It may have been that when
you mounted a USB device (or one of those other objects) that somehow
SuSE decided to help you by adding an entry to the fstab. (I know that
adding a SCSI device requires using the mount command.)

If that's clean, look to see what has changed lately in the /etc directory.
On my antique RH box, Linux keeps track of what gets mounted where in the
/etc/mtab file -- which I determined by running ``ls -lt /etc".

And if someone else hasn't offered the right answer by the time you
read this, I guess the solution is hiding somewhere in the man page
for mount -- or a related command.

All,

The City of Albany is considering the procurement of new finance and

I note that the OSS community spoke with Portland in 2001 regarding a
similar procurement:

These drives new? Do the drive labels say "LVD" or differential?

If not most likely those are non-differential 40MB/s drives.

They all use LVD, and the same cables. The difference is simply how fast
they can transfer data. Devices on the bus that can't handle the higher
speeds will force the bus to operate at slower speeds, but otherwise
_that_ won't cause any problems.

What will cause problems is that it sounds like you've got
non-differential drives, and a differential controller. This won't work,
10/20MB/s and first generation 40MB/s SCSI were non-differential, but
later 40MB/s and all 80MB/s drives and controllers operate strictly with
differential signalling. Unfortunatly both 40MB/s non-differential and
the differential hardware use 68-pin cables. If this is the case you
don't need a more recent controller, but an older one (actually I've got
such a controller, but I don't have the right drives; sorry on
motherboard, so I can't hand it off).

Technically, Ultra 2 is LVD. It is *sometimes* still misapplied in
marketing labels, though.

If it is a 29160 SCSI host adapter then there are three buses and I
believe you can use upto two of them at once.  On my 29160 I have LVD 160 
and LVD 320 hard drives on the LVD HP68-pin bus (?) and a tape and CD-R on 
the 50-pin SCSI/Wide SCSI bus.  The hard drives run at 160 tops and the 
tape and CD-R at 5 and 10.
   This is the reason I bought a 29160 (based on a recommendation from 
this list :-).

2-series only have one bus, iirc; but Adaptec is able to do a nifty
twin-tailed transceiver thing so you can have non-differential and
differential devices hanging off of each tail. Yes, recommended. :-)

That is a bit far for daily commute to/from Portland. If it were

regularly.

Of course, there is a substitute here in Portland; Common Ground

Which reminds me of some of my favorite verse:

  [...]

  But there was one a shy young man, and although he was Finnish
    The joys of winter had for him long started to diminish
  He was a Finn, the only Finn, who would not take a sauna
    "It isn't that I can't", he said, "I simply do not wauna."

  And so he stayed close by the stove for nine months of the year
    Because he was so sensitive to change of temperature
  His friends said, "Come on Torvalds, let's go out to Sunfish Lake.
    Why a Finn who don't take saunas, why there must be some mistake!"

  But Torvalds said, "There's no mistake, I know that I would freeze,
    in water colder than myself: 98.6 degrees.
  To jump into a frozen lake is not my fondest wish,
    For just because I am a Finn, don't mean that I'm a fish!" 

  [...]

For the unmutated version, see, e.g.:

Cool, P-90 with 8MB standard and a 640x480 color display.
I was just thinking of making a Compaq Aero 4/25 run Linux.

It is remotely possible.  And I mean *remotely*.  After figuring out the
protocol, you'd need to program a microcontroller to read the keyboard
and spit out PS/2 keycodes, then build another, high-powered
microcontroller with several hundred KB of RAM (framebuffer) and three
high-speed A/D converters to digitize the analog VGA signal and convert
it to the appropriate commands for the display.

This is, in fact, a FAQ that has been around since laptops were new.
I'd have said to STFW, but it was fun coming up with a serious answer.

Hold down F1 while turning the machine on.

Message-ID: <BAY9-F8RBGLiHtRleY60001d1a3@hotmail.com>

Hi All:

Have a CD burning question.
I am running 2.6.5 kernel.  I am able to use K3B to burn data CD.
But I just tried burning a VCD  using K3B and it failed.  The message
was something like K3B cannot burn CD with multiple tracks...

Any recommendation on how I can burn VCD?  cdrecord does not seem
to work anymore.

Thanks

Subject: [PLUG] Apache access control question
Message-ID: <20040610065038.EB36B8F00@tinman.seitzassoc.com>

I'm confused about access control under Apache (2.0).  What determines the
default access control?  For example, if I have an entry in httpd.conf
like the following, what sets the access control for /var/www/icons?

Alias /icons/ "/var/www/icons/"

<Directory "/var/www/icons">
    Options Indexes MultiViews
    AllowOverride None
</Directory>


Ultimately what I would like to do is allow access to all of my web stuff
from 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.1.0/24 via http, and allow access to
selected directories from anywhere via https with basic auth.  I've
seen examples of this, but they would be easier to follow if I understood
how access control picks up its defaults, as well as whether there
is any scoping or inheritance of permissions.  Note that I'm not
planning to use htaccess files.

thanks,
galen

That's great.  I've had more than one beer with him (two different

although very quiet (until the third beer :).  His kids are really
cool too.

I've also, (ahem) *danced* for him. <http://use.perl.org/~merlyn/journal/8591>

You have no auth or access control directives here, so /var/www/icons
will inherit the directives from higher-level directories. If you don't
have any such directives in your httpd.conf at all, then AFAIK the
defaults are to allow access from anywhere.

This document is probably what you want:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/howto/auth.html

Off the top of my head, something like this would do what you want:

<VirtualHost *:80>
 DocumentRoot /var/www/docroot
 
 <Location />
  Order deny,allow
  Deny from all
  Allow from 127.0.0.1 192.168.1.0/24 
  # You can replace this stuff with iptables rules like these:
  # iptables -I INPUT -s 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT
  # iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -s ! 192.168.1.0/24 -j DROP
  # This will be more secure.
 </Location>

</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443> # for https
 DocumentRoot /var/www/public

 # Set up aliases here for other directories
 
 <Location />
  # Put AuthType and Require directives here
 </Location>

</VirtualHost>

Hope this works (I'm accustomed to Apache 1.3).

I'm rebuilding a lightning-fried Linux server and installing Red

Slapper worm was a threat to the earlier versions of Apache (I

Does anyone know if Apache ver 1.3.23-11 is immune to this

Subject: [PLUG] DHCP, DNS and Hostname
Message-ID: <BAY9-F54HIRGOq7HNnV000cc490@hotmail.com>

Hello:

I am having some problems with DHCP and hostname and DNS...
Appreciate if someone can offer some tips...

One of my boxes at work is running Linux and I am obtaining my IP from DHCP.
It is my understanding that DHCP will also assign my box a hostname
based what sysadmin set in the DNS record to associate with the given IP
to a hostname.
Last week, I upgraded to Fedora RC2 and for some odd
reasons, my hostname is gone and I am given a generic one.
Since then, I have had emails with the sysadmin abotu this problem.
He claims that hostname is set in our company's DNS by picking
up from what I set in my own box.  So effectively, I can pick whatever
name I like and it will be my hostname and it will populate with the DNS 
record.
I found that puzzling but did it anyway.  And of course, nothing happen.
I am still the generic hostname even though I have changed
it everywhere (/etc/sysconfig/network ; /etc/hosts)

I am still unable to resolve my original hostname.  I keep telling the
sysadmin that I think the name is dropped from the central DNS record
somehow...

My question is, does DHCP really picks up hostname from client boxes
when it assigns leases and set that in the company-wide DNS server?

  Has anyone printed color images in an OO.o doc?

  I had a new logo designed for my company and have copies saved as *.png. I
threw together a name tag for meetings with this logo, my name and a tag
line. Then I printed it on my H-P Professional Series 2500C inkjet printer.
The color of the logo has too little blue. I don't know where or how to
match the printer color to the display color.

  The logo colors are dark green and royal blue. It prints as light green
and lighter green.

TIA,

I think this is what you are looking for:

There is an entry in the dhcpd.conf file:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
get-lease-hostname

    Directs dhcpd to provide a hostname to each client that is assigned a
dynamic address. Further, the hostname is to be obtained from DNS. This
parameter is a Boolean. If it is set to false, which is the default, the
client receives an address but no hostname. Looking up the hostname for
every possible dynamic address adds substantial time to the startup. Set
this to "false". Only set this to true if the server handles a very small
number of dynamic addresses.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should be able to set this boolean to true, along with setting
up DNS with pre-assigned host names for each DHCP issued IP address.

Something like these entries in the dns files might work:

$GENERATE 50-254 dhcp-$.devel A 192.168.4.$
(in the forward dns file)

and

$GENERATE 50-254 $ PTR dhcp-$.devel.fglan.
(in the reverse dns file)


I hope this helps

Thanks for your help.  I'm fairly certain now that I was getting fooled
by browser caching.  Now I'm using links for a browser, and restarting it
each time I restart httpd.  Access control changes now seem to make sense.

Mark:

Thanks for your reply.  If I understand your correctly, what you have 
provided
are for setting in the server level -- i.e. the actual DHCP server that 
passes
out the leases.  My box is a client and I have no control
over the server other than through the sysadmin.  He is claiming
that I can set my box to whatever name and the server will pick it
up and assign that name to the my given IP and update
the DNS record to reflect so.

The funny thing is I cannot even resolve my old name anymore
which leads me to think that the name is dropped entirely in the
company-wide network.

Another solution to that problem is to temporarily set your Mozilla

I think that some of the newer versions of dhcp and dns allows for dynamic
updating of DNS.

This has to be properly set up by those who have access to your DHCP and
DNS servers.

This required entries in the dhcpd.conf file on the dhcp server as
well as the zone file on the DNS server. Here is a very rough outline
for what you (or your admin) needs to do:

Get version 3 of the dhcp server if it is not allready installed.

do a:
dnssec-keygen -a HMAC-MD5 -b 128 -n USER DHCP_UPDATER
get a public/private key pair

Then put something like this in the dhcpd configuration file:

key DHCP_UPDATER {
  algorithm hmac-md5;
  secret pRP5FapFoJ95JEL06sv4PQ==;
};

zone allyn.com. {
  primary ns.allyn.com;
  key DHCP_UPDATER;
}

zone 17.127.10.in-addr.arpa. {
  primary ns.allyn.com;
  key DHCP_UPDATER;
}


Then put something like this in your dns (bind) config or zone files

key DHCP_UPDATER {
  algorithm hmac-md5;
  secret pRP5FapFoJ95JEL06sv4PQ==;
};

zone "allyn.com" {
	type master;
	file "allyn.com.db";
	allow-update { key DHCP_UPDATER; };
};

zone "17.10.10.in-addr.arpa" {
	type master;
	file "10.10.17.db";
	allow-update { key DHCP_UPDATER; };
};


Finally, you must ensure that the client (the pc) is configured to ask
that the dynamic DNS to use its name. That part I don't know how to do,
but it would be best to go to the OS's vendor's web site.

Evan,

  This printer does that automatically. A couple of weeks ago I replaced the
black, cyan and magenta cartridges because the black was expired and the
printer wouldn't work. Since the other two were coming up to their
expiration dates I replaced them early. Yellow is good until next year.
(This is the only thing I dislike about the H-P inkjet: consumables are very
expensive, about $120 for four ink cartridges and the same for the separate
print heads. Yuck!)

  The print heads (which are separate) don't expire, they just wear out.

  I should have mentioned in my original post that the colors are fine when
the image is printed from The GIMP. Haven't tried any other software.

Vincent,

  Have you any color mis-matches on the printed version compared with the
monitor version?

I did notice that PDF files come out with better color quality.

IBM T series.  I've used Debian woody on both a T21 and my current T41 without
major issue.  The T41 was quite less than $2500, and that is with the higher res
screen (1400x1050), 512RAM and Centrino 802.11b card (uses net available kernel
module ipw2100).

In file /etc/sysconfig/network put a line like this:

   DHCP_HOSTNAME=myhostname

This name will be reported to the DHCP server when you
get your IP address.

Older versions of Red Hat sent the HOSTNAME value but this
caused some problems. So this separate variable was created
so that you could control your DHCP host name separately
from your regular name.

You can also set DHCP_HOSTNAME in your each of your
interface files /etc/sysconfig/networks-scripts/ifcfg-*.
That way you can have a different DHCP host name for
each interface.

I'll second that suggestion. I use a T22 and it's run Red Hat 9, 
Fedora Core 1, and Fedora Core 2 without incident.

That said, I'd love to have a laptop with a built-in wireless card. 
External PCMCIA cards have started to annoy me.

That seems high, not medium.  What's this for?

I wanted something I could game with, so I got a Dell 5100 (spent around
$1100 on EBay for a brand new machine), but you may be more comfortable

I can't speak from memory about the precise version, but if you're using
the latest security update, you're fine.   And actually it's mod_ssl
that you need to be concerned about, not Apache.

Would a Mac Powerbook fit the bill?  It's bsd under the hood, and if you
can sacrifice a bit of speed, Virtual PC will let you run XP in a window,
if you don't have odd hardware requirements (usb seems to work okay).

Built in usb, firewire, .11g, 15" screen, 80gb/512MB, dvd burning, 1.5Ghz
G4 for about $2,500.  If you want something smaller, the 12" seems really
small and light to me, even compared to the 15" version.

Well, I may be looking for a new laptop as well.  Mine was dead when I

Message-ID: <40C8D18D.90208@mphpress.com>

I took a lot of flak lst time I was on this list, but I decided to come 
back for two reasons.

1. I'm going to be studying Lonux and bulding Linux "Freekboxes" for 
Free Geek, and

2. I miss the prople who were nice to me.

I am not currently using Linux on my own system -- my Red Hat crashed 
disastrously on my and only with a Windows installation could I save my 
data. That odesn;t mean I wouldn;t go back to Linux if an opportunity 
presented itself to do so. basically, though, my main interest, at least 
for a while, is going to be learning Linux, learning to build Linux 
boxes, and evertually building Linux boxes for other people. So first I 
need to learn my sutff, and then I need to put it into practice.

One of the things I am trying to figure out is whether there is a makret 
for an indpendent PC contrustion contractor in thie day and age, and 
whetehr I have what it takes to fill that need once I complte my 60 
hours or so of Free Geek training, practice and experience. Entering the 
Builkd program is very exciting, but I'm woindering if  it's only my 
first step.

So here I am. Again. You may call me whatever you like now.

P.S. i also run an eBook publishing house called Michael Hopcroft Press,

This won't come up right away, but I thought I'd ask the question anyway.

Which CD or DVD recordable drives (or indeed DVD player drives) have 
Linux drivers? If I'm going to be building custom computers for people 
and they want to both use Linux and burn CDs or play DVDs, I need to 
know which drives can I buy (or ask my customers to by).

As far as I know, Linux has drivers for all of 'em-- IDE, SCSI, FireWire
or USB.  Incompatibility is, like, soooo last century, man.  :)

Any modern drive should be supported.  The PioneerDVD burners work well, 
as do the Lite-on drives.

As for playing movies, you will want to get the dvd decoding libraries 
from freshrpms.net, ohterwise you cannot read most DVDs.  (Due to "copy 
protection".)

That's one reason I followed up my post with one wondering whether there 
was a central source for both compatibility and drivers. When i was 
using linux on my home computer, i effectively had no printer because 
there was no linux driver at the time for the Lexmark Z65 inkjet.

I don't want anything like that to happen to any of my customers once 
I'm in "the business".

There used to be on SuSE's web site. I don't know if it is there anymore.

Avoid SiS chipsets on motherboards.  (Especially for AGP.) Everything else 
seems to work (That I know of.)

ATI video card are OK as long as you get an Radeon 8500 or better.  nVIDIA 
has drivers for most/all of its product line, but ATI does not.  (As I 
found buying an ATI Radeon 7000.  There are free drivers, but they do not 
do hardware acceleration wit the motherboard I have.)  If you just need 2d 
video, go with Matrox.  They have very fast video cards for 2d 
performance.

All the sound cards i have tried have worked, with the exception of a 
cmedia card.  That one is now supported by Fedora code 2.

Printers it is best to look at the gimp-print site and check what is 
supported.  Avoid anything that is a "windows printer".  (Goes the same 
for "winmodems".)

Hard drives are not an issue.  The only issue is size and the mherboard.  
Anything new should support LBA48.  (Larger than about 120 gigs.) SCSI 
drives are uncommon.  I have only seen one problem with scsi and that was 
actually a problem with a specific controller.  (Intel 440glx 
motherboard.)

The best thing to do is research what your customers need and narrow 
things down to boards that will meet those requirements.  The harder part 
is going to be finding motherboards that will not break within the first 
six months.

I don't know if I'll be installing Red Hat for my customers. Will those 
still work? IT looking like I need to buy a good book at some point, or 
borrow one. from a friend, that will teach me the baiscs of things like 
finsing hardware and software drivers for the various flavors of Linux?

P.S. I juist signed up for Exhibit Hall access to the Open Source 
Conference, although I hsve yet to receive the confrimation. what will I 
find in the Exhibit Hall, and how much will it help me?

P.P.S. What is the best way for someone who does not have a Linux 
machine to obtain multiple copies of the proper Linux distributionfor 
distribution to customers of a computer-building business?" Is it 
possible to download the install files of a Linux distribution without 
interfering with an existing OS?

P.P.P.S.: Whatever happened to a package called "Linux for Windows" that 
supposedlyt enabled native Windows users to use the Linux OS as a second 
OS on their system? I have an 80GB hard drive partition going unsused. 
Maybe I should try my hand at dusal-booting if I can find a way to make 
it work....

Its called an ISO file. A disk image. You burn it to a CD.

Seriously, not to flame you or anything... but please don't try installing linux 
for other people.

To answer a previous question of yours:
The best way, IMHO, to learn linux is to install something like gentoo (or even 
better, linux from scratch). You will have a fairly deep understanding of how it 
all works after you do that. The installer dumps you to a command prompt, the 
directions explain exactly what you need to do, and what you are actually doing.
This also will enable you to understand more about "what driver you need" as well.

Trying to help...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0406101535030.1605-100000@gisnet.com>

Can someone tell me the name of the RH 7.3 RPM that contains a pop3 
server? I just set up a new server, but pop3 wasn't included in the 
install and some old notes I have refer to imap-4.5-4.i386.rpm, but there 
is no rpm beginning with "imap" on my distribution disks. I did have it on 
my old 7.2 system (which got fried 2 days ago.)

I checked a site called www.rpmfind.org, but didn't see any RH 7.3 rpm's.

Subject: [PLUG] rc startup script question
Message-ID: <BAY9-F258HqS5C74a2400026337@hotmail.com>

Hello:

I am running Fedora RC2 2.6.6 kernel.
It was my understanding (from other Unix flavors)
that when I want to add new stuff to be started at boot time,
I put in a script in /etc/init.d and then symlink
from /etc/rc<level>.d/

I just did, and symlink from /etc/rc3.d, /etc/rc2.d and /etc/rc4.d
And then to verify, I typed

    /etc/rc 3

and my stuff did get started.
So just did a reboot but none of my stuff was started...

Did I miss a step?  Why is it that I ran /etc/rc and the stuff was started
but not when I power reboot the box?

thanks

--Vincent

That's one of the things I'll be learning to do, at least on newly-built 
(or rebuilt in this case) systems, at Free Geek. And once I have the 
skills I plan to put them to good use.

Bill,

  Go to the Qualcomm Web site and grab a copy of qpopper-4.0.5 as a pop3
server. It's better than the default that came with RH 7.3. pop3 is good
when you (and any other users who get mail through your server) use a local
access and want to remove messages from the server after they've been read.

  IMAP is better for users who want to read messages from either local or
remote logins and on different hosts. The messages remain on the server so
they're available from a different host at a different time.

Perhaps because techies don;t buy quite as many HDTV Bog=Screeen TVs as

I think Fry's kjnow what they're doing in terms of selling their stuff.

Just to clarify, they want you to do this on-site in Hillsboro. and 
the only available days (apparently) are 6/15-6/17.

Sorry if this was already made clear.

That makes it damn near impossible for me, since it's 1.5 hour drive
one-way from where I work to Jones Farm.  And it knocks the payoff
down to something like $20/hour, which would only be worth it on a
weekend or at night.

But for those of you near there, it does sound fun.  I'd love to be
videotaped learning a new piece of software.  (as long as I got to see
the tape! 8*)

Thanks Rich... And I *did* find it on the RH disks just now.
There are RedHat/RPMS directories on both disk 1 & 2.  It was on
disk 2. The imap*.rpm contains servers for pop3 too. So now my
mail server works happily with my netscape mail client, and the
web server works and so does FTP. Now to recover the bits that
remain off my old system and transfer them. But that's tomorrow's
job.

I need to figure out where I can get a copy of that. theoeertically I 
could download it, but downloading the entire directory simultaneously, 
and then burninn it to a CD, soiunds like there would be some enormous 
hassles involved.

Not that it would probably be a long download -- I have a pretty darned 
fast connection -- but it would be a beast to mange with my software.

what i want is to install Linux on an unused partition on my hard drive.

  Barbara called me back with news that I qualified, but the days were the
16th-18th. As I have an IMST[1] meeting in Corvallis on the latter two days
and need to prep (i.e., read all the stuff that'll be on the agenda) on the
16th I couldn't participate. Oh, well.

I don't run Fedora, so I can't give you a direct answer. Check out
/etc/inittab to see what runlevel you're in and what init scripts it
runs when it boots. man inittab for more info.

No, an ISO; like I said before, is a disk image. You're right, downloading 
directories would be a major hassle.
Grab one from here: http://unix.schluting.com/knoppix/

I'd recommend: http://unix.schluting.com/knoppix/KNOPPIX_V3.4-2004-05-04-EN.iso

Burn it to a CD (using nero, choose "burn image") then boot it. You don't have 
to install anything... once you're done using it, just remove it from your CD 
drive and boot windows again.

I have seen more than one case of stuff that had been returned to shelves 
being broken.  If they test at all, it is not a very good one.

never buy anything at Fry's that has been opened.  (Unless it is something 
that has no components to fry, like a screwdriver.)

Unfortunately, try as I might, I could not get the year-old 5100 I was
using to suspend to RAM with the 2.6 kernel. My boss has a new IBM T41
(might be a T40), and suspend to RAM works just peachy, as it does on
the Toshiba M35-S359 I'm typing this on (more drawbacks to this machine,
I don't recommend it, but it was available when we laid off a salesdroid).

If you can afford it, the IBM route seems to be the way to go.

On Red Hat/Fedora, you can save yourself the pain of manually managing
those symlinks with the 'chkconfig' command.  Are you booting into a
graphical login?  If so that's runlevel 5, which you didn't mention
making a link for.

  There's also 'chkconfig' on Red Hat-type systems. It will let you
designate what services to run during which run levels. Very handy tool.

Did you name them with a 'S'nn at the beginning?  Most SystemV 
configurations (which Redhat and friends are) require/use the capital S 
for start and capital K for killing the script.

This requires (?) some special entry's (sp) at the top of the file (look
at some of the other files in /etc/init.d).  There is a semi-GUI 
interface to chkconfig system called 'ntsysv'.  This will show you what 
startup scripts Fedora knows of.

And if this sounds knowledgeable don't be fooled.  :-) I'm shooting from
the hip on some of this.  It has been a long time since I got into this
deeply.

That doesn't even make any sense -- Sony's already received their
money from your retailer. It's the retailer that took it in the shorts
selling it to you, eh?

Here's how it actually works: Big company contracts out their tech
support to a company like Stream or Cyberrep. But they reward on the
basis of number of calls handled. So it is in Stream/Cyberrep's best
interest to handle as many calls as possible. So they train their
employees to meet a so-called "Average Handle Time" per call.[1] If you
miss your AHT, you're fired. Oddly, they still have a strong culture
of "you do a good job of helping people" (and humans want to do that
anyways) or you're fired.

It's *almost* worse than working at McDonald's for the poor people at
the bottom. Unfortunately, the environment drives some people to
develop "tricks" and "techniques" for ditching callers as fast as
possible. Most techs do try to be helpful, but the system actually
encourages them to abuse you.

[1] Actually, "train" is a strong word here. They don't actually give
their employees any skills to meet AHT -- they just throw the techs in
the deep end (often without even much of any practical training for
the product they're supposed to represent[2]) and assume the constant
flow of new bodies from turnover will keep the business running.

[2] It's not uncommon for a new hire to receive a week (or less) of
training. Even if they've never actually used computers before in
their life.

  I just learned that a Comcast subscriber in New Joisey cannot send e-mail

"Permanent failure: other address status".

  A Web check with google turned up others with this problem. Has anyone

  What a PITA. Apparently there's nothing I can do about it. Comcast seems

Alright, well, apparently the tech was full of bull umm... feathers. 
Spoke with a manager, confirmed that the tech was a 'tard. 
He barely spoke English, so I wasn't exactly surprised. 
Yeah, I know about the hole that is tech support. That said, Stream 
isn't that bad for most of their stuff. I worked there for a while 
and I spend 8 months out of one year in "training" 
That was cool - and the exception.

their employees any skills to meet AHT -- they just throw the techs in
the deep end (often without even much of any practical training for
the product they're supposed to represent[2]) and assume the constant
flow of new bodies from turnover will keep the business running.

[2] It's not uncommon for a new hire to receive a week (or less) of
training. Even if they've never actually used computers before in
their life.

I just did a telnet to port 25 of a non-comcast mail server
from my comcast account (using a putty window) and was able
to get out okey.

So, your problem is not that comcast is blocking port 25.

I don't have an imap or pop client so I don't know if imap or
pop are blocked but I doubt it.

If all else fails, you can try tunneling imap/pop/smtp over
ssh. Go to www.openssh.org for help.

  I did not mean to imply that comcast is blocking everyone. However, I find
references on google to others who have had the same problem.

  Whatever. Her mail to me doesn't make it out the door.

  On whose end? My domain's MTA is located here and it feeds directly to
procmail which puts the messages in /var/spool/mail/<username>. No pop or
imap involved. Also, they're not involved at the sending end. I believe that
even Microsoft's MUA sends directly to the smtp server.

  You've lost me. Is the sender -- on a winduhs box -- supposed to do this?
I can't do anything on my end to suck mail from another's outbox can I?

I think the misunderstanding here is that I get the impression this
person is just talking to a Comcast MTA and has nothing to do with
your network services or running their own MTA. Mark seems to think
the opposite.

If I understand correctly, then, no I don't know what you can do if
their MTA is failing intermittently. She should complain vehemently.

  Yup.

  Unfortunately, I thought I had clearly expressed that she was trying to
send e-mail and it was bouncing back to her.

  That's what I recommended. According to one URL I found, comcast denies
any responsibility: "Da Debil made me do it!". Sigh.

We use Red Hat Enterprise 3 at work on several servers and I have access 
to the Red Hat Network. I can download ISOs of any of the older RedHat 
6.x, 7.x, 8.0,. and 9 releases if I want. We have some software that we 
run on some systems that require us to use Red Hat 7.3. Yea it's old but 
it still does the job.

Yeah, but will his children attend public school?  Portland is exceptional
for its high level of public school enrollment by children of parents in
higher income brackets.  He might not consider it an option.

It does if they're trying to fight gray-market goods.  Sony sells the same
products for less in poorer countries than it does in wealtheir countries.
The price set is determined more by "what the market will bear" than by
the actual cost of production and distribution.  It's not uncommon to see
discount stores selling goods purchased in another nation and shipped to
the US for resale for a hefty profit that are still well below MSRP.  Sony
(and other multinationals) do whatever they can to discourage this
behavior (going so far as to sue resellers for trademark infringement, if
you can believe that).

Anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if they DID have such a policy, but
covered it up and helped Karol anyway because of the fuss being made.

Either of these could be the issue.

The Comcast folks have said publicly that they will start to block 
packets destined for port 25 on other machines if they think the 
machine in question is being used to send spam. Since Comcast's cable 
network is the source of huge amounts of spam, that's not a bad thing.

Also, some RBLs are pretty aggressive about labling Comcast networks 
as untrustworthy. As Rich himself told me one day, some of my messages 
had been marked as spam because they originate on a comcast.net 
network, even though I relay all outbound mail through 
smtp.comcast.net.

  Oh, my! Will someone please enlighten me how I mis-communicated so badly
that two respondents tell me it's _my_ comcast account that's the problem?

  My comprehension of the first paragraph above (the one I wrote to start
the original post) is that I am the intended recipient and it is the sender
who has the comcast account. If I can understand how this was
mis-communicated then I can be more careful in the future to write more
clearly.

Thanks,

Rich

Paul,

  As my average monthly volume of out-bound e-mail is 400-500 messages, I
would hope that even comcast would not consider that the volume of a problem
spammer.

  The problem does not originate at my end: the packets never make it this
far. Nothing is rejected by postfix, procmail or spamassassin. They are
blocked by a comcast MTA somewhere near the point of origin.

  I routinely receive messages from comcast subscribers (including you)
while I will see specific IP addresses from the comcast network blocked by
an RBL. My inability to receive messages from this one source does not fall
in this category.

  I'm still running it on two workstations because it just works. And, it
supports almost all the applications I use; the few it does not are used
only infrequently.

  Why is "so ancient" bad if the system is secured?

  I've replaced mozilla-1.6 with firefox-0.9 and I do like the latter
better. It is taking me a while to adjust to the reversed placement of "OK"
and "Cancel" buttons on dialog boxes, but change is good, right? Keeps the
user on his toes.

  Anyway, firefox does not include the ability to shut down the application
by pressing ctrl-q. I can use alt-f/q, but not the familiar ctrl-q. I wanted
to ask the developers to add that hotkey to the menu, but a long search of
the mozilla Web site revealed no place to provide feedback on firefox! Yes,
there is access to bugzilla, but I do not consider the lack of a feature a
bug. Does anyone know how I might be able to communicate with the folks
responsible for firefox to express my desire for the ability to use ctrl-q
to quit the application?

Because I'm using an ancient machine. Rather than throw it out because it
can't push the newest Windows stuff anymore, I thought it was pretty cool
that I could get years more life out of it as a Linux-based server.

Also, I've found that the latest versions of RedHat are optimized for the
latest versions of hardware, and if I try to load, say, RH 9 on a
mid-nineties pentium I, and don't know a whole lot yet about Linux, I seem
to have problems.

Maybe someday I'll learn enough here to build a customized Linux system 
with the latest packages for any machine I have, but in the meantime, I 
just have to work with what I know.

OK. So you've got a remote (Joisey :-) correspondent on a Comcast 
network. When she sends you messages, most of them get returned saying 
there's a problem with the remote address (or something like that; I 
deleted the original problem description).

A few possibilities come to mind, some more likely than others:

1. The Comcast admins in Joisey have screwed up their local network.

2. Your correspondent has got some spyware or adware on her machine
    that is sending spam, and Comcast is blocking mail from her host.

3. The Comcast mail server used by your correspondent doesn't like to
    deliver directly to 216.99.x.x; maybe that's been identified as a
    dialup line or something like that.

4. Your remote correspondent is hand-addressing some of the messages
    in question and is misspelling your e-mail address.

Since my mail seems to get through to you, my hunch is that the 
Comcast network is probably configured correctly -- though I don't 
know if there are internal variations. Comcast bought most of its 
subsidiary networks, and there could still be struggles to get it 
configured consistently.

I'd be interested to see the entire SMTP error message returned by her 
mail server.

This is in Debian unstable, too (not stable, dunno about testing).

apt-get install libwpd7

That package includes the stand-alone utilities.

1) Laptops are borrowed from factory service, not owned.  The laptop
may need service once a year.  Look for a company that does very rapid
repair, with no backtalk.  Good (formerly great):  IBM .  Very bad:
Dell.  HP/Compaq might be OK, very Linux conscious, no direct
experience.  No opinions beyond that.  Get the three year service
contract, subract that ($400?) from your starting price.

2) Internal/External Wifi:  built-in is supposedly convenient, but
it is very hard to specify chipset that way.  Atheros, Prism-2 good,
Cisco OK.  Everything else is poorly supported.  You get a lot more
options with a PCMCIA card - which can be moved around, sold, etc.

3) Dual boot:  Note recent issues with 2.6 Kernel and XP, described in
http://www.ces.clemson.edu/linux/fc2.html and elsewhere. 

4) If you travel a lot, or are otherwise more than a couple of hours
away from a charger, get a Valence N-Charge external battery for about
$300.

5) Extra chargers, or at least extra charger power cords, are a good
idea unless you like crawling around plugging and unplugging things.

You will find that, starting with a budget of $2500, you will be down
to $1500 by the time you pay for all the goodies that make laptop life
worth living.

With the possible exception of Dunthorpe.  The fact that a community the
size of Dunthorpe has not only it's own school, but an entire district
should say something.  It's actually a little ridiculous.  In the office
here we've got a map of "school district coverage"; Riverdale is a tiny
little blue dot in the corner of a vast field of pink.  Its size,
however, has no bearing on the quality of the schools.  By all measures
it's a good school staffed by good people ;-P

Oops, I did misunderstand. I had been working on a problem
where a user could not access their MTA via imap and it did
turn out to be their imap client was trying to access the
wrong port.

This is a matter that I did not do a complete wipedisk on my

As I understand it, the best way to talk to people at mozilla is to use the
forums.

I tried the firefox 0.9 release candidate for a couple of days.  
There are definately things to like about it, but I found enough
bugs to make me go back to galeon.  (And yes, I reported the bugs.)
After Monday, when the 'final' release comes out, I'll try it again.

  Ah, you cynic, Keith! :-)

  I will admit to continuing problems with my first portable: in 1992 I
bought a Gateway (made by TI) 486DX/25. Junk design. However, since then
I've had two Toshibas on which I installed linux (the Libretto L70 and the
Portege 3025CT) and had absolutely no problems with either. The Libretto I
sold rather quickly because the keyboard is too small for touch-typing. The
Portege is still here, with a new battery and Slackware-9.1. Slow by today's
standards, but a wonderful, light machine. (For sale, btw, if anyone's
interested).

  Nods in agreement. On Keith's recommendation I bought the 65Whr version at
Fry's on my way to Corvallis last month. We had to meet in a room on the OSU
campus where I did not have access to a wall outlet. Glad I had the extra
juice.

  For my Toshiba Portege I have two chargers. One stayed in the office and
the other was in my computer bag always available for travel. In my case it
was not a conscious decision. I was on the plane to Reno when I realized I
left the adapter in the office. So I ended up at a mobile computing
distributor down there (Go Direct?) where they allowed me to make a retail
purchase of an A/C adapter/charger as a walk-in.

  What about used? Is that a realistic option for someone? Just curious.

I would make sure that you are keeping up on the updated software and
backpatching.  7.3 is no longer officially supported and there are a lot
of holes in the legacy code.  (Especially in the kernel.)

I would also check for patches to uw-imap.  It has never been that
secure.

It is not, but then again I never hear you asking where to get it.  I

Ali,

  Thanks for the reminder. I tried that (using firefox, of course) and the
connection was rejected. I assumed they didn't want to hear from us
users. :-)

Thanks -- I'll try again.

I don't think anyone cares to check DUL's when they DELIVER mail, just
when the ACCEPT mail. At least, yet. :-)

Actually, if you're like me, your MTA is generating bounces for failed
spam deliveries of a much higher volume. I find that we're generating
400-500 messages a DAY, at least, just trying to be RFC-compliant in
the face of the tides of spam. It is soooooo tempting to turn off
bounces sometimes.

  I missed Paul's original post this morning. 216.99.0.0-216.99.31.255
belongs to SBI in Salt Lake City. 216.99.192.0-216.99.206.255 belongs to
Aracnet.

  Do dial-up lines have IP addresses? The interesting thing is that I did
get one message from the originator a few days ago. Of course, when there's
nothing in my mail log I don't know there's a problem. It is to avoid this
situation that I'll frequently put into an e-mail message the request,
"please let me know if you do not receive this so I can resend it." :-)

  Wouldn't surprise me, either. Perhaps they've outsourced the tasks.

Chris,

  Ah! You got me there; I forgot all about that.

  I am slowly modifying my postfix UCE rules to discard rather than reject.
When I discovered that I could route the junk to /dev/nul I started using
that option. I save the bandwidth of the rejection message and most of those
go to either spoofed addresses or to providers who don't seem to care.

  For the past several years I've been very dilligent about reporting spam
and doing my bit to keep the 'Net flowing. However, it's like pushing water
uphill and I know that my tiny contribution makes no difference in the
volume being transported. Ergo, discard rather than reject.

I generally don't bother bouncing spam; it usually just goes into a
quarantine and gets deleted, or it's rejected before delivery due to the
lack of a valid recipient.

Well, sure, neither do I, but I'm talking about 400-500 messages per
day that are on the threshold of "unclassifiable" -- I'm /dev/null'ing
at least twice that already.

Yes.  Essentially every system with Internet access has an IP address.

When you dial up, generally your ISP assigns you an IP address via DHCP.

Actually, with dial-up the IP address is negotiated as part of the PPP
handshake, not DHCP.

Rob,

  True. But there'd be no way for Comcast to identify a particular IP
address as assigned to a dial-up connection is there? That's what I meant to
ask.

Yes, there are RBL's (called DUL's) of netblocks used by ISP's for
dial-up.

Actually, I believe PPP and IP are completely seperate protocols. I have
used PPP without any IP at all in the past. (IPX only)

So it would be correct to say that the DHCP exchange takes place after the
PPP session has been established.

No.  Yes, they are separable; PPP can negotiate network addresses  for
IPX, AppleTalk and probably other stuff too.  But no, it does not use
DHCP; it happens within PPP. See 'NCP' in the RFC:
http://www.zvon.org/tmRFC/RFC1661/Output/index.html

Message-ID: <40CA4ABA.9050002@linuxlink.com>

I had a hard drive crash today on the mailserver.  I deciced it would be 
a good time to change from unix mail files to Maildir

Postfix is doing all the right stuff and putting the mail in.  It looks 
ugly but it is working

parts of main.cf

#home_mailbox = Mailbox
home_mailbox = Maildir/

#
#mailbox_command = /usr/bin/procmail
#mailbox_command = /some/where/procmail -a "$EXTENSION"
mailbox_command = /usr/bin/procmail -a "$EXTENSION"  DEFAULT=$HOME/Maildir/
MAILDIR=$HOME/Maildir


Why does this look so ugly and cludgelike?

i see the mail in the ~/Maildir/new

I could find no place to alter ipop3d and no docs on it either.  Since i 
altered the main.cf for postfix I feel pretty sure i need to do 
something to the pop3 server.

It will not pop the mail with a client so i tried this.

Now that looks like an authentication issue.

I have googled till blue in the face and can't come on the problem or 
the solution.

What did I do wrong?

I found documentation and it all says to recompile imap after changing 
the config file.  This is redhat 9. there should be around that, no?

You are volunteering at Free Geek.  Their Thrift Store offers most Linux 
Disto's on CD for $2 per disk.  That is $6 - $8 per distro, and as a 
volunteer, you get a 50% discount.  What could be an easier way to get them?  
If you want to make your own copies you can do it with Linux or Windows, you 
just need a burner and software.  If you find cd-record in Linux too 
intimidating, you can install Linux Mandrake 10 or Fedora Core 2, which have 
the nice GUI K3B burner, where you can just click on the "copy cd" Icon.  On 
Windows, you can use EZ CD Creator, Nero, NTI, others, to copy CD's, it does 
not matter that they are Linux CD's you are copying on Windows.

If you need a computer with RedHat 9.0, or Fedora Core 2 preloaded, the store 
at Free Geek has about one or two computers available each week, priced 
around $80 (thats $40 to volunteers after discount).  Usually PIII 500 -550 
class, with 256M RAM, and the Disks come with them.

Free Geek.  You said you were working in the build program there.  In the 
store : Knoppix, Free Duc, Overclockix, Mandrake Move, all Linux Demos = $2.

Note: Free Geek has a policy that allows volunteers to work on their personal 
computers at Free Geek with the permission, and under the supervision of the 
Build instructor.   I am sure they would guide you through a dual boot 
install.  Problem solved.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0406112151090.6635-100000@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm using vanilla 2.4.25 kernel.org source and patching 
it to 2.4.26.  I want to add the hostap driver.  I have 
hostap-0.1.2.tar.gz with a patch for kernel 2.4.20.  If 
I make a linux-2.4.20 link to 2.4.23 source, it patches 
that source just fine.  Apparently, a different 
Makefile.wireless causes a reject trying that same trick 
against 2.4.26.  I know this code works, though security 
may be better with a newer version.  

Anyone know where a copy of hostap that works with 
2.4.26 can be found?  I've googled for it, but I'm 
off track.  It's hard to see in lynx.  A lot of 
debian patches are popping up, but I'm interested 
in finding the source and creating or using a new 
patch.  I'm on Redhat 7.3 right now.

My 5100 is just a term old.  Redhat 9 on it 
had problems locking up occasionally running 
X.  Gentoo isn't locking up, but I don't know 
how to get maple 9.02 working fully.  I'm 
checking out gentoo primarily as a replacement 
Linux distro for Redhat 9 to run maple and 
prolog.  If only I knew which libraries to 
emerge in gentoo to get the graphical version 
running.  Command line maple seems to work 
okay in gentoo.  I didn't get maple to install 
directly to gentoo, I tarred up an installation 
from Redhat 9.  All the maple files are in my 
home directory, but where maple expects to find 
libraries on my gentoo system could be a problem.

As far as gaming goes, I've played Warcraft II using the XP Home that 
came with it.  I already hate XP.  McAffee that came with XP demanded to
be registered and put an annyoing window in my face I couldn't get rid 
of.  The moment it saw a network connection, XP assumed it could get to
the net.  Talk about a dumb assumption.   I've tried freeciv under 
Linux.  I have sound in Redhat and gentoo, though I've noticed mixer 
problems
in gentoo and occasional loss of sound with gnome saying that the card 
is busy or something.

I don't know if you can get bios and hardware design specs for Dell 
laptops.  It has been frustrating enough with this computer, I
wish I had thought more about their awful tv ads.  Laptop manufacturers 
need to inform buyers better about what is abnormal in
their products.

If you get a Thinkpad, be aware that some have problems even with 
Windows.  My brother-in-law's german thinkpad being a prime example.
You'll likely need to buy old to get that laptop that, "just works."  It 
seems the choice is: "new and powerful, but partially incompatible," 
verses,
"compatible, but old, slow, and some amount of screen wear."  The price 
for old, around $600 US, doesn't compete with new.  My laptop was
about $1100 US with a screen upgrade.  The better screen put it over 
$1000.  A web site, apparently put up by a PSU student who installed
debian on one of these, says not to go without the better screen.  I 
don't  know if Dell's are cheap because  compatibility corners are being 
cut,
or if it's just the 7 lbs of weight.  I wouldn't buy the m500, for that 
kind of money I'd seriously consider the ibook or a Toshiba laptop. 

Has Toshiba become Linux friendly with their laptops?  The companies

Plus, in theory, it's possible that spam senders might interpret the
reject message and update their lists. Maybe.

To spell it out even more clearly for Rich:

* If you bounce, your mail server constructs a message and delivers it
to the "From:" address.

* If you reject, you send a 500-series SMTP code and the remote server
is responsible for forming a bounce message for its users. Nothing
more happens.

* If you drop, you send a 250 SMTP code and the other side thinks it
delivered the email successfully. This has the deleterious side
effects for potentially good mail that Paul mentioned, in addition to
making spam servers think they've got a live one.

Notice how between dropping and rejecting you *maybe* save 10 bytes
*during* the SMTP session by dropping -- depending on the length of
your server's human readable messages. That's it. No further server
load or network traffic whatsoever.

The latest version is 0.7.1.

Debian testing: libwpd4 (version 0.6.5)
Gentoo: libwpd (version 0.6.6 is in x86, 0.7.1 in ~x86)

Help!

I noticed when I ran ps -aux this morning that the cron daemon had
launched some root processes with the word "zombie" in them and later
there was a ping to 216.115.108.243 followed by a "[ping <zombie>]." I
don't like the look of this...  Then I tried to reboot. And couldn't.

Anyone know what this means when I try to reboot, and how to fix it?

I think I can confirm this. I just came back from N.J. While there, I
replied to an email that came to my Comcast account, and the reply was
rejected. I routinely reply to the sender when home with no problems. I
was a bit surprised by the rejection, but simply set the reply from my
work email account.

Subject: [PLUG] System Configuration Records
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0406121024280.24890@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I've become cavalier about keeping hardcopy records of system setup and
configuration. It's time to correct this and I want to check with you
professional SysAdmins about the information I need to record for each host.

  What I have so far are the outputs from 'hdparm -i' for the two hard
drives, the output from 'df -h', /etc/fstab, and the contents of each /proc
file that made any sense at all to keep (cpuinfo, devices, filesystems,
modules, partitions, pci, swap and version). They're all in a file,
<hostname>.configuration, with each section labeled by source.

  What's missing?

Thanks,

Rich

I can answer this...

I'm a backup mail server for another domain. My system accepts mail for 
the other domain, and then tries to deliver it to the destination.

If the destination rejects the message, then my system must bounce the 
message to the original server, to let the sender know that they didn't 
get through.

Cool, P-90 with 8MB standard and a 640x480 color display.
I was just thinking of making a Compaq Aero 4/25 run Linux.

It is remotely possible.  And I mean *remotely*.  After figuring out the
protocol, you'd need to program a microcontroller to read the keyboard
and spit out PS/2 keycodes, then build another, high-powered
microcontroller with several hundred KB of RAM (framebuffer) and three
high-speed A/D converters to digitize the analog VGA signal and convert
it to the appropriate commands for the display.

This is, in fact, a FAQ that has been around since laptops were new.
I'd have said to STFW, but it was fun coming up with a serious answer.

Hold down F1 while turning the machine on.

I also have a dell 5100 dual booting gentoo/xp, I havent tried suspending to 
RAM, but for the $800 I saved by getting the dell instead of a comparable 
IBM, I dont mind powering it off :-)  I also have a bad taste in my mouth 
from all the dealings we have had at work with IBM.  Hopefully their laptops 
are better than their workstations.

You can check if there's a problem in the image without burning it with a
command like this:

# mount -t iso9660 -o loop cd-image.iso mount-point/

I have never done a CD-based install myself. I have always done network
installs. You end up downloading much smaller amounts of data and it's just
as easy as a CD install.

I also recommend the 'testing' distribution in preference to 'stable',
unless you are fanatical about security. The packages in testing are very
up-to-date but are not quite as bleeding-edge as 'unstable'. Stable packages
are often very old. Testing also has a very nice new installer:

http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/

You will probably want the 50MB CD image for a network install.

I was beginning to wonder how a machine could be updated to a new
kernel for security reasons and not have to be rebooted.  Thus, uptime
really is never that impressive.  I'd think a better impressive mark
was a machine that wasn't hacked.  That would show a better maintained
system and allow you to sleep better at night.

Then again, anyone who is carrying a system around a campus with a UPS
unit most likely doesn't care much about security and more about it
never stopping.  Heck, it was pretty useless running around campus
with a UPS unit attached off a network.

Rod,

  Does Xprint install _with_ CUPS or does it _replace_ CUPS?

  I wonder, too, if it works with firefox as well as mozilla.

if the Comcast subscriber you're referring to is using their own mail

There are days I wonder if the Oregonian has enough pages for a

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0406121659370.26710@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  According to the man page I have for 'dump', it works with ext2. Will it
also work with ext3 and reiserfs? Also, it's supposed to work with modern
tape drives using hardware compression by not specifying a compression
factor or medium capacity. Has anyone tried this?

  If I specify a 0-level backup of /, I presume that I get the entire
filesystem (including nfs-mounted ones?) on one big volume on the tape. Is
this correct?

  Anyone using dump & restore on linux?

Thanks,

Rich

It will not work with reiserfs, and it only 'may' work with ext3 (not
directly familiar). It will not work with nfs at all.

dump/restore are apparently very powerful and cool and all that, but
those of us in the "not-dump-thank-you" camp dislike it for its ties
to a specific filesystem. And that's all that needs to be said about
that flamewar, I think. (i.e., we have our sides, and we should remain
amicable.)

This could be a number of things, bad software or bad hardware. Google
for "zombie process" would give you the story. Simply a process which has
terminated, but no one has wait()ed for/retrieved the return code. In
most cases either a shell or init is the one doing this. Zombies are
common, just most of the time they don't stick around long enough for you
to catch them with `ps` (though on machines with CS students taking an OS
courses they're *very* common  :-).

That zombie processes are hanging around long enough for you to spot them
is a bad sign. I'd tend to worry about questionable hardware first, then
a bad Linux installation, and finally some root kits cause software to
fail in this way. Start with running memtest, if you eliminate hardware,
then you'll be reloading (and reloading might be good anyway as your
installation could now be corrupt).

It works fine with ext3.  You would need a special dump designed for
reiserfs.  (I haven't used it, if it even exists.)

This is only true if you have your tape devices set up "properly".  I've
never been able to get that working, so I use gzip compression.  ;-)

Nope.  You tell dump the raw device to dump (e.g. /dev/Volume00/root,
/dev/hda3, /dev/md2, etc.) and it only dumps that.  If you have /, /home,
etc. you'll need a separate dump command for each one.

Yep, every day!  ;-)

  Harumph! That's no fun. So, ... what are folks to do who need to implement
a low-cost backup strategy on a limited budget?

  Well, I've heard that some folks dislike Xfce because they have bad
memories of working on systems with cde as the window manager. And I dislike
the "look-n'-feel" of winduhs, which is one reason I don't run KDE or Gnome.
But, that then limits modern day linux users to cpio, tar and commercial
products then. No?

Would this installer help fix a semi-borked upgrade from stable to testing? System's not seriously borked; I managed to get rid of most of the problem, but I'm still having this:

On tape, tar works fine.

On disk, rsync works fine.

GNU tar support incremental backups; star is supposed to be pretty fast
and no doubt also supports incrementals.  Or, I could sell you a nice
copy of Microlite BackupEDGE for about $300, with a nice curses
interface, compression, and on-tape crypto. :)

dump was especially attractive in the days when tar couldn't do
incrementals; restore has a nice interactive interface that lets you
select specific files to restore.  dump was also rsh-aware, so it could
be used over a network.  (Naturally, GNU tar supports this also.)  I've
generally used dump, but I have some concerns over reliability, because
dump backs up at the filesystem layer and the newer Linux kernels
('newer' being 2.2 or so) have issues with buffer cache that make it
impossible to guarantee that a program like dump can read a consistent
raw filesystem.  These days, I'm personally using tar for my backups.

Dell racks ain't that bad, but Chatsworth is the brand most folks use,
Graybar stocks 'em.  When I was working at OSDL, we bought lots of
racks, so we had 'em custom-made by Crystal Lite.  You really gotta know
what you want in that case.

Just to add to the fun, some filesystems like XFS have snapshot capability 
and that will give you a guaranteed non-changing view of the filesystem to 
copy out with anything from scp to rsync to tar.  Alternatively, you can 
use LVM in some cases to get snapshots.  If you have a dynamically 
changing system that needs to be all in sync for a backup to be meaningful 
(i.e. databases in general), then snapshots are very, very handy.

I like snapshots myself because (at least with some databases) you can get 
a clean database copy while it is live.  Very handy for those 4am 
emergency runs to the colo...

Best,
Kyle

It works through, as I understand it, CUPS or whatever print spooler you 
use.  Since it is being pretty heavily invested in my Mozilla.Org I'd bet 
so.  Here is the xprint page:

	http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xprint/

Though it needs a bit of grammar and spell checking (like I have room to 
criticize) it explains the goals.  Pretty loafty.

I have noticed that it doesn't support multiple copies, via Mozilla, out
of the box and I haven't taken the time to get it _really_ configured so I
can't say if this is a bug or pebkac. Still having access to both the
printers on my home network is great.  I have also noticed that multiple
printe jobs may have a pretty long pause between coming out.  I needed
eight copies of a HTML formated work sheet.  I printed it eight times 
heard the printer going.  Logged off and noticed that the printer was 
(appeared) finished and grabbed the sheets and ran.  Got to class and 
founbd I only had six copies.  Got home that evening and found the other 
two sitting on the printer.  Moral is (this far into the story) is don't 
print at the last minute and remember to count what you pick up.

Yes, in any case it fails on this line:

+ /usr/sbin/modules-config apache-ssl internal

the which I cannot say, because I don't know what modules-config apache-ssl _internal_ does/ requires such that it dies.

Thank you for asking. I'm not currently using apache on that box- I plan to "soon" but I have other testbeds for development I'm using. :)

The box is primarily used for ssh and backups, so apache isn't /required/. Although it'd be nice not to use my personal site for development, I'm doin ok. :)

A zombie process is one that has terminated but whose parent process hasn't
called wait() to clean up. It will only exist while the parent process is
still running; once the parent process terminates init inherits the process
and cleans up.

Zombie processes are the result of sloppy programming. Sometimes that's all
it is.

However, the presence of weird zombie processes was what alerted me once 
to the fact that my system had been compromised and rootkit'ed.

Then just remove it and reinstall it.  If it ain't configured, you won't
lose anything.

If you're worried about losing dependent packages by removing the apache
package, install apache-perl first (which I use instead of the vanilla
apache module and the separate mod_perl package), that way the apache
depdencies will be met and you can remove the packages giving you trouble.

If you're worried about losing the apache configuration, just backup
/etc/apache* to someplace else.

It's a kludge, but it's the easiest way I can see to do it without digging
in with my own hands or giving extremely detailed directions.

(I guess that's probably the motivation behind the retry/reboot/reinstall
method of MS Winders support -- except for the fact that many things
simply cannot be resolved without at least rebooting.)

Anyway, I would try dumping those packages and then installing them.

I've repeatedly tried to convince them that they need a dump program for
the folks who feel tar's weaknesses are crucial, but they still haven't
written one.

The consistancy problem hits *both* tar and dump, just in different ways.
They'll simply get incomplete/incorrect backups in different ways. I note
though that the LVM snapshot capability makes dump work perfectly, but in
order for tar to work you need to mount the snapshot. The thought that
occurs is; could a journaling filesystem simply implement a journal-only
mode where all changes go to the journal, resulting in a dumpable
snapshot without needing LVM or another layer?


I have to vote for dump. The consistancy problems aren't much worse and
the completeness dump offers is *far* superior to what tar offers. GNU
tar does get it right most of the time, but it won't be anywhere near as
complete as dump.

Specifically dump guarentees that you will get *every* file once.
Hardlinks *will* be perfectly preserved (GNU tar does a very good job,
but doesn't guarentee it). Crucially, restore will also remove files, so
you don't end up with a complete history of every single file that has
ever existed, as well as correctly taking care of files that have moved
(and won't need to dump the file data if that is already backed up).
Extra filesystem information will also be preserved, such as nodump,
immutable, and append-only flags; crucial if you use those flags. Much
more crucially extra data such as extended ACLs *will* be preserved by
dump, while tar is incapable of handling extended ACLs.


It does come down to choose your form of poison. To me dump's
completeness is a crucial advantage. While dump is filesystem specific,
practically all filesystems have dump (and note that restore is *not* FS
specific); if I'm in a situation where I need ReiserFS, I imagine I'll
also have the funds to encourage the developers to produce a dump
program. I know how to induce the same sorts of consistancy problems in
tar that dump is subject to, so what advantage is left for tar?

Keep in mind that in a journaling filesystem, only the filesystem metadata
(inode entries, data pointers, etc.) are journalled-- the actual data in
the files is not.  (There may be some exeptions for very small changes,
depending on which journaling filesystem is in use.)

The Veritas filesystem has a snapshot mode that does what you describe for
both the data and the filesystem metadata, without regard for which LVM is
in use.

  I've been happily using BRU the past 7 years; I'm not happy about their
new support prices and policies, but that's a different story. They went
belly-up a couple of years ago but were resucitated by management buying the
remains and going back in business as The TOLIS Group.

  But, a friend needs a back up strategy for his mission-critical server and
he has a very limited budget. I've encouraged him to put the money in a good
tape drive and use free software until he can afford something commercial.

  Well, there's also AMANDA and a bunch of other free software for linux
available via the Storage Mountain Web site.

Or start using rcs to maintain revision control on your configuration
files.  The easiest way to start using it is to create an "RCS"
directory in the /etc/ and /etc/<whatever> directories.  Check in your
configuration files with the ci -u <configuration file>.  Check out the
file for modification by co -l <configuration file>.  You can go back to
a certain version by co -l -r <version>.  

Just don't short circuit the versioning by changing the mode of a
configuration file or by doing a :w! in vi or its equivalent in your
editor.

AMANDA is really just a wrapper; it internally uses dump or tar.  It's a
system for automating network backups and probably wouldn't help your
friend much.

We had a recent 'experience' with Dell rackmount equipment.  Lack of
experience (I wasn't involved in the buy so can really said "It wasn't
me").  Dell racks are much deeper than 'normal' racks.  Some Dell
LCD/keyboard/mouse units were bought and they were too long to fit in our
normal cabinets.  30" I think.  Suggest you watch your sizes when ordering 
and determine what you'll put in them or them in before hand.

I feel like a skipping record, but:

Disk to disk backups.  http://www.keithl.com/linuxbackup.html .

Large disks are getting exponentially cheaper over time (occasionally
on sale for 50cents/GB) while tapes are not getting cheaper at all,
and the large format tape media often run $1/GB and require >$1K drives,
with further expenditures for good tape management software.

With an rsync-based, hard-linked backup protocol, you can safely fold
multiple backups over the same space.  Restore can be as simple as 
swapping hard drives, depending on the strategy chosen.  Individual
file recovery takes seconds, not hours.  Complete file system format
independence, and complete verifiability.  Media (generic IDE drives)
are easy to find.

I have access to daily filesystem snapshots for the last 9 months (when
I started backing up to disk with rsync).  Because I swap drives, I
sometimes have to exchange a backup drive out of the fire resistant
safe, but typically the files I need span multiple backups.

Tar and dump?  Why not use paper tape?  Granted I still keep a tape
drive around for reading these old formats, but it can take between
hours and days to locate really old data on a tape in a box in the
storage locker.  

Tape is DEAD!  Skipping record off!

Keith

PS:  Last week I was back east and visited the crypto museum at the 
NSA.  In their computer room, they had an old StorageTek tape library,
3000 100MB tapes in a big barrel shaped room with a handling robot.
It is amusing to think that I have better capability in a half-height
slot, though admittedly less fun to watch. (please change subject line
if you follow this paragraph up)

Short answer was yes, but they are filled up.

Going to the source might answer that
http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2004 , but the quote listed:
"All of the Volunteer Opportunities Are Filled -- Thank you for your
interest in volunteer opportunities at OSCON. At this time, we're not
taking any additional requests for volunteering at the convention."

They did ask for volunteers earlier this year.

Keith,

  He had done this. When the lightning storm hit that system both disks were
essentially fried. It's rather difficult too, to grab the backup medium if
there's a fire or if someone breaks in and steals the system with both
drives in it.

> Tape is DEAD!  Skipping record off!

  Nah, it's just resting. For some of us, peace of mind that our
business-critical data are on tapes either in a different room or completely
off site is worth the cost of drive and media.

  Choices. That's what FOSS is about. Choices. One size never fits all. :-)

Solution to this: drive mounted in external firewire or USB case,
attach it for a weekly scheduled backup, and put it into a fireproof
safe at other times.

Ryan,

  I suppose that could work, but many of us squeeze years of extra service
from hardware because linux doesn't require the latest and greatest. Older
PII systems don't have firewire or USB.

Thanks for the thought,

I beg to differ.  I used a firewire card on my PII system, you can buy
a PCI adapter for about $15.

120GB drive: $91 (priced at enuinc)
Firewire case: $36 (priced at enuinc)
Firewire card: $15 (priced at enuinc)
Firewire cable: $10-$20 depending upon length (priced from memory)

I'd imagine this would qualify as a reasonable backup solution on a
budget for a mission critical system.

... or a removable drive tray to hold an ide drive, under $20, and it will 
work with old systems (don't know if there are trays for MFM).

Has anyone heard of a recent MS Windows worm that deletes files in "My Music" and creates strange powerpoint files (or files that end in ppt) ? I just had the weirdest email from my mother...

I've got a problem and I hope that a bunch of you can help.

Free Geek has a LARGE stack of Fujitsu Stylistic 1000 tablet computers
with lots of stuff to go with them. They are 486 based, but they do run
Vector Linux.

I have tried to get various groups, such as Personal TelCo to take them
and a lot of folks have taken 5 or 10 or so at a whack.

But there are still a LOT of them sitting right outside my door and Geek
Prom is coming up this weekend.

So...

Come and get them NOW. As many as you want. More than you want.

It would be a shame to recycle these guys, but that is exactly what is
going to happen Tuesday afternoon around 3-4. If you want any of them,
you have to come get them before then.

Free Geek is closed today, but I'm in the office most of the day (and
there is someone else here, too). Give me a call at 503-267-3250 before
you come over and I will make sure that there is someone here to let you
in.

These are really cool little machines and I really don't want to see
them ground up and sold as scrap. So come take them away. Now. Please.

Peace,
-Ron

I just found this site on how to get an OS installed on 'em:

Ron:

Do these come with the PCMCIA storage cards, or is it up to us to provide
our own?

Moreover, most boxes have ethernet.  Backing up over the network
(ssh-piped) is trivial.  I am backing up 25Gig over a broadband
(Comcast!) network with an rsync-based procedure, and it takes about
15 minutes (once you have a remote copy).  Building burns down?  No
problem.

I just searched The Pile and found none with storage.  In order to do
anything with the tablets an ATA PCMCIA card will be needed.  (There are
PCMCIA adapters that will make Compact Flash and other card memory formats
behave like an ATA disk.)

Also, there did not seem to be any power adapters aside from the metal
in-car docking station, which weighs about 8 pounds and probably takes
12VDC.  There is a power connector on the tablet itself which is reported
to be 16VDC 2.5A positive tip by this site:

Thanks for the research and for taking away some of these, Steve.

When the pile was fresh, there were certainly some with storage cards,
etc. As the pile shrinks, some of the choicer tidbits go.

So GET YOURS WHILE THEY'RE HOT!

I only have 30-40 left. Tomorrow afternoon, the remaining stuff goes to
Recycling. It really is a shame to trash these cute little tablet
computers.

Peace,

Yep, and the worst-case-scenario is that we can't get them working and
they end up right back at FreeGeek for recycling.  Again.  ;-)

I too searched the pile. Found one box with documentation in it, took

Got a couple of docking stations (the car type) and will be reworking 
that to work on 110... :)

Fun fun fun.

What I would like is someone with a little more experience to point out 
some of the PCMCIA tidbits that are needed.

Once I know what I'm looking for, I can usually find things. But these

Russ,

  A google search on that make and model turned up many pages with
information on the specs and what accessories _were_ (perhaps still are)

Well, it was quite a feeding frenzy while it lasted. But now there are
only about 10-15 left, so I am going home. I will be back here at 9am
tomorrow morning and you can grab what's left at that time. As soon as
these last few are gone, the remaining docking stations, PS/2 ultra
compact keyboards, and other stuff are off to recycling.

Thanks for everyone who showed up! And if you *really* are disappointed,
be here at 9am and grab the last few.

Peace,

Subject: [PLUG] Knoppix wins again
Message-ID: <20040615023553.GA13878@gate.kl-ic.com>

Amusing story:

Last week I was back east in MD visiting my wife's family.  While
there, I usually get sucked into computer maintenance.  On &%#*!!
Windoze machines.  Sister-in-law Susan's Windoze 98 machine decided
it didn't want to talk to Comcast anymore.  Comcast had told her
"we don't support 98 anymore" and suggested she buy a WinXP capable
machine before they would help her.  Not likely, for a single mom
with a daughter starting college.

After an hour of fruitless poking and prodding (Windoze appeared to
not want to route packets beyond the local net), I gave up and booted
the machine from the Knoppix disk.  DHCP did its automagical thing
and she was online.  I showed her and her kids how to use Mozilla,
Konqueror, and GAIM, and indicated that there was far more on the
Knoppix disk to play with as well.  She was fascinated - "you say
this is free?"

She is still hoping that someone will come along and help her get
Windoze 98 working again, but this seems unlikely.  I am hoping
she will get used to Knoppix, and I can convince her to do a Xandros
(Debian) install.  This would be very cool.  Suggestions for a smooth
transition would be appreciated.

This matters, because she is the head of the legislation drafting
department for the Maryland state legislature.  It was her department
(before she was head of it) that helped draft the UCITA legislation, 
the Microsoft-sponsored replacement for the Uniform Commercial Code,
stripping consumers of normal contract and commercial rights in
software.  Only Maryland and Virginia have passed this legislation,
the rest of the states have said "this stinks".  Perhaps with
sister Susan in the FOSS-friendly camp, UCITA will be more likely
to get repealed in Maryland.

I have a similar joke for the talk, but it refers to Windows systems.

Can someone bring a laptop?  And will there be a projector?

Subject: [PLUG] Where Linux is today
Message-ID: <40CE9407.7020507@spiretech.com>

While making my way through the July Linux Journal, what at first seemed 
to be an unremarkable sentence suddenly jumped out at me as being very 
profound.

In Marcel Gagne's regular COOKING WITH LINUX article, the first sentence 
of the third paragraph is as follows:

'As many of you know, Microsoft Windows remains a part of the average 
business IT department.'

Think about the significance of that sentence, and especially the words 
'remains' and 'average'.  Five years ago that sentence would have been a 
partisan boast; today it is the understated truth about what is 
happening in the world because of Linux and the open-source software 
movement.

Think of yourself as one of the initial stockholders of a very special 
technology IPO (symbol LNX).  The stock price did not jump when it first 
hit the market; rather, it simply began increasing at a significant and 
steady rate.  (Analysts are amazed; the price of LNX keeps rising 
regardless of market conditions, and it always pays great dividends!)

Thanks Linus.  Welcome to Portland.

Folks,

In order to avoid the tragedy of dispersing all these fujitsu units to 
various places where many of them may languish unused or missing parts 
etc., I propose to try and keep rough track of who has what.  Scenario: 
if the units I scrounged fall into disuse, but e.g. Kurt needs a battery 
for one of his, it is to his benefit to be able to ping me and see if I 
can spare one.

I have:
12 units (all untested as yet)
	- Most all have batteries
	- None have storage
	- Only two (!) have stylus
6 keyboards
4 "lever" mobile base stations

Does someone have some wiki-space handy upon which we might post this as

Sure yeah youbetcha.
I have 
6 units (2 sans batteries, 6 sans storage)
--the remaining 4 are all in cases
2 automobile lever cases
1 stylus.

I'm looking for storage (hah!) and 16.5 power supplies,
or ideas on how to convert the automobile lever thing to household current,
because it has ports on it for other items.  
A keyboard would be nice too.

I think I have my pcmcia CF reader and a 64 MB card around somewhere; I'm hoping that's enough for a tiny linux install.

I saw a spot on the wiki for the Personal Telco Project where they discussed these, but I don't necessarily think that's the best place to stick our info. I can set up something if nobody has anything right now.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0406151121290.3986-100000@gisnet.com>

I just recently replaced my old RH 7.3 server with RH 8.0 and noticed that
wu-ftpd has been replaced by vsftpd. I had set up a couple of users on my
old system to have ftponly access, but I can't figure out how to do that
with vsftpd. The new /etc/vsftpd.ftpusers file looks pretty different from
the old /etc/ftpusers, there is no /etc/ftponly shell, and I have various
other questions. First of all where are there docs that explain how to
confiure and manage vsftpd?

I've googled, but not really found the magic search terms for "Everything
You've Always Wanted to Know About vsftpd"; I've found
/usr/share/doc/vsftpd*, but those docs are very minimal; I've looked
through /etc/vsftpd.conf, but didn't see anything about guest users; I've
searched the distro CD ROMs for HOWTOs, and not found any, and I've
downlaoded and read the PDFs from the RedHat docs site for 8.0 (where I
found a little bit about securing vsftpd.)

So I have two questions:
1. Where do I find more in-depth docs on working with vsftpd?
2. How do I set up guest FTP users (private accounts with only FTP upload 
and download privs)?

TIA,

Bill,

  I believe that annonymous ftp is both better supported and more widely
used than are private accounts. Most ftp servers will run in a chroot jail
so annonymous users can log in, upload and download but never see anything
on the system outside the jail.

ProFTP supports fully private/chroot'ed accts. Even using ".htaccess"
style "not-real" accounts.

I have about 10. No batteries, styluses, storage cards or power supplies.
Two of the behemoth 50 pound soviet steel docking stations, 2 of the lighter
docking stations. I also took about 12 keyboards. 
I got there kind of late :(
I also have a couple keys. Apparently they all work in all of the docking
stations. 

I would appreciate a battery if anyone had a working one (and have tons of
other computer stuff to trade ;)

Folks,

In order to avoid the tragedy of dispersing all these fujitsu units to 
various places where many of them may languish unused or missing parts 
etc., I propose to try and keep rough track of who has what.  Scenario: 
if the units I scrounged fall into disuse, but e.g. Kurt needs a battery 
for one of his, it is to his benefit to be able to ping me and see if I 
can spare one.

I have:
12 units (all untested as yet)
	- Most all have batteries
	- None have storage
	- Only two (!) have stylus
6 keyboards
4 "lever" mobile base stations
2 "flat" port extender or desktop? stations

Does someone have some wiki-space handy upon which we might post this as 
well as tips for getting things working locally (e.g. PDX sources for 
cheap 16.5v adapters, etc.)?

Good idea.  I have 
2 units (untested as yet)
        - Both have batteries
        - Neither has storage
1 "lever" mobile base station

Now for a question: What is the connector needed for the external
16.5V power?  I borrowed a power supply that can be set to numerous
output voltages (including 16v at 2A) and comes with a set of various
tips.  None of these tips fit any orifice I could find on the tablet.

Don't think so. I have a bunch of old laptops (dating back to 486's) - every
single thinkpad that I've received over the years has worked after I got all
the parts for it. I've never had one go on "the shooting pile".

This site claims it's a "standard Fujitsu laptop power connector":

I haven't yet found my Fujitsu adapter to verify this...

Can't do that. I don't want client1 to be able to even know about
client2's files. I don't want anonymous uploads, but I want individual
clients to be able to uplaod and download via FTP in their own directory
"jails", and NOT have accounts with e-mail and interactive console privs.

Thanks, but I'm still looking for the sysadmin docs for vsftpd. Since it's 
packaged as the default FTP server with RH 8 and 9, I figure there ought 
to be some explanation somewhere else besides a $50 book that's out of 
date in a year or two. Or am I already out of date trying to set up 
vsftpd? ;-)

This is tough for a newbie. Until you know the lore, it's hard to find 
your way around. I sure hope the docs aren't "Read the source. The code 
speaks for itself."

Thanks in advance for any help,

As others said, zombies - in and of themselves - are not bad things. Ones

IMHO, the best thing to do is check the system with chkrootkit:

Hoo, yes! Me too. Fortunately, their programming stinks, and their tracks
were everwhere (not to mention that init 6 simply wedged the machine.)
That happened several days ago, and I couldn't wait for advice, so I
scraped that RH 7.3 system off and tried to install RH 9. Had some problem
with it bouncing all e-mail with "Relaying denied" errors, so I tried RH
8.0. That worked like a charm, and so far, it's been two days and my
system hasn't been sacked and looted yet...

Wish I knew more about security (I've been hacked twice now. Linux is no 
better than Windows in the security dept. if the administrator thinks 
he'll get 20 minutes to get the shields up. You pop up on the net with a 
naive virgin system these days, and the barbarians assault you almost 
immediately!)

> IMHO, the best thing to do is check the system with chkrootkit:

Thanks... I'll check that out. Hopefully I'll not need it ever again, but
I'll grab at all straws to learn how to handle a Linux system.

Man, there's a LOT to learn, and you have to learn it all at once or you 
pay the price!

A quick anecdote.  This very morning, my wife rolls me out of bed with
the words: "something weird is happening with the computer".  Enough
to wake me out of a sound slumber.  I grogily stumbled out into the
computer room where she'd been doing her usual pre-work email-reading,
news-surfing ritual and found an xterm with top running in it.  The
xterm title bar had the local hostname and top showed a bunch of
unfamiliar usernames.  Oh crap, thought I.  Hours of recovery
stretched out in front of me.  Disruption and unhappiness.  I went to
my other box, which has a serial console to my firewall/router and ran
tcpdump on the external interface.  Hmm.  Just a bunch of arp and DHCP
traffic, and some ssh traffic to my wife's account at work.  I down
the internal interface on the router to choke off the external
connection to the "compromised" host.  Then I go back to the
"compromised" host and "top" has frozen.  Hmm.  I open another local
xterm and run another top.  No wacky usernames.  I go back to the
router console and up the internal interface, and after a few moments
the first "top" recovers.  That "top" was running on my wife's work
box.  She had slogin'd to it and was running top there, not on the
local host.  Suddenly the wacky usernames didn't seem so wacky.  Big
sigh of relief.  I pointed out that a desktop menu will run an
ssh-tunneled xterm on her work machine directly, which would have
minimized the confusion over where top was running and crawled back
into bed.

All you need to do is set the shell for those users to /dev/null.  This
is done in the /etc/passwd file, the last entry for each user is the
login shell and ftp access doesn't need a real shell.  The false shell
(/bin/false) is supposed to work, but I've had better luck just setting
it to /dev/null.  Also check the privileges on all of your system
directories, to make sure that the ftp users can't write and/or browse
anywhere they are not wanted.

BTW, the ftp protocol sends passwords over the network in the clear,
which means that anyone that can sniff packets coming to your ftp server
can get the usernames and passwords for your ftp accounts.  I consider
this to be a major security problem.  Teach your users about WinSCP
instead.

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

How can I get the data that is in a file into a variable at the Command
line.
The file only has one line it it and I what to read the file and add
that one line to a variable.
I know cat file_name will show the data to the screen
so I tried  VAR1=[cat file_name] but that does not work.

It sure is a pain, isn't it?  :-)

I'm really sleepy right now, but it seems to me read can do this somehow.  

cat file_name | read VAR1

?

What I did the last time I had to tackle this is I think I did a 

VAR1="`cat file_name`"

with or without the quotes?  I do not recall.  But that's how I tackled it.

See the 'Command Substitution' section of the bash(1) man page, but in 
short...

   # the old-fashioned way
   VAR1=`cat file_name`

   # the posix way
   VAR1=$(cat file_name)

   # faster version of above
   VAR1=$(< file_name)

   # in case your file has multiple lines
   VAR1=$(head -n 1 file_name)

  I'm not sure I correctly understand your situation, but the rediretion

Thanks for the help folks, and I think I have the answers I need now. I'm
not sure that summaries are expected here, but since there are PLUG
archives that others might search, I thought I'd pull together the answers
I got into one document for anyone else who wants more info on vsftpd.

Steve Nelson pointed out the www.vsftpd.org site, which has information on
installing and configuring vsftpd from source, FreeBSD and rpm. There I
also found links to to the official vsftpd site at
http://vsftpd.beasts.org/. Both of these sites seem to have plenty of
information about the configuration files.

What I wanted to do was to limit certain users to FTP upload/download
services only, but I couldn't find an FTP only shell in my new system (it
was called /etc/ftponly on my old machine.) Derek Loree pointed out that
instead I can use the false shell, /bin/false, but he says that /dev/null 
works better for this purpose as the shell assigned to the user record in 
/etc/passwd.

He also mentioned that FTP protocol is insecure in that usernames and
passwords are sent in the clear, and can therefore be read by anyone
using packet sniffer. (Hmm... I learn something new and unpleasant about
security every day.) Anyway, he suggests that I have my users use WinSCP
instead, which is a secure Windows client for copying files back and
forth.

Keith Lofstrom responds:

The Infocus LP70 (1Kx768) projector will be there, my tiny little
screen will be there, and my thinkpad T30 laptop running RH9 with
OpenOffice 1.1.0 and Win4Lin/PPT97 will be there.  I will have the
CD drive installed, and can read USB sticks.  I'll try to remember
to bring the floppy drive so I can swap that in if needed.

In general, things work better if the presenter has their own laptop,
as it eliminates the variables of data transfer, presentation software
version, fonts, demos, etc.  Plan on bringing multiple media and
presentation formats, "just in case".  However, I will suffer great
inconvenience and uncertainty to hear about Programming Clusters...

And then investigate a tool like scponly for "hiding files from other

  For those who care, I've known Frank for 10 years now. I worked on behalf
of his company (Morse Bros., Inc.) when he was President and I'm still
working for them under their new ownership.

  Frank is one of the most honest, honorable, ethical and competent people
you will ever have the pleasure of meeting. Everything he says has been
carefully considered and well researched. In his first session in the Senate
he has earned the respect of everyone regardless of whether he/she is a R or
a D.

  Whatever he has to say is worth hearing.

I've had good experiences running Bastille on a dedicated system. Bastille
is a "hardening script" that is used to lock down Linux systems. The main
difficulty for new Linux users is answer the slew of questions the install
script asks. Of course, you still have to keep up to date on patches.

YMMV.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0406161742170.24485@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I have the Linksys wireless switch patched to the Linksys wired switch.
The patch cord goes from the uplink port on the wired switch to port 1 on
the WiFi switch.

  The problem is that I cannot reach the WiFi switch from any other host. I
can't ping it from a workstation that has the switch's IP address in
/etc/hosts, I can no longer access the admin setup with a browser (trying to
open the IP address results in the message 'network problems') and, of
course, neither portable can reach it via WiFi. The cards in the portables
have a strong, bright link light and now and then the activity light
flickers but any attempt to ping a workstation from a portable fails.

  What protocol and/or tools can help me identify the reason for this
'network problem'?

TIA,

Rich

As I remember, wasn't the original Bastille hacked by ignorant peasants
after a system crash in 1779, and its administrator guillotined? ;-)

But thanks for the tip!

Well, sure, but bastille-linux primarily secures a system from remote
attack and the original Bastille was secured against escape, not intrusion
from outside.

Just as the Bastille could be (and was) hacked by storming peasants from
outside, bastille-linux can be compromised by, say, simple physical
access.

I guess it's what they call "suitability for a particular purpose".

Actually, that's considered one of the main features of Bastille. Its
goal is to educate new users about security, since just plopping a
script down that purports to secure the system won't do anything if
the user remains ignorant.

Cannot reach == cannot admin, I assume.  First, simplify.  One laptop,
running dhcp, to one internal switch port on the WiFi switch, without
other hardware and protocols monkeying with things.  I strongly suspect
that some built-in NAT process in the wired switch is getting in there
and changing your addresses.  But it is hard to tell without more data;
Which brand/model of switches?  Is there a crossover cable where a
straight-through belongs, or vice versa?  Who supplies name service
and routing and internet connection and DHCP for your network?  Etc.

I don't think there is a tool or protocol that will solve your problem,
because I think the problem will be a configuration that works just fine
but does not match your intentions.  Fortunately, there is less than five
minutes of configuration on a typical WAP.  While that leaves plenty of
room for error, it does mean that a reset-and-start-from-scratch approach
is not too painful, assuming you have written down the sequence and the
config variables somewhere.

In my case, my Linksys BEFW11S4 WAP has a single internal port connected
through a crossover cable to an internal port of my straight-through
switches, with DHCP and NAT and routing and damned near everything
else turned off.  The admin IP address is set to a fixed internal
address that is not included in the internal DHCP address range.  Note,
this makes the transition from the default 192.168.1.1/password=admin
behavior of the WAP a little tricky, because partway through the
configuration the address range of the internal switch no longer matches
the IP address of the WAP.  

May I suggest putting loads of intended setup and procedure and
configuration data and observations into a text webpage, say
http://www.appl-ecosys.com/netproblem , and pointing us to that? 
Most of the time, just writing down everything you observe, and what
you are trying to do, will cause you to have the insight that solves
the problem.  But then, you are a scientist so you know that.

And once you do have it working, you have a nice start on a webpage to
help the rest of the world do what you have done.  The end of any open
source problem solving process is explaining, in triumph, how you made
something work.

It's a simple topological theorem.  All one need do is extrapolate the
Bastille into the 4th (or perhaps 5th since the "storming" is not
instantaneous), flip it inside out, then project it back down into the
original 3 (or 4) dimensions.  This preserves the integrity of the
Bastille and adapts it to protect from intrusion instead of escape.

Keith,

  And, cannot ping or access from the portables. It used to work with one
portable and I could access the admin stuff using opera.

  The Linksys BEFW11S4 for WiFi, Linksys 8-port wireline switch.

  No. I used the same cable that tied the WiFi to the former wireline port
and the cable that patched together the two 4-port wireline switches.

  Don't run dhcp. Each host contains /etc/hosts and the rest of the family.

  This was initially configured at the last clinic; I put in the MAC
addresses here and it was working -- for a couple of days -- with the IBM
ThinkPad.

  I try to ping/access the network from a portable with a WiFi adapter and
see 'network not reachable'. From a workstation -- or a portable on a
wireline connection -- ping gives no response. Within opera, when I try to
open 192.168.55.200 (the assigned IP address of the WAP) a box pops up
reading, 'network problem'. Nothing very insightful from a diagnostic
perspective.

  I'll work on this more this weekend. I'm off to a business meeting now.

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] gethostbyname() is evil
Message-ID: <200406182113.29326.athlonrob@axpr.net>

Hey-

I've been hacking away and sending patches for an OSS project lately that has 
hit a Linux roadblock.  For ease-of-use, they traditionally distribute static 
binaries (rather than dynamically linked ones), but that gives them grief 
because in two lines of code they need to resolve a hostname to an IP... 
currently with gethostbyname().

If you compile something with gethostbyname() statically, you receive this 
warning from gcc (and it's true):

rob at dell rob $ g++ -static test.cpp
/tmp/ccGzAkVB.o(.text+0x49): In function `main':
: warning: Using 'gethostbyname' in statically linked applications requires at 
runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking

In other words, it isn't proper to compile something static for multiple (old 
and new) distributions which is network aware.  Nice, huh?

Surely there is a workaround.  One method attempted (and failed) was utilizing 
a system call to ping -c 1 -w 1 hostname and parsing its output.  While it 
would have worked, apparently there are linux distros floating about where 
only root is allowed to use ping.  *sigh*

What do y'all do to get around this issue?  It's stupid, if you ask me.  There 
must be some REALLY good reason for the error to pop up.  Are there other, 
more universal than ping, utilities out there that'll resolve a hostname to 
an IP address?  Or some magic library you can link to that'll do its own 
gethostbyname-like function without these funky errors?

I'm stumped, google isn't turning much up.  Surely somebody out there has 
figured a way around this issue... no sense re-inventing this wheel.  :-)

Perhaps you can call a resolver library directly rather than using
gethostbyname(). Perhaps the adns library or Bernstein's library.

Subject: [PLUG] Setting up a postfix authenticated relay
Message-ID: <20040619140306.EEFC03F80DC@localhost>

I have a mail server running debian sarge/postfix+tls+sasl.  I would like 
to be able to set it up so I can use it as a relay from my laptop while I
am out and about.  So I don't set up a spam relay, I want to use tls+sasl
(whatever the correct combination  is) to encrypt and authenticate the
transfer/relay.

Can anybody give me pointers/clues/advice?

Thanks

You may have read this already.  Its a decent discussion of static linking
issues.
http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3E531639.4050605%40BitWagon.com

Here's another one specific to gethostbyname.
http://groups.google.com/groups?th=f0a07536f933ac3c&seekm=387C2ECA.ADAC079D%40webmaster.com


It seems the general consensus is to not statically link.  If/when you
get around this problem, I'd be interested in hearing how you
resolved (nyuk, nyuk) it.

Brian,

  I can tell you only what I do when away from the office (where the mail
server is running postfix). From my notebook I get an IP address whereever I
happen to be, then ssh to my network. Once logged in I invoke pine and read,
compose and reply to messages all from there. I don't run a local MUA or
have issues with mail stored on two systems.

  Don't know if this will fulfill your needs but it is simple enough for
mine.

HTH,

Rich

Thanks for the links...

I'll pass the first one along to somebody who understands more about this 
stuff than I.

I think things will be okay, however, by just getting around the 
gethostbyname() issue.  We'll see, I'll let you know how it works out...

http://postfix.state-of-mind.de/patrick.koetter/smtpauth/

I use saslauthd, and would recommend it. Postfix needs to be compiled 
with sasl2 support.

That howto should cover it all. Shouldn't be too painful to set up. :)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0406191047370.13699@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  The WiFi saga continues; Homer would be proud.

  Here's what's been achieved today:

	1) I can once again access the admin page for the WiFi switch from a
BUI. I suspect it was a less-than-fully-seated cable somewhere. To make a
long story short: it now works. I can now ping it by IP address or name.
Whew!

	2) I can ping other hosts on the lan from my Sony Vaio via the WiFi
card. But, I cannot get outside the lan. The interesting aspect about this
is that with the WiFi card inserted (and no wireline cable connected), both
eth0 and eth1 are apparently brought up. There are IP addresses for both.
When I explicitly invoke 'ifconfig eth0 down', 'ifconfig -a' shows it still
up with the IP address line, but it apparently is functionally shut down.
Because, now I can access the local network. PITA, but it works. Must be
something to do with net.agent, hotplug and the implementation by
EmperorLinux, Slackware-9.1 or the phase of the moon.

  Still to be achieved: testing my fiancee's laptop for wifi access both
internally and externally and gaining access to the 'Net from my notebook,
too.

  However, progress has been made! Excelsior!

I hope you're savvy enough to figure out how to strip the mysql parts out
of this how-to:

<URL: http://www.marlow.dk/tech/postfix.php >

It's pretty straightforward, just modify the user tables portion of the
smtp-auth configuration.

If you want, I can strip out the relevant bits of the how-to (modified for
no database connection) and repost them here.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0406191505420.1686-100000@gisnet.com>

I'm trying to reconfigure my PHP to work with MySQL, and so I unistalled
the php, php-imap, and php-ldap rpms because I'm planning to recompile php
from source. But one of the configuration settings I need is --with-apxs, 
and I don't see it in /usr/sbin where it's supposed to be.

When I look on the RedHat (8.0) CDs for the apache rpms, I don't see any 
by that name. I think I need the apache-devel rpm for this, but I'm 
surprised there are no apache rpms on the disks. Does RedHat name these 
differently?

Anyway, does anyone know what rpm the apxs program is in, and how I 
extract it without making a total mess of my (currently working) system?

I really don't know, but try looking for httpd packages.

On Debian, apxs is in apache-dev. So look for an httpd-devel package.

Maybe staightforward to some, but not clear to me.  However; with this
clue and Charlie's clue and some googleing I seem to have a setup that
works.  The final clue for working with saslauthd, was to put postfix in
the sasl and mail groups (mail may not be needed).

Bill, if you want to stick with the rpms you should be able to just install 
the php-mysql rpm and be on your merry way. I've always installed php and 
apache with packages and the apxs was "just there".

  Any of you Slackware users using swaret to keep the distribution current
with security upgrades?

  I've read the manual, faq and man pages but I don't think I've properly
set up /etc/swaret.conf or used the proper command. I know that there's a
revised cvs now, and cvs is installed on my workstation, but swaret didn't
upgrade it. I'm wondering if there are secrets I need to learn before I add
this to cron.weekly.

I don't use Slackware, but I do have two items to kibitz on.

Maybe it's not considered a "security upgrade" and that's why it
doesn't update it?

Even for Debian, it is very strongly discouraged that you put actual
upgrades into a cron job. Dry-runs, sure; but never the actual thing:

* The application interface may change, rendering parts of your system
broken (not so much a problem with Debian stable, which always
backports).

* A security compromise upstream would cause mass compromises
downstream.

* If something does go wrong, you're not there to fix it quickly.

* May require additional restarts of support software that's hard to
tell in an automated system.

It may well be you only intended to put in a dry-run or notification
command in your cron script, but I think this all needed to be said
anyways.

This is already on a website: http://server.riverdale.k12.or.us/~danh/

But that isn't strictly *the* website, but it is linked from the main

Shouldn't need to with saslauthd, the point of which is to run as root
so the application using it doesn't need to.

the application does not run as root who said it did?
It needs to run gid sasl to be able to read the /var/run/sasl directory
to find the name of the pipe to talk to.

Rob,

  We know it's a security fix because that was in the notice sent out via
e-mail. As far as I can recall, all Slackware patch notices are security
related.

  Regardless, the command line I used was 'swaret --upgrade -A'. As I
understand the docs, this instructs swaret to upgrade all installed packages
for which there is an available upgrade and do so without asking my
permission for each one. The first time I tried this I learned that the
'update' command had to be run to establish the list of packages (base and
extra) installed. So I did that.

  I used the list of resource sites in /etc/swaret.conf.new, the installed
example file. I tried to find a list of current sites but didn't see any on
the swaret Web site. I can forward a copy of the config file (off the list)
so that those more knowledgeable than I can see if it is correct.

   Oh, I really don't intend to put it in cron.weekly; that was a suggestion
from the docs. The patches that are issued are so infrequent that I can
manually run it whenever I get a notice of something issued.

Thanks,

Rich

Ah; mine don't require a special group because /var/run/saslauthd is
0755.  Back before the advent of saslauthd, Cyrus-SASL 1.5.24 or so, you
had to either run your application as root so it could read /etc/shadow
(for PAM or shadow authmech) or create a special group like 'shadow'
that you put postfix, cyrus, and other application-users into, and
chgrp'd and chmod'd /etc/shadow.  That's what I thought you were having
issues with, because there are still docs that refer to this.

What a freakin' nightmare this has been! I finally realized that RedHat
packages the apache server in rpms named httpd*.rpm and httpd-devel*.rpm.  
So I installed the httpd-devel rpm and whoopee! apxs appeared. Then I
proceeded to compile php 4.3.7. Arg! It blew up saying I needed to upgrade
httpd 2.0.40 to 2.0.44. So, not wishing to trash httpd in a recursive
tangle of dependency upgrades, I tried an older version of php -- the same
as what came with RH 8.0, 4.2.2. That blew up during make with basic C
function parameter mismatch errors. Jeez! So I moved forward and tried php
4.3.1. THAT blew up on the first line during 'make install.' It gasped
out:

line 1: /usr/lib/httpd/build/instdso.sh: No such file or directory

and died. Ai carumba!

Okay, so suppose I try the php-mysql rpm approach. Is this 
version-dependent too, and do I need a version that's not too old, yet not 
too new, but one that's just right? And what happens if I already have 
MySQL installed and running okay? This was compiled from source and so I 
doubt that a new rpm is going to notice it. Will that matter?

Any help at this point would be welcomed. I think I'm way out of my depth 
here, but perhaps I could drown even in a puddle.

I havent been following this thread much, but it seems building a custom RPM set
with everything you need would be the easiest way to get all your stuff
running.
Theres a neat project, called Apache Toolbox. I've been using it for a while,
and for RPM based systems (redhat etc) it has the ability to compile its
binaries, and package them into RPM's for easy installation, and to add itself
to the dependency list.
http://www.apachetoolbox.com/

It works great for non-RPM systems too (slackware), compiles, and install into
very standard directorys, installs shared libraries for mysql/php/phpimap and
so on.

Subject: [PLUG] LPRng, ghostscript, apsfilter, ijs driver....  nothing works
Message-ID: <40D65D49.7070503@brianquade.net>

I have been trying for a week to install a simple print server using 
LPRng, ghostscript, apsfilter, and the hpijs driver.  It is the most 
horrifying Linux experience I have had.  I have no idea how to tell if 
ghostscript supports my driver.  I installed the hpijs driver and 
running gs -h shows a device called ijs, which seems to be the one I 
need.  However, it doesn't show up in the apsfilter SETUP, so I chose 
the driver called ijs/DESKJET_940 (I have an HP904c).  My printcap file 
looks like this:

# APS1_BEGIN:printer1
# - don't delete start label for apsfilter printer1
# - no other printer defines between BEGIN and END LABEL
aps1|ijs/DESKJET_940;r=300x300;q=medium;c=full;p=letter;m=auto:\
    :lp=/dev/lp0:\
    :if=/usr/local/etc/apsfilter/basedir/bin/apsfilter:\
    :sd=/var/spool/lpd/aps1:\
    :lf=/var/spool/lpd/aps1/log:\
    :af=/var/spool/lpd/aps1/acct:\
    :mx#0:\
    :sh:
# APS1_END - don't delete this

Everything looks right to me, having never set all of this up before.  
But when I try to print a test page from SETUP, it tells me that there 
was an unrecoverable error with ghostscript.

I am running Red Hat 9, LPRng 3.8.27, ghostscript 7.07, apsfilter 7.2.5, 
and hpijs 1.6.

Yeah, I couldn't decide if it was one of those auto-forge things that just
assumes the address of the recipient (though I don't know how that'd be
done via a mailing list) or if they were using my address to get through
to the list.

I guess it's the latter.

I'm interpretting your message to mean that it should be totally obvious
that this didn't come from any of my systems.  That'd be the case.

.tr is Turkey. .tk is Tokelau, but is administrated by Paul Vixie.  No big
surprise there.

Following on the heels of a previous post on postfix and tls/sasl.

Trying to get sasl to work.  No TLS working yet (prerequisite?).
Running Debian 3.0 with backports for postfix-tls and sasl2.

Once I reload postifx with this config smtpd fails to deliver mail with
this error in the logs:

Nope.

Sigh.  I somehow doubt that it was someone in Turkey who actually sent 
this.  Probably an infected machine that is used by spammers :-(

I'd guess this is either the "pwcheck_method" or the lack of tls,
hopefully others will chime in.

I have a laptop running Linux and I'd like to hook up an antenna and be
able to watch whatever TV shows are available over the airwaves.  Does
anyone have recomendations for a USB 2.0 TV Tuner that works with Linux?
Thanks,

  Just out of curiosity, is anyone else here using a portable that has the
ethernet port built into the system board? If so, are you also using a WiFi
pcmcia card? Having both built in doesn't count.

  I'm curious to learn if someone has this working and on which
distribution.

Portable, as in a laptop?  Yes, I have a Toshiba Satellite with built-in
Ethernet.  I sometimes use a wireless PCMCIA card with it.  It's running
Fedora Core 1.

Matt,

  Yes, portable as in a laptop/notebook.

  I believe that Fedora uses /sbin/ifup for the interfaces. Is that called
in a hotplug file called "net.agent"?

  My problems with the Sony Vaio PCG-V505BC running Slackware-9.1 is that
the built-in eth0 is always brought up and the default route is glued on
that interface. So, when the pcmcia WiFi card is inserted (and there's no
cat5 cable on the wireline port), both eth0 and eth1 come up, but there's no
route for eth1. I'd like to see how fedora handles this.

Thanks,

Rich

Yep - built-in eth0 since the beginning of time, added a wifi card about a 
year ago.  The built-in worked with Slackware and later Gentoo.  I've only 
ever used the wifi card with Gentoo.  I use the wifi card unless I need to 
move a lot of data or my WAP is on the fritz.

In Fedora, there's a script, /etc/init.d/network, that reads config files
in /etc/sysconfig for setting network parameters.  /etc/sysconfig/network
config file would have global network settings such as the hostname and
usually the default gateway for all interfaces.
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts contains config files for all the network
interfaces on the system.  In these config files there are settings for
the interface name to use, the IP address, netmask, whether the interface
should start automatically at boot, etc.  So in your case if you were
running Fedora all you'd need to do is put the default route for both
interfaces in /etc/sysconfig/network.

It looks like support for these is pretty poor.  I did find this:

http://pvrusb.sourceforge.net/

Which is a driver for the Hauppauge WinTV PVR USB tuner-- not to be
confused with the plain WinTV USB tuner.  The former streams mpeg2 over
the USB line, the latter some wierd internal format.

I have had good experiences with the bttv-based Hauppauge WinTV PCI cards
in the past, but I have no direct experience with the USB version.

  Does gentoo use /sbin/ifup or /sbin/ifconfig to control network
interfaces?

  The folks at EmperorLinux offered a patch to Slackware's /etc/hotplug/net.agent
which is intended to put the route on eth1 if the wifi card is inserted. It
ain't working as intended so I'd like to see the network interface scripts
of a distribution that does work and see if I can extract useful insight for
my system.

Matt,

  I do know the SysV-format for init scripts in Red Hat and Fedora and that
they're different from the BSD-format init scripts in Slackware. I'm trying
to figure out what changes I need to make where to get the desired outcome.

Thanks,

I'm running one on my work laptop (with Windows 2000 - hey, don't
ask....It's a requirement for work!  <sigh>).

It's a Dell Latitude and when I run Linux it's Knoppix v3.3.  I have an
external PCMCIA card (Netgear MA401) that Knoppix detects and configures
when I'm on the road or at home to connect my laptop to my home network.

Is there a specific question you have?

Run 'saslauthd -v' and make sure 'pam' is listed as a compiled-in
mechanism.  However, as Brian pointed out, the 'pwcheck_method' is wrong
and that is likely the cause of error.

There can be only one interface at any one time with the default route.
In your case you'll have to down eth0 (or "route del ..."), bring up eth1,
and then add the default route for eth1.  I'm assuming that you could edit
your net.agent script in Slackware to accomplish the same thing.

Yup.  Mine is a debian install.  The interface configuration is
by-way-of /etc/network/interfaces and eth0 (since I nearly always
connect the laptop by wifi) is not "auto"matically brought up on
boot.  If I want it, I say: "ifup eth0" and up it comes via dhcp.

Before you ask, I have _no_ idea how in particular slackware does
this.

  Unfortunately, it may not be possible to modify net.agent to do this
automagically because it is non-trivial to determine if there's anything
attached to the eth0 port. Your pointer to 'route del ...' is valuable!
Thanks, Matt.

  The parsimonious solution is to do this manually when I want to use the
wifi interface rather than the wired interface. That is, when I'm away from
the office. But, you've given me the idea that I can write a script that
brings down eth0 ('ifconfig eth0 down'), deletes that route, then brings up
eth1 and attaches the route to that interface.

  It doesn't need to be automatic, any more than my connection to a dsl port
in a {h|m}otel. In this situation I su then run 'dhcpcd -d eth0' and away I
go. I'm just as willing to run a script that changes the interface and route
from eth0 to eth1 when the wifi card is in place.

Excelsior!

Well, since the beginning of its time, anyway.  :-)

It uses ifconfig.

If you can run commands manually (ifconfig and route) and things start to 
work, then we can just replace the network scripts with a few manual 
commands.

Life would probably be a lot easier if you installed a DHCP server and used 
DHCP to assign IP addresses.  DHCP just seems to work more frequently than 
static addresses for me lately.  It is very easy to install and configure a 
DHCP server, as well.

I have a friend with a Sony Vaio (from 2000) with a builtin Intel port and
an Orinico Classic Gold card.  He was using Redhat 9.0, last I checked.

But if you insert your Wifi card,  can't we assume we don't care if anything 
is plugged in to eth0 or not?

I think by inserting your wifi card, you're saying "Hey, system, I want to use 
my wireless connection now, so go ahead and start using that instead of eth0" 
aren't you?

  Yup.

  Yup.

  The problem has been that both eth0 and eth1 come up when the wifi card is
plugged in but there's no cable for the wired connection.

  What I just tried was:

  ifconfig eth0 down
  route del eth0
  ifconfig eth1 up # it was already up, but ...
  route add -net 192.168.55.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.55.4 eth1

  The response was:
  SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable.

  Now, this may be unrelated to the algorithm and syntax. Friday evening the
wireless connection to the network died from the other portable when it had
worked perfectly earlier that evening. Nothing shows up as out of order:
lights, route, interface. So, I think I'm temporarily stymied. Perhaps I'll
put the above in a script named 'wifi-up' and try it at a wifi hotspot
sometime soon. Sigh.

Thanks, Rob,

Rich

  Even with 4-5 physical machines? Can't hurt to try, I suppose. There's
never been a problem with wireline connections, even among the portables.
It's only since I've tried to set up a WiFi portion on the LAN that I've run
into this.

On checking if anything is attached "ethtool eth0"
You'll at least know if you got a link.  Well, I know this works with
Intel cards.  Others may vary.

  We have no problems on an IBM ThinkPad 600E, vintage 1999. That has no
built-in ports.

Even with just 4-5 machines.

On my LAN of about nine machines, I've only moved four over to DHCP so far.  
I'm happy I set up the DHCP server, however, because it's made UML tinkering 
easier and when I bring home a box to fix, I just plug it in and it has 'net 
access. no tinkering necessary.

What DHCP would do in your situation is verify the default route is set 
properly when your wifi card comes online...

  Wow! I wasn't aware that this tool existed. Thanks, Mark.
  When I ran it for eth0 it showed everthing about the port, but when I ran
it for eth1 I see there's no data available. Hmmm-m-m.

Thanks,

Wrong kind of UML. dia doesn't much care about any IP addresses.  :-)

User Mode Linux, on the other hand, likes havng an IP address to get out...

Just some thoughts:
iwconfig is helpful for the wireless side of things

DHCP can be set to hand out a static address to certain MAC addresses. 
It's how my laptop is set to deal depending if I'm at a friend's house or
my own.
That way the routing and DNS just happen.

  Thanks, Mark. I should have mentioned earlier in this thread that I
periodically try that. It looks OK but I still cannot reach the network.

  Well, everyone's twisting my arm into setting up dhcpd/dhcpcd. I suppose I
need to read a recent HOWTO (don't know if the mini-HOWTO I have is
sufficiently good) and make a plan.

I've got an IBM R31 with a built-in Intel NIC and a Linksys PCMCIA wireless card.
Its running Debian unstable with both eth0(built-in) and eth1(wireless) set to auto
load and they come up just fine. If I'm booting and going to be connecting via
wireless, I usually hit Ctrl-C instead of waiting for eth0 to time out, but if I 
don't, it will time out and the wireless will come up.

After taking down eth0, the default route for that interface should also
vanish so you don't need to delete the route manually.  After you take
down eth0, Try this:

route add default gw 192.168.55.4

That should bind the default gateway to eth1 if it's the only interface
up.  If that doesn't work then there's a problem with your configuration
of eth1 (wrong netmask, wrong subnet, etc).

What's the output from "ifconfig" and "route -n"?

I don't think so.  If you can't get it working with a static configuration
then I think you'll just be adding an additional level of complexity by
using DHCP and blindly hoping that it solves your problems.

Matt,

  That's what I thought originally, so I must have mis-interpreted what I
read.

  I'm going to try -- after I get some real work done -- to turn on dhcp for
eth1 on the Sony and on the WAP.

Matt,

  They are what they should be.

  I'm going to press the "pause" button for this thread now. I think at
least part of the problem -- if not all of it -- is the WAP. Access to it's
admin funcions via a BUI is intermittent, I can no longer ping it and my
fiancee's machine suddenly stopped communicating with the network in the
middle of writing an e-mail message.

  So, until I can determine if the WAP works I'm not going to try to fix
other problems.

  And, among all of you I know the path to the answer, once the WAP is
reliably on-line: activate dhcpd on the WAP and set eth1 on my portable
(eth0 on my fiancee's) to use dhcpcd. That way there's no IP address
conflict and we make everyone happy.

  In the meantime, I am going to arrange to 1) try my WAP on a known working
network and 2) try a known working WAP on my network.

Thanks,

Rich

Another good one, if you prefer Apache/mod_perl over Zope is
Bricolage, see http://www.bricolage.cc/. 'twas developed for Salon.com
originally, and is used by the likes of the WHO amongst others, if
that stuff impresses you. I hope to be giving a demo on it in a few
months.

I have a simple solution for FC1

I have eth0 as the default.

If I am boot to wireless I waiting until I am in GNOME, then click the
icon I made for wireless which runs '/sbin/ifup wlan0'  I have already
made that interface available to the user (start/stop).

So when I boot at home (wireless) it fails to load eth0 and continues on
happily until I log in.  I then click, and I am wireless.

This is actually more secure since I have to *choose* my network (click
wireless, or click in the network cable).  I do not worry about being on
a network by accident.

When I used pcmcia I just set the wireless card to be default.  If I add
a new default route to a new interface, it *usually* blows out the old
address, especially if both use dhcp.


My beef is why do I need to wait for eth0 to be found.  It delays boot
something like 45 seconds, which can be precious, sitting the airport
retrieving the confirmation code at the kiosk.....

I think the whole boot sequence needs an overhaul.  Servers should not
need a server name from the IP to start, and yes I am thinking of X....

The problem is that you are trying to use the Cell phone Wireless
Application Protocol (WAP) instead of an Access Point (AP).

One is a standard for communication, the other is a thing, which
communicates.

We are bringing a big site up with it.  It is very good at content
inclusion, thought ZWiki needs to use better things then
StructuredText.  I can force it to use old C2 formating, but most other
wikis like phpwikis have extended it quite well.

I thought it was pretty cool when I booted up into Knoppix and it
backgrounded the networking and went on. You might want to dive in 
the code and see how they do that.

Even the best spyware and anti-virus softwares need a bootable distro CD
to completely get rid of Windows.

This reminds me of an (actual) Mozilla error I used to see every once

Subject: [PLUG] Excel macro question
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0406231443060.7010-100000@www.fnordora.org>

I am dealing with a pretty nasty Excel macro from the Mac version of Excel 
4.

I am trying to find something that has macro compatibility in the open 
source world.

Has anyone tried converting macros from Excel from Windows and/or Mac?

Open Office 1.10 for the Mac just converts the macros to ascii garbage.

I need to convert this and port it to something else because OS X and 
Excel 4 for the Mac do not get along to well.  (At least not for this.)

Does anyone have a working example of ldap authentication in Squid?  I 
have been trying to get it to work and have not gotten much success.  
(Which is not at all surprising since there is no documentation to be 
found.)

Eric? Eric? Anyone?

Alan,

  Have you tried OO.o-1.1.2 on linux?

  I have been using XessSE for years and I really like it as a spreadsheet.
I cannot recall any macros in Excel spreadsheets I've imported, but if you
want to send it over I can feed it to XessSE and see if it digests it or
barfs it back up.

Soekris box.  Has the mini-pci a/b/g card in it.  I want to use 802.11a, but using
iwconfig, tells me it is a 802.11g device and printing frequencies out only shows
the 2.4GHz range.  Any trick to switching the card into "A" mode?

Gnumeric tries for Excel macro compatibility, and often succeeds.

Only simple ones.

I started having some troubles with KDE and discovered that my home
partition is out of disk space.  I found a file that was 2.5G and
deleted figuring that was the issue.  But this morning the problem
remains.  "df" tells me that I have  3045736 bytes used but "du
--max-depth=1" tells me my entire home directory is only 6.0M.  A
"find . -size +1000 -print" only reveals two files that are barely
over 1M.  I'm using reiserfs.  Could there be another problem of some
sort?

Yes, I did it and found it pretty straight-forward.  I created a special
LDAP object that the authentication program could bind as, in able to be
able to search, called 'uid=squid,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com' (this is
actually just a regular posixAccount for the squid user).  Then I added
an entry like this to squid.conf:

authenticate_program /usr/lib/squid/squid_ldap_auth -b dc=example,dc=com
-D uid=squid,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com -w PASSWORD -f uid=%s ldaphost

And then an ACL like this:

acl localnet proxy_auth REQUIRED

Note that I'm using a slightly older version of Squid (2.4-STABLE6); I
think the newer versions have a slightly different way of configuring
the authentication.

Does anyone know of a mirror/archive site that still has Redhat distributions
and updates for versions 7.3 and lower?  It appears that Redhat has moved
or removed these from their site, and consequently all of the mirrors
have done the same.

thanks,

I used dogpile to do an advanced search, using the exact phrase "Red Hat
version 7.3", and any of the words distribution, archive, mirror, or
download. Google found this:

Do you know if a particular process was writing to that 2.5G file?
Perhaps the OS still thinks the file is open...

Did you delete the file or is it sitting in trash?

Check if you need to empty your trash.

If it is, "lsof" should give you an idea what process still has it open.

Thanks for the offer.  I finally found what I needed (mutt) by using
rpm.pbone.net.  After searching, downloading, and installing, I realized
I could have just used yum.  Doh!

Its the Fedora Legacy Project, a community project that still has support

Turned out that this link wasn't very useful after all. (I actually
tried the links there, and found most were broken, or you needed an

A file is not actually deleted until all programs that have the file open get
around to closing it. The reboot forced the app to close the file. That
freed up the associated disk space. Another way to do this is to kill the 
process that is holding the file open.

That happened to be KDE.  Running initlevel 5 would have made it 
diffucult.  He would have had to log out instead of rebooting.

yellow edges.  This shows up in screenshots when zoomed in so it looks
intentional.  Each character is consistent in how it looks-- i.e. each "r"
is blue to the right, and each "l" is yellow to the right.

It's most noticable in the KDE terminal.

I've tried adjusting and disabling antialising, but the problem didn't
change.  Has anyone else seen this?  Was there an easy fix?

Thanks,

  -- Steve

What color depth?  What video chipset?  What brand of laptop?

Another old-school UNIX admin trick is to "cp /dev/null .kde-errors".
This frees the file's space even if a process has it open.

Sometimes the size in "ls" will immediately jump back to its former value
but "df"  should show the space still freed.  (I.e. the application just
re-seeked to what it thought was the end of the file and started writing,
creating a sparse file.)

All color depths, 8, 16, and 24.

ATI Radeon, using the stock XFree86 server installed by the above distros.
This doesn't appear to be a problem with the X server itself or the
display.

Compaq Evo N1020v, runs at 1024x768.

I gather from the questions that you have not seen the problem before.

				 PRESENTATION

	      Greylisting and a Look at the Anti-Spam Landscape

				      by

				 Hal Pomeranz
			      <hal at deer-run.com>


       Black lists (both automated and not), white lists,
       keyword/regexp/Bayesian filters, SPF, and now "greylisting"-- where
       will the continuing anti-spam arms race take us next?  This talk
       includes an overview of current anti-spam techniques with some
       thoughts on their relative pros and cons, and a more in-depth look at
       the recently available "greylisting" technique, which is proving
       amazingly effective at blocking certain classes of spam.
    
       Hal Pomeranz is the technical lead and official spam eradicator for
       Deer Run Associates, a small consulting firm (recently relocated to
       Eugene, OR).  But this is merely his "mild-mannered secret identity"
       that hides his exploits as a Faculty Member and Senior Unix Instructor
       for the SANS Institute, Technical Advisor for the Center for Internet
       Security, and Technical Editor for Sys Admin Magazine.

there is also the whole proof of concept. these can be fun to write and test 
to see if your idea will work. it's the people that actually release them 
that are screwed up.

My take on this is that some software companies which develop anti-virus
software might hire outside programmers to write new viruses.
Have you noticed that as soon as a new virus appears, the antidot is on 
the market already. Otherwise how they would stay in business?
Actually, M$ virus prone OS gives jobs for many folks :)

Subject: [PLUG] Resetting hostname and IP address
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0406250902510.31446@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  My WiFi access point problems were confirmed to be a bad WAP. Linksys sent
the replacement and I need to access the admin page to configure it.
However, I cannot connect to 192.168.1.1 from my notebook when its IP
address is on a different subnet (192.168.55.3).

  I thought I knew how to (temporarily) change the static IP address and
hostname on my notebook. Apparently I don't. First, I tried 'hostname' to
set a new name for the unit, then I added the hostname and IP address to
/etc/hosts and /etc/hosts.equiv. But, when I rebooted the hostname and IP
address had not changed.

  All I want to do is access the WAP to change its IP address and set up
some security. Please pass me a pointer to what I've missed here. (This is
another example of memory leak that happens when one is not a full time
network admin.)

Thanks,

Rich

That keeps being brought up, but not close to the truth at all.  A lot of
the proof of concept virus writers do send their works to AV companies. 
The AV companies also check news groups, etc... for viruses being
released.
Do they hype the threat, yes.  But do they support people to write them, no.

  Highly cynical but an idea that has been expressed before. Given what
we've seen about those who exploit patent pools and try to extort money by
threatening IP litigation against those who cannot affort big legal battles
I would not be surprised to find truth in what you write, Alex.

You don't have to alter you system name, just its IP address.
Use ifconfig (InterFace Config) to set a new IP address for the Ethernet
interface.

Try fiddling around with your Anti-Aliasing settings.  They should be in
the KDE Control Center under "Appearance & Themes" -> "Fonts". You'll
want to take a look at the "Use sub-pixel hinting".  You can either
disable it entirely (I *think* it's disabled by default, however) or try
changing the sub-pixel ordering.  RGB is the most common, but one of the
others may work better for you.

Subject: [PLUG] Lightweight SMTP relay
Message-ID: <1088182828.16567.10.camel@timmy>

Due to a variety of circumstances, I need to forward mail through my
machine from one place to one other place. It works like this:

My Real Mail Server <- SMTP -> This Relay 
<- SMTP -> ISP Relay <- SMTP -> Final destination

Because the box at "This Relay" is very low on memory, I am looking for
a piece of software that will do this with less than 1MB of memory
usage. The volume of mail is very, very low, so running through inetd
would probably be the best way to do it.

Google turns up nothing but Windows spamming software, at least with the
searches I have tried. What is out there that will do this job?

Thanks,
Evan

chaz,

  D'oh! Of course. As I wrote, things like this slip from my memory because
I need the information so rarely.

Many thanks,

Chaz,

  OK. Got part way when I got bogged down again.

  1) Ran 'ifconfig eth0 192.169.1.2'. 'ifconfig -a' shows eth0 up and
running with this IP address.

  2) Ran 'route add -net 0.0.0.0 gw 192.168.1.1 eth0'. 'netstat -rn' shows
the destination 192.168.1.0 on eth0 and gateway 192.168.1.1 (the WAP) also
on eth0.

  However, when I try to access the WAP the connection is refused (in
mozilla). I tried it using 'links' and learned that there is no route to the
host. Hmm-m-m. That's what I thought I set up.

  Again I've mislaid an important piece of information. What is it this
time?

Thanks,

Rich

I'm not sure how little memory you have, but I run Postfix on my
firewall with only 48MB.  It uses about 3MB.

Above, you have 192.169.1.2. Is that just a typo in your email, and you
did in fact have 192.168.1.2?
                     ^^^

I'd like to see your output from "netstat -rn" and "ifconfig -a". We
might be able to spot something there.

One other possiblility - do you have your browsers set up to use a proxy
server?

  Oops! Forgot this one. On the notebook, no. On workstations, yes. I was
able to access the WAP from the workstations after the IP address had been
changed to the local subnet.

That all looks correct, although the transmit errors might be the
problem. How are your laptop and access point physically connected to
each other? Through a hub/switch, directly cabled, etc? Does the
interface on the AP act like a switchport or an end device?

You should be able to reach a different subnet by setting up a virtual
interface.  My main machine uses 192.168.1.128, and I needed to access a
device that defaulted to 192.168.0.1.  Here's the command I used to
allow me to connect to the 192.168.0.0 network.  Note that this
automatically sets up the appropriate route, at least on my machine
(Redhat 9 with kernel 2.4.22).

 /sbin/ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.0.128 netmask 255.255.255.0

After executing this command, I had two IP's associated with my eth0
device, the original 192.168.1.128, and the new 192.168.0.128.  I was
then able to point my browser at 192.168.0.1 and access its config page.

Stafford,

  A cat5 patch cord. The WAP is a hub (or switch, I forget which) and I have
the cable plugged into one of the ports (#3, to be exact). When the prior
onw was working, it didn't matter into which port the patch cable from the
wireline switch went.

Thanks,

Rich

galen,

  Excellent knowledge that will certainly be useful one day. Unfortunately,
that's not today. Still see "no route to host" because the network right now
is just my notebook and the WAP. But, ...

  Rats! I just hooked the WAP to the wired network and the notebook to its
normal cable. 'ping' responds "Destination Host Unreachable". 'links' shows:
	Error loading http://192.169.1.1:
	No route to host.

  It must be me because this should not be such a major production.

Thanks,

Rich

Please post the command you used to set up the virtual interface, as well
as the output from ifconfig and route after the virtual interface was
set up..

Rich,
There is no need to worry about setting up a gateway in the route table
since the 2 systems are on the same subnet.
Al that should be required is that the interface be set to a compatible IP
address.
This looks like it has been done below.
The default (0.0.0.0) gateway you put in shouldn't cause a problem though.
Are you sure about the IP address of the WiFi device?

chaz,

  I am no longer sure of anything germane to setting up the WiFi portion of
my network. But, 192.169.1.1 is what the Linksys defines as the default IP
address for the WAP. And, first thing this morning, I pressed the reset
button on the rear of the unit.

  FWIW, the Linksys tech support is in India. At least, the woman who
answered had a very strong Indian accent. Perhaps she was in Tuscaloosa.

I am about to give up on these tablets.  They are being much more
difficult than I have time for currently.

I got a power supply and both of the units came up OK and the
batteries recharged fine.  I got new AAAA batteries and both pens
work. 

But I cannot get either unit to recognize a CF/ATA card as an ATA
disk.  They sit at the "Autodetecting ATA disk" for a number of
seconds and then say no disk found.

And I have only been able to make a couple of CF cards into Linux
disks.  My Mandrake laptop goes into a continuous error message and
won't let me access the card.  I finally got one to work on my old,
old NEC laptop running Slackware.  But two of the CF cards I have give
no errors when I partition them using cfdisk and then do 'mkef2fs
/dev/hdc1', but they still are seen as vfat disks in 'df -T' and ls
complains that there is no .. directory and lost+found shows as
lost+fou.nd.  [No great loss, they still work fine in my camera.]  The
other card formats OK, shows as a Linux disk, but is not recognized by
the tablet.

Any spare clues out there or should I just give up?

Is that a typo?  192.169?  before you said 192.168.
Is this device a part of any service that you get via an ISP?  If so they
may have changed the address and stored it.
Usually, a device like this has a specific procedure that you have to go
through to get it to revert back to the factory defaults.  Usually a reset
button just causes an internal reboot.

I have noticed that some CF type media will not format as anything other 
than vfat.  It seems to be something in how the media was made.  Some usb 
drives do this.  Some flash memory does as well.  Probably the same OEM.

Have you tried a different brand?

Is there a reason you cannot use vfat?

  Yes, it's a typo. Spelling check didn't pick it up.

  No. The WAP is sitting on the shelf here, right on top of the wireline
switch.

  It came as a warrantee replacement. Almost certain a referb unit with the
box marked, "Factory QA Standards". If someone there set it for a different
IP address I have no idea what it is.

If it might somehow have a different address, you could try to sniff
traffic coming from it.

tcpdump -v -i eth0 not net 192.168.150.0/24

Rich,
I have not used virtual addresses on a given interface that were for
different subnets.  I would at least try setting eth0 to a 192.168.1 address
to keep things simple.

I have had replacement units arrive with non-default addresses (cisco
routers, etc).
The manual should have a procedure for forcing it to reload the factory
defaults.

Stafford is correct that you could try sniffing for any traffic it sends
out.
You probably will have to kick it with a power cycle or reset to get it to
send out an initial broadcast or something.

Everything you posted looks good to me.  

I agree with the others.  I think you need to find out how to reset the
unit to the factory defaults.

  Hokay, here's the poop. According to the fold up page that came with the
unit, the host attempting to connect to the WAP should have an IP address of
"192.168.1.xxx where xxx is greater than 100". (Checked for typos: OK) If
that does not permit access to the router's admin page, then the reset
button must be held down for at least 35 seconds (!) to restore factory
defaults. So, ...

  I held down the reset button for 35 seconds. Then I rebooted the laptop,
gave it a second IP address of 192.168.1.150 (Typo checks ... OK) and tried
to access the admin page using mozilla. Message box pops up, "Connection
refused when trying to access 192.168.1.1".

  At which point I realize that I'm drowning in everything being properly
set up but it just ain't workin'. Sigh. I'll try calling tech support again.
Then I _must_ get back to my day job.

Thanks,

Rich

No, I was trying what I had on hand.  The one that I can format as

I am trying to put Linux on it.  I cannot imagine Linux working
directly on a vfat: no links, no permissions, etc. [Wait a minute, I
suppose I might try Slackware's zipslack.  I would have to put DOS on
the CF, but that might work.  I'd rather run a regular Linux if I
can, though.]

There is an extention that will allow Linux to work directly on a DOS 
partition.  (Written a *long* time ago when such things were done.) It 
does not seem to exist in the 2.6 kernels, but it may not be needed any 
more.

So we now know how to reset to factory defaults.  It's usually something
like this business of holding down the reset button for an extended period.
It means that you have to have physical access to the unit and you can't
inadvertently perform this function.

Also we know what IP address range to use (> 100).

This is real progress.

Just thought of another possible gotcha:
Do you have a DHCP server running?
It's becoming more and more common for a piece of equipment to try to
contact a DHCP server for an IP address as a part of its default behavior.

Also, did you try giving eth0 a single IP address of 192.168.1.150?
Depending on the vagaries of distribution that might be an issue.

chaz,

  The 'extended period' is 30 seconds; I held it down for 35 seconds.

> Just thought of another possible gotcha:
> Do you have a DHCP server running?

  No. According to Linksys tech support the server default is to come up in
dhcp server mode rather than with a static IP address.

  However, the admin functions of this WAP/router are initially set at
192.168.1.1. That's what we found with the soon-to-be-defective unit at the
May clinic. Then we changed the static IP address to something on my subnet
here.

> Also, did you try giving eth0 a single IP address of 192.168.1.150?
> Depending on the vagaries of distribution that might be an issue.

  Single, no. I can't get a default route when I do that. I can redefine the
IP address of my notebook from 192.168.55.3 to 192.168.1.150, but then
there's no route to the WAP.

  Checkmate. I've tried moving but I'm blocked in a corner. :-(

Subject: [PLUG] Securing a Wireless Access point...
Message-ID: <40DC97D2.4030009@robinson-west.com>

The ap box is on two private networks.  I still want to tightly control 
access to it from
wireless hosts since I host my Internet email on the ap box.

I'm only interested in ssh access from wireless hosts.  Maybe later, 
I'll add a backup
service.  I don't know how to turn WEP on, so I'm especially 
disinterested in allowing
imap and other services from my wireless net to my existing private 
subnet.  WEP
doesn't work well, but at least it's something.

So far, I've blocked tcp access to ports 7100 and 515 for the wireless 
net, but I'm sure
there are other ports that need to be blocked.  I've been going by 
nmap's output.  Does
anyone know what the minimum open port requirements are for an ap to 
function?

I figure that the wireless network will be useful for learning and I 
want to be able to
quickly set up local wireless nets for fun too.  It would be safer to 
set up another
machine, but I'm probably going to use an extra box I have for a second 
wireless
hot point instead.  A challenge I'll likely run into is turning two 
wireless lans into a
single larger lan across an untrusted network that they both share.

One thought I've had is to add another nic to the mail server and run a 
dedicated
line to the second ap.  I should be able to run two isolated nets across 
the same box.  
I'm using Redhat 7.3 on the mail machine.  What do the iptables rules 
ned to be for
a router supporting two networks that aren't allowed to exchange 
packets?  I  want
to bridge the two wireless access points together.  Short of hooking the 
two ap boxes
up to each other directly, I figure I have to tunnel through my existing 
net.

chaz, Galen, Kurt and all lurkers:

  Eureka! The key is to unplug the unit after resetting it, then powering it
back up. The Linksys techie tried telling me that's on the sheet, but it
isn't. However, when I unplugged it and repowered it, lights flashed and I
could both ping 192,168.1.1 from the notebook _and_ mozilla finds the admin
page just fine. Whew! What a bloody ordeal this has been.

  The techie asked what versions of winduhs we're running. When I told him
we don't do junk OSes but run only linux he was non-plussed. I guess their
protocol is to have the user reboot the host next. Anyway, for future
generations, it takes both a reset (holding the button for more than 30
seconds) and a power cycle to allow access from a host with an IP address of
192.168.1.100 or greater.

  Thanks, all! Excelsior!

I'd try ping as well as your browser.  Also, is it possible that you
have some type of firewall rules set up that would prevent you from
talking on a different subnet?

I would appreciate it if you would post the brand names.  I'm working on
a project where the filesystem will be in CF.  I'd like to avoid this
problem by purchasing a known-to-work brand.

Great news Rich.
I feel a little dumb for not thinking of the power-cycle step.  I've seen
that before.
Hopefully you're now off and running.  (we hear the strains of "born free"

Just curious, did the virtual interface method work for you, or did you 
reconfigure your primary IP?

Stafford,

  Celebration premature. Microbrew put back in cooler. As soon as I entered
the new IP address and tried to save the settings it once again became
unreachable.

  I reset it and it's sitting there unplugged for now. I also sent Linksys
tech support an e-mail. I've had it with these units. Can't believe that I
have the same problems with two in a row.

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

I've had experience with this.......In my case, once I changed the IP
address in the Wireless router, I lost connectivity because the IP Address
changed.....

I just simply rebooted the Wireless node and pinged it from my normal IP
Address and it worked....

  It's been a _very_ long day. The IP address _was_ changed. I can ping and
access it via opera from the workstation. Need to reboot the notebook. Oy!
What confusion. The message on the browser when I went to save the new IP
address said it should be used the next time I log in. The NPU missed that
it had been changed and now the subnets didn't match.

  I'll be quiet now.

I'm using Qmail together with Gerritt Pape's GPL replacements for
daemontools. The daemons listening to the port run 150K resident. Each
incoming connection takes 300K, approx. The maintenance and delivery
daemons take about 400K resident, and around 500K per delivery. The
number of simultaneous connections you'll accept or attempt can be
tightly controlled to accomodate your system power. (One reason to not
use plain inetd.)

Hope this helps.

Can SanDisk products be purchased at a local retail outlet, or do I
need to place an order?  Are there different types of CF cards, or
will a card from a camera work just as well for a linux filesystem?

While I'm asking CF questions, do you know if CF cards perform any sort
of wear leveling?

thanks,
galen

I've bought them at BestBuy.  They're just regular camera cards, but the
SanDisk have better boot capabilities.  I've made Ext2 filesystems on
them.

No, I think that's generally done as part of the filesystem, like with
JFFS/JFFS2.  Unfortunately, JFFS seems to require special capabilities
of the flash storage and CF doesn't support it; only MTD do.

It exists.  You have to compile it in.  (It is *rarely* available by 
default.  probably why it is not in the 2.6 kernel.)

I decided to look this up on SanDisk's site.  Here's a quote, but
don't ask me to explain what it means.  This is the only occurence 
of the word 'pooling' in the CF spec.

"Wear Leveling is an intrinsic part of the Erase Pooling functionality
of SanDisk CF using NAND memory. The CF WEAR LEVEL command is supported
as a NOP operation to maintain backward compatibility with existing
software utilities."

in traffic and laughs at you is another one of this legion of assholes,
as are the folks that support bombing Iraq, not for some functional
reason, but because it "teaches those ragheads a lesson".  A large
percentage of our fellow planetary residents are looking for some
ideological excuse (An "asshole license" to act like bastards,
because somehow by tormenting others it makes their own wasted lives
marginally better.

It is better to channel that frustration into attacking problems,
not people.  Neither approach changes the world a lot, an neither
approach makes you absolute ruler.  But over time, the latter 
approach leads to less soul rot, and makes for more friends.

So, if you want to point out problems in technology, develop better
technology.  That was the point in the first place, right?

Good idea.  It would be nice if there were a place to keep this info.
[Maybe there is and I just haven't found it.]

The one I could format as an ext2 system was a 32MB from "Simple
Technology".  The one I absolutely could not format as ext2 was a "POI
FlashCard" which is what they sell at Fry's; it remained a vfat. The
third is a 128MB SanDisk, which worked once, then didn't; it failed
whenever I saw a message in the log that said "hdc: hdc: lost
interrupt", so I may have a flaky unit there.

Hoping to avoid the source (code) I'll ask if anyone knows off the top of
their head from where ifconfig pulls the information it displays.

I'd like to do a similar type of reporting (not change) but doing greps,
cuts, trs, and friends makes it a little too cumbersome.  Something
similar to lsusb, lspci and lsmod comes to mind.
   There is also the issue of interface display length.  Off the top of my 
head and based on discussions on the vserver list the interface name can 
be upto 15 characters long.  Ifconfig truncates it at nine with one of 
those being the colon.

I just ordered two SanDisk 256 MB CF cards from Newegg.  One is
conventional, and the other is the new and improved 'Ultra II' version. 
I'll try to let you know about how well they work.

I've used them in Soekris systems and they've worked okay for me.  Those
Stylistics though, they might be a different kind of beast.  PTP used
one for a while for the Pioneer Sq Node, but they used a PCMCIA hard
drive.

I think that assessment is the closest to the truth. There are plenty of
really cool, productive software projects the unemploy[ed|able] could be

I have a couple extras, but I don't have power supplies or styluses. If you
want, ask, but you're gonna have to put money into them to get them working.

As it stands, I'm probably going to rip out the backlights from 10 or so and
use them as low intensity lighting, so if you have any real use for them
I'll be more than happy to give them away.

Pretty much the same story here. I took about eight of them, some extra
batteries, and two kinds of mounts. Only one has the stylus. I doubt if
I'll spend the money to make them useful, so they're for the asking.

They're pretty old--i486s.  They were kind of a pre-cursor to the
"Tablet PC".  You can run Linux on them, but they probably wouldn't be
much use to take notes on.

Well, I for one am sorry to hear that yet another person knows nothing
about the good that's happening in Iraq.  Like many wars, noone can show
beyond a shadow of a doubt that we should have waited for a while let
alone indefinitely.  Go ahead though, be an expert on why we are wrong
doing what we're doing.  All kinds of foreigners are dying in Iraq now,
not just American and British soldiers and civilians.  I highly doubt that
the Korean who died along with Italians and other foreign nationals was
an, ah forget it.

As far as Oil goes, there isn't enough left to supply world demand for much
longer.  It's becoming a non issue.  Besides this, there are far larger 
reserves
 in Saudia Arabia and Africa compared to the supply in Iraq.  I'm more
concerned about an auto industry and public obsessed with inefficient, over
powered, vehicles than whether or not Bush and Cheney are shortsighted.  
After all, don't we all have the H2 civilian Hummer ad memorized?  I'm
waiting for the tank myself, that whole right to bear arms thing ;-)

We should fix a culture bent on wasteful consumption of gasoline and
other petroleum based products.  The biggest problem in this country is
"gotta have more."  We are close to trading quality of life for
that more.  For those who don't believe in God though, it's hardly
surprising to me when they adopt radical materialism and radical
humanism.

The war comment was cheap.  Am I to believe that there are no
wars that aren't carried out by assholes in your mind!  Don't say
that too close to any WWII vets!

Isn't this a matter of perspective? Ungodly for a /home partition may be
a days work for a well used swap partition, and can /var be classified
as ungodly, or just a years worth of work?

While I don't want to start a completely off topic discussion about
the merits or demerits about the bombing of Iraq, I do think it is
on topic that Michael Robinson learn how to read, and how to control
himself, before he posts his off-topic political stuff to this group. 

It is true that I wrote a sentence that is hard to interpret for some
one with poor reading skills, whose head is filled with suspicion, fear,
and a raging desire to correct others.  Michael Robinson, you are almost
the exemplar of the kind of asshole I am talking about.  You should see
a therapist - you are a danger to yourself and others.  And you should
re-read that sentence.

I will discuss this further in plug-talk, where such things belong. 
Please re-join this discussion there.

Subject: [PLUG] Request For Comments on Email Services Install
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0406260945270.16423@well.com>

Folks:

I have come up with a detailed procedure to install an entire
email infrastructure server from a bare bones knoppix load.

This procedure, I hope, would be a sort of 'email services install
and configuration for dummies'.

This facility includes postfix MTA (with tls and authentication);
Courier IMAP (with both imap and pop tls as well as plain); LDAP
for authentication as well as the virtual mailbox resoluter; and
the OpenGroupware calendaring.

This is slated to be a fully sealed server with the email and
calendar users not having regular unix accounts on the box.

I would like to get any comments or criticism that you might have
on this procedure (where did I fell short; are there any gross
omission)

In return, please feel free to use this or dissiminate at your
pleasure.

Subject: [PLUG] Request for criticism for email infrastructure install procedure
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0406260950420.24157@well.com>

Folks;

For the collab project at freegeek, I have come up with a sort
of 'email infrastructure install for dummies' for a postfix
virtual email services including postfix, courier imap, ldap,
and OpenGroupware.

I am looking for any critcism or reminders of any glaring omissions.

In return, please feel free to use this or disiminate at your pleasure.

Thanks

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This procedure assumes that you are planning to set up a sealed,
server for your email and calendaring infrastructure needs.

This server is intended to provide email SMTP transport (via
postfix); IMAP/POP3 email access (via courier imapd); calendaring
(via OpenGroupware) and authentication (via ldap). This will be
structured so that email and calendar account users need not
have entries in the local system account files (/etc/passwd and
/etc/shadow).

A sealed server is a server where the email and calendar account
holders (users) do not have accounts on the machine itself and that
this machine is not someone's workstation or desktop unit; ie; that it
is secured in a server room or locked cabinet away from normal users'
physical access. All access to this server from the users is via WEB
or using clients such as evolution or outlook. Telnet, rsh, and ftp
are disabled. SSH is enabled for the system admins only.

For this installation, we are going to presume that the DHCP service
for diskless workstations (LTSP services) will be handled by another
system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Our baseline (starting point) is having a Knoppix 3.4 CD and a computer
on which to install it. The computer should have at least one NIC, 100 MB
of RAM, and 3 GB of disk space. Of course, the disk space requirements
vary according to how many email users you will handle with the system and
how much space each user will take up in email messages.

------------------------------------------------------------------

The first steps are to install the basic operating system and then
update it from the distribution and to do some very preliminary
system wide configuration:

First, do the Knoppix install, following instructions on the knoppix
installer. For the type of installation, you need to select Debian.

Once the Knoppix is installed, please do the following:

1. Configure the network connection information. Because this
   will be a mail / calendering server, you will need to have
   a fixed IP address as well as a DNS served domain name.
   The appropriate files to edit to configure networking are:

   a. /etc/network/interfaces
   b. /etc/hosts
   c. /etc/resolv.conf
   d. /etc/hostname

   Once you have configured the networking information, you
   will need to re-boot the machine to ensure that the networking
   has started up properly and that you can reach hosts on the
   internet from the machine.

2. Edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file and comment out entries
   associated with the experimental release. They are toward the
   end of the file.

   Add the following to the end of the /etc/apt/sources.list file:

   deb http://www.opengroupware.org/packages deb/

3. Do a dpkg -P nis (which removes the nis package)

4. Do a dpkg -P cpuburn (which removes the cpuburn package)

5. Do an apt-get update to update the package indexes

6. Do an apt-get upgrade - this will take a few hours

7. Do an apt-get dist-upgrade

8. Re-boot the system.

9. Edit the /etc/inittab file and set the default run level
   to 3, which is done by ensuring that the default runlevel
   entry looks something like: id:3:initdefault:

10. Carefuly check the /etc/rc3.d directory. Note that the
   files in that directory are symbolic links to files in
   the /etc/init.d directory and are used to start services
   that are needed for init run level 3 which is what we
   are running this server. At this point, before you have
   installed anything else, you need to ensure that you
   have the link to start up apache and ssh. On some distros,
   the link for ssh will be missing. Also, ensure that there
   are no links for xdm or kdm as those are the x window
   that you will not be using for this server. You will also
   need to add the link to start the mysql server, which is
   allready installed in a Knoppix basic install. If this system
   is to be only a mail/calendar/imap server and not to be
   a dhcp server,  you will also need to remove any symbolic
   links to dhcp; most likely this will be S20dhcp3-server.

11. Re-boot the system at this time and ensure that you have
    the basic services needed running and nothing else. Do
    a 'ps -ef' and ensure that the apache, ssh, and mysql
    are running.

12. Create a user account for the system administrator if this
    is not allready done via the Knoppix installation. This will
    allow the system administrator to log into the system via
    ssh from their workstation.

--------------------------------------------------------------

At this time, the basic system set up is completed. Now we will
do the installation of the software packages. Some of them will
require configuration during the instalation process. Most of the
configuration tasks, however, will take place after all of the
software package instalation is complete.

Here are the steps for the software package instalation:

----------
For LDAP:
-----------

apt-get install libldap2/testing  (this will downgrade the ldap
                                   libraries from unstable to testing
                                   which is necessary to install the
                                   rest of the ldap components)

apt-get install libapache-auth-ldap
apt-get install ldap-utils
apt-get install libldap2
apt-get install libldap2-dev
apt-get install libslapd2-dev
apt-get install libpam-ldap
apt-get install slapd
apt-get install ldap-utils
apt-get install apache-dev/unstable
  (testing may not work for this install)

At some point during the install, you will be asked some questions.
Here is suggested way to respond. You might vary this according to
the situation that you are in. You will need to write down amd remember
your responses to these questions as they will apply to setting up
other packages.

Slapd will ask for a domainname. This is the domain name for your
  organization. For this example we will use freegeek.org

Slapd will ask for Organization name. Here, you can use Free Geek
Slapd will ask for the admin password. You can use secret or whatever you
  want. Please remember this for later.
Answer no to allowing ldapv2 unless you realy need it, which you wont
  in a typical new installation


-----------------------
Postgres Database Server
-----------------------

apt-get install postgresql

This will install the postgres database. You will be prompted for
some configuration stuff. Here is how you should respond (may vary
slightly)

a. Keep the directory as the default (/var/lib/postgres/data)
b. Leave default (no) to the purge question (you have no database now)
c. Select SQL_Ascii for the charactor encoding
d. Use the default (ISO) for the date style
e. Use the US Style for the date format. Be aware that this does default
   to European. You will need to set this.
f. Leave as default (yes) for the automatic upgrades
g. Leave as default (/var/lib/postgres) for the dump file directory
   question; where to leave a dump file during upgrades.
h. Leave as default (/var/lib/postgres/preserve) for the question regarding
   where to copy the existing database during an upgrade

/etc/init.d/postgresql start

and then again do:

apt-get install postgresql

At this time, the install should go through okey. You should not have
to re-enter the configuration options as you had earlier.

Now re-boot the machine and ensure that slapd (the ldap server)
and postgresql are running.


---------------------
Perl Interpretor
---------------------

Do the following to check to see what perl packages you have:

dpkg -l | grep perl

You should see the following on a system with all of the required
packages:

ii  libdate-manip- 5.42a-2        a perl library for manipulating dates
ii  libdbd-pg-perl 1.32-1         a PostgreSQL interface for Perl 5 using DBI
ii  libdbi-perl    1.41-1         The Perl5 Database Interface by Tim Bunce
ii  libft-perl     1.2-13.1       Perl module for the FreeType library

ii  libnet-perl    1.18-2         Implementation of Internet protocols for Per
ii  libperl5.8     5.8.4-2        Shared Perl library.
ii  libpg-perl     2.0.2-3        Perl modules for PostgreSQL
ii  libplrpc-perl  0.2017-1       Perl extensions for writing PlRPC servers an
ii  libsdl-perl    1.20.0-13      SDL bindings for the Perl language
ii  liburi-perl    1.30-1         Manipulates and accesses URI strings
ii  libweakref-per 0.01-4         perl module to create weak references
ii  libwww-perl    5.76-2         WWW client/server library for Perl (aka LWP)
ii  perl           5.8.4-2        Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report
ii  perl-base      5.8.4-2        The Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister.
rc  perl-doc       5.8.3-3        Perl documentation.
ii  perl-modules   5.8.4-2        Core Perl modules.

Most likely you will be missing some of the packages. On the system that
I had be working with, I had to do the following:

apt-get install libdbd-pg-perl
apt-get install libpg-perl


------------------------
PHP Interpreter
------------------------

Do the following to check to see what php packages you have:

dpkg -l | grep php

You should see the following on a system with all of the required
packages:

ii  libphp-adodb   4.21-1         The 'adodb' database abstraction layer for p
ii  libphp-jpgraph 1.5.2-5        Object oriented graph library for php4
ii  php4           4.3.4-4        A server-side, HTML-embedded scripting langu
ii  php4-cgi       4.3.4-4        A server-side, HTML-embedded scripting langu
ii  php4-gd2       4.3.2+rc3-2    GD module (with GD2) for php4
ii  php4-imap      4.3.4-4        IMAP module for php4
ii  php4-ldap      4.3.4-4        LDAP module for php4
ii  php4-mysql     4.3.4-4        MySQL module for php4
ii  php4-pecl-ps   1.1.0-2        An extension to create PostScript files
ii  php4-pgsql     4.3.3-2        PostgreSQL module for php4
ii  phpldapadmin   0.9.4-6        Web based interface for administering LDAP
ii  phpmyadmin     2.5.6-2        A set of PHP-scripts to administrate MySQL o
ii  phppgadmin     3.3.1-2        Set of PHP scripts to administrate PostgreSQ

Most likely, in order to complete the list above, you will need to:

apt-get install php4-cgi
apt-get install php4-gd2
apt-get install php4-imap
apt-get install php4-pecl-ps
apt-get install php4-pgsql
apt-get install phpmyadmin
apt-get install phppgadmin
apt-get install phpldapadmin
apt-get install libphp-adodb
apt-get install libphp-jpgraph

Here is how to answer questions that are asked during the installs
of the php stuff:

1. Default (no) to libc-client use of unencrypted passwords
2. Default (yes) to install libc-client without Maildir support
3. Phpmyadmin asks which webserver to configure. De-select apache2
   and apache-perl
4. Default (no) for re-starting apache
5. Phppgadmin asks which webserver to configure. Select apache.
6. Phpldapadmin asks for whether you want session, cookie, or config
   for password handling. For best security, select session, which
   is the default.
7. Phpldapadmin asks which webserver to configure. Use only apache

8. Select no for re-starting apache.


-------------------------------------------
Postfix Email MTA & Courier IMAP/POP Server
-------------------------------------------

Do:

apt-get install postfix

This will ask you some configuration stuff:

You will need to know what type of site you are. For example, lets assume that
this system will be the primary email mta and imap server for the organization.

Select Internet site for general configuration (the default).

Insert full qualified domain name for mail name
(server.freegeek.org, freegeek.org, whatever)

Answer no to the append domain question

Leave default the comma list of domains for receiving mail

Leave default (no) for forcing synchronization

Leave default (NONE) for root mail alias

Once this is done, then do:

apt-get install postfix-dev
apt-get install postfix-ldap
apt-get install postfix-tls
apt-get install courier-imap
apt-get install courier-imap-ssl
apt-get install metamail

Note that this will generate a key. We will be replacing this key
later as it is only a sample key and it is not signed.

apt-get install courier-ldap
apt-get install courier-maildrop
apt-get install courier-pop
apt-get install courier-pop-ssl

This is required for imap so that it can be notified of changes in
the mail file directories.

apt-get install fam

--------------------------
SASL Authentication System
--------------------------

apt-get install libsasl2/testing  (This will downgrade the current
                                   libsasl2 to the testing as there
                                   are problems with the unstable
                                   which is installed with the Knoppix
                                   distribution)

apt-get install libsasl2-modules
apt-get install libsasl-digestmd5
apt-get install sasl2-bin
apt-get install libpam-ldap (this may allready be on your system)


-----------------------
Mailman Listserv Manager
------------------------

apt-get install mailman

This will ask you for languages for the email lists. Please think
carefuly of all the languages you and your organization might need.
For this example we left the default, which is en for english.

Note the warning on creating the site list.

Immediately after the installation, run

newlist mailman

This will prompt information for the mailman mail list owner.
Use a valid email address for the owner. I used allyn at freegeek.org
Use a password and write it down. I used secret

The installer will then ask you to add several lines to the /etc/aliases
file. They are:

## mailman mailing list
mailman:              "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman post mailman"
mailman-admin:        "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman admin mailman"
mailman-bounces:      "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman bounces mailman"
mailman-confirm:      "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman confirm mailman"
mailman-join:         "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman join mailman"
mailman-leave:        "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman leave mailman"
mailman-owner:        "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman owner mailman"
mailman-request:      "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman request mailman"
mailman-subscribe:    "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman subscribe mailman"
mailman-unsubscribe:  "|/var/lib/mailman/mail/mailman unsubscribe mailman"

Once you added these to /etc/aliases, you will need to run
the newaliases command.

------------------------
Opengroupware Calendaring & Address book
------------------------

Add the following line into you /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb http://www.opengroupware.org/packages deb/

Now do:

apt-get install opengroupware.org


------------------------------------------------------------

At this time, the package installations are complete. Now, re-boot
the system and ensure that the following are running as a minimum:

mailman
courier
postfix
apache
ssh
slapd
postgres

------------------------------------------------------------

Now it's time to do the configurations and setup. Much of these
procedures depend on your organization's personal information.
For this document, I will be using the following identifying
information, which, of course, you will replace with your own:

Country: US
State: OR
Locale: Portland
Organization: Free Geek
Organizational Unit: Collab Tech
Domain Name: freegeek.org
Server Name: collab-dev or collab-dev.freegeek.org
Admin's email address: allyn at freegeek.org
LDAP initial admin cn: "cn=admin,dc=freegeek,dc=org"
LDAP initial admin password: secret
Mailman admin password: secret
SSL Certificate Authority pass-phrase: secret123

------------------------------------------------------------

At this time, we need to set up the keys and certificates for the
SSL (encrypted secure socket or transmission) for apache, postfix,
and courier imap/pop. We will be creating all of the required keys
at this time and then installing them later as we get to each
respective package.

These steps are to be done as the root user.

Get into the /etc/ssl directory by doing cd /etc/ssl

Edit the openssl.cnf file:
Change the following:
default_days = 10000
default_crl_days = 5000
  (we don't need to have to change each year)
countryName_default = US
stateOrProvinceName_default = OR
add: localityName_default = Portland
0.organizationName_default = Free Geek
organizationalUnitName_default  = Collab Tech
  (you will need to uncomment this one)
add: emailAddress_default = allyn at freegeek.org

For my system, I will be generating my own certificate signing
authority. Some of you may choose to have your certificates signed
by a recognized certificate authority. This will cost money, but it
will mean that popular browsers will not pop up with the warning about
an unrecognized certificate when your site is accessed. This is up to
you. If you choose to use an existing certificate signing authority,
you should disregard the steps that are related to makeing and using
our own certificate signing authority (CA).

First, we will generate the private keys.

Certificate authority (skip this if you are using another CA):

openssl genrsa -des3 -out private/cakey.pem 2048
  This will prompt for a pass phrase. Please carefuly enter and
  note/remember what you used. I used secret123

This will create a key file called cakey.pem

Apache, Postfix, Courier:

dd if=/dev/urandom of=private/imapd.rand count=1 2>/dev/null
dd if=/dev/urandom of=private/popd.rand count=1 2>/dev/null


openssl genrsa -out private/apache_key.pem 2048
openssl genrsa -out private/postfix_key.pem 2048
openssl genrsa -out private/courier_imap_key.pem 2048
openssl genrsa -out private/courier_pop_key.pem 2048

Now we will create the certificate signing requests (unsigned certficates)

openssl req -new -key private/apache_key.pem -out certs/apache_cert.csr
openssl req -new -key private/postfix_key.pem -out certs/postfix_cert.csr
openssl req -new -key private/courier_imap_key.pem -out certs/courier_imap_cert.csr
openssl req -new -key private/courier_pop_key.pem -out certs/courier_pop_cert.csr

Each of these processes will ask you some questions.
Most of them will have default answers taken from the
openssl.cnf file you filled in earlier. There will be
an entry for the Common Name that will not have a
default answer. You will need to respond to that question
with the server's name, not your own name. For my
example, I used collab-dev.

This is for the certificate authority. Skip if you are using someone else's

openssl req -days 5000 -new -x509 -key private/cakey.pem -out certs/ca_cert.pem

Now we will sign the certificates (again, skip this section if you are having
  the certificates signed by another certficate signing authority)

openssl x509 -req -in certs/apache_cert.csr -out certs/apache_cert.pem \
	-signkey private/apache_key.pem \
	-CA certs/ca_cert.pem -CAkey private/cakey.pem -CAcreateserial -days 5000

openssl x509 -req -in certs/postfix_cert.csr -out certs/postfix_cert.pem \
	-signkey private/postfix_key.pem \
	-CA certs/ca_cert.pem -CAkey private/cakey.pem -CAcreateserial -days 5000

openssl x509 -req -in certs/courier_imap_cert.csr -out certs/courier_imap_cert.pem \
	-signkey private/courier_imap_key.pem \
	-CA certs/ca_cert.pem -CAkey private/cakey.pem -CAcreateserial -days 5000

openssl x509 -req -in certs/courier_pop_cert.csr -out certs/courier_pop_cert.pem \
	-signkey private/courier_pop_key.pem \
	-CA certs/ca_cert.pem -CAkey private/cakey.pem -CAcreateserial -days 5000

Now we set up the diffi helmen stuff for the imap and pop certificates

openssl gendh -rand private/imapd.rand 512 >>certs/courier_imap_cert.pem
openssl gendh -rand private/popd.rand 512 >>certs/courier_pop_cert.pem

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we will configure the apache web server.

As the root user, ensure that you are in the /etc/apache directory.

Edit the httpd.conf file and ensure that the ServerName value is set
to the true server name (collab-dev) and not to localhost.

Edit the /etc/hosts file and ensure that the host collab-dev is set
with the host's real IP address and not the localhost's address of
127.0.0.1 as this may break some web based applications.

This apache installation from the Knoppix distribution does include
the ssl (secure socket capable) apache server. This does need to be
configured and supplied with the certificate.

First, we need to remove all old keys and certs. These are dummies
that were supplied by apache and are not signed or valid.

Ensure you are in the /etc/apache directory and do:

find ssl* -type f -name \*key -exec rm -f {} \;
find ssl* -type f -name \*crt -exec rm -f {} \;
find ssl* -type f -name \*csr -exec rm -f {} \;
find ssl* -type f -name \*prm -exec rm -f {} \;
find ssl* -type f -name \*pem -exec rm -f {} \;

Now copy in the newly created key and cert files by:

cp /etc/ssl/certs/apache_cert.pem ssl.crt/apache_cert.pem
cp /etc/ssl/private/apache_key.pem ssl.key/apache_key.pem

Now we need to edit the conf.d/mod-ssl-01-vhost.conf file (which is
one of the configuration files for the ssl apache server)

We will be working in the <VirtualHost _default_:443> section.

Change the DocumentRoot to /var/www (which is the same as the
main server) The point of this is that we need to have most of
the stuff that is being served by this system to be under cover
of SSL (encryption) as most users will be either entering
passwords or dealing with emails and other personal, confidential
data. In this case, it should be handy to have the default install
of the various packages to fall into /var/www as the default and
to have that document root be that of the secure server. Later, we
will change the document root of the non-secure server to something
else.

We now need to change or set the following two entries to point
to the new certificate and key files that we have just installed:

SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache/ssl.crt/apache_cert.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache/ssl.key/apache_key.pem

Now you need to stop and start the apache web server. Do:

/etc/init.d/apache stop
/etc/init.d/apache start

Use a web browser and go to:

https://your-server-name (in our example, https://collab-dev

If you have used a recognized certificate authority, you will be
able to get at the apache greeting page directly. If, however, you
created your own certificate authority as I had in this example, you
will be warned that your brower has not recognized the certificate
authority. Click accept to accept it, or if you want to make sure that
what you did was valid, you can click on details to look at the
certificate information.

---------------------------------------------------------------

LDAP configuration:

First, we need to set up a virtual email user account that holds
the email boxes for all of the email users. We need to do this
at this time because the uid and the gid of this account are needed
for the procedure to set up the initial LDAP database.

As root, do:

adduser vmail

This will ask you stuff, including a password. Note / remember
the password as you may need it in the future.

When you are done, look at the /etc/passwd file and note the uid
and the gid of the vhost user. It should be 1002. Make a note
of it.

You need to set up the courier imap ldap schema. First, you
must copy the schema file into the /etc/ldap heiarchy. As root
do:

cp /usr/share/doc/courier-ldap/authldap.schema /etc/ldap/schema/courier.schema

Then add it into the /etc/ldap/slapd.conf file by adding the following line
after the other include lines:

include         /etc/ldap/schema/courier.schema

While you are editing the /etc/ldap/slapd.conf file, please ensure
that you have the following set:

allow 		bind_v2
(this may be there, but commented out. Uncomment it.)

index           default pres,eq
index           objectClass eq
index           cn,sn,uid,mail pres,eq,sub

access to attribute=userPassword
        by dn="cn=admin,dc=freegeek,dc=org" write
        by anonymous auth
        by self write
        by * none

access to dn.base="" by * read

access to *
        by dn="cn=admin,dc=freegeek,dc=org" write
        by * read

Also, please ensure that the rootdn and rootpw entries are not
included in this file. They will be entered directly into the new
database during the procedures below. This will help ensure that the
admin password is not visible outside the database.

Now, please now stop the ldap server by doing:
/etc/init.d/slapd stop

Do a ps -ef and make sure that there are no slapd daemons running.

At this time, we will be removing the current LDAP database
because we are not sure of its contents and access conrol lists.
We might as well start fresh with something that is known.

As root, do:

rm -rf /var/lib/ldap/*

This will remove all ldap database files.

Once this is done, you will now create a new database that has
the admin user information as well as a template mail user account.

First, you will need to establish the hash for the admin user
password. Do:

slappasswd

This will prompt you for a new password. Please enter this carefuly
and remember it. Once you have entered it and then confirmed it, you
will be given a hash. Please be aware that you cannot recover the
password if you lose it and you would have to re-set it using this
procedure. Carefuly copy the resulting hash. Please be aware that
this hash is case sensitive and it should be copied exactly as seen.
Use the mouse cut and paste if you can.

Now, you will be creating the initial database creation file. This
file will be used by the slapadd utility. Please copy and paste the
following (between, but not including  the *********** lines)
to a file; use the file name /etc/ldap/start.ldif

***********************************************************************

In the above file, wherever you see freegeek, Free Geek, Portland,
or any other location/organizational specific things, please
substitute the ones that you will be needing for your organization.

Also, be sure that the gidNumber and the uidNumber agree with the
vhost user's gid and uid that you have created and noted at the
beginning of this LDAP setup procedure.

And, of course, you need to copy (paste) your admin password hash
that you generated prior to this step, into the userPassword entry.

Once this file is created, you need to do:

slapadd -v < /etc/ldap/start.ldif

You should see something like:

added: "dc=freegeek,dc=org" (00000001)
added: "cn=admin,dc=freegeek,dc=org" (00000002)
added: "uid=tuser at freegeek.org,dc=freegeek,dc=org" (00000003)

At this point, you need to start the ldap server by:

/etc/init.d/slapd start

At this time, we are going to check to see that the LDAP server is up and
running and is accessible via the phpldapadmin package which is a web based
LDAP server administration tool.

On your web browser, please go the following address (replace collab-dev
with your server name)

https://collab-dev/phpldapadmin

You should be greeted with php ldap admin banner page. On the left, please
click on Login. You will be presented with the login banner. Carefuly check
to see that your Login DN is correct for your LDAP database. For our example,
it should be: cn=admin,dc=freegeek,dc=org

Enter your LDAP password (you did write it down, I hope). For our example, it
was secret

Once you log in, you should be greeted with the top level information to your
server in the column on the left.

Click on the + sign to the left of the top level domain (the little globe
icon). This will display a drop menu showing the objects in your
ldap database that you have so far.

We will now add an email user to the ldap database. This will be
the procedure you will use to add accounts to your email system.

Click on the uid=tuser at freegeek.org entry. Don't click on the + sign to
the left of it, just click on the entry itself.

This will open a form in the panel to the right. Click on the Copy
this entry link that is toward the upper left corner of this screen.

This will present a Copy screen. In the Destination DN, you
will need to make a change to the uid attribute. Change the
template_user value to something new. For our example, we will
change it to john_jones but be carefull not to erase or change
the 'uid=' as they are needed. Click on the copy buttun.

You will see a plain window with:

 Copy successful! Would you like to view the new entry?

Click on the view the new entry words as this is a link.

You will see an editing panel. Please be carefull while yo make
the changes as some of the values must be left alone.

Change the CN field from Template to the user's first name. In
our example, that will be John.

Change the tuser name in homeDirectory to the mail directory
name. A good system to use is a combination of the first initial
and the last name. In our example, that would be jjones but be
careful not to change anything before the last / charactor as
this path is needed by the postfix and the courier systems.

Change the mail to the user's email address. In our example, it
will be jjones at freegeek.org

Change the mailbox attribute to be the same as the homeDirectory
above.

Change the sn to the user's last name. In our case, this would
be Jones

Enter (and remember) a password for the user.

Please leave the other fields as they are.

When you are through, click on save changes. Your browser may ask
if you want to remeber the password. Click no.

You will now be in a confirmation screen where you see the old
values and the new values. Check these. If you are happy, please
click on the green Commit button.

This will result in yet another display of the user's information,
however you are through with adding this user. If you want to add
another user, to to the left side panel and click on the
uid=template_user entry and start this procedure again.

Once you have completed adding the initial email users, run
the slapindex by doing:

slapindex

This will generate the ldap indexes.

At this time, your ldap server is configured. You may exit the
phpldapadmin web utility.


========================================================================

SASL Authentication (which is needed by postfix)

At this point, we will set up the sasl authentication system which
postfix needs for providing SMTP authentication via the ldap authentication
database that we just set up in the proceeding steps above. The sasl
authentication daemon will be set up to communicate via the pam authentication
system to the password data in the ldap directory.

Edit the /etc/default/saslauthd file and uncomment "START=yes" line
so that the saslauthd will run on system boot. Also, ensure that the
line 'MECHANISMS="pam"' is there as well.

Because by default Postfix on Debian seems like it chroots, we need to
make saslauthd's socket file accessible to both the chrooted Postfix and
saslauthd. This seemed to make sense over turning off chroot, since we
need to take the path of "minimal resistance" with respect to the way
the Debian packages do their work as well as to make this system less
vulnerable to attacks via the postfix SMTP daemon (port 25).

Do:

mkdir -p /var/spool/postfix/var/run
mv /var/run/saslauthd /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd
ln -s /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd /var/run/saslauthd

Re-start the saslauthd by:

/etc/init.d/saslauthd stop
/etc/init.d/saslauthd start


Check the following log files to ensure that saslauthd started
with no errors:

/var/log/syslog
/var/log/auth.log


Create / Edit /etc/pam.d/smtp to set up the pam stuff for smtp. This
will include both ldap as well as the system accounts (root, etc).
This file should look something like:

        auth            sufficient      pam_ldap.so
        auth            required        pam_unix.so use_first_pass
        account         sufficient      pam_ldap.so
        account         required        pam_unix.so use_first_pass
        password        sufficient      pam_ldap.so
        password        required        pam_unix.so use_first_pass
        session         required        pam_unix.so


Once you have this file, you will need to put it in place in
the postfix chroot environment. Do:

mkdir /var/spool/postfix/etc/pam.d
cp /etc/pam.d/smtp /var/spool/postfix/etc/pam.d/smtp


Edit / Create the /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf file which configures
postfix to do SASL authentication.

This file (/etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf) should contain the following
lines:

        mech_list: PLAIN
        minimum_layer: 0
        pwcheck_method: saslauthd
        auto_transition: no


Edit the /etc/pam_ldap.conf file to ensure that the pam password
authentication manager can get at the ldap database. You will need to
set the rootbinddn variable as well as the base variable.

The following lines should be in that file:

base dc=freegeek,dc=org
rootbinddn cn=admin,dc=freegeek,dc=org

Edit / create a file named /etc/ldap.secret and put in the ldap
admin password. Make sure the mode of that file is 600. This file
is needed so that pam can access the ldap directory.

Now lets test the saslauthd configuration.

First, either reboot the machine or do the following to ensure
that saslauthd is running with the latest configuration:

/etc/init.d/saslauthd stop
/etc/init.d/saslauthd start

now do:

testsaslauthd -u template_user -p secret -s smtp

(This attempts to do an authentication on thet template_user
email account).

========================================================================

Email system configuration and preparation

Edit the /etc/groups file and ensure that postfix is a member
of the sasl group. This is necessary for sasl authentication.

At this time, we will be creating the initial email boxes for the
new email accounts.

To make this part of the job easier, as well as when you add accounts
later, and especially if you have to add large numbers of accounts;
you can make a script to do this part of the job. Please carefuly copy
and paste the following (between, but not including, the #############
lines:

Please note that you will have to change the systempass, the systemlogin,
and the systemtop values to reflect your organization.
########################################################################
systempass=secret
systemlogin="cn=admin,dc=freegeek,dc=org"
systemtop="dc=freegeek,dc=org"

dirs=`ldapsearch -x -w $systempass -D "$systemlogin" -b "$systemtop" \
        mailbox | grep "^[^#]" | grep mailbox | awk '{ print $2 }'`

for ddir in $dirs

do
        if [ ! -d $ddir ]
        then
                mkdir -p $ddir
        fi
done

#######################################################################

This script needs to be run as the vmail user because these mail
directories must be owned by the vmail user

This create empty directories in the vmail user account whereupon
the email transport agent will put users' email and the courier
imap will access the email for users' access over imap and pop.


Postfix runs in a chroot environment. It will need its own
versions of some of the standard /etc directory files.
Please ensure that the following files are in the
/var/spool/postfix/etc directory and that they are similar to
those in the /etc directory:

hosts
localtime
nsswitch.conf
pam.d/*
resolv.conf
services


Now we need to configure the postfix MTA server.

Go to the /etc/postfix directory

Edit the /etc/postfix/main.cf file and add the follwing lines:

smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtpd_sasl_local_domain =
broken_sasl_auth_clients = yes
smtpd_use_tls = yes
smtpd_tls_auth_only = yes
smtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/postfix/ssl/tls_key.pem
smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/postfix/ssl/tls_cert.pem
smtpd_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/ssl/tls_ca.pem
smtpd_tls_loglevel = 3
smtpd_tls_received_header = yes
smtpd_tls_session_cache_timeout = 3600s
tls_random_source = dev:/dev/urandom
smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
	permit_sasl_authenticated,
	permit_mynetworks,
	check_relay_domains,
        reject_unknown_sender_domain,
        reject_unknown_recipient_domain,
        reject_unauth_pipelining,
        reject_non_fqdn_recipient,
        reject_unauth_destination,
        reject_rbl_client relays.ordb.org,
        reject_rbl_client opm.blitzed.org,
        reject_rbl_client list.dsbl.org,
        reject_rbl_client sbl.spamhaus.org,
        reject_rbl_client cbl.abuseat.org,
        reject_rbl_client dnsbl.sorbs.net,
        permit


local_transport = virtual
virtual_mailbox_base = /
virtual_mailbox_domains = freegeek.org
virtual_mailbox_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual_mailbox, ldap:ldapvirtual
virtual_uid_maps = static:1002
virtual_gid_maps = static:1002
virtual_minimum_uid = 1002
virtual_mailbox_limit = 0
ldapvirtual_server_host = localhost
ldapvirtual_server_port = 389
ldapvirtual_bind = yes
ldapvirtual_bind_dn = cn=admin,dc=freegeek,dc=org
ldapvirtual_bind_pw = secret
ldapvirtual_search_base = dc=freegeek,dc=org
ldapvirtual_query_filter = (mail=%s)
ldapvirtual_result_attribute = mailbox


Please note that the information in these lines will vary
according to the name, domain, password, and location
of your own organization.

Also, make sure that the mynetworks entry has the information
for your own numerical IP networks. For our example at Free Geek,
it would look something like:

mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8,192.168.7.0/32

Also, make sure that the mydestination entry does not include
the virtual domain that you included above. The mydestination
entry is for local (those having machine accounts) only.

Create a file at /etc/postfix/virtual_mailbox and put in the
following lines:

root at freegeek.org       /home/vmail/domains/freegeek.org/admin/
postmaster at freegeek.org /home/vmail/domains/freegeek.org/admin/
abuse at freegeek.org      /home/vmail/domains/freegeek.org/admin/

(remember that the 'freegeek' name needs to be replaced with
the domainname of your organization. Also remember that you
must have the following slash at the end of each line in order
to utilize the Mailbox mail format.

After creating this file, you must run the postmap command:

postmap virtual_mailbox

Now, copy in the postfix certificate and key files for
the tls transport. Do:

mkdir /etc/postfix/ssl
cp /etc/ssl/certs/postfix_cert.pem /etc/postfix/ssl/tls_cert.pem
cp /etc/ssl/certs/ca_cert.pem /etc/postfix/ssl/tls_ca.pem
cp /etc/ssl/private/postfix_key.pem /etc/postfix/ssl/tls_key.pem

Create a file at /usr/lib/sasl2/smtpd.conf and put in it
the following line:

pwcheck_method: saslauthd


Edit the /etc/postfix/master.cf file and ensure that the
following three lines are not commented (they usualy are
in a default instalation)

tlsmgr    fifo  -       -       n       300     1       tlsmgr
smtps     inet  n       -       n       -       -       smtpd -o smtpd_tls_wrappermode=yes -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes


Now lets do some basic checks on postfix.

First, lets try to have it do a basic email. Here is a
typical ineraction upong invoking 'telnet localhost 25' on
the mail server:

telnet localhost 25
220 collab-dev ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)
helo collab-dev.freegeek.org
250 collab-dev
mail from: allyn at freegeek.org
250 Ok
mail to:arosenau at freegeek.org
503 Error: nested MAIL command
rcpt to: arosenau at freegeek.org
250 Ok
data
354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>
Hello Art!
.
250 Ok: queued as 91016FBC3A
quit
221 Bye
Connection closed by foreign host.


Now, lets check to see that the mail server can handle tls (encryption)
and authentication. For this, we will use the openssl s_client testing
facility. First, we have to encode the username and password:

printf 'user\0user\0pass' | mimencode (which in our example would be)

printf 'arosenau at freegeek.org\0arosenau at freegeek.org\0secret6' | mimencode
This outputs:
YXJ0aHVyX3Jvc2VuYXUAYXJ0aHVyX3Jvc2VuYXUAc2VjcmV0Ng==

Now you need to invoke the openssl test client facility which
will give  you an interactive session on the mail server's
tls service. Do:

openssl s_client -connect collab-dev:465 -CAfile /etc/ssl/certs/ca_cert.pem

You will get a bunch of ssl related status information and then you will
get the smtp interactive prompt:

220 collab-dev ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)

at this point, you can do:

auth plain YXJ0aHVyX3Jvc2VuYXUAYXJ0aHVyX3Jvc2VuYXUAc2VjcmV0Ng==

at which point, you should get:
235 Authentication successful

Type quit and you will exit the interactive session.

This complets the basic instalation and configuration of the
postfix email system.

==============================================================

Courier Imap and Pop server configuration

The Courier Imap and Pop server must be configured to be able
to authenticate via the LDAP database.

First, go to the /etc/courier directory:

cd /etc/courier

Then edit the authldaprc file. Ensure that the following lines
are in the file (there will be others; these are the most
important)

LDAP_SERVER             localhost
LDAP_PORT               389

LDAP_BASEDN             dc=freegeek, dc=org
LDAP_BINDDN             cn=admin,dc=freegeek,dc=org
LDAP_BINDPW             secret

LDAP_TIMEOUT            5

LDAP_MAIL               mail

LDAP_DOMAIN             freegeek.org

LDAP_GLOB_UID           vmail
LDAP_GLOB_GID           vmail

LDAP_HOMEDIR            homeDirectory
LDAP_MAILDIR            mailbox

LDAP_DEFAULTDELIVERY    defaultDelivery

LDAP_FULLNAME           uid

LDAP_CLEARPW            clearPassword
LDAP_CRYPTPW            userPassword


Now edit the authdaemonrc file and change the entry for
authmodulelist="authldap" to:
authmodulelist="authldap"

Now we need to copy in the certificates that are required for
imap and pop secure layer (ssl / encryption). Please do:

cp /etc/ssl/private/courier_imap_key.pem imapd.pem
cp /etc/ssl/private/courier_pop_key.pem pop3d.pem
cat /etc/ssl/certs/courier_imap_cert.pem >>imapd.pem
cat /etc/ssl/certs/courier_pop_cert.pem >>pop3d.pem

Please note that these files are actualy concatinations of the
respective key and signed certificate files. The Courier imap/pop
servers use combinational certificate files that contain the
certificate, the key, and the diffe helmen information.


Mailman:

Go to /etc/mailman

Edit mm_cfg.py

Ensure that DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST = 'lists.freegeek.org' is
correct for your particular organization.

Uncomment MTA='Postfix'

Add following lines:

POSTFIX_ALIAS_CMD = /usr/sbin/postalias
POSTFIX_MAP_CMD = /usr/sbin/postmap

Then do:

cd /usr/lib/mailman
bin/genaliases
chown list:list /var/lib/mailman/data/aliases*
chmod g+w aliases.db

Add these lines in you /etc/apache/httpd.conf file:

ScriptAlias /mailman/ /var/lib/mailman/cgi-bin/
Alias /pipermail/ /var/lib/mailman/archives/public/
<Directory /var/lib/mailman/archives>
    Options +FollowSymlinks
</Directory>
<Directory /var/lib/mailman/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options +ExecCGI
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

Now create the initial site password (this password is the one
that is necessary to create email lists)

Do:

cd /usr/lib/mailmain
bin/mmsitepass

This will prompt you to enter a new password. You will do
it twice for verification.


Mailman is now ready for you to create your first email list.
To set up email lists, please use your web browser and go to:
https://Your.host.name/mailmain/admin and follow the instructions.

Please note that email lists for the listserv are at:

list_name at lists.freegeek.org (or lists.yourdomain.org).

=================================================================

                    Final Notes on Email

This concludes the installation of the back-end email infrastructure.
>From here on, you will need to ensure that your DNS services have
established that this server is pointed to via an MX record for
the domain name that you will be using and that this server has
access to the outside internet (either being outside the firewall
or more preferably, be inside the firewall with a pin-hole in
the firewall for ports 25 (smtp) and port 465 (secure smtp).
Depending on your security policies,  you might also have pin-holes
set up for the imaps and pop3s (secure imap and pop3 ports; numbered
993 and 995 respectively). You will also need to open email accounts
by using the phpldapadmin utility as discussed earlier in this
document or by setting up input files for the slapadd utility.

Please also be aware that some imap and pop clients may have
problems with some types of certificates that may be used for
the imaps and pop3s (secure imap and pop) protocols.

Please also be aware that the smtp authentication is allowd only
for secure smtp connections. Attempts to perform authentication
via an non-secure smtp connection will be rejected. This is because
the auth plain method is the only one available due to the limitations
of the saslauthd authentication system. The auth plain method does
involved unencrypted passwords, which must be protected by the
covering of a secure smtp connection.

This email system is set up with limited spam filtering; this
namely via the blacklisting facility as furnished by the blacklist
sites that are configured in the /etc/postfix/main.cf file.
These blacklist sites are consulted by postfix as mail arrives
into the system. As configures, this means that email arriving
to the listserve (mailman) is also checked against the blacklist
sites before being allowed into the server.

=================================================================
Next, we will set up the Opengroupware calendaring and adressbook
service. Please not that at this time, the Opengroupware
service has its own authentication as it is not yet implemented to
authenticate by using the ldap database that is used by the
email back end for authentication.

First, we will need to set up the postgres database. Go to the
/var/lib/postgres/data directory.

Edit the pg_hba.conf file.

Ensure you have the following lines as they are below. They may be
separated by comment lines, which is okey.

local   all         all                                             trust
host    all         all         127.0.0.1         255.255.255.255   trust
host    all         all         0.0.0.0           255.255.255.255   reject

Close this file and edit the postgresql.conf file and ensure that the
tcpip_socket = true
line is there and not commented.

Close this file and then restart postgres by doing:

/etc/init.d/postgresql restart

su to the postgres user by doing

su - postgres

Then as postgres, do the follosing steps:

createdb ogo
createuser -a -d ogo
psql ogo ogo

This will put you in the postgres sql prompt. Do:

\i /usr/lib/opengroupware.org/Database/PostgreSQL/pg-build-schema.psql

You will get a bunch of output as the initial Opengroupware database
is being created on the database server. When this is done, do

\q

And you will be once again back at the system prompt.

Exit your session as postgres by typing 'exit'. You will now once
again be root.

Do:

chown -R opengroupware.skyrix /usr/lib/opengroupware.org

Then su to the opengroupware user by doing:

su - opengroupware

As the opengroupware user do the following:

####################################################################################

Please make this file executable by doing:

chmod +x /etc/init.d/opengroupware

Place a symbolic link to it in the /etc/rc3.d

ln -s /etc/init.d/opengroupware /etc/rc3.d/s60opengroupware


Now we need to download and compile the special Apache web connector
for Opengroupware; do:

wget http://www.opengroupware.org/sources/opengroupware.org-mod_ngobjweb-latest.tar.gz

tar xpzf opengroupware.org-mod_ngobjweb-latest.tar.gz
cd opengroupware.org-mod_ngobjweb

Edit the GNUMakefile file and ensure that the following lines
are in that file:

APXS   = /usr/bin/apxs
HTTPD  = /usr/sbin/apache

These variables may be set in lines similar to:

APACHE = /usr
APXS   = $(APACHE)/bin/apxs
HTTPD  = $(APACHE)/sbin/apache

This is okey as well. Sometimes you might see APXS = $(APACHE)/sbin/apxs
which needs to be corrected.

Now compile by doing:

make

Create the directory /usr/lib/opengroupware.org/WebServer by doing:

mkdir /usr/lib/opengroupware.org/WebServer

Copy the executable into place by doing:

cp ngobjweb_1.3.31.so /usr/lib/opengroupware.org/WebServer

Please note that this file's name may vary depending on the version
of the apache server.

Now change ownership to opengroupwer by doing:

chown -R opengroupware.skyrix /usr/lib/opengroupware.org/WebServer

Now you will need to set up the apache web server so that it can
access the opengroupware server.

As root, edit the /etc/apache/httpd.conf file.

Add the following line in the file; sometime after the
Include /etc/apache/modules.conf line:

LoadModule ngobjweb_module /usr/lib/opengroupware.org/WebServer/ngobjweb_1.3.31.so

(Note this may change, depending on the version of the apache web server)

Then, after this line, add the following lines:

<LocationMatch "^/OpenGroupware/*">
  SetHandler ngobjweb-adaptor
  SetAppPort 20000
</LocationMatch>

Alias /OpenGroupware.woa/WebServerResources/ \
      /usr/lib/opengroupware.org/WebServerResources/

Try starting the opengroupware by doing:

/etc/init.d/opengroupware start

It should start. You may, however get an error messages about
a missing shared object file. This is because the Zidestore
may be compiled with an earlier version of ssl. If this happens,
you can do:

ln -s /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.7 /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.6
ln -s /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.7 /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.6

You mean, before I go off on the opposite political view.  Shame.

Hmm, I'm not so suspicious of the use of the war that I'm incapable of 
believing
there are good things going on in Iraq.  Are you satisfied that you have
won something now?  Is anyone person who is politically different from you
correcting you the minute he/she speak up?

 From the way you talk about Iraq and "assholes," who wouldn't be suspicious
and put off?  My only mistake, perhaps, is mentioning I have an opposing 
view.
There's no standard of politcal hedgemony here though, right?  Surely we can
all just get along.

I had /var/log on a CF filesystem and it croaked after about 6 months of

Wow. Where to begin.
I'll start with my largest pet peeve.

Don't reject mail just because ONE rbl thinks its from a "bad" IP. If 
you've ever run a mail server for a large user base, you know that this 
will result in hundereds of lost emails.
Spamassassin (works great with postfix/amavisd, btw) can use these rbl's 
to add a few points to a total spam score.. a much better way to use an 
rbl.
Remember what happened when a not-so-friendly rbl quit the rbl business 
and just started sending "reject" to everyone that queried it?

Anyways.. the LAST thing we want is for "dummies" as you say; to be 
running mail servers! I could go on and on about this... but I think the 
  whole thing is a bad idea.

Cheers;
Charlie

I have a couple of things to say.

First of all, I need to apologise for the double emailing
of my request. I inadvertantly closed one session, not relizing
that it sent out email. Thank you for catching me on this.

Also, I have to agres with the point you made on spam. I
took the spam rbl list from another HOWTO on setting up
postfix.

Spam handling is one of my weaker issues.

Since I am running postfix with virtual mailboxes (virtual
delivery) I don't know how to incorporate spamassasin and
procmail into this because I don't know how to communicate
virtual mailboxes from postfix's virtual delivery service
to procmail.

This may be a dumb question, but how can I incorporate
spamassasin (and other spam tools) without using procmail
to send spam stuff to another sub-mailbox under each users'
Maildir.

I generally agree with Charlie, but I do use a select few RBLs at SMTP
that are reasonably conservative and responsive to removal requests.

FWIW...When all I had was WEP available to secure my WIFI network at 
home I added a 3rd NIC to my firewall and put my access point on a 
completely separate network. I used OpenBSD's "authpf" feature to 
dynamically add rules to my firewall to allow access to my internal 
network from the WIFI side. Before anyone could get into the private 
network they had to authenticate through my firewall with a SSH session. 
Once the SSH session was setup a user could then get into the internal 
network. I also ran "arpwatch" which would notify me if MAC addresses 
changed on any of my WIFI hosts.  When the SSH shell session is 
terminated, the firewall rules are dynamically altered to remove the 
rule that allowed the WIFI user into the private network.

Now that access points and WIFI routers support WPA I can now use TKIP 
or AES encryption for better security. WinXP supports WPA and Linux does 
as well with the addition of the "wpa_supplicant" daemon.  I like to 
survey WIFI networks when I travel and so far I still see most WIFI 
networks left wide open with no WEP or WPA enabled at all since that's 
the default for WIFI access points and routers. WIFI works great when 
things are wide open but once people try to start using encryption 
things don't work as well, people become frustrated and tend to go back 
to having things wide open.

I've worked on setting WIFI networks up for the last  1 1/2 years and 
trying to get everyone's client working with WEP or WPA can be time 
consuming.  My own take is that since both WinXP and Linux have support 
for WPA and all of the newer access points and routers also support WPA 
that it should be used over WEP. I know there can be legacy support 
issues with WPA and so sometime an older system only supports WEP. I 
used to have a Win2K laptop I was issued from work and it only supported 
WEP and so I wasn't able to use WPA at home until I was issued a newer 
laptop that runs both WinXP and Linux.

Greylisting is a very helpful approach.  It keeps you from working
with people who don't configure their mail servers correctly.
Even though it slows mail down, it has stopped practically all
of the junk.
  
The other thing I do is block unresolvable mail clients which probably
stops the bulk of the junk, but this will block a lot of valid sites.  I've
been trying to run relays out of ramdisk, but so far I haven't modified
the postfix scripts to make this will work well.  What I would like is
a daemon that occasionally backs up, or updates, what is backed up
on five minute intervals.  During a shutdown, the daemon should
image what's on ramdisk in entirety.  When mail is flowing, there
shouldn't be anything cached and hence no wear on my flash device.
Rejecting when you can't find the supplied hostname stops a lot of
garbage.  I wish there was a way to discourage the sources of the
junk though.  I think a lot of it is coming from worms.  I get a lot
of the same junk from supposedly different sites, so I wonder
if the orgin is the same.

I'm all for looking into why people have difficulty implementing secure
email systems.  Every insecure server with Net access increases the
amount of abuse possible.  The slow adoption of widely supported
standards also contributes to the spam epidemic.  There is a lot of narrow
minded shortsighted code in email today which is largely proprietary and
hardly tested.  If IM2000 can be implemented in such a way that it doesn't
increase the amount of email a person gets, it sounds very promising as
a tool to control what comes in and where it comes in from.  The best
content filters engage before the content is received.  There aren't safe
email formats for everything people want to do, especially when
attachments are considered.

Use of RHSBL's and IP block lists with insecure and incomplete DNS
infrastructure seems questionable in my mind.  Block lists are a
challenge to maintain, especially if the source is forged.  A clever 
attacker
that wants you to block someone they don't like could forge that someone
in a rude message to you.  I'd say everyone should turn anti forging 
features
on in their MTA, but not everyone can depending on their needs.

Hey, folks.
I'm trying to get a reliable, reasonably-powerful box together for a
client of FreeGeek's.  I have a couple of PIII-1GHz CPUs and 4 DIMMS,
but the only motherboard I can lay hands on (Abit VP6) is seriously
flaky.

Does anyone have something laying around that might work?  Even
underclocked, it'll be a big help.  Will trade good karma, warm fuzzies
or even CASH MONEY.

After the third or fourth flakey VP6, I switched to a SuperMicro
P3TDDE (I think) and haven't had any problems with it.

Sadly, I don't have any available to help you out.  Pricewatch shows
them for circa $200.

Before you rip apart those tablet computers, a friend of mine, John Bartley,
wanted to get some of those computers for a local amateur radio group to do
emergency services.  He got there too late.   Ham radio folks are used to 
working with weird obsolete computer gear, funky batteries, and odd interfaces.

So if you have extras, please contact him at john at 503bartley.com .  

Thanks,
Keith

Subject: [PLUG] aha, you _can_ shrink an ntfs with free tools!
Message-ID: <86zn6oalx4.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

A few of you may recall at the last clinic a guy who wanted to install
linux on a box with Windows XP.  Most of us, seemingly, weren't sure
about whether it was possible to repartition an ntfs installation with
free tools.  I had shrunken a w2k fat32 filesystem a few years ago
with a different tool.  Several people remembered GNU parted, and when
we looked at that, we found that it didn't support (or didn't seem to
support) ntfs.  We had punted to partition magic, which none of us
actually had, so the guy we were trying to help was more or less SOL
on the dual booting front. His windows xp software was a
"quickrestore" type of thing that restored a 40gig filesystem, mashing
flat everything in its path.  So we just nuked xp and started working
on installing debian from CDs.  Due to the late-ish start, we didn't
quite finish.

Flash forward to last Thursday evening when he calls me at home for
some help on installing Knoppix on his harddisk.  This is another
thing I'd never done before, but with me at a networked desktop, I
could at least find stuff/instructions online.  Pretty soon I realized
that Knoppix included something called "qtparted" (IIRC) and also
("gee, this looks promising!") "ntfsresize".  A little fiddling and he
is all fixed up with free tools.

So, salt that one away.  It could come in handy in the future.

Subject: [PLUG] New FC2 Install Fails to Recognize Ethernet Card
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0406271414560.13446-100000@gisnet.com>

I tried to install Fedora Core 2 on my PII machine yesterday, it never
asked me to configure the ethernet card. It apparently didn't seem to
recognize it. Now this same, exact hardware will work fine with RH 7.3,
8.0 and 9.0 (I've tried them all in the last couple of weeks.)

Since that machine is my email server, I couldn't ask for help with eth0
DOA, so I went back to RH 9.0 and here I am. What I'd like to know is what
might have gone wrong, and is there a way to manually configure an
ethernet card if kudzu doesn't notice it? Everything else seemed to load
up just fine. Or is a PII machine just too old for FC2?

Rummaging around, I did notice a complaint in /var/log/dmesg about the
BIOS being 1997 vintage, but that was associated with something called
SAPI (whatever this is), I think.  However, I don't see any bios warnings
in the 9.0 dmesg file, and of course, everything works now. 

Anyway, if someone could give me some hints as to what to look for, and 
how to debug these sorts of things, I may give FC2 another go.

TIA,

I assume this is what Mandrake uses.  When I need to resize an NTFS
partition for a dual-boot computer, I boot into Windows and defrag the
NTFS partition, then boot from a Mandrake 9.2 CD and resize the NTFS
partition, then I cancel the Mandrake install and install my distro of
choice.  I've never encountered any problems.

No. I've got FC2 on a dual P-II and it runs like a champ. Does lspci 
report anything? E.g.,

   /sbin/lspci | grep -i ether

What module does it run in Red Hat 8/9? You might try searching 
through Red Hat's module configuration file, e.g.,

   [heinlein]$ grep -i eth /etc/modules.conf
   alias eth0 e100

Since Fedora Core 2 is based on the 2.6.x kernel series, while Red Hat 
8/9 run 2.4.x, the module required might have changed names.

In doing some testing with "linux on laptop" this week, I had the 
opportunity to load SuSe 9.1 on a HP/compaq NC6000.  I was quite surprised 
when then installer auto-resized the W2K partion on the fly and subsequent 
dual boots seems to work okay.  Sadly I didn't have the laptop long 
enough to investigate what actually went on.

What kind of ethernet card is it?  Is it pci or isa?  If it is isa, you
may have to use the plug and play utilities to get it to configure
correctly.  Do you know what chipset it is?  It could also be trying to
load the wrong driver.  (That problem occurs on some older versions of
the Realtek chipset.)

Hard to say what the problem is without knowing a bit more about your
hardware.

It's my understanding there is a bug in kudzu and some ethernet cards do 
not get setup properly.  And this happened to me also.  I ended up 
manaully configured the ethernet card then went to the FC2 mail list and 
found reference to the bug.  Mine is a 3Com 3C9XX card.

Hmmm. I will have to look into that.

Make sure you add an alias line into /etc/modprobe.conf.  It will force
the module to get loaded.

I just used the CD from http://www.sysresccd.org/ to install Linux onto a
laptop that had Windows XP preinstalled, while preserving Windows.

It includes both a recent build of ntfsresize and QtParted.  The only
difficulty was that the mouse support in QtParted didn't work, but it's
not required for resizing.

You should probably read the current issue of "Wired,"
unless you're sick of seeing Derl McBride's face, as
you probably are by now. Apparently he always carries
a gun, so this should be borne in mind.

He opposes open source because there's supposed to be
a "market" of a certain size for software, and free
software reduces the size of this market. Why not
apply this "logic" to hardware? Say there are 100
million personal computers in the US, and in 1982 a PC
available then would cost $4,000. So if those
currently in service don't cost a total of $400
billion, this indicates the extent to which purchasers
are getting a free ride.

A lot of linux users regularly or always carry firearms, too.  What's

Proficiency at an effecient means of self-defense and defense of others is not 
homicidal. A high prevalence of concealed-carry firearms amongst the honest 
citizenry, (this includes at the library and out at a restaurant,) would make 
criminal behavior in a suicidal choice - part of the criminal's deviant and 
pitiful mentality. Remember, any problem or confrontation is to be viewed as 
entirely the criminal's problem.

The gun was originally brought up to be scary and sensational to those 
unfamiliar with them as normal, everyday tools (besides defense, there is 
pest and predator control around home and farm,) any preys upon the 
stereotype that the intersection between the technologically savvy and those 
for whom a firearm is no more unusual than a chainsaw in the garage, is 
insignificant.

Closer to topic, there are some nice websites of Linux user clubs blowing 
holes in MS certificates of authenticity ...

  To put this in perspective, read the report about the interview on the
Groklaw site: <http://www.groklaw.net/>. It was there some time last week.

Sorry I didn't get back to y'all sooner, but the PLUG server must have
thought I was out of action and it didn't send me your responses. I guess
you can't bounce too many message before it cuts you off. Anyway, it's
sending me mail again, but I had to get these response off the web
archive.

To answer Alan's query, the card I'm using is an ISA BOCAlan 2000 Plus, a
"plug and pray" device.  From /var/log/dmesg it reports that the machine
is a Intel Pentium II (Klamath) with 288Mb RAM running at 233.867 MHz. The
PCI BIOS is rev 2.4, and the "PII4X: Chipset" is rev 1. Is that the info
you need to diagnose this, or do I need to look elsewhere?

Well, it works fine with kudzu in RH 7.3, 8.0 and 9.0. Is this a bug in 
the FC2 version of kudzu? How does one manually configure an ethernet 
card? Do you use ifconfig, or is there a simpler tool? I'll go see if I 
can find that reference in the FC2 list. I assume that's at RedHat's site? 
(You can probably tell I'm sort of new at this.)

Any help will be appreciated. When I try this again, I will need to know
how to use all the tools necessary to repair/configure it on my own
because I will not have e-mail to ask for help. (Kind of like taking a
space walk with no umbilical tether and you have to hold your breath while

That could be a fun PLUG get-together.  We could go out and blow holes
in certificates of authenticity, floppy disks, cd-roms, and boxes sold
by Microsoft.  Maybe take an old junker computer with one of those CD-
key stickers on it, put a .22 round right through the thing, and see if
it'll boot up with Linux after Microsoft has been shot?  :-)

Sweet.

My day job is with a _very_ cool group in a local telecom company. We've
had two "team building" outings this year: One was skeet shooting on a
farm near Battleground, WA. The other was fishing for Spring Chinook
salmon on the Columbia. Both involved much beer.

The vast majority of gun owners... regardless of the OS they're running
(SCO, Windows, Linux, Slowarus, OS X, whatever), never shoot at a human
being.  Of those who do shoot at a human being, I'd have to guess most
don't kill the person they're shooting at.  Of those who do kill who
they're shooting at, not all would be considered 'homicidal' which is
considered analogous with murderous.

I'd say calling gun owners homicidal lunatics is analogous to calling
gay men pedophiles.

ISA devices are usually not probed for, due to the tendancy to hang the 
machine.  (This is true in Windows as well.)

There are a set of isa tools available.  I forget what they are called at 
the moment.  (pnpdump?)

I am betting that the card is an ne2000 clone.  You can try loading that 
driver by hand and see if it works.  Also look for driver called "ne".  
That seems to be the driver for that card a long time ago.

If you can, i would replace that card with a pci ethernet card.  You will 
be happy you did.  ISA is just a bad idea.

  Has anyone else had problems with these units? The one I purchased started
working only intermittently after a few days. The factory refurbished one
Linksys sent as a replacement quit working a few hours after I configured
it.

  Something is definitely wrong. The unit's on a UPS, the same UPS as my
main server/workstation and wireline switch. The original unit worked for a
few minutes in someone else's office, then went comatose again.

  I need to call Linksys again, but I wonder about this model.

We have several dozen in our labs. 
Few problems other than they can't handle high loads and overall signal
strength is poor.

Have you tried a reset to default?
Also. Update the firmware if you haven't already.

Subject: [PLUG] Debian iptables firewall rule generator (like lokkit?)
Message-ID: <40E0921E.2080507@tercent.com>

Hi folks,

Does anyone have a recommendation for an iptables rule generator like 
lokkit for use with Debian stable / 2.4 kernel (preferably 
distro-agnostic as well)?

I believe that the Debian stable version of lokkit tries to write 
ipchains rules.

There are a number of packages but those I've tried seem very unfriendly 
(see, for example, the init script with one package that claims "don't 
use this init script, write your own" -- whaaa??).

I get the impression that there may be a far simpler and more ubiquitous 
solution that others are using for their iptables rules, which is why 
it's hard to find an easy to use package?

I have simple needs, like punching through ssh, http/s, and ntp.

Randall

I probably have an older revision than you...my firmware is dated
December of '02 if I remember correctly.  But mine works great, as long
as I keep on a high channel number and remember to unplug it for about
thirty seconds once a week.  And then, it only drops wireless packets,
not wired ones.

  What's a high channel number? Mine defaults to 6. I've tried unplugging
it, but not for an extended period. Is there a minimum time I should try?

  Well, this is version 4 and a factory refurbished one. Would they ship a
refurb with an outdated firmware version? I don't know policy.

  I have the bugger unplugged now. This evening I'll try resetting it --
again -- and see if that makes a difference.

  I've used the Linksys wired switches for 5+ years with no problems. That's
why I'm so puzzled with the problems I'm having.

  I'm trying to have it accept a connection from one laptop. A second one
may be talking to it just for testing purposes. Not what I'd consider to be
a heavy load. :-)

Quick howto for wireless is that there are only 3 "real" channels
Because these are 802.11b they use spread spectrum. This means that 1-5,
6-1-, and 11-14 are your only real channels and have built in guard
frequencies separating them.
Yes I know they only show 11 channels. That's because the FCC can't read
or understand technical issues sometimes.
So.... A high channel is anything above 10. Moving your channel to 7
from 6 really means your now broadcasting from 7-11 and probably
overlapping the person who has his set on 11. Interference can cause
problems with these as dropped packets etc tend to cause a lot of
retries and result in processing overhead for which there is little to
give on these units.

  OK. The default on the WAP is channel 6.

> So.... A high channel is anything above 10.

  Ergo, I need to change the default to 11, eh? I _think_ I recall seeing
something about channel in the portables, but I may well be mistaken.

I use mine as a 4 port switch. I can't even see the wireless anymore 
(after firmware upgrades and fiddling with settings.. still nothing).

Before that, it acted quite like a cheap AP ... reboot when you need to 
actually use it.

Well, I think it acts like a cheap AP for good reason... 'tis exactly

Thank goodness!  If they did, we'd have many thousands more deaths every
year.

The concern, of course, wasn't with "most gun owners", but with folks who
carry weapons on their person in public.  And while most may never
_actually_ shoot at a human being, that is the intent of the weapon and
the carrying.

Homicide is killing another human being in my book -- the law of the land
notwithstanding.  That hints at one of the major problems with capital
punishment -- it is permanent while the law of the land is transient --
and also one of the major problems with "vigilante justice" -- it
eliminates any notion of due process.

> I'd say calling gun owners homicidal lunatics is analogous to calling

Well, nobody called gun owners homocidal and I think the stronger analogy
would be calling sexually interested people pedophiles (you'll find that
most pedophiliacs are men lusting after young women, so "gay men" doesn't
seem to apply -- unless, of course, you're hinting at the relative
proportion of homocides committed by gun versus pedophilic acts committed
by gay men, but I think that's unlikely because I don't think you consider
the homocidal weapon of choice (the automobile) to be muderous and so what
you'd call homicide is done by gun more often than anything else in this
country).

If you want argue this sanely and without specious analogy, let's take it
to plug-talk.

  Perhaps I should talk with Linksys about upgrading to something that works
reliably.

I was over at my mother's "fixing" hers for a week, until I moved it approximately 6 feet from her cable modem. It was suffering from interference and would not keep /any/ settings- wired computers would "lose the internet' at random moments and wireless ones just couldn't connect for more than a few seconds.

Can I still play?

A canister of pepper spray is also a satisfactory
credential for Linux use, provided that it is at least
10% oleoresin capsium. It lacks some of the
capabilities of a gun, however.

I didn't mean to imply that it was wrong for McBride
to own a gun--if that were his worst fault, I'd feel a
lot better. But for a white-collar professional, which
he professes to be, to feel the need to carry one
constantly seems paranoid to me.

I think it is an ne2000 clone. To "load the driver by hand" do you mean 
that I edit /etc/modules.conf and add a line like:
alias eth0 ne

or something like it and then reboot? Then how do I tell it what the IP,
netmask, and gateway are? Will the configuration dialogs appear now?

A module called ne.o exists in RH 9.0 in
/lib/modules/2.4.20-6/kernel/drivers/net/, but if this isn't available in
FC2 is that what would cause the ethernet card not to be recognized during
the reboot phase of a new install? Because that's the symptom. In RH 7.3,
8.0, and 9.0 the system automatically recognized the card and allowed me
to set the IP, etc., but in FC2 this step never appeared.

I've searched the mailing list archives at RedHat.com and Fedora.org, and
all I discovered was 1.) these lists are hard to search efficiently, and
2.) there is a problem with kudzu and certain 3Comm NICs to which the
solution is to turn off kudzu. I've tried searching on various
combinations of keywords like FC2, eth0, recognized, bug, NIC, ethernet,
and bocalan. I further learned that "bocalan" doesn't show up anywhere. 
Any new search strategy suggestions would be welcome here...

> If you can, i would replace that card with a pci ethernet card.  You will

<Sigh!> ISA was a good idea until a few months ago... I mean, it works
flawlessly with all RedHat versions through 9.0. Oh well, I suppose you're
right. It just grieves me that if I want to use the latest distros, I have
to buy the latest hardware or I nearly always run into trouble bigger than
my head. I just hate throwing out perfectly good --but old-- equipment,
just because I don't know how to tweak things. 

Unless I can figure this out, I'll probably just stay with RH 9.0 if
Fedora can't handle my "legacy" (i.e. "old and in the way") equipment.

Russ,

  Mine is currently about 4' from the dsl modem. Before I bought it I saw
positive reviews and recommendations. Now more seem to be negative. Think
I'll talk with customer service at Linksys tomorrow about upgrading to
something a bit more reliable.

Thanks all,

Rich

Bill,

  You'll do that once you are sure that's the correct driver. Before then,
after the system boots, type 'modprobe ne' to load the module, then 'lsmod'
to see if it's there.

> or something like it and then reboot? Then how do I tell it what the IP,

  This is just the physical connection between the cat5 cable and your
system. What you want to do is edit /etc/hosts, /etc/hosts.deny,
/etc/hosts.allow, /etc/hosts.lpd and /etc/hosts.equiv (I think that's the
set).

  As Alan wrote, pick up an inexpensive pci NIC and use that. You'll be a
lot happier now and in the future.

  Er, ... actually, Bill, ISA cards were obsolete at least 5 years ago. That
you've had it continue to work is a testament to the linux driver folks
(hail, Greg!) who've kept it going. And, didn't you tell me only a few years
ago that every time Microsquish came out with a new version of their OS
you'd buy new hardware because upgrading in place was such a PITA?

I finally broke down and subscribed - I usually enjoy a good gun-related

They are working hard to prepare to defend us from the invasion of the 
little clay frisbies.

Actually skeetshooting is a lot of fun.  It bears little resemblance to 
killing anything but very predictable birds.

And then there is hard alcohol and lawn darts played at night...

Don't think that's all there is to it. I know there's one or more other 
files that associate eth0 with IP, netmask, gateway and DNS IP addresses. 
That info is not in those files you mention. For example, how does 
resolv.conf get populated? There's another I have in my notes at my office 
(but can't remember just now) that associates eth0 with all those numbers 
and more. I just don't know what program to run or what files to modify to 
get the necesssary data in the system.

Yep. It cost about $600 to upgrade to XP. But to tell you the truth, Rich,
I'm not saving any money with Linux at this point. I've lost several days
time trying to get this server back on its feet again. Upgrading Linux is
just as big a PITA as any other OS. And patching security holes is a
constant chore and always a PITA, just like any other OS. And if you ever
try to syncronize a new OS version with the right newer versions of
software you've had to build from source (because the rpms weren't set up
to do what you needed) good luck! I'm getting really tired of trying to
trying to get MySQL and PHP working together again with the newest RedHat
I can manage to get running so I can get my damn web pages working again.

And Linux is not magically secure, either. I've been hacked nearly as many
times using Linux as I have with Windows. I can still get free automatic
updates from Microsoft, but I can't use up2date anymore (and I haven't yet
had time to learn yum.) So right now for me Linux is harder to maintain
than Windows.

In short, I'm learning that Linux exacts its price, too. And it's NOT 
cheap when you have to make a living doing something else besides fooling 
around with a cranky server and cranky software. All of this hassle is due 
to my ignorance, of course, but when I see even experts like you go 
through epics like your current wifi experience, I wonder where is the 
light at the end of this tunnel?!? I'll never be smart enough to learn 
everything I have to learn to realize the dream I hoped for.

But I'll keep trying. I still believe that sweat equity will pay off 
eventually vs. paying rent to Microsoft, but sometimes my faith is tried 
sore.

Also look in /etc/sysconfig/(network-scripts?)/ifcfg-eth0
Not in front of my system so I'm not sure of the pathname.
Poke around a little and you should find it.

  No. Forgot about those. Red Hat has, IIRC, 'netcfg' or something like
that. It'll set up the interfaces for you. /etc/resolv.conf has the
locations of the DNS servers to use. For example, on my RH 7,3 box it has:

#search appl-ecosys.com aracnet.com
nameserver 192.168.55.1         #a.ns.appl-ecosys.com
#nameserver 216.99.193.1        #ns.aracnet.com
#nameserver 216.99.193.19       #ns2.aracnet.com
#nameserver 216.99.193.2        #ns3.aracnet.com

  I'm running a caching name server here so only the second line is active.
Prior to this, I used my ISP's name servers.

  Ah, we've all had these problems. Unfortunately, I don't know a solution
that's satisfactory to everyone or on all aspects. However, once you do get
set up again, other than security patches that apply to you you can just
keep using it.

  Firewall. Can't run naked without anticipating problems. You do lock your
front door when you leave at night, don't you? We can't complain about
getting run over if we walk down the middle of the road wearing dark clothes
on rainy nights.

  The WiFi saga is OS agnostic. It's the equipment. And the more you work
with the OS the more you learn. IMO, you can never become competent at
anything without practice or continual learning. Right now you're still on
the toe of the learning curve, but you've also been forced into paying more
attention than you did before. That's paying off both immediately and in the
future.

  Yup. It _would_ be easier with a local group offering hands-on help.
There's no question that close proximity communities make life a whole lot
easier. From the litte I've seen, PLUG is one of the premier user groups in
terms of offering high quality help to all in need.

  Skeet are not endangered. And, they are very tasty grilled. Particularly
with a wild rice stuffing. As for the chinook, these were no worse off than
the ones ODFW clubbed as they came out of the hatchery a couple of years
ago. The chinook are even better than skeet when grilled on a cedar plank.

  As the saying goes, give a man a fish and he has one meal. Teach a man to
fish and he sits in a boat drinking beer all day. I hope it was microbrew,
at least.

That's it! /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0. What do you use to
populate that if on a clean install the system doesn't offer to allow you
to set up networking? If I have to set up networking manually, what else
do I need to do?

You should see it from a distance... you've got an impressive group there
in Oregon.  I've been sampling a few other LUGs, and they all have
different "heads" if you know what I mean. I like PLUG; even the wingnuts
are amusing. In Boulder, we have BLUG, and I've been following that list
too, but they're either dead quiet or way over my head. Tonight they're
debating the ins and outs of wiring the home for ethernet, cat5/6 vs wifi,
WEP security and wardrivers and stuff that's as far out of my mental reach
as the Mars Rover is from my physical grasp.

At least when PLUG goes off on a tangent (like the current pistol-packin'
penguins thread) I can usually follow what's going on. Guns are easy; just
point and click. I could put a bullet through my elderly ethernet card
(and put us both out of our misery) a lot easier than learning how to make
it work with FC2, but why take the easy way out?

Bill,

  The 'netcfg' program should ask all the questions and write the answers to
the proper file. The ifcfg-eth0, tcp-wrappers in /etc/host* and
/etc/resolv.conf are all you need. Oh, you need to run
'/etc/rc.d/init.d/network start', too.

Funny, noone has complained about this posting which has absolutely no 
relevancy
to Linux administration or more generally, Unix issues.  I'm reminded of 
the HUD ad
on the radio where the Hispanic sounding guy is told there's no house 
for sale while a
Caucasian sounding caller is treated differently.  Is it possible that I 
took heat on the
MAD sco thread for a posting just like this one yet noone has treated 
Mr. Brelin with
equal disdain?  Just a thought.

Guns don't kill people, people kill people.  The hallmark of a free 
society is being able
to walk out your door without fear of being shot or maimed.

If you can fix the price of hardware or software, that's
a bad thing.  It's a clear sign of monopolistic practices.
The community conscious entrepeneur looks for ways
to lower the cost of computing for consumers.  There's
tremendous room for growth in the computer services
sector.  With more broadband, we are finally reaching
a point that providing information services in a
timely manner is becoming realistic.

One area I see great potential in is helping people filter
mail and web content.  Another area is providing
assistance with online research remotely.  Someone
lets you know what they want to do with open source
tools and you figure it out for them complete with an
explanation they can follow, for a reasonable fee.
Custom programming for people with a large online
conduit to deliver a product to them through is also
an interesting area.

I think everybody has accepted you can't stop Jeme from going off
topic... harping on him about it isn't going to do anything.  On the
other hand, if people remind me I'm drifting off-topic, I'll usually
start to veer back on topic and leave the thread alone...  :-)

Just out of curiosity, is there a project to stabilize legacy versions
of Redhat and minimize interoperability issues between Redhat
and other Linux distros?  I want to run maple 9.02 for Redhat 9
on the current gentoo, but I'm at a loss as far as what the graphical
version needs.  I'm thinking the c++ libraries are different, etc.
Is there a way to emerge the proper C++ libraries for this program
in gentoo and have it link to those without disrupting my existing
c++ library?  Is there a trick under Redhat 9 to figure out exactly
what maple9 graphical version is using?  I've had problems with
Redhat 9 locking up on my laptop where gentoo appears to not
have that problem.

For a server you might want to check out http://www.gentoo.org.

Windows XP is not magically secure, far from in fact.  Check out
http://www.grc.com.  I've never tried it, but running a Linux server
on a G3 or G4 might prove easier than using a PC.  There are a
lot of cheap G3's now.  Macs are designed to work with a custom
BSDish system in the first place, they should be Linux friendly.
I don't think G3's, maybe even G4's too, are very expensive on
E-Bay.  Heck, Linux can run on a playstation and you can
probably route through that.  Don't know if this helps, but I did
notice servers for sale at gentoo.org.  I'd say spend your $600
on a Linux specialist, not Microsoft Window XP.

That would be because (a) Jeme acknowledged that it was offtopic and
needed to go offlist, (b) both parties have some slack 'cos they are
generally helpful (or at least entertaining) and (c) neither party is
known for whiiining about the Topic Police.

Subject: [PLUG] Trying to configure dial up using wvdial...
Message-ID: <40E1410E.6050003@robinson-west.com>

I have a friend up in Toledo, Washington who I'm trying to set up a 
dial-up server for.

The phone number for her Internet service is 864-8888.  If anyone is 
local and can figure
out what the authentication method is, it would help.  I can dial that 
number from Scappoose
at 2 am, but it's long distance.  I have an XP home system with dial 
settings that got on
to Toledotel when I was up there last.  I'm tempted to ask how much DSL 
costs at her place
and suggest that she and her friend dump this dial-up service.  If it's 
around $20 a month,
that might be better.

Wvdial says it doesn't know what to do and waits for a prompt.  No 
prompt, it attempts
launching ppp, which produces an error about an LCP timeout.  If XP's 
dialer does
something special, it's a mystery to me.

Even Columbia Center which used to work with Redhat 6.2's wvdial 
evidently won't
now.  Maybe I'm just missing something.  Granted I don't have an account 
there
anymore, but I'm getting the same there's no prompt result.

Say what to your face?  Seems whatever Brelin says, it isn't taken 
seriously
even if it's extremely rude.  I doubt anyone would say, "It's all fun 
and games
'till...," to him.  So, why say that in all fairness to anyone else?

As far as topic police, I suspect you're in this category after electing 
yourself.
You're favoring one person's off topic posts over mine and attempting as far
as I can tell, to humiliate me.  At least I was only attempting to put 
the opposite
point of view up and not starting an off topic thread.  And looking at other
way off threads, I'm clearly not as good as some other people are at 
spinning a
yarn.

I see no value in trying to go to any more of these meetings if you're 
looking to
pick a fight.  Frankly, it's amazing that you feel threatened by posts 
to a public
email list which contain no threats.  Name calling perhaps, but no threats.
I was once told by a Linux instructor at PCC that this is a very whiny list.
I know some people have steered away from it because of this.  Jeme has
a bad reputation, but I don't see angry threads directed at him.  Clearly,
I'm being treated differently.  The name calling was a play on the thread
and shouldn't have been taken as aggressive, though I was tired of being
picked at by elitist, "his OT post is better than yours," snobs.

Maybe if there were more people who think the way I do posting,
the tone of the list would change.  The biggest problem with Portland
is a bias that's almost opposite the entire rest of the state.  
Unfortunately, the big cities have so much voting power.  I really wish
Portland, Eugene, and Salem would become their own state(s).  I don't
want to be in a state that includes them, these cities are so contrary
to what I believe and who I am.  This list proves that at least for
Portland.

Hmm... I don't have 'netcfg' on board. I just loaded mail, http, and ftp
servers in a text based installation, and so probably that wasn't
included. Do you know what RedHat rpm packages contain this program? I'd

: Bah.  If >I< went around telling everybody I was carrying, I'd get

I know it's OT - but this is FALSE!

Telling anyone and/or everyone that you are armed is NOT threatening!
(It is only disturbing to hoplophobes.) It is also -NOT- illegal and you would 
-NOT- be arrested unless you are carrying in a place or a manner which is 
proscribed by some -other- law. This would be like equating that 'you know 
how to use PGP' to mean 'I abet terrorists and criminals regularly.' (trying 
to stay close to topic...)

'Brandishing' means 'to shake or wave a weapon menacingly,' which is a clearly 
different act than merely carrying, even carrying open in a clearly 
conspicuous holster.

On FC2, netcfg's successor is /usr/bin/system-config-network.

I have a regular expression problem that I have not be able to solve with 
one
regular expression.  I can solve it with two but would like to use just 
one.

Problem description: A file that has multiple lines like the following 
(max ten lines):
"Detailed Test Description" testname "-d test-args more-test-args"

The problem is that the last set of args may not be there at all.
I need to match none, two or three fields and extract just the fields.
The match for the first two without the third is as follows:
^"([\s\S]*)"(?:\s+)(\S+)

The match for all three is as follows
^"([\s\S]*)"(?:\s+)(\S+)(?:\s+)"([\s\S]*)"

I would like to change the two into one search such that the
third search/match is optional and would not interfere with the first two
matches.  If necessary, I can change the format of the list since it is 
going into
one of my own programs.  (No this is not some class exercise)

This might not be the best but it is a starting point.  I hope someone can 
help me through 
this.

Thanks,

Fedora Legacy project, http://fedoralegacy.org/, provides security
updates for Red Hat Linux.

Running Red Hat packages on other distributions is another problem
entirely because few people care about using packages on other
distributions, especially ones with a different package management
scheme.  You will need to provide the dependencies manually.  Do a
"rpm -qp --depends package.rpm" to list the dependencies.  And then
try to get the right versions installed on your machine.

If that's exactly the kind of input that you're looking for, then you
don't want to write your own regular expressions.  Based on that regular
expression syntax, it looks like you're using Perl, and it turns out that
perl comes with a module for parsing exactly the kind of input data that
you're working with.

It's called Text::ParseWords, and if you type:

perldoc Text::ParseWords

on the command line it will bring up the documentation for you
to read.

Good luck!
Colin

Hiya,

I'm trying to get Mandrake 10.0 Official to auto install from the
floppy disk that I created at the very end of the install process.
I chose the "Replay" version over the "Automatic" version of auto
install.  When I try the auto install I boot from the install CD
and enter "expert auto_install=floppy" at the "boot:" prompt.  I
get the following on screen:

Entering step 'Language'
              'License'
              'Configure mouse'
              'Hard drive detection'
              'Select installation class'
              'Choose your keyboard'
              'Security'
              'Partitioning'
error :(
Oops, no root partition at /usr/bin/perl-install/install_steps.pm line 199.

Switch to console f2 for a shell
Press <Enter> to reboot



I have both a root "/" partition and a /home partition.  Anyone
here ever get an auto install to work with 10.0 Official?  

Thanks...

My hunch is that the problem isn't with RPM, but with your NFS export 
environment.

If you've got the default root_squash export setting, then root on the 
NFS client looks like user nobody to the server. If nobody can't read 
the exported files, then root on the client can't read them either.

The best solution is probably to make sure that the rpm repository on 
the nfs server is world-readable, e.g.,

   cd /root/of/repos
   find . -type d -exec chmod o+rx {} \;
   find . -type f -exec chmod o+r {} \;

I think I have the same model.  No real problems and have had six laptops
grabbing data thru the wireless and a couple systems through the wired.
It does seem to have a weak signal and the metal tiling in the bathroom
blocks the guest room, but that's the extent of my trouble.
My cable modem on the other hand...

What happens if you try to copy one of the RPMs from the NFS directory 
to a local directory?

This is what I have used to get this far.  I'm having trouble figuring
out the 'if-then-conditionals' needed to make it work in one search. 

I'll try it again later today if I get the time.

I export with no_root_squash.  Here's my /etc/exports

/home           joseph.somewhere.com(rw,no_root_squash)
/home           192.168.1.1(rw,no_root_squash)

I don't think that'll do the trick, but I'll try it.  I can copy 
files from the NFS dir to the local dir while root.  Is there 
anything specific to a firewall that would allow NFS file transfer, 
but disallow RPM install from the same NFS dir?  I do have a firewall
between machines on my LAN -- call me paranoid, but...

No error message.  It's just that nothing happens and I have to kill 
the process.

I can copy the RPM from the NFS dir to a local dir and then
install the RPM.  My goal is to use the NFS dir as a "media" for
Mandrake's urpmi.  I did add a media just fine.  But, installing
from it doesn't work because I can't even install an RPM in the
first place.

Thanks....

Then why not try this:

/^("[^"]+")\s*(\S+)?\s*("[^"]+")?/

^		Beginning of line
("[^"]+")	Find a bunch of characters that aren't quotes surrounded by quotes
\s*		Optional whitespace, in case you only have 1 argument on the line
(\S+)?		Optional second argument of non-whitespace
("[^"]+")?	Quoted sequence, optional

Curious indeed.

Have you tried adding several '-v' options when you install RPMs?  I
think that trick works with RPM, but I'm not sure.  Have you tried
querying the packages directly, just to make sure that RPM is able to
fully read them?

  Thanks, Wil. I know that's the name of the tool on Slackware but didn't
know it was named the same on Fedora.

  I'm completely fed up with Linksys and their outsourced tech support. I
just had their overseas techie tell me they don't support linux, only
winduhs. I told him that I'd then need to get an RMA for a refund and buy
someone else's products and that the linux community needs to know that they
don't know how to make a switch, for goodness sake!, work with linux.

  After sitting unplugged for more than a day I powered the unit up and I
can now access the admin page once again. This is too flaky for me. I will
get my money refunded and boycott Linksys until they either train their
Indian techies about linux or officially deign to support it.

  Any suggestions for alternative brands?

Thanks,

That shouldn't make any difference, since RPM is just going to read it 
like any other process. It doesn't open a network connection unless you 
give it a remote URL to an rpm.

Weird. Is the hard drive on the NFS server going during this time? How

Charlie,

  I _think_ I have a solution (after 45 minutes on the phone with a senior
support technician). I'm sending back this replacement unit and paying the
difference in price for a WAP54G. This new unit is only an access point, not
a switch, not an Internet router.

  While I was on hold I plugged in the unit and was able to access the admin
page. Then it cut out as I tried moving from one page to another. Then it
worked again. Phooey! Anyway, she finally understood the problem. And, in
what I thought was a rather nice touch, told me that indeed their products
do work with linux but the support folks are trained only on winduhs so they
don't know how to help.

  Stay tuned for further news. And thanks, everyone, for input, advice and
help. I hope the WAP54G is more reliable.

Of course.. it doesn't matter what OS you are using. I always pretend 
I'm using windows, to avoid that fight. "The icon says disconnected" 
when iwconfig sees no AP.
"Click what?, just tell me what you want to do, I know how"
Then tech support (hopefully) will ask you to check the signal strength, 
etc, instead of "click this, click that". Usually works with 1/2 way 
competent techs. Just tell them "nevermind" when they ask why you're 
typing so much :)

That almost got what I wanted.  Thanks, it pointed me in the direction I 
needed.
I didn't want the quote returned as part of the selected string.

Here is what I will be using:

/^"([^"]+)"\s*(\S+)?\s*"?([^"]+)?/

I didn't connect that the ? was to be after the expresion to make it 
optional.

Note to others:

    When you want help with regex, remember that ALL regex engines are
    NOT alike.  Please specify your engine and requirements.

Otherwise, we give Perl answers, pissing you off if you're not a Perl
user, and pissing us off for wasting time.

Also, PCRE is *not* Perl Compatible, in spite of the name.  So don't
confuse the two.

If you're going to use regular expressions, I'd recomment getting a
copy of Jeff Friedl's book, Mastering Regular Expressions.  It will
help your understanding a lot.

Also, the perlre and perlretut manpages do a good job of explaining
regular expression, but as Randal pointed out, they're perl specific.

That's according to the maxim:

Sort of.  Perl regex can include Perl code in the match (?{...}), so
unless PCRE embeds an entire Perl compiler, it cannot *ever* be
completely "perl compatible".

Those two statements together say "check the firewall logs" to me.  
Not that that explains why the `cp` NFS access would be different from 
the `rpm` NFS access.

Subject: [PLUG] BEFW11S4 woes
Message-ID: <20040629231229.GC9755@gate.kl-ic.com>

A while back, I did a crude characterization of the power supplies on a 
Linksys BEFW11S4, and on a WRT54G.  These devices use an internal power
supply regulator that is designed to draw constant power from the external
wall wart.  In engineer-speak, such regulators have "negative differential
resistance".  

The cheap-ass wallwarts that come with these units have quite a bit of
"positive differential resistance".  The result can be instability,
where in times of high extra load (say, when the unit is doing a lot of
computing, and reading and writing the EEPROM) the power supply can sag
into failure.  The Linksys wallwarts are speced at 12V/1A, while the
idling power of my BEFW11S4 is 3 watts.  However, I can imagine some
units might draw higher power, some wallwarts might be more resistive
and less capable, and the combination might sometimes fail. 

So, an expedient fix that may keep the unit sane is to clean the contacts
on the power supply plug.  If that doesn't help,  replace the wall wart
with a higher power, lower resistance one.  Anything between 12V and 18V
with a higher current rating should work.  The 12V 3.6A IBM thinkpad
chargers work fine, and it would be an interesting experiment to loan
one to Rich and see if it makes his BEFW11S4 less balky.

At the end of the day, these devices are cheap because they use very few
parts;  that should make them reliable.  On the other hand, some of the
parts are poorly tested, or not tested at all, and monster CMOS chips
like those found in the BEFW11S4 can be devilishly hard to test.  Note
that the same chips are used by most of Linksys's competitors.

All electronics, without exception, is flawed.  Fortunately, most of
the time the flaws are too subtle to detect, or too obvious to ignore.
However, there are some flaws that are on the spectrum between these
extremes, and it is very expensive to test something at a factory more
completely than months of usage will test it.  The really surprising
thing to me is that this stuff works as well as it does, given the 
tests that can be economically run on it.  Days of burn-in with cycling
racks, with continuous diags, will probably catch about 70% of the flaws.
But this would double the price, and would you pay 2X to reduce a 10%
chance of failure to 3% - especially if the average chance of "user
failure" is close to 50% ?   Most of us here are more attentive to
documentation and are better problem solvers, so our "user failure"
rates are closer to 10%, perhaps justifying more tested hardware.

Note that "refurbishment" for many manufacturers means running returned
units through testing, and putting the "no fault detected" units back in
the queue to send out as refurbs.   If the test is incomplete, then the
same unit may torment two or three users until somebody finally gives up
in frustration.  I think this is a shitty practice, but hey, if Microsoft
can do it and get away with it, why not the hardware guys?

Just a note, IIRC this one is a skeleton compared the the gui

One of the things I like about the text-only interface is that it gets 
me closer to the essentials of what's going on. Like driving a jeep with a 
stick shift, a text-only interface allows me to get stuck in more remote 
places. The lessons are harder, but once you learn, you have a much deeper 
appreciation for the knowledge. And once you know what files do or hold 
what, you can do things with a text editor you couldn't even dream of 
using someone else's GUI.

It's more of an aesthetic thing with me than a practical one. 

Ands thanks for pointing out this netconfig skeleton, Wil. It looks like 
that is what writes/modifies the ifcfg-eth0 file!

Something like:

    mount -t hpfs /dev/whatever /mnt/zip

Of course you have to have the right device driver loaded first, and
directory /mnt/zip must already exist.  And your kernel had to have
been built with HPFS support enabled.

I remember there being two drivers for parallel-port zip drives, ppa and
something else depending on the generation of the product. For IDE zip
drives you need the ide-floppy module. For USB you just need USB
mass storage. The USB driver should auto-load when you plug in the
device. For the other drivers you may have to manually load them with
the "modprobe" utility.

For parallel port and USB your device node will be a SCSI device. If
it happend to be the first SCSI device then the command would be:

    mount -t hpfs /dev/sda4 /mnt/zip

For the IDE floppy driver your device node would be an IDE node. If
it happened to be the third IDE device then the command would be:

    mount -t hpfs /dev/hdc4 /mnt/zip

Normally zip drives have a single partition #4. That's why sda4
or hdc4.

So the module is loaded but no HPFS in filesystem..

UUOC... errrr... UUOD (also, you need not be root for this):

$ grep zip /etc/fstab

And, I don't think you need to recompile your kernel; what does
"modprobe hpfs" cause to appear on your screen?  You'll potentially also
need to modify /etc/fstab

	      Greylisting and a Look at the Anti-Spam Landscape

				      by

				 Hal Pomeranz
			      <hal at deer-run.com>


       Black lists (both automated and not), white lists,
       keyword/regexp/Bayesian filters, SPF, and now "greylisting"-- where
       will the continuing anti-spam arms race take us next?  This talk
       includes an overview of current anti-spam techniques with some
       thoughts on their relative pros and cons, and a more in-depth look at
       the recently available "greylisting" technique, which is proving
       amazingly effective at blocking certain classes of spam.
    
       Hal Pomeranz is the technical lead and official spam eradicator for
       Deer Run Associates, a small consulting firm (recently relocated to
       Eugene, OR).  But this is merely his "mild-mannered secret identity"
       that hides his exploits as a Faculty Member and Senior Unix Instructor
       for the SANS Institute, Technical Advisor for the Center for Internet
       Security, and Technical Editor for Sys Admin Magazine.

I know I'm coming late to this party, but I've had solid performance from
my Netgear MR814v2 router.  I got it after returning about 3 Linksys
products, and it's connected one FreeBSD and 2 SuSE machines to the
internet without problems for almost a year now.

David,

  Many thanks. My need is for a wireless access point only. I don't need a
router, switch or hub. However, I have just purchased a Netgear FVS318
firewall/VPN/switch to replace the floppyfw box and its UPS. I need to learn
how to configure it.

  If Linksys Customer Support actually sends me the authorization form they
keep promising to send "Right Away!", I'll swap the BEFW11S4 for a WAP54G.

I recently bot an SMC Barricade g wireless router from Fry's to replace 
my Linksys.  Its a 200mW unit and at the time had a $40 rebate.  I liked 
it so much that I got an 6db gain SMC directional antenna that hooks 
right up ($29 with $10 rebate) and a 200mW wireless card 802.11b version 
($69 with $30 rebate) 

I now have coverage I only dreamed of before. 

Anyone want to buy a perfectly good linksys wireless card v.3?

I've had great luck with my
Lucent/Orinoco/who-the-hell-ever-they-are-this-week RG-1000, although I
don't know if they're still made and if so, they might be more expensive
than a LinkSys.

If your needs are as simple as mine, then all you need to do is write
the rules yourself (or use one of the utilities mentioned in the initd
script) and then use that initd script that tells you not to use it.

On a server with nothing but ssh and http, this is what I do:

iptables -F INPUT
iptables -P INPUT DROP # DON'T DO THIS OVER A NETWORK CONNECTION!
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

But don't blame me if that leaves you open to attack.

Great suggestion; I should have thought of that.

I did a little more digging.  rpm with -vv reported a bad signature on
the RPM I was using to test this problem.  On the machine where that
RPM is on a local disk (the one exported to the remote machine) the
signature checks just fine with rpm --checksig.  Indeed all signatures 
check fine on that machine.  But from the remote machine, the one
accessing RPMs via NFS, some signatures check as bad.  The machine
where the RPMs were built uses rpm-4.0.4-19mdk, and runs Mandrake 9.0
on a Pentium I.  The machine that reports as bad uses rpm-4.2.2-7mdk,
and runs Mandrake 10.0 on a Celeron.  When the remote machine sees
the signature as good, then installing it appears to be no problem.

Does the signature "goodness" difference make sense to anyone?  It 
does not compute for me.

Thanks again...

This is simple, but having survived a crack a few years back, I can
attest that it is CRITICAL to block outgoing connections as well. IRC is
a good start, since crackers use IRC to advertise their conquests. If
the machine isn't supposed to send email, MAKE SURE it can't! Even
though we all learned how to trick a machine into mailing its passwd
file out (back when no one used MD5 passwords in a shadow file), no one
seems willing to lock that down on a utility machine. 

If the server is web-only but has to send email (and you have another
server for email), allow email to be sent only to/through your mail
server.  The rootkits like to send email direectly to leave fewer
footprints, and this will block them.

Basically, allow only traffic you know you want. Allowing all outgoing
traffic has bitten me, and will probably bite you too.

Thanks Wil,

Heh, right above the "old" directory on the LMbench download area is an 
alpha version 3.0. 2.0.4 is also available. It appears both are from 
January, 2003. Is the alpha any good, or should I stick with the release 
version?

That would be badblocks, which can do a read-only or a destructive
write-read-verify test.  It'll even do a nondestructive read-write-
read-verify-restore cycle so it puts the data back when it's done.

You can tell e2fsck to do a readonly badblocks scan with the -c option
and a nondestructive write-read test with -cc.  
Takes a loooong time, though.

And yes, the SMART tools can tell you a bit about what the drive thinks
about its own health.  But we all know how accurate self-assessments can
be...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0406301314370.9174@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  The bottom line: don't buy Linksys!

  Over a 3-day period I've spoken with five different drones at Linksys
Customer Service. The first two promised to e-mail the authorization form
for me to pay the difference in product prices (from the BEFW11S4 to the
WAP54G). Nothing arrived.

  This morning I call again (I think their so-called customer service is
outsourced overseas) and voice #3 tells me she'll send it right out. I tail
the mail log and sure enough, in a couple of minutes the authorization
message is in my inbox. So, I fill it in according to the directions and
send it back to the reply address, "customerservice at linksys.com".

  Only a few seconds later I get a MAILER-DAEMON bounce message in my inbox:
from the mail server at cisco.com: "550 We ain't got no user named
'customerservice'". Nice, eh? So, I call again and get drone #4. Her name,
she tells me, is Jan. After giving her both RMA numbers, the case number, my
phone number and e-mail address (all this for the fourth time, of course), I
finally manage -- by speaking very slowly and clearly -- that I cannot
return their authorization because the username does not exist. There is no
'customerservice at linksys.com'. I think she understands. She asks me to wait
while she checks this out. After 20 minutes on hold listening to very poor
quality Muzak(R) or whatever they use, I hang up and have lunch.

  After lunch I call back and speak with 'Dale' (four female voices and one
mail voice). I ask to speak with a supervisor, manager or Vice President,
whichever is available Right Now. Wait on hold. Dale comes back on the line
and asks, "Why do you want to speak with a supervisor?"

  "Because I cannot return the authorization you sent me. There is no user
named 'customerservice' at linksys.com. The mail server at cisco.com bounced
your message to me."

  "Oh. Please wait." Some time later Dale's back on the line. "Yes. That is
not a valid username. You need to send the authorization to
rma at linksys.com."

  "Why wasn't this the return address on the authorization message you sent?
Hold on ... I'm forwarding the reply I sent to customer service. OK. I'm
tailing the mail log and it tells me that the server at cisco.com replied
with the 250 code, accepting the message for delivery. Do you have it yet?"

  Finally, he has the message and we've passed this hurdle.

  If this is what customer service is in the modern computer company, look
out! Will I ever buy another Linksys product? Not me. What a PITA!

I had a substantially similar experience with VMware customer support,
even to the point where they wouldn't give me over to a supervisor.  (That
should ALWAYS be an option.)

I finally got a response by sending a politely worded message to their
sales/marketing E-mails gleaned from the web page.  In fact, the response
was pretty darn quick.  I had someone call me about 30 minutes after I
sent the message.

Linksys should know why you're moving on.  Maybe they'll think twice about
their current customer support arrangements.

Frustrating? Yes.

Unfortunately, many companies have done away with the user 
"customerservice" and "support" because those get spammed 
horrendously... I was reading an article in eWeek today that said that 
spam has increased to 65% of the email on the net.

Why wasn't it the return address? Because data miners will see the 
return address, and start spamming the return address.

Somewhere, either coming from the mouth of one of the people you spoke 
with, or embedded in the form, should have been instructions on where to 
send the form back.

Subject: [PLUG] Parsing HTML with Perl
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0406301434540.24252@neon.netpro.to>

I'm trying to use Perl to parse out "records" from an HTML page.  I'm able
to identify the beginning of a record with the following tag:

<TABLE border=0 width=500 class='A'>

or

<TABLE border=0 width=500 class='B'>

...but I have no obvious way to find the end of a record except by the
next starting tag.  There could be numerous additional table tags embedded
in a record so I can't do anything simple like this:

@records = /<TABLE border=0 width=500 class=.+?>(.*?)<\/TABLE>/g;

Does anyone have a suggestion for how to pull everything between each
occurance of these beginning tags?  I realize I'll end up losing the last
record, but I'll deal with that later.
Thanks,
~M

Russ,

  I read recently (perhaps in The Economist) that spam is now 83% of all
mail traffic. I suppose it all depends upon whom you ask and what day it is.

  Regardless, this whole process has taken a _lot_ of time and been very
unsatisfactory. Even if they generated a new e-mail name each day, they
should ensure that when they require a response we peons can actually get
the response back to them.

Have you tried using HTML::Parser? It should be included with
Fedora/RedHat and will probably work a lot better than just using
regular expressions.

Today's number for me: 78% has been spam.  If we take Plug traffic out of
the equation, we rise to 97% spam.

This is the best easy solution.

An alternative would be to run the HTML through tidy[1] and use a 
full-fledged XML parser to grab your data, which would probably allow 
you a bit more flexibility than HTML::Parser.

Here are my numbers from home:

           total   caught
     month  msgs     spam   %
   ------- -----   ------  --
   2004-01  5746     1494  26
   2004-02  5377     1866  34
   2004-03  5189     2339  45
   2004-04  5557     2812  50
   2004-05  5530     2738  49
   2004-06  6029     3008  49

The "caught spam" numbers are a bit lower than total spam, but for the 
last three or four months (since I implemented a better bayesean 
policy) only 50-75 messages per month have slipped through 
spamassassin.

Anecdotally, I'd say that the numbers are roughly similar at work, but 
I don't have any hard data to back up that hunch.

Any suggestions on how I would use HTML::Parser to do this?  Actually,
let's pretend it's not HTML...  It's just a text file with some unique
line of text that separates each record.  Anything and everything could
occur between the record separators and I want to save it all to a
variable.  Hmm...  Maybe I'll just use split() and remove the garbage from
the first array element...

You could use Text::Balanced or Parse::RecDescent or something similar.
There are lots of generic text parsing modules.

You could... it'll be slow and consume much memory.

Lucent/Orinoco/who-the-hell-ever-they-are-this-week finally got bought by 
Proxim and AFAIK all that era of wireless devices are phased out.  The

I have some documents that I acquired on a system that uses Digital

P.S. IS there a way to get any Linux distro to recongize a CD burnder

repcognize my printer (no surprise -- USB color inkjet) but also 
wouldn;t recongize my DVD player drive as such or ym DVD Recorder drive

What's significant to me is not the percentages, but that the raw numbers 
of spam are increasing. What do we do when there's so much spam coming in 
that it amounts to a DOS attack?

Or perhaps the rise you're seeing is really due to better filters? I was
keeping track of it up to about the first week of June, and my load is
pretty steady now at about 130-150 per day, which is actually down from
about 170/day in March and April. It's roughly 2/3 spam now.

Isn't it essentially a sustained DoS attack now?  It's requiring
companies set up more servers just to deal with the spam, spend
countless man-hours working to solve it, and some will end up not being
able to process email as fast as it comes in.

It seems like an ever-increasing DoS attack to me.

I think better filters lead to more spam but less spam making it to
those behind the better filters.

BTW, it looks like Evolution is now implementing some Bayesian filters.
I've thus far just ignored them, but found it interesting they're there.

Michael,

  What, specifically, is the DRM software? Acrobat with security features
enabled?

  This is a generic enough question it belongs to the public response
category.

  The immediate solutions are to transfer the data files to your linux box
and use a tool to run the reader you have. VMware, win4lin and Wine are all
possibilities. A long term solution is a reader that works on native linux.

  I've been burning cdroms for years; Red Hat 4.1-7.3 and now Slackware
8.1-9.1. I don't know of a distribution that won't. It's the tools, not the
distribution that matters. The two you want are 'mkisofs' and 'cdrecord'.
There are also multiple GUI front ends for them.

  If you don't have a SCSI cd writer then you have to enable SCSI emulation
in the kernel. For DVD you may need more up-to-date tools than you currently
have. Others will need to address that as I don't do DVDs. My notebook has
the drive; I don't have the desire or need.

  Tech Tip

   If you have configured your wireless access point to allow only your own
   systems to connect, you can test your configuration without borrowing a
   forbidden card. Use the hw ether command-line argument to ifconfig to set
   your wireless card to a different MAC address. An example script using
   this technique can be seen here: http://yak.net/fqa/327.html.

   The script shows that it's important not to rely only on MAC address
   checking to secure your wireless network, because an informed attacker
   can spoof an allowed MAC address.

   More information is available on the ifconfig man page.

Just a simple request, Friends.

I would appreciate it if you do decide to dismember these little
puppies, please bring the leftover bits back to Free Geek for proper
disposal. I doubt if we will make much on each one when they are
recycled, but every little bit helps. And I want to get you guys into
the habit of bringing your castoff stuff to Free Geek.

Greetings:

This file will explain exactly how to add Linux to your computer, while
leaving Windows in place, giving you what is known as a "dual boot
system". This is an easy, but time consuming process. It uses Knoppix,
which is the easiest Linux distribution (there are many different
distributions of Linux) to get running and we consider

The steps described here that are done in Windows are pretty much the
same between Windows 98, Windows 98SE, Windows ME, Windows 2000, and
Windows XP. The differences for these particular tasks are so minor, you
should be able to figure them out with no problem. I do recommend that
you read through these instructions before trying this, so you can be
clear on what steps you are going to take.


* Prerequisites:

- A minimum of 3 GBytes of hard drive space, 128 MBytes of RAM, and a
400 MHz Pentium processor.

- Backup all data you want to keep off of your Windows partition.
Although this process is almost always safe, there is still the off
chance that it will damage your Windows partition. Better safe than
sorry!

- A copy of Knoppix 3.4-2004-05-17. You can download a 640 MB ISO image
for a CD-ROM at http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html and then
burn that to a CD-ROM. These instructions are ONLY for this specific
version - they will be updated when a new version is available.

- Two blank floppy disks (if your computer has a floppy drive).


* Preparing Your Windows Computer:

1. Put the Knoppix CD in your CD-ROM drive and reboot. It *should* start
up Knoppix and run it from the CD-ROM. It will be slow, but it should
work properly. If it doesn't then you should STOP and try to figure out
what is wrong before proceeding. Once you are satisfied that Knoppix
works correctly, click on the left-most icon on the Knoppix task bar,
select "Logout..." and then select "Restart computer" and click OK.
There will be a bunch of messages as your computer reboots, with the
final message being, "Please remove CD, close cdrom and hit return."
When you do that, the computer will restart into Windows.

2. After Windows restarts, click on "My Computer" and then right click
on the C drive and select "Properties". Next, click on the button "Disk
Cleanup..." and the "Disk Cleanup" tabbed page will appear. There are a
series of checkboxes in a frame, select everything EXCEPT "Compress old
files" and click on OK. If your files are not compressed, you will be
able to access them from within Linux. At this point, you should have at
least 3.0 GB free on your hard drive - if not, STOP now.

3. Select the "Tools" tab and click the "Check Now..." button. A dialog
box will pop up, select "Automatically fix file system errors" and
deselect "Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors", then click
"Start". Another dialog box will pop up that starts with something like,
"The disk check could not be performed..." Click on "Yes" and then
restart your computer.

4. After Windows restarts, click on "My Computer" and then right click
on the C drive and select "Properties" again. Select the "Tools" tab
again and this time, click the "Defragment Now..." button. The Disk
Deframenter application should start and your C drive should be
selected. Click on the "Defragment" button and the defragmentation
process will start. This will take a loooooong time. When it is done, a
dialog box will appear with the statement, "Defragmentation is complete
for: (C:)" and you should click on the "Close" button.

5. Now go back to "My Computer" and right click on the C drive and
select "Properties". Select the "Tools" tab and click on "Backup
Now...", which will open the Backup dialog. Click on the "Emergency
Repair Disk" icon. Select the checkbox to backup the registry and then
click "OK". When its done, pop out the disk and label it as the dialog
box asks and then click on "OK" and close all the various open windows.

6. Put Knoppix back into the CD-ROM drive and restart your computer.


* Installing Linux

7. Once Knoppix has started, click on the icon on the toolbar that looks
like a monitor. A command line shell will start and you should enter,
"su". This will put you into "superuser" mode (distinguished by the "#"
prompt as opposed to the normal "$" prompt). Enter "knoppix-installer"
and a dialog box will pop up - just click on "OK". Another dialog box
will appear that starts with "The installer detected that the
installation requirements are not fulfilled yet..." Click on "OK" and
the Knoppix Partition-Menu will appear.

8. Select "1. Partition Partition the hard disk" and click on OK. This
will start the Linux program qtparted. Click on the Expand button, which
is the second button from the right on the title bar. Then select
"/dev/hda" under "Disks" on the left side; this will show you how much
space is used on that drive. Right click on the first partition, which
should be /dev/hda1, and select "Resize".

9. Click on the drop down box next to the label "Free Space After:" that
says "MB" and change it to "GB" (gigabytes). Change the "0.00" value to
whatever amount you want (at least 3.00) and then click "OK". The hda1
display will change from yellow to red, to indicate that something has
changed, but has not been saved.

10. Highlight the line that starts with "02" and right click, then
select "Create". A "Create partition" dialog box will pop up and change
the "Create as:" dropdown to "Extended Partition", select the "Position"
radio group and the "End of unallocated space" radio button. Change the
"Size:" value to double the size of your RAM (for 128 MB RAM, the value
should be 256 MB) and click "OK". Select the "02" entry in the partition
table again with a right click and select "Create" again. This should
create an "ext3" type of 100% of the remaining space. Now select "04" in
the partition table and right click and select "Create" and change the
"Partition Type:" to "linux-swap" and click OK.

11. Click the Disk icon on the tool bar (or menu File|Save). When the
process complete, the Progress popup dialog will say "Operations
completed sucessfully" and you can click on the "OK" button and then
close the qtparted application with "File|Quit".

12. At this point, the Knoppix installer will appear and you can
configure your installation. Highlight the first option ("Configure
Installation") and click on "OK". A dialog box will appear with three
system types to choose from. Select "beginner" and click on "Next". The
next dialog box will ask you which partition to install Knoppix on (most
of the time this is "/dev/hda3"), select the largest partition (Windows
won't show up on this list, so don't worry) and click on "Next".

13. A dialog box now asks, "Input your whole name (name surname)". Enter
your name into the text box as you want it to appear - remember that you
will see this first each time you start Linux. Be neat and tidy or you
will get annoyed later. Click "Next". This then brings up a dialog box
that says, "Input your user name" and makes a suggestion. You should
change this to something like your standard email name (without the @
and the stuff following) and then click "Next". The next dialog asks,
"Input your user-password" with one text box and then, "Input your
user-password again". Put the same password into each text box; we
recommend a mixture of numbers and letters at least 6 chars long. Now
click "Next" again.

14. Next, a dialog box asks for your administration password. This
password should be different from your user password. This should be
definitely be longer and more obscure than your user password. Once you
have entered it twice (just like with your user password), click "Next".

15. This is where you specify your computer name. It is VERY important
that this name be different than any other computer on your local area
network (if you have a LAN). Once you have a good choice, click "Next".

16. Now you much choose where the boot loader goes. Select "mbr" (for
"Master Boot Record") and then click "Next".

17. You should now be back at the main installation window. Select "2.
Start installation" and click "OK". A summary screen describing your
configuration should appear. Check this over carefully and hit
"Previous" if you need to change something or "Next" if it all seems OK.
A progress dialog will appear and you can go get a cup of coffee, if you
like.

18. A dialog box will now ask you to put an empty floppy disk into the
drive. Put it in and click "Yes". Various messages will appear on the
console and a dialog will appear and say "Knoppix was successfully
installed to hd." Click "OK" and eject the floppy drive.

19. Click the K menu on the left of the tool bar and select "Logout...",
followed by "Restart computer" and "OK".

20. When the system restarts, a splash screen will come up with the
different boot options. Use the <DownArrow> key to highlight your
Windows entry. The splash screen will also have a kind of scary title
above the options, saying "debian GNU/Linux unstable 'Sid'". Do not be
alarmed by that, the "unstable" title refers to the release level.
"Unstable" Linux is *far* more stable than Windows. Hit the "Enter" key
to start Windows, so we can verify that everything is working right
there and to make another recovery disk.

21. When Windows restarts, it will first check your filesystem, since it
knows you have changed the size. Let this run to completion and the
system will reboot, select Windows again and restart again. Once you
have logged in, Windows will pop up another message that says, "Do you
want to restart your computer now?". Go ahead and say "Yes" and reboot
yet again.

22. Go back to step 5 and redo your Emergency Repair Disk. Put that away
in a safe place and then restart your computer, this time starting
Linux.

23. I like to have a tidy desktop on my computer, if not in real life.
To do that, right click on your desktop and select "Icons" and then
"Line Up Horizontally" and then do that again, but this time, "Line Up
Vertically". Right click again and select "Configure Desktop...". Here
you can change some of the look and feel, including the desktop
background, which is in German (most annoying if you don't speak
German). Click on "Background" on the left tool bar, then select the
Background Picture from the list (I happen to like "only_k" best, but
that's just me). Make any other changes, such as "Screen Saver" and then
click "OK".

* Updating Your Linux System

24. Just like any software, Linux needs to have updates loaded and new
software added. In order to make that easier, we have created some
script files that will do just that for you. Open a web browser (there
are two on the tool bar - I happen to like Konqueror the best, which is
the icon with the globe inside the gear) and go to
http://www.freegeek.org/??????. Download these files by clicking and
saving them: update-sources.sh, install-collab-base.sh, and
install-non-free.sh.

25. Open a terminal window and type "ls". This will show you the three
files. Type "su", which will make you the SuperUser (root), and then
enter your administration password.

26. When you get the "#" prompt, type:

	sh ./update-sources.sh

27. This will go out to the Internet to pick up all of the updates since
the Knoppix CD was created on May 17, 2004. A LOT of text will scroll by
as it downloads all of the catalogs of potential updates (but not the
updates themselves) until, finally, a prompt says "Do you want to
continue? [Y/n]". Hit <Enter> and the hundreds of updated packages will
now be downloaded and installed.

28. After all of the updates are all downloaded, there will be a series
of prompts which require your interaction. The first of these (usually)
is for cpuburn. The opening line is "cpuburn is dangerous for your
system" and goes on to describe the horrible things that can come from
running this program. This is a program for system testing of your CPU.
Click on "OK" to continue, since there is no reason for you to ever run
this program.

29. You will be prompted at least three times for different files that
will be replaced, with the default always being "No". For the files
/etc/pcmcia/config.opts and /etc/pcmcia/config, you should answer "N"
(or just hit <Enter>). For /etc/menu-methods/menu.h, you should answer
"Y". Other updated files, you will need to determine for yourself
(probably also "Y").

30. Right at the tail end, an error is encountered, "Looking for keymap
to install: NONE" and "Errors were encountered while processing: joe",
that can easily be recovered from. Just enter the command "apt-get -f
install" at the "#" prompt. This will force the install to finish and
correctly install joe. This is NOT a problem.

31. Once you are back at the "#" prompt, you need to be make sure that
YPbind and YPserv do not start. Execute the following line to disable
these services without removing that capability:

	mv /etc/defaultdomain /etc/defaultdomain.old

32. There are some important software packages missing from Knoppix and
there is a shell script provided to go out to the Internet to get and
install them. This batch is actually larger and will take *longer* than
the updates you just installed, so be patient. The most important of
these packages is Gnome, which will add many capabilities - plus a whole
new window manager - to your system. To run this, type:

	sh ./install-collab-base.sh

33. The initial determination of what files need to be loaded for this
happens fairly quickly and will present you with the message, "Do you
want to continue? [Y/n]". Hit <Enter> and hundreds of new packages will
be downloaded and installed.

34. Next, you will see a message screen asking what paper size to set as
default. Use you <UpArrow> and <DownArrow> keys to select "USletter" and
then hit <Enter>. The next message screen will ask, "Use nautilus-media
as default video thumbnailer?" and you should just hit <Enter> again.
Yet another message screen will tell you that you will need to restart
your applications after installation before things look really nice.
Again, just hit <Enter>. After a bunch more packages are loaded, a
Binary Code License Agreement from Sun Microsystems will display, asking
if you want to load Java - and yes, you do. Enter "Q" and then type in
"yes" to the question, "Do you agree to the above license terms? [yes or
no]" (assuming you do agree). At the tail end, you will see a "WARNING"
message which is not significant for this installation.

35. Once you get the "#" again, you can add packages to be able to
handle the proprietary audio and video files, such as Windows
MediaPlayer and RealPlayer. To get these programs, type in:

	sh ./install-non-free.sh

36. Hit <Enter> when you see the "Do you want to continue? [Y/n]"
prompt. The Real Player installer package will put up a message screen
with the prompt, "Would you like to run the Real Player installer now?"
Highlight the "Yes" response and hit the <Enter> key. A prompt will show
the string "Please visit
http://scopes.real.com/real/player/unix/unix.html" with some further
instructions. Follow these instructions to download the package from the
Internet and save it in the /tmp directory. When you have completed the
download, change the path requested by the prompt, "Real Player has been
downloaded to where?" from /root to /tmp and then hit <Enter>. To the
question on the next message screen, "Delete RPM file once it is
installed?", select "Yes" and hit <Enter>. Some more text will scroll by
and then the same messages screens will appear once more. Just answer
the questions the same way and you are now able to create MP3 files from
your music CDs and to listen to proprietary format multimedia files.

37. Now that everything is updated, please delete the three files with
the command (you should do this so things don't get executed twice):

	rm update-sources.sh install-collab-base.sh install-non-free.sh.


* Optional Step - Make Windows The Default

38. Although Linux is the most wonderful thing since sliced bread, some
people still want to boot into Windows as their default operating
system. To make that happen, open a terminal window (the Monitor icon on
the tool bar. Type "su" and enter your administration password. When you
get the "#" prompt enter "vim /etc/lilo.conf".

39. Vim is a very weird text editor. It can be very scary, even to an
experienced Linux user. Please follow these steps exactly. Use the
<PageDown> key to slowly scroll through the file until you see a line of
text that says:

	default="Linux"

40. Scroll down until you see the entry for Windows. It will look
something like this:

	other=/dev/hda1
		label="WinXP/2K(hda1)"

41. Write down *EXACTLY* what the quoted string says! It will be
different for different versions of Windows!

42. Use the <UpArrow> to return the cursor to the line that says
"default="Linux", position your cursor on top of the second quote mark
("), and press the "i" key. This puts vim into Insert mode. Delete the
"Linux" string (but not the quote marks) and then enter the label you
wrote down *EXACTLY* like you found it (e.g., "WinXP/2K(hda1)").

43. Hit the <ESC> key (which takes vim out of Insert mode) and then
enter ":x", which saves the file and exits.

44. Back at the # prompt, enter the command "lilo" and you now have
Windows as your default operating system.

45. Reboot your computer just to make sure. Remember that your Knoppix
startup disk (and your Windows Emergency Repair Disk) can usually get
you back if things get too bad.

46. Enjoy your new Linux system. Explore away!

Having a brother who's worked in contract tech support I can say:
bleah. Most of the time, when you talk to a "supervisor" all you're
doing is talking to another tech with no more power than the first
one, while you "cool off" and get transfered right back to where you
were.

Everyone whines about spam, I get like 4, maybe 5 a week and a couple from
Prince Mugkrubo. I haven't set up a filter because I haven't seen the need
to. I've had this domain and email for about a year. 

The main thing I do is to create a special email for each company I give my
email address to - i.e. netflix at loraksus.org or visa at loraksus.org, as soon
as one of these asshole companies sell my email, I kill the addy and bitch
and moan incessantly to the company (I'm unemployed, it's fun screwing up
the AHT of phone monkeys while eating fudge striped cookies). 
"Don't sign up for stupid shit" is also a great way of not getting spam. 

/Of course, now somebody is going to post this email on the web and I will
get 1000s of spams a day. . . 

On a side note, dlink support is about as useless as linksys but the kicker
is that they are 24-7 and extremely fun to call when you are just about to
pass out from consumption of massive amounts of alcohol. Vonage support is
bloody useless, but I've ranted about that before and there isn't a need to
repeat my angst. I've actually spoken to a couple people at dlink who
weren't brain dead, but my experiences with linksys have always been with
someone who would find it intellectually challenging working at burger king.

Here are my numbers from home:

           total   caught
     month  msgs     spam   %
   ------- -----   ------  --
   2004-01  5746     1494  26
   2004-02  5377     1866  34
   2004-03  5189     2339  45
   2004-04  5557     2812  50
   2004-05  5530     2738  49
   2004-06  6029     3008  49

The "caught spam" numbers are a bit lower than total spam, but for the 
last three or four months (since I implemented a better bayesean 
policy) only 50-75 messages per month have slipped through 
spamassassin.

Anecdotally, I'd say that the numbers are roughly similar at work, but 
I don't have any hard data to back up that hunch.
