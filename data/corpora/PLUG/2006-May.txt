Yes there are. Anything based on a Genesys Logic USB-IDE chip will fail. 
I bought several external cases to use for backup based on this chip and 
the transfer would fail after transferring only a few hundred megs. 
Sometimes the failure would result in the drive disappearing, sometimes 
it would just stream errors continuously (hundreds and hundreds of megs 
in a few minutes).  There was a work around but it resulted in such poor 
transfer rates that I bit the bullet and purchased a case with a 
different chipset (sorry, can't remember which one right now...). No 
more problems. I now regularly transfer 50+ GB of data with out error.

I've only used two 'prebuilt' usb drives: 1 Seagate and one Western 
Digital. Both work fine. No errors. No problems. I use another

You are right you have several options.  If you already have Ethernet
connectivity
between the two locations just break-out pair #4 from the cable, connect your
phone line to it and connect your phone at the other end.  200ft is
well within the spec
distance for 100base t of 100 meters.  You would not need DSL to do this unless
you want to slow your network speed down or wanted to experiment by running
making your network and phone work on the same pair. If you want to do that
I would recommend the following link:
http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20010823.html

If you decide that you don't want to do DSL then sell them on eBay or
re-cycle them at freegeek.

You'd be better off with Long-range ethernet, if you're buying gear. But
200 ft is fine for ethernet, 100bT only requires 4 wires.

Also, you can put two cisco 678's on both sides if you really want. (no
DSMLAM needed)
Assuming the phone line isn't going through the phone company.. because
if it is, that won't work, unless you can get a "raw" circuit (normally
used for security systems, and costs $$$). If you have raw wiring
between the two, just use ethernet.

                             MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT

                        The Portland Linux/Unix Group
                                  will meet
                          7 PM Thursday May 4, 2006
                                      at

                                VectorSection
                     (previously known as: UberConverter)
       Open Source File Format Translation for CAD and Vector Graphics

                                      by

                                 Eric Wilhelm
                         <scratchcomputing at gmail.com>
 
      VectorSection uses concepts such as "small pieces, loosely joined" 
      to inform the design of a set of transparent and simple-yet-capable
      interconnected tools for manipulating and translating 2D and 3D 
      vector graphics data between multiple common and uncommon file 
      formats.

      Learning how this system is put together has applications not 
      just to vector graphics, but to data translation/migration in 
      general.

      This presentation will cover the basics of CAD/vector graphics
      interoperability issues and details about how VectorSection allows 
      for ad-hoc extension in any programming or scripting language.
      
      Note:  I have been told that CNN is in town doing a story on 
      Open Source Software in Portland.  Maybe they will come to our
      meeting.  Better yet, they should go to the Lucky Lab after the
      meeting.

Hi all! I am currently thinking about setting up a machine to act as a
failover "Sorry nobody is home!" web server during planned outages. I am
wondering what the  limit is on virtual interfaces. I currently have 30
configured and can ping them locally.

Why I can't respond to locking up, on my specific system (I'm running SuSE
v10 Professional) I've had no trouble backing up my ISOs of Linux distros
and my library of MP3s to my USB drive (other than running out of space on
my USB drive <grin>).  I've got about 8 Gb of MP3s and 60+Gb of ISOs that
I just completely re-backed up over the weekend (deleted all hte files off
the USB drive and copied with cp -R . /media/....).  Other commands
probably would have been better, but it also exercised the heads on my
drive heavily.

cnt=0

   for b in `seq 1 255`; do
      for c in `seq 1 255`; do
         for d in `seq 1 255`; do

            ifconfig eth0:$cnt $a.$b.$c.$d;

      done
   done
done


I'm not seeing a limit so far, so I think you'll be ok.  ;-)

PAGE_SIZE is 4096.  I think you're probably fine with 32768 virtual interfaces.

Indeed.  2.6.17 already merged the basic softmac stack and Broadcom
driver, so the next step will be to merge Devicescape's work.

FWIW, this has almost exactly zero to do with Atheros wifi devices.
Madwifi folks, as far as it is possible to tell, are not cooperating
with the linux wifi convergence.  They seem content going their own
way.

Subject: [PLUG] Thunderbird behavior
Message-ID: <4457D2E9.5040709@comcast.net>

With t-bird version 1.0.6 (20050716), when I start the program it opens 
with the inbox displayed. With the new version (1.5.0.2) it opens with 
the top level display for the e-mail user unless I check the box 
labeled, "Check for new messages at startup". On one of my machines I 
never want to read mail. I just installed t-bird for the convenience of 
sending mail from that machine. On another machine I never want to 
automatically download mail, since I want to prescreen it with the 
Comcast web-mail service.

Do any of you t-bird users know some other place from which startup 
behavior is controlled and/or what you call this "feature"?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <1146601250.4457bf2288b78@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I noticed this extra scanner was lying around and thought, "will this
work on my Fedora Core 3 system?"  Well, I haven't been able to get it
to work on my D845PEBT2 motherboard.

I got the scanner to do something a few times using the umax_pp tool, but
I can't seem to get that to work again.  It looks like I'm running into
EPP doesn't work errors.  I put the paraller port in EPP mode in the bios.  
I'm wondering if parport even works with this scanner and how to get around 
it if it doesn't?

My google research lead me to compile and install sane-backend-1.0.14 with
a patch, umax1220p-6.3.gz.  There is a newer sane-backend, 1.0.17, but I
don't know if support for this scanner is out of beta yet.

Is there a grub option or something that I need to make my EPP port work
in EPP mode?

Here is uname -a output:
Linux eagle.robinson-west.com 2.6.12-1.1381_FC3 #1 Fri Oct 21 03:46:55 EDT 2005

Well, yeah, that's a possibility too.  And just yesterday I got to 
reading about those new-fangled 750GB drives from Seagate, and about 
eSATA, which I wasn't familiar with.  Of course, I don't think I *need* 
750GB ... um, this year.  :-)  So I guess I'll look around a bit more 
and consider the options.

Fry's, though ... I don't think I can get there on TriMet.  At least, 
when I tried to enter the address, I kept getting error messages.  I 
dont' know where Wilsonville is (except on a map), but it doesn't seem 
like it's easily accessible via public transport.

There's a preference pane item (Edit=>Preferences) under "General" 
called "Thunderbird Start Page" (which, IMO, is an odd thing to call it, 
just 'cause I don't think of an email program as having "pages" in the 
same way, say, a web browser does -- but whatever).  I have never 
changed that setting from the default, but that should be where you can 
control what Tbird shows on start-up.  The default on my install is:

chrome://messenger/content/start.xhtml

As for connecting and downloading mail, that's done on a per account 
basis, so you need to go to Edit=>Account Settings and adjust the server 
settings from there.  It's the same setting you mention -- "Check for 
new messages at startup."

The Tri-Met website says that the closest stop to Fry's is 2 miles
away.. so if you enjoy walking through some nightmare vision of suburban
hell I'm sure you'd like the trip to Fry's.  But I'm biased against
suburbia.. and I'd personally rather eat glass than go to Fry's.  I'm
sure you can find someplace that's not several hours away and/or online
which has a similar product.

For what it's worth,  since I worked in Wilsonville for a number of
years... Wilsonville has a
completely separate public transit system.  I think there are a couple
of points where you could
transfer from Trimet to the Wilsonville system, but it wouldn't surprise
me if Trimet's web
site didn't have any special listing for them.

Any other First Tech Credit Union customers here?  They shut down
from April 28 through March 1, to bring up a new web interface.  It
came up today (Tuesday), and was very slow.  It seems to be Internet
Explorer specific, and less capable than the old web interface.  It
did not receive much independent testing.

I am told the annual meeting is coming up soon.  If the interface is
still busted at that time, I plan on making a stink.  Anyone else
want to join in?

Here is an email correspondence I had with their support staff.

I do appreciate the speedup, thank you.  However, if the prior history
features are not properly enabled in the near future, I will be forced
to move my accounts elsewhere, after 30 years as a member.

Internet Explorer does not run under Linux, nor is it a secure browser
on other platforms.  By requiring this browser, you are subjecting your
customers to a high risk of fraud, and exposing First Tech to enormous
legal liability.  Nationally, Internet Explorer has an 85% share. 
However, Oregon is the open source capital of the world and the Oregon
State University Open Source Labs is the main distribution site for
Mozilla and Firefox, which are growing at more than 40% CAGR.  First
Tech in particular caters to high-tech workers, which have a higher
percentage of Macintosh and Linux users.  I would guess your server
statistics show closer to 30% penetration for alternate browsers,
and growing at a fast clip.

Will alternate browsers be supported by the time of the board meeting,
or will it be necessary to inform the board of the delays and risks,
so they can budget for indemnification and plan appropriate staff
downsizing to accomodate this unfortunate reduction in customer
access?

Bummer... for some reason this continues to happen in a variety of
sectors.   Even some Linux companies, i.e. Verari, have IE/ActiveX
requirements to interact with their support sites... makes getting
service a PITA.  I have to say if I had the scenario you're seeing I'd
make the stink and switch financial institutions.  Nothing speaks
louder than losing customers (as long as you let them know), IMO. 
Capitalism in action.

/eli,

   Don't get your hopes up too high on this point. Several years ago, Wells
Fargo purchased First Interstate Bank. They closed all the small agricultural
loan branches throughout the western US and forced farmers who had dealt with
their local bankers for decades to call Minneapolis (or some other central
office) for planting loans. They lost 1/3 of all their accounts. It took them
four years to realize that they had lost customers, and started a campaign to
woo them back. Too late. Farmers and growers like to deal with people they
know, and who know them, on a face-to-face basis.

   As companies grow larger they loose touch with the people who keep them in

Before we get too far down this path, I should point out that First
Tech is a member-operated cooperative, and that the board mostly 
comprises volunteer members elected by the other members.  This has
good and bad features - they are good hearted folk, but they are not
all business professionals.  They will be relying on the professional
managers hired by the organization to provide advice, so my "stink"
should be designed with that in mind.

I've found the best way to reach a volunteer board is with a volunteer
spirit;  it is a new day and I'm a little more level-headed than I was
last night.  If we can get more of the members of the credit union on
board, we can come up with some non-threatening positive solutions.
We should engage the local Perl and Ruby-on-Rails communities for
alternatives to Visual Studio and .NET , for example.

I'm a member, I don't have the time and energy to be a board member, but
I'd be willing to go to the meeting and make a stink.

   Rather than making a comment to Keith I should have asked a question: why
do organizations change what works for everyone to a format that works for
only one class of user? Is there a financial incentive for a business such as
a credit union to change to a Web server that allows only one browser to
access it correctly? What might be behind these decisions?

Subject: [PLUG] how to force a reboot with no working rootfs?
Message-ID: <86fyjr3y9i.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I am working on a problem with embedded hardware, trying to remotely
flash a device.  It involves rudely dd'ing a new filesystem onto a
running linux system.  When dd finishes, the libraries in memory end
up incompatible with the newly flashed filesystem binaries (mounted
read-only).  All I need is a way to reboot so that the system can
reset itself and regain sanity.  I have tried copying the old
/sbin/shutdown to a ramdisk and running that after dd'ing, and that
almost works.  the /tmp/shutdown runs, but something else fails
invisibly because it doesn't shutdown.  I only have network access to
the device.  The solution needs to be easier than driving over (after
arranging access to the power cord) and power cycling.  I am currently
bench testing the procedure on an accessible device.

Any ideas?

No idea about the specifics of this case, but the motivator is common
across the board:  Money.

The reason this is the result varies, but is usually some combination
of outsourcing the work to other companies, and reducing staff, in
order to reduce costs.  That part gets handled like so many other
cost-cutting moves, goes to a non-highest bidder (not always the
lowest, but usually...).  Companies that are able to reduce their OWN
costs and get the bid can get there  a number of ways, one of which is
their own IT corners.  Many seem to standardize on non-guru coders and
going with "development packages" that pushed by big vendors... that
lock in not only the programmers, but _their_ customers.

Because Quicken made changes that took effect in the end of April.  If I had
to guess, I would think that First Tech is using Intuit's bill paying service as
their back-end of bill paying service for their customers.  This would save them
time and trouble as they only have to make their connection with Intuit work
not the full bill paying system they had in the past.

If you have /proc mounted, you can enable a reboot-on-hang bit...
don't remember offhand which entry in sys... there are ways to also
manipulate an immediate reboot with some simple C code without all the
libs necessary for shutdown (check busybox sources).  Alternately, I
recall reading in the docs about embedding magic sysreq functions
(which should allow you to force sync/unmount and reboot).

My last resort usually works if things are really bad:  cat /dev/zero
> /proc/kcore

I'd go with the sysrq route, read sysrq.txt from the kernel
Documentation directory.  You should be able to enable the sysrq stuff
in /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq (assuming it was turned on in your kernel
build) and trigger lots of interesting things, including the reboot,
by writing the values from the file to /proc/sysrq-trigger.

Well, let's not underestimate the roles bone headed stupidity,
confounding ignorance, and utterly peter principle defying incompetence
play in these little dramas.  Some days I think that trio accounts for
more casualties on the fields of tranquility and common sense than do
all other actors.

But I may be a bit grumpy today.

Actually, as companies grow larger they just loose touch with people.
The human aspect of business is albeit lost in most large companies it
seems.  That's why I try to only deal with the little folks.  ;-)  Btw,
I took a gander at your business, Rich, and I like the concept.  Keep up
the good work.  :-)

As far as the 1st Tech web interface, I use OpenSuSE and I don't seem to
have any issues.  However, this is not to say that there isn't some
problems.  I'm finding that it seems the concept of testing the web
interface against multiple browser types as part of web design is not
being properly adhered too anymore.  There seems to be an epidemic of
such lack of attention to detail in this regards all over lately.  I
find that many sites are broken on one browser yet they work with
others.  It's really too bad, in my opinion.

Add me to a list of willing to go to a meeting.

I don't want to run physical wire for telephone when I already have
an ip network.  No dry pair, sorry.  There is no free wire pair 
on the 802.11b segment of my interbuilding link, so I can only get a 
phone signal part way using the 4th pair in the wired segment.

Why does all the information about do it yourself DSL that I can find 
assume telco involvement?  Is an SDSL DSLAM the only inexpensive do it 
yourself DSL option?  The modems I might be able to use are not SDSL
modems.

I would be doing DSL on my own private circuit on private property.  
With DSL on the free pair, I can run more than phone through it with 
the right equipment.  If do it yourself POTS to DSL or do it yourself 
POTS to ethernet is available, getting phone and network connections 
everywhere they are wanted in a collection of buildings becomes much 
easier.

DSL seems hard to do in a private setting, but then POTS to IP network
is more attractive.  For one thing, IP packets can be encrypted.  Another
plus, if POTS signal is converted to IP packets, there is no difficulty
sending these packets over IP based wireless links.  Another possibility 
for POTS to IP is being able to relocate where a call is going to via the
Internet.

I don't want to bury wires next to a well and power poles.  I also don't
want to run exposed phone lines.  Even my buried ethernet segment is 
partially exposed because I had a concrete sidewalk in my way.

Michael C. Robinson

Has the company gone belly up?  I get the impression that their products
allow you to convert PSTN calls to VOIP calls and vice versa.  Is there
a comparable product that also works with Linux?

I'm interested because kernel support seems to be standard for these
products in Linux 2.4 and above.

just to toss in a few brain cells .. sorry if not relevent

carefull on what is called POTS, I've used a POTS->IP->POTS
converter before. I did three things (or three I can remember)
1) simulated the on/off hook signals, with the oldie options
like ground start, loop. 2) Did a analogue 8kbs A/DA. i.e.
voice restricted to either of the two telco standards, and 3)
ring detection and generation, 90V/20CPS.

The key being the 8kbs bandwidth.

For 200' I've used and seen used both RF/Microwave, and Laser,
with both either digital and analogue (long long ago).

Damnit Carla!  I've got ENOUGH books waiting to be read.  Did you HAVE
to include a link to yours?  My copy is on it's way from Amazon now.
Is there a 12 step program for bibliophiles?  

I really my prefer my "This is how it works" books but since starting
my new career as a linux system administator I confess I occaisionally
need a "Make it GO NOW!!!" manual.

Anybody know a good source for cheap book cases?

Typically, they don't know any better.  They just went out and bought or
contracted for a "solution".  Decisionmakers rarely have the tech savvy
to ask about cross-platform compatibility.

For the software developers, cross-platform is just an expense, and it
slows down development by exposing bugs and poor design.  Heck, their
customers are not the bank patrons, but the banks themselves.

A few common ones: end-of-life for their current product; internal
politics; a perceived cost-savings; a really good salesman; someone 
got their underwear in a bunch over some must-have feature; a manager
wanted to display their ability to "shake things up".

  Never... and I do mean *never* underestimate the stupidity of an
ol'school IT manager.  I recently worked for one that tried to hire a
.Net job shop to create a Web GUI for a Linux server app.  That's
right!  A .Net server dedicated to configuring and controlling a Linux
server.  It also would have required IE on the client side to support
the ActiveX controls.

  The sales guy for the programming shop was one slick mo-fo.  He had
all the managers thinking this was a great idea.  I barely managed to
kill the project...

  I suspect the 1st Tech managers had no idea they were purchasing an
IE specific app.  The purchasing manager may not understand anything
about the underlying technology.  It's all magic to the uninformed.

Interesting, but unfortunately /proc/sysrq-trigger isn't present on
the existing image's kernel.  I'd have to build a custom kernel for
the device and install it in limited space.  Probably easier to
arrange access to the power supply.

I beg to differ. Real geeks know that Ikea sells bookcases for about the cost 
of lumber, so they spend a whole day driving to Renton WA and spend a hundred 
bucks on gas and sit in gridlock for hours and get CO2 poisoning and get all 
beat up by the ferocious Ikea shoppers and bang up their cars loading their 
nice new Ikea furniture and still feel like they came out ahead.

This is the same principle that justifies repeated 30-minute drives to Fry's 
to return a defective $5 widget until you get one that works.

Regardless of how storing the books is managed, people who buy lots and lots 
of books are the very finest humans on earth. (lots of books.)

Staples often has good deals on bookshelves. They look nice, too, not tatty.

Anything else would not be "buzzword complient".

Every so often there is a fad in web design that everyone MUST have.  Why? 
Because the ads command you!  Without it your web site is not "cool".

It does not matter how stupid or useless it is, if it is a Buzzword 
complient technology, it has to get installed.

.Nyet and AJAX are two of the current buzzword complient technologies 
being pushed.  (And Microsoft is making it seem like you need .Nyet to get 
AJAX, even though their AJAX component breaks pretty much every web 
standard it touches.)

You have to remember that whatis useful or works has no part in corporate 
web design.  It has to do with what the CIO/CEO/CFO/CYA/EIEIO can brag 
about when he meets with all the other clueless TLAs.

"But what does it DO?" - statement never heard in web design review

It seems that most here are unaware that First Tech CU(formerly the
Tektronix CU) now encompasses Microsoft employees.  Therefore I much
prefer an explanation that involves a conspiracy(aka, the Grassy Knoll
CU).

Yeah, the kcore bit doesn't always work... though I think I remember
using urandom has slightly better results.. probably all a toss of the
dice anyway.

I don't know if it's appropriate, but if you're going to need to do
this regularly you may want to look into installing a STONITH/power
interrupt device in front... rebuilding a kernel with sysrq would
however be cheaper :)

What do you mean funny?

"Next time somebody asks you how Al Queda agents pay for their rifles and 
rocket launchers, you can tell them that foreign hackers make software called 
Linux which helps them steal from Americans."

You dare to mock national security issues? I question your patriotism. Note to 
self: make report to 1-800-FINKOFF

No doubt.  Apparently this guy is so ignorant he is unaware of the NSA's
SELinux project and the widespread use of linux throughout the US
government.  Of course, I could've sworn that computers in general were
outlawed or not allowed to be used by Al Queda or whatnot.  Or maybe
that was Saddam Huisein?  Eh, whatever.  It's all heresay anyway.  I
mean unless the guy is part of intelligence operations he doesn't know
for a fact anything and even if he was, I doubt he would be posting any
information regarding it.  Oi Vey!  Maybe we should condone this guy
because it's morons like this who give linux a good name.  LOL.

#this works ...
arg=$@           # get the argument
first=${arg:0:1} # get one character, starting at the first
echo "first:$first"

#make it all on one line ... does not work
first=${@:0:1}   # bad subsitution

Well if you look at the rest of the site it's for the most part blantantly
one of the best subversive sites I have come across in some time, I found it
humorous enough I'm contemplating buying a T Shirt. Simply brilliant!

Case in point.

"And guess what software Osama Bin Laden uses on his laptop?

If you guessed it was Linux you would be 100% right. Osama uses Linux
because he knows designed to counterfit DVDs, curcumventing the Digital
Millenium Copyright Act, and defraud companies like Disney.

Next time somebody asks you how Al Queda agents pay for their rifles and
rocket launchers, you can tell them that foreign hackers make software
called Linux which helps them steal from Americans."

Indeed.  Quite good.  Fooled me until I found this:

amazed there for a bit that somebody could be so insane.  ;-)

I think it's not allowed to put a reference to an array variable in there like that (the @). Probably the easiest way out is:

foo () {
    shift $(( $# - 1 ))
    echo ${1:0:1}
}

$ foo 11 22 33 44
4

I'm curious though, are the comments real?  Some of the comments are
pretty out there too.

you should read the main page too, there's a rebuttal of criticism on the knowledge of the writer on this topic. Shelley writes:

--
Shelley has given me the opportunity to defend myself; to tell you a little bit about myself and the methodologies I have used to evaluate Windows and Linux. This is also my opportunity to shoot down some of the more fanciful theories that have been proposed in response to my previous warning.

For starters my credentials; I am a former IT manager from a major city in Oklahoma. I am also vice-president of IT for our regional Prayer Team. Some years ago I'm proud to say that I graduated as a Microsoft Certified Engineer; I have a wide understanding of both technical and business computing issues. I am sure you will agree that I am exceptionally qualified to speak on this subject.

I'm sure not many people will get this joke but I couldn't stop laughing at the picture of an MSCE diploma =)

Totally off-topic, but illustrative of the above nonetheless:  A friend 
who used to live in NYC was in town on business on 9/11, staying at the 
Vista in the World Trade Center.  He left his room 45 minutes before the 
first plane hit.  He stayed that night with another friend, and the next 
day we set out in the late morning to find him some clothes, since the 
only thing he had was the suit he'd been wearing.  (He's a big guy, so 
none of my clothes or those of my friend would fit him.)  As you can 
imagine, New York on 9/12 was a city in shock -- but it was still a 
city.  People live there, people need things, like food.  The local 
businesses, the Mom & Pop hardware store, the neighborhood pharmacy, the 
local markets and clothing stores, even a couple of the community 
bookstores, were open.  The chains and big-box stores were not.  I kept 
thinking, somewhat perversely, of the movie "Miracle on 34th Street," 
and imagining that the Macy's depicted in that movie would have been 
open for business, but the Macy's of today, the one owned by retailing 
giant Federated (which is about to turn Meier & Frank's into a Macy's) 
was not.

It's worth thinking about the next time you're faced with the choice of 
ordering something online or driving 40 miles to a big box store to get 
something that you can buy from a local retailer.  Maybe it would cost a 
little more in the short run, but maybe it would be worth it in the long 
run.

Back when I had Windows, this was the only thing I ever used:

                             MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT

                        The Portland Linux/Unix Group
                                  will meet
                          7 PM Thursday May 4, 2006
                                      at

                                 PRESENTATION

                                VectorSection
                     (previously known as: UberConverter)
       Open Source File Format Translation for CAD and Vector Graphics

                                      by

                                 Eric Wilhelm
                         <scratchcomputing at gmail.com>
 
      VectorSection uses concepts such as "small pieces, loosely joined" 
      to inform the design of a set of transparent and simple-yet-capable
      interconnected tools for manipulating and translating 2D and 3D 
      vector graphics data between multiple common and uncommon file 
      formats.

      Learning how this system is put together has applications not 
      just to vector graphics, but to data translation/migration in 
      general.

      This presentation will cover the basics of CAD/vector graphics
      interoperability issues and details about how VectorSection allows 
      for ad-hoc extension in any programming or scripting language.
      
      Note:  I have been told that CNN is in town doing a story on 
      Open Source Software in Portland.  Maybe they will come to our
      meeting.  Better yet, they should go to the Lucky Lab after the
      meeting.

I just logged in and encountered the following problems.

1. username is partially obscured by surrounding box

2. password manager offers to remember the login, but only has a single
   button labeled "OK".

3. link to history before May is missing.  This morning it was there,
   but brought up a blank window.  I guess that's one way to solve the
   problem.


I know other members that are seeing accounts that don't belong to them
listed in with their own.  You might want to keep a close watch on your
account until the dust settles.

Keith,

I was alarmed at your report, as I have no access except Linux running Firefox 
(1.0.8).  But I logged on tonight and had no difficulty.  I transferred funds 
between two accounts just to check it out.  What types of transactions did you 
have difficulty with?

Maybe you need a statically-linked version of
shutdown/halt/reboot/whatever?  Or you could write your own little
thing to call the syscall directly.  Or build a static-linked version
of busybox with just the shutdown/halt/reboot/whatever turned on.

Or if you're able to build out-of-tree kernel modules for that kernel,
I seem to recall the RedHat remote crash dump server source comes with
a test kernel module that just causes the system to panic as soon as
it is loaded.  Combined with the automatic reboot on panic option that
should work.  Not recommended for production environments.

Random ideas.  I spend too much time in front of computers.

The error I was referring to was clipped out of my message by a 
previous poster, hence the confusing message.  I was unable
to access account history to find out if a check cleared.  They
"fixed" the problem of no access for non-IE browsers by turning
off the feature for IE as well, some time in the last 24 hours. 
"Interesting" approach.

Keith, perhaps they're actually doing the right thing. Removing a broken
element of the interface until they can fix it.   If you were them what would
you be doing?

Keith: I did not see what your problem was regarding prior
history. [Did I miss a message?]  I cannot see history before May 1
[except for my VISA account] from *any* browser, Firefox, Opera or IE.

Could I ask for a more complete problem statement?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0605040931330.3989@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I was out for a bit this morning and now I cannot load Web pages in
firefox, nor can I ping those servers ("unknown host ..." is the response I
get). However, e-mail works (at least, incoming does), and when I access the
router's admin Web page I can ping domain names, lookup IP addresses, and
trace routes.

   Tried rebooting the router and stopping/starting /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 but
still cannot load Web pages.

   To summarize: I can ping the router and get mail in and out, I can access
web servers (pinging and tracing the route to them) from the router, but not
from a host on the network.

   Ideas appreciated.

Puzzled,

Rich

   Hey! It worked again!! Just after posting this message, I was able to load
Web pages once again. Never would have happened if I had not asked publicly
for help.

I've been using that on my office XP system to access an ext3 drive in a USB

a few times when I remove the cable or power down the drive.

P.S.  I'm stuck using Outlook here, Paul.  Your MUA forms emails such that
your message is buried in a text file within an attachment within the email.
Probably an Outlook bug, but just FYI.

0) Don't start what I can't finish
1) See what others have successfully implemented (measure user satisfaction)
2) Learning about interaction design before designing an interface
3) Learning about the composition and expectations of my clientele
4) Generating a set of rank prioritized goals
5) Test dummy mockups of the interface on users
6) Develop a structure for modular addition of features
7) Develop a system for multiplatform, high bandwidth testing
8) Code modules and test the hell out of them
9) Assemble an alpha release and test within a firewall
10) Roll out a beta to a cross section of customers, leaving the old intact
10) Roll out the release, leaving the old operating in parallel
11) After users have had a chance to use both, iterate the design to gain
    user share.
12) When the new design has settled, publish a schedule to remove the old
13) Remove the old design
14) Start a new development process

Any or all of the above steps may be performed by outside companies or
be parts of a closed proprietary process.  However, all must be verifiable
by the organization with fiduciary responsibility, which requires some
degree of openess.

Design without awareness of goals is unprofessional.

Replacing a working system with poorly-tested new code is unprofessional.

Parallel operation of old and new is part of the verification process.
If customers don't use the new interface, it is broken and should be
fixed or abandoned.  Arrogant imposition of a new interface without
customer buy-in is evil.

Look at books about user interaction design by Alan Cooper and others.
Doing this right requires skills that the average coder is not expected
to have, and for a coder to attempt this without the skills is as
unprofessional as a cardiologist attempting brain surgery.

Totally based on my own needs:

I've always thought it would be cool to have a mailing
list one can post to. No one ever replies. The whole
purpose is to cause the yet to be discovered mental
process that solves ones issue or need, just on the
basis of making it known to others.

I'd always assumed the "help desk" mailing address of any publicly

You might see if one of the universal adaptors would work.  Office Depot 
carries one for about $80.

I'm using it on my dual-boot lappie.  The power-system modelling SW I use
for my relaying class uses a parallel-port dongle, so I can't run it in
Wine.  Lucky I had a still-in-the-shrinkwrap copy of NT 4.0 I'd
dumpster-dived a few years ago.  (BTW, did you know that IE 2.0 can't
view either www.microsoft.com or www.mozilla.org?)

No, it's actually what satire looks like.  Look at "Meaning and Purpose"

It is getting harder and harder to seperate satire from abject 
cluelessness.  And not just in politics.

alan,

good satire will always bring out the 'cluelessness' from some of
those who read it and respond.  Nothing better than a little
righteousness indignation to bring out the homer in us DOH!    <rotfl>

Should any political party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things.  Among them are a few Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man from other areas. Their number is negligible and they are stupid.  --President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1954 (source:  Eisenhower Presidential Papers, Document #1147; November 8, 1954 The Papers of Dwight David Eisenhower, Volume XV - The Presidency: The Middle Way Part VI: Crises Abroad, Party Problems at Home; September 1954 to December 1954,) Chapter 13: "A new phase of political experience"

to me (the source of this) is not how it may spoof
one of us, is that even when exposed there is a
third of the US that believe the contents regardless
of it being exposed as a fraud.

I've got three or four other sites like it, but
even in spoof are not germane to PLUG, i.e. no

Subject: [PLUG] perl question, Math::Matrix stuff
Message-ID: <86d5es1hot.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


Last night at the Lucky Lab, Eric Wilhelm helpfully suggested
Math::Matrix for a little linear algebra problem I have.  Works great,
but I have one remaining problem.  I want to concatenate the "solution
vector" to another array so that I can print/manipulate it.  I seem to
be doing something ignorant and the solution vector is getting added
to the array as an object.  E.g.:

  $a = new Math::Matrix ([ 1, 0, 0 ]
                         [ 0, 1, 0 ]
                         [ 0, 0, 1 ]);
  $x = new Math::Matrix ([ 1, 2, 3 ]);
  $E = $a->concat($x->transpose);
  $s = $E->solve;

  @output = ($subject,$s->transpose);
  print OUTPUT join(",", at output);

is resulting (annoyingly), as something like:

  001, 1.0  2.0  3.0

but:

  a) I want commas, dammit!

and

  b) I actually want to reformat the values a bit too.

The manual for Math::Matrix doesn't say how to convert from the
supernifty Matrix object to a plain jane array that I want.

I never had this problem in Awk.

I need a giant box labelled "*2000 LBS OF CLUE*" dropped on my head.

Here's what I found after a bit of digging:
- Math Matrix is bad perl mojo, as it doesn't let you get at the innards well 
if you want to.
- It stores each row and column in an array, internally, which you can access.  
Example code:

use Math::Matrix;
my $a = new Math::Matrix( [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9] );

foreach my $col ( 0..2 ) { 
	foreach my $row ( 0..2 ) { 
		print ${$a->[$col]}[$row];
	}
}

Output: 
123456789

You can probably get away with not using hardcoded numbers in the above 
for(each) loops by using the $#array bit (last index of the array). 

Overall, I rate this: "dirty hack"

I am seeing similar issues:

RANT = ON
1) they conveniently allow for the "Naming" of accounts.  This is a good 
thing, especially if, like my family, you have three checking accounts 
and several savings accounts.  Now, along comes bill payer insisting on 
an ACCOUNT NUMBER.  Huh?  Of course all the account numbers changed so 
you have to look that up first.
2) again with bill payer - what is error 171?
3) still more with bill payer - how come it cant seem to figure out that 
82 and 82.00 are the same?  The old system could.
4) they need better music on hold since I have spent several hours there 
(no joy).
5) still even more with bill payer - I tried to pay a bill this AM.  It 
was "accepted" but there is no record that it was paid.  It is not in 
any of the transaction logs.  SO, I tried paying it AGAIN.  This time I 
get: 
The payment for the following payee(s) could not be processed!
Please check the amount and Withdrawal date.
AT&T

a) the amount is correct
b) i tried several withdrawal dates
6) when sending a complaint from the "contact us" page, I get: We are 
sorry. Your post was not received at this time. Please try again later.

 *WTFO???*

I am curious if ANY testing was done with this software.  Based on 
empirical data, the answer is NOPE.

Set RANT=OFF


Sorry, I just had to vent.

May I see the standard, policy or procedure on software testing ?

they are ...

What standard, policy, or procedure do you use to comfirm the software

meets the terms of the contract ?

ah ... 

What standard, policy, or procedure do you use to determine if the contract

Changing the @output assignment line to:

  @output = ($subject,@{$s->transpose->[0]);

does what I want.  While perhaps not a 2000 lb block, the provided
clue was altogether sufficient.  Thanks!

Subject: [PLUG] VMware Guest OS Hangup
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0605051413270.32397@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   When I upgraded my VMware to 5.0 (and now 5.5), I lost the ability to share
files between the host linux network and the guest win98se2. I've been on the
phone with the VMware support tech for more than an hour and the guest 0S can
ping any of the linux hosts, and vice versa. But, the guest OS cannot mount
the shared drive.

   I believe this is because I moved the linux mount point from an nfs-mounted
filesystem (/mnt/usr2/winstuff) to a local filesystem (/data2/winstuff), and
win98 can no longer find it because it has the former path wired in.
/etc/samba/smb.conf includes:

; share name -- modified by RBS 2004-09-22
[winstuff]
    comment = Shared directory for group vmwin98
    path = /data2/winstuff
    writable = yes
    valid users  = @vmwin98
    locking = yes
    create mode = 0660
    directory mode = 0770

   However, when I try to 'map network drive' from within the virtual win98's
drive e:\, the default path '\\salmo\winstuff' returns 'not found.' I think
there must be a way to define the new path properly, but I don't know what
that is. When I've tried to specify the path as '\\salmo\data2\winstuff' I'm
told that's not valid because it could not be found.

   I'd like someone to tell me where in win98 I can change the binding of
\\salmo\winstuff to the new mount point. Or, how to define that within the
map network drive dialog box. Please. I've been fighting this for a long time
and I need to share data between the last two win apps and my linux system.

TIA,

Rich

   Update:

   I just checked, and I made a softlink when I moved the mount point. So 
/mnt/usr2/winstuff points to /data2/winstuff. That can't be the problem.

   Who knows win98 well enough to tell me why it cannot find the drive to
mount, but from a DOS window I can ping salmo and other hosts?

I don't know if this will be of any help, but here is my simple 
smb.conf: (the machine's name is NEC)
-------------------------------------------------------
[global]
    workgroup = House
    security = share

; provide access to /tmp directory
[tmp]
    comment = temporary file space
    path =  /tmp
    read only = no
    public = yes

; provide access to /home/public directory
[public]
    comment =  public directory under /home
    path -  /home/public
    read only = no
    public = yes
-------------------------------------------------------

When I run Map Network Drive I see \\NEC\public in the dropdown list. I 
also see \\NEC, but I get an error message if I try to map it:

    The computer or sharename could not be found. Make sure you typed it
    correctly, and try again.

I don't see \\NEC\tmp. I don't use Map Network Drive, but have never had 
any trouble getting what I want from NEC through Windows Explorer on my 
Win98 machines, or using Konqueror from this SuSE 9.1 machine.

Can you see the directory using Windows Explorer? I can see NEC with two 
top level folders under it, public and tmp, in the folders list. I don't 
know why I don't see tmp in the Map Network Drive list.

Dick,

   The equivalent happens here: I see \\SALMO\WINSHARE in the dropdown list.
That used to work (actually, I'd connect during the boot process), but no
longer. That's the same error message I get.

> Can you see the directory using Windows Explorer?

   No, because it ain't mapped as a drive. When I used to mount, I'd see all
the directories there, plus the files (of course).

I don't "map" the network drive (unless Win98 is doing it for me), but I 
still see the directories specified in smb.conf.

I'm afraid that's the extent of my understanding on this one.

   Normally, we don't need to do this. We connect during boot and it's all
there. The only time a manual mapping is required is when the boot-time
connect fails.

   Well, we're even then.

Thanks,

That's for something different. When I check that box, I get a "Welcome 
to Mozilla Thunderbird!" web page in the pane that displays the contents 
of a selected message. It has links to various pages at mozillaZine or 
the main mozilla page, that it brings up in Firefox.

I understand that, and for awhile I had T-bird set up to handle more 
than one account. But it always used to start up with a list of folders 
in the left pane, and a list of messages in the top-right pane. Now, it 
starts up with the list of folders in the left pane, and a single pane 
on the right with what you get if you click on the account name at the 
top of the list of folders.

I'm trying to have Inbox selected automatically on startup.

Not really.  It's actually pretty well written OO.  Whether overloading 
in Perl is a dirty hack, well -- in an "everything is a string" 
language, it sometimes gets confusing.

The first time you run into it, it might seem weird.  If it's not done 
well, the DWIM might bite you.  But overall it's pretty 
straightforward.

Now, explain why the pure, clean, and consistent OO language has this 
speed-bump in the syntax?

#!/usr/bin/ruby

puts a=lambda {|x|
  f=x+1
  s=f**2
  s/f
}.call(2)

a=lambda do |x|
  f=x+1
  s=f**2
  s/f
end.call(2)
puts a

puts a=lambda do |x|
  f=x+1
  s=f**2
  s/f
end.call(2)

Sorry to leave you hanging all day.  Looks like you figured it out.  
Dereference to get a list.

  @output = ($subject,@{$s->transpose->[0]});

Your earlier output contained ($scalar, $object) where $object would 
typically print as something like the following:

  $ perl -e 'print bless({}, "foo");'
  foo=HASH(0x814cc20)

Or actually, this is an array ref under the hood.

  $ perl -e 'print bless([], Math::Matrix);'
  Math::Matrix=ARRAY(0x814cc20)

But, operator overloading on "" is on, thus the ugly dump builtin 
stringification gets turned into $object->as_string().

>I never had this problem in Awk.

Does awk do operator overloading?

Don't worry.  I still don't quite get it either :-)

  $ perl -e 'print scalar(%{{a => b}})'
  1/8

Subject: [PLUG] Transfer from thumb drive to Windows computer
Message-ID: <20060505215715.ca5e2ee7.johnxj@comcast.net>

So today I was at PSU and needed to print out a document that I had
created in OO.o Writer. I had my 512 MB thumb drive with me. So first I
exported from Writer as PDF, then used Konqueror to copy the PDF file
to the thumb drive. To do so all I needed to do was stick the thumb
drive in a USB port -- it's blue light came on and Konqueror saw it
immediately. Evidently it just auto-mounts. Before copying the PDF file
to the thumb drive I decided I no longer needed any of the files that
were on it, so I deleted them all. The drive was empty when I copied
the PDF file to it.

Having done that I schlepped to the computer lab at the library. I
logged into one of the university's Windows computers, stuck the thumb
drive in one of its USB ports, and tried to print the PDF file. Big
problem -- no PDF file. The Windows computer saw the thumb drive, but
instead of a PDF file it saw a file called reglog.txt. I opened the
reglog.txt file in Notepad and it appeared to be tags, like field names
for a database. Except mostly the tags were empty, although a few had
data in them. And the data was definitely from my computer -- one
"field" had my first name, another had my hotpop e-mail address.
Definitely the file came from my Ubuntu-64 Breezy computer.

Note: The thumb drive is relatively new. It has never been mounted on
my Windows desktop. It has only been used on the Linux laptop, and then
only once before today.

At that point I took my laptop out, booted it up, put the thumb drive
back in a USB port, and all that appears to be on it is the PDF file.
No file named reglog.txt. The PDF file opens for viewing in Konqueror
and is exactly the document that I created.

I finally got past the problem by using my Linux laptop (sitting on a
chair next to me at the lab) to e-mail the file to my pdx.edu e-mail
account, then logging into the account on the university's computer to
retrieve the file. 

Before this happens to me again, I need to figure out what is going on.
I hope someone here can uninscrute the inscrutable madness that caused
this bizarro situation. Any ideas?

Message-ID: <20060505220455.7465949f.johnxj@comcast.net>

Today while trying to boot my Ubuntu-64 Breezy laptop at PSU (see other
post a few minutes ago), Ubuntu decided it do a file system check.
"Booted 30 times, mandatory check" or something like that was the
message.

This has happened numerous times in the past. But today (naturally) it
happened when I was in a hurry and anxious to get going (a lab
assistant was standing by waiting for my computer to boot so I could
show him what was really on my thumb drive). It takes almost five
minutes for it to go through the file system check.

I don't mind that it wants to check the filesystem, it's just that it
always decides to do it at the most inconvenient times. I need a "Not
Now!" command. I tried Ctrl-c but that just allows me to restart the
computer. When it restarts it still wants to check the filesystem.
Anyone know how to get past the automatic filesystem check? Better yet,
is there a way to change it so it stops and asks me before it
automatically does the check?

Stating what FS the thumbdrive is formated with might be wise :)

Do you know if you have the same problem on windows machines other than 
the ones at PSU? If you don't, then you might consider asking a system 
admin or a librarian at PSU for some help on figuring out why their 
machines aren't seeing your pdf file.

Good suggestion. I just tried it on my Windows 2000 desktop and got the same results as at PSU -- that is, it did not see the PDF file and it did see the reglog.txt file. But all this proves is that there is nothing "wrong" with the computers at PSU (except that they're running Windows XP, of course).

Still left with the twin questions, which may or may not be related:

1) Where did the reglog.txt file come from? It must have been created by something on my Linux laptop because the "tags" contain data that could have come only from this computer. Nothing dangerous, just things like my username on my hotpop e-mail account and such that could not possibly have been generated by the Windows computer at the PSU computer lab. What application or utility on my Linux computer created it and put it on the thumb drive? Why? What possible purpose could it have? And why is it invisible to Linux (Konqueror does not show it, and I have Show Hidden Files checked, nor does it show up with slocate.)

2) Why does Windows not see the PDF file on the thumb drive?

As to Brian's question regarding the filesystem on the thumb drive, it must be Fat32. I don't know the Linux command to check it, but I know when it arrived it was new in the packaging, and I never reformatted it. Furthermore, both Windows and Linux seem to be able to read and write to it.

Having said that, things on the Linux laptop bring up a couple questions. Having verified that my Windows desktop treats it the same as the computer at PSU, I unmounted it there and plugged it into the laptop, on which I am writing this with Sylpheed. Sylpheed can navigate to /media/thumbdrive, see the file, and attach it to this e-mail. Konqueror can see it too, and can even display it using Kpdf, which functions as a plugin for Konqueror. However, Adobe Reader 7.0 from chroot cannot see anything in /media except "floppy" and "cdrom," neither of which actually exist (no floppy at all, and the optical drive is cdrom0). But Adobe Reader has lots of other problems on Linux, so perhaps that doesn't prove anything. I also have PDF Viewer installed, and it can open and display the file fine.

More interesting is what happens when I try to find it from the command line. It does not show up at all. (The file is Runes.pdf.) I tried "sudo slocate Runes.pdf" from the root and it found

/home/jjj/.kde/share/apps/kpdf/22627.Runes.pdf.xml
/home/jjj/History_English/Runes.pdf
/chroot/breezy/32bits/home/jjj/.kde/share/apps/kpdf/22627.Runes.pdf.xml
/chroot/breezy/32bits/home/jjj/History_English/Runes.pdf

I am assuming the first is something Konqueror created when I used it to view the document with the Kpdf plugin. The second entry is the original file. And the last two must be links. (I've never understood why everything shows up in chroot as well as in the real world, but that is a lesson for another day.) In sum, slocate doesn't see the file on the thumb drive. But I may be using the syntax wrong.

Anyone have any more ideas?

Not a command line guru by a very long shot, but I think the following
shows there is just the root of the drive:

jjj at Devil5:~$ cd /media/thumbdrive
jjj at Devil5:/media/thumbdrive$ ls -al
total 32
drwxrwxrwx  2 jjj jjj  4096 2006-05-05 15:21 .
drwxr-xr-x  8 jjj jjj  4096 2006-03-17 11:35 ..
-rw-rw-rw-  1 jjj jjj 22627 2006-05-05 15:17 Runes.pdf

Did I interpret that correctly?

On the Windows machine it shows no directories either. 

It occurred to me about half an hour ago that maybe instead of copying
the file to the thumbdrive, Linux just made a link to the file which
remains on the laptop's hard drive as the only location where it really
exists. To test this I used Konqueror to drag another copy to the thumb
drive. When I did so Konqueror gave me the options Move here, Copy
here, Make link here, and Cancel. If I told it to Copy it to the thumb
drive, Konqueror immediately bitched that there was already an
identical file on the thumb drive.

But y'all know that GUI stuff lies a lot. All real truth is revealed
from the command line, right? Is there a command line way to tell what
the file on the thumb drive really is? A genuine copy of the file or a
link?

This is so bizarro. There must be an explanation.

ls -l would show you if it were a link. Instead of the normal file name,
it would be something like foo.pdf -> /home/blah/foo.pdf.

Look through dmesg when you insert the usb drive to see what the device
node for the drive is, it should be something like /dev/sda. To check for
partitions run fdisk -l /dev/sda and it'll tell you what's on it.

Hey Guys...

Ok, this is slightly off topic... but I figured it was linux related.

Anybody here using linux and participating in a Field Day?
Which distro are you using?
Which tools are you using?

1) man fsck ;^)
2) it's distro dependent, some allow you to touch /fastboot and get it over 
with quickly, check your mount init.d script
3) you can change the check interval with e2fstune and turn it off that way 
too (just make sure you actually *do* fsck it once in a while ;^)

------------------------------------------------------------------

So it appears it is just exactly as I thought -- it is FAT32, formatted
as one partition, and there is one file on that partition, Runes.pdf,
no directories or anything else. And especially, no file named
reglog.txt. And Runes.pdf is the file, not a link to the file.

But I have just discovered something else. The file reglog.txt is on my
Windows 2000 desktop. There is a copy in c:\documents and settings\john
\recent documents ... (I didn't scroll all the way out to see how deep
Microsoft buried it), and there is another identical copy in g:\. What
is interesting is that the G drive is a USB 2.0 drive hanging
permanently on the Windows 2000 desktop that I use for backups.

So how did this file get onto the thumb drive? And why can Linux not
see it? And I know it has to be on the thumb drive because that is what
the computer at PSU saw on the thumb drive, and I even opened it there
with Notepad, and the contents were identical to what I just pasted
below from the reglog.txt files on my Windows 2000 desktop:

definitely haven't worked with enough file conversion programs yet.)

I honestly had to scroll back up and check the date.  I guess it's even

Just now it occurred to me to try additional files. So I placed a couple more random files on the thumb drive from the Ubuntu laptop and moved it to my Windows desktop. Windows still couldn't see anything but reglog.txt. And while it was on the Windows desktop I copied several random files to it from the Windows desktop, then moved it back to the Ubuntu laptop. Ubuntu still can't see reglog.txt, nor can it see any of the the files I put on it when it was on the Windows desktop.

Now I have a clearer picture of the problem - both computers can see files they placed on the thumb drive, but neither can see files placed there by the other OS. I still don't understand why this is happening. It's just FAT32. I don't think FAT32 can handle permissions, so that shouldn't be an issue. "Show hidden files" is enabled in Windows Explorer and in all the file managers I have on Linux.

All of the files on the thumb drive are just copies, therefore expendable. I'm thinking about just reformatting it. It's /dev/sda and the partition is sda1. I googled for the command and I think it would be sudo mkfs, but when I looked at man mkfs it listed tons of options, of which I understood only one -- unless you specify a filesystem it will format it ext2. Clearly I need it to be FAT32, but the man page didn't give the syntax for that parameter. Anyone know a more complete tutorial on formatting commands?

What does 'ls -l /dev/sda*' show?

Example:

   Disk /dev/sda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 30401 cylinders
   Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes

      Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System

If you format it with windows, format it as "FAT" instead of FAT 32, see
if it works then. I had issues when I formatted my thumb drive as FAT32
instead of the FAT it was when I first got it.

Subject: [PLUG] Man pages rock! (OK, sometimes, maybe)
Message-ID: <20060507113935.82f58f0c.johnxj@comcast.net>

OMFG a man page actually had an answer I needed and solved a problem.
This is a FIRST!

This morning I finally figured out what was wrong with my thumb drive.
It was never mounted on the Linux computer. Hence, when I copied files
to it, I was really just copying them to the mount point, which is
really just a folder. That also explains why Linux couldn't see
reglog.txt that the Windows desktop put on it. Pretty dumb, eh? OK, I
never claimed to be smart.

So, after considerable trial and error I finally got it mounted, and I
copied a couple files to it as a test. Then I wanted to move it to the
Windows desktop to see if Windows could actually see the files. But I
couldn't get it unmounted. All I got was "the device is busy."
It's /dev/sdb1 and the commands I used were sudo umount /media
thumbdrive (the mount point) and sudo umount /dev/sdb1. Same error
message either way. I also tried using Krusader, a GUI file manager
that has a mount/unmount utility. It saw it as mounted, but when I
click to unmount it (running Krusader as root) it gave me the same "the
device is busy" error message.

Google wasn't helping so, in desperation I tried man umount. And there
was the answer. I needed a "lazy" unmount. So "sudo unmount
-l /dev/sdb1" did the trick. Then I did "mount" to verify that it was
no longer listed as mounted, unplugged it, and took it to the Windows
computer. Lo and behold, Windows happily saw the files I put on it from
the Linux computer! Yay!

I've added this precious information to my CheatSheet file.

Now, for my next learning experience I'm going to see if I can figure
out how to tell if /media/thumbdrive is the thumbdrive or just the
mount point. Like, dragging files there with Konqueror or anything else
doesn't display any difference. They appear there whether they were
copied just to the folder or to the device, and there is no difference
in the way they appear in the GUI. That was the whole problem --
something should have told me "look dumbass, you're just copying the
files to the mount point, not to the device because you're so stupid
you never mounted the device."

You cannot umount a file system if you are using/in that file system.

It is like sawing off a  limb and you are sitting on the limb you are
sawing off...

The most common reason (for me) that I get the device busy errors is
because I have a shell window open where the current working directory
is inside the mounted device filesystem.  That is enough for the
system to consider the device in use, hence the messages.  The other
way to have it in use is for a program to be open with one of the
files in the mounted filesystem open, or even to have started the
program from a command shell inside the mounted filesystem (i.e. "cd
/mnt/blah; acroread blah.pdf; cd /; umount /mnt/blah" won't work).

It's strange, but you'll get used to it.  Windows is much happier to
rip the filesystem out from underneath a running program, which causes
interesting things to happen sometimes.

Seems like something similar came up recently related to moving or 
removing a directory while it is in use.  This of course doesn't bother 
a lot of running programs, but can also lead to interesting behavior.

If you have a /proc/, (e.g. most modern *nix), this script might be of 
use:

A trick I used to use was to create in the mount point, i.e., with the
thumb drive NOT mounted, a file named "UNMOUNTED".  if I saw that
file, I knew I hadn't mounted the device.

Nowadays, I seem to have acquired the habit of just being sure it is
mounted via 'df' or whatever.

andy,

   Interestingly enough, just typing 'mount' -- with no options -- reports
what is mounted.

Thank you for your patience

Our systems are operational, but we are experiencing some difficulties. 
At this time we also have record high call volume and branch activity. 
To get a quicker answe, please review the list of known issues here

Now, note I am not excusing any problems, or anything like that. But 
they are aware of problems, and they appear to be working on it.

Instead of lynching them, give them some time to work out the issues. As 
we all know, test beds are great, but you can never test all cases like 
the end user will.

I know I haven't had any difficulty with firefox and their web site. I 
know that it took several days for all my accounts to become available 
for download. I figure they were running into issues during the transfer 
and they had priorities. Making sure our account balances are correct is 
hopefully priority number 1.

I do know of a case where my checking account is visible by one other 
member that I did not expect. I have a joint loan with her. I haven't 
called yet because there's a plausible explanation, and they are 
experiencing difficulties. I'll give them a call in a week or so to make 
sure my suspicions are correct.

As for the history link, it's on my interface, and it brings up what 
appears to be a list of the accounts from the old software. I did a few 
lookups, and everything appears as I expect it.

Don't know what to tell you, because that's exactly what happens when I 
start up Tbird:  list of folders on the left, with "Inbox" for my 
default account pre-selected; list of messages in the Inbox on the 
right.  I don't use the preview pane (that is, I keep it closed), so for 
me it's just left & right, not left & top right/bottom right.  I have 
only two accounts -- my default is one that connects to my (remote) IMAP 
mail server; the other is just "Local Folders."  Tbird is configured to 
connect to the server at startup and sync.

Maybe double-check and make sure you have designated a default account 
-- i.e, the one whose Inbox you want displayed?  Otherwise, there are 
some startup settings in about:config you might try fiddling with, but 
your guess is as good as mine as to what setting might have the desired 
effect.

Ok,, it's Sunday and getting late, so maybe my reading comprehension 
skills are taking a break, but can someone explain this?:

"Legal fears also seem on the rise with regard to open source software, 
according to panel moderator and attorney Hank Jones. He has seen major 
acquisitions delayed or cancelled after pursuers put the software assets 
of their target under the microscope. The "increased scrutiny that is 
now occurring" has started to turn up some horror stories, Jones said. 
In particular, companies have discovered that assets claimed as 
proprietary often end up having plenty of code pinched from various open 
source projects."

How is that a problem for open source development?  If the acquisition 
targets are committing fraud (by claiming assets they don't have -- in 
this case, claiming proprietary software assets that are, in fact, 
violating other's copyrights), then that's a problem with these 
companies' proprietary software development methods and models, not with 
open source development.  Wouldn't it seem that this kind of thing 
should be an argument in favor of open source development, in part 
because open source development removes the temptation to claim assets 
one doesn't own?

Fraud is fraud, whatever development model you're talking about.  If a 
company is misrepresenting its assets and open source development makes 
it easier to catch them before investors pump money into the company, I 
would think that's a good thing.

Thanks. I do have ext3. The hard drive is hda, and the partitions are
hda1 (swap) and hda2. So I assume I want

tune2fs -i 0 -c 0 /dev/hda2

But where do I put it? The system hasn't booted yet, so I guess I can't
go to a command line. This must be entered in some startup script,
right? Im too new to Linux to know which one. I read the man page for
tune2fs, but it assumed I knew where to use the command.

You just need to run it once; it updates the filesystem metadata the
e2fsck uses to determine whether to fsck or not.

I don't think John wanted to permanently turn off disk checks.  He just
wanted to be able to skip them when they were inconvenient.

On my Redhat systems I can pass a 'fastboot' argument on the boot command
line to skip the disk checks.  You could create a separate entry in grub
that passes this argument, giving you the option to boot with disk checks
skipped.  Another option which should work on most systems is to boot
into single user mode, touch /fastboot, then exit.  This would boot the
system with disk checks skipped.

Not to be mistaken for a troll.. I'm mostly used to a few other *nix OS's.

But is there any file system in Linux that supports background fsck?
This whole "holding up the boot process" thing seems very cumbersome :)

This is exactly what I want. In fact, the other day was the first time
it happened when I really, really needed to skip it. Normally I can
just go make a cup of coffee or something. Being just a common user I
must trust the Ubuntu people who set it up to check every 30th boot --
they must have a good reason for setting it up that way.

A very good question. I'm assuming the answer is no, because otherwise
everyone would be recommending it. But I'd love to hear otherwise. It
would be especially useful on a laptop. 

In fact, I'm toying with the idea of upgrading the 4200 rpm 60 GB hard
disk in this laptop to something faster. It really slows things down a
lot. Program launch times are especially slow, an big annoyance on a
laptop. So if there is a better filesystem to use than ext3, now is the
time to learn about it.

With ext3, you don't actually /need/ periodic fscks--it's just as well
to disable them altogether and (maybe) sometimes force a fsck.  I don't
recall the last time I actually did a fsck in Linux, except when I was
experimenting with things and causing crashes.

I have been watching this thread and wondering why I hadn't seen this 
forced fsck happen.  It finally occured to me...I rarely shut my Ubuntu 
box off.  It hasn't seen 30 boots since I installed Ubuntu on it.  
Judging by what I am reading here, maybe I should manually cause the 
system to run fsck once in a while???

I've been watching this too and am puzzled.  What's the point at all? 
If the system is being shutdown properly then fsck shouldn't be needed 
on boot outside of special scenarios.  BSD doesn't do this.

To quote:  

http://batleth.sapienti-sat.org/projects/FAQs/ext3-faq.html

Q: If a system shutdown hard, even with journaling is it at all necessary to 
run e2fsck?

Theodore Ts'o said:
It's best to just always run e2fsck. [...]
E2fsck will run the journal automatically, and if the filesystem is otherwise 
clean, it skip doing a full filesystem check.
If the filesystem is not clean (because during the previous run the kernel 
noticed some filesystem inconsistencies), e2fsck will automatically do a full 
check if it is necessary.
If you have multiple disks, fsck will run multiple e2fsck processes in 
parallel, thus speeding up your boot sequence than if you let the kernel 
replay the journal for each filesystem when it tries to mount it, since then 
the journal replays will be done sequentially, instead of in parallel.



Or, in fewer words, "Yeah."

by default ext3 gets checked every N time *or* every N days, whichever comes first. Sooner or later you'll hit the 180days mark which is the default for the N days value ;^)

You mean BSD doesn't force an fsck if you're using ext3?  Or BSD 
doesn't, in general?  I thought that the lack of fsck's in FreeBSD with 
UFS is owing to softupdates, which (as I understand it) head off the 
problems fsck's are supposed to fix.  Don't softupdates write the 
metadata out always and keep the file system in an incorruptible (i.e., 
by a power outage) state?

Maybe I'm behind the times on the status of file system support in 
FreeBSD, but I thought that it supported reading and writing to an ext3 
partition only in non-journaled mode.  I want to find out more about 
this anyway, because I'm still interested in trying FreeBSD.

There are two times that it will try to force an fsck.

1) When the partition is marked "unclean".  This is when the partition was 
not properly unmounted before a reboot.

2) When the partition has reached a maximal count. This is a parameter 
that is set by tune2fs.  If you are running a machine that has frequent 
reboots, this will happen more frequently than you would want.

It is the second situation that is causing the forced checks.

Very interesting discussion, which I am finding very educational! A few questions:

1) I haven't experienced any problem in the past year running my hard drive with ext3. So what would y'all recommend for a laptop that is rebooted an average of 1.5 times a day and for which a backup of /home+ is made every time a significant amount of new stuff is added (like a day or two of work)? Like, how often should fsck be run? I'm not interested in *absolute* safety; I'm interested in what is reasonable. E.g., in the final analysis, we're all dead anyway. So what is a reasonable tradeoff between safety and usability?

2) I just ordered a new 80 GB 7200 rpm hard disk for my laptop. Should I put ext3 on it, or might something else be better? 

3) What utilities exist for transferring the old stuff to the new? Like, is there a utility that will copy the existing hard drive to the new one so that I can just pop the new one in and be able to boot the computer as if nothing happened? [The existing hard drive is 60 GB and I have a 60 GB external USB pocket drive that I can use for this process.] What utilities are there to make a disk image? Or should I just plan on starting over from scratch? (ugh)

Suggestions welcome :)

I mean in general, FreeBSD and OpenBSD in my own use doesn't force an 
fsck on a reboot unless the volume wasn't marked clean such as in the 
case of a power outage.  To put it another way, and to the best of my 
knowledge, the BSD's do not force an fsck on reboots just for safety's 
sake when all is well.

As for keeping a file system in an incorruptible state, well, eventually 
something bad enough can happen.  My old web server hard drive sits next 
to me as a reminder. :(

You're more up on file systems than I am, and I run native file systems 
to the respective OS's I use, so I can't speak of Linux extX under BSD.

Not long ago, Aaron posted a link to an article at Debian Administration 
that compared some file systems:

http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/388

He also posted a link to a discussion of the article at LWN:
http://lwn.net/Articles/181343/

I think you'd probably find both are helpful and informative.

Is this a problem with the way Ubuntu encourages creating mount points 
under /media instead of under /mnt? I read, I think on the Ubuntu 
mailing list or forum, that you should create mount points under /media 
so that Ubuntu will display them on the desktop when mounted. That would 
be with the default Gnome environment anyway; I'm not sure whether it 
would be different with Kubuntu or Xubuntu. But if you had created your 
mount point under /mnt (say, /mnt/thumbdrive instead of 
/media/thumbdrive), would Konqueror have let you copy files there if the 
drive wasn't actually mounted?

I don't have a USB stick nor do I use Konqueror -- I'm just curious 
whether you'd have had the same issue if you used /mnt. I know I found 
Ubuntu's way of doing things a little confusing because I am used to 
thinking of /mnt as the place for mounting removable media and storage. 
I thought that Linux file system hierarchy standard had decreed it so.

/media is the location for removable media, such as cdrom, usb
thumbdrives, etc. as of FHS-2.3.  Rationale from the spec
(http://www.pathname.com/fhs/):

"Historically there have been a number of other different places used
to mount removeable media such as /cdrom, /mnt or /mnt/cdrom. Placing
the mount points for all removeable media directly in the root
directory would potentially result in a large number of extra
directories in /. Although the use of subdirectories in /mnt as a
mount point has recently been common, it conflicts with a much older
tradition of using /mnt directly as a temporary mount point."

Message-ID: <44604914.7000506@verizon.net>

Hey gang,

I recently downloaded and installed Firestarter on my Ubuntu box and 
disabled the firewall in the Actiontec modem/router/wireless...

I read a newsletter talking about security risks and so I installed nmap 
and gave it a try.

Here is some of the output of nmap on my system:

23/tcp open  telnet
80/tcp open  http

                         Difficulty=4367995 (Good luck!)

               Raw packets sent: 512 (20.7KB) | Rcvd: 512 (24KB)


Is this bad?

If you're running the nmap scans from your machine, then you will
likely bypass most (all) typical firewall rules.  A standard allow
rule in most "kit" setups is to allow all connections to the loopback
(localhost / 127.0.0.1) and to the public ethernet if the origin is
the same interface.  You didn't specify, so that's my assumption.

What I'd be most worried about is tha telnet is running at all...
first order of busines is to decide why it is, and move to using SSH
for remote access.   Second, track down an externally-originated scan
of your host to get a view of what your firewall rules are blocking;
the nmap website has at least one link to such a site/service IIRC.

Congrats on taking the interest and effort into looking at system security!

BSD expected you to periodically check your filesystems, but did not
traditionally implement a mechanism to remind, let alone force, you to
do so.  In fact, SMM:1, "Installing and Operating 4.4BSD" recommends
checking file systems EVERY WEEK or so.  (pg 51, sect 6.3 "Filesystem
checks, backups, and disaster recovery")  Now, obviously no one checks
filesystems every week and filesystem stability has improved
considerably in the 13 years since that was written.  But periodic
maintenance has always been expected.

As I said, I just turn the periodic checks off with ext3.  If you're
paranoid, turn off the mount-count and just keep the 180 day checks.

ext3 will give you the least headaches.  If you were experienced admin
and had an application that required something the other filesystems
might provide, it might warrant it.  Otherwise, stick with the
mainstream.

Or in a few more words, "yeah, if the system was 'shutdown hard' (i.e.,
did not umount cleanly)."  Otherwise, "nope."

How much older, I wonder?  I've never seen that, and given the popularity of
mounts within /mnt, it would no longer seem practical to use /mnt directly
at all.  So the /media idea seems misguided to me.

>From everything I have read I think you are right about ext3. That's what I will use, then. 

Regarding the forced filesystem checks, the consensus seems to be that they are not really necessary with ext3 unless the system is shut down dirty. Unfortunately, that happens to me a lot. About once a week I lock up the gnome shell and am left with no mouse or keyboard. As far as I know Linux is still running just fine underneath, but since I can't get to it I have no choice but to hit the power button. 

In the many years that I have used Windows NT-2000 on my desktop I have experienced that only three or four times. But when it happens Windows *always* forces a filesystem check on rebooting. However, it never forces a filesystem check otherwise. It seems to me that this might be the proper strategy for me on my Ubuntu laptop -- turn it off, but make it happen if Linux was shut down dirty. Now I need to figure out how to use tune2fs to make that happen. Later today I'll have time to read the man page and google and stuff.

And I also need to figure out another issue -- how to move my existing system to the new hard disk when it arrives. I'm sure there must be utilities. The existing hard disk is 60 GB and I have an external 60 GB USB pocket drive that I have been using for backups. So I have appropriate hardware. I just need to figure out what utilities I need and how to use them.

You are correct.  I did run it from my machine.  I read from 
Firestarter's web page that the normal install allowed connections that 
originated here.   It didn't click.

As far as telnet goes, I haven't a clue why it is running.  If it isn't 
from the standard Ubuntu install (5.10) or if my son didn't start it to 
access the Tacoma library while he was here, I know of no reason for it 
to be running. 

So...the next question would be how do I turn it off, and why is it on 
in the first place?
Second question would be what are the chances of someone exploiting that 
open port on a Linux box with nothing of real interest on it, and why 
would they?

Cool, by the point:

1) It may be a default-on daemon in Ubuntu, I'm too not familiar with
the distro.
2) Check the ubuntu/debian wiki, there's a lot of
distribution-specific help in there.
3) It's entirely feasible that someone would attempt to exploit that,
success or not is highly variable.
4) Therein lies the question of human nature, why would anyone do
something that's harmful to someone they don't know...

Can you use <Ctrl><F1> (I think that's the keystroke) to get a CLI login? 
If you can / do, you could log in and kill X and force it to restart. 
Obviously, you would lose any work you hadn't saved yet (you do frequent
saves I hope) but you would still not be shutting down "hard".  Of course,
if you have a second terminal you can always ssh in and do a clean restart
too....

Did you run the scan against your machine or your router?

I'm guessing against your router, since I don't know of an Ubuntu
distro with a 2.4 kernel.

Well, you probably want to try again against your actual machine :-) 
I curious why telnet is running on your router.

Ignoring net/open BSD..
We aren't talking about Linux 2.0, so let's not talk about BSD 4.4 either :)

In FreeBSD 5 and above, if the file system is marked dirty (because of a
power failure or the like) the system does not stop booting. Background
fsck is run instead.

Hm, my mistake for responding to the wrong message.  This was what I
_should_ have responded to:

My point is, with plain FFS/UFS or ext2 periodic checks were considered
part of normal maintenance; ext2 was just a bit more aggressive about
making it happen.

Or possibly ctrl+alt+back space while in X?  That's the three finger 
solute for X and will kill it.

This is often fixable with "Cntrl-Alt-Backspace".  Linux is not
like Windows;  the GUI runs on top of X-windows in user space,
separately from the underlying operating system.  That means that
the X-Windows layer can be stopped and started without rebooting
and without corrupting disks.  Yes, there are some poorly written
Gnome applications that can lock up Gnome (since all are in user
space, all can potentially step on each other), but something must
be hosed indeed for user space activity to take out a running kernel.

You should write down, as best as you can remember, what you were
doing and what applications were running when the crash occured. 
I know you use an external mouse, for example.  A poorly designed
external mouse might "vibrate" between neighboring pixels and
generate a hell of a lot of interrupts, which at some busy times might
overwhelm Linux.  A new mouse might fix that.  It is good to keep a
text window open on one of your virtual desktops, and occasionally
type "free" and "uptime"; you may notice that the memory use or load
average is climbing an hour or two before your crash.

If CT-AL-BS doesn't bring you back (rapidly) to a new login window,
and if you cannot ping the machine from elsewhere when hooked up to
the ethernet,  then your kernel is indeed stopping.  This requires
rebooting, and you should look for the cause.

If the kernel is locking up, my best guess is that the display driver
for your laptop is flawed.  Probably closed-source for your video
chipset, right?  It just goes to show how open-source is more practical
than closed.  Keep an eye out for updated display drivers;  sometimes
even proprietary vendors manage to get a clue and fix things.

If the display driver is not the culprit, another thing to check on
a laptop is built-in features that are enabled but that you are not
using.  For example, you might have a serial port or a modem that
are enabled in the BIOS, but Linux doesn't know about them or how
to handle their interrupts.  A mouse movement might get interpreted
as a modem call, perhaps.  Go into the BIOS during powerup and turn
off the features you don't need.

The point is, a reasonably well tuned Linux system does not need
rebooting.  My laptop gets suspended when I am not using it, but
it stays booted for weeks or months.  Every once in a great while,
I need to reboot it (like this weekend, when it decided it wouldn't
mount a compact flash card), but I have never seen a gnome-caused
lockup that a CT-AL-BS wouldn't fix.  Yes, rebooting can sometimes
be faster than finding the root cause of a problem, but in the long
run it is better to clean up all the problems.  Linux and open source
give you the power to do so.

Going back to the original thread about fsck, perhaps I should be
purposely forcing a full fsck from time to time.  As it is, it only
happens at 7 or 8 month intervals, that is 180 days plus the weeks
until the next reboot.  I would feel more secure if fsck ran more
often than that.  Sometimes high uptime is too much of a good thing!

If you do that in initlevel 5 I believe it tries to restart X.

One of the first things I do on a new install is change the default 
runlevel to 3.  Saves me a lot of headaches when I have to rebuild my X 
drivers.  (NVIDIA drivers do not like to be rebuilt while X is running. 
Something about unloading modules in use...)

It's not unusual for an embedded system such as a cheap router or
access point to have a telnet server running.  It's low-impact, and
Windows users don't have to install new software to log in (a telnet
client is already there, available through the DOS shell). The telnet
daemon usually only listens on LAN-side interfaces (i.e., a scan
from the Internet won't show anything listening on port 23).

Everone seems to have missed a tidbit in what I said earlier. When it
locks up, the keyboard and mouse are BOTH dead. So Ctrl-this and
Alt-that ain't gonna happen. The only button that still works is the
power button.

It would be nice to figure out what is causing it, but from my
experience it is pretty random, with one possible exception: Kdar will
lock things up about one backup out of three. Normally I don't back up
my mp3s because I keep them in a separate folder outside of /home, plus
I have them all copied to my Windows computer as well, but once when I
did Kdar locked up, and again on the second attempt. There are about 14
GB of them. This leads me to believe it might be a USB problem, since
the backups are going to the pocket drive on USB. Otherwise, the
lockups seem to be random, although, as Keith points out, I do have an
external USB mouse. So if there is something flaky going on with USB,
that could account for the rest of the lockups.

I have always enjoyed the fact that my external USB mouse "just works."
I can boot the computer completely without plugging it in, and when I
do, it instantly works. I can unplug it, plug it back in, and it works.
It's just perfectly hot-swappable. The touchpad has an on-off button
which I normally leave off because I hate it. But if I turn it on the
touchpad immediately starts to work too, whether it was on when I
booted the computer or not. I can have both working at the same time if
I want to, although normally I use just the external mouse. The
touchpad is just for situations where I get to the university and
discover that I left the external mouse sitting at home on the desk.
Because both work so perfectly it's hard to believe that either is the
cause of the lockups.

As for video drivers, originally I used the open source video drivers.
They ran just fine except that I was never able to get a DVD to play.
Then one day several months ago I learned how to install the
proprietary nVidia drivers. That fixed the DVD problem. However, it
locked up before and continues to lock up afterwards, with about the
same frequency, so I doubt the nVidia drivers had anything to do with
it. The nVidia proprietary drivers not only permit playing DVDs, but
the screen refresh is faster, so I want to keep them -- unless, of
course, I eventually discover that they are the source of the problem.

I have a client here in Portland who has an office in Seattle. They just
had a switch half-die, and it took a long time to diagnose over the
phone. It would be nice to have someone local who won't complain that
the whole thing is broken and start trying to sell them an Exchange
server (like the last three consultants they've hired). 

There are some personality issues, and the ideal consultant will be
patient and tactful, checking facts before taking action.

Any ideas? They have a Linux server which is vastly underused, since
most of the work is done over their VPN to a server in the Portland
office. The rest of the office runs Windows and must remain so because
they are heavy AutoCAD users.

Thanks!

Drive up there and replace the switch?  You get paid by this client 
right?  Their downtime is (probably) hurting them a lot more than the 7 
hours of travel time you will charge them for.

If the keyboard and mouse are completely locked up (CTL-ALT-Backspace
doesn't work to kill X, etc.) then it sounds more like a kernel panic.
 Are your keyboard LEDs blinking (caps lock LED for example)?

See, that's when you SSH in and run `/etc/init.d/gdm restart` or similar.

I don't know what SSH means, but I am guessing that you are assuming
the laptop is on a network. At home it usually is. At PSU it is
sometimes on PubNet, if I've logged in (which I don't do unless I need
the internet), but even if I went to a computer lab I doubt I could
figure out how to find my laptop, even assuming I had enough
permissions to do so. Besides, I'd have to take it with me, which means
I'd have to shut it down anyway. And sometimes I'm at Coffee People or
someplace like that. Or just sitting in the park blocks with it in my
lap. 

Anyway, the better solution would be to figure out what is causing it
and fix it. :)

Everything is dead. No blinking lights. Nada. Only the power button light is lit up. No disk activity (light is out). There is a CPU meter on the gnome panel that shows 800 - 1600 - 2000 MHz, depending on how hard the CPU is working. When it locks up it is at 800. I've had programs go into endless loops, in which case the CPU meter sticks at 2000, but in those cases the mouse and keyboard are still functioning, so I can go to a shell and use top to kill the program (assuming I can figure out what top is calling it). When it locks up the computer looks perfectly normal; it just doesn't work any more. :(

I have always just assumed it was gnome that was locking up, not Linux. But what do I know?

Granted this is marginally related to your current problem, and my 
experience is over 20 years old, but back when I worked at Apollo 
Computer in the mid 80's, they were AutoCAD users and ran a UNIX 
version. If that's still available, there may be an opportunity to move 
them off of Windows.

That's going to be R14 at best and good luck getting a legal copy.  How 
would that binary work on ix86 linux?  AutoDesk threw all of their 
chips in the Redmond pile quite a few years ago, though in the last few 
years, their open source activity makes me wonder exactly what's going 
on there.

AutoCAD 2000 runs on fairly well Wine.  But, even that is getting long 
in the tooth.  I'm not sure how well newer versions do.

Well, we Portlanders won't be left out -- we are inviting anyone who is interested in learning, discussing, and sharing around Plone (the best Open Source content management system, http://plone.org) to the first Portland-based Plone Users Group meeting. We hope that this initial meeting will kick start a group that meets monthly to help new developers and consultants get started, to facilitate the transfer of knowledge among veterans, and to encourage networking and collaboration. Most importantly, this first meeting will include snacks!

Well, we Portlanders won't be left out -- we are inviting anyone who is interested in learning, discussing, and sharing around Plone (the best Open Source content management system, http://plone.org) to the first Portland-based Plone Users Group meeting. We hope that this initial meeting will kick start a group that meets monthly to help new developers and consultants get started, to facilitate the transfer of knowledge among veterans, and to encourage networking and collaboration. Most importantly, this first meeting will include snacks!

No, the person who bought the cheap switch (about 14 months ago) is no
longer employed there, and part of the reason is that she ignored my
suggestions and bought cheap stuff.

They have a new switch there already. The problem is that between
playing 'telephone' both literally and figuratively, response clarity
(or lack thereof), and some personality issues I alluded to earlier, it
took about 20 hours between the onset of the problem and the fix. If
they had someone local to call, it would have taken travel time plus
about an hour. I can't always drop everything and take a day out of the
office to travel.

So, no one has a competent friend to refer?

Thanks again.

I want to read them on a Linux system.  The Tandy Color Computer 3 used IBM
disk drives, so I should be able, given the proper file system support,
to read them on a Linux system.  I wouldn't mind being able to read the
old rom paks as well, though I'd need special hardware for that.

I don't know where to buy 5.25" blank 360k floppy disks.  If anyone
can give me a tip on how to get a modern 3.5" disk drive to work, 
I'd appreciate that.  I guess noone makes 5.25" floppies anymore.

I'd love to be able to use a standard ATA-100 hard drive with my
color computer as well.

   We seem to have a run of these hardware issues. My situation was a bad CPU
(but I have a perfectly good motherboard that was unnecessarily replaced). If
you can borrow a replacement CPU, give that a try. That was how I diagnosed
my problem. As soon as I put in the replacement I was able to successfully
build a 2.6 kernel; the replaced CPU would become comatose part way into the
task.

I can't say off the top of my head what problems would occur (though 
DHCP and Windows network browsing sound like probable candidates), 
but I have the same hunch as you.

Routers were invented for just this situation. :-)

The only "problem" you'll run into is that any machines as 10.1.1.0/24 (the windows boxen) will NOT be able to talk to machines that are 10.1.anythingbut1.X because their netmask tells them that address is not local and they must use a gateway to reach it. Having a router routeback on the same interface is considered very bad practice and there's absolutely no reason to do it.

As suggested by another listee, routers were invented precisely for this situation. Either give all the machines on the segment the same netmasks, or make two segments.

If the idea is to make two "networks" and prevent the machines from talking, you must have separate physical networks because anyone can change the IP address or spoof ARP packets or any other malicious methods of seeing data you don't want them to. At the very least, use two completely separate ranges (10.1.1.0/24 and 10.1.2.0/24 or the like) instead of overlapping two ranges with different sizes.

Somebody I know is proposing to mix netmasks on the same physical
network.  That is to say all machines that are supposed to talk to each
other (servers and clients of those servers) would be in 10.1.1.0/24.
Engineering machines (prototypes, machines under test) would be in
10.1.0.0/16 in the 10.1.2 range and engineering workstations, which
needed to talk to the servers and the test macnines would be in the
10.1.1.0 range with a netmask of 255.255.0.0

I told him that that was a bad idea, and I think it would cause

It certainly is a bad idea. First thing to consider is that each subnet once designated will have a gateway and a broadcast address at the bottom and top of the range. These will overlap with the larger subnet that you have created. For anything machines outside the larger subnet commuicating with machines in the smaller subnets there will have to be an appropriate router. If there is not a router for each subnet then the broadcast traffic will not be seen by most of the machines and conversely most of the machines will not be able to access the default gateway on the larger subnet. The reason I say most is that the lowest subnet broken out of the larger subnet will be able to access the gateway x.x.x.1(but not the broadcast address) and the last subnet broken out of the larger subnet will be able to access the broadcast address x.x.x.255(but not the gateway).
You may want to encourage him to try it. Its a great excersise. We just had one of our admins assign his new servers to a /24 when the network it was on was a 23. That was interesting. if you established an outbound(offnet) session with the server then you could access it from other nets just fine. But once the arp record staled in the router it would fall off line. The problem was that he was on the fist leg of the larger subnet so he could access the gateway and move traffic but when you tried to access his server from off net the broadcast was going to the x.x.x.255 on a different net.
Fun...
Hope my ramblings help!

This sounds like a form of multi-netting which, in and of itself is OK.

I'm a little confused by your description.  Is this restatement of it correct?

  Hosts           NetRange
Srvrs Clients   10.1.1.0/24
Engineering     10.1.0.0/16 network addresses assigned in 10.1.2.0/24,
prototypes and test boxes
Eng Wkstations  10.1.1.0/16 (nonsensical network/netmask definition)

Do the engineering boxes in 10.1.0.0/16 need to talk with the servers in
10.1.1.0/24?  The issue you'll have, with the current definition, is the
10.1.1.0/24 machines will need a gateway router to return traffic to to 10.1.0.0
or 10.1.2.0 address ranges.

Of course this assumes that the netmasks you've described will be applied to the
hosts.  If the admin is using the netmasks as shorthand to describe the use of the
10.1.0.0/16 address space and not the network configuration on the hosts and in
fact every machine will have a netmask of 255.255.0.0 then it won't be a problem.

I have a scsi 9-track tape drive in my living room.  I bet that there is a 
scsi exabyte drive in the sun 670-mp.  (It has three scsi tape drives in 
it.)

Drop me an e-mail off line and we will make arrangements.

Making the machine fail consistently is a desirable first step.  A good
way to exercise it is to build a kernel.  See if you can find a script
on the net that will repeatedly build a kernel and check the results.
I'm fairly certain that something like this is out there.

If you just want to move forward, the next thing I would try is swapping
power supplies.

Pacific Solutions seels a power supply tester for about $15.

Also might be a video card issue or a heat issue.

Does the bios have a heat sensor?  Look and see how hot the processor is 
running.

The CPU usually runs at 55C; some brag that theirs
runs around 40C. It's at least two years old. (It's a

Autodesk must be getting one heck of a payback
from $Soft.

The big boys it is not a question of cost, but
funtionality. A friend at Catapiller told me
the cost line item is at the bottom of the matrix.

I wish Dassault Systemes (Catia etc.) would port
to Linux, they run on Solaris/AIX/HPUX today. then
offer lower cost versions of their packages. Blows
the socks of Autocad. MSC has made the leap, maybe
before I'm dead Dassult or AutoDesk will.

Word has it that the graphics cards are the hang-up.  Demand for 
graphics cards is driven by availability of software that needs them, 
software waits for graphics support, repeat.  Go figure.  Doesn't seem 
to bother PTC.  Good luck on selling the business case of investing 
more effort in creating cheaper software too.

>Blows the socks of Autocad.

For relational and parametric modeling?  Sure.  It always helps to use 
something that is er, relational and parametric for that sort of thing.  
Now model a mile-long building.  Gets a bit slow at times.

For drafting?  Last I saw their sketcher was horrid and their prints 
were at least limited by over-zealous DWIM.

I think you mean, "it's all about wasting money here in the US."  
The latest debacles in DC clearly indicate that open-source supporters
need to spring for some hookers 'n' coke.  Then the tax dollars and
laws will flow our way in abundance, whether they're needed or not.

It costs the corporations money without enriching the brass, and it
makes managers look bad.  Both are mortal sins inside any corporation.

I certainly wouldn't mean to imply that the societal adoption of
workplace social mores reflects a shift from a democratic republic to a
"corporate state." <cough> <cough> "CEO President" <cough> <cough>

Agreed, but you're assuming that any of these folks actually care about
fairness, legality or intellectual property, beyond the threat of 
embarassment from lawsuits or scuttled deals.

Open source is uncontrolled, doesn't make sense and can embarass the
brass, therefore it is Evil and Wrong.

Sorry for the politics and cynicism,

totally agree on the slow part, and more then agree
on the sketcher, just shows being big does not
mean can do. wonder if is not that the skill is there
but the marketing/corp. isn't. always room for some
one to do better and then get borged like Visio.

didn't really mean to say 3ds has the only solutions,
but unless autodesk looks outside the $Soft box,
i think there is a opportunities out there at least
to run on linux.

Lower cost version. maybe autodesk has the SCM (small
CAD market), but to me that's the same as saying $Soft
has the SBM sown up. I hope not.

what advantage would there be to have a FOSS CAD
package, other then cost ? I would love to be able
to push FOSS CAD to some of my ME - Architect - Civil E
- etc friends but have not found what to say while
on the FOSS Server/Desktop soapbox.

oh well sorry, been listening too much to that other

Actually it was R12 and it ran on Solaris.  Older copies of AutoCAD more 
than one or two releases will cause trouble quickly if you do any sort 
of drawing interchange with other companies.  I wouldn't run anything 
older than 2002 right now and I still get dwg's that require me to use 
2005/6.

AutoCAD is not Catia, and vice versa.  You cannot make such a statement. 
  They do different things and have different purposes.  One thing I 
have noticed though and so far I have not been proved wrong, Catia users 
think they are God.

Could you elaboratle on "physical"? Perhaps he's using VLANS (Virtual
LANS) to segment the traffic. Using VLANS is common for such an activity,
as you get the benefit of broadcast isolation, which won't occur if you
are simply multinetting on the same LAN segment.

umm.  Hackability?  Vendor-independent interoperability?  Inter-office 
change tracking?  Contract/working-drawings/BOM integration that 
actually works?  Custom software for small businesses pushing the 
envelope?  Any other number of things that Scratch Computing aims to 
enable?

Seriously, the de Young cladding would been practically impossible and 
riddled with human error had it not been for the hardcore automation, 
and that wasn't even feasible to do as a commercial cad system plugin 
((a)  startup cost, lock-in risk, and vendor evaluation latency would 
have basically killed it, (b) the project requirements changed about 
daily (more on that at tonight's perl-mongers if you're so inclined), 
and (c) GUI-based/VB/whatever automation can really suck when all you 
need to do is twiddle an input and regen.)

In the current environment, it is still really difficult to get any sort 
of CAD users onto Linux.  QCad isn't going to do it.  I don't believe 
it is going to grow out of community contribution either -- engineers 
might know how to program FORTRAN, Pascal, etc.  But, even if they've 
got mad C, C++, Perl, Ruby, or Python skills, the fact is that they are 
way too worn out at the end of the day to try to assemble a complex 
software architecture into their head and hammer out some code.  So, 
the Linux/Apache codebase growth model is looking bleak, what about the 
Mozilla/OpenOffice/Blender opening-of-proprietary-code model?  Well, I 
guess AutoDesk could decide to drop that bomb whenever they feel like 
it, but my guess is that there is way too much licensed "not my IP" in 
there to make that feasible for them or anyone else.  The government 
funding to BRLCAD is encouraging, but they are heavily focused on 
simulating ballistics and designing tanks, so usability suffers.

Which brings us to private funding.  I'm not seeing a huge list of open 
source CAD software development companies with $2M seed funding and a 
business model to make it work.  I've been particularly focused on 
trying to find a sustainable-growth model involving custom development 
leveraging open-source, but the combined challenges of "lack of 
infrastructure, lack of time, lack of sales, and trying to get 
something in a price-point that works for small businesses" really 
stack up against it.

Okay, getting closer to on-topic...

How many people on this list know of engineers, architects, etc. that 
would like to be running Linux if it weren't for that sticky CAD issue?  
I would be happy to hear from them on or off list.  I'm certainly up 
for putting together something (maybe even at OSCamp) if there is 
enough interest.

maybe individually not the same, but by the time a shop
has all the addons, acad+fem+abc+def etc, maybe i'm wrong.

the god part i think comes from the older users /
owners of catia, they paid $100K->1M to have it so they have
to justify it :).

one smaller user i know personally has it along with a
its sister products since they
are one of the many small boeing suppliers. to them it
was boeing biz == having catia. they know they dont even rate
chosen-one rating, and are happy being regular
folk.

-pete will return to the back of the bus, since moving

the one cad+manufacturing shop i've had experience with,
one part owned by a friend now used linux for everything
but cad. there is even one cad-driver (mech.eng.)that has
two boxes and displays on his desk, one box running $Soft
for cad the other linux for everything else, the 2nd
display connects to both pc's.

they were hacked by some windoz hole a couple years ago.
it never got past the webserver, but that was enough for
them.

hmmm .. how about digital version of a video editor box
that lets you overlay two feeds onto one display ?

I'll give it a try. Don't feel like messing with virtual environments. Once I 
heard that hitting Ctrl+Print Screen saved screenshots to the root folder, 
but it's never worked for me. What good is a Print Screen key anyway, hmph.

while vmware is nice and gives you decent speed, it also costs money

qemu is free, and perhaps slowish (slower than vmware), maybe fast enough for a text installer (for an example installer screenshots in qemu see http://lunar-linux.org/~sofar/1.5.0-screenshots/installer-boot.html ). Toss on the non-free but gratis kqemu and performance is acceptable, especially on faster systems.

bochs is sloooow but would work the same as qemu.

serial console is uber-fast (native cpu speed) but usually requires some tweaking and/or cable mess. You can get the same effect by using qemu with console->serial->terminal redirection, and capture using ^A^H by running it all under 'screen', maybe doesn't work too well with colors though

My preferred method still is qemu since the fonts are acceptable and it's relatively easy to use a grabber to get the window, and all free.

Cheers,

Auke

Not necessarily anymore. See:

Message-ID: <20060510155325.f1826c53.jmpurser@gmail.com>

For my sins I've been assigned the care of one SuSE server.  I'd like
to install logwatch on it but can't find a SuSE package for logwatch.
I have run across some vauge warnings about trying to use the redhat
package and missing instructions on building logwatch on SuSE.

Anyone got  a lead, tip, how-to, or direct experience with this?

cat /etc/SuSE-release
SuSE Linux 9.3 (x86-64)
VERSION = 9.3

Thanks,

John Purser

That may yet happen. UGS's NX runs on Linux now. (It is not free in any 
sense of the word, as far as I know.)

Now, why would they do *that*?

   I have perhaps a dozen letters that I would like to have scanned as .pdf
files. Kinko's wants too much, IMO, for the service. I know of no one with a
scanner, and I don't have sufficient need to spend a lot of money on one.

   Any recommendations on an inexpensive scanner that produces readable text
(as in a scanned letter) and is known to work with xsane?

I can't remember thde website, but if you google for it there is a website devoted exclusively to scanners that work with Linux. I do have an old scanner (ancient, actually) connected to my Windows 2000 desktop, but I wanted a new one and one that was 1) portable and 2) completely compatible with Linux. I ended up getting a Canon LiDE 30 and it works perfectly with Xsane and the other Linux scanning utilities. I couldn't be happier.

OCR, on the other hand, is an much sadder story. Basically, it hasn't made it to Linux yet. So if you want to scan and OCR, good luck. (I did find a free website that would OCR from a TIFF file, and that is what I have been using, even though it does a pretty crappy job.)

If you can wait until the next clinic, I can bring my scanner with and will be happy to scan your documents for you. In fact, there is a PDXLinux meeting tomorrow (Thursday) at the Fireside that I plan to attend. I could bring it and we could do it there. Let me know, as I would not ordinarily bring it unless I know someone needs it (another 2 Kg in my pack).

If you have a SCSI adapter available, any of the older HP ScanJet
units work great. I can vouch for the IIcx. It's like having an
aircraft carrier on your desk, but they're fully supported by Sane,
and can usually be found for ~$20 on eBay or Craigslist.

I'll second the vote for a Canon LiDE 30.  Not professional grade, but
perfectly fine for scanning letters, and even photos.  It also runs
fully off the USB power, so one less poorly-designed transformer to
find room for on the power strip.

I'll third the LiDE 30.  Not for performance, but the compatibility
and cheapness is excellent.  I've found that I need to plug it to get
hotplug to pickup with $kernel_version (2.6.8?) but other than that it
is pretty happy.

Look at scanbuttond and possibly my silly scanq program.  (As stupid
ruby hacks go, it's worth a mention but not a link.)

OCR works, it's just not easy.

I'll also throw in 2**32-1 "no" votes for visioneer.

I won't cross post Plone group information again, but since there
might be some who have not yet joined the OneNW Portland Plone Email
List (http://lists.onenw.org/lists/subscribe/plone_portland), I
thought I would mention to both these lists that I've posted the

Thanks again Jon and Darci for giving presentations; I learned a lot.
And, if you missed the meeting, or don't know Plone, I would recommend
these talks as it really gives a great introduction to Plone.

Chris,

    Personally, I wouldn't mind a certain amount of cross posting - 
especially cross postings of meeting announcements and of podcast 
postings.

    Also, thank you for doing the pod thing.
I'm interested in plone, but probably can't make many of the meetings.

   That's interesting. Several years ago I had a Umax scanner (known to be
supported by sane) and bought another SCSI card for it. Could never get it to
work properly. The card would connect to a SCSI ZIP drive, but not the
scanner. It sat here collecting dust until I gave it away.

Thanks, Paul,

   Been there many times. Also had bad experience with a Umax model that was
supposed to be fully supported, but the specific SCSI adapter I bought for it
never produced a working system.

   I've use jocr many times with highly satisfactory results. In this case,
however, I don't want to translate the imate to text; I want a PDF image of
the scanned letter.

   Thank you for the offer. I'll look at used hardware on Craig's list and let
you know.

Just to clarify... The Fireside gang are called PDXLUG, not PDXLinux.
The domain name for the PLUG is PDXLinux.Org.  PDXLUG is *not* the
Portland Linux User Group or the Portland Linux/Unix Group.

PDXLUG is (descriptively) another Linux user group in Portland, but
PDXLUG just stands for PDXLUG.  When you want to refer to PDXLUG,
please refer to them as PDXLUG.  It will help to minimize the
inevitable confusion.

PLUG *is* either the Portland Linux User Group or, more frequently
these days, the Portland Linux/Unix Group.

Yes, this is tedious.  Yes, they've been asked to change their name to
something less confusing.  No, sadly, their isn't any obvious progress
in that direction.

   Thank you all. I have received an offer of an older HP unit that works in
monochrome, but not at all satisfactorily in color. My need is to produce pdf
scans of textual material, so this is an ideal solution.

Subject: [PLUG] Reading Archaic Media
Message-ID: <20060511174709.GA32425@gate.kl-ic.com>


Is it time for a "reading archaic media" party? 

Dave and Alan can read 9 track tape, I have a couple of tapes.
I can bring some SCSI Exabyte drives, 2GB/5GB, if somebody can
talk to the SCSI.  I can also bring some SCSI drives that read
ancient DC600 tapes, and an older Iomega drive or two.  If pressed,
I could even bring a minitower with an Adaptec SCSI card and
CD burner and monitor and keyboard, but that is more work ... 

Now if somebody can read Tektronix-formatted DC300 tapes, or the
old small-spool DEC tapes, or Commodore cassette, or 8 inch CPM
floppy, or papertape, or punchcard, I can read ALL the old media I
have squirreled away for the last 40 years.  I do have options for
papertape and punchcard though;  I can read those visually ... :-)

Often the problem is not reading the raw media, but interpreting
the bytes on them into modern data files.  Is there a CPAN module
for converting Baudot or EBCDIC into ASCII?  Howsabout cuneiform?

I can imagine Randal organizing a "read old media" cruise.  We
show up with our old media and old equipment, spend the cruise
time reading and converting our old media, and when we are done
we pitch the old media over the side ...  :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Case-insensitivity and GNU make
Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.64.0605111412230.4497@arrowhead.galois.com>

My personal web site contains a few technical articles, the sources 
for which are marked up in DocBook.

The top level directory looks like this:

   CVS/               index.html              sendmail-auth/
   Makefile           index.xml               sendmail-genericstable/
   apache-fp/         ldap-aliases/           soho-bind/
   apache-google/     open-letter-microsoft/  sort-addr/
   dhcp-failover/     openssl/                specs/
   dig/               pine-macosx/            trac-centos/
   exim4-ssl-client/  pine-ssl/               utf8/
   gpg-quickstart/    rcs/

Revision control is provided by CVS -- hence the CVS directory -- but 
I have an article stored in a directory called "rcs"; it contains a 
Makefile and an XML source doc (and current, an HTML target doc):

   CVS/   Makefile   index.html   index.xml

I recently moved my main workstation to an Intel-based Mac mini, so I 
rsync-ed my projects tree from my Linux box to the Mac. I've had 
occasion to build files in the subdirectories of the source tree 
listed above, but until today I hadn't had to run make in the 
top-level directory. Oops:

   [heinlein]$ make
   co  RCS/index.html index.html
   co: RCS/index.html:1: missing 'head' keyword
   co aborted
   make: *** [index.html] Error 1

To make a long story short, GNU make has an implicit rule that looks 
for %,v or RCS/% or RCS/%,v. If it finds one of those, it will try to 
checkout the file before executing the target commands. You can get a 
list of all the implicit rules by asking nicely:

   make -p -f/dev/null 2>&1 | less

The Mac's filesystem is case-insensitive, so it interpreted the 
presence of the "rcs" directory just the same as "RCS" -- so it tried 
to checkout rcs/index.html. Since that's not a real RCS file, it 
failed.

Ugh. Silly Macintosh.

There are a couple solutions:

1. Turn off all explicit rules from the command line:

    make -r

2. In the Makefile redefine the offending rule(s) as no-ops. This
    is the tack I chose:

    # override gnu make's auto-checkout feature. bad mojo here...
    %:: %,v
    %:: RCS/%,v
    %:: RCS/%

    # rest of makefile ...

The hard part would be (a) getting the media readers on board,
and (b) finding enough power to light them all up. :)

The 9-track I have draws about 750 watts.

The exabyte is a not quite the space heater that the 9-track is.

I thought OS X could also do UFS/FFS?  At least, NeXTSTEP 3.3 did... ;)

There's an option for case-sensitivity, but it's not the default and 
Macs don't ship with it. It's relatively easy to create a disk image 
with a sane filesystem and mount it; I just haven't yet done so at 
home.

There are some reports of certain Mac applications (Photoshop being 
one) behaving badly on case-sensitive filesystems -- but I've never 
seen such things first hand.

I don't know if this applied in your case, but there were multiple scsi
scanners that had problems
if there was any other scsi device on the bus; or were very sensitive to
exactly how the bus
was terminated.

Yep. Mention was made here of a Hewlett-Packard IIcx. That is exactly
the scanner I have used on my Windows desktop(s) since I bought it new
during previous millennium. It works, but has always been flaky about
the SCSI bus. Sometimes I have to restart the scanning or copy utility
repeatedly before it sees the scanner. Sometimes it will just stop in
the middle of a scan. Restarting the scan usually works, but sometimes
I have to restart the copy or scan utility.

In contrast, the USB 2.0 connection from my Ubuntu-64 laptop to my
Canon LiDE 30 works first time, every time. A bit on the slow side, but
that is probably a USB issue. However, while the connection to the
Canon is far better under Linux, OCR is far better under Windows.

I just wanted to add my voice to the chorus of complaints about SCSI
connections to HP scanners. HP's SCSI scanner connections suck.

Subject: [amesfug] still trying to load linux

Hi folks,

I'm still stuck on loading Linux on my new computer, a self-built with an
AS939SLI32-eSATA2 M1695 939 motherboard, an Athlon 64 3000+ 1.8G 939P R
processor, two 250Gb Western Digital SATA2 hard drives which I've set up as
a mirror pair.  I've followed the istructions at
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml as carefully as I
know how.  When configuring the kernel, I used genkernel so as to include
drivers for as may devices as possible.

While I'm doing the install, everything appears to work.  Files appear to be
copied to the hard drive, and I can hear the hard drives working.  This
makes me think my hardware is OK.  When I get to the very end and reboot,
grub loads (suggesting to me that the hard drives are working after the
reboot) and a bunch of drivers load (suggesting to me that the boot sector
at /dev/sda1 is working).  Then I get a series of messages:

>>Activating udev
>>Determining root device...
!!Block device /dev/sda3 is not a valid root device...
!!The root block device is unspecified or not detected.
Please specify a device to boot, or "shell" for a shell...
boot() ::

If I type "shell" at the prompt, I see:

boot() :: shell

Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

Typing "help" gets:

    fg hash help jobs kill let local pwd read readonly return set
    shift times trap true type ulimit umask unalies unset wait

I have discovered that /usr/bin, /sbin, and /bin exist and are on the path,
and the commands I have tried from those directories seem to work.

Patterned after code listing 4 on this page
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml?part=1&chap=10,
these commands are in my grub.conf:

root (hd0,0)
kernel /boot/kernel-genkernel-x86_64-2.6.15-gentoo-r7 root=/dev/ram0
init=/linuxrc ramdisk=8192 real_root=/dev/sda3 udev
initrd /boot/initramfs-genkernel-x86_64-2.6.15-gentoo-r7

I really feel like I must be very close to a working system.  Any
suggestions of what I need to do next?

What type of mirror?  Using Linux software raid or the alleged
hardware raid on the motherboard?  If it is the former, then your root
device will probably be something other than /dev/sda3 (like /dev/md0
or however that works these days).  If the latter, then I'm guessing
the motherboard "raid" only works in Windows as it is "fake-raid".
See http://linux-ata.org/ for more info and status of ULi chipset,
which looks to be what your board has.

You have the busybox shell loaded, and a minimal ramdisk filesystem.
I expect if you typed "mount" you would see that your hard drives are
not actually mounted.

What happens if you type "fdisk -l" at the busybox prompt?  Do you see
one hard drive (/dev/sda) or two (/dev/sda and /dev/sdb)?

David,

I cannot help with this but there is a guy his name is Cybodog. He hangs 
out in the freenode channel of #oklinux. He may have some ideas for you. 
If not, he will know someone that can help.

Okay, apparently the ramdisk does not have fdisk.  Try running fdisk
from your install disk or another bootable CD (like Knoppix).  The
goal is to determine whether your RAID is working.  If you see only
one drive, then either the other drive isn't working or the RAID is
working transparently (I would be surprised).  If you see two drives
then it is as I expect, and you have fake-raid.

Assuming you have fake-raid, I would recommend using the software RAID
Linux provides (assuming you still want mirroring).  The performance
is excellent and you are less likely to run into strange problems
later.  That said, I have not used RAID of any kind for a while, so
there may be others on this list who feel like adding their input.

Ultimately the amount of effort to get it right the first time is
worth the long-term reliability.  Out of curiosity, when you created
the filesystem(s) (mkfs), what device(s) did you provide to it?
/dev/sda3?  Other (non-Gentoo) distros will likely have an installer
that would set up the software RAID for you.  The choice of distro is
yours to make of course :-)

Did you empty the Recycle Bin on the Win98 machine? If not, I think you have 
the option to restore the file.

Thanks for the thought, but Win98 doesn't store deleted files in the 
Recycle Bin if those files were on another machine. There is an updated 
version of Samba that adds that capability, but I have not installed it.

Once deleted, they are "gone" in the sense that they are not visible to 
the file system utilities, like Explorer. However, just as in Windows, 
they are sitting there on the drive unchanged, but just unreferenced. I 
don't work at that level often enough to remember what Linux calls the 
little boxes on the hard drive that hold parts of files and, more 
importantly, how to look at them and reclaim them before they are reused 
for some other file. Even back in the days of DOS, there was a Norton 
tool to recover erased files simply by changing the first character in 
the filename from (something that meant unused) back to what it used to 
be. There's a similar concept in Linux (although not quite that simple) 
but I can't remember what it's called so I can go read the man page 
about how to recover the deleted files.

Hi:

I am trying to dual boot a box between Linux and WinXP.
Both OS are on separate disks (so hd0 is Linux and hd1 is WinXP).
Linux side is Ubuntu.   I am using grub and my menu.lst
has the normal linux boot entries plus this for the WinXP:

    tiitle  WinXP
   rootnoverify (hd1,0)
   makeactive
   chainloader +1


When I select WinXP at boot time (default to Linux), I receive an echo of 
the
above lines and a beep sound follow by 2 lines of non-printable characters 
on
my screen.  And then it is stuck...

Did I do something wrong?   Any tip much appreciated!!

If "title" really is required, you might need to spell
it correctly.

You're booting from the second hard drive. I think
GRUB has another command to switch boot order, and you
may need it for Windows to work.

Aha! "Undelete" rings a bell. Sure enough, that second one pointed to a 
HowTo that I remember. I also remember that, while it works, rebuilding 
from a backup and just adding the handful of entries since the backup 
will be easier!

I really should look into upgrading Samba and adding that "recycle bin" 
feature.

Thanks.

   It used to be -- with earlier versions of Microsoft -- that it would boot
only from the first hard drive. Try Tim's suggestion, or rejumper the drives
(and alter mount points) so the XP is hd0 and linux is on hd1.

Subject: [PLUG] fstab hell(p)
Message-ID: <4468AB16.8080500@writemoore.net>

I've become hopelessly muddled on how properly to set-up an ext3 
partition I want to share between Linux OS'es.

I set up one large ext3 partition when I reinstalled Debian.  The fstab 
line is:

/dev/sdb5       /mnt/library    ext3    defaults        0       2

I want this to be automounted when I boot into either Linux OS, which is 
happening.  But only root can write to it, since root is the owner.  How 
do I allow my user accounts in each OS read & write access?  I use the 
same username and UID in each OS, so there shouldn't be any file 
ownership conflicts when I go from one to the other.

Every bit of googling and every printed reference I have (including the 
Linux Cookbook) turns up how to accomplish this (or similar) for 
accessing Windows  or vfat partitions, but I can't find the right 
entries to do it for an ext3 partition and I can't parse man mount or 
man fstab well enough to figure it out.  UID doesn't work, it's not a 
recognized option for ext3.  I know one way to do it is to change the 
ownership of the whole partition, but I thought that was a security 
risk.  Am I wrong about that?

   On Slackware and reiserfs or ext3 (two different hosts here), 'defaults'
includes users and read-write priviledges. If I was at your console, I'd
modify /etc/fstabs so that line reads
         defaults,users,rw

and see if that fixes the issue with explicit instructions. Please report
your findings.

No, that doesn't do it. I tried deleting the partition and recreating it 
from within Debian. Still no joy. I tried removing the automount by 
adding "noauto" to the fstab line, so that when I boot up it's not 
mounted, and I explicitly mount it from my user account. I can mount it, 
but I still can't write to it.

There has to be a way to do this, yes? Or is the only way to change the 
ownership? One reference I have says that you should *not* change the 
ownership of /mnt or any top-level partitions. But how do I write to the 
damn partition then?

What's so irritating about this is that I know exactly what to do if I 
were using vfat, but I don't want to use that. Every Linux help page I 
come across is geared to helping you dual boot with Windows, or set up 
shared partitions with Windows, or otherwise interacting with Windows -- 
how about some help for Linux users who don't have Windows? Even in a 
Linux world, it's still a Windows world.

I tell you, at this stage, I'm tempted to go out and buy Windows. I've 
been at this all morning. It shouldn't be this hard.

The "user" option only allows non-root users to mount and unmount a
file system. It doesn't affect file system permissions.

I think you're getting your terminology a bit confused. You're trying
to mount a file system (that lives on a hard disk partition). The
file system gets mounted to a mount point, which is just another
directory on an already mounted file system.

Have you looked at the permissions set on the file system you're
trying to mount? Not the permissions of the mount point (those get
overridden once the file system is mounted), but the permissions of
the file system itself.

There's probably no need to change the ownership of the root of the
file system itself (that would be the mount point /mnt/whatever
*after* you've mounted the file system). It might be the easiest
route, though. I can't think of any fundamental security concern
beyond allowing everyone else on the system to read your files.

How do I look at the permissions set on the file system? I don't 
understand the distinction between the permissions of a mount point, a 
directory, a file, and a file system.

The mount point is /mnt/library. The fstab entry, currently, is:

/dev/sdb1 /mnt/library ext3 defaults,users,rw,noauto 0 2

It is one primary partition on my second hard drive (sdb). I added the 
"noauto" option just to see if I could write to it when I mounted it 
from my user account. I would prefer, however, that it be mounted at 
boot. "Users" has no effect except letting me mount it; "rw" I think is 
that default anyway, so that's probably redundant. But at this point I'm 
getting desperate.

This is what I get after mounting it:

mcubed at debathlon:~$ ls -al /mnt
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 2006-04-15 14:40 .
drwxr-xr-x 22 root root 4096 2006-05-15 03:12 ..
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 2006-05-15 10:21 library

mcubed at debathlon:~$ cd /mnt/library
mcubed at debathlon:/mnt/library$ ls -al
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 2006-05-15 10:21 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 2006-04-15 14:40 ..
drwx------ 2 root root 16384 2006-05-15 10:21 lost+found

I can write to it as root:

mcubed at debathlon:/mnt/library$ sudo touch testfile
Password:
mcubed at debathlon:/mnt/library$ ls -al
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 2006-05-15 11:48 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 2006-04-15 14:40 ..
drwx------ 2 root root 16384 2006-05-15 10:21 lost+found
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 2006-05-15 11:48 testfile

But when I try to create a file as a user, I get 'permission denied.'

So if I change the ownership of /mnt/library to my own user and group, I 
would be able to write to the directory or partition or filesystem or 
however you want to phrase it? Because I thought I tried that before, 
and it didn't work without also changing the ownership of /mnt itself. 
And that's what I thought you weren't supposed to do.

Michael,

   What do you see for /dev/ddb1 when you type 'mount'? It should show the
mount point, filesystem type and (rw) if you can read and write to it.

Presuming you meant "/dev/sdb1" instead of "/dev/ddb1," this is what 
"mount" shows:

/dev/sdb1 on /mnt/library type ext3 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)

A mount point is just a directory on another file system (any file
system that isn't the one you're trying to mount). Typically, mount
points live on the root file system. The mount point, being just
another directory, has its own permissions settings, but these don't
have any effect on what you can and cannot do to a file system once
it's been mounted there. Once you've actually mounted a file system to
a mount point, the permissions that used to be set on the mount point
(when it was just a lonely directory) magically disappear, and the
permissions of the root level of the mounted file system take their
place. The mounted file system effectively "masks off" the original
directory being used as the mount point.

Unless you want to be able to mount and unmount the "library" file
system as a normal (non-root) user, then you don't neet the "user"
option in your fstab (it's "user", not "users"). And if you want the
file system automatically mounted when the system starts up, then
remove the "noauto" option. Finally, "defaults" implies "rw", so it's
not necessary to include. But it looks like you may know all this
already.

That's because only root has write permissions to the filesystem. If
you don't have a firm grasp on *nix file system permissions, the LDP
has decent overview in their intro guide:
<http://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_04.html>

Yes, that would work, *if* you make those changes after the file
system has been mounted.

Try this, as root, with the file system mounted:
1) cd /mnt/library
2) mkdir mikes_stuff
3) chown mcubed. mikes_stuff

Your normal user account should be able to read and write to the new
"mikes_stuff" directory.

Additionally, you could also just perform step #3 on /mnt/library
(again, *after* you've mounted the file system). It's mostly just a
matter of personal preference. You should not have to adjust the
permissions of /mnt. It does need to be "executable" by any user that
wishes to access the lower levels (such as /mnt/library) but that
should be the default (unless someone's changed it).

"ls -l /" should have an entry for "mnt" similar to the following:
   drwxr-xr-x    4 root root 4.0K Jan 19 03:12 mnt/

I follow all of that up until "the permissions of the root level of the 
mounted file system take their place." I still don't understand how a 
"file system" has permissions. Maybe it's just the terminology that is 
confusing me. I thought directories and files have permissions. I 
thought a "file system" referred to a file system type (ext3, ReiserFS, 
xfs, ntfs, etc.), and as such had no particular permissions.

In any case, I think I understand what you're saying with regard to how 
the permissions actually work. What you're saying is pretty much how I 
understood it all to work, it's just that way you're saying it that's 
new to me.

Well I *do* have a decent understanding of the how permissions work, or 
I thought I did; what I'm shaky on (and nervous about) is the security 
issues with regard to mount points and top-level directories.

That works just fine. But what still doesn't work is creating a 
directory (folder) or file with Nautilus. This is I think this is what 
really screwed me up.

I changed the ownership of /mnt/library to my user account, so that the 
permissions now read:

mcubed at debathlon:/mnt$ ls -al
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 2006-04-15 14:40 .
drwxr-xr-x 22 root root 4096 2006-05-15 03:12 ..
drwxr-xr-x 5 mcubed mcubed 4096 2006-05-15 13:07 library

/mnt itself is still owned by root, as I believe it should be.

This is how I had originally tried to set it up, several hours ago. (I'm 
going to cry!)

And you're right, my normal user account can read and write to the 
/mnt/library directory. From a terminal I can create files and 
directories under /mnt/library with my normal user account. I can also 
create directories under /mnt/library with Midnight Commander.

But when I click on the desktop shortcut for the mount point, Nautilus 
still will not let me create a folder or a file. If I open a 
sub-directory that I've already created (like /mnt/library/testdir) then 
I can create more folders and files with Nautilus. That, no doubt, is 
what has been happening all along. I didn't actually test it in a 
terminal when I had originally set it up this way, I just tried making a 
folder with Nautilus, and that failed, so I thought I had screwed up the 
permissions or ownership. I guess the moral of the story is don't trust 
friggin' GUI file managers when it comes to trying to figure these 
things out.

I want my day back!

Thanks to you and Rich for all your help.

How can I search for a particular thread or subject in all of this year's

   I still cannot copy from firefox and paste into a text editor; this used to
be a non-issue. It is an important issue for me because I need to do this
frequently, and I'd like to learn the source of the problem so it can be
fixed. I posted on this subject some time ago and I'd like to review those

   OK. Here's the update. This is a known bug in all 1.5.x versions of
Firefox, regardless of platform. Firefox would randomly stop copying into the
X11 buffer; sometimes restarting the application provided a temporary fix.
Apparently enough folks starting shrieking about the issue that the cause was
found and fixed -- supposedly in 1.5.0.4. I'm going to see if it's available.

   I'll let you know what I find.

It's not a file system permission.  The "root level of the mounted
filesystem" is just a directory.  The permissions of that directory
control what is allowed.  An equivalent would be the permissions
on /

You can use apt, it worked for me. You can also use Synaptic and search for
mysql.

apt-get install mysql-server-5.0

John (hi!),

Ubuntu isn't an rpm-based system. For a list of all mysql-related 
packages, use aptitude:

   aptitude search mysql

In this case, you'll probably want to install the mysql virtual 
package:

   sudo apt-get install mysql

In Ubuntu it will need to be

sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Ubuntu still has an older version in the repositories.
I don't think  RPMs work with Debian based systems so they should be of 
no value in Ubuntu.

Message-ID: <446B6536.2020103@spek.org>

hello,
  does anybody have any recommendations for a ping monitoring program
that can:
  - be run from a console/terminal window
  - ping multiple hosts
  - have some easy to parse-by-a-human output (it doesn't need to be
    machine parsed)
  - keep a log of when something was unpingable
  - not require a database

thanks,
Brent

I actually used to use the ping screensaver in xscreensaver for that, the
one that looks like a sonar display in a submarine.  You can configure it to
show multiple hosts, with a visual representation of their ping times, but I
don't think it'll log for you.

No, but it can run in a window or even in the root/background of your
desktop, if you're running X.  If you're running Winders, it probably won't
run at all, unless xscreensaver has been ported.

  Take a look at "fping".  You may need to write a wrapper program to
getting the logging options you want.  There is some example perl code
in the man page.

Subject: [PLUG] No updates for Windows anymore...
Message-ID: <1147897563.446b86db7c805@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Sadly, along with XP: 98Se 98, probably ME, etc. are not easily updated anymore.
Why did Microsoft do this?  There are a lot of computers around that won't
run XP let alone anything else that is more recent.  If Microsoft really wants
to tick people off, it should release a new Windows variant that won't run on
most of the computers around.  Sure, break driver and software compatibility
again in mass.  When you realize that Windows programs are easily $29 a piece 
or more on average, losing a library of such programs could prove quite 
painful. 

Are there are any reasonable OSS clones of old versions of Windows?  I like
Freedos, but when I tried to install 98 second edition over it hoping I'd
be able to use either system off of the same partition, I ran into major 
problems.  My Freedos image is the beta 9 release, don't know if it ever
got out of beta.

What I don't care for is that Windows is getting more bloated and Microsoft
is getting more aggressive about pushing people to buy new releases.  It 
used to be with 98 update cd's for example that you only needed one file in
particular to trick the copy protection.  If I ran Microsoft, I'd release the
next version of Windows under the GPL and simply keep minor parts of the OS
proprietary.  At least I'd release the updates under a license that is similar
to the GPL.  The public should not have to pay for Microsoft's programming
mistakes nor should the public lose access to critical updates because 
Microsoft doesn't feel like providing them anymore.

I'm wondering how Linspire and Xandros are doing, but it appears that these
are purchase only systems and that there isn't an evaluation version.  Vmware
is nice, but I get tired of worrying about licenses with actual Microsoft
products even under vmware.  I'm stuck getting evaluation keys for vmware
because I can't afford the license yet.

I bet I'm not alone in wondering why I should buy another computer so that I 
can run Vista.  XP has only been around for 4 years, hasn't it?

Why isn't Novell putting out it's own competitive desktop product to Windows?
Novell's networking code is traditionally better than Microsoft's.  If Novell
would open source NDS, it would really fly as a samba alternative.  Novell
could probably do well supporting their code even after open sourcing it.
Imagine Windows programs redesigned to easily abstract to competitor network
protocols, being able to use decent networking code with Windows programs
would be a major plus.

Is anyone doing anything in particular to acquire the major updates for end
of life versions of Windows?

Paul,

I saw your post and have another possible solution for your mac  
issues with case insensitivity.

Use Disk Utility to create a blank disk image, then format it with  
"UNIX Filesystem" under the erase tab. You could then use that disk  
image which will mount under /Volumes/[disk image name]/ to house  
your repository on your mac. I had to do this quite a few times  
before just having a dedicated partition with this filesystem.

Hope this might help.

I would think that sharing customer data on or off list would not be appropriate .. though maybe your customers don't mind

Huh?  Windows updates itself if you enable Automatic Updates.  How hard 
is that?  Or just use the Windows Update icon in the start menu.  Not 
sure about Win95, but Win98+ has this.

I've run XP nicely on 300Mhz machines provided they have at least 256M 
of mem.  While not blazing, it doesn't office applications just fine.

Ahh, ok.  You have a problem with the rules I see.  Yes, if you want 
Windows you must buy it, and you must buy the appropriate version 
depending on if you have qualifying products to upgrade.  How can you

Now sir, most of my reply can be taken rather harshly.  But most of your

don't like MS much either these days, but you gotta use the right reasons.

Now sir, most of my reply can be taken rather harshly.  But most of your
message is full of holes.  You're upset for all the wrong reasons.  I don't
like MS much either these days, but you gotta use the right reasons.

I'd be sharing it with somebody that I hire to help me solve my problem

a problem with that.

Microsoft does just that, yet another reason to switch to something which 
truly is stable - open source that can constantly be adjusted to fit the 
hardware that is out there and still work on older computers.

Fortunately not. Most people realized that it's much harder to clone something 
closed source and open source OS's out there are far more powerfull anyway, 
and they didn't stray long before turning to the light side ;^)

Some fail to give up the dark side and work on a Windows NT clone, in the hope 
that one day the dark side will... prevail

of course, freedos is """compatible""" but up to certain limits - it doesn't 
replace the underlying OS of windows 98.

I'm not sure whether I would buy your stock then - but with any OSS-aspiring 
OS out there, it's dubious what is the better investment in the long run when 
it comes to closed source. My bet is a fully open source OS and closed source 
applications for the enterprise, but even that sounds like a tough battle...

> At least I'd release the updates under a license that is similar

the problem with that is viral licensing effects of the GPL - once released 
you might accidentally open source closed source components - very tricky and 
lots of lawyers earn their pay from research of these type of issues these 
days ;^)

I dunno, the problem is that you didn't buy a car that was defective, and can 
demand a free repair. It's more like you bought a book, and there were typo's 
in it. If you used the book for training or worse - teaching, then you do have 
a problem when mistakes in it don't get fixed. Unfortunately the seller of the 
book may not see a financial gain in fixing the mistakes, so you end up 
editing the book yourself. The worst part is just that you don't have the 
print of the book, since it's closed source - but hey - that's what you bought 
in the first place, and you paid money for too.

I hope you get the idea...

vmware player is free, and the latest beta workstation is up for grabs too 
now, no license fees.

I stopped worrying about windows about 10 years ago, only using windows when 
my employer(s) really honestly need me to use windows applications, and at 
work. saves me lots of grey hairs...

I have a friend in *Australia* who finds the need to
use the D-Link D-200 USB modem for Internet access. It
is said to use the aciadsl chip.

This friend would like to try Linux, but for obvious
reasons my role will be limited to giving advice. Is
this modem easy to configure with Linux? If it is
fairly tricky, what is the best source of information?

oh no .. my appologies .. 

i had miss read the message and had gotten the idea (mistakenly) that you were going to help and show data.

Even at that it really isn't any of my business .. just been going through some data privacy issues with clients (some people just don't get privacy) and then I was one of the lucky ones who got their data taken our of cars from Providence Hospital .. 

Probably just really hyper sensitive now ..

Perhaps you could bring the problem to the Linux Clinic this Sunday
between 1PM and 5PM?  We're pretty busy these days and more technical
help would be appreciated, but I'll be you'll find a MySQL expert there.

Now that we have enjoyed the removable capacity of
CD's and DVD's, the next thing to come along will be
DVD HD or Blu-Ray. Will Linux have the proper support
for this technology when it is widely available? (I am
most interested in its use as a storage medium, since
I think existing DVD's are adequate for entertainment.
But is it likely that Linux will be able to decode
whatever kind of format is used by such media?)

Heh, where have you been?  This news was on all the major news sites and 
in many newspapers and magazines like 'USA Today'.  Google for 'Sony 
Rootkit' if you want more.  What is more pathetic is Sony's attempt at a 
fix, which was no attempt at all.  And if you go to an actual Sony 
store, these CD's are still sold there.

http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html

http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004145.php

That company is pure evil, and Blue Ray is only going to further help 
them.  Even if I did buy Sony products I wouldn't touch this new drive 
given the current info out on it.

http://www.tgdaily.com/2005/08/10/blu/index.html

Notable quote from the tgdaily link:

"This controversial technology would require that disc players maintain 
permanent connections to content providers via the Internet, making it 
possible for discs that fail a security check to trigger a notification 
process, enabling the provider to send the player a sort of 
"self-destruct code." This code would come in the form of a flash ROM 
"update" that would actually render the player useless..."

So go ahead and support that kind of corporation if you want.  I won't. =]

m0gely,

I only watch two things on TV... Ultimate Fighting (American Mixed 
Martial Arts fighting style) and CSI (any flavor)... so you'll have to 
forgive me. I normally do not worry about tech info on hardware until I 
am ready to purchase. As a quick glimpse goes, it looks like you are on 
the right track by steering clear of Sony... for now. Hopefully, they 
will learn a serious lesson from this, but since most people do not 
research their products first and just buy what ever Best Buy tells them 
is good, well.... I just don't see much affect from not buying their 
stuff. Of course, you will not end up with junk, so that is always a 
good thing.... Thanks for the info.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0605191054150.14425@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   OK, scannerholics. I've a question for you. The colors of scanned
photographs is way off, and I know that The GIMP is capable of correcting
them. (Note: the software has the capabilities, I don't -- yet -- have the
relevant abilities.) My question is in what format should the scanned image
be saved to facilitate manipulating it with The GIMP?

   For giggles, I scanned a photo specifying the file format as .png. When
opened in The GIMP, I could not find the sub-menu under Image that would
allow me to adjust colors, brightness, or contrast. For that matter, I could
not find that menu choice anywhere in version 2.2.8 with that format loaded.

   What sayeth you all?

I start with .tiff as my master image file, then convert to other formats from 
that. .tiff files are big, but they are best quality.

Which leads me to a shameless plug for a shiny new GIMP book, <a href=" 
http://www.shallowsky.com/">Beginning GIMP: From Novice to Professional</a>. 
It's written by a friend of mine, and it's a first-rate howto. Akkana really 
knows her stuff, the book teaches things you never knew the Gimp could do.

   I have a couple of GIMP books, but they are from the last century. I guess
that I could justify a new one.

   Well, two votes for .tiff and a great list of references from Pete ...

Message-ID: <86iro1aibt.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I am looking at capturing data from one of these nice Fluke 189
Digital Multimeters.  This particular one has an infrared interface
and an optional cable to connect to a USB port so that you can
interrogate the device for its current reading (our data collection
protocol currently has us entering an unstable value by hand, which is
proving to be quite tedious).

                     ir189usb +---------------+

Does anyone have experience with this cable, and do you know if it
works with recent linux kernels.  It is probably some kind of
usb-serial device inside, but I haven't had my hands on one yet (got
one on order).  I've found the protocol for querying the device, so it
really just boils down to the details of being able to talk across the
link.

TIA.

If they support MacOS, that is a very hopeful sign for working with
Linux. Mainly the most common mistakes with implementing the USB-storage
standard also cause problems for MacOS. This won't rule out firmware bugs
such as the one on found on Conner 1060 drives which caused problems for
ext2 (and *only* ext2!), but is still a good sign.

Simple, stable, and easy to screw up. Part of the problem was the EvilOS
driver stack for USB-storage was written from scratch, not sharing any
code with either their IDE or SCSI stacks. As a result they didn't
exercise things like multisector transfers nor command queueing. MacOS
and Linux though place USB-storage on top of their SCSI stacks, as a
result both will attempt to utilize those capabilities if the drive
indicates support.

If they only test for working with EvilOS, those flags won't be looked at
and may break other OSes (including embedded OSes on various bits of
hardware). This sort of breakage is also an issue with 1394/FireWire
devices. I was talking to an Apple Engineer at one point and he said this
was a favorite problem.

If you keep it running long enough, you'll go into the 180 days forced
fsck. With the automatic checks in place, no need.

Even with hard shutdowns it shouldn't be needed, as the journal will
contain everything needed to restore the filesystem to a consistant
state.

This though assumes your hardware works perfectly and the filesystem code
doesn't have any sort of bugs. Alas it is rare for either of these to be
true, so the forced checks are an attempt to compensate for hardware and
software that aren't perfect. Even with ECC memory you have to watch out
for bit-rot on the filesystem.

Almost certainly.  Linux plays nearly anything Windows does, with some
questionably-licensed software & DLLs.  Don't worry, DVD Jon or one of
his compatriots will take care of that.

Shouldn't both HD-DVD and Blu-ray pre-recorded discs be playable with 
the current tools?  I thought they were supposed to be backwards-compatible.

Are there even any recorders on the market yet?  I thought I saw 
something about a Toshiba laptop with an HD-DVD drive in the past few 
weeks.  There was this item a few days ago on Gizmodo about a Sony Vaio 
laptop with a Blu-ray drive:

http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/laptops/sony-vaio-with-bluray-shipping-this-summer-173775.php

But it's not out yet.

Then there's the question of blanks:  aren't Blu-ray blanks close to $50 
each?  I haven't heard how much HD-DVD blanks are going for, if there 
are any available yet.  I wonder if it wouldn't be cheaper, per GB, to 
use hard drives rather than these discs, for the foreseeable future.  
I'd also be worried about the media's reliability, at least until some 
tests are done.

I wonder if either format will really take off the way DVD did.  I 
suspect a lot of people are perfectly happy with DVDs as they are, and 
the future may lie with Internet distribution rather than overpriced 
shiny plastic discs that get tossed into landfills.  But I'm not exactly 
the market for this stuff since I don't play games and the only TV I 
have is a 12-in analog portable that is sitting in the back of the closet.

http://mobile.newsforge.com/mobility/06/05/05/2018250.shtml

Ok, it's kind of a puff piece.  But still, nice.

I learned that OSUOSL has a machine room webcam.  Don't think I'll be 
tuning in on a regular basis, though.  :-)

I am using Comcast cable modem with a Linksys WRT54G router and want to
use DDNS for web and email.  I have opened up ports 80 and 25 and mapped
them to my web/email server NAT'd IP.  How can I test the email part
without first setting up the DDNS service?  The web works fine at
http://nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn to a dummy main page.  Shouldn't I be able to send
email to user@[nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn] ?  My MTA (postfix/spamassassin) is up and
running and I can send mail locally, but when sending email to the IP, I
get the following in the sending side log:

connect to nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn[nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn]: server dropped connection
without sending the initial SMTP greeting (port 25)

Nothing in the receiving side log.  Ideas?

Sveiki PLUGinieki!

Some of you may be interested in a project I have been working on 
with a developer here in Riga while in voluntary exile.

It is a more or less drop-in replacement for FreeBSD jail but using 
Systrace on OpenBSD. This can give you either an improved chroot or 
system virtualization without surrendering significant system 
resources to Xen, UserModeLinux, VMWare and the like.

I welcome any experienced OpenBSD users (or frustrated FreeBSD users) 
to try it, punch holes in it and let me know how we can improve it 
prior to official release.

http://sysjail.bsd.lv

 From the web page:

sysjail is a userland virtualisation system for operating systems 
supporting the systrace library. It is developed on and currently 
supports OpenBSD. The first generation of sysjail is as close to a 
drop-in replacement for FreeBSD's jail subsystem as permitted. As 
with a jail, processes within a sysjail are disallowed resources 
belonging to the system proper, known as the "host" system, or other 
sysjail instances. While sysjail currently behaves as an OpenBSD 
implementation of jail, it has the potential to provide significant 
auditing, profiling and debugging tools allowing full auditing of 
intercepted system calls, run-time modification and extension of 
policies, etc. The sysjail sources are released mainly under 
OpenBSD's 3-part license.

Please say "hello" to FUP and have a Swagat lunch special for me.

Take care,

Michael Dexter

most smtp's will never send to numeric ip addresses as a precaution. if you really need to do this then you need to setup an smtp that explicitly allows this and will relay mail for you - you probably don't want to go there.

If you can get some dyndns service up you might be able to use the @host.dyndnsservice.whatever hostname instead, providing MX records are setup OK.

Bruce,

If I understand you correctly, when the computer starts it automatically 
starts Firefox, but you do not want it to start. If this is the case 
then close Firefox, before logging off of your computer and put a check 
mark in the check box that says "Save current setup".... If you want 
other programs to start automatically, then start them before log out.

Or more precisely, dyndns.com will give you up to 5 free subdomains, so
you can register with them and set up a DNS entry for hunt.dyndns.com
or frank.homelinux.com , for example.   That is good for mail testing,
*assuming* you have your SMTP server configured to respond to that
domain name.  

Note that a reverse dns query will not respond properly, and when
somebody does a reverse dns lookup on your IP address, they will
get something like c-67-171-176-23.hsd1.or.comcast.net.   Many
mailers will not talk to you if they see an RDNS entry to a dynamic
address pool like that ( mine won't, you probable spammer, you!  :-/ ).

You will want an honest-to-linus static IP address, and a reverse
DNS entry served by the machines in charge of that address block,
if you want all mailers to talk to you.  My offsite virtual server
is at 207.210.219.119, and a dig -x 207.210.219.119 reveals:

;; ANSWER SECTION:
119.219.210.207.in-addr.arpa. 3592 IN   PTR     kl-ic.com.

So I get all mail addressed to kl-ic.com., almost all mail addressed
to keithl.com (because I have a legitimate static address), and miss
some from very strict mailers that want proper RDNS even from static
addresses.  

One of the cheaper ways to get a static IP address and oodles
of bandwidth is an offsite virtual colocation server.  See my
presentation to the April PLUG advanced topics meeting at  
http://www.keithl.com/offsite.html .  You also don't bend your
Comcast terms of service and risk getting your ports blocked
or your service terminated.  

Finally, think twice before setting up your own mail domain.  When
the spammers find the domain, you will have a LOT of new friends.
I get about 30 spam attempts per minute, increasing at 15% a month.
One of the reasons for an offsite is so that I can deal with them
before they impact my tiny comcast 768K inbound bandwidth.  I have
lots of spam filtering at the offsite server, so less heads down 
the thin pipe.

Keith

PS:  it is common to obscure IP addresses in examples like this, 
but silly when a ping to keithl.com gives my IP address in seconds.

Robert,

   I'm not sure what exactly you want. A number of years ago I registered my
business domain name, then had my ISP -- Aracnet -- publish it in their DNS
servers with my static IP address that comes with my DSL service from them.

   I pay for my DSL with them on an annual basis; I don't recall how much that
is.

I use SpeakEasy with a permanent (static) IP address.  (In fact, I get two
but am only using one).

Pricing is available from their web site..... 
http://www.speakeasy.net/business/dsl/
Currently it's starting about 70$ / month.

As a note, they work with both QWest and Verizon in the local area.

Full Disclosure:  I don't work for any of the companies listed above, but
I do use Verizon phone service and SpeakEasy for my DSL at home.

If you have specific questions, you can email me off-list.

That's not strict, that's bad.  Bad mailer! Bad!

  forward(reverse($ip)) eq $ip

NOT

  reverse(forward($name)) eq $name

They must think IP's grow on trees or something.

Recently, I have experience with two providers, one local.

At home, I've been with EasyStreet since fall of 2004.  At the time I
pleaded with them to offer a product to match the Verizon 3Mb/1Mb
offering, which they did, and I think I was one of the first on this
package before it was finalized.

One static IP, downloads are fine, upstream is ~600-700Kb.  Support is
friendly, they will open the ticket with Verizon for you if there is an
outage, and every outage has been within Verizon's network.  Line+ISP
comes to ~$170/mo.

My company, OpenSourcery, has service provided by Comcast.  As a small
business and supporter of small business I have to hate Comcast, but
unfortunately they have exceeded every expectation (which in retrospect
was very low to begin with).  We have the small business service,
8Mb/1Mb, and a small block of static IP's.

A couple outages in the last 9 months.  Staff was better than expected
when I needed to set my reverse DNS for our static IP's.  Cost is ~$165/mo.

The downstream screams.  I constantly see 750-1100MByte/s downloads,
exceeding the advertised 8Mb/s down.  The upload is wimpy, and as we
depend on upstream more I may seek alternatives.

I'm hoping DSL will catch up to the cable company.  Wish I could find a
cheap DS3.  Unfortunately for EasyStreet and my ethics, FIOS is too
tempting if it arrives.  I also think asynchronous downstream/upstream
rates are a disservice to the Internet, but NANOGites and carriers would
disagree.

Kris,

Fios is a pretty good deal for
30 mg for about $200 bucks...
if you go with their middle of the road it is pretty good....
15mg down / 2 mg up for about $50...
the cheap stuff is going for $40 bucks and is the same rate as comcast 
high speed....
5 down / 2 up

The cool thing about it is that it will drive the cost of high speed 
down. Until now there really hasn't been any competition for comcast for 
those who have a choice and are data transfer informed

Still... I think I will buy into the whole fios thing as it will 
probably be cheaper per bit than cable is now.

I now use SpiritOne from what people had to say about it on this list. 
I get 4 static IP's for a few dollars a month more than a Comcast 
account.  The speed is 1.5M/896k and works great for the few sites I 
need to host.  Faster speeds are available.

   http://spiritone.com/services/dsl_pricing_soho-corp.html

I have only had the server fir a month or two now, but it's been fine.

   GnuCash has serious problems on current Slackware distributions
(unfortunately), so I switched to kmymoney2. This application is unstable
(the date keeps changing to future years; cannot type a date but must use the
spin control individually on year, month, day; transaction type reverts to
the last one used regardless of what's entered; checks to pay credit card
bills are forced to be transfers rather than checks; and it's got the ugliest
UI I've encountered in any software installed here) and I'm looking for a
replacement.

   Chris Browne's ol' CBB (CheckBook Balancer) is still available, but seems
to have had no activity since 2000 or 2001. Is anyone using it?

   I don't want any online banking or other stuff, just plain ol' double-entry
bookkeeping for checking, savings, and liabilities such as mortgages. Anyone
using something they like and will recommend?

TIA,

Woah! You got me thinking.. "I'm being raped by easystreet." (I pay
$29.95 for the ISP side but only get 1 static IP. And that's the only
way to get unfiltered access, but that's another rant.)

But looking at their site, easystreet has the same plan. Thanks!
/me calls to get the soho package

BTW, I recommend easystreet. It's nice to get a small-town feel in such
a professionally delivered service. I've never been down, excluding
qwest errors. And if you ever need to call, they don't bullshit you
(about speeds, etc). They're great peoples.

Oops, actually.. that's not true. It's another $10 for 4 IPs:
	"Multiple IP addresses: Four IP addresses are available for $10/month,
or eight IP addresses are available for $20/month (plus a one-time $10
setup)."

Go with spiritone :)

Even cheaper than a virtual colo account is a free DynDNS domain name
and a year's worth of outbound mail "smarthost" service ($15). All
your outgoing mail goes through their mail server (static IP
assignment and all that good stuff), and you can still receive
incoming mail on your own server (to your own domain).

  I have Comcast business service, not because it was my first choice,
but because it was what I could get.

  The low end Comcast business service is $75 a month with a $250
setup fee.  I was impressed by the skill of the installers.  He was
*much* more skilled than the idiot dweeb they sent out to install my
cable television.  I also got my cable television service cleaned up
in the deal.  ;-)

  My Comcast service has been stable.  I've only had one small
problem.  There was a routing issue in their network that prevented an
IPSec tunnel originating on another network from setting up.  Comcast
fixed the problem quickly... after I had already troubleshot the
problem.  I told them which router... they fixed it...

  I *tried* to get Speakeasy DSL, but I was located too far from a
POP.  There was too much copper between my place and their DSLAM.
There *is* DLS in my area, but only from Qwest.  Qwest apparently does
not give Speakeasy access to the digital SLIC in my area.

  I had a very unpleasant time getting Speakeasy to remove erroneous
billing from my credit card.  I had to speak  with a supervisor and
make nasty threats before they would reimburse my modem and
installation fee.  Bastards!  It took several months for them to
remove the billing.

Qwest DSL, aka Microsoft Network, would not provide a fixed IP.

I just went through this, although I was looking for just a personal
check register program -- no double entry needed or desired, although I
did want the ability to assign checks and deposits to expense and
income accounts and make year-end reports for the tax dude.

Like you, I started with GnuCash. Lots of problems installing in 64-bit
Ubuntu, but after upgrading to Breezy last fall and making a few tweaks
I got it installed and running. ("Missing libraries" error messages
even though the libraries were installed.) After finally getting it
installed I discovered I couldn't figure out how to use it. I futzed
with it off and on for days, but the logic of it escaped me. I do have
Accounting I and II, plus Managerial Accounting (a long time ago), but
I just couldn't grasp how to do things. Every time I tried to make an
entry I got error messages. And the documentation sucked -- "Press
Account to instantiate the account." Instantiate? Oh well. Pressing
Account didn't do anything anyway.

So then I tried Grisbi, but it was way pathetic. I thought my needs
were simple, but Grisbi was not capable enough.

Finally I found KMyMoney and I have been using it ever since. I haven't
noticed any of the problems you report. However, I have entered so far
only a couple dozen transactions, so maybe some sunny day it will up
and eat all my money. It seems to be very Quicken-like. Regarding
entering the date -- if I need to enter a date other than today's date
(it pops up with today's date by default), then I always use the
calendar thing on the right. It would be nice if it had Quicken's
ability to increment/decrement the date by typing + and -, because most
of the time you just need to change a couple of days, like when you are
posting a day or two late. But having to use the mouse is a minor
annoyance to me. I have not experienced it suddenly changing the year
on me. 

I do agree on the appearance. Looks like the artwork was done by circus
clowns. But that's KDE. I wish it were a Gnome app instead.

I also wish it could print a check. So far that has not been a major
problem, and I'm hoping that one day I will never need to write a paper
check anyway, so maybe it doesn't matter. It does seem to be able to
handle loans, credit cards and investment assets.

Having looked and looked I don't think there is anything out there
better than KMyMoney. Let me know if you find anything.

I personally use Moneydance and have been happy with it, but it is not
open-source (it is Java though, which met my cross-platform needs).
Free trial if you want to check it out.  Best ~$30 I ever spent.

That said, Gnucash for Gnome2 (which likely fixes the problems on most
distros with dependencies) is well on its way, with a public beta
(1.9.6) available.  See
http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/FAQ#Q:_Is_there_a_version_for_Gnome2.3F__When_will_2.0_be_out.3F

You've already seen their prices, but just to chime in:

SpiritOne/Aracnet(same company now) rocks. \\m// (sorry, the emoticon 
fits, cliched metal fingers and all)

Why do they rock?

1. Local presence. As in "drive into their office park location near 
the sunset highway Zoo exit" presence.
2. Ubuntu disk packs in the "lobby".
3. "Promise to pay"... I've bonked on my payments, called them up, and 
got an active internet connection in *seconds,* provided that I 
promised I would drop by the next day with cash/check etc.
4. They take cash.
5. They have a really hot, cute, gothie techie(?) girl. Cute enough to 
make me not upset about paying late, as I sometimes  see her head for a 
smoke break while I'm paying. (Okay, not relevant *at all*, but 
*damn*..)
6. Zero downtime (besides bonking, see item 3) for my user connections 
in one year. This is nice, as in Atlanta, I saw as much as 45-200 
minutes per *month* with a local ISP there.
7. The "geeks" (in the worship sense, not the derogatory sense) are 
both clueful, and honest. When they don't know what you mean by "could 
the DSLAM connection be unplugged", they do not ask you to do something 
silly like "use the Windows network wizard". Instead, they pass around 
their knowledge, and *personally* verify the circuit, ATM connection, 
etc.
8. They have VMS servers on their internal network. This means they 
have *serious* greybeards (in the worship sense, not the derogatory 
sense) around, even if they're in their 20's.

Jason,

   Thanks for the information. I had looked at Moneydance years ago and found
it to be highly finicky on which version of the jre it would accept. Then it
died as a project. I recall reading that someone bought it and was working at
recuscitating it. Glad you like it.

   I liked Gnucash. It did everything I wanted or needed, worked smoothly from
the keyboard without need for the pointy device, and produced the reports I
needed for my accountant very nicely. Yesterday, I looked at their web site,
didn't see support for gnome2 (but didn't look at the wiki). There are still
a ton of dependencies, but I will probably put up with those for a better
working solution than _I_ find kmm2 to be.

Colin,

   Thank you. It is now not readable by us peasants. I might remember next
month to see if they removed the lock.

The drive should be /dev/sda, the first partition /dev/sda1.  As root
you should be able to do an "fdisk -l /dev/sda" and see a FAT partition

   Also, in case it's not recognized as /dev/sda1, as root run 'tail -f
/var/log/messages' and see what the message is when you connect and
disconnect the device. That will confirm what you need to mount.

Another way is to install the <b>lsscsi</b> command, which tells you exactly 
how your system identifies the device:

$ lsscsi
[0:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      WDC WD800JD-08LS 07.0  /dev/sda
[2:0:0:0]    disk    LEXAR    JUMPDRIVE        1.10  /dev/sdb

***Creating a Dual-Boot Windows XP and Ubuntu Laptop 
Running a Windows-only laptop is hardly ideal for people who do
considerable work in the Linux environment. When Cygwin and ssh aren't
enough, consider at least dual-booting into the free software world.
Kevin Farnham recently converted his new laptop into a half-Windows,
half-Ubuntu GNU/Linux machine. Here's how.

***Grabbing iTMS Preview Tracks the Geek Way 
Ever tried to copy a preview track from the iTMS onto your iPod? Hint:
you can't. iTunes won't add those 30-second free previews. Why would you

there's the sheer thrill of geek accomplishment--the "oh, so that's how
to do it" satisfaction.

***Real-Time Java: An Introduction 
"Real-Time" Java doesn't mean "really fast," but it does mean "really

looks at the Real-Time Specification for Java and Sun's first
implementation of the spec.

***Configuration Management in Java EE Applications Using Subversion 
Does your enterprise Java application need to store not only complex

better option to hand the job over to a configuration management system
that is built for the task. In this article, Swaminathan Radhakrishnan
shows how you can implement requirements for change tracking by using a
Subversion repository from your Java application, by way of the JavaSVN
library.

   Because I'm so new at this stuff I'm surprised that file sizes are so
large. I just scanned a four-page brochure directly into PDF files (then used
pdftk to concatenate them into a single file). At 200 dpi, the assembled,
4-page file is 33+M in size -- in color.

   Is this because the background of each page is colored? That seems quite
large to me, but perhaps it's not.

You might be able to condense that if you first print the files to
postscript (*.ps) and then use ps2pdf to convert each postscript file into a
pdf.  Someone out on the web wrote a homemade script to convert multiple
postscript files into pdf files.  Psmerge is supposed to do this but my
experience with it has been not totally impressed.

Tim,

   I thought of taking that route to see if it made any difference. I can scan
to .ps, too, and it's easy enough to manually convert the four pages to .pdf.
I might just do that to see if the brochure does become smaller.

   Will report back to the group.

Thanks,

Rich

Sounds about right for color scans.  Yes, the background makes a big
difference, as does the fact that more color levels (e.g. 24-bit color)
means more minor variations in color values, which means less
compression.

If you want it smaller, "posterizing" the solid-color parts may help.

Using JPEG compression for the PDFs may help as well, with some loss of
quality and legibility.

   Well! That's the way to go. Apparently Xsane stuffs its pdf output as
though it was making fois gras. By saving as PostScript, then running the
result through ps2pdf the final file is about 1/10th the size of the direct
version. Hoo-ha!

Thanks,

Rich

I can't say this will help, but what you did is not the way I'd'a
dunnit. I would have scanned to TIFF files, using LZW compression. (LZW
is not lossy; it's more akin to ZIP format.) Then I'd'a placed each
TIFF onto a page in Scribus and exported the whole file as a four-page
PDF. I bet the file size would be half or less, yet the print output
resolution would be the same.

Disclaimer: I've never done this on Linux or with Scribus. I just know
it's a technique that works with equivalent tools on Windows.

My first guess would be that Xsane is creating PDFs of the scans
using uncompressed TIFFs. Is there any option to use compression, or
perhaps even JPEGs?

I have a Sun 670/mp for anyone who wants it.  It is big. It runs Linux.
It has a bunch of tape drives and other stuff that goes with it.

The catch?  You have to move it and soon.  I am moving and it needs to
go before the end of the month.

Contact me off list and we can make arrangements.

See http://pdxruby.org/ as far as FOSCON goes.  They don't have anything 
on the site yet, but there is a planning meeting coming up.  If you 
want to get involved, show up at that and/or the next meeting or just 
ping the irc channel.

Also, http://oscamp.org/ (needs editing.)  We do have a location in the 
conference hall and support from O'Reilly.  The format is wiki-camp, so 
while it's not "free presentations", it should be interesting.

Depends on your experience. It takes me about an hour for the hardware and configuring the bios. (I have built about 100PC's) 


B: Install SID
Depends on your experience and how you are going to do it. Net Install is between 1 & 2.5 hours on a cable connection.

   How quick and experienced are you at doing all this?

   I started assembling systems from parts in 1984; my last box (AMD Athlon
XP+/3200) took me about 1.25 hours (triple-checking everything and getting
the *&%#* tiny case plugs on the proper motherboard sockets). Without the
latter, it would take about 3/4-hour. And involve much smaller vocabulary.

Subject: [PLUG] SuSE 10 on Acer Laptop
Message-ID: <44770F15.2060105@comcast.net>

I have an Acer Aspire 1640Z laptop (1.7 GHz Pentium M, 1GB RAM, 80GB 
Hard Drive, DVD Burner). Naturally, it came with XP installed. 
Eventually, I'd like to end up with SuSE 10 and VMWare running XP. (For 
the foreseeable future I need to be able to run IE for work.)

I have a 10GB laptop drive I can swap for the 80 and plan to experiment 
with that. I am currently downloading the SuSE 10 DVD (only 16 hours to 
go!). Any known gotchas regarding burning the DVD image using WinXP tools?

Does anyone have any experience with this laptop and SuSE 10, or some 
other flavor of Linux?

Thanks in advance.

Windows XP does not have the ability to burn an ISO on it's own.  You 
need 3rd party software.  There is a good chance this software is 
already installed (unless you already formatted), just an FYI though.

If you need software, here are a couple recommendations:

This is a single EXE, not installation required, and free:

   http://www.snapfiles.com/get/silentnightcd.html

This ia also free, full featured, but built on .NET:

I sure do - I can't remember what model (it's about 2 months old). I 
just swapped it with a family member (who runs Windows) for a Toshiba 
instead (much happier). I couldn't stand the Acer. (FYI I used to really 
like Acer products about 12-15 years ago)

No 3d acceleration at all, the video card was a SiS760 
http://www.winischhofer.at/linuxsispart1.shtml#13.

ACPI (Also SiS based) was all screwed up. Apparently they used 
non-standard codes that windows compensated for. I found the 
instructions for getting it to work (involved updating laptop firmware) 
but never found the time and/or determination to do so. So no power-saving.

I never tried Wifi but it should've worked with ndiswrappers.

I hope you have better luck.

I'm writing this note on the French edition of a Compaq Presario 2500 
laptop running SuSE 10.0.  It has 192 mb of RAM and a 40 gb disk.  
I'm probably using about half of the disk at the moment, but most of 
this is for data.  As I recall, I did a basic workstation install of SuSE,
and then installed more manually.  I installed lots and lots of 
desktop applications, but didn't install many server applications or 
development tools or other things I didn't intend on using from a laptop.

The actual install was easy.
I was at Linux World Canada.
I was very very tired.
Had been on a airplane all night the day before and had worked at 
the conference all day.  I followed this with many glasses of fine
wine at a party that evening.
After that, I came back to my hotel room and decided to install
SuSE 10.0 on this laptop.

All went well.
SuSE 10.0 detected everything and pretty much install itself (as I slept).
And everything worked, except the ??xxx?? wireless card.  I solved
that problem by buying a Netgear WG511T which SuSE detected automatically.

Everything works great - video at 1024x768, sound, wired and wireless
networking, suspend, etc.  I'm happy with it.

Oh yes.  I don't care for the built-in mouse or the French keyboard, so
I usually use a usb mouse with it and often use an old usb keyboard 
taken from someone's X-box and I have connected usb scanners, 
cammeras, printers, and hard disks to it.  
All of this works well as well - altho the laptop only has three usb
ports so sometimes I have to use a usb hub.

The bottom line is that I'm happy with SuSE 10.0 on laptops.
I have another laptop and I may put SuSE on it as well.

I forgot to mention in my previous post that:

    -  I like SuSE, but haven't used it much on laptops as I normally
       only use SuSE when am building FAT machines and laptops are 
       a big limited in size - altho not very limited at this point.

    -  I never look at a laptop unless I can boot and run Knoppix or
       some other Linux-on-CD distro on it.
       In fact, I use a couple laptops where I simply use Knoppix on
       them.  (Their owners prefer some non-Open OS.)

    -  Until recently, I have generally installed Knoppix or Debian
       on laptops and this worked fine.
       However, my experience with laptops is limited.

My wife and I both run Thinkpad T30's with Redhat 9.  In an attempt
to upgrade, I tried loading SuSE 10 onto a spare drive in one of
the T30's.  It was a week of annoying failures, mostly due to
unexplained kernel freezes.  When I found myself debugging kernels
through serial ports, I finally gave up and moved back to RH9.  

I don't know whether I would have had more luck with CentOS 4 or
some other 2.6.X kernel distro;  I had install problems with CentOS
and the laptop and moved on to SuSE.  Sometimes you just leave well
enough alone.  However, engineers solve problems for a living;  if
there are no problems to solve, they make new ones.  ;-)

BTW, I do have SuSE 10 running on my wife's computer at work.  It
is newbie friendly, well supported, and has a nice mix of applications
for office work.  Ubuntu was a close runner up, though a little less
support and office oriented.

Booting the laptop off of a Knoppix CD, or an Ubuntu Live CD, is a
good way to learn something about its usability for Linux without
doing an entire install.  This is a good way to evaluate laptops
in the store before purchase.  If they work with the live CD, they
are probably going to work with other distros.  If they don't, move
on to the next unit and avoid a potential headache.

I can download a version of etch


Which is an ISO

Then it tells me to use

use the etch beta 2 release of the installer,

So, how do I do that???

I already have the ISO...

Or am I being too confused by the this page?

Debian releases their installer on its own as well as full distro ISO
images. If you download the installer
ISO or floppy disk images, you can install a full system over the network.
If you have downloaded an ISO and it works to install the system, that
should be all you need to worry about ;)

Right?????

If you have the file that is downloadable from
http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/etch_di_beta2/i386/iso-cd/debian-testing-i386-netinst.iso
then yes, you're able to net-install Debian etch.

Hi all.

I've seen discussions about hosting providers in the past, but I think they've all been about shared hosting so forgive me if I'm repeating a question.

I have a friend who's not exactly an expert with GNU/Linux type OSes looking for a dedicated server rental that runs a GNU/Linux OS and Cpanel. My own experience with Cpanel has been less than pleasant but he can't be dissuaded. So here's a summary of the basic requirements:

* $150-$200 max monthly (discount for prepayment is fine but the normal price can't exceed $200)
* 2.4ghz CPU minimum. AMD or Intel is fine
* 1GB RAM
* 80GB+ HDD (7200RPM IDE is fine)
* 100mbit uplink with metered bandwidth
* Cpanel
* Some Linux-based OS

Locality isn't an issue since he wants to rent hardware and won't need access to the unit. I recommended theplanet but they are outside his price range. Already off the list are Sago and LayeredTech for reliability.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions or success/horror stories!

-Aaron

Not at all. Debian's site is kind of confusing, with the many flavors of
the testing cd's that they have available, and the fact that they refer to
the cd as the Debian installer, unless you have one of the full cd's.

Thanks for all the related experiences. I've been out all day and find 
that the download is still running with another 7:16 to go. While a 
successful day, it has been a long one. I'll just let the download 
continue overnight and look at burning the dvd tomorrow.

Thanks for the warning about burning an image. There are third party 
tools on the machine which, with one exception, I haven't tried. Acer 
put a version of Ghost on the machine. They have me use it to back up 
the initial install, after going through the first time startup. They 
also have some login control in the BIOS. Looks like a DOS screen when I 
first turn it on, and it asks for my password.

I have an older copy of Knoppix I got from you, Keith, at a clinic in 
May, 2004. It starts, but hangs shortly into the process. I couldn't get 
around it with out taking out the battery! I should probably download 
and burn a newer version. ;-)

As an aside, Wine with WineTools can install IE and other Winders stuff.

I should give that a try.

While I don't technically NEED it, I do enjoy fooling around with Google 
Earth, which for now doesn't appear to come in a Linux version, and 
needs XP in the Winders department. There is a Mac OS-X version, so a 
Linux friendly one shouldn't be too hard to do. Maybe one of these days...

I use Plesk for this reason, and I purchased it myself.  The yearly 
renewal is 25% of whatever your initial cost was, and it's dead simple 
to use.  The owner admin page for cPanel scares me.  The user interface 
is very Windowsy, which is great for clients and very disarming to 
people new to admin panels.

What is a good open-source approach to serving amateur video
from a small, low-cost website?  Which formats are easy to
produce and easy for most folks to view?  What should be
plugged into Apache to serve them efficiently?

This will be for a non-profit education site, so resource
minimization is important.

Need more information:   do you mean easiest for users of the system,
or administrators of the system?  Amateur video makes it sound like
you want to allow outsiders to upload videos and there is no good
standard for everyone to be a content creator.

If you mean only for admininstrators of the system, I'd recommend
FVL/SWF (Flash) video.  Use py2swf to screen-capture desktop as Flash
video.  Or, ffmpeg to convert any format to FLV.  This is the easiest
to host and create on FOSS installations, IMHO, and most people can
play this back without a plugin installation.

Don't worry about doing anything to Apache, just serve the files over
normal HTTP.  If you need to do live, then you are probably SOL.  Live
is the tricky part, but I'd recommend stabbing yourself in the eyes
several times to prepare yourself for the pain of doing a live event
anyway.

Subject: [PLUG] SuSE 10.1 install on Acer Aspire 1640Z laptop
Message-ID: <4478EED2.4020801@comcast.net>

I found a tool on the XP installation that allowed burning ISO images 
and burned the SuSE 10.1 install dvd. I changed out the hard drives, 
switched the boot order to allow booting from the dvd drive before the 
hard drive, popped in the dvd and it booted right up, supporting the 
1200 x 800 screen.

I started the installation at 2:50 pm this afternoon. It finished around 
4:00 pm (could have been a few minutes sooner, but I was not paying 
close attention to it and it was waiting for me). I had a familiar 
problem: the machine ran fine, but would not see the network. 
Remembering that we had covered this ground before, I searched my old 
e-mails and found that the solution I used on my SuSE 9.1 installation 
was to simply run YaST and reconfigure the network card. That worked 
this time, too. I still have no idea why it is needed, or what it did 
that the install script didn't do, but it works and I can run Firefox 
and browse the network.

I have not been able to figure out why Samba won't see local Win98 
machines or the Samba service on my RH 7.0 machine. I looked at the 
various files in /etc/samba, and they all looked pretty much the same.

I do get a warning when I try to access Samba Shares:

      Unable to find any work groups in your local network. This might
      be caused by an enabled firewall.

This firewall has been mentioned, but I haven't found where it's 
controlled. The release notes make a point of saying that they are 
preliminary, so the info I need might not be there.

Any ideas on how to see what the firewall is doing would be appreciated.

Otherwise, the install looks good. I haven't heard any sound, yet. I'll 
try to look at that later on.

Qwest has static IP DSL service through Qwest.net, which is Qwest's own 
ISP.  That's not the service Qwest pushes on it's homepage -- instead, 
it pushes the home-user-oriented deal it has with MSN, which is a better 
value in price terms but sticks you with MSN as an ISP.  (So, really, 
it's not a value at all!)  But for SOHO/business accounts -- IF you 
already use Qwest for phone service, it might make sense to look at what 
kind of phone/internet service bundles you can get with Qwest/Qwest.net.

Not that I'd recommend Qwest.net over SpiritOne or Easystreet or anyone 
else ... just pointing out that there are static IP options with Qwest DSL.

Subject: [PLUG] Digital camera -- wrong choice?
Message-ID: <44798942.5040105@writemoore.net>

I'm having advance buyer's remorse ... well, not so much remorse, as 
doubts about whether I made the right choice.  I've avoided the whole 
digital camera revolution up until now, but finally decided to take the 
plunge.  After much review-reading, I decided on a Canon PowerShot S3 
IS.  There's a nice review here:

http://www.dpreview.com/news/0602/06022111canons3is.asp

The PowerShot S3 supersedes the PowerShot S2 and, as this review and 
others note, it's not a revolutionary upgrade -- mostly small 
improvements over the previous model.  I checked the gphoto2 website and 
noted that the S2 was listed as being supported; since the S3 is so 
similar to the S2, I was presuming that there wouldn't be a problem even 
though the S3 was not listed.  I figured it wasn't there only because 
it's a new model and they haven't gotten around to adding it yet.

But subsequent reading about other Canon models and Linux support has me 
wondering if that's a safe assumption.  It seems that not all model 
upgrades necessarily are supported, even when it seems like they would 
be.  I can still stop the order and make another choice if I don't 
dawdle.  Does anyone with more experience in the camera/Linux 
compatibility arena have any advice about what I should do?

If I understand what I've read correctly, is it true that another option 
would be to get a card reader and not worry about whether the camera 
itself is compatible, because I can just upload the photos from the 
memory card via USB?

I have a Sony CyberShot which is compatible with connecting to Linux.
But I find it much, much simpler to pop the memory card out of the
camera and into a USB card reader.  So, yes, this should be another
option for you.

Reading the card is the easiest.  Unless you want to use the computer to control 
the camera, for such features as time lapse, there is no reason to connect to it.

I have a Canon S2 and it is recognized by Ubuntu. It was actually easier
plugging the camera into Linux than it was XP. I didn't have to load drivers
or anything. I also have used a card reader to transfer pictures. I use both
ways equally and have never had a problem.

I full heartedly agree that dealing exclusively with reading the cards 
is the best option instead of hooking up the camera to the computer. 
When I photograph concerts, I will routinely swap memory cards in and 
out of my camera. (Canon 20D w/ BG-2 and a 70-200 2.8 IS) Then after the 
fact I drop all the photos onto my laptop. (The last concert, Caedmon's 
Call and Bebo Norman,  I shot 1026 photos!!)

With a point and shoot I wouldn't expect anybody to take that many 
photographs in one sitting; likewise, I agree with Denis's statement. If 
I were you I would get the camera that I want, and then get a couple of 
1 gig cards. (The couple is just in case you forget to remove the photos 
from one, and you want a fresh card.) If you use a laptop for a CF or SD 
card reader and it doesn't have one built in; seriously take a look at 
the PCMCIA card readers. My CF one reads faster than USB, doesn't hang 
off the side, and there are no annoying connections that *might*, *might 
not* work. (I've gone through 4 USB CF card readers.)

If you have any more questions, please let me know. Thanks.

Along with all the others, I recommend using a PCMCIA card reader.  I
bought one from, of all places, Radio Shack!  It works fine.  I wrote
up a couple of little scripts to move the files off the card, erase it,
and so forth.  There is probably great photo management software that
works with PCMCIA card readers, but I haven't learned about it yet.

Another reason for the card reader, you are not using up the battery
on the camera.  And I can be copying pix off the card while my wife
uses the camera with another card. 

A USB/Firewire cable connection might be useful if I was directing
multiple photographers at a big event, and all the cameras were
feeding a master mix console, but I don't think anyone does this
(sounds like an interesting open source app!).  And wifi would be
better for that.   Networking without a network is semi-pointless.

I keep the card reader, along with a spare memory card, along with
lots of batteries, in a small camera bag.  No cables to worry about.
The laptop is hidden in the car or back at camp, where I can suck
the pix out of the card(s) after taking a few hundred pictures.
If I was properly paranoid about the laptop (containing all those
VA medical records!) I would probably just carry lots more memory
cards.

I have a Canon A2, BTW.  Going off topic, the 2M pixel count is
fine on this older camera, I've rarely needed more.  OTOH, more
pixels use more power and memory.  What I would really like in a
camera, if I could find it in the same size, is (1) lower shutter
delay (2) longer battery life  (3) customizable persistent settings
(4) lower light levels (5) physically robust (6) 2 Mpix, not more(!) .
But you really have to dig for these specs, while everyone touts
big Mpix like infinite memory usage was the holy grail.  Unless
you spend a lot of time editing big scenes and cropping out small
segments, most of the time you will be scaling down the pictures
to fit a web page or something.  

The A2 has one very annoying "feature" - the firmware locks up if
you try to change the flash, zoom, etc. in the 2 or 3 seconds it
needs to save a picture to the memory card.  A power cycle is
needed to get it out of that mode.  Of course, such stupidity is
in none of the reviews.

One geegaw that would be nice to have on a camera would be audio
annotations - push a button and say what the last picture was
about.  Do any cameras have something like that?   Another feature
would be a "shallow suspend" mode - push a button, drop to low
power mode, push again and immediately ready to shoot.  The button
could also operate as a "picture cancel" button.  I hate waiting
10 seconds to turn the camera on, then turn off the automatic flash,
in the middle of a long event.

For web publishing, 2mp may be enough, but if you intend to print
photos, you will want significantly more. (figure the dpi you want to
print at -- 200 or 300dpi usually, and divide the max resolution of the
camera by that number: eg, if the camera generates 1024x768 images,
then you can't print images more than 5.12 inches wide at 200 dpi)

I don't mean to imply that megapixel ratings are the holy grail when
choosing a camera, I just wanted to point out how different the demands are
between digital and print publication.

The Nikon D200 allows up to 60 seconds of audio to be recorded with
each image, iirc. (You can also plug a gps into it and record your coords.
with each image too)  For what it's worth, digital slrs are much, much more
battery efficient than  point-and-shoots (generally because you don't shoot
from the lcd).  They are, of course, much larger.

My dad just got one of these: 

  http://www.leica-camera.com/digitalekameras/c-lux1/index_e.html

apparently with panasonic (??) guts, a leica lens and metal body.  Has
"ultra short shutter delay" and some kind of image stabilization
thing.  6 Mpixels though.  Very sexy and not an astronomical price.

I expect you won't have a problem.  I have a Canon A620, which has the
same processor as the S3 (DIGIC II).  It works fine under Linux
(Knoppix) and on my Mac.  digicam found the photos on it with no
problems.

Also, as others said, if you need to you can get a separate SD card reader.

Have fun with that 12x optical zoom!  Whew!

A couple of things.  First, you are assuming that better battery life
is tied only to the MP count, and leaving out the improvements in
technology.  My new Canon A620 gets amazing battery life, despite the
7.1MP.  It is also smaller, has a better display, boots incredibly
fast, takes pictures faster, and can take 640x480 movies at 30fps for
unlimited (except by card size) periods of time.

Second, the size of the image is adjustable on the camera.  While the
default is the largest size, you can certainly set it to take much
smaller pictures, including a mode that is designed for web-sized
images.  I never use it, because I am of the mindset of take the
original at maximum size/quality, and scale down via software, in case
I ever decide sometime in the future that I want that image for
something else.

Again, the boot times of cameras is in the more in-depth reviews, just
not on the crappy consumer reviews.  The Canon A620 boots from off to
first image in 1.6 seconds.  Not sure what more you would want than
that.  I haven't found the audio annotation feature, so this camera
might not have it, but I've definitely seen others that do.

I used to shoot with a Fuji FinePix A205 (2MP) and have printed up to 16 
x 20 with good results (at least for that one picture!), several at 8 x 
10, and many at 4 x 6. The 4 x 6 are, of course, great. The 8 x 10's 
aren't bad, either.

My biggest complaint about point and shoot is that it's point and shoot. 
What I really wanted was an SLR, so I got a Canon Digital Rebel. The 
first time I tried using it with Digikam, it found it right away. I 
always just download from the camera to my hard drive, and then recharge 
the camera's lithium-ion battery.

Message-ID: <20060528211810.GA5663@gate.kl-ic.com>


One of the companies I deal with provides passworded ftp access.  They
recently broke passive FTP, and had only active FTP, which made it hard
to upload files from behind a NAT Firewall at a third-party site.  I got
them fix passive, but not before we explored the idea of SFTP/SCP file
transfer.

The problem with SFTP and SCP is that they are wrappers around SSH, and
properly using SSH at the remote end requires a shell account, which 
they do not offer for security reasons.  Yes, I know they could offer
chroot jails or some such, but let's leave that complication off the
table for now.

They are using BSD.  Are there any SSH-like SFTP/SCP server daemons
that will work without shell accounts, that use SSH protocol and talk
to the SFTP and SCP commands, but behave more like FTP in not requiring
a shell account?

Most newer digital cameras support USB Mass Storage.  They show up as
a flash drive to the computer.  Mine works this way, showing up as a
slow flash drive.  I usually use a memory card reader like others
since it is much faster and doesn't use up the battery.  I couldn't
find anything online about the Canon PowerShot S3 IS supporting mass
storage but I am guessing that since it is newer, it should support
it.

Older cameras used just PTP (or even worse a proprietary protocol) to
transfer pictures. gphoto2 speaks PTP and some proprietary protocols.
It looks like the Canon PowerShot S3 definitely supports PTP and can
likely be used with gphoto2 in PTP mode.

The Shuffle has received less than hearty reviews. It's the least liked
of all the iPod models. Having said that, it should work just fine with
Linux. I have a 60 GB iPod and my only big problem has been mounting
and unmounting. (But I have that with everything. I have trouble
seating myself in my easy chair.) Your Shuffle will play any mp3 just
fine.

As it turns out I have been having a conversation with someone on the
Ubuntu 64-bit forum regarding mounting his Shuffle. He finally got it
"sorted" (Londoner). As far as using it, just mount the thing, open
gtkpod, and transfer mp3s to it. The only caveat is being damn sure you
unmount it before unplugging it. Failure to do so is a good way to
upgooberate the Apple iTunes database. If that happens you get to go
find a Windows box with iTunes installed on it, because that's the only
way you're going to be able to reformat and restore the database. Got
the t-shirt on that one.

Oh, and be sure you save your mp3s somewhere that you can back them up
from. Sooner or later you *will* screw up your Shuffle.

it plays mp3's just fine, the item shows up as a general usb stick - one large

Jason, you are assuming that you know what I am assuming, and that
leads to madness.

What I *know* is that, *all other things being equal*, the power cost
of storing and moving bits goes up with the number of bits, in a
higher-than-linear fashion.  That is just physics - and I can show
you detailed engineering calculations as to why this is so (I design
chips).  Granted, the power and delay go down with improved technology,
but I would rather take the improvements in longer battery life and
lower shutter delay and bigger light buckets for the pixels, leading
to better low-light sensitivity. Yes, cameras are getting better at
the non-banner specs while they increase in pixel counts, but I would
prefer a camera that gets A LOT better at the non-banner specs with
no increase in pixel count.

I'm sure many people are impressed by a simple big number for
pixels, but I want fast and easy point and shoot, with long battery
life and no 5-minute power-down nonsense, and I would like to be
able to buy a camera with those parameters optimized.  I have never
had a shot spoiled by being too grainy, and I have had hundreds of
shots spoiled by blur, or lost by not getting the photos fast
enough, or running out of memory.  As it is, I must take what
I want (improved non-pixel-count performance) with a banner spec
that makes my desired parameters worse than necessary.

But then, big cars and big houses and big TVs and big bombs and
bloatware programs don't impress me either.  Color me offbeat.

Jason continues:

Those modes save transfer time and memory area, but the camera is
still moving all the pixels internally, and the light buckets on
the imager are still smaller.  So the reduced pixel modes are
slightly "less worse", but not as good as big-bucket pixels or
smaller internal transfers.  Can you make these "smaller picture"
modes persistent between camera power cycles, or is this just
another setting you have to make at every power-up?

I want persistent state between power cycles.  True, the A20 camera
goes from power button to lens extension in about 2 seconds, but then
I have to turn off the $%$^# flash and re-adjust the zoom - it takes
about 10 seconds to do all that.  This is especially annoying if the
reason I am going though all this effort is because the camera decides
to power down while I am waiting for the right shot.  Hence my concern
about power; the folks who designed the camera were compensating for
the huge power drain during the time the camera is imaging and 
displaying on the LCD.

Again, I would like a variety of camera that does what I want, not
what 70% of the population thinks they want.  I look forward to the
day that cameras start using imbedded Linux, so I can make one work
to my tastes.  Most of my annoyances stem from firmware design
choices.  I suspect I will be stuck with more pixels than I want
until they start manufacturing them for the deeply poor parts of 
the third world, to go along with their $100 OLPC laptops.

I can almost open and take a picture with my 1930's era folding camera
faster than 1.6 seconds.  I want my 2006 digital camera to come on
INSTANTLY and to take a picture the MOMENT I press the shutter button.
I've not yet seen a digital point and shoot that can do that.

Fair 'nuff.  I will concede there is always room for improvement.  To
me, 1.6 seconds seems fast.

Well those were extraordinarily encouraging responses!  Thanks all, for 
the reassurance.  I guess everyone didn't go away for the Memorial Day 
weekend, like I'd feared.  Or if y'all did, you took your laptops/PDA's 
with you.  :-)

A couple of things, in response to comments:

I picked this camera after getting lost in a sea of professional-level 
and consumer-level reviews and user comments about a dozen or three 
different models.  I don't know if you've heard of Barry Schwartz's book 
"The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less," about the paralyzing nature 
of having too many choices, but never have I felt it so acutely.  Here I 
thought choosing a Linux distro was tough.  So I'm in no position to say 
"this is the perfect camera, regardless of whether Linux will recognize 
it" -- truth is, there are probably several models that would suit me 
fine, especially as I'm more-or-less a beginner.  This one seemed to 
have the best balance of features I was looking for based on what types 
of photos I think I'll be taking.  I wanted a bit more than a standard 
point-and-shoot, but I didn't think I was ready for (nor ready for the  
extra expense of) a dSLR.  The video mode wasn't something I necessarily 
was looking for and I probably won't use it much, but I think it might 
be nice to have, and it seems to be a specialty of Canon's.  (You can 
even take a still shot while shooting video with this camera.)  The 
audio settings are almost on par with some camcorders; this is about as 
close to a camcorder as I ever plan on getting.  The battery life is 
amongst the best in this class of camera -- more than 500 shots from 
charged-up NiHM batteries -- and it takes standard AA batteries, which 
was an important factor.  I know a lot of people prefer proprietary 
lithium cells, but personally I think standard batteries can always get 
you out of a pinch.  You can always find AA batteries if you need them.  
The 6MP ought to do me just fine -- to paraphrase Bill Gates, that's as 
much as anyone should ever need.  The 12X zoom ought to be really cool, 
and if I want, it has the option of adding wide-angle with another 
lens.  I wonder, though, if you start going in that direction, if you 
aren't better off with a full-on dSLR.  Beyond a certain point of 
feature-glut, it begins to seem like you're compensating for not getting 
what you really want, and lower-end dSLRs aren't so much more expensive 
than a camera like this + add-ons, if you look for deals.  If I'd been 
thinking along those lines, I probably would've looked harder at the 
Digital Rebel, Nikon D70, or similar.

I do wish the 2" LCD was a 2.5" LCD instead, and the electronic 
view-finder is reputed to be a weak point, but the grip of the camera 
makes up for it.  All the features and image quality considerations 
aside, just holding the thing was probably one of the biggest factors 
for me.  It felt right, slightly meatier than some of the similarly 
built Canon models.  I liked fondling it.  :-)  I'm sure there will be 
as-yet-undiscovered annoyances, but in general it seems to get a lot of 
the details right -- very fast boot-up, manual flash, usual array of 
nifty-or-not Canon features (menu system, IS, color gimmicks), nice 
control layout and range of ISO modes (though ISO 800 seems all but 
useless, given the results).

So all-around it seemed like the best bet for me, but there are numerous 
other models I would probably be fine with if there was some 
show-stopping problem with this one.  I ordered a 1GB high-speed SD card 
to go with it, since this comes with a pathetic 16MB card.  (Why do they 
do that?  Why do they even make 16MB cards still?)  Good to know I can 
just get a card reader if the camera isn't recognized, or get one even 
if it is, since as many of you pointed out, using that method has its 
advantages.  I may have more questions about what exactly to get, but 
I've exhausted my decision-making capacity this month.  Next up: card 
readers and photo-management software.  I note Google has just released 
Picasa for Linux.  Maybe the timing is a sign?  Those nice folk at 
Google are thinking of me?

I'm gonna want a laptop one day in the not-too-distant future, and I've 
been thinking about getting a bicycle.  It would really come in handy, 
since I don't have/don't want a car and Portland is a lot less dense 
than New York.  I got used to having everything I needed within a 
five-block radius in New York; not the case here.  And if I do get a 
bicycle, I'll probably want a portable MP3 player.  Maybe that's one 
case where I can just go with the clear market leader and not even 
consider the alternatives.

My head hurts already.  At least budgetary considerations mean I have to 
put off some decisions for later!

One thing I never got used to on my Fuji FinePix was how the mode switch 
could be thrown without my noticing. It has three positions, take 
pictures, review pictures, record video. Normally I would leave it in 
the take pictures mode. On several occasions I would discover that in 
pulling the camera out of the case I wore on my belt I was recording 
video! It became obvious when it wouldn't take a still picture.

Yours will probably be different, but that's the kind of thing you might 
run into.

I use WordPress. It is pretty good. I had the ability to install a few 
blogging software, but chose WordPress because I others told me about 
it. I am happy with it. BTW, do you know that appl-ecosys.com is the 
apache test page?

I use WordPress for my main blog (www.ridenbaugh.com) since last October  
and I've had good luck with it - install was pretty easy, and there's good  
community support. It has been easy to use, is fairly flexible, and allows  
for easy backups (sent nightly via email). My website server uses Linux,  
and I'm told the compatibility is good.

I recently set up Nucleus (www.nucleuscms.org) for a friend
(www.china-soup.com), and it was easy to set up and it's easy to use. It
handles images well by default, and there are tons of decent (but not
great, to my taste) skins available. You can have multiple submitters,
comments can be disabled, and the admin system is not too clunky.

Just another data point.

Christian,

   Thank you. It's also free (as in beer) which makes it a good value for a
beginner.

   No. When I type "http://www.appl-ecosys.com/" into firefox here I get my

Rich,

You need to ask Aracnet to add a CNAME to your zone record which has
your domain without the www prefix. It'll take Sean two minutes.

Sandy,

   Thanks; I'll do this. Sean is a gem of a SysAdmin. He's been exceptionally
helpful for years. I doubt that they pay him enough.

Keith,

I use rssh when I want to give someone SCP/SFTP access but not shell
access:

http://pizzashack.org/rssh/security.shtml

Each user is still required to have a system account, but if you set
their shell to rssh, they cannot login interactively over SSH -- all
they can do is SCP and SFTP.

Speaking of security issues..

Rich: if you get anything php-based, make sure to subscribe to their
accounce list. You'll be updating, or discovering that your server is
suddenly a huge spam source.

I personally use serendipity. It's the best looking, IMHO, and upgrade are

Charlie,

   I know that the Slackware security team has put out several php upgrades to
patch vulnerabilities. I believe that WordPress uses CSS and XHTML rather
than PHP to render pages.

   So many choices ... and each has its collection of happy users.

   The issue of "best looking" is so subjective that I won't touch that at
all. :-) Since they all have skins (thick or thin) and themes, looks can be
changed with the weather.

Thanks for the suggestions,

Rich

   Well, it uses php in some parts (such as the header).

   Is this an issue with the application itself or with the hosting site?

I have a Cannon Power Shot A70.  I did a bunch of research on Linux,
and digital cameras a while ago.  There are basically two support
issues one of which I haven't seen in this thread yet.

The first one camera compatibility with Linux has not been a problem
with me.  This comes in one of three flavors.  gphoto2 support.  When
cameras first came out everyone had their own driver.  Now there is a
standard driver that most cameras use.  It is usually either called
PTP (picture transfer protocol), or pictbridge.  I think it is better
than USB mass storage because it doesn't depend on the computer
supporting the filesystem used on the memory card.  This isn't much of
an issue now as everyone is using fat, but fat has known limitations,
and as the memory cards start getting big enough to make these
limitations an issue I expect different filesystems to start being
used.  Many cameras let you switch between USB mass storage mode, and
PTP mode.  PTP also lets you download thumbnails without downloading
the whole image, and has a variety of other features.  Some Canon
cameras let you use the PTP interface to trigger the camera to take a
picture.  So the first to camera compatibility methods are PTP, and
USB mass storage.  The third method discussed here is memory card
readers.

The second compatibility issue is support for the camera's raw data
format.  Cameras do various tweaks on the data before saving images.
Kind of an automatic photo retouch.  Professionals mostly use the raw
data format of the camera which is much better for post process
manipulation.  More info about that here.  [1]

In any case I just plug in my camera, and I get a popup in Linux that
asks me if I want to import photos, and it just works.  When I first
used my camera it was a big headache, but that's all fixed now.

I hope this helps a little

This is an apache configuration problem.  My browser asks DNS for
"appl-ecosys.com" (note the LACK of www prefix ) and gets Rich's
IP address, 216.99.206.23 .  Rich already has the proper CNAME set up.
The browser then sends an HTTP request for "appl-ecosys.com" to
the apache server, which responds with the default apache page,
because apache only knows how to respond to "www.appl-ecosys.com".
                                             ^^^
So the proper thing to do is to edit httpd.conf ( I think located
at /etc/apache/httpd.conf for Slackware ) and set up ServerName
and ServerAlias properly in the right VirtualHost stanza. 
For kl-ic.com, I have:

<VirtualHost 207.210.219.119:80>
   ServerName kl-ic.com
   ServerAlias *.kl-ic.com
   DocumentRoot /home/www/kl-ic
</VirtualHost>

So if I ask for "banana.kl-ic.com" (which I have a CNAME for),
apache will serve the default kl-ic.com page.  If I ask for
"apple.kl-ic.com" *the browser* will tell me it cannot be found,
because I have no CNAME for that - DNS cannot find a machine
named apple.kl-ic.com.  Without a CNAME, the browser never gets
as far as my apache server.

Note, I use VirtualHost because I have a complex site;  about
10 domains and 20 different index pages served (like wikis
and subversion trees, as well as some intranet stuff).  It 
"jest grew".  It is good to start out using Virtual Hosts if
you might be expanding in the future, or merely if you want to
separate your personal and professional pages.

After getting httpd.conf fixed, just type "apachectl graceful"
and all will be well.

   Thank you very much, Keith. I'll ask Aracnet to make that change since they
host my web site.

He doesn't appear to:

www.appl-ecosys.com.    83669   IN      CNAME   www.aracnet.com.
www.aracnet.com.        83669   IN      A       216.99.193.8

appl-ecosys.com.        83798   IN      A       216.99.206.23

These are clearly not the same servers.

Blogger is easy if you don't want to install anything on your website. You
can publish to your website from the blogger.com website via ftp. I happen
to like Textpattern www.textpattern.com but only because it allows you
complete control over the style. Its essentially just a publishing system
without any type of template engine.

I got a notice on the Scriibus e-list that there was a new version, 
which included a new repository for .deb files. Thinking that it might 
help me get the latest version installed on my Ubuntu-64 Breezy 
laptop, I opened Synaptic and tried to add the repository. That 
didn't work, but in the process I noticed that there were additional 
repositories for Ubuntu Updates and for Security fixes. These 
repositories had not been enabled. I wondered why I had not been 
seeing the little "new updates available" icon for a long time. So I 
added them, then updated Synaptic. Following that I saw the "new 
updates available" icon. I closed all running programs and then 
clicked on it. It listed 230 packages. I decided to go ahead and let 
it do the updates. BIG MISTAKE!

Fifteen minutes later it finished. I decided to reboot just to make 
sure everything was cool. Normally when my computer boots it 
lists all the things it is doing, but it does so in "normal" mode or 
something. This time it listed everything in like "verbose" mode. 
Miles of messages scrolled past. And then, just as I thought it was 
about to go graphical, I got a horrible error message: FAILED TO 
START X WINDOWS SYSTEM, Unable to locate NVIDIA driver.

I found myself at a command line. No GUI. Note that I installed the 
Nvidia proprietary driver some time ago, and it had been working 
fine. But I also noticed something in one of the 230 packages 
referring to Nvidia. Undoubtedly that is what caused the current 
problem. I wish there was a "rollback" option to undo the updates. I 
tried rebooting one more time, but got the same results.

If I were a command line guru I bet I could fix it. But I know next to 
nothing of the command line. Plus I have no idea why the Nvidia 
driver is not where it is supposed to be, nor do I even know where it 
is supposed to be or what it is called.

At this point I am thinking about my old hard drive. Those who were 
at the last clinic may recall that I replaced my hard drive then. My 
old one is sitting here and it would work fine if I just stuck it in. I do 
have some new homework files created in the past week or so, but 
I bet I could figure out how to mount my other USB drive that I use 
for backups and copy them over. Then I could copy them back to 
the old drive after swapping. But that is not the best solution. A 
better idea would be to fix what is wrong with the "updated" 
installation. 

Anyone have any ideas where to start? I'm really pretty desperate 
here!

You probably just need to install the proprietary driver again. The module
needs to be rebuilt every time a new kernel is installed.

Drew,

   Thanks for the insight. I'm going with WordPress and will host it with my
web site ... both handled by the super folks at Aracnet (a.k.a. SpiritOne).

It shouldn't be too hard.

First step, get the driver:

wget
http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-8762/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8762-pkg1.run


Next, install the driver. Should only require typing "sh
NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8762-pkg1.run"

You might have to be root to run it. It should give you some output if
something doesn't go right. You shouldn't need to change any
configuration, and you should be able to start the server after running
modprobe nvidia (or rebooting if nvidia was set in autoload).

As another mentioned, you can probably re-install the Nvidia
driver and succeed.  If not, clues can be found in the
/var/log/X<mumble> log file.

May I also suggest you develop a backup strategy?  Two important
aphorisms: "If you only have one copy of something, pretty soon
you will have zero copies of something", and "shit happens". 
You may not be so lucky next time, and Linux as root like is
a 10 horsepower concrete drill;  very powerful, very deadly!

If things get incurably wedged, it is no great tragedy to reinstall
Windows - people expect that, and it is part of Bill's revenue
stream.  Reinstalling Linux - Oh, the Penguinity!  

Make backups.

Yeah, yeah. I should have used Kdar before doing the updates. But then, I knew that the only things that had changed since replacing the hard drive at the clinic were a few homework files. And those I have paper copies of and they're only a few pages long each. Worst case scenario, I'm OK. And, while waiting for responses I was able (from the command line) to mount my USB drive that I use for backups and then copy my entire /home directory to it using cp. Once I did that I breathed a sigh of relief.

Actually, I am back up and running already. 

I posted the same message on the Ubuntu-64 forum and a kind soul told me how to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf to change the line that says "nvidia" to "nv," thus switching back to the open source driver. Took me a few tries because he gave me instructions for vi, but I couldn't figure out how to save from vi. He said to save and exit with Esc, but that did nothing. However, he also said I could use nano, and nano had a menu thingy on the bottom telling me how to save and exit. I successfully edited the file and saved it. When I rebooted the GUI is back!!!!!! Yay!!

However, the next thing I noticed was that I got a lot of error messages while booting about ndiswrapper. Going into System > Administration > Networking I quickly noticed that wifi was not there any more. <Sigh>

But this time I had the answer at my fingertips. You see, last time I went through this I had a lot of e-mails back and forth from people on the Linux R3000 e-list until I finally got it working. So when I finished getting it working I took all the e-mails, concatenated them into a big document, and posted it on the R3000 wiki page. So all I did this time was go back to the page and walk through my instructions. I am happy to report that wifi with ndiswrapper is now working again. <Whew>

Now all I need to do is get the proprietary Nvidia driver back so I can play DVDs. But I have the web page with instructions for that bookmarked, so I should have no problem.

Man, this stuff is sometimes SO scary! Thanks for the help!

Don't you feel empowered now? :-)  Knowing how to use the command line 
is like that.  Anyone else remember having "windows won't start" 
episodes and not knowing what to do about your data besides wring your 
hands?

While I'm here, I'll second the "must reinstall nvidia driver".  Odds 
are you "suffered" a kernel upgrade.

Run "uname -a" to learn the version of your current kernel.  When that 
changes, reinstall the nvidia drivers (chances are, keeping that .run 
file handy in root's home directory is a good way to know exactly how 
to get out of this again -- you might occasionally have to download an 
upgrade, but I bet any given .run will survive a few minor kernel 
versions.)

Worst case might be that you need to aptitude install your kernel 
headers.  The important part is not to panic.  Everything will be fine.

Most things should always work fine, it's only things that have special
modules that are expected to break.

I see from later messages that you managed to solve your issue.
Nonetheless, here's a suggestion for future reference.  It's very likely
that your kernel update did not remove the old kernel, it just added a
new one and made that the default.  Using grub boot menu, you should be
able to boot your old kernel with the working nvidia driver.  This would
allow you to get back to a working X11 configuration and debug the
problem from a familiar environment.

Note that I've never run Ubuntu, so I can't guarantee that this will
work, but I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong.

Another good suggestion for a solution. Except that I'd have to know
how to edit the grub boot menu from the command line.

Thanks for answering

What I done so  far

Install Postfix

Install Apache with PHP

Install IMAP

Install SquirrelMail


So I do 

localhost/squirrelmail

nothing....

So I try  /usr/share/squirrelmail/src/configtest.php

And firefox says..  

Hey it's a script??

I have done the 

squirrelmail- config..

That looks right <I never ran  this before so take that with a grain of
salt>???


I do 

telnet localhost 25

And I get message from Postfix...

and if I just do localhost <with firefox> apache comes up...

If you have followed this rambling..

I don't know where to look to help myself..

Apache seems to be running

Postfix seems to be running.

PHP doesn't seem to be running

Maybe I need Apache PHP something???


Thanks for listening

By doing what you just did.  Screw something up.  It means you have to 
fix it.  And you did, and you're a little bit more knowledgeable about 
this than you were yesterday.  It helps to have a goal.

Yup.  It doesn't come overnight.  Unless you toasted your machine and
you really need it the next day.  Then it does come overnight.  With a
lot of coffee.

When you boot the laptop, immediatly after the bios flashes by you may
be presented with a list of options to boot into -- this is where
you'd choose to boot into Windows if your laptop is set up to
dual-boot.  That list will often have entries for all your old
kernels, allowing you to boot into a "last known good" configuration
(of sorts).

If you don't have such an option, then yes, you do need to edit your
grub menu config file, but it's no more scary than the x.org file you
already edited.  (note: you need to edit the grub file *now*, as
_usually_ when you need this option, you *can't* edit the file.)  Just
incase you're concerned about this option interrupting the bootup
process -- typically grub is set to auto-select a default after 3-5
seconds.

Regarding your first email:  You mention using your usb backup and an
old drive to get around your problem, and in that comment you elude to
not knowing how to restore from the backup.  I strongly suggest you
figure out how to do that, and store the step-by-step instructions in
a place you can access them with out using the computer in question.
(Paper works well :).  I make more mistakes when I'm rushed and
harried, which is often the case when restoring backups.

As I was analyzing the command you are using to try and mount your flash 
disk, I noticed that you only gave the name of the device you want to 
mount. This will only work if you have an entry for that device listed 
in /etc/fstab. If you don't, you need to specify some more options to 
mount your disk.

        First, you need to specify the type of the disk being mounted, 
which is specified by using the '-t' option. Second, you need to specify 
the name of the disk you want mounted, which might be /dev/scsi0 in your 
case. Last, you need to spcify where you want your disk mounted. The 
desired directory must exist beforehand. In your case, you might try 
creating a folder in /media called 'Jumpdisk' by using the following 
command from a command shell as root:

#  mkdir /media/Jumpdisk

       The full command to mount your disk should be something like this:

$  mount -t vfat /dev/scsi0 /media/Jumpdisk

       This might not work for regular users because of how secure Linux 
is. If this is the case, you have two options: (1) run the mount command 
as root or (2) append the following line to your /etc/fstab file:

/dev/scsi0      /media/Jumpdisk     vfat    
defaults,shortname=winnt,user   0       0

       This can be quickly accomplished by executing the following 
command from a root shell:

#  echo /dev/scsi0      /media/Jumpdisk     vfat    
defaults,shortname=winnt,user   0       0 >> /etc/fstab


       I would recommend that you take the 2nd option because it permits 
you to use your jumpdisk as a regular user while keeping everyone except 
the root from messing with your jumpdisk.

       I hope this helps. Let me know if my commands don't make sense to 
you. There are NO stupid questions except the ones not asked. ;)

Actually, one of the beautiful things about grub is that it gives you
a command-line where you can do *lots* of things, including edit the
various boot options or compose one entirely new.  You can't save
these, but you can mutate on an adhoc basis all you want.

I just put together a grub boot floppy that configures itself to
operate over a serial console.  This will let me boot up random
hardware without a monitor/keyboard attached as long as the box has a
floppy drive and a serial port.  I'll need to hunt and peck around to
find the right root partition and kernel (grub does filename
completion, so tab is your friend), but it is immensely flexible, and
it'll let me get root on a box that by an oversight I previously did
not have.  You could do the same thing with a CD instead of a floppy.

Grub rocks.

John,

When you install a new kernel (by apt-get install kernel-image***), the 
old kernel is not removed. You can select either kernel to boot from. 
When I upgraded from 2.4. to 2.6, I lost my wifi connection, but booting 
into the old kernel I had it, so it is important to keep the old kernel 
around until you know that everything will work correctly and then 
remove it (by apt-get remove kernel-image-old-one). The more I screw up 
my system the more I know how it all works together and the more I 
install things that are foreign to me like apache and get them to work 
the more I learn.

Next step is to read log files.  Does your default error file say things of
interest?  404 in the access (comb) log?

Hey All,

I'm in charge on an FC4 box here at work but don't have control of
anything else on my employer's network (UPS, other servers, etc.)
Every once and a while the power goes out and taking my machine, DHCP,
and NIS with it.  My server comes up faster than the others making it
inaccessible till I can physically go to it and reboot it.  Does
anyone have a suggestion on how to insure that my server comes up in
working order?  My only idea is to write an init script that sleeps
for 5 minutes that can be bypassed somehow when the extra wait time
isn't needed.  Any thoughts?

if the devices that you depend on being there first
have a network connection, you can test via things
like SNMP for their status. The UPS's that don't
have their own network connection sometimes have
serial<->SNMP options, and there are serial port
drivers as well. some other devices get tricky,
such as CSU/DSUs. There I use to test for something
upstream from them such as a router.

in init.d or equiv. make your script be one that runs
before those that depend on the other stuff being
up. I'm not sure about Linux, but maybe one way to have a 'dont want to wait
flag' set via grub, and make it one of the
options in grubs boot screen

Here's the situation:
Many donated newer pc's and laptops need to have linux installed, but I 
would like to have an image of a current perfectly working laptop with

need to know is:
1. How can I make an image file of the entire drive that can be put on a

2. How do I install from the image?
3. do i need a special boot disk to accomplish this?
4. should i make a local repository? Or will the local image be just fine?

By 'working order' you mean that it gets networking set up, right? 

You can use ifplugd to make sure that everything that needs networking
gets started when the network is available.

If you have a budget for this, use a network power switch and have the
DHCP or NIS server hit the switch to turn your server on after it has
initialized.

You might need to enter the appropriate PHP modules in httpd.conf. 
Squirrelmail is just a big ole PHP script, so you need to get PHP working 
first. 

Uncomment

#AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
#AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

Then you'll need to configure your usual virtual hosts. Then a nice trick is 
to create a softlink to a /webmail directory, so users can go to 
domain.com/webmail:

# ln -s /usr/share/squirrelmail /var/www/webmail

Squirrelmail installs with a raft of help docs, so be sure to dig them out.

It's a proof of concept, likely to be followed up by more with actual payloads.

You can also set up an alias in squirrelmail.conf to take care of
that...

    Alias /webmail /usr/share/squirrelmail

I assume by "localhost/squirrelmail" you mean you're pointing your
browser at http://localhost/squirrelmail as opposed to trying to invoke
it from the command line (nod yes).

You can test to make certain you've got Apache w/PHP configured
correctly by creating the following simple php page (call it
info.php)...

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

...and pointing your browser at it. It should yield a wealth of
information about your PHP configuration.

Jason,

   Am I correct in assuming that a recipient would have to open the OO.o/S.O.
document and run the macro in order to activate the malware?

   I will not pretend to comment for anyone else, but I would not save an
attachment unless it was from someone I knew and was expected. Even then, I'd
probably look at it with a text editor first.

May I modestly suggest a recent series I wrote on using Debian pre-seeding.

Automate Linux Installations with Debian Pre-Seeding
http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netsysm/article.php/3606721

Automate Linux Installations with Debian Pre-Seeding (Part 2)
http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netos/article.php/3608361

The traditional tool for Debian is FAI, which is wickedly difficult to learn. 
Using pre-seed files is a lot easier, and accomodates diverse hardware 
nicely.

Rich,

If you've got Oo config'd safely, you would be correct. See the followup

Sounds like you might be wanting a thin-client type solution.  See:

  <http://www.ltsp.org/>

or

One possibility is to increase the timeout of the DHCP client.  By
default, it is 60 seconds.  If you increased it to 5 minutes, the
client would sit waiting for the DHCP server to respond.  I think the
config file is /etc/dhclient.conf.

The other solution I can think of is have a startup which runs last
and checks if the network and all the services are working.  It would
either restart them by switching runlevels or reboot the whole
machine.

Thanks, but I am looking for an easy way to do mass installs from an

Your solution is likely to be similar to the ltsp boot process.  


Client runs some sort of network boot from ROM, typically PXE boot.

Server dhcpd hands client an IP address, tftp server and boot file name.

Client downloads boot file from tftp server.

Client boots from downloaded file.


For your needs the boot file could contain a stripped down kernel and
init whose sole purpose is to pull a disk image from the network and
dd it to the disk.

So now I can go to 


http://localhost/webmail/squirrelmai.

And I get the login screen

Now to figure out how to create an account..

I have done

/usr/sbin/squirrelmail-configure.   

That doesn't  add users..  must be some other place

Use system users.  Like your normal login on the box.

If you don't have a domain, why would you want to configure
squirrelmail? Its purpose is to allow you to read/send email when you're
away from your server but have access to the web. Do you have a fixed IP
you would use to do that?

As far as IMAP goes, you need to have that configured correctly before
it's useful to squirrelmail. See if this helps...

(assuming you're running courier imap)

test environment ?

might not be directly related, but some MTAs want to play
with something that looks like a domain. Setup bind to
have a domain like mydomain, so your smtp addy likes like
me at mydomain.

Good. Fast. Cheap. O'Reilly Launches PDF Guides

As part of O'Reilly Media's commitment to delivering vital technology
information to people who need it, when they need it, O'Reilly is
launching an ongoing series of PDF publications to address cutting edge
technologies. O'Reilly's PDF guides are in-depth, immediate, timely, and
authoritative. Readers can purchase and download the PDFs through the
O'Reilly online store, with no restrictions on the ability to save, copy,
or print them.

The advantages to readers are numerous. O'Reilly authors can disseminate
crucial information as the need arises, without having to wait for enough
material to fill an entire book. Production time is reduced dramatically,
giving IT professionals and others immediate access to the knowledge they
want. Plus, readers can easily search the text, copy and paste handy bits
of code into their applications, and take the PDF with them even when
they're offline. But most importantly, readers won't have to compromise in
their pursuit of timely information--these PDFs provide the high-quality
content for which O'Reilly has come to be known.

This month's PDF offerings are available now:

"Build Tag Clouds in Perl and PHP" by Jim Bumgardner
First popularized by the web sites Flickr, Technorati, and del.icio.us,
these amorphous clumps of words now appear on a slew of web sites as

them effectively, and then shows how to collect tags and display them in
the tag cloud format. Scripts are provided in Perl and PHP.

frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, developers can easily create web service
clients and servers with fewer errors. This guide looks at how Ruby on
Rails makes building web service clients and servers simple and fun, with
plenty of working examples and code details so you can see just how
everything works.

of driving web traffic to web sites. Whether your web site depends on
broad, general traffic, or high-quality, targeted traffic, this PDF has
the tools and information you need to draw more traffic to your site, and
build your bottom line. You?ll learn how to effectively use PageRank and
Google itself--effective use of SEO means understanding how Google works:

effective SEO best practices, and much more.

The error would indicate that you do not have an imap server running on
localhost. Squirrelmail requires an imap server.

I have used squirrelmail with uw-imap. Easy to install and get running.

I think I got that subject line worded correct.

I am trying to set up the routing for a linux-server with two network 
interfaces, two subnets, and two routes.

The commands make sense but I'm not sure how to do it in the sysv ( 
Redhat/Fedora/WB/CentOS ) way.  I don't remember ever setting any routes 
using the standard init scripts etc. ( More system magic going on? )

The commands are:

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
     address 10.10.64.16
     netmask 255.255.255.0
     network 10.10.64.0
     broadcast 10.10.64.255
     gateway 10.10.64.1
     up /bin/ip route add 10.10.64.0/24 dev eth0 src 10.10.64.16 table 64
     up /bin/ip route add default via 10.10.64.1 table 64
     up /bin/ip rule add from 10.10.64.0/24 table 64
     post-down /bin/ip rule delete from 10.10.64.0/24 table 64

auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
     address 10.10.68.61
     netmask 255.255.255.0
     network 10.10.68.0
     broadcast 10.10.68.255
     up /bin/ip route add 10.10.68.0/24 dev eth1 src 10.10.68.61 table 68
     up /bin/ip route add default via 10.10.68.1 table 68
     up /bin/ip rule add from 10.10.68.0/24 table 68
     post-down /bin/ip rule delete from 10.10.68.0/24 table 68

The magic all happens in /etc/sysconfig/networking-scripts. The
routing config isn't really well documented, but it uses the "/bin/ip
route" syntax. Not sure about the "ip rule" routing policy parts. The
rest should be something like this:

Hardware failure, cosmic rays, and freak livestock accident are all at
the top of my list, just barely edged out by "forgot to have it start
on startup".

What distro are you using?

Ubuntu..  Dapper flight 6

I started it by hand..  

/usr/sbin/imapd


and it complained  and just hung



There is no script in /etc/init.d

Unless it has a strange name..

I think I will go with livestock accident..
I think I smell bovine GAS!!!!!

Thanks

Subject: [PLUG] Correct Web Page References on Two Servers
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0605301920510.13135@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My web site is hosted by my ISP, and the directory is ~/public_html/. In
the css menus, individual pages are referenced from the calling page as <a
href=/pagename.html>. When that link is selected, the new page loads in the
browser.

   However, I cannot get the same behavior locally. I just copied the site
from one local directory to /var/www/htdocs/appl-ecosys/, but when I point my
browser at index.html there, that's all that will load.

   If I recall correctly, the absolute path is relative to the document root
directory. On the production server that's ../public_html/ while on the
development server it's one directory higher in the food chain:
../htdocs/.

   Is there a way for me to refernce additional pages, the image and
publications subdirectories, and include files so that the whole site
displays properly in both places?

TIA,

Rich

I didn't catch what IMAP server you're using... Could it be starting
out of inetd?

Subject: [PLUG] Need help setting up my Atheros wireless card on a pure
	Debian system
Message-ID: <447D1355.7090802@yahoo.com>

Hi all.

       Recently I decided to switch from Fedora Core 5 to Debian Etch 
v3.1 and thus far, I am happy with my decision to do so. The only real 
difficulty I am having with Debian is that I don't know how to get my 
Atheros card to work correctly. Does anyone know how to detect and 
install a new interface for my wireless card--preferably by using a 
command?  I've installed the most recent version of madwifi-ng-tools 
package from debian-unstable distribution.


       Thanks in advance.

I don't see any initscripts listed below.

http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/mail/uw-imapd
http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?searchmode=filelist&word=uw-imapd&version=dapper&arch=i386

Dunno, I don't know anything about UW other than the legions saying
"don't use it". For a small installation, you might try dovecot
instead. For a big installation, go w/ Cyrus. Both packages for Dapper
appear to have initscripts. ;-)

Robert,

I believe that the Atheros card is already supported with out the use of 
mad-wifi. However, you do need to activate the connection. Have you done 
that?

You can't play DVDs with the open-source nv driver?  Works fine for me.

I was under the impression the only thing the proprietary driver was 
good for was 3D acceleration.  I've not bothered with it myself.  This 
machine came with the proprietary driver pre-installed, but I never 
replaced it when I reinstalled.

<snip lots of useful stuff>

I know the previous model/version of this camera, the Canon PowerShot 
S2, works with gphoto2 via PTP.  My initial presumption was that the 
PowerShot S3 should do the same, but that's what I began to have doubts 
about.

Alas, this camera doesn't do RAW, which was a complaint of some more 
advanced users who were otherwise enamored of it.  But I'm not advanced, 
so I figured I could live without it.

Should have the camera in a day or two and I'll be going up to Spokane 
on Friday, so I should return with lots of blurry, red-eyed, poorly lit 
and badly framed snaps of my new 1st-cousin-twice-removed, who's only a 
few month old and will have to live them down for the rest of her life.  
Isn't technology wonderful?  :-)

If you are just using client mode, i've found madwifi-old to be quite
stable.  Check out the svn snapshot and build against your current
kernel.  See: 

  <http://www.madwifi.org/>

and 

  <http://madwifi.org/wiki/UserDocs/GettingMadwifi>

madwifi-ng is relatively unstable and, depending on what you're doing,
panics the kernel from time to time.

The information on working with with GRUB in the Linux Cookbook (Carla's 
book) is really excellent.  The information about LiLo is probably just 
as good, but I don't use LiLo so I skipped that part.

This is the MAC OS compatibility page for the S3 IS on Canon's site, but it
talks about PTP.

Dan.  Thank you.  It was the route-ethx information I missed seeing.

Well a closer look shows the script is suppose to be in a non-existant 
directory.  '/etc/sysconfig/network/scripts/' doesn't exist on any of 
the ( Redhat/Fedora/CentOS ) systems I've checked ( so far. )

I can't even find how those files would be called.  I do remember from 
years ago there being a route in init.d but a quick check on a couple of 
systems doesn't find it any more.  The rpm database shows an iproute.

Any other suggestions or places to look?  I'll start the Google searches 
now that I have a clue as to what I'm looking for.

Again thanks,
Rod

Oops, my transcribing was bad. Should be in:
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/

The route config file doesn't exist by default, and was new as of RH9:

If you change all of your referances from absolute paths to relative
paths, it will display correctly in just about any environment.

Good luck,

I was thinking that but then couldn't find any route-* files ( assuming 
there would be at least one. )  I also was thinking it was bsd vs. sysv 
issue and I mis-communicated what I was trying to do.

Thanks for the link.  Seems I've not had to do any multiple route stuff 
for many years -- 2003 was the change.

Correct.  Because /index.html is looked for as 
/var/www/htdocs/index.html and all absolute ( httpd ) paths start at 
/var/www/htdocs.

As Derek says you can change to relative paths.  You couldalso put all 
the files in /var/www/htdocs/appl-ecosys/ into /var/www/htdocs/ and your 
absolute paths _should_ work.

   Thanks, Derek. I've no idea when or why I started putting a forward slash
on the addresses. It's been so long I took it as a given that they were
needed. My local testing tells me they're not needed here, and I'll test it
live later today.

   I changed the absolute paths to relative paths in the menus on all pages.
It now works fine except that I cannot return to the home page (index.html)
from any other page. I can navigate from the index to any other page, but
cannot go in the reverse direction.

   Is this something to do with the name of the page (index.html), or have I
lost a path reference to it in my changing of href="/ to href=" everywhere?

TIA,

Rich

href="../index.html" does not work?

Sounds like an overenthusiastic sed command.

Alan,

   Something like that. I did find the error just now and I'm correcting it.

   I'm going with blosxom <http://www.blosxom.com/>. A single, 444-line perl
script with a lot of flexibility and plugins available. No dbms back end, no

I have had pages on a company site that got deleted MONTHS before anyone 
noticed.  Does not suprise me a bit.

   You're very kind, Alan.

Careful there, a light implementation does not translate into an "easy for an
amateur like me" to use application.

Warning #1:  the date stamps of your files determines the blog order.  Copy some
files around and your blog changes article ordering.

Perhaps a stronger hint comes from http://blosxom.org/blog/ which has a banner
that reads:

  blog about blosxom powered by Movable Type

      prepared to discuss one or two of his favorite hacks from 
      Linux Server Hacks.  This should get us started.

I'm using dovecot and it just plain worked out of the box. I didn't have
to change /etc/dovecot.conf at all.

For dovecot config info, see...

/usr/share/doc/dovecot-<ver>/configuration.txt
(at least, that's where it is on RHEL4)

   OK. For the moment I don't anticipate that being an issue here. I assume
that when you write, "copy some files around," you're referring to moving
them on the server from one directory to another. Yes?

   May very well vary with the specific application, intensity of use, site
complexity, and other factors. Now the advantages are 1) ease of setup, 2)
ability to use it on my current site host, and 3) no need for mysql and all
that entails.

Thanks for the heads-up,

Rich

I just wasted two hours on trying to get this 'easy for an amateur like 
me' blog software to work.... UGH! It still doesn't work.... with 
WordPress I had already written two blog entries and changed the 
templates.... Good luck Richard. I hope it is easier for you than it was 
for me.... I gave up on it.

Christian,

   Sorry to read it was so frustrating for you. I'll let you all know my
experiences after I get to activating it. Right now it's only on the
development server and I've a ton of work revising the site before I get to
that.

I never noticed any 3-D acceleration, but I don't think I have anything
installed that uses 3-D anyway. As for the "nv" driver and DVDs, I
tried for months, scouring every how-to, wiki page and Linux/Ubuntu
forum for the secret to getting DVDs to play. I tried Totem, VLC, and
several others. Some would launch and just do nothing. Others would
lauch and immediately disappear from the screen. Sometimes I could see
an error message just half a second before they disappeared, but too
fast to read it. I tried launching from the command line, but never got
an error message.

I had heard from several that such problems with Ubuntu-64 could be
resolved by installing the Nvidia propietary drivers, but the
instructions I found were just too daunting. Pages of instructions.
Finally one day I found instructions for installing the Nvidia drivers
that were simple and easy to follow. I did it, and thereafter Totem
played DVDs flawlessly.

So now I'm gonna reinstall them from the same instructions. :)

Subject: [PLUG] Error in Including One Web Page in Another
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0605311736060.5376@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'd greatly appreciate a pointer to help me find why I'm getting a SSI
error when including "header.html" in each page.

   Following the suggestion at
<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/ssi.html>, I added a #config errmsg
just after the #include line. Sure enough, the default errmsg text shows up,
but it doesn't tell me why. Or, in which file I have the error. Of course, I
didn't see that error message scrunched up at the very top of the displayed
page until I uploaded the so-far-revised site, so it's visible (barely)
there.

TIA,

Rich

   Update: I corrected another error in index.shtml and extraneous text no
longer appears on the production server. But, the SSI error message is still
visible on the development site. Any ideas why?

   I suppose that as long as there is no visible message telling me I don't
know SSI on the production site, I shouldn't worry about seeing it on the
development site. But I do. It is not elegant because there is some
difference I would like to identify.

I can vouch for Aracnet, now SpiritOne, also.  I signed up in '99.  I've
had only a few hours of down time due to them.  The rate is $172/year.

I have my main site on their server while I have a static IP home and
serve our personal web stuff from there.  I also send what uploads to my
site to my home, too.

Huh ... I wonder if it has something to do with the "...64" part?  I 
never had a problem with DVDs, once I installed the necessary decoder 
that the MPAA and U.S. Congress conspired to outlaw, just using the "nv" 
driver.  That's been true on Debian and Arch Linux; I guess I haven't 
actually played a DVD on Ubuntu, come to think of it, but .  As is often 
the case with me and computers, I'm as mystified by why things work as 
expected as I can be by why things don't.

I'm curious about what advantages you get from running the 64-bit 
version.  From what I've read, I thought the advantages over 32-bit were 
limited to mathematical calculations and that it wasn't worth the hassle 
if you aren't doing a lot of 64-bit calculating.  (Well, that and being 
able to address way more RAM than I have.)  Are there other benefits 
that I don't know about, or is it that you're doing these kinds of 
calculations?

I think rssh or scponly might work:

Both are in the netbsd pkgscr tree, probably open and free too.

Message-ID: <1148754829.44789b8db3523@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I want to use kernel 2.4.32 instead of 2.4.24 and I'm using 2.4.26 right
now.  Thing is, the newest 2.4 kernel that is supported by the hostap
kernel patches appears to be 2.4.24.

http://hostap.epitest.fi/

Why are the patches so far behind the newest kernel releases even for 
the 2.6 branch?

Is there a way to use the hostap driver without installing it directly
to the kernel tree?  If you security patch, this can break the hostap
patch.  Say you go to http://openwall.com/ to pick up the latest 
privacy patches for the proc directory.

Why isn't hostap a standard part of the kernel at this point?  It seems
rare that I want to set up a Linux server as a mere wireless station,
most often I need an access point.

Subject: [PLUG] Squid Slackware 10.1...
Message-ID: <1149044663.447d07b75690a@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

With any version of squid from 2.4 stable 6 up to the current
stable version compiled from source, trying to start the daemon 
bombs out with signal 6.  I'm wondering if there are special 
configure options that I need to know about.  I'm using a 2.6 
kernel, but with the 2.4.29 headers.  Is it compiling to the 
old headers and not working for that reason?

I'm trying to compile and run squid on an NFS root mounted Slackware 10.1 
system running on a K62-300 VIA VA503+ mobo.  The only thing I can get
working is squid -z.

In var/log/messages:
May 30 22:23:56 condor squid[28042]: Squid Parent: child process 28053 started
May 30 22:23:56 condor squid[28042]: Squid Parent: child process 28053 exited
due to signal 6

The following is what I run to do the configure step:
CC="gcc" \
CFLAGS="-O3 -march=k6" \
./configure \
--prefix=/usr \
--exec-prefix=/usr \
--bindir=/usr/sbin \
--libexecdir=/usr/lib/squid \
--localstatedir=/var \
--sysconfdir=/etc/squid \
--enable-delay-pools \
--enable-cache-digests \
--enable-poll \
--disable-ident-lookups \
--enable-truncate \
--enable-removal-policies="heap" \
--enable-xmalloc-statistics \
--enable-cachemgr-hostname=www \
--enable-linux-netfilter \
--enable-stacktraces

 Squid-2.5.STABLE14 is the version I'm trying to compile and run on
 Slackware 10.1.

Googling a lot, it appears that people who can get squid to compile and
run on redhat/fedora/etc. frequently can't get it to work
on slackware.  I'd rather not switch from slackware to say CentOS because
of how easy it is to get slackware to network boot in comparison, but I
am at a total and complete loss.

BTW: Where are squid's configure options documented?  The INSTALL and
     QUICKSTART offer no information about configure options.

Is a patch needed to make squid work on slackware?  Is pam required?

This is what I'm using as an rc file:
#!/bin/sh
# nome del file: /etc/rc.d/rc.squid
echo -n ' squid '
case "$1" in
start)
/usr/sbin/squid -D
;;
stop)
/usr/sbin/squid -k shutdown
;;
restart)
/usr/sbin/squid -k reconfigure
;;
*)
echo "Usage: `basename $0` {start|stop|restart}"

Subject: [PLUG] UW-Imap not running...
Message-ID: <1149056969.447d37c939450@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Firewalled off or blocked by tcp wrappers is a strong possibility.

Make sure you have visibility for squirrelmail.  If you are running
uw-imap on an ip address you have no route to from squirrelmail, it
definitely won't work.

One problem I'd run into with UW-IMAP is that it would crash when
it ran into non mail files and tried to treat them as such.

Blithely picking a domain name does not strike me as a very good
idea.  This is one of the major downsides of ip networking and
why it's too bad that everything is going to it.  People use 
unregistered names on private networks only to get in trouble
when they interact with the Internet.  The Internet domain system
was not designed with private networks in mind.  Indeed, ipv6 is
trying to make available a global ip for every computer on the
planet.  As far as finding names for that many ip addresses, unique
ones that is, good luck.  One approach to the problem is redesigning 
the resolver libraries so that you can set up your own private dns 
hierarchy that is not related to the Internet system.  Another 
meaningful approach is to set up smtp servers that work like squid 
instead of using ip masquerading to go beyond your private lan.

My tip is to find out what root domain names will never be used on the
Internet and look into naming private hosts with those domains.  For
consideration, will .pri ever be an Internet domain?  How about .cox,
.lan, .home, etc?  Using a private domain name internally and 
still managing to interact properly with the Internet, that's the real 
challenge.  I use a registered name internally and externally because
I don't know how to set up my MTA otherwise.  I doubt it's the best way 
to do things, have two different ip addresses in two distinct
networks for the same name.  Where trouble arises is when the headers
of your email repeat the same hostname twice in a row.

The problem I see with TCP/IP networking is that the protocols seem
to be designed from the mindset that they will serve clients on one huge
network.  This is rarely true in today's day and age.  With the shortage
of address space on the Internet, most organizations and individuals are
purusing network address translation to conserve address space, save money,
and ensure privacy.  IPv6's designers should have focused on this fact in
my opinion.  After all, you don't make all your private hosts directly
accessible from the Internet even if they are connected to it.  The other
gripe I have with IPv6 is that it's still experimental and I question if
it is going to be a true drop in replacement for IPv4 without obsoleting 
much of the installed IPv4 infrastructure.

I do not know how to enforce going from more restrictive tcp wrappers to less
restrictive ones without rebooting.  This is a common source of trouble when
setting up email servers.

Practically speaking, name shortage is a problem that will not be solved by
increasing the size of the ip address space.  There are only so many unique
names that aren't obnoxiously long.  I'm curious what is going to happen in 
the future when the available names are exhausted?

# netstat -nlpt

The latter at a root prompt will give you your tcp service ports, 
look for 143.

Internetwork name resolution is one area where I have great difficulty.
I would recommend using IPX/SPX instead of TCP/IP to implement a
private local area network except for the fact that IPX/SPX isn't 
free.

Get php webmail working checklist:
    0) Relevant IP routing, tcp wrappers, and firewalls configured.
    1) Name resolution is functioning properly.
    2) Imap server set up and working.
    3) Apache up and php functional.
    4) Webmail software installed and configured.

For many webmail programs, setting up your email system without it is a
prerequisite to using it.

I allowed Internet access to a webmail program on a web site for a while,
but it was too easily abused.  I now know that a jerk used eblaster
on a friend's computer to hijack our clear text transactions.  
Something to keep in mind, do you like webmail better than say, 
evolution or pine even?  Remote access via secure tunneling is something 
to seriously consider as a much more secure alternative.  I don't know
how to do this, but secret key authentication in place of passwords
could also be more secure.  You could carry the key on say a thumb
drive and replace it with a new secret every week or so.

Message-ID: <1149124244.447e3e94df48a@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Has anyone here modified the original XBOX to run Linux?  How does 
Microsoft's XBOX Live online system know that you've altered a unit?  
What is a modchip?  Does going the modchip route really allow someone 
to hide that their XBOX is Linux ready from Microsoft?  How does an 
ITX form factor Celeron compare to the XBOX as far as: running quietly 
and taking up very little space?

Why is XBOX so popular if it's nothing more than a low end PC that has 
been hardware modified so that it can run the XBOX operating system only?

Why modify an XBOX to run Linux instead of going with a Micro-ATX
or ITX form factor PC?  Isn't buying one encouraging the rage over
these things by giving them resale value?

On the other hand, there must be some reason why there are instructions
online on how to make these things run Linux.
